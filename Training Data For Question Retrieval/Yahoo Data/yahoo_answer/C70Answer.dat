f6e4526698ad112fa58d2badd73e2e1aaa	The person above me is a bit confused to say the least, They are thinking of John McCain. Newt would make a great president especially since he has more experience than all of Obama and his cabinet combined|`|rkRIYxi2aa	Yeah, Newt's in the mix for sure.  But the GOP is in a terrible mess right now so it's hard to imagine how it might play out.  Basically it has been marginalised as a regional party of the poor white southern states.  The faith placed in Bobby Jindal was blown away in his response to Obama's address to congress, its choice of Steele as chairman of the RNC is turning out to be a horrible mistake and having Limbaugh as its de facto spokesman epitomises how far it has fallen.  Gingrich is an ideas guy, churns them out a mile a minute but is, IMO, too wild to be a viable presidential candidate.  But 2012 is a long way away and a lot can change.  My guess is we'll see other figures emerge, there's certainly no lack of republicans with presidential ambitions.|`|RuUUPWYUaa	If the GOP, can only develop candidates such as Palin, Jandal, Rush, Steale, and now Gingrich; they don't deserve to represent the voices of the people; let along represent them in legislation.

Why continue to support failure as your only option?|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	He may think about it, but the religious right will never go for him.  He left his first wife while she was recovering from cancer for another woman.  He cheated on her with the woman that is now his wife.  He did all this while chastising Bill Clinton for his dalliance with Monica Lewinsky.  He's a hypocrite<br>  <br>  edit:  And to the typical white guy below me - I am not confusing Gingrich with McCain - on wikipedia you will find:<br>  <br>  Gingrich has been married three times. He married Jackie Battley, his former high school geometry teacher, when he was 19 years old (she was seven years his senior at 26 years old).They had two daughters and divorced in 1981. She claims he "discussed divorce terms with her while she was recuperating in the hospital from cancer surgery", an action that would later be used against him: In 1992, his Democratic opponent, Tony Center, ran an ad claiming that Gingrich had "delivered divorce papers to [Jackie] the day after her cancer operation," which was not true.<br>  <br>  In 1981, six months after his divorce was final, Gingrich wed Marianne Ginther. He remained married to Ginther until 2000, when they divorced. Shortly thereafter, Gingrich married Callista Bisek, with whom he later admitted to having had an affair during his second marriage, at approximately the same time that he was leading the Congressional investigation of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky<br>  <br>  McCain left his first wife because after she was severely injured in a car accident which left her not looking good anymore - another real nice guy

Even when banned, there were exceptions to the ban for collectors and certain enthusiasts that kept them in secure places and fired them on ranges.  There is no legitimate reason to simply own a weapon made and designed for warfare.|`|VG7k5QRFaa	Here's what private ownership of guns has done for Americans:<br>  <br>  1. School shootings<br>  <br>  2. Child killed his stepmother<br>  <br>  3. Children accidentally shooting relatives<br>  <br>  4. People shoot one another in fights<br>  <br>  Oh and don't tell me you'll shoot the criminals.  There are rarely any cases of that happening as criminals mainly catch you when you're not prepared or not at home.  You mostly take the weapons and wipe out yourselves, kill family members and handle disputes without the cops...But I guess the Republicans aren't interested in THOSE statistics.  They're interested in stalling Congress like children because they lost or in keeping guns on the streets because the NRA supports their party and would withdraw their support if the Republicans turned against them.  Same goes for the corporations and the tobacco industry.|`|aqeWwA71aa	you won't read it anyway, but there's a perfectly straight forward definition of "assault weapon" which we have banned in the past.  Li'l Bushy let the ban slide and now cops are picking up AK's and other assault weapons from kids off the street.  This endangers the cops, the kids and the populous at large<br>  <br>  Right now we have a ban on machine guns - ever worry about that one?  You have to put the transfer tax to get a machine gun?  Is that like a big deal?  No - it's not.  And an "assault weapon" ban isn't a big deal either.<br>  <br>  These weapons aren't needed on the street - they're dangerous and stupid much like gun paranoids.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	Assault weapons. Hmmm. <br>  <br>  Dems think that that is any weapons you can assault somebody with, right?<br>  <br>  Let's also ban knifes and baseball bats.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	To us conservatives...assault weapons are the mouths of liars like Pelosi and Obama...they should be outlawed|`|4lINNvG5aa	Simple, their goal is to take away ALL weapons but Saul Alinski has taught them to do thing in increments not all at once.  Like the frog in the boiling pot.<br>  Hillary wrote her thesis on Alinsky but did not learn his lesson.  She tried to jam health care all at once instead of first insuring the CHILLLLDREN (1-5) etc.  You would be under socialized medicine right now.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	No!<br>  <br>  Liberal Men and Most Democrat Men think that Firearms are "just too masculine".<br>  <br>  Liberals and most Democrat Men prefer little Dolls.....  Like Barbie.<br>  <br>  ("bob_fran", above doesn't know a thing.   A assault weapon is Actually ANY Semi-Auto.   Just like a little 22 rifles.)<br>  <br>   Will Liberals ever become men?  How cute they must be!!!!|`|kH0IxFa9aa	Ak47's that belong to the Military and not on the street with other USA citizens.<br>  Some of us are law abiding. But some are idiots that want to kill people.<br>  See what Mexico is going through with high powered weapons in the hands of the Cartels.|`|zj8HLXI3aa	Not a liberal, first off. Secondly, you shouldn't be so insulting to people who are obviously much more learned than you, and have higher positions in our society. They're trying to do what they believe is right. Disagree respectfully.<br>  Assault weapons, by their definition, are weapons that are either fully automatic or are of a design that centers around multiple target elimination or for use of combat with other humans (sawed off shotguns, etc)<br>  You're just picking a fight. Political fights are just annoying to look at.
P544Sbmqaa	Adult stem cells cannot do even a fraction of what we already know embryonic stem cells can do.<br>  <br>  Adult stem cells ARE used, I myself have had adult stem cell treatment in the form of a bone marrow transplant. However, the potential of adult stem cells are far more limited than that of embryonic stem cells.<br>  <br>  My problem with the controversy, is that no one seems to care that women are kiling embryos in vain attempts to get preg (even without the embryonic stem cell research, IVF kills more embryos than the research could imagine.  In fact, its the plethora of dead embryos IVF creates that allowed the possibility of embryonic stem cell research in the first place).  But when those same embryos can be used to help millions of people, its wrong.  THAT is what I have a problem with.  Its either wrong to create and kill embryos, or its not.  WHY the double standard?  If killing embryos is soooo bad, WHY are there not people trying to ban IVF?|`|7ONKVbbiaa	the answer lies WITH THOSE SCIENTISTS, who are directly involved with the work.. and have repeatedly stated, that the embryonic cells are far more reliable and likely to succeed in what they are attempting to do. <br>  The CONTROVERSY comes from outside.. ie, those who are not scientists, and yet want to impose their determination of ethics. Since most, if not all, other countries with the scientific skills to know.. SUPPORT the research, then clearly the only arguments are coming from the US. <br>  Just to offer you some perspective-<br>  my husband is one person whose disease (MS) has already robbed him of being able to walk or work.. and may, in years to come. turn him into a vegetable. If there was ANYTHING he could do, which would prevent someone down the line from this, he would do it.. and that includes sacrifice his own life, so someone else might live. <br>  What you know/think, might seem logical to you. For persons who PERSONALLY have the knowledge from first hand.. the reality is that the results CAN SAVE LIVES.  And the REAL immoral thing is to refuse to allow this knowledge to increase. Stopping the research WILL NOT STOP abortions. At least the 'result' may have some meaning to someone else.|`|CUVYxMF1aa	We have been funding non-embryonic stem cell research, it began under Bush.  It is successful and should continue.  Embryonic stem cell research has proven to be a failure, a waste of tax payer dollars and to many is immoral.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	It has already been shown the embryonic stem cells are better than anything else we can use.  They have much more potential to finding a cure than adult-converted cells.<br>  <br>  It isn't as if there is going to be doctors kidnapping pregnant women and forcing them to have abortions.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Well...the thing that many uneducated yet think they are educated people who self righteously blab on and on about this issue spreading untruths don't realize is that ONLY embryonic stem cells can re-create themselves to become any other cell forms.<br>  <br>  SO, in plain English and simple terms for the cretins around, what that means is one day they will find ways for organs such as the heart which becomes severely damaged due to a heart attack for example, to recreate healthy cells to replace the damaged ones so the heart will be healthy once again.<br>  <br>  The same with liver, bladder, kidney, etc.  Maybe one day these organs can completely recreate themselves using a persons own stem cells.<br>  <br>  New research this past week actually tells of (Canadian research proud to say) scientists who were able to take adult stem cells and make them behave like embryonic stem cells.  This is exciting news because it means perhaps one day we wont need the embryonic cells at all but ones own stem cells will help create new cells within the body.<br>  <br>  For morons who can't see the benefit of this well hey, if it doesn't happen in your lifetime too bad for you.  But it's a good thing we don't live in America and science moves forward because plenty of men, women and especially children are benefiting from this research.<br>  <br>  Anyone with half a brain can see the benefit and thank God for an American President with intelligence.  Push it on through bud.|`|rYE9VLQdaa	The reason why, is that while stem cells have been made from human skin cells, the method used to create those skin cells is with a retrovirus which may also cause cancer. While this method may eventually work without the cancer risk, research should not stop on what can actually be done with stem cells. Therefore there is still a need to use embryonic stem cells in research until the method of creating stem cells from scratch is perfected.<br>  <br>  One of my sources is listed below, but there is quite a bit that I have picked up from various articles on the subject that I have read in different books and magazines.|`|vQRRaKFZaa	The lines are the most pure because they haven't come from an already-formed organ.

In Texas for instance the Texas constitution makes this very clear<br>  <br>  Now, he may be able to seek contribution which would mean that he would get some money out of the house, but he cannot get ownership. It will be very Wisconsin law dependent. <br>  <br>  As far as alimony goes, yes maybe, it will depend on many factors, length of marrieage, his ability to go out and support himself etc, faithfulness of the spouse, whether he put off his career to care for the children.<br>  <br>  Thats how it works in texas anyway and we are a community property state as well.  I hope this was helpful.

Depression is never easy to cope with, especially with how things are going now with the economy as well as any other personal struggles one is going through.<br>  <br>  Second, let's consider what the Bible says regarding this subject of the Armed Forces? How does Jehovah God feel about ones joining in to "fight for their country or homeland?"<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:43-46: “YOU heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU; that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. For if YOU love those loving YOU, what reward do YOU have? Are not also the tax collectors doing the same thing?<br>  <br>  Yes, Jesus said that you continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you. The tradition of men at that time was to love your neighbor and hate your enemy. Jesus said the opposite. Jehovah God makes the sun rise upon wicked ones and righteous ones. The last part of verse 46 says, “if you love those hating you, what reward do you have?” In other words, If you love those loving you, so what? It is like saying, I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.<br>  <br>  It is very easy to love those who love us. It is pretty much automatic. Even criminals love other criminals.<br>  <br>  Another scripture that is really good to use is…<br>  <br>  1 John 4:20: “If anyone makes the statement: “I love God,” and yet is hating his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot be loving God, whom he has not seen.”<br>  <br>  When in the Army, isn’t it true that you are being taught to kill the enemy? Why are such ones who join taking it upon themselves to kill someone of the same religion and faith as them? Why are they taking matters that really should be left in Jehovah God’s hands? What does killing solve, except the grief of the families and friends of that slaughtered one? Has the world really gotten better due to these wars? Is there world peace on the earth now?<br>  <br>  No, the U.S. is still at war, after 7+ years. Even if all of the troops were taken out of Iraq, what about the 4,000+ ones who have been slaughtered? What about their families? Friends? Acquaintances? Loved Ones? What about them? What about their psychological state? Emotional state? What about the innocent victims that are caught in the crossfire? What about the troops who come back with severed legs, arms and a damaged psychological and emotional state? Ask yourself, was it worth all of that? Notice that political leaders who urge the wars never send their own children on the battle lines, but those of others?<br>  <br>  Is it worth for a parent/guardian to lose their child at such a young age or any age? And they are still fighting? Fighting for their country. Being called a hero. What exactly do they fight for? America is still fighting and will always do so. Why get involved in something that you cannot control?<br>  <br>  The reason why the world is in such disarray is because “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19) That wicked one is Satan the Devil.<br>  <br>  Now, we are getting into the crux as to why things are unfolding as they are. When you have the power to do something, you have a major influence on those around you. He has the whole world in his hands and he can mold ones in whichever way he wants. The way to combat him from influencing us is to take in accurate knowledge of Jehovah God and Jesus Christ and to exercise our faith in them. (John 17:3) Both Jehovah God and Jesus Christ are way more powerful than Satan is. Michael, the archangel, better known as Christ Jesus even cast Satan and his angels out of heaven (Revelation 12:9-12). Jehovah is Almighty so that takes care of that.<br>  <br>  It does not matter how and who you vote for in these elections. You can rest assure that whomever Satan the Devil wants to be in office come November 2008 will be there. You know the candidates. Whichever Satan wants will be there. Remember, it is not you solely that votes, but also Satan the Devil, who is influencing you to do his will by voting for the one he wants to be in office. All of this is so Satan’s will can be accomplished. Jehovah is allowing this to take place because He wants to prove that man cannot rule by himself.<br>  <br>  If Satan feels the war in Iraq should continue, it will, no matter how much humans cry, moan and campaign. Even if the war were to cease, there will be something worse that will take place. Remember, some of the synonyms for “Satan” and “Devil” means Resister, Opposer or Slanderer. Satan resists Jehovah God, Opposes Jehovah God, Slanders Jehovah God’s name. Jehovah God and Satan the Devil are complete opposites.<br>  <br>  Jehovah will step in, in due time and put an end to all of these rulerships.

If she arrives with tourist visa so when she arrives here with tourist visa then you marry her then you have to report and apply for Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). You  may go to www.uscis.gov, all the informations are there.<br>  <br>  My experience is: I arrived in USA with Fiancee Visa (my fiance (before we married) applied for Fiancee Visa from USA, submited all the documents that they required and paid the fee too, then after it's been approved for 6 months time, US Immigration will contact me through the Ambassy in my country. Then I had to submit all the documentation they required, it took about 2months, then they issued Fiancee Visa. <br>  So it took about 8 months for the process to get only Fiancee Visa.<br>  <br>  I arrived in USA with that visa type then we married and we reported and applied for Permanent Resident Card. My husband is the sponsorship for me, so there is table for how much money for his income that can support one immigrant, last year 2008 the limit earning is USD17,500 that qualify to sponsor "ONE" immigrant (there is table for it, you may find all things when you apply for Green Card). There is fee for this process, I had to go to biometric test (finger print), 4 months later they approved it and by submitting approval mail I applied for Social Security Nunber. One month later I got the SSN and then about 2 months from the approval, I received the Green Card. It took about 6 months. But a friend of mine who has the same issue, she got hers for about 9 months, so it depends of them.<br>  <br>  Since your fiance got the SSN, she may work legally and better to get driving lisence too after got the SSN.<br>  <br>  Hope it will help you.

If you want direction, seek Jehovah God, not the armed forces. That is just a way for one to retaliate against the "enemies." Consider what the Bible says about fighting "enemies."<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:43-46: “YOU heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU; that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous.

Think about the name itself - communism, from "commune", or group of people living together, usually for the greater good of the community. The whole premise of any system but pure, laissez-faire capitalism, is sacrificing the individuals rights for "the greater good." <br>  This morally obscene idea is ridiculous - taking away the rights of the individual so that the collective can survive? What good is a collective if the parts are mindless vegetables? And look at it where it's been practically applied - socialist countries do not advance, their economies are not very productive, there isn't much in the area of progress. It's stagnation - and the more socialist a country gets, the more stagnant it becomes. Is it really worth having a job and place to live if it the world around you is stagnant, even degenerate? <br>  Plus, let's not forget where all these miracles - protected jobs, houses, payments - come from. The rich. The rich are taxed, their money is taken from them often without their consent, to pay for you. How on earth can you justify forcing from another what belongs to them, so that you can benefit? It's not like communism/socialist governments just pull this stuff out of their asses. It takes skilled, productive labor and effort that must be controlled by the government - taxed. Remember, taxation is not always in the form of money, but is also in the form of controlling your best talent, your best ideas, etc. etc. <br>  <br>  Simply put - no, a country founded on the principle of individual rights could never create a system of communism/socialism.

s2IFFBhmaa	I shipped to Fort Jackson in July of 2007 for Basic Training. You will be in barracks (a bay) with 50-60 other soldiers with close bunks. The showers are open with 8 shower heads in the room but there are dividers in between. There is AC but sometimes it breaks and it gets too hot to sleep. You perform night guard as all branches of the Military do which is 2 hours of bay maintenance during the night. The layout is simple why do you need your own room? You are only in the bay to sleep. The drill sergeants come over loud speakers yelling "wake up! wake up!" and the lights are turned on at 0545 everyday and the lights go out at 2100 every night. As with Ft. Huachuca im not sure. Good luck through basic!|`|pEbFh5uXaa	it is a joke. jacko is the easiest basic. it is also a coed basic, so there will be females in your company. <br>  <br>  benning and sill are supposedly tougher but in tradoc they worry so much about injuring the sensitive soldiers that you will be left wanting more.<br>  <br>  what happens after an easy basic is soldiers go to war and then commit suicide because they had prior mental issues. then liberals blame the army and bush/obama and the war, not knowing the facts or caring to know them.<br>  <br>  ft. huachuca doesnt have a lot in the form of family services. its in the desert on the mexico border. for me it has a distinctive feeling of a classic frontier post.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	LOL.  In basic you will be in an open bay with about 59 other soldiers<br>  <br>  I don't think they have pictures of the barracks but this site can give you some info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jackson.army.mil/bct/bct.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jackson.army.mil/bct/bct.htm</a><br>  <br>  Never been Ft. Huachuca but never heard anything bad about it.|`|dSbAz63baa	Slogans are only a facade. I attended OSUT Fort Benning (toughest training)  however there's nothing so relaxin about Fort Jackson. <br>  <br>  We do combat live fire, convoy live fire, squad and partner live fire courses all while on the move and still maintaining accuracy in our shots. and thats just in basic training. In Infantry AIT we do even more advanced training with M16, M4, M203, SAW, M240, 50. cal, claymore, C-4, and the AT4, all of these are also fired at the army basic training no matter what your MOS. And the army Combatives (UAC) is also some of the the best hand to hand combat training you can get anywhere. I am myself a level 2 and planning on going all the way to 4. Also people from other branches need to come to the army to get advanced training. I'm also extremely proud of Rangers, green berets, knowing that theres nothing that can come close to compare to us. So its easy to see the Army is by far the best fighting force in the world which would explain the amount of soldiers being sent to war is much higher because they want to send soldiers that know how to fight over there : )<br>  <br>  Training never ends for Infantryman. We dont complete basic OSUT and resolve as a electrician, cook, exc...  Three years from now we'll still be training in combat weapons. It's our job. Infantryman are the real deal : )|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Nothing to it, pizza and beer every night and then they bring over the other recruits for relaxation activities!

bmCInR5qaa	We tried that once and Americans decide that's not really want.  It's Herculean feat of unconscious projection when people blame same-sex couples who cannot get married for destroying marriage--A real slap in the face to reason.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	I'm not sure what your agrument is. But I do find it interesting that there are people who are repulsed by homosexuality, but think nothing of adulterers.|`|mULVP4k4aa	Maybe I wouldn't be so opposed to those things but good luck enforcing those. But I do have a question for you. If we allow gay marriage why not go further. What about the Woman who is in love with her cat? And what about the guy who wants to marry his Car? And how about all those good fellows from NAMBLA who are in love with their 8 year old neighbor boy? Can we deny them their right to marriage as well? After all they were Born that way right?|`|lsAgxHp6aa	You're comparing apples to oranges.  Adultery and divorce are totally different subjects, and could conceivably apply to gay marriage as well.  What marriage is, and how seriously people take their vows, or how  a bad marriage  ends are entirely different things.|`|XsI7ISqsaa	yes you are correct. great question. like letting gays get married is an assault on marriage. theyve destroyed the sanctity of marriage by not allowing you to buy someoneones daughter at the markets to marry. after all thats the traditional marriage|`|YMFo5N2haa	ummm NO!  the defination of marriage is the joing together of a MAN and a WOMAN not a woman and a woman!|`|kBArsDGnaa	Why is it people  take two separate issues and blur them together in what they think are clever arguments?   These are two questions that can stand alone and should.  Your first question deserves to be discussed separately, but since you clearly have a set position on this issue, let us move on to your second question.  Here in Michigan, about a year or two ago,  The Michigan Supreme Court handed down a decision that made pellucid adultery should be treated as a sexual offense as the State laws were currently written.  They went on to advise legislators to amend the legislation so the ruling would no longer hold.<br>  Jailing adulterers for said offense is not practical in this workaday world.  Lost income, lost face in the community, and the myriad other things that go into the daily life of a family suggest a different course of action.  Further, These matters are between husband and wife, and none of your business or mine.<br>  As for jailing people for a legal divorce goes, it is evident that a certain bitterness has eroded common sense.  I prefer to keep our overcrowded jails available for crimes of violence.  Besides, in most divorces there is one party who has done nothing wrong and is already a victim.  To jail that person for the wrongs of another offends the very concept of justice.<br>  The State has a vested interest in protecting the sanctity of marriage and already has laws and rulings in place to do so.  If you are trying to make the point that there are married people who do not honor the sanctity of their own marriages,   I'm sure you'll find many who agree, and I'm one of that group.  This is a society that needs to relearn the concept of commitment, and that love is not a noun, but rather a verb.<br>  Put another way, Love is not a feeling, but rather what you do.|`|c1598042fa78193894e98293525c9a92aa	Obviously adultery is wrong, horribly wrong.  But neither divorce nor adultery are perverted. Homosexuality is a perversion.  This is a poor comparison.
ktMefP0oaa	Yes, the physical training is spelled out pretty clearly, and you must pass them all. Basic Training is the same for regular Army and National Guard.|`|OfhzZriSaa	yes, they can and they will.  i'm not quite sure how it works with the Army, but in Air Force basic trianing the people who couldn't meet PT requirments  had to go to "fit flight" until they could pass the entire PT eval.  it's a special flight where they basically PT you to death, i think.  and it delayed your graduation, you had to stay there until you could pass, and i think they were only allowed to eat certain things, too.|`|yKLBdoigaa	Yes, they could drop him into the really lazy platoon to work on himself before he goes to a real training platoon. I'm assuming your talking about basic training as well. It's also amazing what one can do when there is a instructor yelling at you though. So, don't feel too bad.|`|Im8G3mjRaa	Put him in Echo Company with all the other restarts and hold overs.|`|RyFCRcIUaa	Yes!

Banks began giving out loans to people who had no way to pay because they could package these bad loans with good loans in collateralized debt obligations, separated into 3 tranches of different ratings, and all of these loans were backed by homes that were exploding. The banks assumed that in the worst case scenario they could foreclose on these homes and turn a profit. Then we have insurance companies like AIG who began to engage in credit default swaps. A credit default swap is an insurance policy sold to people like pension funds on investments in these CDO's. Because AIG was willing to insure the investments in these terrible mortgage packages, the packages became AAA rated, or investment grade, and these pension funds were allowed to invest in them. The problem was that AIG did not have the capital to back up these insurance policies should these mortgages begin to go bad. So now you have banks forced to write down the value of these bad assets, which means the pension funds who invested in them had to attempt to collect their insurance policy on the investment from AIG, and AIG could not pay. So you have commercial banks, pension funds, investment banks all tangled up in the same bad assets. The banking industry has basically collapsed. Everyone in the media seems to be trying to stay upbeat, but this is easily the worst we've seen since the great depression. If you believe that a president is going to be able to solve this crisis in forty-five days, you are insane. However, I do see many positive changes now that Obama is president. He's closed down Guantanamo bay with the clear message that America does not torture. He has stated that American troops will be leaving Iraq by the end of 2010. He has sent an envoy to the Middle East and has made it clear that we will no longer only act unilaterally. He's passed a massive budget, which may be pork-laden, but provides money for state governments that had lost massive amounts of money in this crisis. He's expanded the state children health program and is going to invest a portion of the 3 trillion dollar budget towards public health insurance that will insure those without the able to get insurance. He's passed a bill that prohibits banks from charging homeowners more than 30% of their income. I don't think we've ever seen this much change within the first 2 months of a president's inauguration and, despite a few setbacks, I don't think I could be any happier with the way the government is being handled so far.|`|GyZNXq61aa	46 days is not long enough to change the world you have to remember it took eight years to screw it up.|`|YIWKPXokaa	Yes<br>  <br>  I changed my socks this afternoon.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Sure do.  It's reflected in the dropping of the stock market by 25% in only 6 weeks and unemployment rising, retail sales falling, government growing bigger along with the national debt and yet the people are happy as clams with their new leaders.

You could discuss briefly the history of the conflict from 1948-on, and then discuss the most recent conflict between Hamas and the Israeli military. If you are like me and believe that the Palestinians have been getting abused and generalized as terrorists for years, you could give statistics on the outrageously one-sided number of deaths of Palestinians to Israeli's and could discuss the facts that the Israelis expelled journalists and aid workers from entering Gaza and the West Bank. If you would like to defend Israel's latest confrontation with the Palestinians, you could discuss the right of self defense from Hamas's rockets.

Hopefully you're not one of them.<br>  <br>  My Dad had a horrific experience with the VA. He used it only for his medication. $1./90 day supply.<br>  <br>  It took him FOUR YEARS to have them switch his case from Buffalo to Tampa. He'd have to fly in twice a year to go to the VA in Buffalo. This for a guy in his 70's who wasn't in the greatest shape.<br>  Finally they got him in at Tampa - all he had to do then was DRIVE THREE HOURS to get there. I would fly down, drive him to Tampa, hang around as long as necessary, then drive him back to Longboat. It exhausted ME! He'd try to take a turn but I wouldn't let him.<br>  <br>  One and one-half years before his death they opened a 'sub-station' in Bradenton - good only for the basics and to pick up scripts. That was 45 minutes each way and if you had to be admitted - back to Tampa.<br>  <br>  For these reasons, they had MediCare AND Supplemental Insurance like I do. Costs a fortune, but, if you care about living you do it. My mother was not a veteran, alas, so she paid full freight for her scripts.<br>  <br>  When he needed surgery and subsequent hospitalizations before his death - THIS is what they used. He went to the Hospital down the street where he received excellent care. I wouldn't send my dog to the Tampa VA. All my folks did was worry about health care costs and they had insurance for which they sacrificed chicken wings and beer. They tried to pay my expenses, but I wouldn't let them. I lied and told them I could afford to go down there 4x/year to make the Doctor/Hospital rounds. Ha! I'm STILL paying back personal loans and Daddy's been dead for 3 years.<br>  I know where they were coming from. I'm lucky my local pharmacist is my friend and charged me cost. My brother is a doctor - out of state - can't help with any medication, but you DO get 'better' care no matter where you are.<br>  Now I pay approx. $220/month in Premium and $180/month in co-pays.<br>  This doesn't include the occasional ambulance ride or weird treatment.<br>  This is, of course, in addition to what they take to pay for MediCare now, and what they took the 35 years I worked and made a bundle and paid into the system.<br>  <br>  So quit your bitchin' about FREE health care. I'm sick of hearing it. Why did I pay and why am I STILL paying and you think it's okay to DEMAND FREE???|`|q4EXFhV7aa	VA benefits have been wonderful for our family....as have medicare for our grandparents and medicaid for my 3 foster children. All  have been vitally necessary and have allowed access to any doctor we choose, prescriptions, and the top specialists. While there ARE some problems with all 3 programs, comparative to private insurance there is simply no comparison....as private insurance is too costly, doesn't cover preexisting conditions in most cases, and the main goal is profit, not the care of patients.<br>  Anti-con is correct. Obama has never offered or suggested that he wants 'free' or 'universal' health care. His goal was to allow for more competition, so that prices are reduced and, thus, more people can be covered.|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Negative is not quite the right word! Being put through torture and hell on earth is a better description! The VA does everything within its power to deny a veteran any help and have a team of both doctors and lawyers that seek a way to screw you over and stall your claim for benefits for years and years hoping you will die in the duration relieving them of ever giving you anything you were promised upon enlistment that has a service-connection!|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	I get all my medical care at the Dayton VA Medical Center.

Oh if you are really sick or this is a life threatening problem please hang up and dial 911. Is this what you are talking about. Yes it is very personal, my husband.<br>  <br>  Are you ready for the pharmacy to come home with you. They have a pill for everything even if you don't have the problem they are treating you for. Gave my honey heart meds that almost killed him. <br>  <br>  Understaffed and overworked people are what you are looking at. A lot of the doctors are either retired or volunteering their time as a tax write-off. Not a very rosy picture for our health care in America is it?<br>  <br>  This is going to be the biggest blunder since Herbert Hoover was in office. <br>  <br>  We have to drive 135 miles one way to the VA hospital. That sounds exciting doesn't it. Remember Walter Reed hospital, that is veteran health care. Get ready for lots of deaths.

We were going to pony up $8 billion and they were going to let go the 120 or so MIAs that they had stashed in Laos so that whenever the subject came up they could (and did) say "There are no American prisoners in Vietnam."<br>  <br>  So, what happened? Well, first off, Dick Nixon was run out of office and the deal was left on the table. The POWs were known to have been alive as late as 1984 as there was a (now documented) Delta Force mission to go into Laos and get them. This mission, however, was leaked to the press (presumably by the very people who set the deal up in the first place as it would make them look bad (for starters, think Henry Kissinger)), and the mission was scotched within hours of its start.<br>  <br>  It's been assumed ever since that the POWs were killed shortly after that as the Vietnamese Communists, knowing that we not only knew about them and where they'd been but had the means to find them again, had no further use for them. It probably ended a living hell for the POWs.<br>  <br>  Yes, ANOTHER sad tale from the Vietnam War (and its long aftermath). Personally, I think the best way to repay the N.

7Tte9ohXaa	You do not need the Federal Firearms License unless you are in the business of selling firearms; that is the license you must be 21 to obtain.  It is not needed simply to own a firearm.<br>  <br>  Your individual state probably has laws regarding minimum age to purchase, licensing, waiting periods, etc.  As much as I dislike the NRA, their website has information regarding state laws.  See below.<br>  <br>  P.S. I don't know where you're planning on camping (the South Indian jungle?), but I truly doubt you'll be running in to any tigers.  Not that a pistol would help you if you did.|`|YPLydxcXaa	You cant simple as that, at 18 here you could own or possess a handgun for hunting and hiking,you must be 21 to buy one, also even having a pistol license doesnt let you carry it on public lands.They did just change that for some national parks (handguns were banned in them,no matter if you had a CCP or not) ,but in most state parks if you have a gun of any sort ,you must possess a valid hunting license not just a CCP. for camping a decent bear repellent pepper spray is your best bet,legally ,for defense from bears and small pests..most mountain lion attacks come from above and usually the victim doesnt get time to resist,so the best defense from them is keep your eyes open,they rarelyattack on the ground or maul victims,usually they drop out of trees or rocks and snap your neck ,so avoiding them is your best bet..always check with local authoritys where ever you hike or camp for problem predator activity in the area your planing to visit.Not just for the large predators ,but also nuisense pests like coons and skunks or potential threats like activly mating deer,elk or moose who can be very territorial .dont do anything to provoke or intice wild animals and you should be fine as long as you follow basic forrest rules.|`|tAR4T60aaa	don't get a gun. guns are evil.<br>  <br>  Peace, Love, and Harmony!|`|c3OQYlHRaa	Then don't go.  The laws are in place for a reason.|`|9PKLQQNfaa	If i remember correctly, you do have to carry out a background check BEFORE owning a hand gun. Which can be obtained through your local law enforcement office. You don't have to have a license to carry  a rifle while camping. Or anywhere at that fact. You do need to carry out the hunters safety course though. For hunting that is.<br>  But for protection, a rifle would be your best bet for any large cats that plan to eat you.<br>  :)|`|6Gfz125Paa	You do not need  a pistol to go camping.  There is no campsite where you would be running the risk of getting mauled by a tiger, and if there was, a pistol wouldn't help much.|`|AA10465540	Don't go camping where there are tigers wandering about.

58ab84c8e75323d12805f86da46b4590aa	Since everyone has answered no the US will not fall I will be the odd ball and answer Yes. Just for the fun of debate. All kingdoms of the earth have come and gone. Babylon, Greece, Sumeria, Egypt, England, Spain, and eventually the United States as well will stumble. I do not know if the issues facing the Us currently could be the demise of this country but it as I see it is a sign for us as people of the great country to be vocal to those who we elect to do what we elected them to do and that is to represent the people. Until politicians learn that the people make this country we are headed down that road that these previous nations have. So what must we do if it will fall?

AA11916920	I agree with you and the control they want to have.  There are programs where the government will help with health care, but they are more like Medicaid and other programs.  I don't think the Government should control health care, if they want to control it, maybe they should control how much the private sector charges.  However, everything is about profit these days.|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	Well, it is not just about helping poor people pay for their health insurance. <br>  <br>  My cousin had a baby and things were nicked and all and the result of that was that she had to have 3 more surgeries to correct what happened. This was something that happened to her, not the result of lifestyle of substance abuse. Now, insurance companies say that she is uninsurable and won't give her any insurance at all. And I don't know of many people who can afford to have no health insurance at all.<br>  <br>  Insurance in the US is absolutely out of control and what is what the government is wanting to correct.<br>  <br>  It is so bad that the US' health care system don't even register in the top 20 in the world, this is according to the World Health Organization. Something has got to give in our health care system and subsidizing it will only serve to make our deficit even larger than it is now which ultimately will help no one.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	You've got it, it's all about control. What you wrote is correct, if the government really cared so much about people getting health care, then they should just subsidize it. That just shows, it's not their intent.<br>  <br>  It's not different than the governments dislike of school vouchers. There are inner city government schools that are atrocious. School vouchers (which are awarded by lottery) give parents in these areas a chance to send their kids to private schools. This idea that private schools are only for the elite is nonsense. If the government just gave parents the amount the government spends on each child, that would pay for it.<br>  <br>  The governments wants the power and they keep pushing this piss poor plans to keep it. They don't give a damn about the people when it really comes down to it.<br>  <br>  Added: "andrew k" - Your link there is from "The World Health Organization's ranking". I don't believe that crap for a second. Great Britains health care along with Canada is NOT better than the USA. Why do Britains have horrible teeth? Why to Canadians all come to the U.S. in droves for health care? For fun? It's a fact. Their systems suck.|`|IGXE3aDraa	well let me give you an example I have an aka (above the knee) amputation and almost all the insurance companies I have had through my life do not cover prosthetics something I need to walk. even though I pay for health care they deny the fact that I need this device to keep my hips stable. its not just poor people I pay currently 900 for 3 months of health insurance coverage.|`|0UV0PwDLaa	They need to make stricter insurance laws before anything else. I know many people who have died while waiting for live saving treatments to be approved.<br>  <br>  Deep's(the girl above with the above knee amputation) example is another example. <br>  <br>  Insurance companies are FULLOFSHIT I think both sides agree they need to be accountable.|`|r6dsc5fNaa	Because the United States' health care is 37th overall, which is really bad, considering we're supposed to set the example for the world.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Because if they subsidize it, the insurers can simply raise the prices.  <br>  <br>  That's one of the reasons health care is so expensive in the US, because the goverment subsidizes it for the poor (through Medicaid).|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Perhaps if you better understood what is going on it would be easier for you to understand.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	That is the plan right now.  Look at the last link.<br>  <br>  FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.|`|Fyq5nK4waa	There is no magic pill from either the private sector or the government that will make health care perfect.  People need to take responsibility.  We are a country that  2/3 of it's people are over weight.  As a country, we eat the worse foods possible.  We live for the moment and do not consider the future.  <br>  <br>  Real health care reform starts with the individual.  By living a healthy life style, everyone would feel better, be more productive, and save money.  We would not need to pump trillions of dollars into Health Care that can be prevented.|`|4fda62554c07de687e2ca85293849ac6aa	The government has tipped their hand.  If they really cared about individuals getting health care you could deduct health insurance from your income tax.  Only employer furnished health insurance is tax deductible.  The reason is obvious, they don't care about health care what they want is control.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Becuase socialism demands control.

So state congress would obviously receive less.  In state congress senators tend to be electe for only 4 year terms.  and it takes 5 years to get a pension.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Members are eligible to start collecting at age 62 if they have at least five years of service.

Waiting for the American System of Justice to protect you or your children will end up with bad results....they step in only after a crime has already been committed and not a minute before! Criminals have more rights than anyone and dead people have no rights in America! That molester is just waiting to get his filthy hands on your kids! Turn the tables on him!

Keeping then away from this monster is your only task.  Your mother is a weak woman, and it's understandable you do not wish to tell her, however, I think you should.  You could tell her in writing via email or letter to make it easier for you.  HOW DARE SHE allow that man to be that way.  Why, after molesting your sister (you STILL are not sure if it's true??!!), would you have anything to do with this man.  <br>  <br>  Cut them both off, let your mother know if she dumps him she can come back into your life (or after he dies).  Otherwise, you're risking your children.  Tell them Grandpa and Grandma are not good people and sorry, find another relative for them to visit.|`|nGafpEwoaa	It's time your mom knows all about your step (abusive) father.  This secret has gone on long enough.  There is no reason you shouldn't believe your older sister.  Just consider yourself lucky it didn't happen to you.  Your older sister needs validation from you.  She needs your support.  <br>  <br>  You can't worry about your mom being emotional,  because she's going through menopause.  She has the right and should know about the past and now the present.  If you think she needs proof save all text messages he sends.  One or two should do it.  <br>  <br>  DO NOT!  let you step father near your child.  He's a pedophile and he will do the same to your child as he's done to your older sister.  Now you can be assured that your older sister has indeed been molested by you step father.  Your son doesn't need a grandparent who will most likely molest him/her too.  He's just waiting for the chance to be alone with your child.  <br>  <br>  Your mom will either believe what you "have" to tell her or she won't.  That's up to your mom.  She might need some time to think things through.  However, that doesn't mean you have to.  As long as he has the guts to text you in the matter he has, that's all you need to know what he's all about.  Once a pedophile always a pedophile.  Nothing changes.  All that matters to him is that he picks his next victim.<br>  <br>  There's no reason to go to your mom's house to visit if she is capable to come and visit you and her grandchild ALONE!   It's up to you to protect your child from any preditor, which happens to be your step father.  And that can happen at your mom's house or your own house.  Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.  It happened to my own baby (now grown with a family of her own) right in the next room of my mom's house.  I wish I knew then what I know now, because this would never have happened.  It's difficult to even talk to you about this, but if it will help protect your child, I'll tell anyone.  Both my parents are gone now.  If I knew then what my own father did to my baby I can't tell you what I would have done.<br>  <br>  It's not a good story, but it is a true story for both you and me.  Your child can have a better grandfather figure than a pedophile.  He needs to go to jail.<br>  <br>  Love you .... do what your gut is telling you.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	Sadly, I expect you will find the fine print on the agreement you signed when you sent the money requires that this go to arbitration instead of to court. <br>  <br>  I would assume that the arbitrator specified in the agreement is legitimate, and I don't know what if anything it will cost you. Many companies put this kind of requirement in to avoid getting hit with class action lawsuits that can cost millions of dollars. In order to "get away with it" and not get the government and media all over them, they usually make it very easy and inexpensive to get this kind of arbitration. After all, they aren't going to go out of business if you win, it's small potatoes, they are trying to stop people who file lawsuits at the drop of a hat, or who are just scamming and trying to force them to settle to avoid a big legal bill. <br>  <br>  The only alternative might be to try to file a complaint with:<br>  - the attorney general in your state who may have regulatory or investigative power<br>  - the BBB<br>  - possibly the FCC has jurisdiction, not likely but possible.<br>  <br>  I suspect though if you have a local consumer help line at one of your radio or tv stations, and if you write very polite letters of complaint to the people I've listed above, you MIGHT get them to take a look at it in order to avoid bad publicity or investigations that are a pain to deal with if nothing else. But really you probably have to go through arbitration.

Ultimately, his doctrines lead to the October Revolution in Russia in 1917, and Lenin taking power and overthrowing the Czarist government. Marx dreamed of a classless society, but much like Orwell's " Animal Farm", the power corrupted the movements leaders. Stalin murdered millions of his own people.

All wealth is distributed evenly. The most basic problems with this theory are the lack of motivation from the workers to be innovative or even to be more productive since there is no chance of moving beyond one's social class. As well, there is no negative reinforcement when someone does a poor job. There is no point in firing someone if they will continue to reap the benefit of everyone else's work. <br>  <br>  It's a far cry from people like Obama or Hilary, who are more akin to social democrats.

The contestant innocently replied "I love my husband," to which Groucho responded with the now famous "I love my cigar, but I take it out once in a while!" The audience laughed for minutes.

What is being proposed is subsidized health insurance, not the delivery of health care by the government.  When you get your mind around that then perhaps you might start being able to discuss it in a rational manner.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	<<Who will be the winners?>><br>  <br>  all of us.<br>  our life expectancy will increase from 30th or 38th, depending on which table you choose, to somewhat closer to that enjoyed by people in all those socialized medicine countries that you seem to not like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cou...</a>|`|AA11086243	there's rationing now... just by price...<br>  <br>  I know two people that died because they couldn't afford proper care for their cancer... <br>  <br>  I'm at the point where I would rather have some guy in government doing it, than some guy at a desk at an insurance company doing it, who gets a huge bonus if he denies me...

That's a much better system.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Socialized roads means that there will be government rationing.|`|k0jcYvX0aa	We will all be the winners if the cost per insured averages around $3,000 in the socialized program.  The average cost for insurance in the United States is now over $6,000 per insured.  We are losing money fast because of the emergency care that by law (and ethics) must be given to those without insurance.  Prevention comes with being insured and prevention costs far less than dealing with a health issue that rises to a crisis stage.  Long term care becomes more prevalent due to inadequate health care.  Socialized health care provides a far larger underwriting pool and this will have a positive affect upon the insurance rates.|`|7b30cd2ddc0ec6ae3f9c56fb6cce9ff1aa	The government runs the care for both veterans and for senior citizens under medicare. This means that the government already covers a large chunk of those who cost the most in health care costs. The problems with the private profit-motive based corporate care are myriad and ubiquitous. Because of their profit motive, these corporations are shortsighted and not looking out for the best interests of us as consumers. They are in the business of risk-management and use statistical models to determine who they cover and who they do not. They simply cherry-pick the young and healthy and refuse to cover those who need it most. They are also notorious for denying care to their customers because of pre-existing conditions that may or may not have existed prior to purchasing the policy, and they also review policies for errors prior to payment in order to avoid paying. This leads to people who DID manage to get this private insurance suffering and dying because of denied claims. Nearly every doctor I know despises the private system because they no longer are allowed to determine what a patient needs or does not need. For instance, my dentist is required to tailor the care he gives to his patients around the guidelines decided by a committee of insurance company businessmen and not by a health care professional. The price of the private system is also a huge concern for all of us. We spend more in premiums than we ever would in taxes for a public system, and we're getting statistically much worse care. We spend more per capita on health care than any industrialized country in the world, and yet we have lower life expectancies and higher infant mortality rates. We are the richest nation in the world and yet we have 55 million people who are not covered, including children. These facts are all disturbing. In most arguments I could argue either side well because both sides have their merits, but in this particular case I honestly don't think it would even be possible for me to argue with continuing this miserably flawed private system. A single payer public system will be cheaper, more efficient, and will cover everyone.  I will point out, though, that Obama's plan is not to get rid of the insurance companies. They have a strong lobby and no one expects that the private system will be abandoned completely like it should. The Obama plan simply creates a public insurance policy for those who can't get coverage and forces the private companies to compete with this public fund. Will the private companies be able to compete? If they do, good. That would mean cheaper prices all around like in Germany. If they don't compete, good. That would mean we have an effective government care program like in Britain.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Yes - what really helps is that you keep telling the republican lies.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	The rich.  They will be the only ones who can afford healthcare then.  If the gov't doesn't have enough money to pay for treatment, they will still be able to pay privately for it.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I think you are very misinformed. It means that instead of me buying my insurance from Blue Cross who won't even take me but when they would they said it would be $1200 a month I can pay $400 a month & have insurance & the waste the comes from wrong testing & all the coruption in the medical feild will not be allowed.

Division, doubt, and fear are the weapons he uses within one nation arrayed against him. His purpose is summed up in his own phrase-to sow (lies) "mental confusion, contradiction of feeling, indecision, panic." Hitler<br>  <br>  Since Hitler's type of propaganda is a weapon constantly used against us, we need to understand clearly his techniques and devices-not only those employed today, but also the cunning and diabolical methods by which he and his Brown Shirts (Obama's 7 million people civillian National security force) combined propaganda and other pressures, first to take over the German state, then to stamp out all vestiges of freedom in it.Futhermore the liberal socialist biased media outlets codependant his progress with their propaganda.<br>  <br>  "Any dictator would admire the uniformity and obedience of the [U.S.] media" - Noam Chomsky|`|7bIrMvziaa	You are describing Hitler, but he mirrors Stalin more.<br>  It would be better under Stalin, at least you wouldn't get baked in an oven, even though life would suck due to limited rights.|`|IENxRde0aa	Hitler.

What rock are you living under?<br>  <br>  "He took over the automobile industry and wants to create an economical, environmentally friendly car for the people."<br>  He didn't go out of his way to do this, the auto-makers asked for the government intervention.<br>  <br>  "He used coercion to gain control of the banking sector and browbeat any CEO who dared stand up to him."<br>  Once again he did not go out of his way to do this, the CEOs came to the government with tin cans. Perhaps you should stop trying so hard to twist facts in a vain attempt to present Obama as a mirror image of Stalin.<br>  <br>  "He plans on taking care of all the people by controlling what industries can produce."<br>  Putting words in his mouth does not = him saying those words. I don't believe he has any such desires other than stopping companies from producing things that harm the people. Preventing harm to the people is the government's job.<br>  <br>  "He is highly agitated at the previous administration and will consolidate power by ridding himself of opponents all in the name of 'justice'."<br>  Him and...79% of the population are highly agitated at the previous administration, myself included. He is not going to consolidate power by by ridding himself of opponents all in the name of "justice." He has done nothing of the sort and I don't believe he ever will. You paint Obama as this power hungry madman, in reality he is nowhere near it. Maybe you should take some time to learn about the man before passing such a harsh comparison.<br>  <br>  "His handlers have full control of the media and he wields their influence at his will."<br>  Haha. It isn't his fault the media and the majority of the country like him, they just do. The media was liberal long before the time of Barack Obama. He exerts no control over the media and he doesn't have to as he has nothing to hide.<br>  <br>  "He plans on silencing dissenting viewpoints through regulation, not legislation."<br>  When did he ever show any signs of doing that? I'll answer my own question, HE HASN'T!<br>  <br>  "He has labeled those in the opposition as domestic terrorists."<br>  If this is a comment related to the memo released you seem to forget that Bush ordered that investigation and that Obama did not write the memo.<br>  <br>  "His first action in power was massive public works projects."<br>  Not really a bad thing. Especially when your country's infrastructure is as bad as ours.<br>  <br>  "He was a strong advocate of unions and insured employees wielded great control over their employers."<br>  Unions are not evil and most do not wish to control their employers, they exist so that workers are treated fairly. I believe fairness is a core principal of this country.<br>  <br>  "He used the bully pulpit with ruthless abandon all in the name of the people."<br>  When?<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you sir, stop twisting facts and learn something about the man you seem to hate so much. He is not a mirror image of Stalin or Hitler. The only place he comes close is in your reality-neglecting corner of the world. Just stop and take in the reality that you are wrong. Your irrational hate of this man won't stop the majority of the country from loving him nor will it stop him from doing his job.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Hitler.|`|G49lKR56aa	The only one that is as good as obama, is clinton!|`|hhJrwRNdaa	The history of Obama since child hood falls into the same mold of several leaders who were Obsessed with power, money and prestige.<br>  <br>  All 14 of you observation are major manifestations of the Obsession.

Telling me how people shake their hands, and thank them for being willing to serve, and fight, for not only our own freedoms but so that others may have them also.<br>  <br>       But he also told me about an incident in the grocery store he stopped at yesterday, on his way home from the base.  He said that ahead of several people in front of him stood a woman dressed in a burkha.  He said when she got to the cashier she loudly remarked about the U.S. flag lapel pin the cashier wore on her smock.  The cashier reached up, touched the pin, and said,“Yes, I always wear it.”<br>  <br>       The woman in the burkha then asked the cashier when she was going to stop bombing her countrymen, explaining that she was Iraqi.  A gentleman standing behind my son stepped forward, putting his arm around my son's shoulders, and nodding towards my son, said in a calm and gentle voice to the Iraqi woman, "Lady, hundreds of thousands of men and women like this young man have fought and died so that you could stand here, in MY country and accuse a check-out cashier of bombing your countrymen.  It is my belief that had you been this outspoken in YOUR OWN country we wouldn't need to be there today.

The Saddam regime was undemocratic, despotic and brutal against political dissenters but also secular. Women had equal rights. Now in some parts of the country Taliban like gangs rule with US backing.<br>  <br>  Historically, Iraqi women and girls have enjoyed relatively more rights than many of their counterparts in the Middle East. The Iraqi Provisional Constitution (drafted in 1970) formally guaranteed equal rights to women and other laws specifically ensured their right to vote, attend school, run for political office, and own property. Yet, since the 1991 Gulf War, the position of women within Iraqi society has deteriorated rapidly. Women and girls were disproportionately affected by the economic consequences of the U.N. sanctions, and lacked access to food, health care, and education. These effects were compounded by changes in the law that restricted women's mobility and access to the formal sector in an effort to ensure jobs to men and appease conservative religious and tribal groups.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	They're still not allowed to drive, but now they're allowed to ride in the car as opposed to running alongside it.|`|AA10465540	Actually Iraqi women had more rights when Hussein was in power|`|95gEZ22Caa	I don't know american news medias say nothing about that or anything else from the front-lines of Iraq.

PWvS7vqPaa	I understand how you feel.  For all intensive purposes, you are the victim here and are going to be out $100, and yet you are being treated like a criminal.  All you wanted was some acknowledgment and compassion for your situation, yet they could not step off their high horse long enough to see it from your side.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you have to see it from their point of view.  If someone whom you had never met gave you a counterfeit $100 bill, you would be a little suspicious of them too.  You would have no idea if they had genuinely been duped into passing it along or if they knew it was counterfeit and what they might do if they were found out.<br>  <br>  All in all though I agree with you and think you have every right to feel a embarrassed and annoyed.|`|dSLCH5gHaa	This is the exact type of thing I hate, some employees have no idea what customer service and interaction.

She went to her supervisor, however they never took the bill out of site.  They did not let me take it back either.  It's policy and law to prevent the further use of the bills.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	did you see their id's?  i wouldn't trust anyone but an official that can prove who they are.  what if it's not counterfeit, you're out $100.00!  i would go back to costco and raise hell with the manager until you get a satisfactory answer.  remember, counterfeiting is a federal offense.  if you're not satisfied with costco's explanation call the FBI.|`|jWO10NN5aa	Here is what happened:  Earlier in the day they accepted a counterfeit $100 bill from some other customer without realizing it at the time that it was counterfeit.  When you came in later and handed them a real $100 bill, they took it into the back and switched it.  This way, you get stuck with the loss instead of them.  You have no way of knowing if the counterfeit bill they showed you was the one you handed over to them in the first place.  Sounds like thievery to me.<br>  <br>  What a cashier will always normally do when they are handed a large bill like that is to take one of those special markers for detecting fake bills and make a mark on it right in front of you at the cash register, NEVER disappear into the back room with it.  This is so highly suspect it's unbelievable.  I think you got ripped off.

For example, I cannot own a Squad Automatic Rifle. Liberty is freedom, and I don't have the freedom to own that particular type of weapon. Some could even argue this is unconstitutional.<br>  <br>  There are also freedoms that cause damage. For example, the media(certain parts of it) has caused lots of damage to certain people. Octomom for example(I'm not going to debate whether or not she deserved it, or was right to have 8 kids after 6) has gotten death threats and been harassed. Also, many people have committed suicide over words. And I'm also pretty sure I could get a parent in a lot of trouble if I started cussing in front of their kid.<br>  <br>  A cost/benefit analysis is necessary for each one. <br>  <br>  I can't own a SAW because the only purpose would be for entertainment, while it would make it much easier for people to get their hands on them who have ill will. <br>  <br>  Freedom of speech causes lots of trouble, but it is a necessary freedom. People are used to it, and would revolt if it was taken.
rxMHRbTzaa	Judging by some of the other answers to this question I believe a lot of people misnderstand what you are asking here. I think what you are asking about is the fact that a former Army soldier who leaves the Army (or Airforce or Navy) joins the Marines and must graduate from Marine Boot camp to earn the title of Marine. However, if a Marine leaves the Marine Corps and then joins the Army he does not have to go to Army Basic training. His Marine Bootcamp covers that. I have actually did this. I was in the Marines, got out with an Honorable discharge and joined the Army National Guard without having to attend any formal Army training. I did not ask why, I was just happy I did not have to waste my time at Army Basic. Im not really sure why it is like that other than Marine Boot Camp iis much more intense and comprehensive than Army Basic training. And I can tell you from the point of view of someone who has served in the Marines and the Army that the Army loves to have Marines join. We bring a sense of discipline to the Army that is just not very common among soldiers.|`|dSbAz63baa	Soldiers have to attend USMC boot camp because the Army doesn't teach us how to parade on a deck. The drill ceromony Marines perform is not easy. It takes plenty of practice and detail. <br>  <br>  Marines going Army still have to go through AIT.<br>  <br>  Far as anything reffering to infantry or weapons - There's a huge difference between a "rifleman and a "Infantryman"|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Because the Marine Corps teaches a basic level of infantry skills to everyone at Boot, <br>  <br>  That the Army does not teach to those who are not combat arms.<br>  <br>  So a clerk coming from the Army, needs those skills.<br>  <br>  Also, it is done for espirt de corps reasons<br>  <br>  It hasn't always been that case though.<br>  <br>  You see alot of people, try and say, that it means the Marines are better than the other services.<br>  <br>  But if the Air Force required all former Marines to go thru Air Force basic, would you say that means the AF is better ? Of course not.<br>  <br>  t<br>  Tradition plays an important role in the marine Corps, more so than in the other services.<br>  <br>  Who cares about weapon qualification badges.<br>  <br>  Every service besides the AF, gives people good conduct medals for not getting an article 15 for 3 years straight, who cares ?<br>  <br>  The AF doesn't even have a good Conduct medal anymore, does that make them better somehow ?|`|C7wjR42Daa	All prior service must pass USMC boot camp in order to be Marines if they decide to enlist into the USMC.<br>  <br>  Any Marine does not have to attend Army basic if he/she enters the army. <br>  <br>  Yes, I guess the USMC is over rated.<br>  <br>  And NO, Marines do not get an award for doing something as simple as tossing a grenade in boot camp. That is silly.|`|2sPWYf5Paa	Army members attend their own basic training. You will never see a soldier at a USMC boot camp. After basic training you may see joint services training together, depending on the job they are training for. I don't believe the Marines get awarded a grenade badge. (Shot across the bow) "If you wear that badge you are a fag!"|`|dSHLl6Wbaa	why would the army give awards for tossing a grenade? do they really do that? what else do you get awards for..perhaps if you pass basic you get an award..who knows..the rope and beret killed it for me..|`|9DHWNGeeaa	What?<br>  <br>  Soldiers go to their own basic training and Marines go to their own.<br>  <br>  Now if a Marine wants to do something else, they are usually trained by the Army, in Army facilities with Army instructors.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I like how people are voting me down. It must either be ignorant people that have no idea what the Marine Corps is like or Walts who pretend they were in the Marine Corps and is defending it.<br>  <br>  Do you know where Force Recon and Recon get their training? Schools such as SERE and Jump, all Army.

The supreme court has the athourity over all courts in the nation, they can over rule any case and so it could take years on something like civil rights or days on something like the O.J.

AA12109395	Prerequisites for a restraining order vary by state statute, however most are linked by a common language, (violence or threat of violence). Unless and until your old flame crosses that threshold, the police will be limited as to what they can do, over and above just talking to the guy.(normally that's enough unless he has serious problems). But still, you need to document your case, each and every time you feel that his contact was more than just coincidence and over time it will be clear to all that you have a legit case. I would suggest you refrain from any conversation with this fellow at all, but if you feel you must, make it short, impersonal, stress that you are happily married,  and let him know that his actions are making you uncomfortable. If that doesn't get through, inform him you have notified authorities because of your concerns.<br>  <br>  Judges want to see clear and convincing evidence(proof) before they will sign such an order. Document, document, document and if he persists, you'll get your restraining order or if he does something really stupid, maybe an arrest.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	Unless you actually have PROOF that he's been following you or harassing you / tracking you through other means, IMHO you don't have a case for a restraining order just yet, but you're close. <br>  <br>  Has your school escort actually saw him and can testify to that effect, multiple times? That may help your case. <br>  <br>  Looking you up on Facebook or classmate or whatever public means is hardly illegal. And unless you can prove it is him (you said you got a contact attempt? Did he identify himself?)  Some websites use fake "X people looked you up!" notices to drive traffic to itself, so unless you can prove the e-mail came from him, or the contact attempt is from him, that doesn't prove anything. <br>  <br>  Did you actually come right out and tell him that you are married happily with a child, and tell him to stop contacting you? If you never did, then it's time that you do. Obviously, do this in a public place. <br>  <br>  You can report this to the police, and maybe the police may pay him a visit, just for investigational purposes, but that's up to the officers.|`|sMbIzXbUaa	Alert the police as soon as possible. Stalking needs to be taken VERY seriously. All threats must be considered legitimate. EVEN IF HE SAYS HE IS JOKING. Stalkers who make threats actually DO harm/kill people eventually.  Make note of all incidents. Write down the date, time, and place where the incident occurred. Have someone else videotape him outside your classes if he shows up. Video show it to the police immediately.|`|1JnS7nNkaa	In California you can go directly to the police or Sheriff's office, fill out some forms, pay a fee and get a restraining order.  If you need more detailed help, contact your local women's shelter, they are pros at this sort of thing.|`|W16vRFTNaa	i think he has to threaten you first but, if it gets super creepy then tell if he he does not stop you are going to get the police involved.
nwMBfgcdaa	Depends on the circumstances, but it can be very unreliable. <br>  As an example, during class at the academy they did a demonstration.  During the lecture, another instructor chased another employee through the classroom (there were two doors, one at the front, one at the back).  He had a weapon in his hand and they both made statements.  <br>  After they left, everyone was asked to write down everything they could remember, from what was said to what they were wearing and carrying. <br>  It was amazing the huge variation of what was recalled.  And these were people studying to be Police.<br>  I have read explanations on why people are unreliable but don't have the references right now.  It basically comes down to how humans process information. <br>  Now that was a situation where they saw the people for a few seconds.  Different situations will have different results, such as a victim who spends longer time with the suspect.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	That's one of the systems dirty little secrets.  Eye witness testimony is not very accurate at all.  I was able to prove in high school (oh so many years ago) that a group of people who see the exact same event will have wildly divergent testimony.  Only one out of 30 testified with 100% accuracy.<br>  <br>  But a lawyer cannot challenge eye witnesses on that basis in a court.  Any who try risk not only contempt of court charges, but also a mistrial.  Courts go to great length to give the jury the illusion that eye witness testimony is factually solid.  You can attack the witness directly, but not the credibility of eye witness testimony in general.<br>  <br>  There are problems with perception, interpretation, and memory.  All add up to most people being unbelievable - even when they are sure they saw what they think they saw.|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	varies from dead on accurate to extremely iffy accurate|`|qwaWd14vaa	Eyewitness testimony, how accurate is it?<br>  A University of Washington Professor in 1973 wrote a book about eyewitness testimony. She stated that the testimony became distorted by time of event to trial date.(Some murder trials took 3 years to come to trial and a year at trial)<br>  For a detailed look at this subject, got to wikipedia and seek eyewitness testimony. Interesting.|`|e61e97ce7197ef3797fdc64f3b935342aa	In short it is VERY unreliable. It was thought infallible before Elizabeth Loftus first started her investigations into it. There are many factors that effect Eye-Witness Testimony.|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	it is considered the worst type of evidence to have because witnesses can remember things that didn't happen or they made themselves think they saw but really pieced together later.  i don't know of any study which gives an percentage on how accurate eyewitnesses are, just that fingerprints, DNA, and photos are better evidence.

PMRp2ZRlaa	The common values between young Turks and young Americans and all other countries besides those who are exposed in violent countries should be all the same... Young people in wealthy nations and developing nations that are not affected by any war had similarities, that in some ways deals with the future of the world we are facing. I know that they rely on us for the developments on peace, and other solutions that affecting the world such as the global warming, famine,war, and other miserable things going on. I believe that peace is the most common plea to all mankind. <br>  <br>  For other countries such as Gaza, and other countries affected by a long  turmoil (war). hatred builds on both sides and so are the majority of that populations ie, muslims as an example. This alone leads me to believed that young generations will carry the same ideology until this generations will matured. When hatred is build within us, young leaders will carry the same problem over and over again. One good things in common with the countries not being affected are doing the same like we are doing now (promoting peace). So it is a cycle that generations have to understand, in order to promote understanding around the world.<br>  <br>  Our leaders have to set example now (the more positive way of promoting understanding, and bringing peace together). The less problem now will be a good future for the new generations. It is possible. Our future technology brings us together as a whole. Good example are, Yahoo Q/A, Facebook, My Space, You Tube, and other programs in the internet. These can make us understand each other by simply exchanging positive ideas even the most remote places around the globe. Yes positive input and ignore those negative ones, as I always do.

7KECqP1Uaa	Mugabe was probably at arm's length if the killing was deliberate. His security services most likely were pro-active for the boss. They have some culpability anyway : why didn't Tsvangirai have a police escort ? With the MDC saying it was an accident, doubtless for self-protection, it will be treated as an accident by Mugabe's government. I'd expect a light sentence or no charge. Tsvangirai's actions speak louder than the MDC's words; he's in Botswana.

The Democrats merely put up a phony show of trying to get both parties to work together. When in fact, their version of bipartisanship is that they get everything they want, and they expect the Republicans to vote in favor of everything the Dems want. Obama played the same game, pretending to be interested in the Republicans ideas, but then when the Republicans offered their proposals to the Dems, they ALL got denied. No negotiation, no debate. Just denied. <br>  <br>  Whats more, the Democratic party re-wrote the rules of the house making it next to impossible for the Republicans to offer up ANY proposals for a vote. It would serve the Democrats right if and when the next time the Republicans capture the majority, that they leave the Dems rules in place.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The biggest difference is that Democrats try to get the parties to work together in a bi-partisan fashion while Republicans shun bipartisanship.  Bush, in his first few days in office, did all he could to polarize the nation, to throw red meat to his base.  Obama, in contrast, tried to keep the Republicans involved, tried to get their input and find compromise and consensus.  To Democrats, compromise is a victory, to Republicans, compromise is capitulation.<br>  <br>  But also, I think Bush came into office with a pre-set agenda, and every crisis and emergency that came up, he used it as a justification to pursue this agenda.  Obama is more pragmatic, more focussed on what actually needs to be done.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	Integrity, ethics, intelligence, transparency, honesty....  <br>  <br>  Bush had none of those attributes.|`|3MM64geHaa	He  is supporting the rights of people who behead their opponents.

It is a bill that Reid and Pelosi held back from Bush because he said that he would veto it. Much of this bill was written knowing whose desk it would be sent to.

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Caliber is caliber - the diameter of the barrel.<br>  <br>  Cartridges of the same caliber may come in different shapes and sizes though depending on the use.  Let's take 3 common Russian cartridges to illustrate the point.<br>  <br>  Historically 7.62mm has been a popular caliber in Russian small arms from pistols to rifles to machine guns.  But just because they are the same "caliber" doesn't mean they shoot the same stuff.<br>  <br>  The old Russian pistol cartridge is 7.62x25mm (7.62mm caliber with a case 25mm long).  <br>  <br>  The AK-47 assault rifle fires a 7.62x39mm cartridge.  The longer case holds more powder so it can shoot a longer, heavier bullet of the same caliber at higher velocity to a longer distance.  Obviously this cartridge is far too large to fire from a pistol.  It needs a larger, heavier rifle to fire it.<br>  <br>  The old Russian bolt-action battle rifles of WWI and WWII and Russian machine guns to this day use 7.62x54mm which again fires a heavier bullet at higher velocity to a longer distance because of the extra powder contained in the bigger case.|`|2zym4J9xaa	30 caliber  = 7.62 mm<br>  <br>  The (x) means "by" <br>  <br>   12 x10......... or 12 feet by 10 feet<br>  <br>  The term caliber or calibre designates the interior diameter of a tube or the exterior diameter of a wire or rod. The term most often appears with respect to firearms, as a measure of the inside diameter of the barrel in inches or in millimetres. In firearms, the caliber is the diameter of the inside of the barrel. In a rifled barrel the distance is measured between the lands.If the measurement is in inches then the caliber (abbreviated to cal) is quoted as a decimal of an inch, so a (smallbore) rifle with a diameter of 0.22 inch is a .22 cal ("twenty-two caliber"). The length of the barrel (especially for larger guns) is often quoted in calibers. Dimensions of rockets and missiles, particularly the location of the centre of pressure, are usually expressed in calibres, where one calibre is equal to the body diameter.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	You're missing a lot, but this may not be the best forum for learning it all.<br>  45 ACP bullets are indeed .451" or so in diameter, and the 50 BMG round is about .510", not that much different. But the weight of the bullets used in 50 BMG are much heavier than those in 45 ACP, so they're much longer. And that has nothing to do with case length, which is where you often get that "x something" measurement. As examples, 7x57 Mauser uses a bullet of about 7.2 mm diameter pushed down a bore of about 7mm diameter, and the case is 57 mm long; and the 8x57 comes in two bullet diameters, .318" and .323", designated in part as 8x57 I and 8x57 IS. Note that none of these is often an exact measurement, either. It's a complicated subject, with as many exceptions as there are rules in nomenclature.

AnfbrZFuaa	I agree somewhat. What you've got to understand is that people aren't necessarily ungrateful. They believe that lives are being wasted because they don't understand why we are fighting that war. The ones in Vietnam were hippies who would oppose a boxing match. But with Iraq, people think that we are now in there for no reason. So to hide the fact that they don't know, they make up BS statistics to make people turn against the war. Right now, the reason we're in Iraq, is to help them get a functional democracy going. Most people believe that they can do it themselves, but if we pull out, another dictator is gonna take over. But they don't understand that. <br>  <br>  Another thing that they do, is over exaggerate. They make the war sound like we are losing a terrible amount of people. But they are trying to sway naive people to go against the war. For example, in WWII, we lost more men in one battle, then we've lost in both wars in Iraq combined. But the American people believed in that war. It's all a matter of peoples perspective on the war. I don't think any American who is proud of their country would honor every last man that died fighting for our independence. There have been very few wars we've fought that were in fact pointless.<br>  <br>  Avail and 2QT have the distinct scent of bull ****.<br>   War is the final, and sure way to solve things. I'll quote teddy Roosevelt. "speak softly, and carry a big stick" which means if negotiations fail, beat the hell outta them. War was the only way to solve both world wars, and it's been the only way to solve every war we've been in. If negotiations worked as well as people believe they would, the U.N. would actually make a difference, other than being target practice. You can't negotiate with people like Hitler, hoshimen, bin laden, sadam Hussein, and the hesbolah. <br>  <br>  Hope this clarifies that.<br>  XD|`|75358d4fb890522547a8f3145f0b6fbeaa	No, America as a whole is not hypocritical.<br>  <br>  But some people in America are hypocritical, as are people in every nation.<br>  <br>  And many Americans do still respect and honor the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform, past and present.|`|AbHm1BBXaa	I'm not sure how you get that idea.<br>  But it sounds like you are well on your way to believing every drop of crap-talk that comes out of a  right-winger's mouth.<br>  <br>  If a dare-devil stunt man gets killed doing a stunt and someone thinks they died needlessly, does that mean his life meant nothing?<br>  No it means that they lost their life doing something that didn't NEED to be done.<br>  <br>  I can give you thousands of more examples that are similar, where the same thing is said but the person isn't saying that the sacrifice was worthless. there is always something to learn from every event that makes the sacrifice have its own value even though the event that the sacrifice was made in, wasn't necessary.<br>  <br>  The people who view the lives of the people as worthless, are the people who sent them into harms way for their own personal agenda.<br>  <br>  BTW how was someone fighting for our freedom in Vietnam?<br>  <br>  You're only 16 so we'll forgive your complete lack of logic.|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	I don't see the the connection between the Revolutionary War (which was fought so we could have our independence from England) and the invasion of Iraq.|`|W0VL46gDaa	yes, many people are Very ungrateful.<br>  <br>  Obviously America as A Whole isnt.. but many people are..

Can't tell ya, I'd have to kill ya ;)|`|13fd9e092e75699e89f377198401f8d4aa	Can't really say the details, it's confidential.<br>  <br>  Battle Stations is the culminating event for Navy boot camp. It starts at 10 p.m. with a call to general quarters and lasts until 9:30 the next morning. During this time, recruits must overcome 12 highly realistic crisis simulations.<br>  <br>  "No food, no sleep, constant stress," said Petty Officer 1st Class Jeff Luce, a Battle Stations facilitator. "But they have to be able to handle these situations in the fleet. The way the world is, there probably will be times when they will be on general quarters and at their battle stations. They will have to deal with this stress and still get their jobs done."<br>  <br>  Each event is based on a historical scenario. The Shaft Alley Rescue, for example, is based on the sinking of the USS Oklahoma during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Hundreds of sailors were trapped below deck when the ship capsized and sank. Rescuers had to go in through the upended engine shafts to save survivors.<br>  <br>  Recruits in the Shaft Alley scenario had to carry a litter-bound 185-pound dummy through an obstacle course. The dummy played the role of "wounded shipmate."<br>  <br>  "What did you learn?" Luce asked the recruits following the event.<br>  <br>  "If you don't pay attention to detail, you could cause more damage to your shipmate," said one recruit.<br>  <br>  "Great. What else?"

The leader doesn't have every single answer," Luce said. <br>  <br>  "Your shipmates will come up with some pretty good ideas if you just listen.<br>  <br>  "But you did well," he continued. "You started together, you finished together. Nobody gave up. Are you ready for the next event?"<br>  <br>  "AYE, PETTY OFFICER!" the group yelled.<br>  <br>  The stress continued through the night. Recruits double-timed between stations. At each, they learned a piece of Navy history and how it affects them today. For each scenario, the facilitators chose a new group leader.

The work pace can get hectic like when you are near any war zones and flight operations are taking place night and day. With not much to do besides work you can get caught up in working even longer hours to pass the time. But it is really great when you pull into some fine ports overseas. I made 7 cruises to the western Pacific area and enjoyed immensely places like Australia (any city), Japan, Korea, Thailand, New Zealand, Tasmania and Subic Bay, Philippines (when we still had a base there. A carrier usually has a weight room to work out in and burn off some tension, a ship's store with some nice items to purchase (CD's, DVD's, snacks, and ships's souveniers, etc.), the food is usually fairly good and served in 4 different times as the ship never fully sleeps. Put in the long hours of hard work and you will feel the great feeling of contributing to the overall goal of the ship's missions and then enjoy visiting some nice overseas places and experiencing some things many will never see. And in your spare time at sea you can always take some college courses (yes, we have some civilian teachers along that are contracted with the Navy to teach some limited courses), play some cards or board games with your buddies, watch TV (there is closed circuit TV piped throughout the ship with some, relatively, new shows and movies), play some video games, catch up on a good book (there is a library), or many other forms of relaxation. And don't forget to write home and share your experiences with family and friends. <br>  <br>  Good luck, shipmate!|`|oSHCPmiqaa	Its like living in a city in the middle of the ocean. You have to walk up and down ladderwells and all across the ship. it gets really tiring.<br>  <br>  I forgot to tell you. you might get claustophobic when sleeping in the racks during the first few weeks then you get used to it. They call out man overboard drills when departing to make sure everybody is on board and have General Quarters which is to practice fighting a ship fire because it does happen. oh, one more thing, watch out for nasty people in berthing. some doesnt like to shower.<br>  <br>  one more thing, during port, the ship has duty sections to keep the ship active 24 hours a day. so if you happen to get duty, it starts around 0730-0730 the next morning. the hours vary depending on the weekend and weekdays.

And make sure you let us know what happens!<br>  ~HUG~<br>  :)
TkQZtNjyaa	I don't get Republicans. They are beyond retarded. They claim they don't want to the govt to protect the populations health yet it's the govts job to bomb other countries just in case those countries decide to attack us? What about direct threats like disease?<br>  <br>  Republicans only care about protecting Americans as long as they get to murder a brown person in the process. Otherwise, they have no problem letting poor people die of curable diseases. I've always wondered how Republicans claim to be patriotic while not giving a **** about their fellow Americans. From what I've seen, Republicans are the most unpatriotic people in the country.|`|1WnufoUmaa	Universal healthcare is not the solution for our current problems with healthcare. I want the government to butt out of my life, not to take over more of it. The government obviously has issues running itself. Furthermore, Obama is not calling for Universal healthcare, more like the option of having a government insurance.<br>  I think that we need to remove health insurance companies from our basic medical decisions. There are some doctors that actually refuse to accept health insurance and it keeps their overhead lower so they can offer more affordable care to people, especially the working class. I have had health insurance (a couple of different ones) and have gone without. I opt out of health insurance because it costs more than I would pay out of pocket a year. Yes, there is always that chance that something big may happen. I also don't like insurance companies making my doctors or my medical decisions. You won't believe the hassle I got just for going to a chiropractor. <br>  This issue isn't so simple to fix, nothing really is anymore. It will take some time and a lot of people educating themselves to help figure it out.|`|cb1d5eb8ef6d45defc8e354f3870d037aa	Very illogical and backwards, group health insurance is another incentive to hire employees like 401k or other programs.

I pay about twenty percent of the cost with my deduction.  We have to look at the insurance companies and hospital administrations who are making a killing out of health-care.

While Obama is having $100/lb. steak dinners and having his own Earth Wind and Fire concerts, Americans are struggling.  He has done very little except allow Pelosi to write the most expensive piece of legislation in our history and travel around the country as though he's campaigning for 2012.

He is ruining the future of our children and grandchildren with his ridiculous debt. When he finishes redistributing wealth and there are no more rich people to fund his atrocious spending, what do you think he is going to do next.   The economy soared during Bush. After the Dems took over it tanked. It tanked bc of the housing market and credit crisis that O had a hand in.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bank of,  Maddoff was no republican and many of his victims are as liberal as they come.

He is smart, competent, hard working but still wouldn't be able to make this mess so quickly.<br>  <br>  Bush thought the answer to everything was to deregulate, cut taxes for the wealthy, and ignore problems with the economy- the free market would fix it.  <br>  <br>  The issues with the banks did not happen overnight.  Financial institutions were allowed to do things they had be prohibited form doing before.  This relaxing of the rules made it extremely profitable to get into the sub prime mortgage market because the money was made by dumping these mortgages into securities that were bundled and sold.  To make things worse many of these mortgages were set up with huge balloon payment or were interest only so the principal was never paid down.  And people were encouraged to pull equity out and refinance.  It was bound to fail eventually.  This was no surprise.  It was well known for at least a few years that this was coming but nothing was done.<br>  <br>  Bush sat on his *** and now the Republicans have the nerve to blame Obama.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	Aren't they being just sooo silly.  <br>  <br>  However, Obama's seemed turnabout regarding the Attorney General's investigation of Bush and his administration has me fuming.|`|2bx5l56caa	The poor things have a terrible memory, theyre all the sudden blaming Obama for trying to help.|`|kiyVz23Jaa	First of all, I did not expect him to fix things 7 weeks. I also did not expect him to makes things worse in 7 weeks either which he has done. And working his butt off? A few weeks after the election he already took a "vacation". And it wasn't all Bush. Things have to get passed from congress, the house and the senate. And it wasn't the past 8 years, it was about the past 3 or 4. And what happened around that time? Democrats took majority in the house and senate. Hmmm...coincidence? I think not.<br>  <br>  And I do work hard! I have two jobs right now and my tax money is going towards a basketball court, and a tennis court, oh and don't forget the frisbee field. Explain to me how this is stimulating the economy?<br>  <br>  Back when the great depression happened, FDR did not get us out of the mess. The war did. FDR prolonged the depression by 10 years!!! You cannot fix this type of downward economy by spending. It has been proven to fail over and over and over again.<br>  <br>  So many liberal democrats love blaming the other party for everthing. They can't take anything upon themselves. And when they have no further agruement they change the subject or divert the attention to someone else.

We all made the mess.  Because America has become a greedy and selfish country.  We need her back the way she was.|`|Jq5WK8caaa	Well we where yelling at him too, do the research, Bush was a very liberal Republican.  He over spent just the same.  Although I am impressed by President Obama, he has signed more spending in the past 6 weeks then President Bush had done in 8 years.  We conservatives dislike any gross government spending.  It is not there money to spend so freely.  If this spending continues it won't be just the rich paying higher taxes.  It will be the entire nation and in 8 years many governmental programs will disappear due to lack of budgeting.  President Obama 2010 spending bill does not extend the Bush tax cuts, meaning that anyone making over 250,000 will be paying 45% tax rate, all you hard working common will see your taxes go up too.<br>  What is even sadder is that 13 dollars a week you are not paying in taxes due to Obama "tax decrease" isn't a tax cut, you will owe that money at the end of the decreasing any Income tax return.  It will be the same as next year too, the 8 dollars a week is a tax cut its a tax deferment.  I really wish people would read these things before getting excited.  You save at least a 100 dollars a month in taxes.  This will be taken out again and you will see less of your money.  Your money will be taken from you and spent on improving the lively hoods of those who don't work hard at all.  This is why we are against all this spending, Republicans are scared because if they don't stand up to this, conservatives will stop supporting the republican party and form our own party.  That would leave the likes of Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh leading the conservative movement due to there street cred.  President Obama hasn't been working either, he has been campaigning, do you know how much it cost to fly Air Force 1, it has about a 10 thousand gallon fuel tank and always fly's on a full tank.  Not to mention escort fighters and the plane dumps all excess fuel when it lands.  This is a huge waste.  He last two spending bills had over 18000 ear marks for special pet projects and special interest groups that had lobbied.  I have not lost any money in the stock market, why??? because I read both the stimulus bills and the spending bills, guess which companies stocks are doing good, the ones who lobby the most.  <br>  The only change we have here is that you earn a 100 dollars and the government instead of taking 10 dollars, they take 25 dollars.  Yes taxes will go up to pay for everything. Rich people just might move out of this country if we continue to tax them like this.  Businesses will literally go overseas leaving us with nothing.
LT7IwZdhaa	Imagine the Costs saved in the Auto Industry, for one example, if the Government provided the Cost of Healthcare (like Canada and all of Europe). Healthcare has become the number one issue in Labor Conracts. Currently one third of all Healthcare costs go to Insurance/HMO/Pharamacuetical Profits, Administration, Advertising & Marketing.<br>  <br>  The answer is so simple. <br>  The most popular model around the Democratic World is Single Payer Healthcare where government provides the cost of delivery of either public or private healthcare. The fact that this is the most popular delivery system here in the United States is kept hidden by both the Corporate media and the Politicians who are funded by the Health Insurance Companies and Pharmacuetical Corporations.|`|9zTbeTshaa	A lot of employers don't supply health insurance.  It is a fringe benefit that some companies offer to get quality workers to apply for a position with them, plus it is much cheaper for the business to get a group insured than for a single person to get coverage.<br>  By the way, we can get our own, just like auto insurance, but it is A LOT more expensive buying it on your own.  A lot of companies don't pay their help enough to purchase insurance on their own.|`|ebd0189efd63c93e058ddd9c6850db5faa	Because tort law has created an environment that makes health insurance oppressively expensive to buy without group discounts.

The federal government put a freeze on wages.  Employers started using benefits packages, like paid up health insurance, to attract new workers.  After a few employers started it, most followed suit.<br>  <br>  I agree, employers should pay wages to employees and that is it.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	it is away for them to control people. To keep them working for them. I imagine they can find out some personal things also.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	This was largely a result of wage freezes during WWII<br>  <br>  Because companies could not raise wages to attract workers they sweetened the benefit packages by adding health insurance.  After the war it became more and more an expected benefit offered by the employer.<br>  <br>  The crazy thing is that this is yet another example of government interference in the market having unexpected harmful effects.  Wage controls led to health insurance, health insurance led to health cost inflation, health cost inflation is leading to government provided health care.  All of it could have been avoided by not freezing wages in the first place and letting the market decide how much a worker got paid.<br>  <br>  It is available like auto insurance.  There are lots of companies working in the individual and small group market catering to small business owners.|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	It's an absurd system that was put in place after WWII.  Because of wage controls, employers competed for workers by offering health insurance as a fringe benefit.  So now we have a system where the loss of a job is compounded by the loss of health care.  I agree that one's employer should not be responsible for the costs of health care as it puts American businesses at a huge competitive disadvantage.  I'm not so sure, however, that buying on the open market, a la auto insurance is a good idea.  Those insurance companies are already fairly corrupt and attempt to deny payments to people - I had this experience in an auto accident when a drunk driver hit and ran me...not my fault - the driver who hit me was convicted of a federal offense, yet my auto insurance made getting care (for broken nose, torn ligament in knee and lower back problems) and reimbursement very difficult.  We need national health care - it is too vital and important to be left to the open market.<br>  <br>  edit:  My cell bill is FAR below 250 a month...it's like 60 bucks a month.|`|3MM64geHaa	It was a benefit offered voluntarily by employers. They can get it a reduced rate due to buying the policies in bulk. Then it became expected.  Now people don't want to pay for any of their coverage or health care costs.|`|4fqaQRnIaa	As an added benefit.<br>  <br>  Group coverage is cheaper so you can get more bang for your buck.<br>  <br>  It has a higher value because the coverage costs are usually shared by the business.

9p6EnV2caa	Some Americans "blather" about foreign aid because America gives a lot of foreign aid.  We do not take foreign aid.  We do sell Treasury bonds, which other nations are happy to buy because they know that their money is invested well.  There is no better investment.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Just how is everything the US spends money on, coming from the Chinese ?<br>  <br>  You would think the China would own trillions and trillions of US Treasury Bonds if all our spending was made from borrowing from China.<br>  <br>  Instead of China just owning 680 billion in US treasury Bonds<br>  <br>  Just 430 billion more than they did in 2001|`|jeYL4S5Zaa	First of all we are #1 in donations. I don't know where you got #14 but that is way off.<br>  <br>  Second we are not receiving foreign aid from China. AID = Free money when in need. China is not donating to the American cause. China is investing into our country. They do not do this without payback. <br>  <br>  <br>  Nice nickname. based on your question and your handle you must be anti-American. Instead of sitting here complaining you should move to Canada or something. Best part of being American is that you can leave when ever you want. <br>  <br>  Please do your research before you make statements like that.|`|IgaW4g8Naa	"kindness?"  lol  the whole cycle needs to be broken including "kind asians" giving us our daily bread.|`|LNatMloraa	"#14 on the list"<br>  <br>   pull your head from your @ss and you will see we are #1 on that list

I want to see a Rush Limbaugh. that man literally moved from side to side so much that when he was on CNN on a split screen he almost was going out the sides of the screen on each side. The uneducated things he says should brought to light the way a comedian can do. Then a skit with Kenneth the page & Jindal & of course we have to show Steele but the public still has no idea what a mess he is yet.

I remembered after the election they laughed at her for saying they lost because of the economy and that their ticket represented too much of the status quo. Months later (and even to this day), you hear a lot of the intellects and political analyst say the Republicans lost because the economy was tanking, the people wanted to see the country go in a different direction, and the Republican ticket meant "the same old Bush policies."  <br>  <br>  Also, about the stimulus package.  They're laughing at her for taking the money. She never said she was going to refuse it. She said that the stimulus package was INDEED needed BUT it wasn't the right one presented to him. Obama who had promised to do line item vetos, so he should go through it and veto the unnecessary spending.  She also said that if Obama was uncertain then to veto the whole thing until one was presented to him that didn't contain too much pork.<br>  <br>  If you actually listen to Jindal, you'll notice that he mentioned about the volcano and calling it unnecessary spending (and the libs attack him for that).  It is "unnecessary" in the context of an emergency "stimulus," but in a general sense it would be nice to have.  Do you think we should borrow emergency money from China during this economic crisis to fund volcano monitoring programs?<br>  <br>  I have been a Democrat all my life.  Now I just want to be an Independent after hearing/reading how snarky they are.  I will vote for whomever has a record of delivering what they promise regardless of party affiliation.  So far, Palin is on top, with Jindal in a close 2nd.|`|XxUByikJaa	Yes in Every Way.<br>  Republicans say they put country first -Yet Voted for Sarah Palin who has close ties to the Alaska Independent Party that wants to secede from the Unite States Of America .<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Alaskan Independence Party - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  <br>      * History|<br>      * Registered...|<br>      * Todd Palin...|<br>      * 2006 ballot...<br>  <br>  The Alaskan Independence Party is a political party in the U.S. state of Alaska that advocates an in-state referendum which includes the option of Alaska becoming an independent nation.

Everything that's revealed about Obama Christ now, after he's conned gullible idiots into electing him, confirms that Obama is nothing but a public-relations construct, a one-dimensional cardboard cut-out, an incompetent empty suit.<br>  <br>  Besides his innate inexperience and resulting incompetence, Obama's biggest threat is as figurehead, front man and rubber stamp for extremist socialist agenda of the other Dumocrats in Congress, scheming to socialize America.|`|KTNqah9eaa	I'm just puzzled as to what this is all about.

They are trained professionals in this country.

"<br>  Brian something "President Obama and the economy had another tough week ..."<br>  Brian Something "... president Obama's plan"<br>  <br>  And from the O'Reilly Factor's transcripts.<br>  O'Reilly said in his talking points memo on Thursday "President Obama's approval rating is holding firm at 63%"<br>  Wednesday O'Reilly siad "President Obama pledged to end earmarks in federal spending..."<br>  AND "President Obama would sign the bill"<br>  AND 3 more times in the show that night! <br>  On Tuesday he called him "President Obama" 5 times.<br>  <br>  I didn't count all the times they called him "the predident."<br>  <br>  Just like one person said, They usually start with "President Obama" then for the rest of the story, they say "Mr Obama" or "the president."  Same thing as when Clinton was presidnet.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	they are immature but they can call him Sadam Hussein & he would still be the great man he is, so it doesn't matter. They try to get to people don't let them look at how great he is.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	All news outlets and reporters do this, not just Fox.<br>  <br>  Basically, after they first mention "President Obama" in a story, they call him Obama or Mr. Obama for the rest of it. <br>  <br>  They did that with Bush, Clinton, Bush, Reagan, etc...<br>  <br>  Don't imagine slights where none exist.|`|HI0oQriqaa	he's not my president . i am ashamed of him and more ashamed of the uneducated people who got led into voting for a liar by the media.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	Agree with the first poster.

Why did CNN, ABC, and CBS always call bust George Bush?|`|gWX21Jtwaa	Think back to Mr Bush.<br>  <br>  Does that help.|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Probably because they don't see him as worthy of the position he holds, and rightfully so, I don't address him as president Obama, nor do I have the slightest bit of respect for him. This man supports murdering innocent babies, and should one of those babies being murdered survive, he also has voted to deny them medical treatment to revive them , that's not a president, that's a monster, and I will not support such a man, if you even want to call him a man, from my point of view he doesn't even qualify as a man much less a president . God bless.|`|f1vLaSv1aa	Cheats, crooks, tax evaders, and other low life started this mess…we tried to bail them out so they can cheat us again.

So we are stuck with a clueless President, a bunch of tax cheats, a bunch of earmarks. <br>  <br>  I don’t think we have a choice but let it fall and see when the crashing is done if there are pieces left to pick-up.<br>  <br>  <br>  one of those dem congressmen already has filed that bill proposal to eliminate term limits for the prez.  time should be limots for all congress just 2 terms..so they are not ruining america faster enought|`|FyszvGyWaa	OH GIVE IT UP!

When he does something to earn the respect of being a President, then maybe we all will call him something other than Obama.|`|9kx7KDFLaa	Yes the day shows do respect him as president but the night <br>  shows always say Obama for some reason they just dislike <br>  him .I really would not want to live that kind of life going around <br>  hating|`|ubrOdZqMaa	Why is MSNBC such  a bunch of giggling fools?

800607246df3ce3c65b01624978cb3dcaa	I am in UK and we benefit greatly from the National Health Service. I was in the States recently and spoke to an epileptic woman. She had been undergoing a long course of tests and treatment and the cost of it blew my mind. How the hell do people afford to pay medical bills that run into hundreds of thousands of dollars? What if you just don't have the money? Do they just watch you die???<br>  A portion of my income tax goes directly to fund social healthcare for everyone in the UK and this means that any time I need medical treatment I can go to my doctor or go to Accident and Emergency at the local hospital and *know* that I will be treated. It doesn't matter if I've just blown my savings on a new car or if it is the week before I get paid. I don't have to worry about finding the money for insurance premiums. The service is just there for me any time I need it. (Luckily not very often at the moment!) <br>  I watched Sicko by Michael Moore recently and I understand the reluctance the US has towards social healthcare, but some of the stories, e.g. 75 year old guys working two jobs to pay for their elderly wife's medicine, are just heartbreaking. And the stories of the healthcare companies who refuse to pay out legitimate claims - that's criminal. There has to be a better way.<br>  So, to answer the points you've raised:<br>  (1) The Government does no such thing. Every newly-qualified doctor has the choice of going into private practice or working for the NHS. Most seem to choose the NHS as steady work is guaranteed and it is a good way of gaining experience. NHS doctors, especially General Practitioners (family doctors) are pretty well paid, all things considered. They are able to apply for jobs with any practice as vacancies arise - just like any other job. There are 20 or more GP's practices in my area (3-10 docs per practice) and I am able to register with any one I like the look of. I can change my doctor easily and for no given reason and my medical notes (which are held centrally so I can get treatment anywhere in emergencies) are just transferred across to the new doctor. <br>  The government does have some say in which treatments are offered. This is important, though, as public money is being spent on providing them. For example, the majority of plastic surgery will have to be paid for privately - why should the taxpayer fund bigger boobs! IVF is only offered a certain number of times (I think it's two) as the chances of conceiving drop on each further attempt. Also, some drugs are not provided if it cannot be proved that they have any decent chance of working, or if they cost excessive money for little chance of success. <br>  The body that decides what will be offered on the NHS is called the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and they are reviewing new treatments all the time to assess how likely they are to succeed. You can therefore be certain that you will get a treatment that is appropriate for you not just the latest 'trendy' medication from the sales rep with the best lines. Value-for-money is all-important, and means that the NHS actually provides a pretty high quality of care.<br>  (2) Us Brits often complain about the NHS and how rubbish it is, but that is because we are spoilt. We have a safety net which will catch us in whatever situation we find ourselves in and we have stopped appreciating it. The NHS isn't perfect and they are sometimes slow to adopt new procedures and treatments. They do have staffing shortages and at certain levels it has become rather bogged-down in bureaucracy (like every govt department). The fact remains that there is no law against private healthcare and everyone has the right to pay privately for more advanced treatment if they feel it will help them faster or more effectively. However, for the old, the chronically ill, and the desperate, the NHS is literally a life-line. <br>  I didn't realise I'd written so much, so I'm sorry if I've bored you. I hope you find something of use in what I have written.|`|twdXT5wOaa	The British system is a State service, like the fire brigade or police.  My experience, both as a service user and a former employee, is that it works superbly well, despite being top heavy with overpaid senior management, and short on investment.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, don't believe those who say you cannot choose your doctor, or dentist, in Britain.  It's a politically motivated lie.  You can also choose your hospital for non-emergency treatment.<br>  <br>  I have also lived in France, which has an insurance based system, and is not as comprehensive as the British NHS,  because vulnerable people are partly excluded if they can't afford supplementary insurance - and even then, the social security contributions are much higher than in Britain.  For people with that insurance, it works as well as the British system.  For the excluded, it does not. At best, it's a service as good as the NHS, but much, much more expensive.<br>  <br>  Be very careful of insurance based systems.  Go for a State service, I say!|`|FdZtCnwhaa	It would be best to ask these in the international answers from the respective country and then link them back to here while asking about social health care ;)|`|fyhl3TQgaa	I don't think I've ever met an incompetent Doctor, most Doctors are competent, and as far as a Doctor being assigned to me, I'd rather be assigned a doctor, than go through the the rigmarole of looking at the histories of many Doctors' medical capabilities. <br>  <br>  I'll leave you with an absolute statement that defends socialised health care, and one that criticises it, 'no society can legitimately call itself civilised if a sick person is denied medical aid because of lack of means' (Bevan), and its juxtapose 'It is an enduring eccentricity of the British that we regard our National Health Service as the envy of the world, despite the evidence staring us in the face of slum hospitals staffed by surly trade unionists (the doctors surliest of all) and run by vast legions of bureaucrats accountable to nobody, least of all the customers' (Jonathan Miller).

Jq5WK8caaa	She is fund dipping, just like NC residents pay the highest gas tax .68 cents.  The sad fact of reality is that laws need to be enacted to protect American tax payers dollars from fund dipping.  Most of the money collected from these programs such as the gas tax, the lottery and other such taxes, only half makes it to the desired location.  This is taxation without explanation.|`|AA10264674	they can tell lies because the democrats have the liberal bias media on their side........kinda like sadams old newspaper or tv...they wouldn`t dare say a bad thing about him......NC residents deserve better....|`|1FkYHLXDaa	She is a Democrat.

They are listening to him for political survival.  As well as they are listening to Sean Hannity and The heritage foundation.  What you forgot to add in, is why conservative Democrats are starting to listen to Rush as well?  Blue dog democrats are falling in line with there Republican counter parts.  The bipartisanship appears to be on the opposition to President Obama, Nancy Polisi and Harry Reid policy and governess.  The numbers are growing and its forcing Obama to use aggressive legal loop hols to avoid the senate.  But it will soon over take the house as well.  Say bye bye to the party of unity and hello to the conservative movement.|`|Irjopfpvaa	Republicans used to be the pioneer of change.

We'll call Keith Overbite and Chris Matthews the liberal leaders.....since the logic is that any news/radio personality are now leaders.<br>  <br>  Sounds fair.|`|qRuXJI2jaa	What about Dems kowtowing to the Libs in Hollywood.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	it appears democrats have sheep and republicians goats|`|1FkYHLXDaa	This question is far too deep for me to answer.|`|AA10138269	Frozen Fear|`|wIIM4yT7aa	People....... think about it. Rush has been around for a long time touting the Conservative philosophy.... and has been doing it pretty darn well.  Libs are jealous of that.  Which brings me to Newt, who I feel will make a run for the Presidency.  This will keep the MSM occupied while the Conservative Repubs re-group and get back to the principles of Gov't for the people, by the people and to serve the people. Newt is someone that reminds me of a Reagan style individual.... able to ge his point across that all can understand and is able to rebutt the MSM.|`|hXwqKidraa	Dunno. I am really concerned about the lack of leadership from the president. So far his performance is less than adequate. I'm also concerned about the number of tax cheats and lobbyists he has appointed. And that poor bungling fool, Robert Gibbs. I wonder how long he is going to last.  Is there any chance that Obama and his buddies in Congress can turn this economy around? I don't think so, and neither do investors. Can you shed any light on that? How will this massive spending actually help? Any thoughts on some real issues? Or would you prefer to chat about a freakin talk show host!?!?<br>  <br>  This isn't change we can believe in.|`|ubrOdZqMaa	Boy he has the left scared! I love it!

o9dMd2rBaa	It's easier if you went Army Reserve over Army National Guard unless you know 100% sure the state you will be an engineer at is the place you want to live at. If you were in the Indiana National Guard and wanted to go to the MN National Guard, you might have a hard time doing so. It is possible to transfer, but the Indiana National Guard is going to want to hang on to you if they are the ones paying for all of your training. Army Reserve doesn't have a problem since its all Federal Money, so if you wanted to move from California to Texas or w/e, it's a lot easier.<br>  <br>  As for your original questions, yes you can easily live a normal civilian life, that's why it's called the reserve component of the Army (Army Reserve and National Guard). However it is still the military. So if your united got active to go active duty, you would have to leave behind your civilian job temporarily. I think it is illegal for your employer to fire you if you do get activated, so your job will be waiting for you when you return

AA12145054	That would be PAT testing:<br>  PA testing or portable appliance testing is an important part of any health & safety policy. <br>  <br>  This is intended as a guide to both the legal implications and to the technical requirements.<br>  <br>  The Health & Safety Executive states that 25% of all reportable electrical accidents involve portable appliances. The Electricity at Work Regulations place a legal responsibility on employers, employees and self-employed persons to comply with the provisions of the regulations and take reasonably practicable steps to ensure that no danger results from the use of such equipment. This in effect requires the implementation of a systematic and regular program of maintenance, inspection and testing. The Health & Safety at Work Act (1974) places such an obligation in the following circumstances:<br>  <br>      * 1. Where appliances are used by employees.<br>      * 2. Where the public may use appliances in establishments such as hospitals, schools, hotels, shops etc.<br>      * 3. Where appliances are supplied or hired.<br>      * 4. Where appliances are repaired or serviced.<br>  <br>  The level of inspection and testing required is dependant upon the risk of the appliance becoming faulty, which is in turn dependant upon the type of appliance, the nature of its use and the environment in which it is used. <br>  <br>  Not heard of PRI, unless this is an energy meter?
nDvrN6Qgaa	Personally I don't believe it would ever be allowed in the Armed Forces.  You wouldn't be able to trust a fellow soldier who was high on anything.

(Security clearance issues on my side of the plant and safety/quality issues on the 'main' side of the plant.<br>  <br>  (When the main plant went 'zero tolerance' the number of job related injuries dropped 40%, and the workmanship related quality defects dropped over 75%.  It should be obvious that the problem employees were the ones who did drugs.)|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Marijuana being legalized in the civilian world wouldn't have any effect in the military itself and the military would have to change the UCMJ to allow it.  There are certain things that are legal in the civilian world that are illegal in the military, such as committing adultery, open homosexuality, or talking back to your superiors.  If you go to Las Vegas and engage in prostitution or to Amsterdam and smoke weed you will still get punished because the UCMJ prohibits it.|`|bmsq005uaa	I served 4 years.  I am an addictions nurse now.  I am going to go out on a limb and say that the military's stance on weed is not going to change.

hB2yvOQvaa	Many people say they love their country, but truly only love their own ideals and don't care about anyone else.|`|AA10482044	Because people that work for governments get paid whatever their union agreed they were going to get paid, in many cases an awful lot for what they actually do.  There is no competition in government work except to compete for how much your pay grade can get, the work itself is usually seen as incidental.  People working hard in real jobs where they get a fraction of the profits and pay taxes on that (that go for the 'special' government workforces, local, State and Federal) do get annoyed when they haven't got enough left over for the food, rent and bills.  You'll see if you are one of the (slight majority) of them when you are working!|`|AA11702773	I love my COUNTRY.  I most certainly do not love my government's financial record.<br>  <br>  What investor in their right mind would pick someone with our government's record to manage ANY amount of money?|`|VuaOKpYXaa	All of those services you listed are local services.  I have no problem paying for them because I live across the lake from the mayor and if he overdoes it then I can sit down with him and talk it over.  This keeps him accountable.<br>  <br>  How do I hold some bureaucrat in Washington equally accountable?  This is why the system was designed to have the federal government be small and only provide services such as defense, diplomacy, and interstate trade which more local governmental units could not.<br>  <br>  I have no problem with paying higher taxes if they are necessary but government should not provide any additional services than it was intended to and it should be as localized as possible to maintain accountability to the taxpaying citizens.|`|s1LfdCdsaa	Hold on there a minute, Clyde. Slightly higher taxes? As opposed to what, NO TAXES, like the illegals and welfare mooches pay? So, you think that all we have to do is "pump" more money into the schools and hospitals, for example, and the quality will increase, eh?<br>  <br>  Let's try again. You forget that as long as we have an overload of illegals here from Mexico, Haiti and other third world nations, the quality of our schools and hospitals will suffer. English still WON'T be mastered, AS IT SHOULD BE, and the education of AMERICAN KIDS will continue to suffer, and they'll still pump out kids left and right and LEAVE US WITH THE BILL.<br>  <br>  Higher taxes? I pay MORE than my fair share, thank you, and I love my country more than the foolish liberals that put Obama in, that's for sure.<br>  <br>  Before imposing a "slightly higher" tax rate upon people who WORK for a living, how about mandating a forty hour work week from the welfare mooches desperately trying to AVOID having to get a J-O-B??|`|SWkaGJpgaa	There is no logical or rational connection between loving your country and disagreeing with higher tax rates.<br>  <br>  No country has ever taxed and spent their way to prosperity. At least some of us grasp reality.|`|3BcvcJX9aa	I agree with what you are saying, but in these times, and with the recession, who has any extra money.  We are just trying to get by right now.|`|2aLx1P6saa	Slightly higher? There are people already paying upwards of 40% of their hard earned income in taxes. America was founded on principles of hard work and freedom. I don't think there is anything Un-American about requiring your fellow citizens to pull their own weight. What you fail to realize is pumping more and more money into schools, hospitals...etc. is not making them that much better. Let the private sector take over and then you can talk about better quality.|`|RDxbbCHwaa	I do love my country, but if my hard earned money was being taken away to fund programs I didn't agree with and people who honestly don't deserve it, but are somehow entitled to it because they breathe, I wouldn't want to pay more taxes either. And the taxes the successful people pay are pretty extravagant.<br>  <br>  It is a fact that a large percentage of the population pay no income taxes at all because they don't make enough money. So they contribute nothing, but somehow deserve the benefits of other people's hard work. This is not what America was founded on.<br>  <br>  I love the America our founding fathers made. The America we're becoming scares me.|`|FyszvGyWaa	YOu mean like Obama's cabinet appointees?

You're just being used :)|`|HlTF3X3Baa	Spending by wealthy people tends to go to people who provide useful goods or services. This creates jobs for productive workers.

If one is allowed, why is the other not allowed.  <br>  <br>  For example, polygamy is illegal in all states.  If I use your argument, its just a bunch of consenting adults.  <br>  <br>  Then someone will say that why can't I marry a 16 year old.  It was legal over 100 years ago. <br>  <br>  Where do you stop the insanity?  One man.  One woman.  If you want anything other than that, I don't care but don't make an issue out of it.|`|AA11312653	In some cases, people deliberately exaggerate and cook up alarming fantasies to excite the simple minded.

But the reality is... when you start changing definitions just to suit some group, you cross a line that was previously indelible. And having crossed that line... even a little... makes it easier to cross the line more the next time. Too many people in society today want everything to be shades of gray, when sometimes they should stay black and white.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	I concur about the animal thing- however,<br>  <br>  based on your statement, you could have a father marrying a son, and a brother marrying his brother- care to rethink?|`|6AgnCKCPaa	Because the idea of a person marrying an animal is just as ridiculous and laughable as the idea of two people of the same gender marrying.  I mean come on, seriously?..|`|VOccyg7daa	That is ridiculous when all they have to do is stop at multiple wives or husbands. You can make the same argument for that too.|`|hiCSVwchaa	They make the people/animals or adults/children argument without realizing that it's nonsensical because neither animals nor children are capable of informed consent.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	Maybe because still see homosexuality as a sexual deviancy... Much like beastiality, incest and pedophilia is... <br>  <br>  <br>  And Forget War... will you tell that to the Swedish where beastiality is legal?|`|k6hicodfaa	They forget that animals can't give consent--which makes the point moot.|`|MQPJ2UaGaa	As a novice naturalist,I have never seen same sex in the animal<br>  world,is there a reason for this?|`|mYcs3VBsaa	Animals are better than people. You shouldn't really place people on the same level as animals. The birds that don't fly anymore over Auschwitz for example are on a different morality level than 90% of the worlds population.<br>  <br>  People are powerful and that doesn't make people better. Animals help other animals, people are often reluctant to do so. Yet, we have more power.<br>  <br>  It's the biggest conceived lie in the world. Animals are afraid of us because they know how evil we can be.<br>  <br>  As for gay marriage then do what you like. I'm not going to quote from a book that tells me during it's early stages "NOT" to eat meat and then suddenly changes its mind during the later stages and says "You can eat meat".|`|1oxBCtmZaa	Consenting adults should be allowed to engage in ANY private activity that harms no one else.<br>  <br>  So yes, let gays marry, but let restaurants use trans fats, let me use incandescent lightbulbs and drive an SUV, etc....<br>  <br>  And prostitution should be legal.    If your line of reasoning is "it's two consenting adults and it affects no one else" - a line of reasoning with which I agree, by the way - then it would be a contradiction to argue that prostitution should remain illegal.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Because all some people see when they look at homosexuality is deviation.  Rather than understand that it is simply how some people are, they see it as a moral lapse and think 'if they'll stoop to that, they must be capable of anything'.  Personally, I find it more offensive that people will offhandedly attribute pedophilia to homosexuals, for the same reason.<br>  <br>  I'm sure the same argument was made about interracial marriage, back when that was an issue.  Naturally, it wasn't true then, either.|`|GXxC8CIfaa	They are not making a direct correlation between gay marriage and people marrying animals....they are explaining what could happen when you remove the strict definition of marriage to an "anything goes" definition.  <br>  <br>  It may sound crazy to you but it's just another step down the road of perversion that both  homosexuality and beastiality are on.|`|BHeBSGemaa	I agree 100%. It's insulting! Comparing gay people to animals? WTF? There are many people who WANT gay marriage and are fighting for it. I don't see people out fighting for marrying animals or polygamy. So why the comparison? We draw the line at 2 consenting adults who WANT marriage!|`|4pHTkTUaaa	I think partly because a lot (not all perhaps) of people who disagree with it are coming from a religious stand point and to them it makes about as much sense morally as the other.  Not saying I feel that way, it is just a thought as to why.|`|PLgEgPv8aa	In case you haven't noticed people make the slippery slope argument because polygamists, sexual predators, and people who practice bestiality are already out in the media asking for their rights too.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Really? I've never heard a person refer to that in a debate over gay marriage. Who have you been talking to? lol<br>  <br>  Let them marry and deal with their Maker when the time comes!|`|2MfFXmNMaa	I don't know, I have some redneck cousins. I had to tell one of them "meow means meow".<br>  <br>  Edit: Joke people. Two consenting adults should be able to get married.|`|q8bJzyUaaa	yeah, i totally agree|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	It's quite simple really...<br>  <br>  When the definition of marriage is based on biological convention (male and female with different genetic profiles), there is some protection against the sometimes fickle whims of legal manipulation.<br>  <br>  When people decide that marriage is a "fundamental right" within the framework of Law, then the definition of marriage is removed from "cultural convention" and becomes the property of the most skilled lawyers.  <br>  <br>  I'm not saying that incest, bigamy and beastiality WILL suddenly become legal, but you have to be beyond naive to think that someone out there won't TRY to make it legal....and because you have set the precedent that marriage is a "right" than the Court really has no reason not to hear the case.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way.  I'm sure most of us could agree that it's ethically "wrong" for a burgular who is injured while robbing a homeowner to then sue that homeowner for damages.  But because a court did allow such a case, the die has been cast....Once an issue establishes a "legal precedent," that issue is freed from any arguments of "right vs. wrong" that we might have.  <br>  <br>  Emotionally, we all have an idea of what is "right"....but it's an everyday fact that the Courts do not take our emotions into consideration.  It doesn't matter if you say "but I'm only talking about TWO CONSENTING ADULTS...."  Even if that language is written into a new law today, it may easily be overturned at a future date because you have established the precedent that the definition of "marriage" belongs to the Courts...<br>  <br>  The law often allows and even encourages what we believe is "wrong" on an emotional level.  And our inability to understand the "why" does not exclude the fact that it happens every day.

AA12071178	Because the banking cartels own the world! Who do you think Congress, the Fed Reserve and the Treasury work for? For Wall Street of course.<br>  Who do you think creates wars? Banks, its the biggest business in the world to promote wars that cause government to increase spending, using debt and creating deficits that they must finance.<br>  Who do you think the Federal Reserve is owned by? In the books it says that the Fed is owned by the Chapter Banks, but they never tell you owns the chapters, specially the New York Fed. Of course, the Banker, including some European bankers. <br>  So basically the whole financial systems is a big scam, since the Federal Reserve 1st day (in 1917..i don't remember the exact year). Do your research on who owns the Fed, and the fractional monetary system.<br>  Basically it works like this: The government needs money to finance the budget, therefore prints Treasury Bills (which are just IOU or pieces of paper promising to pay and that pay interest on the principal), then gives them to the Fed in exchange for money. The Fed in turn creates money out of thin air and transfers the money to the Treasury. So basically the US government does not own the currency, therefore it must pay interest on it, creating huge amounts of debt over and over and over, that always needs to pay back in form of interest to the bankers.<br>  What a beautiful business if you think about it! But screwed up is that! The worse part is that nobody complains and no one does anything about ti. There are few people that openly talk against the system, such as Ron Paul, but very few.<br>  In addition, guess what the Government then does to pay the Fed back, RAISE TAXES. That's the real reason why taxes are levied, because they need to pay the corrupt banking system. Guess who designed the taxing laws, the banking system!<br>  Wonderful don't you think!<br>  The other side of the scam is the Fractional Banking system, but that's another story!|`|0Tew2jDlaa	cuz the people running our country are stupid selfish lying SOCIALISTS!!!|`|AA11702773	It is criminal.<br>  <br>  Yes, Bush is a socialist, but only spent $350 bill, the other $350 bill plus more on the way is all Obama - using the exact same 'experts' Bush did, like his treasury secretary who under Bush was the Head of the NY Fed, administering the first half of the TARP funds.<br>  <br>  It is criminal, but it isn't party specific.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	because the people have allowed the government to take their rights and to grow wayyyyyy to big.|`|jRtQTN24aa	Probably for the same reason we're paying for abortions in Africa and elsewhere.

0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	At one time I was mildly sympathetic with the Quebecois desire for independence, but now I don't see what they really hope to gain out of it. The Canadian government already goes to great length to preserve French culture and language. And while I know Quebec wants to become even more socialist, Canada is already pretty liberal as it is. It just seems to me that Quebec has more to lose then it has to gain by declaring independence, and would probably follow by a flight of capital and people from a new Quebec country. Seriously, I've spent a month in Quebec, the Quebecois should be proud of what they have now.|`|OMYd6p3gaa	A major flaw with Quebec wanting to seperate is that they want to be independent but still use money from the Canadian Federal government. They would have to save tons of money up to run their own country, and that is extremely hard to do. They would also have to create their own currency which probably wouldnt be worth much at all. The cost to set up a new independent government would be too much for Quebec to handle and it would send their economy down the drain. <br>  <br>  Also, It would seperate the Eastern part of Canada. One of the maritimes best industry is tourism, and with Canadians having a sperate country in the middle of Canada, I think it would be hard for Western Canadians to make that trip over to the East, resulting in the dwindle of the eastern economy too. The maritimes will probably feel isolated as well and shipping goods back and forth from the Eastern and Western provinces would be extremely difficult and overall Canada would be in a very confusing state. <br>  <br>  I understand that the French of canada feel like they are losing their identity, but they have to realise that if they sperate they are hurting themselves more as well as hurting the rest of canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  To ezee: <br>  <br>  Thank you for your interest in my answer, however my answers do not come from ignorance. <br>  <br>  If Quebec voted for a seperation they would want to be "cut off" from Canada. Why would Quebec still want that tie with Canada by the currency? If Quebec wants to use the Canadian dollar, it will have to be willing to subject its financial institutions to some form of mutually agreed regulatory oversight and to provide our regulatory authorities with the required information. <br>  <br>  Your comment about Italy and Belgium being seperated by France is clearly unrelevant. Last time I checked France did not have a seperate country running through the middle of it.  What I ment about the trade being more difficult was the  fact that free trade would be more difficult within the country itself. As for the maritimes being isolated, it IS true. The maritimes are one of the weaker provinces, with the dwindiling economy and most of the martimers (myself included) moving to more western provinces like BC and Alberta to find good paying work, the maritimes are definately headed for trouble if Quebec decides to seperate. A "Berlin Wall" is definately not what I ment by any of that. <br>  <br>  In general ezee, I think you are thinking if Quebec and Canada shared some sort of Union like Europe. But that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about Quebec becoming completey seperate from Canada with no ties or strings attached what-so-ever. <br>  <br>  Thanks!|`|9K7sRWjoaa	I appreciate debate on the subject, but throwing ignorance around like Nicole S needs correction.<br>  <br>  An independent Quebec, like any country, can choose to make any other currency its legal tender. Whether that's Quebec using the Canadian dollar or Canada using the US dollar, both are legitimate options. However, a country that does so is also renouncing control over important macro-economic levers (monetary policy). So the statement "they would also have to create their own currency" is just plain false.<br>  <br>  Having "east-west separation anxiety" is just as unfounded. I mean for god sakes, Italy and Belgium are separated by France without there being any problem for the free movement of people and goods between the countries. Same goes for all of the European Union. Scaring people into believing that autonomy automatically means a "Berlin wall" is erected around Quebec is just fear mongering.  <br>  <br>  Nonetheless, why mess with a good thing? I think Canada is flexible & pragmatic enough to gently migrate towards a true confederation instead of the federation it is currently, offering a gradual decentralization of powers from the central government in Ottawa towards each provincial legislature. Newfoundland, Alberta and yes, even Quebec can find satisfaction within an economically and historically united Canada but with greater control over local matters absent from federal meddling.

It hasn't been this bad globally!<br>  <br>  My concern is there has been a conscious attempt by big business to out source EVERY American manufacturing job overseas. Now, since we make nothing, it is going to be hard to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.<br>  <br>  And I know I am going to hear taxes, when some other countries have more than we do. They mostly went to 3rd world countries thanks to the "American" industry. Unfortunately there is no such thing and many things were moved overseas NOT because they were not making a good profit. They saw a way to make a massive profit, like they did here when they worked 12 year-olds in the factories for essentially nothing 7 days a week! They are greedy.

The goal of many leaders is to improve government services to the poor, instead of increasing real American jobs.  Thus, good paying jobs for the low-skilled worker are hard to find. Heck, our town McDonald's has a hiring freeze!  Let's see. Back in 1982, the steel mills all closed up in town, along with the car factories had a HUGE layoff of workers. Thousands were out of work.

Bush's second term in office, Jonathan Clarke, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, proposed the following as the "main characteristics of neoconservatism"[37]:<br>  <br>      * "a tendency to see the world in binary good/evil terms<br>      * low tolerance for diplomacy<br>      * readiness to use military force<br>      * emphasis on US unilateral action<br>      * disdain for multilateral organizations<br>      * focus on the Middle East".<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Imperialism and secrecy<br>  <br>  John McGowan, professor of humanities at the University of North Carolina, states, after an extensive review of neoconservative literature and theory, that neoconservatives are attempting to build an American Empire, seen as successor to the British Empire, its aim being to perpetuate a Pax Americana. As imperialism is largely seen as unacceptable by the American public, neoconservatives do not articulate their ideas and goals in a frank manner in public discourse. McGowan states,[59]<br>  <br>      Frank neoconservatives like Robert Kaplan and Niall Ferguson recognize that they are proposing imperialism as the alternative to liberal internationalism. Yet both Kaplan and Ferguson also understand that imperialism runs so counter to American's liberal tradition that it must... remain a foreign policy that dare not speak its name... While Ferguson, the Brit, laments that Americans cannot just openly shoulder the white man's burden, Kaplan the American, tells us that "only through stealth and anxious foresight" can the United States continue to pursue the "imperial reality [that] already dominates our foreign policy," but must be disavowed in light of "our anti-imperial traditions, and... the fact that imperialism is delegitimized in public discourse"... The Bush administration, justifying all of its actions by an appeal to "national security," has kept as many of those actions as it can secret and has scorned all limitations to executive power by other branches of government or international law.<br>  <br>  The George W. Bush administration is accused of political denialism,[60] as well as hundreds of secretive flights with ghost detainees in the extraordinary rendition program in association with the War on Terrorism.|`|4jYgEo0Uaa	i dont care what you do in your bedroom, just keep your homosexuality out of my childs classroom and quit imposing your feministic radical gay agenda in my child<br>  <br>    i also dont care about what you do to your body, but just dont murder innocent babies.  a government's job is to PROTECT rights, that I support.

He is old and probably senile.  He became so bad in his pronouncements in the last election his Democrat handlers shut him up. They buddied him up with Bill and Hillary Clinton who heaped adulation upon him.  He called his constituents red-necked hicks.  He slandered one of his constituents in the Marines by calling him a murderer without any evidence whatsoever.  <br>  <br>  And we still re-elected him. <br>  <br>   He said in a local paper after the election that no matter what he said we keep sending him back.  Who says pork is bad.  He brings in federal dollars and we don't apparently care about anything else.  <br>  <br>  Maybe it's the same for Franks.  Maybe we get the kind of government we ask for.

I don't particularly think they look too good but its no problem in the Army.  Good luck to you and thank him for serving.|`|htaxf1jJaa	No he won't get in trouble for it but he should let them know about it because one main reason they ask if they have tattoos is for identification purposes just in case anything happens when deployed or what not. Only gang related or racist tattoos will not be tolerated in the military and if it shows when wearing uniform but he should be fine.<br>  <br>  My bf has a tattoo on his back and he just graduated on Friday and they didn't care about it.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	Nope, sure won't.  I got tattoos you couldn't see while enlisted and even when processed out (they do a final physical) no one had anything to say.

I'm sure if we were talking about a poor, inner city Black man, you'd be ready to protest over it. Additionally, running for office and voting are NOT the same thing.<br>  <br>  Second, I find it simply astounding that you libbies keep bringing up the oxycontin thing when Obama has admitted to doing cocaine. It is extremely easy to become addicting to oxycontin since one can become addicted to it with the first dose (but then I wouldn't expect you libbies to be up on such news) as people become addicted to PAIN medication all the time. Cocaine is simply recreational and has no medicinal purpose. Why is it OK with you libbies that your President used recreational drugs that are also highly addicting but a private citizen who becomes addicted to a highly addicting pain medication is somehow despicable? Naturally, you don't see the hypocrisy in that. <br>  <br>  Further, Rush needs nothing to dull the pain of hate since his millions of listeners do not hate him. Your hatred is what he enjoys. Now stop listening to him; your leader has told you not to.|`|meVH73dOaa	And Obama is a crack head and and pot head. And the difference is what?

As Sullenberger put it:<br>  <br>  "One way of looking at this might be that, for 42 years, I've been making small regular deposits in this bank of experience: education and training ...

There are competing interests when it comes to dealing with the issue of birds that compete with planes for airspace (and in dealing with the issue of human expansion into the habitats of other creatures as well).

I would say that Britain started gaining political power in the world around the time of the crusades in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries and that it has grown ever since.
AUQY2aakaa	97% of sex offenses are committed by someone known to the family. With that piece of knowledge, you are 33 times more likely to be victimized by a family member or accepted friend than a sex offender. Sex offenders as a whole have the lowest reoffense rates among all classes of criminals, the rates slips to near zero as the severity of the original offense diminishes.<br>  Sex offenders are people to. A 19 year old guy who had consesual sex with his 17 year old girlfriend is a child molester by law and in most states required to register for life. The registries don't differentiate. <br>  The whole "get his side of the story" thing is obtrusive to his life. He does not owe you, or anybody else an explanation, regardless of what he did. How would you like to relive the toughest part of your life every day until you die?<br>  Feel free to reseerch this person, but I would be very careful confronting him. This issue has left 602,000 registered sex offenders in this country with a very heavy burden. The vast majority of which committed VERY minor crimes.|`|c26378b0778c0dc5452f0b109171dba5aa	I really think I would get their side of the story first. unless there are several offenses against him.

PPrGDCCiaa	All who see paradise as hell will learn, Paradise was not Hell. Read: (Luke-16-23-31) In Hell the rich man lift up his eyes being in torments, and sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Larazus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue, for I am tormented in this flame. But Abraham said, son remember your lifetime, you received good things, and likewise Larazus evil things, but now he is comforted, and you are tormented. Besides all this, there is a great gulf fixed, so that they which would pass from here to you cannot, neither they (in hell) pass to us. Paradise was a holding place for old testament saints who were waiting on God's Promise, The Messiah to come. Christ came and died on the Cross, on the third day He arose from the dead, so did they.  (Matthew-27-52-53) The Soul of New testament saints go up into Heaven, not down into paradise. There is no longer a holding place, the soul of those who deny Jesus as their Messiah go straight to Hell.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Karl Rove<br>  Adolph Hitler<br>  Bill Kristol

As a conservative, I'm very much in favor of the US, as are most conservatives in Europe. Conservatives in Europe generally look to the US as the most free society in the world. Unfortunately, conservatives (liberals over here) are the minority in Europe.<br>  <br>  There are many misconceptions about America roaming around in Europe. Some sincerely thinks that Americans intellectually are disfranchised. many get their view of America from people like Michael Moore - I've talked to multiple people who thinks that healthcare is only available to the super rich, while middle-class citizens frequently die from being denied access to hospitals--not one of them knows about the cost of insurance, nor do they care about rights granted by the US constitution and the programs run by the US government.<br>  <br>  Many misconceptions evolves around poverty and homelessness - I often present such people with data that shows, that homelessness and poverty, in America, is pretty much equal to that of Scandinavia. I once found data suggesting that the homelessness rate is higher in Denmark (the world's most taxed nation) than in the US.<br>  <br>  Many also thinks that, in the US, you cannot live a life with high standard of living, while this, of course, being a false statement.<br>  <br>  Generally Europeans' view on America is based on ignorance, lack of knowledge, misinformation and a highly anti-American government-run school system, made up entirely of socialists (socialist parties forms the majority, at least, in Scandinavia).<br>  <br>  The story, however, is much different with people who have actually been to the US - in the US, compared to Europe, everything's big - we call the US the big country (not because of the stupid stereotype that Americans are fat). I've never met anyone who've ever been to the US that didn't like it and didn't want to travel to see it all.<br>  <br>  Me, I love the US. There's no place I'd rather live.

The ideals that made this country are the antithesis of liberal thought.<br>  2) It is easy to demonize the big guy.  <br>  3) People believe in the world and the wealth created by her populations as a static thing, a pie of which everyone is entitled a slice.  America tends to have the most and it is therefore asserted that we have somehow forcibly acquired our wealth.  Unfortunately this model is wrong because the wealth of the world is something that must be constantly generated, and freedom is what kept government from destroying that process here leading up to this point.  <br>  <br>  Freedom is what they have been lacking.

Somewhere in that search you will find that an international tribunal did find the American government guilty of international terrorism for mining Managua's civilian harbor.<br>  <br>  Consider the definition of terrorism--something like the attempt to coerce political concessions through the use or threat of force--and then consider that our invasion of Iraq was purely that; and totally illegal under international law.<br>  <br>  You can make your case.

Hardly a threat at all. However now it is one big terrorist training ground. There are more terrorists training in Iraq than ever before. Plus more American lives have been lost fighting in Iraq that could possibly have been lost if there was no invasion. <br>  <br>  2) Bush said that he was going to save us all from Iraqi WMD, but there were no WMD to save us from. It was a complete rip.<br>  <br>  3) Bush secretly wanted to get his hands on Iraqi oil, but things are so bad there that it will be a decade or more before Iraqi oil can be fully exploited. That's thousands of Americans dead and injured, for pretty much nothing. We'd have gotten more oil simply by bribing Iraqi officials.<br>  <br>  So far there have been hundreds of thousands of dead, mass human suffering, and all for nothing. Even the much vaunted Iraqi democracy is fake. It's not democratic at all because half of the candidates were either murdered or prohibited from standing.

But I think we should leave the "nation building " and spreading of "democracy" alone.

6Fsliwlhaa	If you need money NOW joining the Army won't get it.  You won't get your first paycheck until around a month after you ship to basic and if you qualify for a bonus you won't get your first payment until after you complete AIT.  I would still recommend joining but your family might need to look into public assistance while you wait.  If you provide at least 50% of support for your family you can apply to make them a dependent so you can qualify for BAH but if you do you won't be able to live in the barracks after you finish training.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	If you think you will like army life, then yes  - it`s as good as any other occupation - and better in some ways (certainly more secure).<br>  But the army (or the Air Force) is not for everyone.  Some temperaments do not suit the life - and once you have signed up there is no way back (not an easy one anyway).|`|IOU6zo9Raa	Yes, the military is a great OPTION if that is the case. I would never recommend the Army to any one. Look into the different branches. Just remember, you can't just do it for the money. You have to dedicate your life to the military, even if only a few years of it. You may not always be around for your family, but the military will always keep a roof over their heads and provide healthcare and a steady paycheck. Also, it will take several weeks possibly to get you in and while you are at basic training it may take a while and a lot of paper work for them to recieve your first paycheck. you CAN support a family off of a military paycheck. It's still not easy though. You don't start out making much when you enlist, even if you have some college credits. Good luck.|`|PvCngXKIaa	Joining the military should be a personal decision that is not made on the prospect of cash that will disappear quickly and without your ability to replenish it just as quickly.  What I'm trying to say is that military service is a long term commitment and the pay is not spectacular but the burden you might be required to bear as a result of your commitment could, in the long term, be financially ruinous.  You should work to solve your financial problems and if you succeed, and you will succeed, and you still desire to put on a uniform and serve your country it will be done out of patriotism and not necessity.  Good luck to you.<br>  PS - I'm a veteran of the US Army.|`|dcZcPtIoaa	make sure that you qualify, before considering the military!|`|UqLEMXAgaa	I miss the Army everyday.|`|mMUuBd0Caa	You wanna know if the Army is a good choice? Well Actually yes it is a very good choice indeed. For instance what is the economy doing right now its going from bad to even worse. People in the Army or any branch of service arent affected by it at all or shouldnt be. You say ""you need money fast. You can get it and yes you may get deployed well that is just even more money for you. Take it form somebody that has been there its really not that bad at all. The Air Force well if you can get the Air Force recruiter to call you back you may ba able to get in with them but the dont promote you that fast therefore your making less money for a longer period of time unlike the Army.|`|X8CaMCe6aa	Putting aside your financial issues (and I can't provide a better response without knowing all the facts of your situation) the military is a great choice.  However, if the only reason you wish to join the military is because you're in a financial strain don't do it.  Serving the military is a unique experience and shouldn't be joined simply out of desperation.  I'm a 22-year veteran of the military, and from time to time I would come across newly arrived recruits who joined for the wrong reasons.  The bottom line is if your heart isn't in it, and you think it will quickly resolve your financial problems, you need to consider other options.|`|7G6sZSi6aa	YES.<br>  The Army has great benifits along with decent pay. You can live in on-post housing, free health care and dental. Lots of support for your family, right at your finger-tips.<br>  I say the best answer is yes. Do it.<br>  Yes, you might deploy, but that is what we do. It is the Army<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|VQ4VYjBVaa	Join the Air Force, they are a bit better on family and stuff like that. But don't join solely for the money. There is a good chance you will get deployed. so keep that in mind.|`|WnYjLVtdaa	If you don't have any problems with health, and you are courage enough - why not?|`|h0qCKbzNaa	i think if its for your family then yes... otherwise no..

Capital Gains or gifts from friends or family, for example. In some places estate monies or lottery winnings are taxable too. <br>  <br>  I am not a tax lawyer, or any type of lawyer for that matter, but that settlement could certainly be considered taxable.

C7wjR42Daa	This is a classic example of how you younger dudes get misinformed. You even have Marines here misleading you.<br>  <br>  Yes, every Marine is a rifleman first, but that doesnt mean you're  going into combat.<br>  <br>  Whatever your job is then that is what you will be doing no matter where you get sent to.<br>  <br>  People have this great misconception that every Marine regardless of MOS is out there in the thick of things. That is stupid talk.<br>  <br>  Lets assume you are a aircraft mechanic or an admin Marine. Why would you all of a sudden be sent off into combat?? This makes no sense.<br>  <br>  The only way every Marine will see combat is if the USA had been over run and was caught very short handed.<br>  <br>  The USMC is NOT short on bodies, so why would non infantry Mairnes be doing infantry combat fighting?<br>  <br>  No matter your MOS you might stand a watch, or go on a convoy and have to actually pay attention. Don't confuse this with combat.|`|yP1cvzYmaa	Every marine starts as a RifleMan, From there you can choose different objetive/positions as a marine such as more technology based like you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you choose to do lets say some I/T computer job in the marines, you will not see as much combat as a marine who is only a rifleman.|`|RyFCRcIUaa	YES! As a Marine YOU are Infantry first then your job (mechanic, cook, paper pusher, mechanic, aviation,bandsman,chaplain's assistant, etc....)<br>  second!<br>  <br>  YOU will most likely deploy into combat!|`|LNatMloraa	a Marines first job is as a "rifleman" <br>  <br>  Your MOS is secondary|`|esOaJoqBaa	Perro De Lava is right, just ignore those other answers.<br>  Every Marine is trained as a rifleman. That means that in a worst case scenario you have the training to effectively fight. This does not mean that admin guys, or cooks actively go out on patrol looking for the enemy.<br>  <br>  Unless you are infantry or a handful of other MOS you will probably never actively seek out a fight. You may end up on a convoy that gets ambushed and have to shoot your way out, but that is it. You will not be kicking in doors or patrolling the streets.<br>  <br>  If you choose a technical job like tank or truck mechanic, or a computer job you will probably never see a fight. You will be trained and conditioned for the time that it may happen though.<br>  <br>  The Marine Corps would be foolish to take under trained Marines and put them into the fight. Everybody does what they are trained for, and the grunts are the only ones who train to fight. That is all they do, and they are the most well equiped to do it.

If you really want the truth, do some research on Obama/Soetoro and his backers.  The evidence points to him still being an Indonesian citizen with the legal name Soetoro, not Obama.|`|V44ARW4maa	lol @ you "looking for the truth" in here...thats quite a chuckle. So, the answer to your "question" about whether bush lied, would be best found in some books on the subject--books by those who served under him, like scott mcclellan's What Happened or richard clarke's Your Government Failed You and Against all Enemies or by former republicans that are familiar with the inside workings of the white house, like john dean's Conservatives without Conscience and/or Broken Government. You could also read books by historians or news media, like tom rick's Hubris. Lots of books will be written on the disaster that was the bush years--mostly truthful accounts--but you won't find much truth in here.|`|hgX6Gnpeaa	He did. His friends would ask him if a race horse who was favored to win , would actually win tomorrow. Then they would bet on the horse, only if W told them that horse would lose, they never lost money.<br>  <br>  Get it? if W said the horse would lose, that is a lie so the horse would win|`|9MIqiHwSaa	That's a lie.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	He lied to justify his actions. Yes, he told us what he was going to do, but he lied about the reasons he was doing it. That isn't so hard to understand.

We will be the sheep being led to slaughter.|`|AA11598520	I'm not sure it held any truth then, either. It's kinda like when you're in Catholic school, one of the things we're taught is that the people are the Church. Of course, in reality, we don't matter nearly as much as the system called "the Church."|`|ESWdyM6Haa	The answer is 'YES' but it depends on who 'the people' are that you are talking about...|`|0fd4023533dd0a61838399a036b4147baa	no|`|hUYaaXBvaa	the government is the people<br>  but really it is specific powerful people who become the government<br>  we still have power but we think we dont because others seem to be more influential|`|LVZdzPmpaa	No. All you have to do is look at the national map of the recent election results.
GZVMl494aa	lots of people hate my point of view on that.  close the US borders for 5-7 years to force self reliance then over a period of 2-3 years slowly open them back up.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	No. The notion that separating oneself from others brings "peace" is false. What it does is make people strangers to each other. Those who trade and interact get to know each other and become friends.  And friends are far less likely to fight than strangers.<br>  <br>  It also takes away much of the power of demagogues. It is impossible to spread lies and fear that (to take one example) "all Muslims are violent" if if the people the demagogue is lying to know some Muslims ad so know for themselves that the lie is just that--a lie intended only to spread hate and fear.|`|2sPWYf5Paa	In my opinion, the answer is NO. The fact is that not all countries have equal resources and means to provide sustainment for their populations.  The help provided by other countries will always be needed.

The world is not willing to stand by and let that happen.|`|2052689f97fd82ff22110a85457f0dedaa	You gotta spread the love....

Smaller countries don't have the land mass or best soil to produce the food needed for their own citizens, but as long as they have a worth while commodity they are able to trade. We don't expect the Saudis to produce their own food but we take their oil in trade. There are a great many cases like this. <br>  <br>  Your idea would have merit if we lived in a perfect world.

AA11598520	She was a 19 year old campaign worker for Ted Kennedy while he was running for congress; I'm not sure if he was running as a rep or a Senator. While married, he decided to have some "nookie" with her, as was typical of the Kennedy brothers, after a campaign party that they both attended. Both had been drinking. <br>  <br>  Ted decided to take a road that was desolate, unlighted, and cross a rickety wooden bridge over a lake, I think it was a lake. Since he was DUI, he went off the bridge and into the water. Naturally, as is again typical of a Kennedy, he thought only of himself AND his reputation since it wouldn't look too good for the election if the story hit the news and he was coming out of the water with a teenage campaign volunteer. <br>  <br>  Soooo...he left her their to drown, saved himself and disappeared overnight, probably huddling with his staff and family to come up with a good cover story. The Kennedys also paid a huge sum of money to Mary Jo's parents (Mary Jo was an only child.) to keep their silence. How any amount of money would be enough is beyond me. They tried to pay off as many investigators as they could be the lead investigator, the local sheriff refused to take it, I believe.<br>  <br>  That's why Ted should be just getting out of prison for manslaughter instead of being an influential senator. Her murder and his complicity in rapes of other women while he was partying with cousins.<br>  <br>  Yeah, we have to cut the murderer a break because HE is now dying a slow, and hopefully, painful death. Nothing he doesn't deserve.|`|AcWMpmPwaa	well winonagal, you have enough answers here besides a halfway decent link to gather info on this, i remember this well as it was another blip on the kennedy political screen. it basically ruined ted's chances for a run at the presidency after roberts assassination which everybody knew he would do. unfortunately he has always been the brunt of the got-cha hypocrisy politics as is byrd from w.va with his ties to the kkk. another sad situation that deals with our elected leaders trying to preach their ideals on us when hey have demons in the closet!!!|`|2zgv89OQaa	She drowned back around the year of 1969.

Sure banks and auto companies get bailed out, what about us Americans? 401K is being taken away, more foreclosures, job loss. What next? and your relieved? What has he done for you so far, seriously!.  of course we are equal, always had for many years. So, do you really think you had voted for color and to try and make history or did you go for his views?. My opinion is i am happy to see a black man who made it for president, what i don't like is that obama is really not helping us as american people. we had to borrow more money from china, china is going to own America, what next!|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Being AA, I realized the symbolic nature and watched with an open mind.

But most of all I felt so amazed that enough people in this country could be swayed by a gifted speaker with little or no substance and an agenda that will harm this country and the people in their ability to bath in the freedom and opportunity that this country has always been the beneficiary of. Now most people will look to the government and Obama to fix all of their troubles in a socialist way.<br>  <br>  And as Margret Thatcher once said, "the problem with socialism is, that you eventually run out of other peoples money".<br>  <br>  3000 point drop in the stock market since the introduction of  a socialist stimmy-us package.<br>  <br>  And yes, it was on it's way down (Not at this extreme) while GB was in office (because his policies were also partly socialist). But it really all began during the Carter admin and his fare housing acts. We can not maintain people that are unwilling to maintain themselves. Until this policy of large government and governmental controls in places other then fare trade, the military and the infrastructure lessons we are on a road to failure as a powerful and rich nation of people.<br>  <br>  Oh, And Good Guys Answer, Typical Zombie Mentality.

When we have the likes of rush limplaw openly rooting for obama to fail, it only serves to divide this country even further than it was. We are not divided along the lines of color, black and white, but along economic lines of the rich 1% who oppose taxes and the 99% poor who can't even afford the basic necessities.|`|bA06K9INaa	Like a baby.

lyhnHhuWaa	I couldn't agree with you more.  I find that both of the two major parties have agenda items that would move our country in a positive direction, and that refusing to recognize the good ideas of each is a poor way to go about running a country.  I live in a neighborhood composed of folks with wildly varied political beliefs.  We're able to hold educated discussions about politics, some a little more heated than others, then turn around and smile while we enjoy a few margaritas together.  This forum, however, offers the advantage of anonymity and the security of knowing that one will never have to face anyone they're "speaking" to.  It's been known to bring out the "internet tough gal" in me more than once.

A "clenched fist" can be unclenched and become a hand ready to shake or cooperate so in theory and word there is a peaceful way forward.<br>  <br>  Dennis Ross is a PNAC Neocon who wants war with Iran. Ross, who has a close association with the Bush administration’s right-wing neocons, was quite open about the role that Obama could play. “When you have someone like President-elect Obama as president, it is a lot harder to demonize the United States,” he told his audience. In other words, the Obama administration will be able to carry out policies that the widely despised Bush administration is simply incapable of implementing<br>  Far from bringing an end to US militarism as tens of millions of American voters hoped for, the Obama administration is preparing to consolidate a US presence in Iraq and escalate the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The prospect of a dangerous new war looms as Obama’s advisers lay out their plans for confronting Iran.<br>  <br>  For those in the US establishment, Obama’s emerging foreign policy comes as no surprise. As the Stratfor think tank commented: “Obama’s supporters believed that Obama’s position on Iraq was profoundly at odds with the Bush administration’s. We could never clearly locate the difference. The brilliance of Obama’s presidential campaign was that he convinced his hard-core supporters that he intended to make a radical shift in policies across the board, without ever specifying what policies he was planning to shift, and never locking out the possibility of a flexible interpretation of his commitments.”<br>  <br>  The foreign policy heavyweights who supported Obama for president clearly hope to extend this “brilliance” in duping people onto the world stage as the US continues to aggressively pursue its economic and strategic interests in the Middle East and internationally.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov2008/pers-n26.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/nov200...</a>|`|X81oLqMtaa	While I agree that Ross was a poor selection by Obama, I don't think that the clenched fist comment was directed toward the people of Iran, but to Ahmadinejab specifically.<br>  <br>  I would like to see Khatami (sp) win the election this year and return moderation to the Iranian presidency.  There is no reason why our 2 nations should not be allies against the Taliban and al-Qaida.  <br>  <br>  Not all Americans have forgotten the assistance that Iran gave the US right after 9/11 in herding the Taliban and tracking down members of al-Qaida near the Iran/Afgani border.   <br>  <br>  Bush's "axis of evil" comment was pure stupidity, was placed in the speech by his neocon/Israeli handlers and I bet he regrets it now.|`|pM81f5tnaa	"Axis of evil" has religious connotations, and therefore can be particularly provocative to fundamentalists.  Also, it implies that a person, or country, or culture, is incorrigible.  If somebody's fist is clenched, he's angry, and there might be something one can do about that.  If somebody is evil, then he needs to be eliminated.

I know it will turn out exactly like the Bible describes in the book of Revelation.|`|AuWHIJPKaa	This describes the New World Order:<br>  And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore. Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns were ten diadems, and on his heads were blasphemous names. And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. I saw one of his heads as if it had been slain, and his fatal wound was healed And the whole earth was amazed and followed after the beast; they worshiped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who is able to wage war with him?" There was given to him a mouth speaking arrogant words and blasphemies, and authority to act for forty-two months was given to him. And he opened his mouth in blasphemies against God, to blaspheme His name and His tabernacle, that is, those who dwell in heaven. It was also given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, and authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation was given to him. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who has been slain. If anyone has an ear, let him hear. If anyone is destined for captivity, to captivity he goes; if anyone kills with the sword, with the sword he must be killed Here is the perseverance and the faith of the saints. Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon. He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence And he makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth in the presence of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound of the sword and has come to life. And it was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast would even speak and cause as many as do not worship the image of the beast to be killed. And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free men and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and he provides that no one will be able to buy or to sell, except the one who has the mark, either the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.|`|y1MpW4sEaa	No I don’t think it will work unless it was headed by God or Jesus… Mostly the people who want a NWO are corrupt individuals who want to control the world and oppress people for horrible agendas.<br>  <br>  So far it looks like the UN, Barack Obama & Gordon Brown want to head it up… They were talking about it earlier this week.|`|VzIWDuRzaa	God's plan is right on track, He tried to warn us.

You can afford cell phones, startbucks coffee, bottled water, and HDTV service, why can't you afford healthcare?<br>  3. If you are out of work, get a job.  Maybe it won't pay as much as the one that laid you off, but it will probably pay better then unemployment.<br>  4. Increasing taxes on small businesses, large businesses, and wage earners stagnates the economy, it does not stimulate it.<br>  5, If you bought more house than you can afford, that's your problem, not the taxpayers.<br>  6. The way to get out of debt is to pay it off, not to spend more.<br>  7. Tax cuts benefit everyone.  Got money in an IRA, 401(k), or stocks/mutual funds?  Does your bank?  Cutting the capital gains tax means those funds pay less every year in taxes, and the dividends go up.  Increase capital gains taxes, and your retirement fund stagnates.<br>  8.

When you're poor or when you're making $250k+ a year?<br>  <br>  Poor people have to spend money. They don't make enough to store away money. They have to spend money to survive. Rich people have the luxury to only spend a small percentage of their income while saving the additional money.<br>  <br>  When you give money to rich people they keep it. They don't get the money and say, "hmmm, I should share this with my employees." They're in the business of making as much money as they can and not sharing any of it. Poor people don't have that option thus they will spend the money and fuel the economy.<br>  <br>  BTW, look at all of the liberal countries out there that are doing just fine under similar models. Eventually you'll have to admit that Republicans are full of horrible ideas and really only benefit 1-2% of Americans.

43zXRpLYaa	If there was any place that it has died would be in California. The election districts are so messed up that the same dopes get re-elected every single time. These same dopes have run the state into the toilet. They have overspent year after year after year and are bought and paid for by the teachers, prison guard, and state workers unions. Because of their overspending, despite the state already being the highest taxed state, despite already being the most business unfriendly state, despite the middle class and small businesses fleeing the state in droves, despite having the worst schools in the nation, despite having the fourth highest unemployment in the country, and despite having the worst traffic in the US, have decided to raise taxes through the roof and cut billions from schools.<br>  <br>  Here's an example.

That dream was alive until this president took office.  Now, the ones who don't work hard and were irresponsible will be rewarded for their behavior.<br>  I have dreamt that I could be treated fairly, that my family had it's own home, that we could save enough to retire comfortably and to educate our kids.<br>  That dream has been removed from me in the last 6 or 7 weeks.  I'm sad, discouraged and feel that no matter how hard we work, we'll be slapped in the face for our success.<br>  We're not rich, but we have been adequately paid and up until these last few months, we had money in our retirement account and were confident of our future.<br>  Now, I feel the "losers" who have not paid their bills and not worked hard enough to keep a decent job will be rewarded and my family will have to foot the bill.  All-the-while when we have lost more than half our retirement savings and we will not be allowed to claim those losses.<br>  Thanks alot BO, we really appreciate our American dream being completely removed/erased.  We are all miserable and depressed and feel that no matter how hard we work, we can never rise above and recoup from our losses.<br>  To top it off, every time this man speaks the market goes down and people lose more of their life savings.  He has made naive decisions and choices that will only bankrupt our country.<br>  I doubt my husband and I will be able to afford to keep our home when we retire, but we are not expecting anyone to bail us out, either.<br>  I won't use the language that I have called this man who is not my president here but be assured that I think he is the lowest of the low.  His choices have hurt us more than any president has ever hurt a family and he's not even close to being done yet.|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Hell, America is not still alive, how could the American dream be?

A dream can't die - only your chance of acheiving it. In America, though, there are ways to acheive that dream, if you know your ways. Not many know them, buy they are out there. Keep looking.

3HGf7UHZaa	the republican.  people would actually work and support individualism and capitalism<br>  <br>  whereas the democrats would constantly redistribute wealth causing them to be in a constant state of economic stagnancy|`|xNsJqTgaaa	You really would never know untill you see it.  Plus you have to consider other factors, like trade.  When you say self sustaining, do you mean they can't trade with other nations?  <br>  <br>  Can they buy car from a foriegn country or do they have to make their own?  Can they have Nissan come to their country and build them right there or do they have to build them themselves?  Keep in mind that ford, Chrysler and GM(and Harley Davidson motorcycles and Boeing airplanes for that matter) are all bulit in blue states.  Computers and software that aren't outsourced are pretty much made in blue states(although Texas instruments could be brought back to life).  Ivy league schools and military academies, all blue states.  <br>  <br>  Ports? mostly Blue states, but red states have enough to survive just fine.<br>  <br>  We would all be short on oil.  The red states might actually do better on this point because of a lower population relative to oil and coal production, but blue states might do better because their dedication to alternative energy.<br>  <br>  Entertainment, clearly goes to the blue states, they have hollywood, Broadway and such, plus they have more than half of all professional sports teams.  That being said, more than half of all Pro Athletes come from Red states, and most country music comes from red states as well as a growing percentage of hip-hop music.<br>  <br>  Tourism is better for blue states, they got Hawaii, Florida, New York, California and Pennsylvania....All top 5 tourist states!  None of the top 5 are red states, in fact, none of the top 8 are red states.  Texas and Tennessee are number 9 and 10.<br>  <br>  Blue states have better health care, better doctors, better hospitals.  Kudos to Texes for inventing the breast implant, but the mayo clinic, Johns Hopkins, Mt Sinai, Harvard medical school, all the greats are in the blue states.<br>  <br>  Military, well Blue states win there too, They have all the major academies, of course red states have some good military schools too, like the citadel.  Blue states have plenty of bases, but Red states have more including more nukes.  Most Naval bases(almost all of them) are in Blue states.  Most command centers are in blue states and most basic training camps are in red states.  So basically, there would be a major realignment.<br>  <br>  Trees, logging is done mostly in Blue states, but there are plenty of treas in red states too, so they would be fine as long as they are willing to plant new ones.<br>  <br>  Food...Oranges, California and florida(blue states) Dairy(California, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa) Apples.....We're talking blue states items.  But the red states would be able to survive with what they have, it isn't non existant in red states.<br>  <br>  Beef, the red states have this one, hands down,  But blue states have a lot of vegetarians so how much do they need?<br>  <br>  Guns...Colt, Smith & Wesson, remington and US firearms are all blue state companies, while Barettas are a made in Tenn.  Browning is made in a red state(utah) and they also make guns for winchester in Utah, although Winchestor is owned in a blue state.   So that's kind of a suprise.  Steel...well that's a blue state thing.<br>  <br>  The hard thing to see is how they would adapt, and how there policies would change?  Seriously, if red states won't levi taxes, who will fix their roads?  I could go on, including some digs on blue states, but it will take forever.<br>  <br>  My money is on blue states, but I would hate to see it.  America is the United states of America.  I love Texas, just don't live there.  I love Mardi Gras in New Orleans.  I love Brett Favre(in a platonic way).  I love watching anyone beat the Dallas Cowboys and I love fishing in Alaska and Wyoming.  I love driving through Montana, they do have some fun college girls.  <br>  <br>  I live in a blue state, but it takes all 50 to make the America I know and love.|`|vDLnslBFaa	<a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2004/09/red_states_feed.html" rel="nofollow">http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/...</a><br>  For red states talk of self reliance, they surely take a lot of dollars from blue states.<br>  I don't think I could live of the land no matter what my political affiliation is.

SaDwYkI4aa	if you  do get a restraining order that will just make him more mad. and it is just a piece of paper. it is not a brick barrier around your daughter. what about charging him with harrassment. if your daughter is 18 or over, then SHE  has to do the restraining order.  <br>  have you spoken to his parents?  the police sound like a Joke ! <br>  I would write a letter to the Police Chief and tell him about how you cannot get any protection and if this guy hurts your daughter, that you will go straight to the newspaper and write how you tried to get help but the police dept refused you.<br>  make a police report EVERYTIME he harrasses her. EVERYTIME that way you will have that on file should anything happen.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you don't mention the age of your daughter.  if she is over age 18, she will have to take care of this herself.  if she is under age 18, contact your lawyer and the local police.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Your daughter can get the necessary restraining order against this person as long as she is an adult..she can press charges against him.. Or contact your state's attorney general for assistance..consult a lawyer..go to the local paper to expose him|`|AA12034666	It might be somewhat "underhanded", but I wouldn't be "above" setting up something. Bating him into a situation where he would have to show his true colors, in a place where there would be witnesses. Be creative. Take your time and think it through. But if I had no other choice, that's what I would do.<br>  <br>  If he's all you say he is I don't know why the police like him. If this is a small town, could the police force be "complacent"? Afraid of retribution? Maybe if you got a lawyer involved, you could get action.|`|jDgoqQeVaa	Get a video camera and tape him, then if the local cops do not take action, call the state attorney general, get a lawyer and sue the cops and the ex.<br>  You can also have her get a gun without anyone knowing and then tell him how bad in bed he was so that he comes into the house, self defense, she is okay and he is dead.|`|Tm11j4yXaa	Oh my, it seems this man needs serious help!<br>  Perhaps a restraining order cannot even keep him away, is there any way you can just file charges against him?  That way, he gets locked up somewhere and your daughter will have peace and quiet....|`|lmSoNMhPaa	i would get a handgun,cause people listen better to it than a piece of paper.if the cops will not do any thing about it, contact your state AG.get her a cell phone too with a cam in it.|`|4pXAeKE8aa	put up a hidden camera and keep it on next time he shows up. make sure you hide it well so he doent see it. i hope he gets cought and your daughter will be safe again.|`|CSvxBO4Yaa	Not that I doubt you...it's just there are many women that outright lie or in most occassions ...kind of tell a ridiculous claim of a guy annoying them that actually stems from a mixture of paranoa and conceit.<br>  <br>  Meaning these chicks see what they want to see which usually is supported by a biased viewpoint. An example....If a guy is supposely "staring" at them..but in actuality he is really just looking in their general direction and might actually be thinking about a burger with fries. Doesn't even realize he was even looking at her. His mind was elsewhere but the chick...well she's so cocky or paranoid or a little of both that she assumes the worst simply because he's not her type. That's just one common example.<br>  <br>  So, I can understand why the cops won't do anything without witnesses.<br>  Anyone can make an accusation..even against you. Think about it and then realize false accusations do come into play quite often. <br>  It sucks for true victims like you're daughter.<br>  <br>  NOW here is a suggestion:<br>  <br>      I suggest setting up a couple hidden cameras to record her yard and other areas. See if you catch him cutting another tire.<br>  Also an audio recorder tied into your phone to record his harassing phone calls...although I don't know if that is legal where you live.<br>  Ask your court lawyers.<br>  <br>  But if you really do have all the facts and several other victims stories...I suggest you present that to the police. Several women who had the exact same problem should at least get you a restraining order but I'm no expert. <br>  <br>  Also...I have met people who are real dirtbags in the sense that they do real nasty things...but they are also charming and cool. People who hardly know them will never see the real evil in them. That's why you should also think about taking your problem with a higher court or state level. If the local cops/judges allow their personal feelings get in the way of really investigating a problem....see if you can pass over them to the state level.<br>  <br>  <br>  Write a letter to your congressman and explain in detail with witness names. And see if then can help you.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Why in the world do they like him???  This is a terrible situation and one of the few that I suggest doing this.  Buy her a gun and have her learn how to use it.  I would not take the chance of him escalating this and putting her life at risk.  She needs to keep this gun with her at all times.  In the house, she should take it from room to room.  <br>  <br>  I will not go into details but a similar situation happened in a small town not far from where I live.  The woman begged police to do something but they didn't.  It escalated until he attacked her with a knife.  I don't have to tell you the rest of it.  If it were my daughter, I would buy her the best gun I could afford.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I just assumed she was over 18 for some reason.  If she is a minor, set up security cameras all around your house.  They can turn so you don't have to buy too many.  Have her park so her car is always in view of the camera too.<br>  <br>  When she goes somewhere, have her park close to the front of stores, in well-lighted, high traffic areas.|`|QsVMeaPXaa	Can her car be kept in a garage? If you don't have one, perhaps she can rent an unused one in the neighborhood to keep her car safe. She should carry pepper spray at all times (and know how to use it) Check and see if Tasers are legal where you live. <br>  Why do the police like him? He must be on record for his past actions.<br>  I'd call the District Attorney's office and talk with them about her options.<br>  <br>  P.S. Is there any chance of former girlfriends being contacted and perhaps backing up your daughter's experiences with this guy?<br>  <br>  I don't know if she lives with you or not. If she is going to work daily if possible have her change her route frequently, so he won't have a set pattern and be able to  follow her or know where she is. Have a cell phone handy at all times, preset to dial 911. How does he get her phone number so many times???? Have the ability to record any phone calls from him.(good for evidence)

In 8-12 years it should be easy to pick up some good companies and land at really cheap prices. It will be tough on middle class since most money is either going to go into Muni's and treasuries or go overseas, so high interest rates. We wont be starting companies in the US, so fewer jobs.

To start with, August 2010 is 18 months away and that's when he plans on having all combat activities over. The remaining force will remain to the end of the agreement Bush signed in December, after the election. Their role will be in training and assisting the Iraqis as well as counter-terrorism functions. Many are going to be moved from Iraq to the front on terror, Afghanistan.<br>  He campaigned on a 16 month timetable in the absence of any time frame. Once there was a signed deal he acknowledged he'd honor our agreement with them. He's getting us out of Iraq and fulfilling GWB's 2001 promise to "get those that harmed us". I'm all okay with this, it may be a little different than the campaign but things changed outside of his influence and the intent is still right on, so what possible reason would I have to be upset, much less angry?|`|AA11450062	Well at least Afghanistan had something to do with 911. But yes I am angry that we had a Republican Iraq War in the first place and Republicans used 911 to sell the war to Democrats. It is nice to see Obama listening to the troops on the ground unlike our former Republican administration.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	There is a HUGE difference.  The war in Iraq had nothing to do with the war on terror.  Afghanistan is where the 9/11 attackers were at.  That is the real war on terror.  I was upset with Bush because he invaded Iraq for no good reason, not because he invaded Afghanistan.|`|4c2e5d9e10f23cb24ac709dd1d50dfe6aa	Yeah I'm angry about it.  I'm fine with the roadmap for extrication though.  The problem is the war having ever been started.  But you're just playing around, right?<br>  <br>  Anyway, Bush was not often honest about his intentions.  Who knows if he would follow the "plan" he put out there.  Presumably his timetable is just what he figured Obama would do.  That way, you get to ask this question, and if McCain had won, he could distance himself from Bush if he wanted to keep the party rolling.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, though, that Obama supporters are not lefties.  The Republican party is so reviled that even ultra-conservatives like myself support Obama.|`|uj6Q5xmhaa	One reason why obama is withdrawing his troops from Iraq is may be he is in shortage of military strength for Afghanistan and Pakistan.But his decision is correct the work of military is over in Iraq and there work should start in Pakistan and Afghanistan.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	I agree, they should be since he did not pull them out any sooner---sounds like he indirectly thinks Bush's time table was correct even if not agreeing with the war itself.|`|YustEeeFaa	I agree.|`|zmmP52P3aa	I think libs must love the bait-and-switch routine.|`|KF48OjyDaa	Afghanistan was connected to 9-11...Iraq was not....that was easy

It was downgraded to a class C, but now regraded back to a class B again.<br>  <br>  When it was downgraded to a class C, it was still illegal to possess, however the police dealt with offences slightly differently. The street caution came into effect, whereby simple possession was dealt with by a street caution. More than two of these in a year would mean a court appearance. <br>  <br>  Not all simple possessions are dealt with by a street caution, it all depends on the circumstances as to how old the person is and where the drug was possessed etc. In any case the police have the option to arrest.|`|whD25cV5aa	www.talktofrank.com<br>  <br>  Need I say more??<br>  <br>  <br>  That is unless you're overly athritic though - of course.|`|e67d03e03b1fb652f308bef8be08bf6faa	It's all of those things.

That recession has continued into the first month of the president's administration, we will just call him the president because I know how you guys hate the "O" word. Things like the failures of companies like AIG and Citicorp that happened while, well, you know who was president. Yes, the numbers don't lie, but apparently Republicans are willing to. The president hasn't been able to fix eight years of mismanagement and incompetence in one month. I am not surprised and you shouldn't be either.

LKUjbuCuaa	It has little to do with either party, both of which are under the thumb of corporate giants.  It came about in part because of irresponsible use of credit, thanks to corporate policies focused on short term gain rather than long term profitability.  It also came about because low income Republican voters took out mortgages they could not afford.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, however, the lack of corporate responsibility resulted in part from laissez-faire neoconservative policy beginning under the administration of the drooling Reagan, who was controlled by corporate interests.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	The current economic situation is the result of past policies as well as present ones.<br>  <br>  Obama's policies have an effect the moment they are announced, no matter how long he has been in office.<br>  <br>  I would say that some portion of the blame for the market's and the economy's recent performance is indeed Obama's.  People see what's coming, which is not business-friendly at all.<br>  <br>  If he had announced tax cuts on work, savings and investment and spending cuts, instead of the exact opposite, the markets and therefore the economy would have immediately responded in a positive way.<br>  <br>  Obama does not get all the blame, but he gets some - from day one, and indeed from the date an Obama victory seemed likely.|`|ywOqliwKaa	Bush was a terrible conservative and allowed congress to spend.

The CEO's of companies making the enormous salaries, living like kings and the innovative mortgage loans that Clinton wanted "for everyone to have the American Dream" got us into this economic mess. I refuse to call Obama president until he proves that he was born in the USA.  Obama is trying to get government control of the banks, healthcare and everything he can. Why? He is pushing this country towards socialism, instead of the capitalist nation that we have always been. In the end, we will be worse off. The government will own everything and you will have to ask the government if and when you can go to your doctor. Of course, you will have to go to the doctor that the government says you have to go to. If this country stays on this socialist path, you will soon find that you do not have freedom of speech.

They no longer do. Small business has been the backbone of my state as employers. 80% of the small business owners have let their employees go.<br>  <br>  Yes, I have been affected by watching the misery of watching people without income not knowing how they will make it on a day to day basis.

Have you ever had a job or lost one?|`|cZypvAK8aa	My 401K has been drastically affected. I will need to work until I drop dead, if I can keep a job.|`|um87XJvmaa	I  haven't been, except for stocks.   There are three houses on our street that are going into forecloser.  A lot of people are hurting.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	Yes, mightily. <br>  <br>  The business I work for is teetering on the edge because the companies we do business with are all holding off on signing contracts due to economic uncertainty. Customers have cancelled contracts and we had to lay  off half our work force because we cannot get a business loan due to the credit crunch. As a result I could lose my job at any moment. If I do and manage to find a new job and have to move I probably won't be able to sell my house my equity is probably all gone.<br>  <br>  Most of the money we were saving for my kid's college education has evaporated and we don't know how we are going to afford to send her now.<br>  <br>  My parents are hurting because a huge hunk of their retirement income is gone.<br>  <br>  This is big stuff.

It's made it a lot harder for my family to make our bills because prices are rising, but wages are not and will not for at least this year. My mother also lost her job, and we've been trying to keep her from losing her house. So, yes, we have been affected by the recession. My husband and I got lucky when it came to our jobs. 200+ people were laid off where we work, and we made the cuts. But if we had been laid off, we would have been screwed.

MvDu7hZmaa	Yes.  Drugs are not sold because someone is<br>  interested in making sure that you're having a<br>  good time getting high.  Drugs are sold to make<br>  money.  And the money made from drugs does<br>  not stop at small time dealers.  Drugs are an<br>  industry, an underground economy, and you <br>  are supporting the entire system even when<br>  purchasing from a small scale distributor.<br>  <br>  Another fact about marijuana is that it is known<br>  as a gateway drug which can lead to substances<br>  that are addictive, such as alcohol or heroin.<br>  A lot of money is made with those substances,<br>  so once again, buying marijuana adds to the<br>  culture of supporting people who make money<br>  from illegal drugs.<br>  <br>  The problem of supporting a drug economy<br>  does not stop at illegal substances.  We should<br>  also consider the support we give to legal drugs<br>  such as tobacco, or even pain killers.|`|lJGnuMbbaa	no peers are not supporting violence. the drugs from mexico are coke and hard line drugs. most maryjo is from the USA  other countries grow hashish|`|YFzprqqgaa	This time of the year, almost all mary jane is brought in from mexico.

If they did build their nation, and did take care of their people, the corruption would have to go.  The control of the Army and police would fall away, and people in high places would very likely not do so well.<br>  <br>  It is going to happen.  Many think we are on a revolution to a new source of power for the world... clean coal, nuclear power, solar, wind.<br>  <br>  Nuclear Power has a chance of making the old way of life continue, but the rest, and this country seems determined to disregard Nuclear Power, are unreliable, and not enough.  When Mexico wakes up and realizes they are going to slide backward, or come forward with nuclear power, I believe the corruption of the Mexican Government may well go away.<br>  <br>  Suggesting they are exploited by Americans is REALLY.. wrong.

But the man can just walk away if he wants to, which I believe is wrong; they should stand up and act like a man if they had sex and took the risk. Yes it is the woman that gets pregnant but there has to be the sperm from the guy. <br>  <br>  The woman however is the one who has to go through the 9 months of pregnancy and birth, so if she wants to have sex then that is a risk she is taking. But it is the fathers responsibility to be there for the child because it takes two to tango. Partly his fault.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in abortion at all. Partly because if the father wants the baby and the woman wants it aborted, he has no say in the matter and the woman can pretty much say **** you I'm aborting it. It's half of the man inside her. It's not just her baby leading to my opinion that it is both of there faults she got pregnant.<br>  <br>  Your brother stood by his opinion and didn't take the risk of possibly getting a woman pregnant.

If there are 2 children, I think it's 25%. These figures are a guideline and can be altered in your divorce agreement. (I am also in NY and currently in the one-year waiting period of a sep agreement and I opted for less than the 17% that I could have asked for).  I have primary custody and my ex has visitation privileges.  Even if your ex has no visitation, you are still entitled to support.<br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to discuss this with your attorney (Yes, I know, any conversation with the attorney is "on the clock" but to resolve the issue, it should be done right).<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember that asking for support is not begging, but in the best interests of your child(ren).|`|xxDjV6Axaa	You still have the right to child support based on the state guidelines or chart.  Custody, visitation, etc, is a separate issue from child support.  Go to the child support enforcement agency in your city and take all the info you have with you.  You can file there without a lawyer.|`|a1487da8aa66c8ff52fe7d8f2926affdaa	You should still be able to get child support unless the rights of the other parent were terminated. I have sole legal and physical custody of my daughters and my ex was ordered to pay child support. he hasn't but that is another story. call child support services in your area.|`|D6kwriPxaa	That should have been resolved in the divorce proceedings.
WCkOUF9aaa	All we know about Jesus is written in a book with questionable stories in it.|`|SJTD3Ocxaa	Actually, Jesus w/ the long straight hair is a European invention......he lived in the middle east, where people usually are dark skinned and have black hair/brown eyes.  But yeah, he said love thy neighbor, too bad that there are so many who claim to be Jesus followers that still haven't figured that message out......|`|fSlZQzS4aa	We don't know.  There are no contemporary pictures.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Yes, yes he was.|`|URO3gDXcaa	yes he was.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	He probably didn't have long hair.  The fashion at that time was actually for shorter hair.  The long hair and flowing robes in a concoction of the Middle Ages.  Jesus was actually quite conservative, desiring nothing more than for people to live by the rules God gave the Jews through Moses, nothing more, nothing less.  He absolutely did not argue for the dissolution of the family or establishment of communes.  He did not revolt against the government.  In fact, one of his more famous sayings was to "Give Caesar his due".<br>  <br>  Jesus ate and drank what all Jews at the time ate, wine, water, bread, fish, lamb, and beef when it was available.  The conception of Jesus as some sort of weird hippy guy is based on the off the wall movies that have been made about him over the last 40 years or so.  Since those movie makers were mostly hippies, or at least were influenced by that movement, he was portrayed as such.  Those bear little resemblance to reality.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	LOL, isn't that ironic that Jesus, who the religious right love so much, is from a group of people they hate (a jewish hippy)|`|W0VL46gDaa	no. Hippies smoke pot and have casual sex and wear peace signs.<br>  <br>  Jesus said himself he did not come to bring us Peace. <br>  <br>  And there are no scriptures or pictures that show he had as long of hair as people think.
YTJ5Upneaa	This is the plan that Bush already had before he left office, but now Obama will take credit for finally getting the troops out of Iraq. He is not doing it as fast as Pelosi and Reid want him to though. If you look at the situation there it has been stabilizing ever since the surge. I guess Obama will take credit for that to, but wait didn't he vote against the surge?|`|TItRpckpaa	He is a politician, he lied during his campaign preaching change and then once in office did the same old ****.

After the election GWB signed an agreement that Obama is going to honor. so lets see, 16 months to 18 months and keeping our word to another country. I am very certain that if he pulled us out by June 2010 you'd be in a hissy because he wasn't honoring the agreement Bush signed.<br>  Let it go, hate will eat you up.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	If he doesn't remove ALL the troops by end of this year, it will be Obama's war from there on out.|`|IUw5Z395aa	Yes, he broke his promise--why can't he be like Bush, and fixate himself upon one goal, while ignoring whatever new developments that take place during the course of his presidency|`|ipWRgKetaa	It is no different from the Bush plan, but take heart.

w8QUHh7faa	In the long run the theory is that the MAC will save you money, even though the cheapest one is $800-$1000.  You don't have to worry about viruses as much for MACs as you do PCs so you end up spending money every year updating your virus program.  <br>  As far as the Office argument, Microsoft makes Office software for MACs so you don't have to worry about not being able to bring your files home but that's kind of moot point since the military is not allowing any use of USB flash drives but you can email all your stuff to and from work & home.<br>  A PC notebook can start from $300 and up.  What you'll need it for mainly is probably just to check email, surf the web, some Office work, maybe for watching movies but that will grow old quick.  <br>  A MAC is consider best for people who will doing alot of graphics work with pictures and movies.  Plus all the stuff a PC does.<br>  <br>  Either choice you won't be able to take the laptop to your work center and hook up to the wireless.<br>  <br>  One more item about the Office program, wait til you get to your first duty station and get your .mil email to order it.  Microsoft has a discount for military folks and we only have to pay $19.95 plus shipping for it.  Good luck.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	The AF has nothing to do with what kind of computer to buy.<br>  <br>  Only you know what you like to do on a computer.<br>  <br>  IE: just e-mail, web surfing, or playing HALO<br>  <br>  You can buy a good laptop for as little as $600, but don't expect to play high end graphic intensive games on it.<br>  <br>  PC or Apple, it doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Which ever one you like the best.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	A PC using Windows.  They use Windows so it might be hard to switch back and forth.  I had a MAC and it drove me nuts trying to remember the commands for each computer.  You have to stop and think instead of it being automatic.  I would get a Toshiba.  While some can cost $3,000, there are also those that are around $800 and are great.  Fast, clear screen, high quality.  I know of some people who buy a laptop and a year later they are replacing the LCD (usually right after the warranty runs out).  The screen can be really expensive.<br>  <br>  Look for sales.  Even Walmart will put Toshibas on sale but you have to be fast as they usually only have one or two per store.  My last choice would be a Dell.  They have numerous issues with their hard drives and while they will replace them, your data is lost if it crashes.<br>  <br>  One other word of advice.  The Air Force uses Powerpoint like it is the only program available.  But Publisher is also very handy for anyone in the military and it doesn't come bundled with Office anymore.  Go ahead and buy that separately.  You won't regret it.|`|htaxf1jJaa	A PC would probably be easier because a MAC requires different types of whatever you would have to download or something, it would require a different setting in order to download it if you needed it for the Air Force. Gateway laptops are good and affordable, my brother has a Gateway and he is in the Marines and he likes it. Also if you want you can get an affordable laptop with a webcam and mic installed in it so it would be easier to keep in touch with family and friends and what not.|`|xjdmXkqHaa	there are lots of computers at work. So you laptop would be for personal use. If you need a laptop for work then you will get one from inventory. <br>  air force uses Microsoft not mac.

ZkaQl2Nvaa	To elaborate on Peter's reply.<br>  <br>  Rather than a majority (which indicates over 50% of the votes), FPTP works on a plurality, which is simply whoever gets more votes, whether it is one more or a hundred is the winner.<br>  <br>  Proportional Representation allocates seats (so for use in multi-seat elections, such as general elections, it would however get rid of constituencies, as they do not work with a PR system) in proportion to the votes cast.<br>  <br>  For example: Labour 35% of the vote, 35% of the seats go to Labour.<br>  <br>  Conservatives: 99.999999% of the seats ( a little prediction for the next election :P) so 99.999999% of the seats go to the Tories.<br>  <br>  You get the idea.<br>  <br>  This does however create a weak government, which would struggle to react as quickly to events as a government in a FPTP system.|`|AA12355761	First past the post in elections means that the candidate with the most votes is the winner with a "majority" over the the candidate with the second most votes, even though they may win with much less than 50% of votes cast.This system pertains in the UK parliament.<br>  In a proportional representation contest, seats in the parliament or council will normally be allocated from a list of candidates in line with the percentage of votes cast for each party.

If she is caught, she is subject ot deportation and being denied for 10 years.<br>  <br>  You married an illegal alien criminal and created a family with her that now has this cloud over its head.  It's a bad situation no question--but be clear that it is one of your own making.  The children are the ones who are likely to suffer the most if she's caught and deported.  My suggestion to you is you and the whole family return to Mexico with her.<br>  <br>  I am not a racist or a bigot and my answer has nothing to do with your wife's ethnicity.  It has EVERYTHING to do with your wife's Criminal Behavior.|`|a57f3452d9ef1f62cbcc55c95fd107c3aa	You file I-130 if she is already in US. <br>  <br>  K-3 is Non immigrant spouse visa when the spouse reside outside of US. <br>  <br>  However, even if your I-130 is approved, she has to go back to Mexico to complete the process, if she does not have any leagal status currently in US. Without status, she cannot file I-485 to Adjust her status. Sorry.|`|wnWIxb9maa	How about honest Americans?<br>  <br>  Have her go home and come here legally.  That isn't racist, it's the law.  There shouldn't be anything that can keep her here.  My mother-in-law died waiting for a legal visa, what makes your old lady better than her, besides coming here as a criminal.  My step son has waited almost 11 years.  I am sick of you illegal lovers wanting something extra, damn you all to hell.|`|Ca8i226Xaa	Send her back to Mexico and have her legally enter the USA. Also, don't insult people who disagree with an American marrying an illegal alien. Some people think that that is treasonous. You know, consorting with the enemy!|`|L8dI9SwDaa	The first important question is: was she inspected by an immigration official when she entered the US? If yes, she doesn't have to leave!<br>  <br>  Your wife submit the I-130 along with I-485, I-765,I-864, G-325. She is requesting adjustment of status based upon marriage to a US citizen. Upon approval, in these cases only, any out of status time is forgiven if the applicant entered the country legally. Since she did enter the country legally, she is allowed to file to adjust her status from a non-immigrant to an immigrant based upon marriage to a US citizen. Definitely file the I-765 Employment Authorization request! These are generally approved within 90 days of filing. <br>   She may want to avoid filing the I-131 or at least have that issue reviewed.<br>  <br>  If you want to petition her children you can do that on separate files for each ones. It is very costly and moreover she needs medical exams too(shoots, blood tests, etc)<br>  <br>  Congratulation!!<br>  <br>  **************** DO NOT do what the guy above me said UNLESS she came to the USA withouth a visa ! You'll be wasting your money and risking your wife's deportation.<br>  <br>  If you file the I-130 it comes back usually within a few weeks with a reply was it accepted or not. The continuance depends on this answer.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to seek an experienced immigration attorney.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	Well it may not seem fair or appropriate but a judge can pretty much say what he wants to say and talk as long as he wants; in the courtroom he's pretty much the only authority. But if the judge was just being witty and cracking jokes he's probably allowed to do that. I've seen judges do and say some pretty bizarre things.<br>  <br>  However, if he really says something offensive or inappropriate you can file a complaint and he can be disciplined -- where you file the complaint varies by state, but typically there is a commission on judicial ethics or something similar, which is run by the state's supreme court.<br>  <br>  Think carefully -- do you want an angry judge handling your case? If the case is all done and you won't have to deal with this judge again no problem. If you want to get the judge off your case you should talk to your lawyer.|`|vUiUoamVaa	That, in my opinion, is totally inappropriate.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	I heard of a case where the judge held up a pen and said to the defendant that "I am about to throw this, if you can catch it I will send you home on probation, if not then you will have to go to prison."  Then he threw the pen over his shoulder to the floor behind him.<br>  <br>  I thought that was pretty funny.<br>  <br>  As Berretta used to sing, "don't do the crime if you can't do the time"

He is trying to destroy the constitution, even more than Bush did. When we can actually look past party affiliation and look to what will hurt and help this country is when things could start to get better. I did not believe in many of Bush's policies, but I also do not agree with what Obama, Pelosi, and Reid are doing. They are trying to turn this country into a welfare nation where the haves are forced to pay for the have nots. Is this the "economic justice" Obama wanted. When will people realize that taking away the incentive to become successful, by taxing the "wealthy" to death will only hurt this country.|`|KtJmEx1zaa	I think you probably wouldn't understand reasonable when you heard it. Obama's plans are worse than idiotic, they are pretty much diabolical. Chicago politics brought to the White House and threatening the entire country. We will be lucky to get out of this with a whole country, without a lot of killing.<br>  <br>  Remember, when Hitler was taking over Germany the people who went with the flow thought those complaining and warning of what was to come, were just crazies. Now they don't even want to talk about it they are so embarrassed by how idiotic they were. Anything the Nazi's made is illegal to own or sell. To bad they didn't look out past their mob mentality, supported by the press like this one, and see things from a more clear perspective. <br>  <br>  But this Ain't Germany, and Obama ain't Hitler, and We, those in the US who are usually to busy with every day life to act like idiots in the street like democrats, won't take it ... remember that.|`|98EXXItdaa	Is it even legal for a liberal to use the word reasonable?  Seriously, I'd keep that kind of talk to yourself, the glorious leader Obama does not like when his followers use logic or reason, even if it is to talk about somebody else.

0UV0PwDLaa	It's wrong to kill another person.<br>  <br>  Some say war is the same as the death penalty, it is not.<br>  <br>  I will use a grocery store example.<br>  <br>  Lets say there is a man in a store, with a gun. He has killed a woman already.<br>  <br>  A group of men get together and tackle him, and disarm him. He has a chance of death when they tackle him, because they try to hit him head first-this is war<br>  <br>  A group of men tackle the man, and disarm him. He survived getting tackled, and is helpless on the floor. The men decide to point the gun to his head, and kill him-this is the death sentence<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  Also, to purple sparks- DNA evidence has cleared people of crimes after they got the death penalty, and while they were on death ro and while they had life sentences.<br>  <br>  Would you be concerned about your money if you were falsely accused, and want to be killed as soon as possible, before you could appeal your case? What if your child was guilty?<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  to cbrown- I think it results in more killings. How many times do you hear on the news where someone shoots a lot of people, then kills themselves? They figure they'll die anyway, so why not take as many with them as possible? also, isn't life in prison and shame enough of a deterrent?<br>  <br>  Also, killing someone isn't like stealing a cookie. If someone is willing to kill another person, they're logic is obviously flawed, or they have nothing to lose. The death penalty won't make a difference.<br>  <br>  finally, the death penalty is still killing. How many people had good reasons for murdering someone in their minds? If we support this, we're just as bad.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  To leyroy-I assume your a Christian, I am too. The bible clearly states THOU SHALT NOT KILL. You are right, people do horrible things to other people, but have you not done a horrible thing to another person? It may not be illegal, but in God's eyes, you deserve DEATH.

AA11570618	I believe it first came up on "Larry King Live" when Perot was asked if he'd run for President.   -RKO-   03/07/09<br>  <br>  P.S. By the way, Perot would have made a great President. I had the privilege of meeting him in a small gathering of his volunteers at Purdue University. Without the glare of the TV cameras and lights, Perot answered questions intelligently, and with extraordinary perspective. Too bad the media made him out to be such a buffoon. Any man who can borrow $1,000 from his wife and turn it into billions obviously knows a little something about fiscal management, business integrity, ethics and commitment - unlike the swindling mortage lenders, corrupt politicians, arrogant investment brokers, incompetent bankers, greedy hedge fund speculators and cheating insurance executives of this 'modern' era.  -RKO-|`|O5KOwhovaa	America's Funniest Presidential Candidates.

Besides Israel, which is of course not an oil rich nation, it's really the only stronghold the US has in the region. That would be the only plausible benefit that I can think of the for the US.

So the idea was to make the US non reliant on Saudi oil, get Iraqi oil back on the market and get the Saudis to take the thumbs out their bums.

Why should we have to give up opportunity that's EARNED rather than distributed evenly? It may seem fair to those with  nothing, but it's not fair to those who bust their limbs to get what they have. It's the poor that want us to distribute the wealth and I disagree with it.

One works really hard and gets an A. Another struggles a bit but still works and gets a C. And the last slacks off and gets an F. In the essence of equality because we don't want the F student to fail, the administrators redistribute everything so everyone, regardless of effort and ability, gets C's.<br>  <br>  A C is a passing grade. Getting straight C's is enough to graduate from high school. If you're fine with that, ok. But I want to do better because I want more out of life and I don't want to be held back by other people's choices.<br>  <br>  If you make it so no one fails, no one really succeeds either.

No one person ( except for leaders) can have more than any other or be paid more than another( except that in reality some people obtain positions of power and do wind up living far better than the masses). <br>  Under socialist systems there is no incentive for any person to work harder, excel, risk his capital ( since there is no capital) or do anything not requirted by the STATE.

It must be coupled with personal responsibility, so if they mess up, they are the ones who go broke. They are responsible for (and/or liable for) cleaning up the mess they made.  <br>  Socialism robs individuals of the option of profiting from their labors (so why work hard and be creative?) and rewards them by not holding them responsible for the harm they create. <br>  Therefor, the Government must take the responsibility for damage or injury, make restrictions on everyone (taking away freedom), and then rob from all of society to clean up the resulting messes. <br>  That is a lot of power and authority in the hands of those few elitist power brokers, and since power corrupts, eventually tyranny results. <br>  You can fill in the blanks once you understand the cause and effect of violating the above listed principles. <br>  Free enterprise beats Socialism every time it is tried.<br>  The USA has voluntary Socialism. It is called INSURANCE. You put your money in a big pool of cash and when someone needs it, it is there (within contractually agreed limits). Everyone hates it, but it is efficient and it works.

Yes... safety is not involved.
1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	Well, yes you can, it sounds like there was a contract (I assume this was verbal, not written down). <br>  <br>  You would file a suit in small claims court because the amount involved is probably pretty small, typically you can file for no more than $2500-5000 depending on the rules in your state. No lawyers are allowed. <br>  <br>  You would have to prove that there was a contract (verbal) and you would have to show how much it cost you that she doesn't fulfill her part of the bargain. Be careful to calculate a fair value because if you make it a huge claim the judges will tend to think you're just out for money and may not believe you much. Probably you should ask the court to order her to pay you for half of the cost of taking everyone for those six months.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, it would be better if they can work this out somehow. Suing someone, even in small claims court will make them a pretty unhappy and unpleasant neighbor.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	A verbal agreement can be upheld in court.  It would be assumed that your mother did not just offer to drive the other children so that would lend her story credibility.  The other woman would most likely say that she never agreed to drive after the 6 months were up.  This is not reasonable or believable.  I think your mother would have a good chance of being believed.<br>  <br>  Your mother would need to calculate the gas and wear and tear on the car for the 6 months, then deduct half as that was the agreement.  Wear and tear should be calculated by whatever mileage is figured at in your state.  In mine, it is $.58 a mile.  Then she can take these estimates to small claims court and sue for that amount plus court costs.  Any time away from work is also recoverable in most states but again, look that up first.|`|vFvI16P7aa	I can't believe that you would even consider suing someone for that.  That's ridiculous.

I'm betting that somewhere along the line, there wasn't a meeting of the minds anyway and you would lose in a court case.|`|011830a2652ee7687c383f5f54db2d13aa	You must prove that the breech of this verbal contract has caused you damage (the total cost you now have to pay for gas and time away from work)..

Its a fact that his election  came about on a wave of populism subscribed too  by the  masses  and despised by a few. I feel its still  in  his  honey moon period -  its still too early into  his  presidency  for this  shinning coat of  populism to have faded away.  <br>  <br>  However it should be  noted  that times  are going to get very difficult in the coming  months even worse  than they are  now, So i think  it will be natural  for people  to look for  people  to  blame  when they loose  their  jobs  homes and comfortable life styles.  Obama being  president will be  an obvious  target,  since he has  said things  which offer  hope to  the  masses  and  yet lack any credibility or ability to change  things for  the good. Once this  honey moon period  is over obama  will  become  just has unpopular as  any other  president.|`|kwWiMrmgaa	No, you're not wrong. The people who are paying attention are the ones disliking him. See, we have extreme left-wing wackos who thought Obama was the savior. We have more to the middle Democrats who don't really pay attention and thought Obama was just a regular old-school Democrat. We had people on the fence. Then we had conservatives who were actually paying attention and questioning the things people SHOULD question when looking at a presidential candidate (his past choices, associations, accomplishments or lack thereof, etc). Anyone speaking out against Obama was told that none of those things matter. Keep in mind, we really knew nothing about this man and still don't but the media was absolutely in love with him. Of course we also had loyal Republicans who didn't' really know much and went around saying stupid useless things about him, which invalidated all the legitimate anti-Obama points.<br>  Now that he is in office, the people who were on the fence or are reasonable and have at least a little bit of awareness of what's going on, are growing more and more unhappy with him. Our government has no money so what does he do? He proposes and shoves down our throats a trillion dollar stimulus bill. Here's some of what's in the bill - keep in mind, most Americans don't have a clue what's in it:<br>  $650 million for digital TV coupons<br>  $34 million to renovate the Department of Commerce headquarters<br>  $850 million for Amtrak, a train that hasn't turned a profit in 50 years<br>  $160 million for paid volunteers at the Corporation for National and Community Service for the community volunteers<br>  $88 million to help move the Public Health Service into a new building, not for a new building - to help them move to a new building<br>  This is a very small portion of the crap in the bill. There is billions of dollars of wasteful spending.<br>  Again, OUR GOVERNMENT IS BROKE so they are printing worthless money and will then bury us in taxes in order to pay for this GARBAGE.<br>  How do you spend your way out of debt? Does that make sense to anyone with half a brain? Now, in spite of our president's promises about the bill (he told us we "may not survive" if it wasn't passed IMMEDIATELY), we are sinking into a depression. And congress has yet another spending bill on the table- this one is $800 billion.<br>  Would YOU be happy with him?<br>  <br>  Note: we have millions of stupid people who have no knowledge of history and can't see where we're headed for economic slavery.|`|x3D2BUMEaa	Yup you are wrong.

Even some McDonald's use them too. About people sitting around and watching them, I can't give you an answer to that. But most likely they have a "security room" and the tapes just run. There's a major shopping mall in my city and they have a security booth/center right in the middle of the mall.

I will get numerous thumbs down for this but that never changes my opinion.<br>  <br>  As far back as the 70s, researchers were saying that crime goes down when people are able to get legal prescriptions for their addictions.  Their usage goes down as well.  The UK has done this for years.  I saw a documentary and one woman told her story of a life of crime with heroin.  After she was able to get a script for it, she cut her usage down to a quarter and was married with children.  She said that as long as she could remember, something felt missing inside her.  With a low dosage of heroin, she felt normal, not high.<br>  <br>  It has been proven that the brains of addicts don't function the same as non-addicts.  They don't release enough dopamine and not enough serotonin uptake.  I believe it should be treated as any other medical condition.<br>  <br>  The issue is that most people have never taken the time to research these alternatives (you have).  They only see junkies commiting crimes and feel they should just stop abusing the drugs as if it was that simple.  There is a reason that current treatment (12-steps, etc) only help about 18% of addicts.  We need other solutions.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I have done my homework.  In fact, I have taken advanced botany along with being an addiction counselor at one point.  I do know what I am talking about.  Mushrooms from the southwest states for example, are lethal at small doses.  Yes, there are certain strains that are more benign but you didn't include a species name, just "magic mushrooms."  <br>  <br>  Please stick to facts, not insults.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	One big problem, "you" are assuming their desire to "save" the country.

You will get fit very quickly and that can confuse the body greatly.  However, if you do get it, you get no extra breaks, they still yell at you to hurry up.  You will have to keep a little black folder with you that holds all materials needed for the day, like pens and pencils for class, and for women that would be the needed pads or tampons.  You are also allowed to have medication for cramps, but you will have to tell your TI ( training instructor) and get to sick call to get a medicine pack, which includes the Military basic Vitamin M ( Motrin)  I also hate tp tell you this, but there is definitely NO extra time for Hygiene, you will have to be quick to smell good, and probably go to bed with wet hair for the first week or two.

esgR6ayzaa	Pig odor is a localized air quality problem. It has low concentrations of these potent odorous gases such as p-cresol, and those are not necessarily immediately dangerous to our health. However, odor problems are often a starting point for litigation. This is a real problem for many farmers large and small, but small operations in particular can go out of business because of this litigation. This is a real issue to many people. The need to do fundamental research on odor, on controlling odor, and on gaseous dust emissions from livestock is still there.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	I just love all the uneducated, non/anti-scientific questions and answers here.<br>  <br>  If you ever lived near a pig farm, even MILES downwind, you'd know that pig shlt STINKS, as well as containing methane, which is 20 times more polluting than carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as being extremely volatile (combustible, flammable). In addition, pigs in those factory-farms produce prodigious amounts of poop... what do the farmers do with it? Most of them build holding tanks which are basically open-air dams with millions of gallons of liquid poop fermenting in the sun.<br>  <br>  South Carolina has more pigs than people. Several years ago, one of those poop-dams broke, releasing millions of gallons of poop into a local river. One of the problems is that the pigs produce poop faster than it can be used for fertilizer, etc. Now switch to Iowa, which has the largest number of pigs of any American state. Every time you eat bacon, ham or pork chops, you are contributing to that problem (not to mention the atrocious conditions that those factory-farm pigs are raised in).<br>  <br>  What all these anti-scientific attitudes reflect is an unwillingness to acknowledge that city-folks literally don't know shlt about farm animals, waste storage and disposal, toxic gases, fertilizer production, water and air pollution; basically: agronomy, husbandry, economics, finance, research, resource utilization, etc etc etc.<br>  <br>  They also seem to forget that this budget was crafted mostly under the jurisdiction of Dubya's last year in office. Also, $8 billion in earmarks out of $400+ billion is 2%... now you're being nit-picky.

uFTO5rs8aa	The real question you should ask yourself is where is all this cash going to?  AIG is an insurance company so the only way they could lose money is from bad investments in their own portfolios or if their policyholders are entitled to and using their insurance.<br>  <br>  Guess who some of their main policyholders are...?<br>  <br>  Wait for it....<br>  <br>  Banks!!  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123638394500958141.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12363839...</a><br>  <br>  Turns out top US and European banks cashed in on $50 billion from AIG.  That's over 1/3 of the money AIG got in bailout money.|`|AA10079277	As of now, Obama has raised the number of people in the US that don't pay taxes to 50%.  Very scary.  That means 50% of the entire population has no stake in how much money the government spends.  Since it does not cost them a dime, they have no incentive to get the government to live within their budget.  Be ready for far more waste and more thrown at the banks.

pcHp7Dgkaa	Although the USA doesn't encourage dual citizenship, it does allow and recognise it and Australia has no problem at all with the concept and has millions of dual citizens. You will be able to have both once you qualify and apply for Australian citizenship which you can do after living here for 4 years after your Australian spouse visa is issued. You must make it clear at that time that you do not intend giving up your US citizenship so make sure you don't check any wrong boxes or make any conflicting statements.<br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1753.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw...</a><br>  <br>  Your wife won't automatically get US citizenship until you go through the process of petitioning for a US spouse visa for her in much the same way as she has sponsored you for your Australian visa. I think you could possibly get a spouse visa for her from Australia but I know she can't qualify for citizenship if she doesn't live in the USA for several years after being granted her green card.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Marriage alone will not qualify either one of you for each other's citizenship. There are residency requirements.<br>  <br>  In order for her to apply for US citizenship, you have to live in the US, she then has to get a greencard, and only after meeting the residency requirements can she apply for citizenship<br>  <br>  If you wanted to become an Australian citizen, you would need to live with her in Australia for at least 4 years before you could apply for citizenship<br>  <br>  Neither of you would have to give up your own citizenship to get the other's. She can be Australia-US and you can be US-Australian|`|1EhbLBkUaa	No.  To be a US citizen, you must renounce other citizenships.  She could apply to be a legal resident in the US, if that's where you will be staying, and still keep her Australian citizenship, but she would have to pick one or the other: keep Australian citizenship, or apply to be a US citizen and renounce the Australian.  It appears that Australia doesn't require this, but the US does.<br>  <br>  The other way around, for you, I'm not sure.|`|HwoV5nDTaa	there are some countries that put restrictions to having another citizenship, like china or korea for example, but this is not the case of the USA nor Australia, as an american citizen you can have as much citizenships as you want, but if you want the chinese for example, you can't, it's the country whom you want the citizenship that may refuse you to have dual citizenship, but america has no problem with that and Australia either, so yes you can make this work for you and your wife, i have duel citizenship, american and moroccan cause i am married to an american.
vFvI16P7aa	Depends on what your definition of "beat" is.  You can discipline children, and you can discipline your pets.  Where the law draws the line is at INJURY.  You can't leave marks or use objects, etc.  Dog peed on the floor, smack its butt.  No harm in that.

pedE84Hbaa	Is gun control going to stop gang members from getting guns or drug dealers giving up their guns? Also has gun control stopped gang shootings or innocent civilians getting shot or being killed from gang violence? No! and authoritiess don't even know how many guns drug dealers or gang members have.|`|W0VL46gDaa	It's not.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Because, it is hard to consistantly hit who your shooting at,<br>  <br>  If you do not have good gun control.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you tend to spray rounds , all over the place.|`|03ef1467aed1253e530bac3b2891149caa	What do you mean by gun control? I ask this because people don't agree the meaning of this. Some people believe that gun control means no guns and some people (like me) believe that gun control means more control. <br>  <br>  For me, guns are like diver lincenses: You need skills and you need to be responsible.|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	It is not.

0MeR1C1maa	Taking liberties??   You mean they are squeezing your boobs and stuff?<br>  <br>  Or just changing your schedule?  If that is all they are doing, then I agree, you have an attitude problem.<br>  <br>  As for the union issue, your employer is limited by their contract with the union.  They are not going to breach that contract because you don't want to pay union dues.  Again, sounds like you may have an attitude problem.<br>  <br>  If they are taking liberties with your private parts, though, you should go after them with the EEOC.  I hate it when pervy managers go after my girls!|`|N7G26k4Iaa	To be honest, not much.  As most of the US has an "at will" employment status, you can be fired at any time.  Your only hope is your union but, as you say, it might not be of much use to you.  Sorry.|`|AA12146958	Your company decides what shift workers are needed on.If your union has no problem with it then there really is nothing to do. You refuse to work then you can be fired.
EBw32eQYaa	Every branch has linguists. Chris is totally right with everything he said. If I could do it all over again I would have picked the Navy to be a linguist. Navy linguists for the most part are automatically promoted to E4 when graduating DLI and most where I work make E5 in a few months. So where I work there are E3 airmen doing the same work as E5 navy linguists and taking orders from them and the petty officers have less time in, it's a crappy situation. Army would be a good choice too.|`|2zym4J9xaa	Stick with the Air Force!!!!!<br>  <br>  As for women, these are the best to worst branches to join.<br>  <br>  1- Air Force (best for women)<br>  2- Navy (2nd best for women)<br>  <br>  3- Army (maybe... but this is risky)<br>  <br>  4- Coast Guard (horrible for women)<br>  5- Marine Corps (worst branch for women)|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	I went into the Air Force during the Korean war. They were straight with me and sent me to electronic school.<br>     Good Luck with your choice|`|xjdmXkqHaa	hi there. <br>  1. join the Air Force. Much better than army. Received 1st hand response form army personnel. Worked with all branches. <br>  2. language school is in Monterrey ca. for 2 yrs and you get paid. plus you get language pay and are on Flying status. You do have to do airborne and survival  training as well<br>  3. Depending on what language you choose there are a few requirements. eg. whether its romance language, middle eastern, far east and so on.   I would highly recommend mandarin Chinese or Arabic. A lot of linguist have bachelors to master degree due to their 2 yr schools and then some continue to complete their education on their own as well. <br>  4. its a great opportunity and you should definitely go for airforce. <br>  any questions e-mail me. <br>  <br>  Looks up AFI (airforce operating instructions) on AFSC's (job code) <br>  <br>  yours could be AFSC  1N0X1, Operations intelligence<br>                                    1A8     Airborne Cryptologic Linguist <br>  <br>  There are some cool deployments, travelling, and its a tight nit community, plus the people there JUSTTTTT loooove their job. its exciting.|`|RyFCRcIUaa	The Army also has a linguistic program!|`|fyWbMXOHaa	I do not see a question here. Yes they have a linguistics program, but so does the Army, and probably every other branch.|`|OwQYMMH5aa	All branches have a linguistics program. I'm a CTI3 in the Navy and I attended DLIFLC for the past 70 weeks. DLIFLC (Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center - DLI for short.) is where all career linguists in every branch are stationed and receive their language training. Right now the Navy has the highest pass rate here at DLI but that changes from time to time, from my side, the Navy has the loosest military requirements while stationed here due to the difficulty of the course (some are 63 weeks long). All the other branches constantly have training, some on weekends which is your only time off. They also have a strict "Phase" policy which restricts you from going off base, drinking, driving a car etc. The Navy's "phase" policy is only about 2 weeks long while the air force has many months and the army is way more than that. So if you're set on the Air force , I applaud you joining. There is however linguistic jobs in every force.<br>  <br>  Edit: Most of what Candid LoveBug has said is inaccurate. <br>  1. The school is not for 2 years, there isn't a single course that lasts two years. The longest is technically 63 weeks long but can run 64-65. My links to DLI go into more detail in that area if you are interested. <br>  2. One BIG point I forgot to tell you about...you will need to be able to receive a TS/SCI security clearance. This is no easy feat, there are tons of paperwork, a background investigation, interviews with your friends, parents, teachers etc.  <br>  3. You get language pay when you PASS the final (DLPT). If you don't pass it all counts for nothing, no matter how good you might be. Survival and Airborne are not required, they are for the airmen that will be flying but there are jobs on the ground as well. <br>  4. There is almost a 0% chence that you will get to be in any romance language. Russian linguists are being retrained into Chinese etc. Romance languages are for officers more than 99% of the time. Your "choices" for a language will most likely consist of the following : Chinese (Mandarin there is no Cantonese at DLIFLC) ; Arabic (MSA); Korean; Farsi. As an Air Force linguist you will know before you even get to Monterey what your language is. <br>  5. There is also no one who gets a Bachelors much less a Masters from DLI. It is accredited and you do have the option of an Associates, but that is all. That of course can be put towards a bachelors, etc. <br>  6. I also forgot about the rapid advancement in the Navy. I came in as an E2 and will be an E5 in Sept. None of the other services in my class can say the same. Thanks for reminding me Scuba Steve.<br>  <br>  In closing, I would recommend that you check out the links, and then think about what you want in your military career.|`|2sPWYf5Paa	If you are considering a branch, the AF is the way to go. I have spent 6 years in the Army and have spent my time working with the AF. The fact is they get treated better and are better taken care of out of all the military services. The funding for the AF is out the roof so they have the means to provide top notch quality for their members. "An important thing to keep in mind considering the budget cuts Obama is about to smack down on the military."|`|AA11870648	It's true all branches have a linguistic branch, and the A School is in Monterey, CA.  The Airforce is (in my opinion) one of the best branches to belong to because the others that you will be in that branch with are largely more carefully screened and selected.  It's the nation's "smartest" branch in that sense.  I served in the USN for some time as a linguist in Monterey (Arabic) and loved it.  I would totally recommend your going for it!|`|STHJeNHdaa	You are a female JOIN THE AIRFORCE!!!!

That said, what advice would you give him? For me, i'd advise him to stick to the principles that voters elected him for--transparency, fairness, compassion and honesty, to name a few. I'd also advise him to keep that thick skin he needs to accomplish his goals, as there are many who openly hope he fails, and will complain/criticize his every move.

So the bump & grind, or some other dance moves that look more like they should be performed in the bedroom, can get you thrown in jail without any say-so from a church or other social organization.<br>  <br>  In this way, dancing - at schools - should be along the same lines as those you might see at a church social or old-folks community - lots of movement, not alot of groping and no grinding. Besides which, most schools have rules against "PDA's" - Public displays of Affection, so a little bump-n-grind action could get you in trouble in that way.<br>  <br>  At a school I was at a few years ago, which had a temple attached to it, a few couples got busted and thrown in jail, because they found a really cool place to hook-up - just away from the dance-floor.... otherwise known as the temple's tabernacle. So basically they got brought up on defamation and other charges. <br>  <br>  A local congregant happened to stop by for prayers and was very upset, so you have to keep in mind while looking to hook-up at some level with Mr. or Ms. "Right Now", that not everyone else might be "feeling it" the same way the happy couple certainly is.|`|6B3ojD2Laa	Yes they can. An organized group of parents, like your example of the church people, can pressure the school board quite a lot, especially when it would be embarrassing for the school board to support what they are complaining about.  I remember about 15 years ago, NYC schools super. was in favor of giving out condoms to teens in schools, and religious parents basically drummed him out of his position.  I'm not saying I agree with these "moralizers", but they can have an influence to a large extent.  They wouldn't be able to have a county school system select the Baptist church, for example,  as the preferred religion for the county schools, though.|`|BWlcmjc6aa	Schools can and should be influenced by the communities in which they operate.  A school board holds regular meetings to allow the community to air their opinions about such things as propriety and decency issues.  If your school board has made their decision because of these influences, it is perfectly legal.  Just because someone goes to a church they do not lose their rights to freedom of speech.  And the rule was not spouted at you from a pulpit, it came from those who have authority over you and your dances.|`|epbzW5N8aa	At my daughters school, no dropping it like it's hot, the church has nothing to do with that.|`|JaSIm56Naa	no not legally but they can state what they feel is right but there is this thing called separation of church and state

In fact, the future of the European continent was perceived to depend upon the battle of Waterloo. If Napoleon won, France would have been confirmed as the undisputed master of Europe. If Napoleon was beaten, England would have become the leading power in Europe and greatly expand its sphere of influence. <br>  What Western school children are not taught - for obvious reasons - is the much bigger story behind the official narrative, the story of one of the biggest frauds in human history. Nathan Rothschild, the head of the English branch of the Rothschild crime family, took advantage of his advance knowledge of the outcome of the battle by tricking the London Stock Exchange into believing that Napoleon had won. The resulting crash of the Exchange enabled Nathan Rothschild’s agents to buy the entire London stock market for a Penny in the Pound and seize control of the Bank of England.<br>  <br>  This shameless fraud was ruthlessly repeated in 1929. The private owners of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Rothschild subsidiaries J.P. Morgan, City Bank and Chase Manhattan Bank were awash with money earned by financing World War I. Using their market power, Rothschild’s agents first engineered an artificial boom in the stock market, tricking smaller banks and private investors into putting huge amounts of money into the stock market and then deliberately crashed it, enabling the Rothschild agents to buy most of the U.S. stock market. The ripple effect of the New York crash also enabled Rothschild agents in other countries, such as Germany, to buy local corporations at a fraction of their actual value.<br>  <br>  Eighty years later, it looks like our ruling psychopaths are at it again. They are systematically destroying trust in the U.S. dollar, causing holders of large amounts of green bags to sell them. At the same time, the Rothschild’s are preventing the European Central Bank from printing sufficient Euros for U.S. Dollar owners to exchange all of their holdings into Euros. That way Dollar owners are forced to buy gold instead, causing the gold price to explode.<br>  <br>  Simultaneously, the Rothschild’s are using their influence on the media sector to spread rumours of an imminent crash of the U.S. Dollar and international stock markets. As per usual, in the day and age of infowar, those rumours first started in the alternative Internet based media, only to spread into the mainstream business media. Last week’s ‘global stock and credit market warning’ of the Rothschild owned Royal Bank of Scotland means that the next Waterloo must be imminent. <br>  <br>  All it takes is a trigger such as a thwarted Israeli attack on Iran or the blocking of the Persian Gulf for oil transports, followed by a major stock sell-off by Rothschild agents. Once the world’s stock and credit markets have completely crashed, the price of an ounce of gold will be in the thousands, enabling the Rothschild’s and other owners of large gold holdings to buy the market for a fraction of their true value.<br>  <br>  <br>  Watch the real world history that is kept from you in the education system and the mainstream media.<br>  <br>  PROBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT VIDEO YOU WILL EVER WATCH.<br>  (1)   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ZPGaGngJU " rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ZPGaGng...</a><br>  (2)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj9WCMk_tZ0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj9WCMk_t...</a><br>  (3)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSProh4FBEE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSProh4FB...</a><br>  (4)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CnZW9ZBiY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_CnZW9ZB...</a><br>  (5)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYokW5WYXms" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYokW5WYX...</a><br>  (6)  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGkDZPta-TE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGkDZPta-...</a><br>  (7)  http://w|`|AA11606823	no, and you will never know.  no one will know.  they keep this all secret from everybody.

AA10023092	Yes you can file for bankruptcy. The hospital will be a judgement creditor and they will fall low on the list of creditors who get paid first as they are unsecured.<br>  <br>  This being said, you have to see if you file chapter 7 or 13.  Under 7 when all is said and done all of your debt will be discharged.  However, secured property may be taken and sold along with any non-exempt property you may have. However most states have generous exemption laws so unless you have a whole bunch of stuff you will get to keep a lot.  You have to qualify to file for chapter 7.<br>  <br>  <br>  Under chapter 13 they will calculate a payment plan based on income and debt. Once the payment plan is done all debts will be discharged.  Anyone can file chapter 13. <br>  <br>  Of course before a bankruptcy judgemetn is rendered a lot of negotiation happens etc<br>  <br>  But to really answer your question yes you can file bankruptcy after a civil judgment.  Its kind of the point.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	You can file for bankrupty, but you may still have the paid the hospital bill per ruling of the bankrupty judge|`|AWSmknxLaa	Yes you can file bankruptcy.

He will need to call you.<br>  <br>  Other options:<br>  If there is a DSN phone, he can call for free to a stateside base and they can transfer the call to your home number (totally free).  The drawback is that it uses an official phone and he may not have access depending on his duties.<br>  <br>  Use email and IM on the computer -- free.

However, cell phone reception in iraq is spotty at best and VERY expensive if roaming from a carrier here in the states. depending on which camp he's stationed at over there he should have access to internet which would be a much more reliable way to communicate and a lot less expensive. but if he were to bring a cell phone, i would recommend a blackberry with an unlimited BB international plan. most providers offer the unlimited plan for around $65 dollars which include unlimited data and email. so you could connect with him with aol instant messenger or email and it wouldnt cost you more than the $65.

EoCadP7kaa	The U.S. has one of the strictest immigration systems int he world. A Permanent Resident can apply for United States citizenship, or naturalization, after five years of residency. Permanent Residents may submit their applications for naturalization as much as 90 days before meeting the residency requirement. If you have a green card, there is no point in applying for a student visa. Student visas don't lead to citizenship. You can be a student in America for 5yrs and you wouldn't qualify for PR or citizenship. The children can get a dependent visa. The V-2 dependent visa is a nonimmigrant visa which allows the foreign national children of a U.S. Permanent Resident to enter into the U.S. and await the availability of an immigrant visa. If you apply for a student visa, or any visa, you may be required to return to Mexico, and apply from your home country. When applying for a student visa, you are generally required to show proof of funds. Being as xenophobic as America is, you may be required to show proof of $10 000, or more. Foreign students are generally required to show the ability to support themselves. If the U.S. immigration finds out that the student stayed in USA undocumented, then the visa (dependent, or student) may be refused.|`|2RPXJ6y7aa	I would not even worry about the laws, just do whatever you want and it someone questions you, you bark off Native Americans and then use that false Mexican version of history to defend your crime.

AA11494150	They will be sending you a "civil demand". They can sue you for up to three times the cost of the stolen items, plus reasonable court costs. If you took $160, it is possible they will demand $500, or even more. <br>  <br>  If you pay it, no further action will be taken. If you do not, they will file a lawsuit in small claims court, and the matter will then become public record. This means it will be available to prospective employers that do a background check. <br>  <br>  Your friend will not go to jail, lying to Urban Outfitters is not a crime. However, they may have to file additional paperwork because of it, so they will add the extra court costs to the civil demand amount.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	The worst that can happen is your parents finding out.

But I have never heard of any store doing this so this must be something some what new.<br>  <br>  As far as I know of you shouldn't have to go to court because there was never a report made.
8hAhmlJjaa	Television and movies are for entertainment purposes only, they are not what the job truly involves.  But, if you still want to know more about how to become an undercover officer?  Then here goes.<br>  <br>  Apply to a police academy, or get hired by a police department that will send you to an academy.  Get the training.  Work the street as a beat cop in uniform for a while 3 to 5 years, do an exceptional job, get recognized by your supervisor who will recommend you for transfer to a detective unit.  Once an opening comes up in the undercover unit, request the transfer.  <br>  <br>  As to the type of job it really is, consider this.  It is hours of boredom broken up by moments of terror.|`|AA11494150	A&E has a show called "The Rookies", it is the only cop show I've seen that is close to reality.<br>  <br>  As far as doing undercover work, you are going to have to get a job as a patrol officer first. You will not be allowed to do undercover work until you get a firm understanding of police work.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	No, you do not "really like the job" what you like is the TV show. They are not based on reality, in fact in many cases about as far from reality as it is possible to get. Police work is far more mundane - is a job, an often difficult and unrewarding job - it isn't a life of excitement. It can certainly offer a great deal for many people, but only those who truly understand what Policing is about.

If you don't have standing, the court cannot hear you.)<br>  <br>  A tenant DOES have standing to sue his landlord for failing to properly deal with a second tenant.  Specifically, a tenant has the right to the quiet enjoyment of his property.  If another tenant is engaged in something like drug activity, gang activity, etc. and the landlord has been notified repeatedly of the problem but is refusing to evict the tenant, the other tenant can sue the landlord for civil damages and/or would be allowed to break a least, etc.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Sure you can.

rx7e4Jogaa	Supposedly the most respect is if you enlist and then get a commission, but honestly, the best way to go about it is to just do your job, care about your men, and be the very best that you can, and you will gain the respect of your subordinates, your peers, and your superiors.
tROFU72waa	hahahahahahahahah.........no.  You get the respect we owe the rank and nothing more than that until you show us you deserve to be respected.  A 2nd LT is nothing more than an overpaid private and that's that.  The difference is that a Private knows they don't know anything and seek to learn.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, someone named Obamas bro is going to be so very up on respect.  The recruiter gets the contract credit regardless if your a Warrant contract, ROTC referral, or a direct commission for OCS.  Know the subject before you run your mouth. The recruiter is also a real Soldier that's had to put up with several 2LT's that thought they were God's gift to the military.  He stated his opinion, and I for one as a Soldier and former Marine, second that opinion.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	You are respected for how well you do your job.<br>  <br>  Just having a certain rank, does not get you respect.<br>  <br>  Whther Officer or NCO.<br>  <br>  If you can pay for college now or get a ROTC scholarship, <br>  <br>  Then go to college.|`|SJ11pyCXaa	Respect is earned. When you get to your unit, the enlisted guys and NCOs will pay you the respect of your rank. But, real respect and admiration comes from good leadership, looking out for your platoon, and doing the right thing.<br>  <br>  I've seen prior-enlisted guys who became officers who were absolute dirtbags, clueless, or use their experience of the 'system' to sham out. I've seen some brand new LTs do extremely well. It all depends on the individual. Just never forget, no matter what rank you are, you should continually strive to better yourself and learn more.<br>  <br>  -Army Aviator|`|BImIMnbzaa	There are degrees of respect in the military, particularly amongst company grade officers.<br>  <br>  Those who command the highest respect are generally those who graduated from the Academy IE Annapolis, West Point, AF Academy, The Citadel, etc.   Mustangs are offered a high level of respect as well.  these are people who have come up through the enlisted ranks and then qualify for OCS.  Battle field commissions are considered quite highly as well, although I believe these are becoming less and less.<br>  OCS graduates are or have been quite common in military life, and they enjoy a fair amount of respect too.  I do believe OCS is a step up from the ROTC candidate,but others might argue this point.  <br>  <br>  A new program, at least it's new to me, is students nearing the end of their junior year are being offered a ten week Marine training program during the summer months.  I assume this is the same as OCS at Quantico.  In any case, I believe it allows them to complete their last year of college following this ten week program and upon graduation, they receive their commission as a 2nd lieutenant in the US Marine Corps !<br>  <br>  A|`|xjdmXkqHaa	ROTC just helps you in having prior knowledge on commands and certain things but no, it makes no difference. You might get to lead the flight in marches on basic training (holding the flag) but that's it. <br>   There is no extra "respect" . That is only earned after you sign that contract and serve your time (things you do and achieve). You can gain respect by three core values -- integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do<br>  I would recommend joining USAF. <br>  <br>  Also, Officers get better pay and get saluted by Enlisted in any branch if that's the respect you want.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	Enlisted folks don't like officers regardless of where they came from. It's been that way from day one. The ones that tell you the best officers were enlisted are full of it. That's what they think. Any officer who does his job, learns from those who are experienced and sticks to their guns will earn respect. Inexperienced 2LT's in combat? They seemed to do fine in every war including the current one. <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor, go to college and get your commission. Ignore these morons. You'll see what I mean in about 4 years.|`|KZh3x4g9aa	you should report that piece of sh*i*t,all he was trying to do was keep his recruiting numbers up.I have a serious problem with assholes like that.did 6 years in the military and the morons are there.go ROTC and you will come out 2nd LT. you will have the rank,the respect you will have to earn  by your leadership talents.|`|2sPWYf5Paa	I have spent 6 yrs in the Army, I have been under many different commands. The best, and most respected officers I have ever worked with have been prior enlisted. They can relate to the lower enlisted because they have been there, that is important for a leader. The biggest problem with officers that come from ROTC is the fact that they have no experience at the basic levels of being a solider. Yes you may get the same generic basic training, but not at the experience level of the PVT that has spent his time as a team member performing at a real unit. Many officers out of ROTC don't know the job at that level, yet they lead the unit at the top. Anyone with sense can see that can be a problem. Do yourself a favor, if you want to be a "good" leader do a three year enlistment, get the experience, and you will make better decisions as a officer.|`|UCNPFSw8aa	Most Enlisted personnel respect experience and hard work. A newly commissioned 2nd Lt. straight from ROTC is seen as green around the gills. If you ask a soldier who is deployed in hostile territory who he would rather have covering his back, a 2nd.

xjdmXkqHaa	yes and i would recommend USAF instead. <br>  <br>  USAF passing ASVAB score to enter the service is higher than any branch. Fact!|`|93r3nCM1aa	It really depends on the breakdown of sections I think. <br>  <br>  My husband got a 70 overall, and on each section he scored high enough to qualify for any job he wants (for the Marines)<br>  <br>  He got 110 on CL, 120 on GT, MM 119, EL 114 and when we were looking over the jobs and their requirements, he qualified for everything. <br>  <br>  It depends on the branch though. Some MOS jobs have a CL requirement of 110, other have a GT requirement of 90...each branch has their own academic standards and ASVAB score requirements. <br>  <br>  But a 74 is pretty good. The average score is like a 35. So I think you could pretty much do anything with a 74.|`|vOJIHqSpaa	A 74 is a really good score... as mentioned above you should be able to get any job you desire.  Word to the wise: Choose smartly you will more than likely only get this one chance...<br>  <br>  GL and stay Army|`|wfhKy3jpaa	You will qualify for most if not all MOS. A 74 is a good score.|`|UCNPFSw8aa	a 74 is a pretty decent score. You could get into the USAF with that score.

In the US, the owner of the store has the right to detain someone who steals from the store (they can do this through their security guards).  Would be very easy to get convicted of this because you went in, ordered food, and never had money with you, so wouldn't be hard to show that you never intended to pay.<br>  <br>  The Cop or prosecutor had the discretion to either seek charges or not.

Now THAT is a good story.<br>  <br>  I do not know what to do, you got a bit of cash about it, I don't think there is anything to be legally done - unless you wish to press charges against the Mall Cops.<br>  <br>  If you wish to do so, call your local police dept. and ask them to come over since you wish them to check you over; and tell them the events that happens prior. They will most likely send some cops over, and take photos of your bruises for evidence against the cop. I think the manager of the restaurant is up to something; not sure. Get him checked out if you agree. I do not know if you would win in court, but hopefully if you do all three of them Mall Cops will get done, they seem very inhumane. <br>  <br>  Other than that you can pass the story to your mates and have a good ol' chuckle about it.

I would, however, speak with the manager of the mall and security.  <br>  As the RCMP stated, there was not enough to arrest or charge you for the offence.  You did not even attempt to leave yet.  For reference, the section of the Criminal Code dealing with this incident would be section 364. (1) Every one who fraudulently obtains food, a beverage or accommodation at any place that is in the business of providing those things is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction. <br>  <br>  Presumption<br>  (2) In proceedings under this section, evidence that the accused obtained food, a beverage or accommodation at a place that is in the business of providing those things and did not pay for it and <br>  (a) made a false or fictitious show or pretence of having baggage,<br>  (b) had any false or pretended baggage,<br>  (c) surreptitiously removed or attempted to remove his baggage or any material part of it,<br>  (d) absconded or surreptitiously left the premises,<br>  (e) knowingly made a false statement to obtain credit or time for payment, or<br>  (f) offered a worthless cheque, draft or security in payment for the food, beverage or accommodation,<br>  is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof of fraud.<br>  The only two that would pertain to you in this incident would be 2(d) and (e).  Not only did you not leave the premises surreptitiously, you spoke with the manager about the situation.  You also did not make a false statement to obtain credit. <br>  <br>  This is a straight summary offence anyway, meaning that if Police did feel there was enough to charge you, they still could not arrest you.  They would issue you an appeance notice.  It is a very minor offence. <br>  I can't believe the officer paid for you though.  Lucky you.<br>  <br>  ETA- security does have the authority to arrest you on behalf of the owner of the property if an offence has been committed <br>  (as per section 494(2) of the Criminal Code, Any one who is<br>  (a) the owner or a person in lawful possession of property, or<br>  (b) a person authorized by the owner or by a person in lawful possession of property<br>  may arrest without warrant a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence on or in relation to that property)<br>   however, they should know what the requirement is for the charge before they start arresting people.   If they knew this section of the Code, they would have known not to arrest you.<br>  PS- I wouldn't go back to Smitty's anyway (I assume that is the "Denny's type" restaurant.  ;)|`|E5zDdQ4raa	You could sue for "unlawful detention".<br>  <br>  Edit: Mhmmd (I think that's your user name).

It seems as though the UK never dares to disagree with American policies which confuses me. I'm proud to be British (in an era where I feel I should look over my shoulder before I proclaim this) and keen to see British politicians take a firm stance on issues which affect the British people. <br>  I don't think the exchange of gifts should enter into the equation. I couldn't care less who gave who the best present, especially in countries where no one else could care less either.<br>  With regards to the so called 'special relationship', I find this concept absurd. We are all independent states and any decision made by a statesman should be in the interest of the people of that state. Obviously it can be complicated but the means should always have this objective as the end result. Those positions don't exist as an ego boost.<br>  I feel this 'special relationship' is increasingly breeding resentment towards America among the general public and this is in no small part due to British politicians appearing afraid to contradict US policies.  <br>  <br>  No country is a charity and nor should they be.|`|5voFMvonaa	yes most countries that have had dealings with U.S. have been destroyed take for example the difference between Haiti (very desperate under military type rule)and Cuba the neighbor who have resisted american or corporate invasion.(near paradise)|`|kGld130yaa	"Poor old Gordon flew down to Washington at short notice only to be treated like a second class citizen".<br>  <br>  <br>  Now he knows how we feel!|`|JhC6BvPpaa	Brown nose would have been best not going and grovelling to those fools.

I'll probably join it. Currently, UK politics and the mainstream parties are thirty years out of date.
3caq6SFxaa	I guess I am the odd man out on this.  The military is fairly compensated and the goals of recruiting and retention are being met.  Paying more would be good and I know they would appreciate it and their families but what price to pay?  What ever you pay them comes from the taxpayer and they are taxpayers; raise pay and then raise taxes which cuts their pay.  I am a retired Marine and a Vietnam veteran, a volunteer and not drafted, and am very proud of those who serve but the key is serve.  Pay them  a million dollars a year and it is still not worth dying for.  Joining the service is not a job and not some thing you do for money-if it is then you should not be there.  Rome played with paying the military to keep it loyal and ended with a military that appointed Caesar based on who paid the most.  Service in the military is a commitment to the country and not looking for more money to live well.   Personally I would have liked more then $118.00 a month plus $65.00 combat pay when I was in Vietnam even in 1970 that was not much, would have liked to have made more then $10,000 a year before 1980 when I was an E6 with over ten years in Orange County California and I could have easily; all I had to do was get out and go to work else where and I had opportunity and job offers.  I didn't and many others didn't either.  I served for the love of the Marine Corps and love of my country and not for those things and money but just for those things.  If you would join the military if they paid more or stay if they pay more you are in my opinion little more then a mercenary and I prefer to have a military that understands that having enough to support themselves and their families but not having to be rich or even upper middle class is good enough when you can feel the pride of what you are doing and look at your children and other children and know they are growing up free because of the sacrifice and commitment you have and feel pride in accomplishing for others.  Sure the other people (civvies) might dress better, have it easier, more spending money, more things and drive better cars then me but I fulfilled my duty and made sure them and their parents had the right to do that.  I served with people like me and that thought like me; I would not have liked serving with or feel safe/secure being guarded by some one who  does it for the money.  You want to pay them more then give them the respect they have earned, thank them whether you agree or not with the actions politicians take and never let any one down grade them or their service for political reasons.  Yes they serve now in Iraq and Afghanistan but those are not "Bush did it", they don't die for oil, they are not killers or murderers.  I have heard too much of that here as I heard baby burner and killer addressed to me and my fellow Vietnam veterans-that hurt a lot more then the small pay checks ever did.|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	because your corrupt politicians think they are more worthy of the pay and benefits.

How about when their state side playing poker and doing pushups and not in combat. How about our navy and air force boys when their working the px or painting rusted ships or moping the deck or just watching the radar 8 hours a day. If you look at the pay and benefits that they do get you will soon realize why so many people join the military.<br>  Retire in 20 years with 50 percent of their pay, some as early as 38 years old. 30 years service will get 70 percent at age 48 with life time medical and full Goverment benefits. If you check their pay from a e3 and up you will see that their pay and benefits are far better than the average worker.<br>  Remember, only a very small percentage ever see combat.|`|mULVP4k4aa	I believe so to.

You would have no problem finding a link to the story.|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Thanks JB for the link.  After I read trooper's response, I doubted it but it really happened.  That JB is a smart guy, isn't he? I can understand the convict being dressed normally so they jury isn't swayed or biased by his prison jumpsuite (orange is such a nice color, isn't it).  But this article says that he "slipped from his restraints and even stole a coat".     As to trooopers comment, he must be one of law enforcement people that don't believe anything outside the blue line.<br>  The news and journalism is supposed to given/written from an unbiased point of view - at least in the old days.  That is such a crock of ___.   The last thing in the world the state wants the nation to know is how ineffective and derelict their police force is.  I am surprised that they went on TV asking for help  and 3 weeks after he walked out.<br>  THREE WEEKS.  Do yo know how far someone could go in 3 weeks?

Sorry trooper.  Below is the link to the story.  Yes, it happened.  How?  Only the people in the court know for sure, but my guess would be that the judge ordered the defendant, Cruz, to be dressed in normal clothes and not shackled.  Some judges do this so that the jury will not be swayed by the appearance of the defendant and find him guilty based upon his looks.  <br>  <br>  Yes, someone will be the scape goat on this one.  I would not want to be the officer on duty that day.
8hAhmlJjaa	Hmm, you must be looking for an opinion, so who cares?  lol<br>  <br>  I only post answers to those questions in which I have first hand knowledge, or training.<br>  <br>  As to your PS - Here is the link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/03/05/20090305cruzupdate0305-ON.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2...</a>|`|vUiUoamVaa	thanks for the two points|`|FmYkUfIDaa	Hi,<br>  Naturally, I don't know how other folk deal with questions asked in Yahoo Answers so I can only answer for myself.<br>  <br>  I agree with your conclusions about the first two above.<br>  <br>  To specific questions I generally will do a search, however, frequently there are so many points of view about a topic that it is difficult to know which piece of information will adequately address the question asked. This can also be compounded when the asker doesn't furnish sufficient information in his/her question.<br>  <br>  In that type of situation I often ask suggest that the asker do their own research and select that information which will provide them with information enabling them to complete their assignment/s.<br>  <br>  In my view it isn't always necessary to research a topic to provide an answer. Sometimes all that is required is to bring logic to bear on the problem and then speak your truth. I agree, it would seem more logical to do some research and armed with that information respond to the question asked.<br>  <br>  As to your question: Why would you post an answer? Hopefully because having already invested time in the project there is a natural feeling of trying to help the person who asked the question. Before you say it, I know this is not a helpful answer.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the answer is, 'because people are complex or don't want to admit they don't know the answer???'|`|2HETgiwgaa	I post answers if I already know the answer or if I am able to find the answer through research.  I think people post replies when they don't know the answer either because they think they do, or they're simply on Y!A to entertain themselves, and they don't care if they know the answer or not - maybe just trying to get more points?|`|2JJLYSAKaa	Ha Ha. A friend of mine told me that if they go through the trouble of clicking on their question and it is so dumb or stupid, they will post an answer because they are there.  They gave the analogy of going some place and finding out it was a bathroom, so you might as well take a dump.|`|LoSXjaGXaa	If I don't know the answer off the top of my head, I'll give a vague, or "safe", answer if they fail to put where they are, otherwise I do a quick google search.|`|masYIMRWaa	First : I do think about a possible answer, and if I don't know exactly, I would do a little research before giving a stupid answer.<br>  Second : Some folks just say whatever comes to their mind because they just want to say something to earn 2 points for answering the question, what they will get ? I don't know. Perhaps they don't have anything else to do. <br>  <br>  Oh well ... I try to be helpful and do my best to come up with an appropiate answer.|`|yqN77FBEaa	I only answer questions that I know the answer to without doing any additional research.<br>  <br>  However on some answers where I think the asker might like more information I will do some research so that I can post source information that the asker can look up if he desires more information.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	I only answer questions I know the answer to first hand.  I do tend to look up references for them though.  For example, I will check the Criminal Code for the section that I am discussing.|`|T2WPvUc1aa	When I answer questions, I usually post a link to the appropriate statutes for the state that the person who asked the question is in. If they don't say what state they are in I give them examples of the law in Texas, and advise them to look up the statutes in their state. And you would be surprised at how many little YA trolls give me thumbs down when I actually post links to the appropriate state laws. It seems that a lot of people on YA are immature little teens (in reality or just mentally). Some people ask stupid questions, or just try to stir up trouble with their "questions" which are really biased statements. Personally, I try to give honest answers most of the time. On political issues I do put in my opinion a lot, but so does nearly everyone else on here. I'm entitled to my opinion just as much as, and no more than, the next person. <br>  As some others have said here. A lot of people THINK they know the answers because someone told them that is how it is, but in reality they know nothing. For example, I can't count the number of people who think that the age of consent is the same for all states,  or who think that the police have to read you your Miranda rights at the time of arrest. When in fact, age of consent varies according to state law, and Miranda has to be read before in-custody questioning, not at the time of arrest.<br>  I could go on and on, but I believe there is a combination of people on YA who think they know much more than they do, people who couldn't care less about researching their answers because they are too lazy, and simple adolescent-minded people who get a big thrill out of arguing with other people online.
vjkkQqaGaa	It's sad, but it's probably because rich people can afford much better lawyers.|`|J0YS28Ysaa	most of the rich and elite have high powered lawyers whose sole job it is to keep them out of trouble..(and bury paper trails lol) the lawyers pass their knowledge along to their clients, and when a potentially problematic situation presents itself, the client already knows how to react as to minimize the damage per the instruction received from their attorney. most people do not have the luxury of this knowledge as it is expensive to obtain, and for the most part, does little to benefit people with little to no assets. also, it costs money to get yourself out of jail. most of the poor would rather sit their time out (pay the violation in jailtime) than post the sometime expensive bond money. if the local drug dealer could afford a lawyer, i dont think he would be dealing drugs.|`|MCDRE1ISaa	Rich people have money.

It happens all the time.<br>  <br>  Can you perhaps imagine someone sitting in jail for a week because they cannot post $100 bail?  It happens all the time.<br>  <br>  Does this help to answer your question - and refute the illogical, contrived, boneheaded arguments offered by some others previously - there is no conspiracy, there is no "good or bad" test given at time of booking, there is no political game involved (not all liberals are rich, not all conservatives are poor - often the opposite is true).<br>  <br>  Justice isn't blind...you and others may be though.

UCNPFSw8aa	I took the Computer ASVAB. If you take too long on one question, the monitor will turn red, and a prompter will have to put in his or her password to make it keep going again. There is a timer on the computer that tells you how much time you have left in that section, so just use your time wisely, and if you see you're stuck on one question, and have about 15 more to go in 2 minutes, guess!!|`|93r3nCM1aa	If you spent an equal amount of time on each question, it would average out to about 1 minute per question.<br>  <br>  Some are super easy though so they can be done in about 10 seconds, so for something you're having trouble on, I wouldn't spend more than a minute. If you have to spend more than a minute, you're better of guessing<br>  <br>  Spend less time @ the beginning of the section and more time @ the end since they get progressively harder as you progress through the section.

With the economy the way it is there will be many people who will need aid.<br>  <br>  You will get all the info you need when you apply for the food stamps.  When the twins are born Social Services will tune you into the Well Baby Program.  You will receive every thing you will need for the twins. There is no extra cost involved.  They want to be sure your twins will have a good start in life and receive the necessary foods, formula, milk, etc.  The Well Baby Program is good until the twins reach the ages of five years old.  So you won't need to use food stamps to get your twins off to a healthy start.  That's what the Well Baby Program is all about.  <br>  <br>  You will also receive food stamps for other needs.|`|QjBZxjcWaa	obesity is a big problem in USA<br>  junk food addicts & food stamps for fat people.
xxDjV6Axaa	Public defenders are for those who can't afford an attorney.  You can, so that isn't an option.  I would not choose an attorney by their price but by their experience or knowledge.  However, in this case, they know you did it so they are prosecuting.  If this is a first offense, most likely you are going to get fines along with paying back the amount you stole.  An attorney who is telling you that they can work some special magic, is lying.  Each judge will take everything into consideration then rule.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	You need an attorney who will negotiate the best plea deal.  If the facts fit, you might get a shoplifting plea.  "Retail theft" is not a familiar term to me.  I am not hearing anything about the two lawyers working to reduce your degree of theft to the lowest allowable under your state's law.  That is important for reputation reasons and possible opportunities for scholarships, college choices, and career.  The fact that you are sorry for your actions speak well about you.   Important point:  after this matter is over, it is important that you have your record expunged when you are 18 years old.  Assuming that is a legal option under the law of your state.   In a sense, you will be your own best lawyer by being truthful and avoiding an significant legal problems going forward.  Good luck.  I would want a lawyer who is going to negotiate on the degree of theft.   Money spent now may be minor to trying to save a few dollars.|`|RD5sTZaFaa	Your mother should hire one of these attorneys if she can afford it, if she goes with the public defender she will still likely be ordered to repay the cost of the attorney to the court.<br>  <br>  However, since you cannot afford an attorney yourself you might consider the public defender, who will not have to worry about whether or not the bill is paid, and only be concerned with representing your interests, not your mothers.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|AA10780838	If your mother makes enough money to pay for a lawyer you won't have the option of a PD.  In a case like this it really doesn't make any difference who you choose to represent you.

You should probably consult with a lawyer. When I had a legal question, I used quicklegalanswer.com. It was fast and cheap.

Besides child support goes to the mother to help take care of a child.|`|AA12146958	You cant. Child support is paid to the mother not the child regardless of age|`|PYkcUX1Baa	You won't be able to get it past the age of 18, but you can take him to court for refusing to pay child support throughout your childhood and get the back payments. <br>  <br>  Start by contacting the attorney general in your state to find out about the process.
LoSXjaGXaa	It's either because they can't fathom that there are some things that our government just can't catch in time to prevent or that they're trying to scare those that rely on government protection.  Both of these are prevalent in the people that mention it, usually in mixed doses.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Because Jihadists do not have access to a GPS system, only two of those exist, ours and the European Union's.  The Soviet or Chinese space programs couldn't exist without the use of one of those two satellite systems.  Either the U.S. did 9/11 to itself, or those 19 hi-jackers that that lived and trained in Hamburg Germany for the year and a half before they crashed those planes into the twin towers were working for the EU.  Muslim fundamentalists may hate the U.S., but heaven isn't a whore house, and they couldn't have flown such a coordinated set of attacks without the technology.  The truth sucks .don't it, but playing the United States Economic Industrial Complex off against OPEC (the globes only two real political equals to the EU) thereby draining the two biggest opponents of the European Union might just be luck, not a conspiracy or a contrived act of actual warfare.  <br>  <br>  Of course I might be full of $hit too, maybe we should just blame it on bad luck.|`|8b06acae86e7471a828ef5e2813ebb23aa	A few cards short of a full deck...<br>  <br>  A couple of carrots short of a bunch...|`|AA12104896	Yeah, the people who thought Saddam did 9/11, they are clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic.|`|AA10179458	A few chops short of a mixed grill.

That was a conspiracy too.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Some people are actually that stupid.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think liberalism strangles struggling young brain cells by preventing facts and reason from getting to them.|`|MnbMpzaoaa	Because the FBI cleared  visas for 12 people on the CIA terrorist watch list, most of whom were Saudi nationals and all od whom were invovlved in9-11.  Aftet the attack, the government gathered all the members of the Saudi royal family in the US and flew them out.  Because there were no pictures of an airplane or wings at the pentagon after the attack.<br>  <br>   Because bush sat there looking like the village idiot for 20 minutes after the attack.
t8JlnuqFaa	The American public was never supposed to know. The 2006 Justice Department document that exposes 35 terrorist training compounds in the U.S. was marked “Dissemination Restricted to Law Enforcement.” All the copies of Sheik Muburak Gilani’s terrorist training video, “Soldiers of Allah,” had been confiscated and sealed—all of them, that is, except one—that Christian Action Network now reveals in the documentary Homegrown Jihad: The Terrorist Camps Around the U.S.<br>  <br>  It seems unfathomable—nearly three dozen terrorist training compounds in the U.S. and the FBI, Homeland Security, and State Department are no help at all? But the evidence is irrefutable: as Jamaat ul-Fuqra (known in the U.S. as Muslims of America) leader Sheik Muburak Gilani professes on the Soldiers of Allah video, “We are fighting to destroy the enemy. We are dealing with evil at its roots and its roots are America.”|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Are there?  Where are they?  Who runs them?  How is it possible that a random, anonymous person on the Internet knows about them and yet law enforcement does not?|`|04021fc4881460602edfbe93dc6ae44eaa	If USA weren't creating itself combat zones, how do you think the military lobby would be poured from your taxes?|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Muslim Fundamentalists were just dupes who did the dying for a greater enemy of America.  The quicker we realize that our enemy is "Global Fascism" and attack it the quicker the "War on Terror" will be won.  The fact that a bunch of suicidal morons hate us and think they are going to blow themselves up and wake up in a whore house full of 72 virgins is not the problem.  The plan to monopolize the worlds oil supply to combat the economic attack on the American Economy failed, and that is the problem.  Sun Tzu told us 3000 years ago that "All warfare is based on economics", and today's American economic woes more than prove him right.  If Obama doesn't realize that, he will not be able to repair the damage that the previous administrations from Reagan, through the two Bush's and slick Willie have caused to what was once America.<br>  <br>  Hopefully God will bless America a few more times over the next four years.  As for religious freedom, people in the U.S. can believe what ever they want to, that doesn't mean their beliefs are true, it just means they have the freedom to choose ignorance over enlightenment.|`|q7v1XAHAaa	This won't stop anytime soon because they have a friend in the White House|`|y9vqyqeNaa	Where are they? Put your money where your mouth is and tell us where they are. <br>  <br>  If not, don't post that fiction.|`|JXMVNEQoaa	it said in a caption in one of the poster's videos that the 35 terrorist camps were disclosed and the FBI covered it up and the american public was never supposed to know so the terrorist camps are no longer there.|`|spuz7DvNaa	Not only do they seem to have a buddy in the white house, the bleeding heart politically correct liberals will get us all killed. Sad fact is liberalism and the decay it brings to society is one of the reasons radical muslims hate western society.
AA10179458	I agree. I like how they have more awards for themselves than any other profession. They love to pat themselves on the back. I find it funny how they love to preach morality yet they are always getting divorced or getting arrested or even hooked on drugs.|`|AA10287176	Given how out of touch the "common people" are with the rest of the world, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I'm not going to defend actors in general, but some in particular, think Bono and Angelina Jolie, are so much more in touch with the real state of the world, the conditions and problems associated with global poverty, and potential solutions than the common American is. <br>  <br>  Let's face it, the average American will never travel to a poor country, or if they do, it will be for a short period and they will remain in wealthy areas of the country. The average American has little to no understanding of the developing world, where most people actually live, and they are often completely and voluntarily disconnected from any information about the rest of humanity. The average American typically lives in a community of people much like him or herself and exposes him or herself only to TV shows, movies, and information about lives much like his or hers. The common American lives in spectacular wealth, takes his or her position for granted, and makes little to no effort to expand his or her horizons beyond the privileged conditions in which he or she lives.<br>  <br>  I guess what I'm trying to say is that the "common person" in wealthy countries lives a life much like those we imagine the most spoiled and sheltered movie stars live.|`|hqvPk8WIaa	Many of them (especially those who routinely star in blockbuster films instead of smaller, indy projects of substance) are spoiled and think they are better than others. However, a minority of actors seem to have a better mentality. We currently have an actor in the White House, and his ego is bigger than any jerk on the planet|`|L6Ko87r9aa	Because when reality TV became popular, society propped the actors up that high. They're just continuing what everyone else started.|`|8LBk7vUpaa	Success in Hollywood requires that one be first and foremost; a narcissist.|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	Fame and fortune are bad for many.|`|hQPi5t1Gaa	They are actors. Paid to play make believe. How could anyone take them seriously?|`|AA11042510	They dont..the public does...|`|UdERC367aa	Many succumb to where fame has propelled them, and have lost touch with who they really are.|`|GwFs2zLbaa	White house says hello to hollywood lol, what a joke of a administration we have.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	I would say they are more 'in touch' with the common people than most of our politicians are. The fact is, actors have to work to make their money. While they are overpaid, they actually have to produce results or they will lose their jobs. Congress, however, has the privilege of determining their own pay raises, their own medical care...at our expense, and how to spend all of our money. Congress members, like few others....can fail to perform their jobs, go on recess ALL summer long....take off every single weekend...even when we are in a serious recession, and WE THE PEOPLE actually vote them in again.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	I guess I need to know first, who it is you are referring to as common people and are common people the same as the little people.|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	they don't.  their fans and supporters do, and eventually these actors start actually believing they're special.  the problem?  they are special...for their ACTING.  who cares about their political leaning...it's just like anyone else on the street.  it is just an inflating ego that carries over from the actual source to a misguided one.|`|u23sBafTaa	The much sadder thing is why do people fall for it !  I can't say they''re are any of them that impress me so much that I would stand in line for tickets to see them , or go all crazy if I saw them.  All the crap on Brad Pitt at the White House was enough to make me want to hurl last night !  What is the big deal, most of them are far more impressed by themselves than anyone !<br>  <br>  Lt. guidestone   sounds like most politicians as well !|`|eihbYhI8aa	Just like the republicans and rich people who have the highest quality health insurance while we're all suffering right now.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	One word....."arrogance".

235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Anti-Israel protesters need to shut up and just take their punishment that is given their people by Israel. This is what Israel wants! Israel is just paying others back for what happened to them at the hand of the Nazi's and needs to steal someones land as they could not get Germany after the war!! Why else did you think they are being mean as hell to the Palestinians woman & children? They want millions of them to be exterminated to even the score and are doing it in Gaza, at the same time stealing the Palestinians land! This situation is not hard to figure out! America did it to the Native Americans, Israel is just repeating the same action and at the same time claiming the Palestinians are the problem by refusing to die, dry up and go away! America is allowing the Palestinians to be exterminated and acting as if they have nothing to do with it! This will continue to cause the U.S. problems in the Arab world and beyond! The trouble is the world knows the truth!|`|lJGnuMbbaa	they were probably muslim protesters|`|gc16g57Iaa	I think they have a right to protest Israel, if it's for reasons besides "they're Jewish, and since we're Muslim, we don't like them".|`|AA11511852	If the protest turns violent then I am against it.<br>  Peace full protesting is fine by me.
dFHsAXDMaa	All The OBAMA HATERS really need to think about this...OMG you people are so stupid really... We are still dealing with BUSH THE MORON fall out...... OBAMA has not lost 6 million jobs the Man has been in office what 2 months really this is all still fall out from BUSHHHHHHHH..... it took bush 8 years to destroy this country.. do you really seriously think Obama has a magic wand to fix it all in 2 months come on give me a break... research history a little OBAMA is more like Roosevelt the man who came in when economy was falling.. war was happening and is destined to be president for years like roosevelt was from 1933-1945 because just like back then hopefully the people will realize changing leadership in a time of economic crisis would be detrimental to this country.... Give the man a chance... stop charging on your credit card save some money and help a neighbor like people in the great depression did... we will survive this but it will get worse before it can get better.. unfortunately<br>  <br>  American lived that keep up with the jones life style too long buying house they could not afford on only one of the salaries of a couple... as the yelled charge it at the mall and out to dinner....And government lived above their means as well and now everyone needs to turn that around and that will take time and effort and compromise...<br>  <br>  Give the man a chance 2 months really ..... how is he suppose to fix in two months what took BUSH 8 years to ruin and why didn't all these people complaining do something to stop Bush and impeach him before we got to this point...think about that!|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	Really, it has only been a month and a few weeks, well he sure worked fast and totally fubared our economy - what's next?|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	No other president EVER has had the stock market drop so precipitously as has Obama.  No other president has a budget deficit so large as Obama.  If he can do that in only six weeks, how bad will he and the Democratic Congress destroy the fabric of our economy.  Jimmy Carter will start looking good.|`|cZypvAK8aa	How long are the Obama supporters going to make excuses for voting for the wrong man?  They cannot answer a single question about Obama's decisions without referencing Bush or Iraq. Obama lied on the campaign trail and he is destroying this country. Stop listening to his words and watch his actions. They are in direct contrast.|`|WoESqX8gaa	No,But how could Bush have accomplished the destruction of the economy as many libs think? If he was only President for 8 years. Your words...presidents can't even accomplish things in 10 years|`|gfB5VNXTaa	The way you Obamanites praised him, you sure had us thinking he could do it all in a matter of weeks|`|AA11369432	You can believe they are. What a pity!|`|gSdSRceRaa	You are ridiculous Hawk !  As if McCain knew in advance that a lot of casualties would occur on that particular day and decided to go gamble anyway !! Give me a break...you're talking out of your *** on that one.  You make yourself look like a fool.<br>  As for Obama.......it doesn't take a genius to see what he's all about. The cold hard fact is that the President suggests and Congress passes or rejects. Since it's your party that has controlled Congress for the past 2 1/2 years, any problems we have now are squarely on the shoulders of the democrats, and now that you also control the Senate and the Presidency, let's see how bad you can REALLY **** it up. Obama blasted Bush for wanting to spend 50 billion to reverse the economic trends and then Obama goes out and spends 3.6 trillion, with over 9000 earmarks that he said he would eliminate if he were elected. Just yet another Obama lie ! Face the facts///your guy is now what he has always been......a sleazy, Chicago political thug....only now he wears better suits ! <br>  As for Bush, he had 31 of 32 quarters that showed positive growth. The stock market eclipsed 13,000 ! The housing market boomed and unemployment was at it lowest levels for 20 years. <br>  Look at the stock market now. It's down because investors and corporate America have NO FAITH in Obama or in his insane smoke and mirrors policies.  The blame is on your party and on Congress failing to uphold its responsibility to the American people.|`|TQYQUNYHaa	He's not thinking on the what he is doing and is doing the wrong things and letting the Democrat Party continue to do what they did when they got control of the House and Senate under Bush.  He continues to act like a celebrity and not a President.  He is very disappointing and is not even cutting back with all the things he is doing personally.  You and all the Democrats should wake up and smell the roses before it is too late and just electing him as president is a sign that you just don't want to know what you are putting this country through.|`|3MM64geHaa	You need a Xanax.  Bush prevented another terrorist attack from happening. He took an evil dictator out of office when he refused for the 18th time to comply with the terms of his truce he made in the 90's. The stock market broke three record highs. Unemployment was low until the last two years. He gave us back our hard earned money.  He sure wasn't perfect but he did accomplish some good things.  Prices of oil rose in 2006.  You could just as easily blame the Dems since they took control.|`|6QOKsVaPaa	Why does Obama always come with an excuse?<br>  Obama has been a US Senator for the last few years and the Senate has been under Democrat Control during that time.  He's had plenty of time to help stem the madness.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	No, they're not.<br>  And there aren't that many of them.<br>  The dozens of posters you see here are only a few real people.<br>  <br>  They're doing it to cause trouble.<br>  It's the politics of distraction.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Actually, one of them posted something about him being in office 8 months earlier today so that might be part of the problem.  I am not joking.|`|SfPx4BTLaa	If Obama couldn't deliver on his promises then he shouldn't have run on them.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	You will be here next month saying "He's only been there for 2 months and a couple of weeks". That's right.|`|qaaLbzltaa	So what if he has only been in office for a month and a couple of weeks?  He is still doing things he said he wouldn't do, and he is still doing things I don't agree with!  You're basically saying that he can do anything he wants because he hasn't been in office that long.  That is BS and you damn well know it.<br>  <br>  Are you saying that he could start a war like Iraq, but it would be excused because he was only in office for a month?  Are you saying that he could rob us all, but it would be excusable because he has only been in office a month?<br>  <br>  What strange and pathetic logic on your part.<br>  <br>  And let go of the Bush adminstration.  You claim Obama is supposed to be change, so don't use the Bush admistration as excuses anymore.  He is supposed to be different.  If you can't defend Obama's admin without bringing up Bush's, then that tells me Obama is just a big failure and more of the same.|`|EdnQBmxZaa	Isn't that what he promised?  We are not upset by what he hasn't done, but by what he has:  1)  The $800 billion spending bill  2)  The new budget full of earmarks, after promising no earmarks  3)Announcing the closure of GITMO, despite having no idea what he will do with its inmates  4)  The move toward socialized health care      5)  The $900 million in aid to Hamas 6)  Nominating and then defending so many tax cheats for his cabinet  7)  Announcing he will cut the defense budget in the middle of a war 8) Proposing cap and trade measures which will double the cost of energy for everyone 9)  Announcing tax hikes in the middle of a recession.  These are all policies that will and have had a negative effect on the economy.   He has accomplished quite a bit in a month...none of it good!|`|i5TqhvrOaa	You are mentally challenged! The president has nothing to do with oil prices. Lets go back to jr high history class its all about supply and demand chief let's get with the program people. Yeah but his change is never going to come. Im sorry socialism is bad. RON PAUL 2012!

And than they resort to the "Oh its the libs and dems fault!" blame game.<br>  <br>  You can't reason with them, or be nice.

P1Sl55Coaa	I couldn't agree more.  My church has a ministry to Muslims, and they have the chance to try to convert us as we do the same to them.  My Pastor is a Jew, as well as his family, and he explains Jewish ways to us almost every week.  What ignorant christians are you referring to?  Also, every pastor I've ever studied under told his congregation that they could question anything he said at any time.  I wouldn't have it any other way.|`|vUiUoamVaa	It is called 'blind faith' or well, just not all that interested in exploring the different faiths.  Why did you limit it to Muslims and Jews?

I've always wondered that myself. lol|`|r2JPcUN8aa	I think it is the same reason they are ignorant to non-christian issues in their own communities.

Politics is politics..the 'wingers would scream bloody murder if we were on schedule to get out of Iraq AND Afghanistan at the same time.  The 'troops' keep the reactionaries quite while Mr. Obama figures out a way to get out that hell hole that the Bush Junta put us in.  The second part of this 'question:  What makes you think that we haven't been speaking with these guys for the last bunch of years?  Of course we've been speaking with them..we're trying to get them to stand down long enough for us to get the hell out of their country.  Bin Laden isn't there anymore, the puppet government we set up barely functions outside of Kabul and we can't afford to continue this nonsense.

But also keep in mind Hanity is an opinon show in which he gives his thought based on his perspective of the world. Thats not news reporting.

a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	"I remember not going past 45..." Still speeding.  You go to court and tell the judge "I was only doing 45 in a 30" and he'll probably believe you were speeding.  <br>  <br>  In order to beat a speeding ticket, you must prove to the court that either you were not speeding or the officer is not trained or is lying.  All three of which are very hard to do.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to go to court, tell the judge it is your first offense and ask for consideration.  Dress nice (no boxers showing, holes in pants, etc) be respectful and tell the judge it was a minor lapse of judgment and it won't happen again.  Odds are you will receive a reduced fine or possibly dismissal.  <br>  <br>  Just don't speed, you won't have to go to court.|`|IGXE3aDraa	bite the bullet you were speeding|`|GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate. Good luck!|`|lAsbD5B7aa	The laws vary with the city, county and state.

Life time prisoners suffering from cabin fever and death row inmates getting the choice between the orthodox means of punishment and getting to fight in the "Grand Tournament".<br>  <br>  With all the garbage that is allowed on tv today, I wouldn't be surprised if gladiator-matches would one day be considered good enough entertainment to be shown on live television...|`|J7M7FP02aa	thats cruel just because they are convicts doesnt mean they can't/wont change and it Definatly doesnt mean they aren't real people|`|LoSXjaGXaa	I'm pretty sure this goes against the "cruel and unusual punishment" bit of the Constitution.

You don't see many air force formations, forced marches, IG inspections, or competition on the rifle range.<br>  <br>  The air force offers a different service to the Pentagon than do the other services.  It offers the ability to strike distant targets with all the might of nuclear warfare, in a very small space of time.  It offers stellar capability, the technology to attack at night, undetected by the adversary, and on its way back home, before the target realizes what happened.  The air force enjoys a good reputation amongst the other services and it rarely engages in intra service rivalry.<br>  <br>  Marines often offer bragging rights, and for those who already have disdain for this service, it only exacerbates matters.  It is a great branch of service with much tradition.  It has a fine repuation and many huge fans !|`|UCNPFSw8aa	Because the Air Force is the most technologically inclined, they do have a higher budget than the other branches. Since they are somewhat considered the brains of the military, they get better facilities, bases, etc...Also remember that the AF is the youngest branch, whereas the other branches are centuries old. This also has a lot to do with the bases. Newer branch, newer bases. The Air Force does get a lot of flack from the other branches though (ever heard of the "Chair Force"?), but it's all branch rivalry. <br>  <br>  The Marines though are by no mean disrespected. I have nothing but respect for Marines.
vWIouzK3aa	You don't make "sence". Not surprisingly you can't even spell sense. <br>  <br>  In 2001 you'd have trouble getting cell reception in a tunnel let alone a plane at 8000 feet. <br>  <br>  Do you really believe Mark Bingham called his <br>  mom and said "Mom. This is Mark Brigham."<br>  <br>  The story of Barbara Olson's collect calls to <br>  her husband changed. At first it was said <br>  these calls were made from her cell, but why <br>  call collect from your cell? So the story was <br>  changed to she used an airfone while in the <br>  lavatory. Anybody seen airfones in the <br>  lavatory?<br>  <br>  Now, what don't you understand about fuel not burning hot enough?<br>  <br>  Jet fuel only burns at 1,800 degrees under optimum conditions, & would have burned up in 15 seconds, & it takes 2,800 degrees to melt steel, so the Commission Report could not have been true, that the jet fuel weakened the steel girders, causing them to bend & buckle. Even if you want to believe that, every girder would have had to weaken at the same time, all 110 floors to allow that building to collapse as quickly as it did and that is ridiculous to believe. The commission stated that the burning desks, plastics & paper also weakened the steel, but they only burn at 450 degrees which is nowhere near hot enough to damage steel. Steel is not melted in stoves or pots or pans. A Madrid towering inferno burned for well over 24 hours gutting the entire building but leaving the steel frame intact. There was no such inferno at the wtc and they didn't burn nearly as long. North tower burned for only 1hr 40min, South Tower less than 1 hour. Molten steel was seen flowing from the towers before it crashed and found at the base of all 3 buildings. Both the 2 main WTC buildings and Building 7 had Core columns cut at an angle and pools of molten steel found at base of all 3 buildings. Proof positive explosives were used to take them down.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	They are little weirdo Democrats.<br>  <br>  Edit********  "Confederate States Forever" has it Correct.)<br>  <br>  While Democrats lay around waiting for their Welfare Checks to arrive---- they think up all kinds of conspiracies.<br>  <br>  And........  they did vote for Obama.|`|482oQASHaa	i think 9/11 was an inside job because of all the reasons is listed. The Official 9/11 Story is nothing short of a "big lie" used to help cover up the crime and then shift the blame to Middle Easteners. <br>  <br>  President Bush, with the help of his Neocon buddies attempted to take complete control of the U.S. by decapitating the Legislative branch of the federal government: They are treasonous murders and would be dictators too, if they had not blundered in their attack of the Capital with Flight 93. They left plenty of evidence at each of the attack sites that implicates them to the crimes. The Following is a summary of what really happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  World Trade Center Buildings<br>  <br>  The World Trade Center buildings were brought down by controlled demolition after being attacked by aircraft. The only evidence our government provided that Osama confessed to the crime is fake. Most every video taken of the towers shows explosives just before the towers imploded. Traces of explosives were also found at ground zero. <br>  <br>  PENTAGON<br>  <br>  There is also strong evidence to support a Douglas A-3 Skywarrior armed with a missile hit the Pentagon. Witnesses say, the U.S. military secretly had Raytheon Co. refit an A-3 Skywarrior with new jet engines, a missile, and a Global Hawk guidance system, just prior to 9/11. Both the jet engine housing as well as a "front end rotor head", found at the crash site, have been identified as belonging to a Pratt & Whitney JT8D jet engine, supporting the witnesses claim. This engine does not fit the commercial Boeing 757 that is said to have hit the Pentagon.<br>  <br>  <br>  FLIGHT 93<br>  <br>  United Airlines Flight 93 did not crash as a result of a struggle between the passengers and the alleged hijackers, but in fact was shot down by the North Dakota Air Guards flying F-16's. On orders from Adj. General of the State of North Dakota and in opposition to V.P. Cheney's stand down orders, Major Rick Gibney spotted the airline flying on remote, headed toward Washington D.C. and shot it down. This is why debris, including human remains, rained on areas several miles away from the crash site.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I first thought 9-11 was an inside job on Sept. 12th, 2001. It seemed awful suspicious to me that they had not an knowing   of what was going to happen and yet by the next day knew everything..all the attackers names, flight training history and even what libraries they had used which I don't even know how they would know this as some libraries do not require ID to use Internet nor have cameras..and yet we supposedly knew this.<br>  <br>  Then it came out that other countries had warned us and that Bush had warnings.<br>  <br>  Few things other than steel survived in big pieces and yet there was a hijacker ID, how convenient and now many of the so called hijackers are coming forward alive and saying they had lost their passports prior to 9-11<br>  <br>  Then I heard 5 hours radio show by maker of inplanesite that was most compelling.<br>  <br>  Now I have seen loose change and only two days ago watched mysteries911 DVD that was given to me three times with family members. This DVD is most compelling. I was particularly struck by the slant cut steel beams looking like one that were wired as the explosives cut on a slant so the building falls inward and doesn't damage surrounding structures. Slant cut beams with evidence of the use of thermite.<br>  <br>  If that many websites are out there, hopefully, the American people will wake up in time, not trust their government leaders, and do something while there is still time. I predict worst lies ahead for us and the world.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	This is a collection of people who may have some answers for you, many of which make lots of sense.<br>  <a href="http://patriotsquestion911.com/" rel="nofollow">http://patriotsquestion911.com/</a><br>  <br>  By the way, all the stupid theories about 9/11 are disowned by the majority.<br>  <br>  Also, many, of the bereaved families, and survivors, think 9/11 was an inside job, one way or another.

HZvdr8VLaa	If he don't get a lawyer and try to cop out to a lesser charge, he will most likely do some county jail time.|`|2A7wuyNyaa	ya i think he will get jail time because of the things he committed.|`|l9iGfpB4aa	Here is a true scenario in California.  My son, age 27 was charged with spousal abuse. Now my daughter-in-law only wanted the cops to talk to him because she thought he was suicidal. Instead the sheriff dept. took it upon themselves to re-write my daughter-in-law's statement and charge him with 3 felony counts. As a result his bail was 10,000.00. I got him out (10,000 cash--loans from credit cards). We did not pursue the advice of an attorney because since we knew he has innocent of the charges we assumed they would be dropped at arraingment.  Much to our surprise, the judge up the bail to 220,000 and put him in jail.  I got him out on the 10% or 22,000.(more credit card debt!).  I immediately hired the best attorney I could find.  He charged 10,000 (again credit cards). and now six months later my son sits in a LA county jail.  I am in shock!  We were told by the attroney that since the head D.A. is an ex-cop we did not have a chance, but that if we paid an extra $10,000 and took it to trial he would probably win the case.  I did not have the $$ so we plead bargained to on charge--a felony. My son never had a record, was never in trouble, but because he was not able to get mental health insurance for his depression, he lost his job, had his car repo'd, his 9-year-old son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetis, and got depressed and for a few seconds, put an unloaded gun to his head and scared his wife enough for her to go to try to get help( what a joke!), he is now being punished. He was sentenced to 60 days. He is also in very poor health, has asthma, gouty arthritis, etc.  I hope your state, D.A. and police department in your town does uphold the law.  He should get an attorney, go to anger mngmt classes, couseling etc.  I wish you the best!

Most communities have a public medical clinic  where residents of the area may make an appointment to see a doctor.  In this system, you always see a general practitioner first, who may refer you to a specialist, if necessary.<br>  <br>  Special clinics for well-baby care  are  part of this system.  At these clinics, children under school age are weighed and measured on a regular basis and given the necessary immunizations.  Nurses specializing in well-baby care and child development are available to answer questions and discuss concerns about your child.<br>  <br>  Many Norwegian doctors have their own private practices.    You may call any of these doctors in your area and make an appointment at any time and get in quickly.<br>   <br>   First aid stations are located in most communities to serve those who have a non-life threatening illness or injury and who must be seen by medical personnel immediately.  <br>  <br>  Public emergency medical service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.<br>  <br>  Norway has extensive health services and a well-developed social safety net. All those who are residents in Norway have a right to economic assistance and other forms of community support during illness, old age or unemployment.<br>  <br>  It's not so bad. In fact, it's good. You're going to love this one.  Say you have psoriasis or such a condition.  If it is bad enough, Norway will  most likely send you to a dry, warm and sunny climate for several weeks to clear the problem up!<br>  <br>  In the US you need to see a GP first before you can see a specialist, unless you already have a medical relationship with a specialist.<br>  <br>  You can't just get in to see a specialist in the US. It takes weeks, unless you have a dire emergency.<br>  <br>  And if you do not have health care insurance, it's pretty much guaranteed that you will only receive the most minimal treatment to help you.|`|mULVP4k4aa	Probably not.

And I think it is obvious he is doing very well thus far and that his non supporters are going to complain regardless....<br>  <br>  But I think you asking if they are racist is just as ridiculous as the rants of non supporters. <br>  <br>  People hate for all sorts of stupid reasons, not just "hidden racism".<br>  <br>  I think that when people call people racist because they discredit his politics than you are being irresponsible.  Racism is a serious thing, and a strong label and it is insulting that the name is thrown out as an ace card.|`|cZypvAK8aa	I have a problem with Obama because he is not an American citizen and should not be president in the first place. I don't like his associations. I don't like his policies. I don't like his decisions since he has been in the White House. I don't want our country destroyed by this traitor.|`|AA11313983	No.  I have a problem with Obama because his answer to Bush's failed policies is to expand them.  His policies are not a race.<br>  <br>  Just let me know when a bailout actually works.  And no, AIG coming back to the trough isn't a success.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	No I don't.|`|AA11209831	Nope, I have a problem with him because of his Socialist agenda.<br>  <br>  So, using your logic, "Otherwise it makes zero sense he has only been in office two months.  Is it hidden racism?".  That would mean that liberals are racist since they had MAJOR problems with President Bush before he was even in office.<br>  <br>  Just because I don't like someone that happens to be black that doesn't make me a racist.  If he was white and I didn't like him what would be your excuse then?  I didn't like Clinton and he was white, does that mean that I am a "race traitor"?<br>  <br>  As much as you liberals want it to be, not everything is racial.|`|RermzbWgaa	I have no problem with the type of melanin in Obamas skin.  The problems I have with Obama are on the issues.<br>  <br>  In two months he has shown where he stands on many issues and to where he wants to take this nation. Denial of that would be to not be paying much attention at all.  It may be some do not like that there are people who oppose those issues....but nonetheless it is quite legitimate to oppose this man on issues (these issues being at the foundations of political thought in fact).|`|3MM64geHaa	Right? It is a black thing. People could not be upset about pork spending. They could not be upset about a more powerful govt. They could not be upset over the stock market plunging every time he opens his mouth. They cannot be upset that he has spent more than a million dollars traveling the country the last 4 weeks. They just don't like his black half.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Being black has NOTHING to do with why I don't like him.  He is inexperienced, has radical ideas and is moving this Country in the wrong direction, putting us in deeper debt than that of any in History.  THAT is why I do not like him.<br>  <br>  Call it what you want, your idea that one must be racist to not like Obama is racist in itself.  Your own form o f hidden racism!|`|AA11562326	The question presumes I have a problem with Obama.  I don't, not so far.|`|WoESqX8gaa	No, I have a problem with your questions.|`|CZszdtemaa	Seriously, wtf difference does it make?|`|a6k5WZxGaa	No|`|hqvPk8WIaa	1) Obama is not black; the female who gave birth to him was white. He's not even black culturally either because he was reared by and grew up in a neighborhood surrounded by only whites and asians.<br>  <br>   2) I, personally, have never and would absolutely never use a thinly-veiled racist attack (such as mentioning a stereotype about black people) to criticize Obama. I make comments about his bad policies and his obvious lies.|`|9HRkwzruaa	I don't care what color he is.  He could be orange with purple polka dots for all I care.<br>  <br>  My problem is with his lack of experience, lack of leadership, deceit, and reckless actions.  That's due to who he is (and isn't), not to the color of his skin.<br>  <br>  Yes, he's only been in office 6 weeks, and already he has tripled our debt and spent more than the last several presidents combined - all without regard for the will of the people he's supposed to represent.  That's the problem.|`|235bcacadf560b8452c6d79f769b9159aa	Yes, Black people are a whole lot more intelligent and better looking than "White Folks" and its just not fair! What chance does a "White Person' have to defeat him when his superior intelligence, along with charm and looks that make him unbeatable! Concerning the presidency, "White Folk" are doomed until he serves two-terms and can no longer run again! Its really a form of skin-color discrimination, which puts the "CRACKERS" up against it! Black is beautiful and Barack Obama is stunningly handsome, articulate and charming! He is to quick-witted for a "White-Slow-Thinker", John McCain was a good example of this on the last campaign trail! When it comes to brains , the Black Race has the upper hand and as they stated at the beginning of the 2008, presidential race, the cream shall rise to the top and it did! President Barack Obama!|`|AA12325046	Never have and never will.  Color of skin has nothing to do with the ton of money he wants to spend at the expense of taxpaying Americans.  This type of question gets old and most Americans (at least sensible ones) do not base their vote based on race or what he has done so far while in office for that matter.  Many did vote fo rhim because of his skin color without caring about his experience, background, or who he had connections with and that sir is a fact.|`|XPSIn3wxaa	Not at all. I just HATE Socialist. That is why I live in a free Republic called AMERICA.<br>  <br>  If you like Socialism, go move to Russia or to the EU. We don't want your kind here voting for elected officials.<br>  <br>  Clear it up for you any there sparky?|`|8a8a4f9bdc242ac1527541eba8696dfeaa	No, it's because he's a Socialist and him and the rest of the government is grinding us up like hamburger with all the meddling they've been doing for the last 100 years.|`|SfPx4BTLaa	The race card won't work. Obama is half white and half arab. He has no black heritage and certainly not a part of the black experience in the United States.|`|AWSmknxLaa	of course not.  No one cares that he is black, or white, or green.<br>  <br>  We care about his socialist programs that will enslave the working man so the lazy can get by free.<br>  <br>  You are the only racist I see these days|`|GwFs2zLbaa	So criticizing him makes me racist? You're a dumbass|`|NyQjxmydaa	My problem with Obama is that he was voted for because he is black|`|g34x7iKhaa	*rolls eyes*|`|AA11031985	No, I don't like him because he's an inexperienced idiot|`|7HdgMaOnaa	he is only half black|`|kH0IxFa9aa	Yes because you people keep asking stupid questions and the man is smarter than anyone on here!|`|70ce28ddca2fb9f359700f7e854fcb03aa	No, cause he's an IDIOT!!|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Nope|`|p9m0yAYHaa	He has been in office for 2 months and if he and his supporters can't handle crictism he shouldn't have run for office. He first said that he would post every bill online 2 days prior(he lied). He then said he would be united, but his opinion on unity is that everyone should agree with him. that's not unity. Also he said no pork, no earmarks. Also how come he can't find people that pay taxes in his office?|`|i5TqhvrOaa	No i have a problem with his socialist policies and making people rely on the govt more than they should.

dFHsAXDMaa	all The OBama haters need to just shut up seriously... OBAMA has not lost 6 million jobs the Man has been in office what 2 months really this is all still fall out from BUSHHHHHHHH..... it took bush 8 years to destroy this country.. do you really seriously think Obama has a magic wand to fix it all in 2 months come on give me a break... research history a little OBAMA is more like Roosevelt the man who came in when economy was falling.. war was happening and is destined to be president for many years like Roosevelt was from 1933-1945 because just like back then hopefully the people will realize changing leadership in a time of economic crisis would be detrimental to this country.... Give the man a chance... stop charging on your credit card save some money and help a neighbor like people in the great depression did... we will survive this but it will get worse before it can get better.. unfortunately<br>  <br>  American lived that keep up with the jones life style too long buying house they could not afford on only one of the salaries of a couple... as the yelled charge it at the mall and out to dinner....And government lived above their means as well and now everyone needs to turn that around and that will take time and effort and compromise...<br>  <br>  Give the man a chance 2 months really ..... how is he suppose to fix in two months what took BUSH 8 years to ruin and why didn't all these people complaining do something to stop Bush and impeach him before we got to this point...think about that!|`|aCDWwsisaa	It isn't, and it was an (uncharacteristically) dumb thing for him to say.  I don't agree with Rush much, but he can usually defend his positions well.<br>  <br>  Rush is a good entertainer, but he is hardly "conservative"...he believes in divorce, uses drugs, and mocks religion... his comments were designed more to boost his ratings (good for him) than they were to help "America"...<br>  <br>  He is a smart man, but he will probably never realize how much he did to destroy the GOP when they are gone...|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	Obama's policies will push the US economy toward a TIPPING POINT where there are more people receiving benefits from the government that there are people producing the funds to provide those benefits.<br>  This lowers the standard of living for everyone and leads to hyperinflation and the devaluation of the currency.<br>  It also leads to greater government control of resources to maintain the supply of benefits which continue to decline and will need to be rationed.<br>  This has been the trajectory in every instance in which this system has ever been attempted.  EVERY time.<br>  <br>  This directly affects YOU at some point.<br>  You may get short term benefits - some freebies or reduced cost benefits - but eventually the value and quality of those benefits will be reduced.<br>  Are you personally willing to accept that decrease in the quality of your life or that of your children and grandchildren for some SHORT-TERM pleasure?<br>  <br>  We have a CHOICE to go down this road or not.<br>  If we go down this road, America fails.<br>  Who cares about whether Obama personally succeeds or fails?<br>  He is only one person out of 300 million.<br>  We want EVERYONE to succeed<br>  This is the American Dream that we can NOT allow to die.|`|3MM64geHaa	Okay, it is obvious you have not taken the time to listen to what Rush said at the convention. He wants O's socialistic policies to fail to be instituted. He wants him to fail to further his policy of making people dependent on the govt. He wants him to fail to destroy the economy further by punishing those who invest the most.  I mean really. Get a life.  The Dems thought that losing the Iraq war was going to be a good thing for the US.|`|WlDVd92paa	Because if obama fail america will run back to republicans-lol<br>   Suuuuure they will lmao!|`|V44ARW4maa	it's not, but rush limpballs falling on his face would be good for america.|`|222c3710b1c82cfb0a40a144369157a8aa	It isn't.

esOaJoqBaa	Train, train and then train some more. The grunts have only one job: to fight. Unlike other MOS that have an actually peace time function, the infantry has nothing to do but prepare to go to war.<br>  Most of their time is spent on training for various types of operations, and working with the weapons that they use. Extra time is spent on things like first aid training, language training, and any higher level professional military schools.<br>  Physical training, combat tactics and marksmanship training make up about 90% of the infantryman's time.|`|014NXPfFaa	PT at 6 in the morning, then breakfast. Then formation, then training.<br>  Depending on your unit your training cycles could be more strenuous then deployments (but more safe, obviously).  Train until 4 ish, then go home.  During your training cycles you could go to other bases to train there.  You could be training to use a specific vehicle.  You go to the 'field' which is like camping (minus the fun part) and training for anywhere from one night to a month.  You go to the shooting range and practice shooting, and you have live fires too which is when you are using live rounds.  You go to the range during the normal day and during the night (b/c you need to know how to shoot at night, too).  <br>  They make a calender that tells you when you go home at a normal time, when you go to the field, and when you have things to do at night.  Sometimes you don't go in until 6pm but you are there for 24 hrs.  Even though you don't do the same thing every single day, the things you do are not unusual - and you have a pretty good idea on your schedule for the upcoming three months.|`|2sPWYf5Paa	Training, training, training. If you are not deployed expect to spend long days out in the field playing GI Joe. You will pull security on the deer and raccoons, spend some time crawling through the woods yelling "Bang, Bang" and every now and you will get a shitty detail like post trash pick up. The time you do have in the rear will be spent cleaning the barracks and going over battle drills or some other class that is a time filler. Oh and PT every morning, sometimes twice a day. I hope you like hiking.
LcAiHBsaaa	I think your best bet is to do your Navy thing, then do high school sports stuff on the side to stay involved and network.  Volunteer to help out the wrestling team on the side (I wouldn't think you would be able to hold a job since you'd be going on deployment and have duty...)... that's just my educated guess on this, so take it for what it's worth! ;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|xPsv7ysvaa	im in the navy and was in the same place you were. i wanted to be a basketball coach but then i had the opportunity to join. i do play basketball while in the navy. go for the military and after your 20 yrs if your still up to it then go for the coach job.
a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	Think of it this way.  If you destroy the fingerprints and they are needed in an investigation, you could be charged with destruction of evidence, obstruction or both.  Especially if you are aware of the possible evidentiary value of the statue and fingerprints.  Your best bet is to turn it over to the police if you think a crime was committed.|`|e61e97ce7197ef3797fdc64f3b935342aa	You should hand it into the cops.

It was a terrible mistake to fail to act when we had a chance to take out an al-Qaida leadership meeting in 2005. If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf will not act, we will." Obama's stupid speech Ooooo, tough talk, but very unpresidential. In fact, it sounds like something that you’ll read from a campus news paper than a presidential candidate. Does Obama-Clown know that Afghanistan is a landlocked country and we have to flay of over Pakistan to get to Afghanistan? I bet he doesn’t even know where the county is.<br>  Look at the map and learn about the region. You Afghanistan and Pakistan to the south. We can get to Pakistan by sea, but we have to fly over Pakistan to Afghanistan. Pakistani President Musharraf is allowing us fly over his country over the objections of his own people.<br>  Now lets see what would happen if we attack Pakistan. First, Pakistan would fight back. So now we have to fly our troop over Pakistani’s rockets to get to Afghanistan. Since Pakistan is shooting at us, we shoot at Pakistan. Second, seeing this, India will side with us. India has been at odds at Pakistan over the region of Kashmir, so if India wins a war against Pakistan, India takes Pakistan. Third, Iran will side with Pakistan. Fourth, Israel bomb Iran. Israel, Pakistan, India, and the United States have nukes. Whether Iran have them or not, this would be the start of Nuclear War/World War III.|`|EtN6P9PPaa	China and the US.

You could also wish him to fail in getting support for an action you aren't for.

dFHsAXDMaa	OMG you people are so stupid really.... try reading the speech it is available online for you to read....people are complaining that Obama has lost 6 million jobs.....that he is making changer for the worse ( like BOB the fraud commented)  OBAMA has not lost 6 million jobs the Man has been in office what 2 months really this is all still fall out from BUSHHHHHHHH..... it took bush 8 years to destroy this country.. do you really seriously think Obama has a magic wand to fix it all in 2 months come on give me a break... research history a little OBAMA is more like Roosevelt the man who came in when economy was falling.. war was happening and is destined to be president for years like roosevelt was from 1933-1945 because just like back then hopefully the people will realize changing leadership in a time of economic crisis would be detrimental to this country.... Give the man a chance... stop charging on your credit card save some money and help a neighbor like people in the great depression did... we will survive this but it will get worse before it can get better.. unfortunately..this is how things usually work they have to get worse before we see them getting better...<br>  <br>  Americans lived that keep up with the jones lifestyle too long buying house they could not afford on only one of the salaries of a couple... as the yelled charge it at the mall and out to dinner....And government lived above their means as well and now everyone needs to turn that around and that will take time and effort and compromise...stop thinking about how they screw you over think about how you yoursellves were irresponsible with your budgeting and spending and fix it and help a neighbor or someone in your community.. that is how people survived the great depression they waited in line for their monthly allotment of say flour.. butter..sugar...even pantyhose... and they pulled together with neighbors and they did things like baked bread.. canned foods and share their resources with people so everyone was taken care of... This is what our neighborhoods need to do now during this hard time...for example if you are a mechanic and your neighbor needs help with a car repair help them and maybe they can help you with something you need..need a babysitter so you can go to work...maybe you can get a teenager to do it in exchange for helping them with something they need like ride or homework think about it... Go shovel out an elderly neighbor or mow their lawn for them...and not expect anything in return...bet she bakes you something anyway to say thank you....maybe if you were all a little less worried about what you don't have and more concerned and thankful for what you do have the world will be a better place....maybe it is time for teenagers to learn what hard work means and going without...and not getting everything handed to them.... maybe it is time for Americans to get back to simple pleasures in life Family, love. Neighbors and community spirit.<br>  <br>  Give the man a chance 2 months really ..... how is he suppose to fix in two months what took BUSH 8 years to ruin and why didn't all these people complaining do something to stop Bush and impeach him before we got to this point...think about that!|`|cZypvAK8aa	He constantly referred to Bush and the last eight years. He's like a broken record.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Well, I think he said pretty much "this is how things have been done the last eight years, and look how much that's screwed everything up...maybe we should try doing something (ANYTHING) else?"...<br>  <br>  And if you find something to disagree with in that, you are not living on the same planet as everybody else!|`|9HRkwzruaa	Uhhh...that was really about it.

You people are a little ignorant and arrogant. It wasn't the citizens of american not connected to the government that voted Obama into government, it was the Electoral College made up of Congressional nominees and Senators. Anyone can win off of electoral votes whether or not the other candidate took the majority of regular votes. Obama won from the electoral pool and even my vote for him really count. Look it up and raise your intelligence far greater than it is now. As for the person who questioned, you can just read his inauguration address here, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/politics/20text-obama.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/20/us/pol...</a> It's practically all there.|`|hqvPk8WIaa	There was a little empty rhethoric about unifying people.

Ca8i226Xaa	There is a propaganda campaign by the left wing MSM and the Obama administration to slander and libel Rush for two purposes. They want to silence a powerful voice against Obama's Socialist policies and they want to distract the nation from the fact that our economy is crumbling under Obama's Socialist leadership.<br>  <br>  Media Malpractice Propaganda Replaces News<br>  By Floyd and Mary Beth Brown<br>  March 7, 2009<br>  <a href="http://www.gopusa.com/commentary/guest/2009/fmb_03071.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.gopusa.com/commentary/guest/2...</a><br>  A new documentary movie by courageous filmmaker John Ziegler entitled "Media Malpractice" made its theatrical début last night in Seattle, Wash. The movie systematically proves how corrupt and dishonest the American media were during the campaign of 2008.<br>  <br>  The film was revealing, coming just days after a similar well-orchestrated effort by the Obama administration, Democratic Party officials, and liberal advocacy groups in league with the mainstream news media against Rush Limbaugh and Gov. Bobby Jindal as their primary targets.<br>  <br>  Even the president played his part in the bizarre, staged play by telling congressional Republicans, "You can't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done."<br>  <br>  Ironically, the plan to attack Limbaugh was already being hatched while the unfair attacks on Gov. Sarah Palin, documented by Ziegler, were reaching a crescendo last fall.<br>  <br>  The manipulation can only be called propaganda. Old-fashioned, unbiased journalism has died. The Limbaugh attacks in the news, we now know, were cooked up by Democratic strategists James Carville and Stanley Greenberg last fall. Internet-based Politico reveals the White House involvement in the conspiracy when it reported, "A senior White House aide has been tasked with helping to guide the Limbaugh strategy."<br>  <br>  Members of the media are performing their part of the script. Three speeches and the media's response to them serve as concise illustrations of the media role in the propaganda machine. They acted in unison, attacking and vilifying Limbaugh and mocking Jindal. Conversely, they are a choir of praises for the "tone of his speech" when reporting about Obama's address to Congress.<br>  <br>  Limbaugh delivered his terrific speech at the CPAC conference and it was broadcast nationwide. He detailed the differences between ultra- liberal Barack Obama's big government agenda and the ideal of smaller government. He explained why conservatives care about the individual. Limbaugh's speech inspired the crowd, reminding them of the founding principles of America. He showed how starkly Obama's philosophy differed from traditional American ideas, while explaining what exactly is at stake in this present debate.<br>  <br>  However, you wouldn't know this by listening to the mainstream media. Bill Schneider on CNN said "Well, it was an angry tone... this was a very angry speech. They didn't do so well last year but they're still angry. The tone of this speech was mocking, bullying, it was full of contempt, and I thought it was a very harsh speech." David Letterman and Katie Couric joined the fun mocking Limbaugh's clothing and his delivery, this, given the fact that none of the late night comedians have poked any fun at Obama while they viciously mocked Bush. Chris Matthews lambasted Limbaugh while needling his guests to disown him.|`|AA11086243	yeah... isn't that the magazine that broke the story that John Edwards was having an affair... <br>  <br>  they never get anything right...|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	What the heck are you smoking. We just have to turn on the radio to get "intel" on Rush. It doesn't come from the Enquirer.
esOaJoqBaa	There are general that are not in charge of combat units, that is why. A woman will not be a general over an infantry division, but she could over a logistics unit. There are large units that are dedicated to logistical support and administrative activities, and the women who have experience in those fields can become a general.<br>  The highest jobs in the military are filled by combat commanders, and will thus always be men.|`|9I3wHIdraa	Yes their are many especially in the Air Force.|`|2sPWYf5Paa	When it comes to ranks that high, the generals won't be making direct combat decisions. They are more of a face for military orders given by the government. And if I have to look at a face I'd rather it be a woman's than a crusty old guy who, (just being honest) probably has seen as much combat as my grandma. Officers at that level don't get dirty.|`|LcAiHBsaaa	You're a sh!t head.<br>  <br>  Women serve to the same degree as men... we're all a team here dude.  <br>  <br>  Get out of the 20's and into the 21st century!<br>  <br>  Dee dee dee...|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	LOL have you ever served in the military at all?  <br>  <br>  Why should someone who never been in the military be president then?|`|RyFCRcIUaa	Pity,another ranting and raving military reject who is missing or has lost his cohones!<br>  <br>  <br>  move on with your life!
JthubNIsaa	I voted for McCain not so much that I was for him as much as I was against Obama. Sad but true. So now we are all stuck with Obama's vision of Utopia. He says we need to tighten up our belts and yet he spends 100.00/serving on White House steak dinners and high cost concert performances. All at taxpayer expense.  I can't say I am surprised but I am shocked at how in your face his blatant hypocrisy is.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No, not at all he is trillions of times better than Bush. Comedians were worried they would have nothing to joke about & Jindal, Rush, & the other loonies from the right have made comedy funnier than ever. I think on the 13th Will Farrell has a special coming on where he impersonates Bush so he is still good for comedy. Steele is the other one who most people don't know about yet but I do & he is so mean. So as the reps. make fun of Obama & Obama leaves it all alone so karma can get them it has been a very nice time that dems are having.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	I regret that people voted for him, yes!!<br>  <br>  I see the problem from a different angle he is doing too much of what he said he would.<br>  <br>  What are you disappointed in - did you not get your mortgage paid for yet or what.|`|MEReSvZeaa	I have no regrets.<br>  <br>  I didn't vote for him, though.|`|qaaLbzltaa	I sadly voted for Obama back in Nov. because I didn't think there was a better choice.  I was becoming reluctant though right before election day, but since I had supported him all along, I figured I might as well vote for him, since I didn't think McCain was better.<br>  <br>  When I saw McCain's speech that night, I instantly regretted my vote.  I had always considered myself a liberal before, but something had changed.  For some reason, I had this feeling that I had been duped, and I think I was right.<br>  <br>  As soon as he announced his plan for the stimulus, I knew I had voted for more of the same.  I'm sure McCain would have been no different, but I still had been duped, and now I wish I would have voted 3rd party.|`|PHpKo5hZaa	What I regret is that you voted for Bush twice. If you don't like the result now, plan more carefully next time.<br>  <br>  Edit: I see at least a couple Republican sycophant strawmen on here lying that they voted for Obama. Nice try - not.<br>  <br>  I always believed that being a stand-up person was the first step in being human.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Heck no!  I don't even have a job and I am keeping my head above water.  This is a time to tread water and wait for times to get better instead of wishing for the good old days.<br>   George W spent "the good ole days" on his war to avenge Daddy; so now that he is gone we can look to the future and letting the economy snap back under Obama.  But it took 8 years to tear us down and it will take time to build it back up.  don't be so impatient! All things happen in God's time not yours or mine.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Oh, he's following through very very well - check your republican lies at the door.<br>  <br>  And I'm so completely pleased I voted for the guy.  it's nice that America has a winner now instead of a nasty, horrid, treasonous little loser like Li'l Bush!|`|dX4Dll0yaa	I didn't vote for him. However, you can't expect him to accomplish all of his campaign promises before being in office 100 days. However I feel the bailouts are not the direction we need to be moving in.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	No I do not regret it.<br>  And he is following through.<br>  <br>  HE'S NOT DONE YET, moron.|`|WlDVd92paa	I regret voting for bush if it wasn't for him obama would not be he clean up man|`|prW1i0vzaa	I didn't vote for him in the first place.|`|RjhzHcSuaa	lol im just going to copy & paste from another question who just asked this<br>  <br>  I think he was the best candidate still but I wish I hadnt had voted at all, I found out a few things after I voted. I'm really not impressed with his handling of the economic crisis.|`|eXAzAoNraa	No. <br>  <br>  I think he is doing everything he can. Bush left him a really big mess to deal with, it's going to take time. Do you have a better plan?|`|sne1zGcyaa	Didn't vote for him..<br>  But a lot of people are regretting they did.<br>  & many politicians aren't backing him up now..<br>  notice how now some of them aren't agreeing to what he's doing..|`|K8PjbPOHaa	everyone should be regretting by now|`|6sJhoXAAaa	No because I didn't vote for him. It is too soon to see what he will accomplish though.|`|FU884E5jaa	yes obama sucks... and his stupid bailout too|`|yZXe2XLlaa	I regret sending his campaign money in the primary race, I thought he was a fresh new face, with fresh new odeas.

lAsbD5B7aa	It is legal in some areas.|`|bS7DN85Qaa	I think that the government making that illegal is a bit hypocritical. Aren't you allowed "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"? If being a hooker is someone's version of a "pursuit of happiness", they're restricting that. Which is bad.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Yes.  I completely agree.<br>  It would be MUCH safer for prostitutes AND their clients that way!!<br>  <br>  I think it should be a legal and regulated industry.<br>  No pimps who abuse and steal from their prostitutes, and required STD screening for both clients and prostitutes.<br>  <br>  EDIT: as for people who think that prostitution should be illegal because it is immoral . . . how do you legislate morality? What is moral?  Many religions say that extra-marital sex is immoral, but that isn't illegal.  I could go on.<br>  As for the person who said that no one would get married . . . seriously!? Prostitutes might get more business if their trade is legal, but that doesn't mean no one will fall in love and get married.  Marriage and money-for-sex are COMPLETELY different, and one does not preclude the other.<br>  Also, prostitutes are currently more involved with drugs and violence because prostitution is part of the same illegal, underground society and commerce.  If it were legal, there would be quite a bit of difference between the two . . . it would become more like saying that alcohol and cigarette companies are involved in drugs and violence.  (I draw this correlation because they are all "vices" but the controlled, commercial nature of alcohol and tobacco keeps them minimally associated with illegal vices).|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Yes.<br>  The sensible Netherlanders do it and seem to be OK with it.<br>  It does "happen all the time', and by criminalizing it, we <br>  raise the possibilities for abuses.<br>  If we legalized it we might make it safer 'public health-wise', <br>  as well as 'crime wise' and get some (gasp), tax revenue out of it too.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	the fed think that you can give it way, just dont sell it cause there is no way to tax it.but i think that if there a re ADLUTS that want to its up to them...|`|744c8eae5484becd40580fc96dfd8ac2aa	No. It devalues a society.|`|IszwcN0caa	Yes i think it should be illegal. Because personally i feel its degrading society, also degrading both men and women, women who are prostitutes and men who pay for these services. Finding a job is hard specially during this time of the recession but seriously no women should resort to prostitution it is just wrong and immoral. And im sure alot of these women have children, which is sad, imagine being a child and knowing your mother is a prostitute. Its not only unhealthy but unsafe and mentally disturbing for their children or anyone who cares for this person. How prostitution is even legal in some places i dont even know why anyone would want to allow it. its just wrong in so many ways. Prostitutes also have are more likely to be involved with drug abuse and violence. It should be illegal everywhere.|`|fKEJ9fUmaa	This being a victimless 'crime,' I absolutely do think it should be legal.<br>  <br>  I can't understand why anyone else's sex life is anyone else's business. I think it's just another case of one person's morals trumping another's honestly.<br>  <br>  I can't imagine someone picking up random women/men in a bar and taking them home and having meaningless, casual sex and then never seeing them again any better than prostitution except that in the case of prostitution, both parties agree the relationship ends when the act ends. You can't say that about users in bars.|`|QEM1R8X0aa	Just because it's done all the time doesn't make it right. People get raped every day. Doesn't mean non-consensual sex should be legal.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, I don't really have an opinion on this issue.|`|wxASMER0aa	no, i don't think so, lets look at it this way: if every1 of us supplies his sexual need with a prostitute no 1 will ever get married and we'll have lots of children (prostitutes') that are homeless <br>  just an opinion

An owner of a store I go to has stopped health care on his employs, because he wants to cut back on stuff. He told them they have to find their own health care. If someone doesn't have health care, it doesn't mean they "don't have a job". Anyone who thinks so is ignorant. Just like there are republicans who think all democrats are lazy people who refuse to get a job and rely on mommy, daddy, and the government to wipe their butts for them. It's pure ignorance.<br>  <br>  And lots of companies aren't hiring. My uncle lost his job and he has been looking. Not even Mcdonalds will hire him. If there were "lots" of jobs, then people who were laid off would easily find another job. There's too many people who are unemployed during these times and there's not enough jobs for them.
1CgK5Le6aa	Where to begin? First, not all “Liberals” believe that, most in fact do not. Most of those who do are pretty far to the left. The office equipment was blown out by the force of the explosion, not by the fire itself. The question to ask about the pentagon, from my understanding, would be how the plane went by running cameras without being filmed then seemed to disappear after the explosion. I don’t buy in to this stuff, but that’s the argument I’ve heard.<br>  Obama picked up a lot of the Democratic base (minorities, unions, environmentalists, etc.) and a lot of the center-right. Why? Because Palin represented the most extreme neoconservatives, and not much else. McCain represented the center for most of his career, but seemed to bow to the party and their political machine (see Max Cleland or McCain’s own primary campaign in ‘04), which put a lot of people off. His “nomination” of Palin (he wanted Lieberman) was offensive to a lot of Americans, and her behavior on the campaign trail was even more so. This was contrasted against Obama’s calls for bipartisanship, and his general calm, reasonable demeanor. He didn’t make any really gross attacks on either of his opponents, even while they were trying to raise questions about his integrity and patriotism. His campaign seemed to focus on the issues, which seemed more presidential and relevant to the tidal wave of issues facing the country.|`|Syvig9Q9aa	Your question contradicts itself you nitwit.<br>  <br>  We believe that 9-11 was orchestrated by the BUSH ADMINISTRATION and their associates.

Douglas, William Brennan, and Thurgood Marshall, then I would say that any discrimination against gay people is invidious, and thus a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. I could also claim that getting married is a fundamental right implicitly guaranteed by any and all three clauses of the 14th Amendment and gays are being denied that fundamental right.<br>  <br>  But I interpret the Constitution responsibly, with discipline, with respect to respectable precedents and with deference to the intent of the ratifiers of the Constitution. So I think all of those interpretations, yours and the ones I just mentioned, are wrong.|`|AA10465540	Discrimination is wrong with any group.  The main reason why many people are opposed to gay marriage is fear.  They are afraid that somehow, by allowing homosexuals to marry, heterosexuals will be in some unknown way convinced to take up the homosexual lifestyle.  They fear that homosexuals will somehow teach their children to be gay. It is not possible to turn someone gay or to teach them to be gay, anymore then a person can be taught to be another color.  Gayness is not something that rubs off and you cannot catch it from a toilet seat or by someone breathing on you.  Oddly the same people that fear gay marriage will seek the gay hairdresser because he does their hair so much better.  None of it sensible.|`|yJE7INkUaa	The ONLY reason that gay people don't have equal rights and cant get married is because of religion. I cant think of a reason otherwise and i think it is ridiculous that this country STILL doesn't allow gay marriage.

Politicians don't want to change it because its against their religion or they don't want to upset their Christian supporters because otherwise they wont be re-elected.|`|kXGDSZGOaa	how are gays being discriminated against regarding marriage? they are allowed to marry a person of the opposite sex just as i am. that's not discrimination.

The war was viewed as a success because their borders had been defended against American attack. When coupled with the popular myth that the militia had been responsible instead of the British regulars, this resulted in a new sense of nationalistic pride. However the conflict had a negative effect on the Canadian military. The 'militia myth' led to the popular opinion that a regular Canadian Army was not required. The Americans had attempted a number of times to invade canada, each one unsuccessful and further fulling this belief. It was not until the First World War that this popular belief was dispelled.|`|0hjvOg7Oaa	It doesn't matter if we were a British "colony' or that we didn't become a nation until 1867, looking back over the last two hundred years, what we achieved was to keep the Yankee hordes out of our land.|`|sMbIzXbUaa	The war did not have significant effect|`|zsUznopJaa	NOT MUCH BECAUSE THEY WERE STILL PART OF GREAT BRITAIN|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	None, <br>  <br>  There was no Canada in 1812<br>  <br>  Canada didn't become a nation until 1868.

If the section cited as the offence and the wording is incorrect, then yes you could.  If the officer alleges you made an illegal right turn and charges your for "no left turn", you obviously didn't commit the offence.<br>  If it is in a note section, I guess the officer could articulate a mistake.  <br>  It wouldn;t hurt to try.|`|T2WPvUc1aa	You probably won't get away with it. If the offense was failure to obey a traffic control device, you still committed that offense, whether it was a right or left turn that you made illegally. It really depends on the judge, but generally, minor mistakes like that will not get you found innocent. The direction of the turn was not written correctly on the ticket, but the offense title would fit no matter which direction you turned in.

Oh and for an insider hint when you first get to basic and they test you for the first time- dont run as fast as you can- take a steady slower pace.

Seward was President Andrew Johnson's Secretary of State at the time Russia (who needed the $) offered to sell us the territory we now call Alaska.  <br>  <br>  At the time, it was thought that there was no need to acquire this rather remote piece of land (and it was separated from the continental US by Canada) - we were spending money on something that was basically useless (an ice box) and all but inaccessible.  What use did the USA have buying this right after our War Between the States?  We had enough problems without acquiring new land.  <br>  <br>  Fortunately, he had the vision of fur and timber and of other resources the land offered.

That is why they had the "The citizenship referendum" in 2004. Which states that babies born in Ireland to non-nationals will no longer have an automatic right to Irish citizenship. If you and your husband are caught both you and him and your child will be deported. How they find out? simple you have to get the child a birth certificate. Both you and husband will have to some some identification papers with you, and if they see you don't have them they will deport all three in this. Ireland has deported quite a few people. To prove it click site below. The only thing you can do is register the child with your embassy.

Just stand there and say nothing unless he/she asks you to.  I strongly suggest you write the letter of apology and make sure the store manager receives it before you go to court.  Make a copy of the letter to show the judge should he/she is interested.

tUtxtYnWaa	It's sweet and responsible of you that you're taking care of your mother's things and her pets, but it's at a severe price to your own financial situation.  The question I really want to ask you is, Do you think she's innocent or guilty?<br>  <br>  You're asking if you jumped the gun in making preparations for her staying incarcerated--that immediately causes me to believe that you think she's guilty of the crime.  If this is the case, you may want to start looking for a good home for her dogs.  Also, why is she being charged with child abuse?  Did she abuse you?  Did she have your siblings living with her?  You mention her dogs, but nothing about any kids.<br>  <br>  At some point you have to stop enabling.  It sounds like your mother hasn't been a responsible person (selling cocaine!), but you are--which is great.  However, you don't deserve to suffer for her crimes.  <br>  <br>  Since she is renting, having her items put in storage seems sensible and less expensive than taking care of a living space that she is not occupying.  The dogs could be left with friends who don't mind having them, or at the Humane Society.|`|AA12146958	Yes you jumped the gun. It would have been better to have waited until she was sentenced. Now if she does not go to prison you will have a hard decision to make. Whether to live with your mother or find a new apartment.

GdnQ81bbaa	Your best bet is to contact the courts and ask them these questions. They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class. This will prevent your insurance from going up and points from being placed on your license. Just make sure you get the courts permission before doing so. If you don’t the courts will reject your driving school certificate.

33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	Retail establishments accept cards with special requirement that they have to be physically present. In other words, the card must be swiped at the mag reader. If the mag reader isn't working right, them the imprint must be done to prove that the card was physically in the store. The merchant pays lower fees per transaction for physically present cards. <br>  <br>  If the card wasn't in the store, then the transaction was considered a "tele-sale", and the merchant will have to pay higher fees to the processor, as the card number could be "stolen". Some stores will not even accept tele-sales. If the card don't work, try another one, or pay cash, or CXL the whole sale.|`|93r3nCM1aa	I had to do that sometimes as well when I worked retail.

That's just standard protocol in some stores. It's verification that the card was actually swiped, and that someone else didn't just come in and verbally give an account number. <br>  <br>  If you didn't receive a copy of the receipt, you could have just asked. But it's not required for them to give you a copy of the imprint of your credit card, and honestly theres no reason for you to receive an imprint of your own card.|`|nwMBfgcdaa	He was taking an imprint of the card.  Before they had debit machine, stores would use a manual machine to take the imprint of the card and number to prove the payment was made.  <br>   I have seen stores do that when the magnet strip couldn't be read for some reason and they manually had to put in the number. That way they can show the card was actually presented and the number wasn't just typed in (usually that would indicate fraudlulent use) It may be store policy to prevent fraudulent use. <br>  Or he could have been doing it to obtain your number.<br>  I would talk to the manager of the store.  Since the account is no longer in use, you don't have to worry anyway.|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	it could be that he was getting an imprint of your numbers to use later, so be aware of it, but if the account is closed, then he wouldn't be able to use it.|`|QlXhPFSwaa	if it bothered you much, why didnt you ask him what was that for? and why are/did u sign it for?|`|ANUNMUrlaa	You should report him to the police bro.

Their free ride will be over.|`|AA11086243	it's so funny that "all the wealthy aren't greedy"... but all the dems "sure are lazy"<br>  <br>  HAHAH... one is about as true as the other... you decide how true they are yourself...|`|9cbd33d2161007ec93c0593d77c8434faa	No the left is just jealous that they are ambitious|`|auJiPMAmaa	Nope, while not rich, doing good.  We work hard, are smart with our money, don't over indulge (i.e. haven't had a new car for two years), etc.  Not greedy.|`|NLWx04yUaa	no|`|ZTZBItU0aa	Funny. The left seem to have the same issue. I think as people gain a little more financial security, some smugness comes along, and they're tempted into the pitfalls of 'greed'. Not all, but enough to cause people to notice.<br>  It goes along with that saying "give them an inch and they take a mile". People start seeing money come their way and little by little they want some more, then some more, then some more. Sounds kinda like an addiction!  I think if the richer of us don't catch themselves, they fall into that trap.|`|ab406a9a5d69ca0d2cc95e30217f543aaa	One way for a political party to get more votes, is to try to get the poorer people to hate the richer people, because there are more poorer people, which means more votes.<br>  <br>  It's the same with the stupid news media. If the new media pretends to be on the side of the little guy, then more little guys will watch the TV news or read that newspaper. There are more little guys than powerful guys. Hence more sales, more viewership.<br>  <br>  Most people are normal, want a decent life, want to treat others decently, want to be treated decently. Not greedy.|`|AugnsMZ7aa	Reality is that business owners contribute to society and charitable organizations far beyond what most people understand.<br>  <br>  "Greedy" is a word meant for people who have their hand out with no willingness to work and or show appreciation for what others sacrifice in order to help them.|`|AA11121510	Ya de all be greedy muthers.  <br>  <br>  I be waitin by my mailbox for whitey's money.

It's taken a nosedive since the election!<br>  <br>  Harmony|`|xJmDP5NGaa	Yes and rightly so.....He plans to TAX the hell out of them to pay for these rewards he is handing out to his Corp. masters....oops I mean the "stimulus" pork package|`|MEReSvZeaa	We seem to have a lot of investment money parked on the sidelines waiting for "hope".|`|KZh3x4g9aa	ya think.tough dealing with a marxist...|`|6t76bgS3aa	I think so, for some reason they think socialism would be bad for business.  I'm not sure why, they obviously don't know much about the glorious example of North Korea and it's great leader.  Obama is ours, according to the media, even the sparrows are in awe of him.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	The people I know who have small businesses & make over $250,000 a year are making up lies to keep everything they can get. They have employess who even if paid better than most, they still have to watch their money. So these people who have so much are scaring their employess to think if Obama won the election they would lose their jobs. Seriously, if you had a business & you made $250,000 a year & had to pay $35,000 a year more in taxes would you give up what you had to make much less. Would you give up your nice cars, big house & privates schools if you have kids? No one is going to go out of business just because they can't get as much in tax refunds. The bigger businesses want us all sick & stressed out. Do you think the pharmecutical companies want us to go to yoga & feel peaceful & eat well & not need drugs. I do healing work to avoid being part of their trap. Your question is really bringing up a good subject that people were not talking about. This fear businesses have are that we would all find out how powerful we are to manifest the money we need without being dependent on them. I left my job years ago. My husband was going handyman work just helping older people or people from our spiritual center. He started getting customers & charging & we didn't need the factory he worked at any more. Everyone needs to get clear for our country to break the addiction to liars. Rush spreads the work for them & while only 20% of the country falls for him they are hurting themselves so much & blaiming the wrong people.|`|u23sBafTaa	I don't know as they are afraid of him personally , I think they are concerned he is just nuts !

(raise taxes, lower taxes, help banks, stop helping banks, help car companies, let 'em fail, provide universal health insurance, let the market provide health care, ....) and it'll get better, don't believe 'em.<br>  it ain't so.<br>  if it were really that easy, bush would have done it.<br>  maybe, if you hear an even amount of screaming on every side, you're getting it about right.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Petrified. Corporate welfare is over. Everybody with a push cart and two apples to sell was getting subsidies. Bail-outs were really bonuses. Looting was rampant. No liberal, no conservatives; just gangsters. The stock market's down, you say.. what are those stocks really worth. How many of these companies really produce a saleable product or service. Like farmers growing inedible corn and getting subsidies. Ethanol. I haven't  seen an ethanol station yet, but my taxes pay for them. GM HumVees; tell me who would buy that garbage except the bush administration, and at $120,000 each. Then scream bailout. Only in America, now they're bankrupt. Over.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	Paranoia runs ramped in America...it's a social disease.<br>  <br>  (Guess with half the nation in the army and the other half at home trying to cope it's not hard to see why).<br>  <br>  Does anyone know WTF they are doing or what they stand for anymore?

These guys are pretty incompetent but are able to hide this from the public by passing off the blame for failures to their underlings.  Many of them profit from things that would undoubtedly be considered unethical.  Most of these guys are also the ones directly responsible for crisis we are in today.  Those guys are terrified.  Their livelihoods are threatened by the new president and they have every reason to be afraid.|`|RCqG4z5Oaa	By skimming some of the answers you received it is very clear the people have no idea how jobs are created. They do not realize the money from the stock market investors keeps banks afloat, businesses up and running, food going to commodities markets, and on and on. The number one supporter of the Obama administration is none other than Berkshire/Hathaway who is primarily owned by one Warren Buffet. He invested in oil,  prayed that gasoline would go to 10 dollars a gallon but that went south on him. He lost billions. <br>  <br>  Businesses are terrified of him. Consider the people who work at the stock market that has a cap put on their wages, free country huh, get an education owe on your college loans and get a serious pay slice.<br>  <br>  I am not a Wall Street worker or investor but I do know our Presidents ideas are not going to work. History states this and so does the USSR.|`|SGwkPy62aa	Extremely and rightfully so.  As other have already done, and more are doing, I do not blame the business world for packing up and abandoning America.  If we don't get our money out of America now, Obama, Pelosi, and Reid are going to steal it all.|`|jVUEohsNaa	Yeah, electing a president because, "Hey, wouldn't it be fun to elect a BLACK man?" wasn't the best way to get a quality leader.<br>  <br>  NOBAMA!|`|2vtP7WS7aa	With the Dow dropping like a stone:yes.

I say scared s---- less is more accurate. Communist regimes always frighten capitalist socities.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	I hope so.

AA12104896	Don't generalize.<br>  <br>  People who have a lot can share because they have something to share.<br>  People who have a little can share because they know what it is like to have a little.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Both are equally willing to share....the rich just have more to give than the poor....that doesn't in ANY WAY mean that the poor don't give, though. The only people who seem unwilling to share are people who continually criticize others as 'lazy' and 'greedy'.....see: you.|`|JthubNIsaa	Greed is different in everyone.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	it is different for each person. Some people are a mixture of both or one or the other at different times. I call the rich people either generous/ philanthropic (liberal) or greedy (conservative) I understand both. But now that I am older & can see there is more that we can't see & that we have to work with in life. A prosperity consciousness will teach us all that we need to take care of the poor. By letting go we are able to recieve. Trying holding your breathe. You have to let go to get more air. Consevatives don't get it. They lie cheat & steal to get these people to go along & vote for them. Palin robbed tax payers of $7000 & was told to pay it back but I didn't see anything about it on this site. The words conservative & liberal answer you question if someone doesn't know what they mean just do a search & put the word define & the word in a search space to get yoru answer.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Interesting question.  If you ask a liberal than if you make more than $250,000 then you need to share it with everybody.

How do you categorize wealth? The child who gets 25.00 a month allowance thinks his/her parents are wealthy when in truth they are just getting by. <br>  <br>  The person making ten million a year bonus may consider themselves poor compared to the man making a billion dollars a year. <br>  <br>  We are all wealthy, and all poor, if you look at it from this perspective.<br>  We all give equally.<br>  <br>  To the man that has no home I am wealthy but I would be willing to help him.

We all have the freedom of speech to write on this question what we want to write, don't we? We all have our freedom. We are all safe. 9/11 wasn't Bush's fault. He was in office for a few months. And for war in Iraq opposers, you really don't understand what exactly we are fighting for.<br>  <br>  Obama on the other hand, has put us in the same amount of debt in 50 days as Bush had in 8 years. His ideas are socialistic, no matter what you read.  Government should not control everything, that is not how our country was founded, and it should stay that way. We all have the right to work as hard as we want, choose our doctors, and be free from the government's ball and chain. We have been that way for many, many years.

Unlike trash like the pseudo "Christian" Palins, the Obamas don't run off and leave their children unsupervised.  So there's unlikely to be any need for that.<br>  <br>  BTW: The incidence of unwed teenage mothers is HIGHER among right wing conservatives than the general population.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	IT does seem to mean that. If you are 18 you could not be charged under this law. However, be careful to investigate that there is not some OTHER law, say sexual assault in the second degree, for example, that covers it... I would really get an opinion from an attorney if you are going to do this. It would not cost that much and prison is not nice. Or so I hear.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	If it is consensual between them then yes, it would be legal, or would at least not violate this particular law.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	It means that a person isn't guilty of that specific offence (sexual assault in the third degree) if he's eg. 18 having sex with a 15 year old, but that doesn't necessarily meant that he wouldn't be committing a lower offence. In the UK for example, the main offence specifies that a person must be 18 to be guilty, but later it says that a 16 or 17 year old is still guilty but with a much lower maximum sentence.|`|ZTZBItU0aa	This is sexual assault in the THIRD degree.  It may be against the law in a different degree.|`|1KGXts5Daa	yep, that's what that particular section of the code is saying.

That's what change looks like.|`|uW8U5T8Jaa	People like cynthia show how dumb they are.<br>  Isn't the only real "change" we'll see is higher taxes and higher unemployment?<br>  DOes any intelligent person really think that these boneheaded "stimulus palns" and tax the "rich" plans will do anything but drive us into a Depression and that unemployment will continue to explode upward as the "rich" fire more workers to make up for higher taxes?|`|wwlb1lznaa	Jeez, he has only been in office for less than two months.

Thank goodness!|`|u23sBafTaa	Yeah, I love the chance to tell him to his face what I think of his hope and change !  It sucks so far I can't imagine four years of this !|`|1FBpObhpaa	I like the changes: a president that speaks the truth and does not try to hide the bad news; a president that actually is trying to do something to make things better for all Americans- not just the rich; a president who wants to focus on the war in Afghanistan where the real threat has always been; a president that finally realizes that private industry got us into this mess and that only a watchdog government can get us out of it; a president that is trying to regain a positive image of America through international cooperation - not isolationism; a president that sees that investing in job creation more important than just bailing out banks (Bush's sole approach to a worsening economy); and a transparent administration instead of one that seeks to hide bad press images.  How's that for some "stupid" answers?  Asking a question and expecting only "stupid answers" is the epitome of close-mindedness.  Remember that a closed mind only serves to make you appear to be ignorant.|`|bb2fb83f62e8d0f381f54d42036a5791aa	You need to get off Y/A and listen to Rush or Fox News they talk your language.

7f1TfskEaa	Well, eventually the war ends and the two sides have to get along.  Although, we dropped the atomic bomb on Japan, we also helped set up a stable Government and didn't punish the populace for the actions of the Gov't and military leadership.  McArthur did a lot to structure Japan for the future.|`|fLMCOSWdaa	It's garbage.  There always have been rules of war, and people have always been punished for breaking them. People who breach them are held in obloquy (good word, eh?) throughout history, like Cromwell, Tamburlaine, the Mongols, the Americans in Vietnam.  You know.  Savages.|`|yKLBdoigaa	He is sort of right. If you want something, and you can't take it by peace, you must take it through force, it's animalistic. <br>  <br>  The counter would just be that the innocent die for the needs and wants of the guility. To say that there is no moral for way, is to say that there is no reason for it in the first place. In other words, if one does not have morals or a set of things one is going to live by, there would have been no reason to go to war in the first place. Someone has to stand somewhere in the sand, to make a line to be crossed.

1d521d1ad2fdf38cda15eff82d979ed9aa	UPDATED AND EDITED (NEW REPLY):<br>  <br>  What work did you do? Unless you were a supervisor or manager or commissioned outside sales person you almost certainly, as a college student, wouldn't qualify to be exempt.<br>  <br>  Usually they don't tell exempt people in an offer letter the annual amount, they say you're exempt and usually they say what you make per pay period because if they say "$X per year" someone could claim they have a years contract.Sometimes they will say the hourly rate though, but they must tell you it's a salaried (exempt) position. Did you ever do extra hours other than this? If so you are entitled to back pay and overtime for ALL of the hours you worked during the entire 4-1/2 years..<br>  <br>  California is ungodly strict about paying people for their hours.<br>  <br>  In California they have to pay you to date within I believe 72 hours of your departure if you quit, the same day if you are fired or laid off. <br>  <br>  I've never seen a company not pay everything on the last day.  Did you bring this to your boss' attention before you quit? If so they have an extra problem. <br>  <br>  And since they have not responded to you that is highly unusual. Normally HR would be telling you right off the bat that you've misunderstood and their records clearly show you were exempt. They'd be in a rush to send you a copy of your offer letter because it would be right there in black and white And they would tell you that you have the right to see your records.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you send them certified mail return receipt requested and say you don't want to have to file a labor complaint but you aren't getting any answers, and you give them 5 days to give you the answer. If they respond, unless you are 100% satisfied, go file the complaint anyway. You don't have to pay anything to complain, and you probably aren't going to get a good recommendation from the boss anyway (you won't get a bad one, he's just going to say "you have to talk to HR" and HR will say "our policy is not to give references."), so have a coworker or someone else there who will give you a ref.|`|1KGXts5Daa	I can tell you, based on lengthy personal experience with a large employer (roughly 1000 employees) that they are probably correct.  Every time I challenged or questioned my pay (which I was more apt to during my first 6-8 years) I ended up either being paid correctly, or overpaid (which they never asked for back).<br>  <br>  You are certainly within your rights to pursue the matter as long as you which, but we're talking roughly 17 hours of pay???  I don't wish to offend by minimizing your salary, but even at $40/hr. that amounts to about $500 (after taxes).<br>  <br>  You will end up spending much more than that in time, energy and fees - only to learn that you were paid correctly.|`|f645ec028c19d84089f57f1c03e81a74aa	Where you paid the same amount on every paycheck, or did it vary based on the hours you submitted? If all the paychecks were the same, they were treating you as salaried and exempt. Salaried and exempt people are paid 86.67 hours per paycheck in the bi-monthly pay plan.|`|uzf7nuLnaa	If you live in the US and you are not an exempt employee they must pay you overtime and that makes what they are doing illegal.  Go online and file a complaint with the Department of Labor.  I hope you kept track of all your hours.  This company is in big trouble if they did this with all their employees.|`|dvgj6q6xaa	Contact your states Dept. of Labor. There should be a toll free number to file a complaint with them. What the company did is illegal and the state can fine them if they find in your favor which it sounds like they will.

They hope you'll never notice. Sometimes its just for a few minutes, then again it can be several hours, such as is your case.<br>  <br>  Best advice is send a certified letter to them and give a specific deadline for an answer, usually 25 - 30 days. After that period of time, seek the advice of an attorney. Odds are you  are not the only employee with this issue.

We all ended up in Alabama and had to go to the POST in Alabama.<br>  Some states will accept cross transfers some will not?<br>  Best route is gt hired and go to academy. If you pay to go it could cost you $1,500 to $6,000 depending on length of academy.|`|33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	Depends on the jurisdiction. <br>  <br>  Graduating the the academy class often comes with a job offer, but NOT ALWAYS. Just the other day, there was a news item about these graduating police cadets were "saved" when Obama's stimulus funds means they will be hired by the police dept after all. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, unless you majored in criminology or had military experience in law enforcement, going to the police academy is the only way you'll get the proper training. <br>  <br>  Time to do more research!|`|qZ0310yVaa	call the police|`|T2WPvUc1aa	It depends on where you live. I know how it is in Texas. Most smaller departments don't have a lot of money in their budgets, and cannot afford to pay for people to attend the academy. They are looking for people who are already TCLEOSE certified. Texas has a lot of community college police academies for this purpose. I paid and attended a community college police academy. <br>  However, some of the larger departments will make you go through their academy even if you are already certified. I understand that Houston is this way. Some departments may accept applications for certified officers who will go straight into training under the FTO (Field Training Officer) program, or recruits who will have to attend the academy. In any case, you would have a lot more options for employment if you go to the academy and get certified, than trying to apply and get accepted into an academy. <br>  I don't know how it is where you live, but a lot of the college academies here have day and night programs. If you work during the day you can go to school at night. The only disadvantage of this is that you are going four hours per day instead of eight. This makes the academy nearly ten months long, instead of just over four months.|`|JGeh7RTaaa	It depends on the department, usually bigger departments have their own academy training and they usually want you to go to that, so they will pay for you to go, smaller departments usually want someone that has the training already so it just depends on what type of department you want to work for, if you have a department in mind they will tell you want they want|`|J7M7FP02aa	I'm not sure this might help though : <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvanC_Ua7YofLUEse_z4m4fsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307133209AAEA2Yv">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7Uxp1WkRaa	You must complete the police academy training one way or another unltess you have skills learned in the armed foreces or something simuilari.
