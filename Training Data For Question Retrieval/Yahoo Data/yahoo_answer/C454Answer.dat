wka5mD9Yaa	The elephants have many excellent, endearing qualities and since it's a Dr. Seuss print, try it in your Childen/Creativity gua in thinking Feng Shui. That's typically on the right wall as you look into the room - in many/most books on the subject. That's a good place for it since it's white, too. There are many really good books out there. A fantastic, very thorough one, is Feng Shui and Health by Nancy SantoPietro. <br>  <br>  There's tiny ceramic elephant on my computer tower to remind me to remember... and another much larger one, a planter, next to my piano. These are both dark brownish green so are placed for their color while also reminding me to stay focused, be less forgetful or absent minded. <br>  <br>  Whatever brings you joy is good Feng Shui for you. Have fun in making your choices and watch that really good chi start flowing your way!

You can put it out side in the summer, which will let it gain strength, before the last frost stop watering it, and bring it inside. About November you can start watering it, place it in a warm location where it will get good light and soon you will have more blooms.

The problem with this is that it can weaken a fire place chimney. I wonder too if it may cause damage to a foundation as well. You could use string instead, suspended from the top to the ground. But I think a neat trellis is the way to go.

Ist der Befall sehr ausgebreitet, sollte man die Sanierung einer Fachfirma überlassen und den Vermieter benachrichtigen. Um zu kl?ren, wer für den Schimmelbefall verantwortlich ist, müssen sowieso meist Experten zu Rate gezogen werden. Es hilft Ihnen und Ihrer Gesundheit nicht, wenn durch einen baulichen Mangel immer wieder ein Befall auftritt. Ratschl?ge zu dieser Problematik geben Ihnen die Rechtsberatungsstellen der Verbraucherzentralen.<br>  <a href="http://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/</a><br>  Liegt nur ein kleiner, überschaubarer Befall des Untergrundes vor, so kann man wie folgt vorgehen:<br>  Den Putz ausschlagen,(aber da es sich um eine Bauliche ma?nahme handelt rück Sprache mit dem Vermieter )  so tief der Pilz ins Mauerwerk vorgedrungen ist. Erst wenn das Mauerwerk sauber und trocken ist, mit einer Bürste lose Teile entfernen und mit einem Schimmelmittel desinfizieren.<br>  Schimmel Entferner Jati?

Das Halten einer abgesenkten Durchschnittstemperatur ist sparsamer.<br>     Innentüren zwischen unterschiedlich beheizten R?umen tags und nachts geschlossen halten.<br>     Das kalte Schlafzimmer niemals vom Wohnraum aus mitheizen. Dies kann Schimmel zur Folge haben. <br>  <br>  Richtig querlüften<br>  <br>   Von drinnen nach drau?en lüften. (w?rmere = feuchtere Luft raus, dafür k?ltere = trockenere hinein)<br>   Quer durch die Wohnung lüften (Querlüften, mind. zwei gegenüberliegende Fenster)<br>     Bei jedem Wetter, auch bei Regen lüften. Kalte Au?enluft ist trockener als die warme Zimmerluft.<br>    Je kühler die Zimmertemperatur, desto ?fter muss gelüftet werden.<br>    Je k?lter es drau?en ist, desto kürzer muss gelüftet werden.<br>    Die Fenster kurzzeitig (wenige Minuten sind ausreichend) ganz ?ffnen (Sto?lüften). Kippstellung ist wirkungslos, verschwendet Heizenergie, kann u.U. Schimmelbildung f?rdern.<br>   Bei dichten Isolierglasfenstern h?ufiger lüften.<br>     Innenb?der brauchen regelm??ig eine Zwangslüftung (Lüfter, z.B. ans Licht gekoppelt) <br>  <br>  Richtiger Lüftungszeitpunkt<br>  <br>   Morgens einmal kompletten Luftwechsel durchführen, Durchzug machen, in jedem Zimmer das Fenster weit ?ffnen.<br>     Vormittags und nachmittags nochmals die Zimmer lüften, in denen sich Personen aufgehalten haben.<br>    Abends wieder einen kompletten Luftwechsel inklusive Schlafzimmer vornehmen.<br>    Bei Abwesenheit (Berufst?tigkeit) am Tage reicht es, morgens und abends zu lüften. <br>  <br>  Richtige Lüftungsdauer<br>  <br>    Die n?tige Lüftungszeit ist vom Unterschied von der Innen- zur Au?entemperatur und dem Wind abh?ngig. Selbst bei Windstille und geringem Temperaturunterschied reichen in der Regel wenige Minuten Sto?lüftung aus.

Beurteilen kann das nur ein Sachverst?ndiger vor Ort!|`|nSxwBvZjaa	Es handelt sich hier wahrscheinlich um den klassischen Schwarzschimmel, für dessen Enstehung es verschiedene Ursachen gibt.<br>  Hauptursache ist falsches Lüften in Verbindung mit hoher Luftfeuchtigkeit und organischem Untergrund z.B.

Eine weitere Ursache kann sein,d as es sich z.B. um eine schlecht,-oder unged?mmte Aussenwand handelt, wenn dann noch ein Schrank an der Wand steht bildet sich schnell Schimmel.<br>  Man muss einfach die Ursachen finden.

ghSNaUOOaa	BLACKHOLE|`|okX7dyl0aa	The best is almost always expensive!!!<br>  <br>  Robot<br>  <br>  iRobot Create<br>  <br>  "From the company that brought you the Roomba vacuum cleaner comes a robot designed for students, geeks and other 'bot lovers to create their own programmes. See it in action here fetching beer from the fridge or even being controlled by a hamster. Genius.''<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  Best Vacuum Cleaner: Hyla<br>  <br>  Consumer Reports recently rated different vacuum cleaners. Once again, they didn't test he best products on the market, only the best selling. Why? Consumer Reports doesn't test products that are not readily available in the marketplace.<br>  <br>  The best vacuum cleaner on the market today based on our testing is the Hyla. (Hyla website) This patented machine (nothing else like it in the marketplace) is not only a wet and dry vacuum but also an air purifier. What makes this unit unique is the water separator.  Older water filtration vacuum technology such as that found in Rainbow vacuum cleaners requires constant cleaning, is prone to break down, and does not keep fine dust from re-entering the room.  We tested the air exiting the Hyla NST vacuum for particles as small as .001 with a laser using a negative air return and found that the Hyla when used as an air purifier (over 100 CFM) could remove virtually all airborne contaminants, even second hand smoke. (Over 99.99% down to .01 micron).  The Hyla people don’t even tout this fact, they just tout the fact the air exiting the unit smells clean and fresh, unlike bag vacuums (even HEPA bag vacuums) which allow 50% or more of airborne contaminants back into the air. Why? Because 80% of airborne contaminants are smaller than .3 microns, and HEPA technology is only effective for particles down to .3 microns. Things like viruses, molds, bacteria, and smoke go right through a HEPA filter.  That is most unfortunate for those who suffer from asthma or allergies. Perhaps that is why the American Lung Association has this to say about conventional bag vacuums:<br>  <br>  Vacuum cleaners stir up dust and allergens in the air. A vacuum cleaner with an air filter or a central vacuum cleaner with a collection bag outside the home may be of limited value. Anyone with asthma or allergies should avoid vacuuming. If vacuuming must be done, a dust mask may help.|`|imaeeL9Naa	Dyson DC17.  It's the best vaccum i've ever used.

Allerdings wenn in der Nachbarschaft die G?rten oder Komposthaufen mit Unkraut voll sind, dann wirst du immer ein Problem mit Unkraut haben, da der Samen unwillkürlich verstreut wird.  Du musst dann st?ndig Unkraut j?ten oder wenn es zu viel wird, mit Unkrauf-Ex arbeiten. <br>  <br>  Unser Bekannter hat es kürzlich so gemacht, erst das Unkraut Ex drauf und dann die Stellen nachges?t.

The white cap bottom goes under the washer.  Most people make the mistake of putting it with the ridge line down, I have always found that if you place the ridge line up the cap will snap on better.  <br>  <br>  As far as the nut not coming off when it comes time to take the toilet up again, it will.  The worst case is that you have to buy a new set of bolts the next time you go to reset your toilet.   When I set a toilet i go so far as to caulk around the bottom of it.  Ask yourself how often have you removed your toilet in the past?  Most people I know only do it for a new floor.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	You cut them off with a hacksaw(a close quarters hacksaw works best).  <br>  <a href="http://www.thefind.com/hardware/info-close-quarter-hacksaw" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefind.com/hardware/info-clo...</a><br>  You can get one in the plumbing section at home depot.The nuts are removable even after you cut them off.

The refrigerant is what is causing Global Warming, and destroying the Earths ozone layer that protects us from the sun's radiation.|`|dKq7DZkbaa	You really need to call and ask the city about removal, because in some states it is required that you hire a professional to remove the refrigerant and label the refrigerator properly before they will accept it at the dump.

AA11305474	I'm not sure what kind of information you seek but here are some pointers.  You want guaged brick which means all of the bricks are the same height.  That is because some bricks that you can get are differing heights and can pose trip hazards once installed.  You also do not want to use full sized bricks because they are higher than other flooring and won't match up to vinyl, carpet, tile or wood flooring in adjoining rooms.  You also want to seal the brick once it is installed as brick is porous and liquids spilled on it will soak into the brick and stain it.|`|WTy8I1Nvaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Bricks are very easy to install.

There is even a species that grows as far north as Wisconsin, where I live.<br>  <br>  Running bamboo is invasive and many home-owners consider it a weed. This bamboo spreads by underground rhizomes and can spread quickly. Install root barriers to prevent bamboo growth in unwanted areas.

16vMIGPiaa	I personally clean off my grates as best I can with a broken piece of brick or with a BBQ cleaning block, wipe them down with a rag, and spray with PAM.<br>  I don't like the taste of the rust, and try hard to not end up with bits of it in my food.<br>  <br>  For delicate foods, I actually cover the grates with aluminum foil.|`|1c264470699c75f9ef21a75b4682539eaa	Iron rust is a harbinger of bacteria. Tetanus is the most common. Heating the grates will kill the bacteria,but, will not stop the 'nest' from re-forming. Iron likes to be saturated/tempered with peanut oil. Scrub this surface occasionally with a paste of equal parts of salt and oil to keep it sharply smooth and clean without rust forming. This is very akin to tempering/ maintaing, a cast-iron skillet. When performed on a monthly basis, healthy satisfaction is guaranteed.|`|2ab81416fb3885d06ec6b6c41274305eaa	Go out in the yard and lay down some old newspapers. Buy a can of Over Cleaner.

yFG0NhD4aa	Was this a house you rented, or owned?<br>  <br>  1.  RENTAL:  Is this a house you rented then?  If so, and you had a verbal agreement with the landlord, you need to hold him to that.  Verbal agreements in the US are binding in the court of law (depending on which side is more credible and if you had a witness to the verbal agreement).  You really need a paper trail for things.  I don't trust verbal agreements because of things like this!!!<br>  2.  SALE w/ a realtor or attorney: They BETTER have paper work for you!  In Indiana, we can not do a sale without an offer to purchase with dates on it.  You need to make sure that whoever may represent you (realtor or attorney who drew up paperwork) that they have their dates right or they could get in trouble (if you persued the issue) as well as the buyer of your home if they moved in too soon.<br>    If you and the buyer made a verbal agreement and the realtors didn't know it and dates don't match, then in court, the <br>  3.  SALE W/ LANDCONTRACT:  You better have something in writing.  And, do NOT deed the house in just the new owners name is you still have a loan on the property, you will hurt later.

cfdAM3Nmaa	DO NOT GET ONE!<br>  <br>  I can tell you from personal experience, they are a pile of rubbish.<br>  <br>  It takes FOREVER to do a load in one of these.  They aren't that efficient at drying your clothing.  Also, if you wash a full load of clothes there isn't enough room to properly tumble dry the clothes and they come out wrinkled and often times still damp, even after 4 hours of running the machine.  With the cost of electricity, you will be paying enormous power bills for not so great laundry. <br>  <br>  If you have limited space I recommend either getting one of those stack  washer/dryer sets or getting a front load machine and hang drying your laundry.  <br>  <br>  |`|zdBCppaTaa	If you have a very small living space, then that combo is perfect for close quarters, a real space and time saver.<br>  However, having a two in one has it's drawbacks. If one ore more of the components breaks down or is in need of repair, you will be without a washer AND a dryer as opposed to just having one or the other out of service. Also, If a portion of the washer dryer is beyond repair, you will have to purchase a brand new one. Also, the hookups in your house may not be compatible or it may cost you to have your washer dryer hookup converted to use the new appliance. |`|EfcS6HwJaa	I have seen those and thought it was a cool idea.

I don't know how he would have done it but you have to investigate before accusing.  Find your meter and your neighbors meter.  They are probably all in one group.  You can usually see them spinning measuring your usage.  If yours is spinning and his is not then I would get an electrician and landlord involved.  You could also test if shutting off all your power at your main breaker disrupts your neighbors power.

VWLtJoX2aa	Your house is limited only by your breaker box, you can draw a maximum of 100 amps without blowing the breakers.  You do not want everything on one breaker but theoretically you could.  You can also add more breakers without removing the other two if you have room.  Perhaps you need a new box that can hold more breakers.<br>  I can't believe that everything in your house runs off from only 2 breakers.  My breaker box has 20 different breakers, I don't know what the total amps is.  Time to upgrade!|`|4G41Z3RJaa	The limit for 100 AMP service is not the breakers in the box, but the wire leading from the pole to the house.  I am not sure why you would have different AMP breakers, but it is not something that I would play with for safety reasons.  I would get a couple of estimates from qualified electricians on th cost of upgrading you service to 100 AMPS.|`|jcauTPLZaa	Do you mean you have 2 panels inside the house? One at 60 and one at 40? Or are both the breakers in the same panel? I have seen a lot of weird things in my time as an electrician, but I have never seen two different amp main breakers in the same panel. You would have a 60 amp service. I would pay a little extra and go with a 200 amp 42 circuit panel.
nk9bT6HBaa	With what you have used already, you probably have already used carbon tetrachloride in one of those spotting agents.  This is NOT a good thing.  Carbon tetrachloride is an optical brightener that can potentially open up dye lots in the carpet.  This can set in spots or bleach out the carpet.  To remove the spot, you first need to stop adding chemicals.  for the time being, keep the room as dark as possible.  This will prevent the brightening agents that are already in the carpet from doing more damage, as the residue's ill effects are accelerated by light.  At this point, things are a bit bleak, but your best bet is to start with a white towel that is damp with non-ammonia windex. Rub in a circle and blot with a dry rag. Next, get another white rag damp with isopropyl alchohol.  Place on the spot and go over the rag with a steam iron on medium.  Be careful not to burn the carpet.  If the color is transferring to the rag, that's a good sign.  Keep going, using clean rags as needed.  Between rags, blot with a dry one.  If the dye is not transferring, your best bet is to call in a specialist.  At this point, a professional cleaning probably won't suffice, as there isn't an issue of removing the soil, but of the carpet itself changing color... you should instead go with a bonded insert.  Hope this is helpful.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	First use some cold cream and a wet wash cloth to remove the make-up. Rinse your wash cloth and put some dishwashing liquid on it to get the cold cream off.

Peppers definitely will produce fruit every year.  I have a habanero that is five years old and still producing heavily.  If a tomato will produce next year is decided by if it is a determinate or indeterminate variety, and of course, whether or not it froze during the winter.  A true determinate tomato will not produce much of anything past its genetic time table.  An indeterminate plant will produce steadily in a frost free climate until it usually succumbs to disease.|`|YMwUpBIAaa	No. They are annuals in most states. They die at frost and dont come back up.

qEqMRTQkaa	You need to dig a ditch, put in perforated drain pipe and get it to flow someplace lower.  Then just fill the ditch back in with #2 gravel.|`|UQWusO1waa	google " french drain"|`|1b6c195ba207883a224264d44c013600aa	A french drain should work at this location.  You'll need to dig a 12" wide x 18" deep ditch in front of your garage door, and line this ditch with a strip of 5 ft. wide geo-textile filter fabric. Beyond this ditch, you will also need a trench to lay a solid wall pipe that will conduct water from the french drain.  Since the driveway slopes, you should also have a lower place away from the garage where the end of the solid drain pipe can daylight, and any water from the french drain can flow  onto the surface. <br>  <br>  Place and compacting about 6" of 3/4" dia. crushed gravel in the bottom of both the french drain area and trench, sloping away from the house a minimum of 1/8" per foot.  Place a perforated PVC schedule 40 4" dia. pipe on the gravel in the french drain, sloping 1/8"/foot down to solid wall drain pipe.  The holes in the perf pipe should face down. Connect the solid wall pvc pipe to the perf pipe with a fitting and solvent weld. Also slope the solid wall pipe at 1/8"/ft minimum.  Fill around and above the pipes with gravel, up to a point 6" below the adjacent ground surface.  <br>  <br>  At the french drain, fold the geotextile fabric across the top of the gravel, double thickness across the top.  You can now cover the french drain with driveway gravel, and the solid wall trench with sod or soil.  <br>  <br>  Since this is a small area, use PVC sched 40 piping instead of the flexible perforated piping.  The flexible piping will crush under vehicle weight unless the gravel is compacted properly with a pneumatic tamper.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	At home centers you can get channel basin and grill cover. It is  plastic about 5'' inches wide and 6 inches deep.  You would span in front of the garage door and into an inexpensive pvc pipe.  It is fair inexpensive at about $5 a foot.  with out seeing the terrain its hard to tell you were to drain it to.. A french drain will not work when the ground is frozen. you will also have to make sure the water can not freeze in the drain.

Gladiolas, begonias, liatris, caladiums, elephant ear, dahlias, ranunculus, etc. are just a few of them. The ones that are perennial in your zone can be planted as soon s the ground thaws. For the annual bulbs you need to wait until you are sure there won't be another frost. <br>  <br>  Another option is that they are selling bulbs that have been chilled in cold storage over the winter. In that case, it is just fine to plant them now, and while they might bloom a little late, they should still bloom nicely this spring.|`|kYcRLr0Naa	Some bulbs need to be planted before the ground freezes while others cannot be planted until the ground thaws. You need to get a book to read up on which ones fall into each category. Here in NY I plant dahlias and lilies and gladiolas in the spring time. The packaging should tell you when to plant them. You can even start them in pots before the last frost if you're in a cold zone like I am. I do this with my dahlia tubers to get them started. You'll have to ask around in your area to find out what to plant when but Cosco should have someone who knows something about this.
h7qkIGsKaa	Not if you want to do it properly.  Undercoat does two things.  It is softer and acts as a cushion against chipping and second it acts like a non-slip rubber coat between to hard shiny gloss surfaces.  <br>  <br>  So yes you can gloss over gloss, but the paint may chip, likely will not cover very well, and almost certainly when you come to rub it down in the future it will peel off rather than sand down.<br>  <br>  Sanding down first will help the paint adhere, but not stop chipping, peeling next time etc.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes, so long as you sandpaper it all over first.|`|AA11982228	It does need to be de-glossed first.  But, sanding (as mentioned in other replies) is messy and time-consuming.  Use a product called "De-Glosser".  It's a liquid that you can find in any paint department.  It's rubbed on the walls no more than 30 minutes prior to repainting.  It's a bit smelly, but cheap, effective and alot easier.|`|T1lqlNrmaa	if you paint gloss on top of gloss it will peel off after a while, you can either give it a light rub down with some 240 grit wet and dry paper ( 80 grit sandpaper will scratch and ruin the paint) or you can recoat with undercoat then re-gloss. i would just give it a light abrade ( best way to know how much to rub off is to rub the shine off the paint this will give you a good key for the new gloss.|`|Vv465eJMaa	It is one slippery surface onto another slippery surface,so it slides down rather than grips onto first gloss.<br>  So if you can't be bothered to sand down the area to make a the gloss grip,than paint the old gloss very roughly with matt emulsion.It dries quickly and gives a bit of grip for the new gloss|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Yes it's just like putting on a second coat of gloss paint as long as they are both the same type of paint.

Beware of products on the internet that claim to guarantee to remove stains as these will be solvents that will remove the finish and this will then need replacing.<br>  <br>  The only truly successful way of restoring this is to have the area recoloured to match and this cannot be done with DIY products.<br>  Call a leather specialist in your area and get him/her to do a professional job. It will be worth it in the long run.<br>  <br>  Once done use a quality leather protector that has UV protection in it to help stop it happening again.

The kitchen tap & bath cold tap are usually supplied by the mains BEFORE if gets up to the loft. <br>  <br>  Then look for any stopcocks/valves coming out which may be partially closed. Also look to see if there is any obvious blockage in the feed to the cold taps & hot tank...<br>  <br>  EDIT: The way to shift any airlock is to get a hosepipe between the mains cold and the slow-running tap. Turn both on, and the higher mains pressure blows the airlock up into the storage tank. Takes 30 secs or so, but it's best to have two people doing this...|`|2hEnSodJaa	So your problem only affects some but not all water taps in your house so the problem is in the house somewhere so trace the cold line from where the water enters the house and follow all branches of it to see where a drop in pressure may be such as a partly closed shut off valve or bent line etc you never said if you are on a well of your own or city system, was this a sudden problem or slowly occurred, what type of pipes do you have?  copper,plastic, iron whats the diameter?  how old are the pipes? What size and how high is the building you live in? it would help to put every bit of info for better understanding, your problem is really an easy one to fix|`|PN7XMglOaa	It's not the pipes , you have a bad regulator , call a plumber , it's not cheap , expect to pay  around $350|`|AA10092387	Yes it sounds like your main water supply coming into you house has low pressure for some reason.

G4TJ8nibaa	I am assuming that you have 3 wires a black, a red and a green. If this is the case go to the hardware store and get a roll of white electrical tape, 2 new single phase breakers and a receptacle rated the same as the breakers. Open your panel and remove the wires from the double breaker. Attach the black wire to one of the new breakers. Install both breakers (you will have a spare for later). Wrap tape around the red wire to identify it as a neutral. Attach the now white wire to the bus bar with the other white wires. leave the neutral alone here. At the outlet location wrap the red again with the tape to identify it as a neutral. Wire as usual for a 120VAC outlet.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	You can use the existing wiring just don't use green as neutral. Take out your double (208v)breaker and replace it with a 15 or 20 amp single breaker .  Connect the black to the new breaker. mark the red wire with something white and connect it to the ground bar. mark the red wire on the outlet side with white too.The red is now the neutral.  Keep your green wire as ground. You now have a 120v connection. The neutral and ground go to the same place in the panel so your green wire technically could of been neutral but then you would not have a ground... unlike what was said before this setup is very safe. you are using a heavier wire than required and that's a good thing.|`|8vfCRg7Caa	honestly i dont think its safe either way.|`|3W18HDxxaa	no<br>   got  to the switch box turn the breaker off  remove  the red wire <br>   from the breaker  tape it up <br>   then use the black and white wires for 110v and the green for ground <br>   and tape the red wire up at the out let|`|pjGueC4xaa	William B is absolutely correct, AND it's safe
x86mC8yyaa	I would allow at least 18ins for round the edges, as with a biggish pond like this it's quite hard to get the heavy liner exactly in the right place, and once the water starts going in it's too heavy to do anything about it as it flattens out the liner to the sides of the pond. If you are planning to put flagstones round the edges, the liner can go under the stones to make a secure edge. The offcuts of liner are very useful for all sorts of applications where you need pieces of strong waterproof material.

Some trees will not tolerate any kind of treatments to their bark. I don't know why you can't photograph the tree unless you are afraid of the spirits of the tree being captured in the photograph. LOL The rocks or stones will survive.|`|dxpDxpHYaa	yes. it is illegal. if you get caught, you will recieve the death penalty. it is seriously a huge crime. what government doesn't tell you is that they have secret little men hiding under the trees who will come out and shoot you with bebe guns. If you photograph them, and develop the photos, all you will see is little men...EVERYWHERE! Believe me i live in PA, no lie.|`|HM5Zd2Oiaa	I would watch out in PCP. They have strict rules about every little thing. Just ask at the guard shack or the club house. I understand why you might want to paint the stone.. but the tree? its gods precious life. dont do it.
AA11759897	I had this problem on a job, the house in question was built on a concrete raft as the ground was unstable when the place was built. The main had burst at the point that it entered the dwelling the copper pipe went into a clay pipe duct and had chafed on the edge of the pipe. The water board will trace the main and give you some guidance to the point of entry. You are normally able to see signs on the surface  when water is leaking and you also should be hearing a noise within the property when things are quiet. <br>  As for claiming, Insurance companies tend to pay for the damage done but not for the repair. A new water main is not that expensive, the pipe is plastic now and the main expense is the excavation across the garden ( 30"  750 mm below surface min. ), you could just renew it to your boundary and join onto the existing pipe. If its an old lead main then the water board will normally connect it free as a lead renewal. <br>  The other point you asked you can join into the cold water pipework at any point within the house so don't think that you have to get back to the existing main internal stop tap all you do then is to cap the old supply point at the stop tap.
VWLtJoX2aa	Brands don't mean what the used to.  Frigidaire, Maytag, GE, Whirlpool, KitchenAid...<br>  <br>  Do some research, find some consumer reviews by model number.  Good luck.|`|YuXklGUlaa	after repairing appl for 38 years i have found maytag,whirlpool to be some of the best,,g.e. is ok but parts are at least 2-3 times more expensive than whirlpool|`|6uEmRe7Naa	I would advise you to do a little research. There are several good brands out there. There are also several different types and styles of appliances, especially when it comes to refrigerators and stoves. Some brands are known for better specifications than others. Is there anything else you need to take into consideration other than the size? You may want to think about energy and possible types and styles.|`|VDYHm9Yraa	I think you can always do ok with GE, but shop around and think about how you use the kitchen. What features do you want in terms of programming, reheating, timers, ease of use of the handles, etc. What do you not like about your current appliances?|`|AA10092387	If you stick with Whirlpool, or GE you will come out ok.
FxAD44Moaa	all year.. alot of effort especially since i'm a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  but, for myself it's very zen..  it's fun..  a break from the monotomy of work and life.<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  you won't  know until you try!<br>  <br>  and just do it..   the worst can  happen is that you kill everything OR nothing grows... <br>  <br>  just doing something different is a great way to break out....     it's good for exercise and the mentalilty!<br>  <br>  who knows.. maybe you can create a blog about your endeavors and experiences!   (and include pictures!   not just of the garden but videos too and well meals that come from this opportunity)<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm sure it'll be fun let alone an interesting effort!|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	I definitely agree with the first answer.  I will add that the amount of time necessary really depends upon the size of your garden and the type of stuff you wish to grow.  And, the work is mostly concentrated at the beginning of the season when you have to prep the area, toil, til and work fertilizers etc.<br>  Then alot of the work is centered on maintaining the garden, such as watering and weeding.  You can use certain tools to control things like weeds (lay own ground covers) and save some work.  I would suggest starting off small.|`|NMK7Z66Yaa	I suggest starting off small and making sure to watch the sun light on the ground as it passes through out the day so you know the best place to put the garden. The amount of time it will all take really depends on the size and what you are growing. I generally stick to tomatoes, peppers of different types and okra if I want a low maintenance garden. The Okra grows much faster in the warmer climates so it requires more frequent attention. <br>  <br>  The hardest part of gardening is keeping the grass and weeds out of the garden once everything starts to grow, especially with spices. <br>  So I grow my spices in the back flower bed against the house away from the threat of grass and weeds.<br>  <br>  Being a new gardener you may want to start with starter plants instead of seeds. This takes at least a few weeks off of your wait to see progress. But whatever you do be sure to wait until after the last frost of the year.
