GuOJIftAaa	Ok, what I do is bathe the rat in warm water making sure his tail is getting soaked which makes the dirt loosen up. Then, I take a toothbrush with olive oil and scrub from the base to the tip, never from tip to base since the little hairs will get pushed. Then that usually takes most of it off. Then I grab the tail with a towel and pull down gently a few times and that usually gets 99% of the tail crud. You could go to goosemoose.com for more help. Just type "tail cleaning" in the search box and you should get some useful help.   Good luck at the rats show! Hope you win!|`|Hhifw93laa	there's no way to do it with out hurting him. you should do it quickly and after words put a soothing lotion on his tail it will be over before he knows it and he wont reamber it the next day do it soon and quick have fun at the rat show have a great day and God bless|`|CvLwS9p5aa	hold the rat's tail in a sink of warm water and rub it gently with your finger or scrub it gently with a tooothbrush|`|A2IDiIpIaa	They aren't dead, that is just dirt.  Give him a bath, most rats like it or don't mind it here is a great website for all ratty goodness.   http://www.dapper.com.au/articles.htm li...|`|X1LlP5KPaa	You could always try baby wipes.    -Any by the way, if you don't have one, get the rat a companion.  Rats need cage-mates.  They get lonely and unhappy if they are alone all the time.  Your company isn't the same as a same-species constant companion.
70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Your kitty probably had feline rhinotracheitis,or feline calicivirus,which are respiratory viruses.Many cats who suffer from it will have a watery eye for the rest of their lives. I have a cat who had it and her eye waters off and on.He did not catch a cold from you - that is impossible.He does not have distemper. Cats with feline distemper are extremely ill and have bloody diarrhea. I think the cat will be fine.    http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    Oh,and listen to Austin - the Lysine is great stuff. You can give up to 500 mgs. twice a day. It's with the vitamins. Ask your vet about it.|`|LVPYnB6gaa	your cat cant pick up your cold..two different viruses. he probably is just getting sick himself, when i got my kitten from the shelter he had an upper respiratory infection. he had discharge from the eye and was acting up a bit. and even if your cat had distemper it doesn't mean our house is cursed. you can get another cat and he'll be fine.. but its probably not going to lead to that so don't worry. he probably has URI (what i told you bout earlier) the doctor is going to give him some medication and he will be fine in about 2 weeks...|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	dont get ahead of yourself, it is probably just an upper respitory infection some antibiotics will cure it.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	i dont now i do not work at a vet...|`|CL5Plgekaa	Your house will be full of disease now. You'll need to have your house fumigated. Sorry to advise you of bad news.|`|QC6oBb2iaa	My cats throw up all the time.  It could just be a hairball he can't get up.  As far as the watery eye, I have one cat that has feline herpes.  This causes him to have watery eyes.  It's probably nothing to worry about.  Unless you've seen behavior changes, it's most likely not distemper.|`|ppQ8lqKeaa	No, it's not distemper, and his problem is not related to your cold. Cats and humans do not generally pass viruses back and forth.     Your cat has the equivalent of a minor upper respiratory infection. It may be exaggerated by stress--he's been through a lot.     You need to go to the drug store, and get a bottle of a dietary supplement (in the dietary supplements section for humans). It is called Lysine. Give the cat about a half tablet. Simply grind it up, using the back of a spoon, and put it in something really yummy, like canned tuna.     The cat will probably show signs of improvement almost immediately.     If you've got the appointment with the vet, you might want to follow through. But if you can't really afford it, just try the Lysine and see if there isn't an immediate improvement.     If there is, give him a half tablet, morning and night, for three or four days, and do this again, in the future, if the symptom re-appears.     Good luck!.
AA11992723	I made peanut butter cookies with low fat all natural pb and both my dogs loved them as much as regular pb. You just mix a few tablespoons of the PB with 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup 1% or 2% milk. Add a splash of water and a pinch of baking powder. You can also add 1 egg if you want sometimes I do or sometimes I leave it out. Add more flour if it's sticky. Make whatever shapes you want about a teaspoon size on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 375F for 20 mins or until they are as baked as you want.    If that's too fatty...you can always just buy dehydrated no sugar added fruit like apples and bananas my dogs love them i find them in the regular supermarket.|`|Z3YL5UY1aa	Here is an easy and cheap one.  Take a can of pumpkin - not with the spices in it - just plain pumpkin.  Take a scoop like a mellon scoop and a teaspoon, and put them on a small tray that will fit in your freezer.  Once they are frozen, you can take them off the tray and keep in a freezer bag in the freezer.  When you want to give a treat, take out one or two of the "pumpkin balls" and let them thaw slightly.  The dogs love these.  I have two labs that will beg for this easy, low fat treat.
YBcB0732aa	What kind of tick was it? A dog tick, deer tick, ..ect    "Some owners have described Lyme-infected cats as being in a "zombie like trance". Often, Lyme disease is only diagnosed because the owner notices a tick or a tick bite on the cat; otherwise the symptoms are ambiguous and can be mistaken for other illnesses. Studies of cats deliberately infected with Lyme disease showed that some show no symptoms at all! According to American researchers, infected ticks do not start to transmit the bacteria until they have been sucking a host's blood for 10-12 hours which is why it is important to remove ticks as soon as possible. "    "The main guidelines used by US cat owners in Lyme-affected areas are:        * does your cat show evidence of a tick-bite?      * has the cat been exposed to ticks in grassland or woodland where the tick's main hosts are present or an area where cases of Lyme disease have been reported?      * is the cat suffering from lameness, painful joints, lethargy, anorexia or low-grade fever?      * does a bloodtest reveal antibodies to the Lyme bacteria?      * does an analysis of the offending tick (if it was removed from the cat and kept in a jar) reveal Borrelia bacteria?      * do symptoms quickly subside when antibiotics are given?     Even if the answer to all of these is yes, it is still not conclusive proof that Lyme disease is causing the illness since cats in some areas have high antibody levels due to past exposure to Borrelia; but American vets believe it is worthwhile having a blood test done any time Lyme disease is suspected even if this serves only to rule out Borrelia infection as the cause of the cat's symptoms.    Although Lyme disease does not appear to pose a major threat to cats, who seem more resistant to it than humans or dogs, its most dangerous feature is that it may go unrecognised and undiagnosed. "|`|8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	Your cat is not well.  It may be a tick borne infection your cat is suffering from.  What matters is that the cat gets to the vet.  You are describing a male who may have difficulty eliminating.  That is an emergency.  His thrid eyelids are exposed which is an clinical indictation of being "unwell".  Don't worry about what it is as much as how you are going to get the cat the help he needs.|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	Take your poor kitty to the vet tomorrow.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	what time is your vet appointment this afternoon?|`|pgfgzz5Jaa	well i know my dog was acting the same way she ended up having kidney failure and had to put her to sleep :( but i say take it to the vet to get him checked out Specially if the cat is on the old side here are some signs of lyme disease    In cats, symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease are:     painful or stiff muscles and joints   fatigue   fever   loss of appetite   possibly sudden collapse
Hhifw93laa	lol yeah the reason why we sont see it know is a number of reasons the first because it takes like 1 week to get white and the other reason is because we feed our animals realy healthy stuf like our dogs are on a diet and a lot of dogs are on medication there is not enough acid in the dogs bowells to alow it to turn white lol well i hope i helped you out on your thoughts lol have a great day God bless|`|gwUMipsUaa	Eventually it will go white if it's not picked up, washed away by rain, etc.|`|4gxpMDsJaa	I would think it would result from feeding bones to the dog, which is not recommended these days. The white resulting from the calcium residue. In earlier times, more people fed leftovers instead of processed dog food.|`|oo2Hqqanaa	White or cream coloured dog poo is often passed by dogs that are fed a BARF diet. The light colour comes from the high percentage of bone in the animals diet.    The other reason is that dogs fed a BARF diet are usually owned by highly responsible owners that ALWAYS clear up after their dogs.|`|csDhZDvraa	Most dog feces will dry out in the heat of the sun. With rain and heat it will before bleach of color after a time, especially if it is on something hard like pavement. If left out  it might also become rock hard and take longer to turn to dirt then non-dried out poo does. lol
AA10229248	We live in a disposable society. When we don't want something anymore, we throw it away and get a new one. Whether it's a VCR or a dog. Look at some of the ads online "Got the dog for the kids but they don't take care of it" or "Got the kids a dog and they want a different breed" that's why they're getting rid of the pet. What does that teach their kids? When you get bored with something or don't want it anymore, throw it away and get a new one.     We also live in a society where everyone wants to keep up with the Joneses so they jump on every fad bandwagon. The neighbor's just spent $800 for a purebred muttadoodle, we better run out and get one too! When reality sets in that you're not in a position to have a dog, you dump it (see above).    People don't do research before they get a specific breed. Let's get a collie because Uncle Bob has a collie. His collie is well behaved, housetrained, and beautifully groomed. Why isn't ours that way? Well they don't come out of a box that way. Uncle Bob is retired and has several hours a day to devote to grooming, training and exercising his dog. You have two jobs, three kids, soccer games, etc. and you threw in the furry four legged equivalent of a toddler into the mix. You didn't have time for it and now it's a matted, hyper, ill-mannered mess. So you dump it (see above)    People refuse to spay/neuter their pets. For any one of a million reasons. Then they give away the offspring to anyone who comes along. Or they dump an entire litter on the shelter because they can't give them away. See above.|`|024lJBZ4aa	What the problem is really depends on where your located.  For instance, in NYC, mostly everyone spays/neuters, so there are very few puppies in the shelters.  Most of the dogs that are there are large dominant breeds (pits, rotts, gsd and mixes of these breeds), usually 6 mos to 2 years and up and untrained.  In fact, it is well known, that some rescue groups in the area regularly import puppies up from down south.    Most common excuses for giving up a dog to the shelter is:  1)  moved to "No Pets" housing  2)  Had a Baby  3)  Housebreaking issues  4)  Something happened to owner (ill, dead, incarcerated)|`|zSOnXtiQaa	irresponsible owners who leave their dogs or give them up because they think the dog has behavior problems when usually its lack of training and time spent with the dog =(|`|224598c2e3c1d07cad06c082f551c456aa	dogs that have run away, people who dont spay/neuter have puppies they dont want, abusive owners etc|`|JBPsePnwaa	Back Yard Breeders and people who but puppies "cause he's sooooooo "cute, and forgot he'll grow up to be a dog and because people don't spay/neuter their pets.|`|6ZuMAvs2aa	I find that a lot of inexperienced owners can find one type of dog to be too much for them. They may be laid-back people, but pick a dog that has too much energy, and so they cannot deal with them and hand them over to the shelters.     Other dogs have issues--food aggression, dog aggression, fence climbers, barkers, separation anxiety.     Some dogs also come from abuse cases, and the vast majority of puppies come from irresponsible owners who did not spay their dog and got a surprise in return, or from backyard breeders who found that nobody wanted to buy those last two or three puppies of theirs.    A lot of dogs are found dumped on the roadside or wandering the streets, and so they're brought into the shelter.    It's a myriad of sources.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	Because people purchase dog and then can not afford them or get tired of them and dump them at the local shelter.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	In my area of central Florida, there are A LOT of foreclosures going on right now. Most of these people have to give up their pets because they can't take them wherever it is that they are going. Not to mention the fact that obviously they can't afford to take care of it. It's a shame really.|`|ZkYxdlTeaa	1) Too many intact males and females needing to be spayed or neutered.    2) Too many irresponsible breeders and pet owners that do not do the above.    3) Not enough homes for all the rescue and shelter dogs that are a product of the above.|`|dgJcxkCGaa	A lot of the reasons that animals are given up by people to the shelters would make most people cringe. All of the examples I give I have actually heard.  Asthma,not housebroken, allergic, chews, doesn't match the furniture, fleas, just don't want any more, no time for, kids pick on it, no money for care, food or medicine too expensive, husband or spouse/other hates it, landlord problems, ugly, got too big, barks too much, digs, not protective, slobbers, bed hog, aggressive, doesn't listen, pulls too much, smells.   Most reasons are related to the people owning them not doing the research before hand or just being lazy. Then there are the other reasons such as got loose, let loose to become stray, injured because of being loose and some are just left at the vets after bill being too high and can't pay. This has happened four times since I've been in animal control.  More of the shelter animals we have now are surrenders because just can't afford them or because they are having trouble finding landlords that will accept the pets since their income has changed.  Plus there are the ones with some of the reasons stated above.|`|CvE881lBaa	irresponsible pet owners and breeders|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Not enough spaying and neutering.  All animals should be spayed or neutered unless they are being purpose-bred by knowledgeable breeders.  No puppy mills, no back yard breeders, no "just once to show the kids the beauty of birth", no breeding for looks only (that means you AKC breeders), just breeding for healthy, happy dogs|`|gwUMipsUaa	Most of them were purchased from pet stores.  Many people make impulse buys, because the puppy is "cute", and are too fat and/or lazy to properly train it and puppy or dog proof the house, and expect a puppy to automatically be potty trained, expect it not to get into anything, and expect it to be able to "hold it" for 8 hours.    In more unusual cases, such as my brother's case, the owner passes away and no one can take the dogs.  That's what we had to do with his dogs...four years ago.  They were adopted out together.    Or the parents buy their kids a puppy and once the newness wears off, the parents are too fat and lazy to MAKE their kids take responsibility, and are too fat and lazy to take over responsibility, so the dog pays the price thanks to lazy, fat slobs.    Edit: Sorry to get so angry, but I'm getting a dog on Saturday from a Rescue, and he's been bounced around several times in his two short years of life, according to the Rescue.    Edit: People who breed just because they have one dog of each gender in the same breed probably won't get the best customers and don't bother with spay/neuter contracts, and don't have return policies, so yes, Back Yard Breeders also play into this, as many of their puppies will ultimately wind up being executed in shelters or pounds.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Mainly ignorant owners. People get dogs and neglect to have them spayed or neutered and then eventually they may get out of the yard and meet a mate and next thing they know there are puppies that they can't afford to care for or that they don't have the time for, so they end up in the shelters. And sadly anymore alot of shelters are NOT taking in stray animals due to the high numbers of crowding in the shelters. Please spay or neuter your pets and ADOPT!!!!!!!!|`|8D3yOlZyaa	Hmm, depends in the city, some dogs in the city may run away and get picked up, or strays have pups, and so on. In the country it's usally cause by over population of animals, in rural areas people have more animals(usually) and mostly dogs, so when these dogs run away ad live in the wild, they have pups and so on.|`|vRG0ebayaa	People who take on more than they can handle....irresponsible ownership, bad pet shops, or horrendous puppy mills... I am actually looking for a shelter dog myself, I believe its nicer to re home one of them rather than bring more dogs in to our world... But I wouldn't say no to a cute puppy mind! I believe in caring for the dogs the very best you can!|`|LHzlvfRQaa	Irresponsible owners.|`|6TXiBrXOaa	abandoned   lost  stolen  people who can no longer care or them  when family's die  anything really  Good luck|`|3giaPYe8aa	Irresponsible breeders selling to irresponsible people & puppy mills.  Of course, some are just strays that are found on the street.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	The real cause of all the dogs in shelters is irresponsible owners.  We can blame puppy mills and backyard breeders all we want, but the real reason dogs end up in the shelter ultimately comes down to people being too lazy to research a pet thoroughly before getting one.  People get a dog because they like the idea of a dog but they don't realize how much work a dog is and when the novelty wears off and reality sets in they dump the dog because it is not convenient and didn't come already trained like Lassie.  When the dog develops behavior problems or simply does what dogs naturally do because they haven't been trained not to the owner either doesn't want to invest in training classes ("too expensive," "not enough time," etc) or they simply don't realize that it is a problem that could be easily fixed with a little basic training so they get rid of the dog so that they no longer have to deal with the problem.  People can't be bothered to spay or neuter for whatever reason but then also can't be bothered to contain their intact animal and they get an "accidental" pregnancy and have no idea how to find homes for all the pups so the unwanted ones end up at the pound.  Or people breed their dog "just once" so that the dog can "experience parenthood" or their kids can "experience the miracle of life" but then don't have homes for the pups so the extras go to the pound.  The puppies that these people do find homes for often go to homes who got them on a whim and weren't prepared for the reality of dog ownership.  Even the "stray" and "run away" dogs are the direct result of irresponsible owners.  Their owners couldn't be bothered to make sure their dogs are safely contained on their own property and once the dogs get loose many can't be bothered to spend the time to go look for them.  Sometimes the dog got loose one too many times and the owner decides it's not worth bailing out of the pound again so they just leave them there.|`|rDLTnjRyaa	These are the reasons why there are so many in the shelters: 1. the family is moving and can't take the dog with them 2. the dog is no longer wanted 3. the dog is a stray 4. the dog got loose and somebody who found the dog took it to the shelter in hopes that it would be claimed 5. the dog is highly aggressive (those ones are usually put to sleep) 6. puppies coming from a unintended breeding 7. puppies coming from intended breeding (from puppy mills, kennels, and back yard breeders). This is the reason why everybody needs to get their animals fixed, socialized, trained, licensed, and micro- chipped. With pure bred dogs, they are only allowed to breed so many times in their life for health reasons. The breeder is completely responsible for every litter the dog has and that includes the vet checks, the vaccines, and finding them homes. I hope that I answered your questions in the way you wanted them answered.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	People who undertake scant/no research before purchasing a puppy are the bread & butter of puppy mills, who produce pups in volume to fill the demand. If the price is high is *must* be well bred is very faulty logic!    When the owner wants to dispose of the dog because "it grew too big" or "didn't train itself" the shelter is left to pick up the pieces.
Pr3QIlweaa	As a long time Great Dane owner and avid traveller, I can tell you that the only way to ship an adult, giant breed dog is via cargo flights (i.e. not in the cargo hold of a commercial flight) (or if you can get an exception made...which is extremely rare...Such as 'Gibson' the tallest dog in the world, who got to ride on a couple of seats in the cabin, next to his owner, to go to the Oprah show).    For every airline I've checked with, over many years travelling with Danes, the tallest crate height I found allowed is 34" (so it's not tall enough for an adult Great Dane).  The maximum weight allowed is 140lbs, including crate.  Since most Danes weigh that or more without the crate, that precludes them from flying on commercial flights.    If by "large" you mean a dog that can fit in a crate that is 34" high and weighs less than 140lbs including the crate, then yes, you can fly a "large" dog on many commercial flights.  But each airline has its own, specific regulations.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Yes.  Check with the airlines and your vet.  I would recommend a professional service that ships animals.  They will know what you need in the way of papers and most of them should be able to provide cages.  Be sure they are registered (IPATA), licensed, and bonded.  You can a find a lot of them just searching "dog shipping". You might also consider driving him or having him driven by someone you trust.  Just make sure they have the necessary papers for him.  Also get him microchipped first, just in case.|`|gwUMipsUaa	You'll have to call the airlines and ask.|`|Bw18seFqaa	yes.. the animal will have to be shipped as cargo by air.. it may cost more than a smaller dog, some airlines charge by weight.. the animal has to be in an airline approved carrier, and also requires a health certificate from the vet.    Check with the airline, there are some guidelines regarding shipping animals as cargo and the weather..  there may be some breed restrictions as well.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	Yes...easiest is Continental. 800-575-3335|`|zL1sggpCaa	Of course you can.... you just have to pay an arm and a leg and probably your hand to do so.    You'll have to get one of the approve crates to ship via an airline and then pay their fees.

YOvTRbC7aa	She may have an ear infection. If your dog is scratching at her ears, rubbing them, holding her head to one side, or down, shaking her head, or if they look bloody or waxy or swollen, they should be checked out by your vet. Also if she cries when her ears are touched, this is another sign of a potential ear infection.  If this seems to be what your dog is experiencing, you need to take your dog to a vet. They will probably prescribe an antibiotic to clear it up.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	You need to see your vet.  This could be an infection -- bacterial or fungal.  Or mites.  Each of these have different treatments so you need to know for sure which it is before you try to treat it.  After you treat her ears and get them cleared up, he can advise you on how to keep them clean.  Go soon, the sooner you treat, the easier it is to clear her ears up.|`|YarHrGijaa	you will have to take her to a vet i think she has ear mites|`|vRG0ebayaa	The vet asap! until then, try to keep her paws off her ears, and try any cream for dogs if you have any.

Good Luck!|`|ClGxicdsaa	shoot her|`|AA12128656	she probably has "little dog syndrome" that's pretty common with rat terriers. and she's going through her trying time. you need to make it really clear that you don't approve of all this barking. have her sit for people who are coming by. if she's good, she gets a cookie and a pet. if she's barky, she gets a correction.    also if she barks at people, have them not pet her. if she's quiet a few minutes, then have them pet her.|`|AA12148328	So she is barking and then being petted by the person she is barking at ? She wants their attention and  has learned that barking gets her petted .  First you have to teach her the silence command . Sit stay and silence , and come   are the basic commands that every dog should be taught .  To teach the silence command , when she is barking , take hold of her muzzle and sharply say silence . When she is quite for a count of 10 , say  alright very happily . If she starts to bark again repeat  the command . When she catches on take your 10 count higher  until she stays quite .  She will learn that barking does not make you happy .|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Common with terriers, I have 2; a Westie and a Cairn. (5 DOGS ALL TOGETHER) Both like to have the last word.  It's the breed.  Sounds like obidience class may help.  It didn't help with my Westie tho -- he was kicked out and referred to private classes!  But you can try it.    Continue to socialize her -- got to the pet store, dog park.  She'll calm down a bit and realize not everyone is the enemy as soon as she's a bit older.  She's going through her terrible teens!|`|riCfCxjEaa	Unfortunately, you're dealing with a teenager with 'tude!  Has she been like this since she was 7 weeks old or was she fine and just lately has been this way?  If it's just lately, she's probable starting to flex her muscle.  Please don't stop taking her out, she needs plenty of exercise but I would take really good, smelly soft treats and when you see someone approaching (you have to see it before she does!) stop, get her attention and feed her small bits of treat as the person or object goes by.  You can also have a friend help you by dropping treats for her as your freind walks past.  She has to start connecting approaching people and pets as good things. It will take some time but keep working, be patient, and good luck!! I hope this helps!  P.S. I wouldn't advise grabbing her muzzle and shouting at her, it just gets her more frustrated and makes her lash out more.  Try the positive reinforcement that I mentioned above, you're dog will thank you!
0HAn67yZaa	socialize her, take her out in public and let people hold her, pet her, ect. just make sure she's around lots of people.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Start with a puppy training class that uses positive reinforcement training.  This will give her confidence to know what to do and how to please you.  It will train you in how to handle her to calm her and give her a feeling of security.  You can ask your vet or check at a Petsmart or ask someone who has a friendly well-behaved dog.

w4DIPHf1aa	did you use silicon to seal the top cap?    only a few things can be going wrong here.    1. the inside of the bottle was contaminated and it killed alot of the yeast.    2.the yeast was poor quality    3. the temperature in your room is cold----this reaction hates a cold room.    4. the recipe is weak and it can't make enough pressure to push threw the air stone (which is a waste) put the end of the hose in a filter intake to pulverise the bubbles.    5. your check valve is messed up. try without it, i've never had to use one.    whats your basic recipe?    fill bottle 2/3 thirds with luke warm water, 2-3 cups of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of yeast and 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda.    a small shake and your good to go.

You big problem is you have to buy a co2 diffuser.  It's basically an upside down cup that holds the co2 under the water and gives it more time to diffuse into the aquarium water.  My final outflow from this went into the intake of the filter though ideally all of the co2 would be absorbed prior to this though that's impossible with a homemade system.  The problem with the homemade systems is they create a lot of co2 at once then the fermentation process slows down.  I didn't have a problem with this though I do strongly suggest you spend some money on the diffuser that goes into the aquarium.  I think mine cost less than $10 and you are way ahead of the game.  I don't think you'll be successful with just an airstone.  1 it takes too much pressure to activate and 2 the bubbles will go straight to the surface and will not diffuse as much as they would if they were slowed down and in contact with the water for a longer period of time.    Enjoy your plant tank, they are my favorite types of aquariums.
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  I have to agree with DeeDawg.  Try giving her a bit of food a little later than you normally do...if she doesn't want it try a treat...something to keep her tummy full.  She vomits about 7am...so hand her a few nibbles of something at 6am before she has a chance to move around too much.  Also, check to see if she is drinking a lot when she first gets up...that can also do it.  If that's the case just limit the water.  A vet check asap if things don't settle in her stomach soon.  Good luck love.|`|YOvTRbC7aa	Could she be pregnant? Morning sickness?|`|s9haCi64aa	It could be BILE. Sometimes when a dogs stomach is empty it will throw up bile.

Is the vomited material yellow?  If so, it may be that it is simply stomach acid.  Dogs produce stomach acid in anticipation of eating, so if no food is forthcoming than they must vomit it up or it will burn their empty stomach.  Try feeding earlier in the morning before it happens and see if that solves the problem.|`|vRG0ebayaa	Morning sicknes?? :\|`|AA12128656	no. your dog's stomach is probably too empty- that's bile more than likely. if it's just a little bit of vomit, give her a little snack before bed, and something when she wakes up. some bland dog cookies are best because they soak up the liquid.  if that doesn't work, take her to the vet right away, could be something else.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Never give a dog milk.  She could be eating grass outside because her stomach is upset, they throw up from that to clean themselves out.  Or she could have hair or something stuck.

0HAn67yZaa	Signs and symptoms     Ear mites are pesky little insects that can infect your dog. They are external parasites and will live on the body and in the ears of canines, although they most frequently infect the ears. The type of ear mite that most commonly affects dogs is classified as otodectes cynotis and is similar to a tiny tick. Dogs who are unfortunately infected by these troublesome insects usually display obvious signs and symptoms. The most common behavior exhibited by canines with ear mites is shaking of the ears and head. Dogs may also scratch at their ears and try to rub them with their paws, on the ground, or against an object. Afflicted animals behave in this way because the ear mites cause severe itching.     However, although shaking and scratching are the most typical warning signs that canines with ear mites display, these parasites can still be present even in a dog that does not show these signs and behaviors. It is believed that this can occur because the intense itching sensation results from a hypersensitivity reaction to the presence of the ear mites. Dogs that do not experience this hypersensitivity reaction will not suffer from the troublesome itching symptoms that other dogs do. Yet, it does seem that the majority of infected canines do indeed suffer from severe itching and thus will shake and scratch at their head and ears.     If you are concerned that your pet might be suffering from dog ear mites, there are other signs and symptoms to look for as well. Dogs suffering from this affliction may also have scratches and sores in and around their ears. Also, an infection by ear mites often produces a dark discharge from the afflicted pet's ears. Sometimes compared to coffee grounds in appearance, this discharge consists of earwax, blood, biochemicals, and the actual ear mites. Often, this discharge will develop an odor. A dog's continued scratching at its ears can lead to secondary infections which then cause an unpleasant smell that accompanies the dark excretions from the ears. If your pet is displaying one or more of these signs and symptoms, dog ear mites may be the cause.             Diagnosis     Dog ear mites are relatively easy for a veterinarian to diagnose. However, it's very important to you do not try to diagnose and treat this condition yourself. The symptoms commonly caused by ear mites, including discomfort and discharge, can also be caused by other types of ear infections. Trying to treat your pet's ear infection with the wrong kind of medication will not only prolong your dog's discomfort, it can actually make things worse. Therefore, if you believe that your dog might be suffering from an ear infection of some type or another, be sure to take your pet to a veterinarian as soon as possible.     In order to make a diagnosis of ear mites, a veterinarian will examine a sample of the dark discharge of earwax and blood to check for the presence of mites and eggs. This is quite simple to do and often only requires the use of a lighted otoscope. The light from this tool attracts the mites, which will then emerge from the wax and move around. The otoscope itself magnifies the insects and makes them easier to see. If mites are not visible with the use of a lighted otoscope, an examination can then be carried out under a microscope. A low-power magnification will reveal any mites that are present.     Pathophysiology If your pet is suffering from dog ear mites, it may help to have a basic understanding of these insects and how they cause problems for your canine companion. As mentioned previously, ear mites are a type of external parasite, sometimes described as tiny crab-like or spider-like critters. While most easily observed with the use of a microscope, these insects can sometimes be seen with the naked eye. Usually, they appear as a tiny white dot against the darker earwax. Otodectes cynotis, the type of ear mite that most commonly affects dogs, has eight legs and lives on the surface of the skin in canine ear canals. Here, the mites feed upon debris and tissue fluids, and can cause severe inflammation and discomfort.     The eggs of these insects require approximately four days of incubation, after which time they will hatch and release a larva. The larval stage lasts four about one week and during this time it feeds upon earwax and oils produced by the skin. The next stage of life for an ear mite involves molting into a protonymph. After that, the protonymph then molts into a deutonymph. Although at this point in its life the ear mite has not yet developed a gender, it mates with an adult male and then goes on to develop into either an adult male or adult female. If the deutonymph turns into an adult female, it will then lay eggs. The lifespan of an adult ear mite lasts for around two months. As with mites in the larval stage, adult ear mites also feed upon earwax and oils. These mites will generally spend their entire lifespan on the body of the infected dog. However, sin|`|FT9Krq8xaa	Yes of course. A dog can get mites at any season. More likely he has  an ear infection. Dogs will scratch at an ear if it feels sore.

yOwRD4ZEaa	She's obviously freaked out by your cat. Keep the new kitten in it's own room with a litter box, food and water for at least a few days until she settles into her new environment. After that, introduce them gradually for a few minutes at at time.. try to distract them both with treats, toys, or wet food. If either of them become agitated, separate them immediately and try again later. The point is for them to spend increasing amounts of time together with only positive stimulus. They should associate being in the same room together with having fun.     Let them go at their own pace and they'll be fine together.|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	Wow I'm going threw the same at the moment.

Our rescue often gets very nice dogs that are owner turns ins, no fault of the dog's, the owner goes into a nursing home, assisted living, some die, some move and can't take the pup, dogs are found by Animal Services, some get nervous around kids and get dumped when the people have little ones, all sorts of reasons - most are no reflection on the dog and very few are from puppy mills.|`|qES5f0tqaa	Go With what you think if you like the looks and how this dog look to you. good luck choosing this one is a cute one remember try it out if it notwork out there you go at least try|`|UgVuQJriaa	I think that Sammy and Peggy would both be great companions!

ZNDqYUwkaa	Ok....some good answers on here from walking lady and melissa K.    Shows like the dog whisperer are great for showing that behavior problems can be resolved, but I would not advise anyone to try and do this themselves as understanding canine psychology and behavior is a very complex thing. I have studied dogs and wolves, domesticated and wild, neutered and intact and can quite defiantly say that dogs have their very own method of communication which is similar to, but not the same as that of wolves.     Dominance is highly over diagnosed by people who don't understand or know how to interpret a dogs body language. From what you have described above, I would say that your dog lacks trust in anyone but you because you provide for it, give it boundaries and give it consistency.    Your husband and sons need to stop giving the corrections until the dog has gained trust with them. By saying NO to her at the moment, they are effectively barking at her. Barking at a fearful dog will never end happily.    You should correct the behavior as you already do, this is working for you, so no point changing it and causing stress. When one dog feels that another may be threatening, nervous, over excited or aggressive, they will turn their head away, sometimes yawn or lick their lips. These are all calming signs that dogs give each other to say that they mean no harm.    I would suggest that when you give a correction, your husband and sons look away from the dog and do the same at any time that the dog is showing signs of fear, anxiety or aggression to allow the dog to build trust in them that they will not do anything to harm her.    This technique is one that will not create any tension or stress that can result in a bite.     As for helping that trust and eventually respect and leadership for your husband and sons, have a behavior therapist or very good trainer come to your home to work with them and you on setting up a routine and giving you all exercises to establish a consistent environment and leadership for her.    Like I said, if you try any other form of correction or try to rehabilitate your dog yourself, you may diagnose the cause of the aggression inaccurately and cause more problems and stress for you all and the dog.    Good luck and you can get a referral for a behavior specialist through your vet.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It's really hard to try to answer these questions without actually seeing what's going on and watching the interactions and the dog's body language, but I'd bet that this dog's not "alpha" at all, she's afraid.  She's defending herself because she's afraid.      In any case, what you really should be doing is getting some help here because dogs who are afraid will bite if they feel they have to.  A good behaviourist if you can, or else obedience classes but with a very qualified instructor who really understands dogs, no Petsmart classes.  And I think your husband should be the one to take her to classes, or at the very least do the "homework" with her.|`|vRG0ebayaa	Studies have shown that female dogs try to dominate the family because in the wild, back the their roots, females normally tend to try to rule the pack. They also have a tendency to stick to human males more because they know that with a human female, they might not get the dominance they want. Try obedience lessons and training and go one step at a time, and good for you getting a shelter dog!    Good look with her!|`|j2albguDaa	if she's always acted that way toward them, then it could be that a male beat her before.  watch the dog whisperer on some tips.  you can also go to his website for tips.  you'd be amazed at what he can do.|`|AA12128656	it's probably not an abuse issue, it sounds more like dominance to them because they are not reinforcing it.  you should have them do more in her daily feeding, walking, etc., if you are her primary care. she needs to have to depend on them for things, so that she will have to respect them.  she should wear a dominant dog collar. when she obeys the reprimand, she should be rewarded by the guys.   when she disobeys the reprimand, she should be corrected.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Walking Lady, I give you a big kiss on the forehead!    I agree that your dog is probably not an Alpha (Alphas understand when there is a real threat and when there isn't and they don't need to resort to this much growling and such to get their point across) dog and this is fear-based not dominance-based. You need to hire a private trainer or behaviorist asap to help with this.|`|ZmFa6FL2aa	Put the dominance idea aside and ask yourself could your dog be feeling frightened by the behavior of your husband or son? It doesn't matter whether she was abused in the past or not, lots of dogs are not comfortable being 'threatened' by men. Instead of reprimanding her when she does something bad, why not train her to do what you want. Dogs repeat behaviors they get rewarded for and get better at behaviors they repeat.    www.fearfuldogs.com|`|FewhKlx9aa	In this case you are the Alpha to her as she listens to just you..What you are describing is'nt good as the dog should'nt show teeth to anyone in the family and this could be dangerous.How long have you had her?? You can be correct that the reason she acts this way toward males is because she was abused by them in the past.I would think that your husband and son need to take the dog for obediance training so hopefully she will learn to listen to them also..But this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen

dKKgwzGraa	An aggressive molly is actually rare, because they are community fish and typically get along very well with each other. It all depends on their personality. A male molly will dominate the other females, and two will always tussle over females. If there are no males present, however, one of the females will come to dominance. The fights are usually quick and harmless, but once my females did get in a bad fight and one's dorsal fin was ripped.    I will agree, though - it's not uncommon to get a boring platy.    I'd suggest one white female molly, a cory cat, and a honey sunset gourami. This particular species is community and easy to care for.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	If you've had good luck with the platy's I'd go for them again.  They cn range from rare pinks and blues to the more popular reds and oranges.  Just make sure you get either all males or you'll have fry.  If you want fry, get two females and one male so the females aren't harassed.  They fish you mentioned, did you have them together?    One dalmation, one platy and a guppy in a ten gallon?  Mollies not kept in groups can become aggressive.  When kept in a community they are much calmer.  You could try one male for two females, or even three females as they will be far less aggressive than a male.  Guppies should be kept in groups as well, if the one tux guppy was with an aggressive molly his hiding was normal.  A tank of guppies should be very entertaining.  With livebearers, females can delay the development of their embryos, making them capable of having fry months after being sseparated from a male.  The females are far less likely to fight than the males though.  Best of Luck!|`|AA11708471	Tank stocking should not be judged on number of fish you could easily have six white cloud mountain minnows in that tank bout you could only have about 3 mollies its all to do with waste output and the size of the fish    anyway how about  A dwarf gourami  A swordtail  and  a flying fox fish|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I like the neon guppies or whatever with the bright backbone.

They are a fast fish and very hardy and look good and are very inexpensive. it is cool to see them chase each other around. They are easy to care(hardy) for(10 year old) and very enjoyable to watch. you could do 2 cory doras too. I hope this helps|`|ScHbqXKNaa	Corydoras are really nice, but they'll be shy unless you get 2 or three of them.    If you go for that, I'd recommend a Dwarf Gourami of any variety.  They're really pretty and hardy.    You could also have a swordtail fish, but it's been my personal experience that they like to jump out of the tank.    Alternatively, danios are really small fish and love to swim in a school.  I know you only want three fish, but you could get six of these and watch them swim around together.  They're fairly easy to care for, come in many varieties (that will school together), and if you get the right light for your aquarium, some are iridescent.    All of the above fish get along well together, so you could certainly get one of each.|`|IxP2IMbcaa	I used to have platys. It was so funny because it seemed they were always making babies. The only thing that would bother me is when we weren't able to separate them in time. Usually some would end up eaten, sometimes as we were trying to separate them. God it used to just freak me out. Other than that, they were fun.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Why only 3 fish?    If I could get the tank mature enough, either high-spec planted shrimp tank OR a group of 5-7 male endlers and 4-5 dwarf Corydoras (very difficult little beggers to keep alive!)    http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/10_Gallon|`|AA11510999	how about 2 goldfish and a sucker fish? They all three live a very long time and a sucker fish will help keep the tank clean|`|7bbfUYUOaa	Male guppies, male swordtails, and cardinal tetras.    I would personally do 6 cardinal tetras and then 3-4 male guppies, but that is only two fish lol.
hbj6vGE4aa	It's just a pup.  It doesn't need exercise, at this point just playing with you is going to be adequate.    When your dog gets older, then you can go for walks to exercise.  Make sure you get your pup into a puppy class!  It will need the socialization.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	A 9 week old puppy isnt fully immunized yet. Until it reaches 6 months I would limit walks to areas where there arent a lot of other dogs. Not including potty breaks at 6 months of age I would think 2 times a day, 30 minute walks would do, 1 hour each time if the pup is enjoying it.|`|vRG0ebayaa	30mins twice daily? maybe a little longer at the weekends?|`|FnrAw2SQaa	It doesn't matter but as long as you take him a walk and play with him every day you"ll be fine just don't over do it and give him plenty of water.|`|zL1sggpCaa	How much do you need? :-)    Each dog is different, but I would go with a nice 30 minute walk. You want to keep the puppy healthy inside and out... So, I would start on short walks and work your way up to a nice walk. Or, a 30 minute slower walk.|`|47c4ff6e9c297fdfff7f161925a3e19eaa	Since it's a puppy at minimum, 3 to 4 times a day, and about 20-30 minutes of play time and fun
0OTuWHhpaa	It depends on the breed of dwarf hamster (there's more than one).  Pets at Home has leaflets about hamsters which give you a quick brief on behavoir.|`|jb59SazLaa	i've had all types of hamsters, and dwarfs are definitely my favorite. i've also had all types of rodents, mice, guinea pigs, rats, and i love rats the most. but if you really want a hamster its a good choice if you just want one, because for rats you really need 2.
Ob9AZnA4aa	Seeing as puppies usually stop nursing after 7 to 8 weeks this seems to be pushing it a bit. It would've been better to get the puppy after 10 weeks since many puppies like to continue nursing, until it's mother doesn't allow it anymore. Since it is a puppy though, the human interaction this young should be great for it's social health with children and older people. The puppy shouldn't have been given away this early though... it's illegal before 8 weeks old.     I would probably mention it to whomever seems the most mature. Obviously they didn't think too much through though having another dog that is not good with other dogs.|`|FnrAw2SQaa	She is too young there suppose to leave when there about 4 months old to get knowledge from there mother and so on!  But then again i got a 2 month old rottie from a friend only cuz the (mom dog had died(hit by a car))my pup is doing just fine.You got to start training right away though letting the dog know whos the boss etc.I do go against back yard breeders though they know nothing of the dogs breed there only in for the profit.I strongly fill you should go to the "breeder" and get your money back.Or report him!  It isnt right its illegal to breed them enyway!|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Argggghhh....six weeks is too young.  Have them take the pup to the vet and see what the vet has to say.    Cockers are not the best pet to get when you have small children.  Those long ears, kids just want to tug and the breed is prone to ear infections.    At least your cousin has you around to keep an eye/ear open.  I don't see this turning out well for your cousin and surely not for the pup.  Too bad your cousin didn't do a bit more reasearch before becoming a pet owner.|`|zL1sggpCaa	I got my Rat Terrier at 6 weeks.... And I haven't had any problems with her in over 3 years....    Its all about the owner and how she handles/treats the new puppy. If the puppy is taken care of - there shouldn't be any problems.    Has the pup had her shots? Will it eat on its own?    And, as far as the looks go... your husband's cousin should know about what the looks will be based upon the way the parents look.|`|j2albguDaa	as long as the dog has stopped nursing, it's not too young to be away from the mom.  and if she's raising the dog around her children where they play with her everyday, she will be fine.  have her take it to the vet to get a check up and first round of shots and as long as she keeps the dog healthy, then she'll be fine.  and cocker puppies don't really look like cockers that much until they get a little older.  i think you need to stay out of her business.|`|AGZFvag4aa	yes  byb is  very  bad because  they  dont  know  anything  about  breeding  or  dogs  conditions.  research  a  dog  club  in the  area   let  them  know  and  ask  questions  what  to  do. a  puppy  shouldn't   be  released until at least 11 weeks  just  to  be  safe|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	Very simple. Be extremely worried. Say something. Mention to them about doing research on breeds, healthy pups and signs to watch for. This would of helped to know before hand. They have 3 choices. Get the pup medical care, return the pup, or give it to the humane society. The breeder should be reported no questions at all about that one. I hope they get it medical care and sue the pants off the breeder for all of the expenses. So sorry hope they are open to hearing it all.|`|2i3d5pcAaa	She needs to get her for a checkup asap.  After that, the vet should determine her true age, what she needs (some still need formula w/ their food).|`|AA10873763	6 weeks is not WAY too young.  7 weeks is optimum, 6 used to be the norm.

And a puppy of six weeks should be on a puppy food, not formula.  We actually start our puppies (we breed chocolate labs) at around four weeks, they can nurse from mom when they want, or when she want to feed them.  But there is food for them when they choose to eat, is up to them.  Our vet will usually release our puppies around seven weeks, but six is not unheard of.|`|knvSmMB0aa	Hi there :)    I'm not too concerned, as many breeders sell the puppies as early as 6 weeks, as long as they're eating on their own.  I've been raised in a kennel, and my mom always taught me that as long as they've been separated from their momma and are eating on their own, and they don't need any assistance, they can leave at six weeks.    My mom raised cockers for about 30 years, so I know a good bit about them as well.  The puppy should REALLY be looking like SOME sort of spaniel by now.  You know, with the stalky bodies, fluffy ears and legs, and the easily identifiable cocker face.  The quality may be a factor, but since your husband's cousin bought the puppy already, they obviously found it "cute" in SOME way.... and yes, have them take it to a vet, in case there might be some problem with it, then they might be able to take it back.    Autumn|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	you could say that you think the puppy is too young to be away from the mother and nicely suggest that they take it back to the breeder for 3 weeks
80S8U7Edaa	Your lucky nothing has happened to your other dog. I've heard that too, that it's good for their coat... but it's really dangerous! As the other person said, they could get salmonella and possibly die. I definitely wouldn't risk it.     If you want a nice coat, make sure to brush it frequently and use a great shampoo & conditioner:  http://www.gingerpuplane.com/shop-dog-gr...|`|YarHrGijaa	yes u can but not 2 much|`|FnrAw2SQaa	You can but not to much of it.... it might give him a tommy ache.|`|p7swtBYzaa	There's some danger of salmanella in raw eggs, no matter who eats them, probably not that much - but I wouldn't take a chance.    Why do you need to give raw egg to your dog anyway?   Feed a good dry kibble with meat as the first ingredient (Canidae is very good) and add some cooked, white meat, skinless, boneless chicken or lean chop meat if you want to add protein.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes but no more than 1 or two a week depending on how he tolerates the egg. It may loosen his stool up the first few times he's had it until he adjusts.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Raw eggs are fine and make vitamins and especially Biotin bind to the nutritional value of their food..|`|47c4ff6e9c297fdfff7f161925a3e19eaa	I wouldn't give your puppy raw food yet, once he's a little older, around 10-11 months; it should be no problem!
TZT0SCZSaa	Take her to the vet NOW!  Unexplained weight loss  and loss of appetite should always be checked out as soon as possible.  It could be something simple, but it will only get worse if you don't get it treated.

Please get your dear dog to the vet right away.|`|dPVJKn0Zaa	absolutely bring her to the vet asap.  boxers are prone to many serious health problems, many of which can be treated successfully by your vet if caught quickly.  please don't let her suffer - she may be in pain, and it's not humane to let any dog, let alone one who has been your loyal companion for 7 years- suffer when you can help her.|`|EdylM2Y3aa	a little overweight?? girl please please! get her to a vet! JUST TODAY, i had to put down my 8 yr old jack russell. the guilt i'm suffering through is nothing compared to what I put her through. she was an outside dog so catching this was hard. I got her vaccinated and rabies in october and the vet didnt ask if I had her on heart worm treatment and i never thought about asking! this whole time we thought she was pregnant BUT what was happening was her belly swelling and she was to anemic! there was nothing they could do so we put her down. my heart is breaking, right now my four children cry at sporadic moments.we are numb and what i keep hating myself for is that THIS ALL COULD'VE BEEN PREVENTED! if we had just had her checked. i killed my furbaby. burying her with all her toys in my son's favorite jacket is the most excruciating thing we've been through. please do take her to the vet.
DoEUlpadaa	cocsidiosus (spelling ?).  Is blood in the stools too??  A vet can determine from a stool sample.  If that is what it is they will give a supplement to add to the water.|`|7es9ODLLaa	You've got to get the calf to a vet ASAP, it sounds like it could have a serious or deadly virous.  It could be far worse though....    Check and see if your area has a SPCA and will defer the cost of the visit.  Or call your local vet and explain your situation and maybe they can make a house call.  Most rural areas have a vet that does that.    Good luck!
iVQULHqYaa	What a brilliant idea. Please tell me what inkc means. Crossed puppies  and pedigree puppies  have a wonderful time at "rescue centers" until they are PTS. after two weeks.     You will have no control over the puppies that your dogs sires. You will never know about the homes that they are going to or how many puppies that their puppies will produce.     What the hell, thousands of dogs are PTS every day, why should you worry. There are people who spend their lives trying to rehome and save puppies and older dogs who are abused and then dumped. Do you want to add to the pile of dead dogs that are PTS every day.|`|YarHrGijaa	my dog culd cross with yours if it wants.|`|gwUMipsUaa	And the trolls march on.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Click the report button, ya'll.

Los murcilagos (del latn mus, muris -ratn- y caeculus - diminutivo de "ciego") son mamferos cuyas extremidades superiores se desarrollaron como alas. Mientras que otros mamferos como la ardilla voladora slo planean distancias limitadas, los murcilagos son los nicos mamferos realmente capaces de volar.    Los murcilagos pertenecen al orden de los quirpteros o Chiroptera (del griego ?, cheiros -mano- y , pteron -ala-), puede ser traducido como "mano-alada". La estructura del ala abierta es muy similar a la de una mano humana abierta y cubierta por una membrana.    Contrariamente a las creencias populares, no se los considera ciegos, ya que muchos, adems de su sistema de sonar, emplean la vista para diferentes actividades.    Un murcilago recin nacido puede colgar de la madre y ser transportado, aunque pronto se vuelven muy grandes para esto. Los animales forman con frecuencia nidos para la cra, con muchas hembras dando a luz en la misma rea, que puede ser una cueva, un hueco en un rbol, o una cavidad en un edificio. Dos glndulas mamarias (mamas) se encuentran situadas en el pecho y en los hombros. Slo la madre se preocupa por los jvenes.    La habilidad para volar es congnita, pero al nacer las alas son muy peque?as para lograrlo. Los jvenes (los peque?os insectvoros) se independizan a las 6 u 8 semanas, mientras que los grandes no lo hacen antes de haber cumplido cuatro meses. Son sexualmente maduros a los dos a?os.    La mayora de los murcilagos son frigivoros o se alimentan de peque?os insectos, solo unas cuantas especies americanas son hematfagas, es decir que se alimentan de sangre, los ataques de murcielagos a humanos son algo raros, sin embargo si se han reportado. Una mordida de murcielago por si misma resulta poco da?ina sin embargo pueden transmitir enfermedades y parasitos en su saliva, que de no ser detectados pueden causar da?os importantes.

En cuanto es colocado en uno, el murcilago hace descender la temperatura de su cuerpo y se echa a dormir, los latidos de su corazn disminuyen de 180 a 3 por minuto y sus movimientos respiratorios pasan de 8 por segundo en actividad a 8 por minuto en reposo.    Si han acumulado suficiente grasa, como generalmente hacen desde principios de oto?o al comenzar a prepararse para la hibernacin, puede sobrevivir durante muchos meses a temperaturas fras, sin necesidad de alimentarse durante ese periodo.      [editar] Longevidad  Si bien la longevidad de los mamferos suele guardar relacin con el tama?o del animal (el ratn de campo en 1 a?o muere, el perro envejece a los 12 a?os, el caballo envejece a los 17), el murcilago presenta una excepcin a esta regla y, pese a ser de menor tama?o que el ratn vive 15 a?os o ms.      [editar] Vuelo y ecolocalizacin  El vuelo verdadero en los vertebrados vivos est limitado a los murcilagos y a las aves; sin embargo, a diferencia de muchas aves, los murcilagos pueden volar a velocidades relativamente lentas con gran maniobrabilidad. El ala del murcilago es una membrana delgada denominada patagio que est sostenida por el alargamiento de los huesos de la extremidad anterior, en concreto por el antebrazo y el segundo dedo, en su borde delantero, y por los dedos tercero, cuarto y quinto, en su borde trasero. La unin del patagio con el cuerpo se realiza a lo largo de la lnea media del tronco y en varias especies se extiende entre ambas extremidades posteriores y la cola. El dedo primero o dedo pulgar de la extremidad anterior es el nico que est libre y, al igual que los dedos de los pies, tiene u?a.    Todos los micromurcilagos poseen un mecanismo que les permite volar y, en el caso de las especies insectvoras, tambin les permite localizar a sus presas sin necesidad de usar el sentido de la vista o del olfato: es la ecolocalizacin. sta consiste en la emisin de sonidos de alta frecuencia (ultrasonidos), que despus de chocar con los objetos, se reflejan a modo de eco y son captados por las orejas del murcilago. Al igual que el sonar, este sistema los capacita para conocer la posicin, la distancia relativa e incluso el tipo de objetos que hay a su alrededor. El murcilago, de esta manera, puede volar en total oscuridad, y podra afirmarse que es capaz de ver acsticamente. Las se?ales emitidas tienen una frecuencia y una modulacin caractersticas en cada especie. Los pulsos de sonido son generados en la laringe del animal y, segn la especie, son emitidos por la boca o por los orificios nasales.    A diferencia de los micromurcilagos, los megamurcilagos emplean la visin para orientarse y localizar a sus presas (un nico gnero ha desarrollado un mecanismo de ecolocacin que utiliza slo cuando vuela en total oscuridad). Los ojos de los megamurcilagos estn ms desarrollados que los de los micromurcilagos y, en general, ningn murcilago est completamente ciego; incluso los micromurcilagos pueden utilizar como se?ales durante el vuelo objetos muy visibles del terreno para regresar a su refugio.

RmNtCAxpaa	She's wanting you to spay her considering odds are that only 1 out of 4 of those kittens will find a forever home. The others will be given away or put in a shelter where 71% of the cats and kittens that go there are killed. Think about it. Is it really worth it not to spay her? Spaying and neutering also has many health benefits. It can prevent mammary(breast) cancer and tumors. It eliminates the risk of unterine cancer and uterine infections and it eliminates the risk of ovarian cancer. Cats who remain unaltered live on average half the life span of spayed and neutered cats. Please get your kitty spayed. If the cost is the problem then you can find a low cost spay and neuter clinic. Go to http://www.spotusa.org/ to find a clinic near you and to educate yourself on pet overpopulation and it's effects.     You're cat is probably meowing to say that she is weaning her cats. You need to start giving them access to cat food wet or dry, water and a litter box. You need to prepare them for leaving the nest which should happen at preferably 12 weeks old. If you're already giving them all this then she's probably just telling them that they're being weaned and she's refusing them milk to make them eat the cat food.    Please spay your kitty and give the kittens to homes where they will be spayed or neutered at no later than 6 months of age, preferably 4 months for female cats, before they go into their first heat.     P.S. In the future, try to keep your posts to one at a time.|`|GHo805Adaa	you know its not nice to post the exact same questions 3 times in a row..|`|7f8ab26d3f500f4da901928824fe9dbcaa	If you are not feeding the babies canned food yet, you should start.

hdojXU1eaa	Where are you located? We can't guess what type of snakes they might have been if we don't know where they were found.    Also, what kind of well are we talking about? An old-fashioned wishing-well type, or a well house that covers a well pump? I don't think any species of snake specifically lives in wells, but depending on when the snakes were seen, they may have been hibernating in the well and fled when disturbed. They also may have been using the well to escape the midday heat. Your question is a little vague at the moment, so it's hard to tell.    However, if you are in the US, they were probably not venemous--none of the venemous snakes native to the US are orange.|`|AA10460778	Almost any type of snake can live in a well.

k5ygB963aa	Voc recebeu como respostas um monte de contradi??es o0  Vamos falar sobre o padr?o da ra?a, e n?o sobre exemplares isolados.    S?o c?es de alerta, latem se ouvirem algo estranho e pra avisarem da chegada de visitas.  N?o s?o brincalh?es. S?o c?es reservados, gostam de ter seu tempo e seu espa?o, n?o gostam de brincadeiras rudes, ou seja, se a crian?a n?o tiver jeito com ele, ele se distanciar dela, e pode at dar um 'oi' mas n?o vai participar realmente das brincadeiras por mais tempo. Escolhem um nico dono e a este d?o privilgios -fazem festa, aceitam colo, etc....com o restante das pessoas ele selecionar suas amizades - ele sabe de quem ele gosta, n?o vai tratar todo mundo igual. N?o  agressivo, mas n?o gosta de se sentir desrespeitado. N?o vai pedir por passeios e brincadeiras, pode ficar horas sozinho sem destruir a casa -c?o independente- mas isso n?o significa que goste de ficar hooooras a fio sozinho, sem aten??o. N?o  ciumento e nem possessivo.      Deve saber que uma crian?a de 5 anos n?o ter responsabilidade sobre o c?o, que voc n?o deve de pegar um animal apenas por causa dele, e sim, ter a conscincia de que  voc que ter que cuidar literalmente dele por volta de uns 15 anos e supervisionar as brincadeiras dos 2, visto que c?es pequenos s?o frgeis e que crian?as 'enjoam'.    Sinceramente, quando se trata de fazer companhia a uma crian?a, ainda mais uma t?o nova, e que seja para brincadeiras, recomendo um Shih-Tzu, parente prximo do Lhasa, porm bem mais brincalh?o e paciente, s?o os c?es mais recomendados para fazer companhia a crian?as e a outros animais. Um Yorkshire tambm  bem animado, porm  super ativo e pode n?o se dar bem com crian?as tambm, j o Shih-Tzu brinca quando  pra brincar e fica quieto quando  pra ficar, escolhem um nico dono, mas s?o muito sutis ao demonstrarem isso, visto que n?o gostam de causar 'constrangimentos', tratam todos iguais, e gostam de fazer festas at para estranhos, n?o costumam latir e nem rosnar, porm a minha desenvolveu o hbito de me alertar sobre chegadas e acontecimentos estranhos, mas demorou at que eu ouvisse algum barulho da parte dela o0,  chamada de 'sombra' e 'simpatia', j que me segue pra cima e pra baixo mas trata bem as outras pessoas, tambm s?o c?es que podem ficar sozinhos, mais tempo do que os outros, e menos do que o Lhasa, sem maiores problemas. Como dito, est?o sempre prontos para brincadeiras e passeios, o que n?o significa serem ativos, alis, eles topam tudo, porm n?o aguentam muita carga de atividade sem alguns descan?os, o que significa que algumas brincadeiras e corridinhas em torno dos mveis da casa ser?o o suficiente para suprir suas necessidades fsicas, visto ser braquiceflico(nariz achatado). S?o conhecidos como 'peludos bons de colo', por adorarem carinhos e aceitarem bem um colo, sem se debatarem, inclusive no meio da rua, ao contrrio de outras ra?as, que ficam 'doidas' para descerem ou no meio de outras pessoas.    Ambos Lhasa quanto Shih-Tzu n?o tm o costume de roer e morder os mveis da casa! Pelo contrrio, s?o bem educados, a n?o ser quando filhotes, devido ao nascimento dos dentinhos, podem tentar alguma travessura, dae  educar e dar brinquedos para morderem. Fora isso, eles s ir?o 'destruir' algo se se sentirem muito ansiosos -sem aten??o dos donos, e olhe l.  Ambos tambm n?o s?o c?es para viverem do lado de fora da casa, o Shih-Tzu principalmente, que  c?o de companhia por excelncia.     Quanto a quest?o da inteligncia,  o que foi dito, est?o numa posi??o ruim, mas o que acontece : eles aprendem rpido as coisas do dia-a-dia, quanto a comandos do tipo senta, deita, essas coisas precisam de mais repeti??es do que outros c?es para aprenderem, porm, s?o do tipo que quando acharem mais interessante se fingirem de surdos, ir?o fazer -obedincia-  mas no geral adoram agradar seus donos.

Carinhosos sim , mas n?o brincalh?es t!|`|WM7ds0jQaa	 um c?o muito bom para quem tem crian?as em casa.    Amorosos: eles tem um cora??o muito grande, sabem amar e retribuir todo o carinho que recebem.      Alerta: A qualquer sinal de perigo eles latem para avisar ao dono. Se houver uma pessoa na frente da sua porta ele ir latir para avisar aos donos da chegada do estranho.       Companheiro: Sempre est ao seu lado. O lhasa escolhe um dono. A este dono ele nunca abandona. Onde est minha esposa dentro de casa, l est?o os lhasas. Podem at estar dormindo, mas se levantam para acompanhar minha esposa em cada c?modo da casa.      Inteligente: embora o Lhasa Apso esteja em uma classifica??o bem ruim no ranking de inteligncia, eu considero uma ra?a muito inteligente, porm temperamental. Deixe-me explicar. O ranking da de inteligncia valoriza os c?es que aprendem mais rpido truques e comandos. O Lhasa Apso tem uma caracterstica de ser temperamental. Ou seja, ele somente aprende aquilo que ele quer... entretanto, ele APRENDER TUDO para agradar seu dono e muito rpido. Ele fica extremamente magoado quando percebe que deixou seu dono triste. OU seja, na minha opini?o, alm de inteligente, ele  extremamente emotivo.     Veja o padr?o da ra?a neste site abaixo:    http://paginas.terra.com.br/servicos/exc...

bFByfFNHaa	Bonjour,   Il faut rencontrer plusieurs chats et te fier  ton instinct...  Va voir les refuges de ta rgion ou renseigne-toi dans ton entourage si quelqu'un  un jeune chat  confier.  Perso, je me suis adresse  une collgue qui a recueilli plusieurs chats...  Elle m'a montr des photos et j'ai craqu pour un petit noir de 6 ou 8 mois.  On a t prsents, il s'est laiss caresser, il tait trs timide...  Bref, je l'ai ramen chez moi, il y a 3 mois...  Depuis, il a pris ses marques, il me suit partout et n'a jamais assez de calins...  Son caractre s'est affirm, mais, ?a me plait !  C'est lui, l :  http://img165.imageshack.us/my.php?image...|`|6xck1hbZaa	Il n'y a pas de critres qui  permettent de savoir si un chat sera affectueux ou pas. ?a viendra de l'ducation que tu vas lui donner. prend un chaton, n'importe lequel, habitues le avec toi, prend le dans tes bras, si tu veux viter les dsagrments (pour un chat comme pour une chatte) fait le oprer il n'aura pas envie de sortir. si tu as une voiture : habite le tout petit dans la voiture.  et surtout aime le.|`|db392f14b9d9198f7a521d229fb93fb7aa	Un chat est un tre vivant, il n'est pas programmable ce n'est pas un produit, tu ne peu pas exiger qu'il soit tel que tu le veux...    Ta demande n'est pas mchante en sois mais tu as le profil parfait d'une personne qui serait ravie d'avoir un animal gntiquement modifi pour correspondre exactement  ton besoin et cela m'inquite cette fa?on de penser, c'est  cause de cela que l'ont pourrait voir beaucoup de drives...

Plus pot de colle que lui, tu meurs. Le seul petit ennui, ce sont les miaulements intempestifs. Mais bon, on ne peut pas tout avoir. Bonne journe.|`|NbcrR9xnaa	Quand tu choisis un chaton, regarde bien comment il se comporte avec les humains. S'il vient vers toi, l'air intress, la queue dresse (c'est un signe de bienvenue, d'amiti), c'est dj un trs bon point.  Sauf si c'est un chaton abandonn, il faut qu'il soit laiss  sa mre jusqu' ses trois mois, pas moins. C'est avec sa mre et ses frres et soeurs qu'il se sociabilise, qu'il est duqu, qu'il construit son futur quilibre de chat adulte. S'il est spar plus t?t par des circonstances involontaires, il faudra jouer le r?le de sa mre, le laisser dormir sur l'oreiller, te ronronner dessus  longtemps de soire, le laisser seul le moins possible, et aussi l'duquer (je ne parle pas du sable  chat, en gnral mme des chatons trs jeunes comprennent tout de suite  quoi ?a sert). L'duquer, c'est, par exemple, lui apprendre  ne pas griffer trop fort en jouant (il teste, il joue les chefs, il faut lui faire comprendre avec gentillesse et fermet qu'on n'est pas d'accord pour servir de griffoir !) mais aussi ne pas neutraliser ses instincts. S'il sort et ramne des mulots, c'est triste pour le mulot, mais c'est la loi de la Nature ! En appartement, il s'occupera avec les mouches !  Pour ce qui est du c?t calin, la plupart des chats qui ne sortent pas sont calins et trs proches de nous. Ceux qui sortent peuvent devenir un peu plus distants, avec des moments de calins moins frquents...  Je pense qu'un chat quilibr,  qui l'on montre de l'attention et de l'affection, que l'on ne stresse pas, que l'on ne tripote pas non plus  tout instant sans tenir compte de ses envies  lui, bref, dans ces conditions l un chat est toujours assez calin pour satisfaire nos besoins de tendresse avec lui...  Rien ne peut t'assurer  100 % de ce qu'il sera une fois adulte, car un chaton est un bb et a besoin de beaucoup de contacts physiques. En grandissant, il est normal qu'il volue et en ait moins besoin, le contraire prouverait qu'il a eu des manques affectifs  combler.   En finalit, ?a va dpendre beaucoup de ta propre attitude envers lui, alors vu ce que tu dis, je crois qu'il n'y aura pas trop de problmes, ce sera un chat aim et aimant !  Si tu veux, viens nous raconter quand tu auras adopt le minou, ce serait sympa.  (Dsole pour la longueur de ma rponse, je suis bavarde sur ce sujet !)|`|N2MuZVmgaa	bonjour laura.  tu n'as recu que de tres bonnes reponses.  a toi de voir maintenant.  il faut juste savoir que ton chat t'aimera autant que tu l'aimeras, (meme s'il est trop independant a ton gout).  et c'est bien la l'essentiel.  reviens vite nous dire quel matounet tu as choisi, comment tu l'as choisi et aussi comment vous vous rendez heureux mutuellement.  belle journe a toi.|`|YGjYHsMuaa	Je pense qu'une peluche te conviendra|`|FrATqEk0aa	Bonjour,    Le seul moyen d'obtenir un chat qui correspond  ces exigeances (trs calin) est d'adopter un chat ADULTE. Tout simplement, parce que son caractre est dj tabli et que vous l'adopterez en toute connaissance de cause.  Si vous adoptez un chaton (surtout ne pas l'acheter en animalerie, on ne sait pas d'o ils viennent et sont spars trop t?t de leur mre), vous conna?trez son caractre de jeune.

Panther groupers are fairly slow-moving, ambush predators -- once accustomed to a tank, they will hang out near structure, but in the open water, slowly paddling their fins.    Miniatus groupers are a bit more reclusive, but like the panther, once the are used to the tank, they are in the open much more often.    When it comes to feeding, though, the miniatus will rapidly devour anything it thinks it can eat -- very active, and lightning-quick.  A panther will move faster than normal too, but nothing like a miniatus.    On a side note, both of these fish grow quite large (they are groupers, of course), and make lots of waste -- make sure you have a big tank and proper filtration.    I've always liked both groupers, and both are easy to keep, but the miniatus has a lot of color but the panther has a nice pattern.    Hope it helps!|`|0e473586f19e6d2ca1730f54927aba4faa	Panther would generally be more active but if you provide enough coverage and hiding places the miniatus may also be more active.|`|1d515245a4e55672060ad5bbd205c6b0aa	panther
V7AAba8Laa	A loose bull can be a very dangerous situation, and as the owner, your neighbor should be doing everything in his power to keep his animal under control, inside the fence, and on his own property.      The last time a bull got loose in our area, we actually had to organize groups of hunters to find it before it injured someone.  A loose bull can run into a roadway or kill a person if it feels threatened.  And some bulls are just mean and shouldn't be messed with!    Bulls, even young ones, are full of testosterone, and hormones in any animal can make them, well, stupid.  I know people who have stallions that have learned that the mare on the other side of the fence is well worth charging the electric fence for.  After all, it only hurts for a minute and they get to the ladies that way.  Sounds like your neighbor's bull thinks your flowers are worth the barbed wire cuts!      Are there other farms around that have cows that might be catching his attention, or is he getting loose just to munch on your landscaping?  Maybe his pasture is overgrazed or he's not being fed properly.  If he's in a paddock, the young bull might be bored.  Toys go a long way in entertaining livestock that can get bored or destructive.    Tell your neighbor to invest in electric, preferably a 2-3 strand set at the proper voltage for a bull (I think it's 5,000?)  He needs to handle this now before he's liable for personal injuries, not just your landscaping.  If your neighbor is unwilling to upgrade his containment, you need to file reports when the animal is loose and consider a nuisance lawsuit.  This may force him to get rid of the bull if he is unable to keep it under control.    Tell the bull's owner that yes, you can keep a bull contained, and yes, he is REQUIRED to do so.|`|AA11298562	Electric fencing, and talk to the county about your neighbor, he's creating a menace by owning an animal and then not keeping it under control, I'm pretty sure that's illegal.|`|wEOgLTwIaa	call the police, the neighbours are required to have at least electric fencing or wood fencing.|`|nIskOkn2aa	He's liable for all your damages, including your wife's pain and suffering.      Sue him.  That's the only way he's going to fix the problem, and you can't fix it for him.  He needs a better fence, and it'll be expensive.    If you don't get this handled now while the bull is young, he's going to kill somebody - maybe you! - when he matures and gets huge and nasty and roams at will.    I'd also try calling the local authorities.  Someone who negligently lets a bull roam off his property isn't fit to keep one and is endangering public safety!|`|lacVsr3kaa	Get a guard elephant

I've heard of people using the untreated wood pellets that people use for stoves. There is always the traditional route of using a paper-based litter like Carefresh or Yesterday's News. Some people use newspaper (which does not absorb the odour, but can work well in a pinch). Some people use the food pellets, which again, is something you'd have to watch for since rabbits can fill up quickly on fatty pellets. Some people use a mixture of hay and shredded paper.     Essentially, the theme here is that you should find a litter that is wood/paper-based that can absorb the smell. Stay away from anything that can harm your rabbit's respiratory system, like wood shavings and clay cat litters.     Personally I use Yesterday's News and for young rabbits, I'll sprinkle some Carefresh on top since it's softer and some rabbits refuse to use the hard pelleted litter.|`|YXhDR62taa	cat litter made out of recycled paper works great, also its completely safe for your pet|`|sr9Rv7xYaa	Recycled cat litter,  Its safe because if your rabbit eats it, it wont get hurt (:|`|wF7sCEM2aa	Fresh hay.

AA11826043	I highly suggest you corner the kitchen off with a baby gate that is high enough for him to NOT jump over.  Westies have springs for legs, as you will soon learn!  This will give him room to move around and play a bit.  Also, do NOT put down newspapers as this will only confuse the dog by making him think he can relieve himself indoors.  A crate is still a good idea, but it is cruel to leave him in there all day while you are at school, especially if there is no one there to let him out every once in a while.  Hopefully you get Christmas break from school where you are, so you can use that time to perfect his housetraining.  Westies are smart little guys, but they need an assertive leader to show them who is the alpha boss.  And that is YOU.    He should sleep in a crate anyways, so it is a wondeful idea to also get the crate.    You sound like you have done your homework, so I hope this advice helps you.|`|6cc6fd1fe3b70df0610f35449918bec2aa	I would go with the crate just because if he could possibly get out and he is stuck in there alone for 4-5 hours then he probably will and with a crate you won't have to worry about him.. we use a crate and it works out well, just make sure you put a toy or two in there with him and give him a treat when he goes in so he doesn't think of it as a punishment|`|7547aadba9316406b416545ed30adba7aa	don't listen to them.get a nice box  (not cardboard, but not that bad actually) and furnish it with a blanket and food bowls and stuff. make it big so that it can move at least 10 feet in each direction.|`|0f900e2aaad8d99fba561ce80e3f15c0aa	Both of my dogs have crates which they love.

Crates seem like a punishment to many people, but my dogs love their crates. It's their own private space and they will often go in on their own even while I am home.   The first time you put him in, be sure to put in a blanket with your scent on it so he doesn't get lonely, and give him a treat and praise when he gets in to show him it's a good place to go.

Neons sind in der Regel immer Wildf?nge, keine Nachzuchten. Sie leben in einem sehr, sehr weichen Wasser. Wenn man sie dann in unser viel zu hartes Wasser setzt, dann leben sie nicht lange. La? das im Auariengesch?ft abchecken. Schnapp dir ein Schraubglas oder einen Becher und flle es mit Aquarienwasser. Und ab damit ins Fachgesch?ft. Die sollen es mal untersuchen. Das kostet dich in der Regel nichts. Die schauen sich dann mal den KH, pH, No2, NH4, Wert an und dann bist du schlauer. Normalerwei?e sind Neons schon schwimmfreudige Fische. Oder hast du vielleicht auch zu wenig Pflanzen im Becken? Irgendetwas verursacht bei den Burschen auf jeden Fall Stress. Und gestresste Fische werden nicht alt. Wenn du Pech hast, dann werden sie krank und stecken die anderen Fische an. Du hast doch andere Fische, oder? Na hoffentlich sind die Neons nicht der Erstbesatz, weil dann seh ich schwarz....

Diese Fische kommen aus dunklen, schattigen, torfigen Urwaldb?chen. Deswegen dient auch der Leuchtstreifen zur gegenseitigen Erkennung, Orientierung untereinander und des Zusammenhaltes im Schwarm.    Also kommen diese Fische am besten zu Geltung, wenn ihnen eine naturgem?sse Umgebung geboten wird.     Das heisst: teilweise schattenspendende Schwimmpflanzen-Decke,  dunkler Hintergrund und dunkler Beckenboden. grossbl?ttrige, abschattende Wasserpflanzen (Amazonas) im Hintergrund, evtl. auch eine dunkle Wurzel einbringen und das Wasser mit etwas Torfextrakt anreichern.     Dabei soviel Licht wie m?glich (wegen Pflanzenwachstum), aber einrichtungsmassig versuchen, einen leicht duster/schummrigen Unterwasser-Eindruck zu erreichen. Besatzzahl nie unter 10 Neons, besser 20 bis 30 Tiere. Beckengr?sse ab ca. 200 Ltr. ist immer am besten (weniger pflegeintensiv durch bessere Stabilisierung des natrlichen Gleichgewichts).

58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	This question is controversial and it is also a subject of endless discussion, since we also need to know "What is life?"  Most bacteriology textbooks say Mycoplasma genitalium is the smallest known organism capable of independent growth and reproduction. Its size is given as 0.2 to 0.3 m (micrometers). A m is one millionth of a meter (or one thousandth of a millimeter). An average bacterium, like E. coli, is about 1 m by 3 m (it has a rod shape). A red blood cell is 8 m in diameter and the average human cell is about 25 m across.    Viruses are DNA or RNA that are unable to "live" without invading another cell and they use the molecular machinery of the host cell for metabolism and replication. "Are viruses alive?" is a philosophical question. They certainly have a life cycle and many would say that they are alive when they are infecting a cell. But whether they are alive or not, they don't have to carry around all the genes needed for an independent existence.    And then there are viroids. Viroids are small circular single strands of RNA that lack a protein coat. To date, they have been shown to only cause plant diseases. Their RNA can be as short as 248 nucleotides long (80,000 molecular weight), which can be less than 10 nm diameter.    What about prions? Prions are thought to be infectious protein particles that cause several diseases in humans and animals, including Mad Cow Disease. The latest theory is that Prions recruit proteins similar to themselves in the membranes of brain cells. By lining up next to these proteins, they cause a conformational change that converts these brain proteins into Prion proteins, which are about 30,000 molecular weight, or about 5 nm. (These proteins can't be broken down by the cell, so they form aggregates that clog the cell.) It might be a stretch to say that prions are alive, but for completeness, here they are. Somewhere from prions to bacteria you can say life starts, and there are the sizes...|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Nano-sized Hyperthermophilic Archaeon is the newest and smallest living organism found at this time.  The most commonly talked about one is Mycoplasma Genitaluim though, which lives in the primate genital and respiratory tracts and is a little larger than the other.  But, even smaller are those in the class of semi-living viruses.|`|5ca52f53f9cc7f26b389760670bd4e04aa	Viruses.|`|EO1ljdWQaa	Nanobes|`|7YJSs3fpaa	Viruses    The majority of biologists consider viruses to be non-living because they lack a cellular structure and cannot metabolize by themselves, requiring a host cell to replicate and synthesise new products. A minority of scientists hold that because viruses do have genetic material they can be considered as organisms. The smallest RNA viruses in terms of genome size are small retroviruses such as rous sarcoma virus with genomes of 3.5 kb and particle diameters of 80 nm. The smallest DNA viruses are the hepadnaviruses such as Hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb and 42 nm; parvoviruses have smaller capsids, at 18-26 nm, but larger genomes, at 5 kb. The smallest DNA bacteriophage is the Phi-X174 phage, thought to be larger than Hepatitis B, at about 4 kb. [1]    [edit] Nanobes  Nanobe  Nanobe  Nanobe  Nanobe    Nanobes are thought by some to be the smallest known organism, about ten times smaller than the smallest known bacteria. Nobes, tiny filamental structures first found in some rocks and sediments, are ten times smaller than the smallest known bacteria and were first described in 1996 by Philipa Uwins of the University of Queensland. The smallest are 20 nm long. However, some researchers believe them to be merely crystal growths, but a purported find of DNA in nanobe samples may prove otherwise. They are similar to the life-like structures found in ALH84001, the famous Mars meteorite from the Antarctic.    [edit] Nanoarchaeum    Nanoarchaeum equitans is a species of tiny microbe discovered in 2002 in a hydrothermal vent off the coast of Iceland by Karl Stetter. A thermophile that grows in near-boiling temperatures, Nanoarchaeum appears to be an obligatory symbiont on the archaeon Ignicoccus; it must be in contact with the host organism to survive. Its cells are only 400 nm in diameter, making it the smallest known living organism, excepting possibly nanobes, if the latter is considered to be living. Its genome is only 490,885 nucleotides long; as of 2005 it remains the smallest non-viral genome ever sequenced.    [edit] Mycoplasma genitalium    Mycoplasma genitalium, a parasitic bacterium which lives in the primate genital and respiratory tracts, is thought to be the smallest known organism capable of independent growth and reproduction. With a size of 0.2 to 0.3 m (micrometers), M. genitalium is an ultramicrobacteria smaller than other small bacteria, including rickettsia and chlamydia. However, the vast majority of bacterial strains have not been studied, and the marine ultramicrobacteria Sphingomonas sp strain RB2256 is reported to have passed through 0.22 m ultrafilter. A complicating factor is nutrient-downsized bacteria, bacteria that become much smaller due to lack of available nutrients. [2]    [edit] Smallest organisms in certain groups    [edit] Smallest reptile    The Jaragua Sphaero or dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus ariasae), a gecko in the Sphaerodactylus genus, is the world's smallest known reptile species, at 16 mm long. The species was first described in the December 2001 issue of the Caribbean Journal of Science by Pennsylvania State University evolutionary biologist Blair Hedges and University of Puerto Rico biologist Richard Thomas. The dwarf gecko is endangered and lives in Jaragua National Park in the Dominican Republic and on Beata Island (Isla Beata), off the southern coast of Hispaniola in Haiti. [3] The species's binomial name was in honor of Yvonne Arias, the leader of the Dominican enviromental group Grupo Jaragua. [4][5]    [edit] Smallest bird    The bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae) is the world's smallest known bird species and the smallest known warm-blooded vertebrate. M. helenae, called the zunzn in its native habitat on Cuba and the Isle of Youth, has a mass of about 1.8 g lighter than a Canadian or U.S. penny. The male is smaller than the female. Said to be "more apt to be mistaken for a bee than a bird," the hummingbird's wings beat 80 times per second and up to 200 times when mating. [6] The bee humingbird is said to eat half its total body mass and drink eight times its total body mass each day. Its nest is 3 cm across.|`|45PBaISXaa	VIRUS|`|HLlwUzaLaa	Prions are thought to be infectious protein particles that cause several diseases in humans and animals, including Mad Cow Disease. The latest theory is that Prions recruit proteins similar to themselves in the membranes of brain cells. By lining up next to these proteins, they cause a conformational change that converts these brain proteins into Prion proteins, which are about 30,000 molecular weight, or about 5 nm.|`|NEzsKMeEaa	the virus is the smallest living organism on the earth.it can be seen only through an electron microscope.|`|ra1E25X5aa	The smallest living roganism on earth is AMEEBA|`|liGnB94taa	I don't know for sure, but I'd think that it would be bacteria  or viruses.|`|sEwxWtffaa	amoeba|`|ziwTj9Uaaa	VIRUS

If your dog cannot carry her own litter I wouldn't be breeding her any more. This is the most irresponsible thing I think I have ever heard of. Any vet who will do this for you should have his license yanked.The only needs you have considered here are yours, the ones that matter the least. Unless you dog is a Westminster winner, and I can safely say it isn't, just drop the whole harebrained. There are enough unwanted puppies in the world with out you adding to the problem to satisfy your own selfish needs. The idea that you bred your dog before scares the hell out of me. I would suggest finding a hobby, try trepanning. I will lend you my drill.

Try checking around the eye area, it's a difficult area to cut round the eye, and my yorkie came back very upset from one of his hair cuts and she had knicked hin with the scissors, it soon settled down, but just generally checking for cuts and things will give you a clue as to which hair clippers are best.  Don't read to much into it though, it probably just wasn't happy at leaving you, then coming back without it's fur, they quickly get used to it.|`|AA11597259	The clippers could have slightly scraped her skin.

If you really don't have time to walk your dog daily at least try to walk him or her on the days you do not work. The pay would be dependent on who it is.

We pay her $25.00 a visit.  If we only had one dog, it would be much less, I think $12.00.  If your looking for a sitter, make sure they are bonded and insured and have some real background in dogs, (vet tech, dog trainer, etc). Don't hire someone whose only qualification is that they love animals.  They can be clueless.

It could just be a reaction to something in his food. get your vet to do some allergy tests.    the perfumes have chemicals that can irritate your dogs skin and in some cases cause rashes. Next time you bathe him, try using tea tree oil shampoo. it is very gentle and has a natural scent. it will also make your dogs coat very glossy and healthy looking.    and about the bathing. you should not bathe your dog more than once a month. it washes away oils that protect the dogs skin and fur causing itchy flakes    also depending on what breed of you you have-if it is  a dog with a hairy bum, you can go get it trimmed. that will help cut down on that rear end smell.    also when you are bathing, you cannot get rid of a dog asss smell if you do not wash the dogs asss. gross, i know. but put on some rummer gloves, give it a little scrub, and make sure you rinse very well

The People's Republic of China Quarantine Service will not take any animals except cats and dogs.  Since all animals have to be quarantined, it is impossible to bring them in.  I was going to move to Shanghai with mine and I did all of the research without any luck.  One thing I did not try was an exotic pet license or special permission.      If you goggle importing pets to China, you will get a service and you can email them.  There are also books you can buy about living in China or Shanghai Culture Shock - I recommend them.    Good Luck!|`|b84334dc4c69c929f51e2aaa4f84ec25aa	yes|`|dI3bQ3xYaa	Wecome to Shanghai!

21231b5292f0c1e464c8334ee784ff0aaa	Wasserlinsen k?nnten der Verursacher sein  aber ich vermute den Bodenuntergrund (evtl. zu feinsandig), da deine sonstigen Angaben zu Messwerten ok sind.    Na, dann will ich doch mal ein bisschen von meinen Erfahrungen plaudern:  Deine Mess-Ergebnisse sind soweit alle insgesamt gesehen in Ordnung. Ebenso die Art der Beleuchtung und Timing (12-Stunden-Rhythmus wie in den Tropen).  Meine Aquarien standen meistens mind. so um die 10 Jahre ?ohne Komplettreinigung.  Das erreichte ich durch folgende Massnahmen:  1. monatlicher Wasserwechsel ca. halbes bis drittel Volumen.  2.Langsamer Aussenfilter (grosser Topffilter) befllt mit Tonr?hrchen fr bakterielle Filterung. S?uberung mind. 1x monatlich, und keine Benutzung von feinfaserigen Filterwatten. Verstopfungsgefahr durch zu schnelle Zusetzung = Durchflussverminderung.  3. Schneller Innenfilter zur Wasserkl?rung (Reduzierung der Schwebstoffe), mit angeschlossenem Sauerstoff-Diffusor (feinblasig eingestellt) zur Sauerstoffanreicherung, der gleichzeitig fr ausreichende Str?mung sorgt. Also keine Mulmeckenbildung (Reinigung dieses Filters fast w?chentlich).  Der Diffusor fhrt dem Wasser auch in der Nacht gengend Sauerstoff zu, da in dieser Zeit sich die Photosynthese der Wasserpflanzen umdreht, d.h. Sauerstoff verbraucht und Kohlendioxyd produziert.  4. Bodengrund 2-3 mm Kiesk?rnung, also keinen feinen Sand (verhindert Bodenf?ulnis = ist bekanntlich gr?sster Sauerstoffverzehrer), in Verbindung mit einer Bodenheizung.  Filterung im Dauerbetrieb laufen lassen und nicht zwischendurch abschalten. Durch Sauerstoffentzug sterben die im Filtermaterial angesiedelten Bakterien ab und setzen belastende sauerstoffzehrende Giftstoffe frei.  5. Saugwelse (kleinbleibende Loricaria-Arten) einsetzen, die putzend fast alles algenfrei halten.  6. Entfernung der Wasserlinsen mittels Teesieb, sie verhindern bzw. unterbinden die Photosynthese der darunterliegenden Wasserpflanzen wegen Lichtmangels.  7. Keine grosswchsigen Barscharten einsetzen, die durch ihren immensen Futterbedarf und ihrer Whlt?tigkeit das Aquarium unn?tig belasten, bzw. die Einrichtung ruinieren und unterminieren k?nnen.  8. Das Aquarium ?holl?ndisch fahren, d. h.: immer mit ?mehr Pflanzen als wie mit Fischen zu besetzen. Also genau das Gegenteil von einer pflanzenlosen Sardinenbchse.  9. Fttern nur soviel und solange wie restlos alles aufgefressen wird.  10. Beckengr?sse niemals kleiner w?hlen als mind. 200 Ltr. Fassungsverm?gen. Damit l?sst sich ein stabileres und gesnderes ?biologisches Gleichgewicht fast von selbst erreichen und halten.  11.

Welche Fische h?lst du im 28C. Je h?her die temperatur des Wassers, desto geringer sein Sauerstoffanteil.

Oliver|`|R1HnHAltaa	".. und natrlich erfolgt eine ausreichende "Wasserumw?lzung" ber "EHEIM-Thermoau?enfilter 600 Professional"    Das ist schon mal gut. Aber wieviel Oberfl?chenbewegung ist zu verzeichnen? Je nach Stellung des Filterauslasses kann es imAquarium den Kies wegpusten und trotzdem eine fast spiegelglatte Wasseroberfl?che haben. Ein bisschen Wellengang ist dem Gasaustausch im Aquarium sehr f?rderlich.  Die Temperatur ist definitiv zu hoch, da tun 2 bis 3C weniger Wunder. (24C ist auch den tropischsten Bewohnern genug.)  Und das  nicht nur , weil in w?rmeren Wasser weniger Sauerstoff gel?st ist, sondern auch, weil bei Fischen und Mikroorganismen der Sauerstoffbedarf bei h?heren Temperaturen signifikant ansteigt. Und damit bist Du mittendrin im Teufelskreis. Wenn die Fische sich anstrengen mssen, um zu atmen, beschleunigt sich der Kreislauf (Herzschlag, Blutdruck), was wiederum einen erh?hten Sauerstoffbedarf durch schnellere Atemfrequenz mit sich bringt.  Ich wrde die CO2-Zufuhr etwas drosseln, die Beleuchtungszeit um 2 Stunden reduzieren, die Temperatur senken und w?chentlich 10% Wasserwechsel mit einpl?tscherndem, kaltem (so etwa 18C) Wasser machen.  Fr die Nacht wrde ich einen Sprudelstein empfehlen. Da die Pflanzen nachts auch Sauerstoff verbrauchen, ist der damit verbundene CO2-Austrieb nicht so tragisch, da ja wieder CO2 zugefhrt wird. Damit solltest Du das Problem eigentlich in den Griff kriegen.

YpEswTQdaa	Hi.    I don't always use nest boxes,however with certain Does(Females) or New mums,i often do. I know MANY breeders,who don't & have never had problems. Also the cage/hutch size plays a role,since large cages/hutches are better off with a nest box,for the Kits(Young) as soon can prematurely venture out of the nest & die of the cold,where is smaller cages this is less likely to happen. Does cannot return the Kits to the nest,thus meaning if not quickly retrieved by the owner,s/he may die.    Most litters i have in the summer,i don't use nest boxes,never have had a problem so far. However litters closer to winter i occasionally do. However,sometimes a Kit may still cling on to the mothers teat,when she jumps out of the nest box,the Kit is unable to climb back into the box,normally resulting in death.Where,if it was a ground nest,it may of survived. Its happened to me before,sadly As long as she has made a nice,snug nest then she will be fine.    Hope this helps & best wishes.xxx|`|knvSmMB0aa	Give her a nest box.    I've raised, bred, and shown rabbits for a long time now, and as a professional, I know that they need this.  You're right- they don't get a box in the wild- but do they get nice little pieces of cloth?  Give her SOMETHING, even if it's a cardboard box.  She made the circular pattern, because she wants to keep them in, because it is not safe for baby bunnies to be rummaging all thoughout the cage.  Just as a dog needs a whelping box or a bed, so do they.  You see, in the wild, rabbits will find some sort of crevice to have their babies in, just as birds do.  They'll carry hay, and usually(normally) pull out their own fur.  It's amazing to watch a momma getting ready- give her a box with some hay/straw, and she will feel so much more comfortable.  The babies will also feel more secure and supported.    Congrats on te babies!    Autumn|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	We always used nest boxes for ours.  In the wild, the rabbits will typically find something that encloses the nest that they're making (in thick brush or briers, under roots, etc.).  It affords them a sense of comfort, since even tame rabbits retain a lot of their wild instinct (such as knowing how to make a nest).    But as long as you give them plenty of hay and such, they'll use what they want.  They cover enough to protect and keep their babies warm, and they'll ignore (of if its hay, eat) whatever is left over.    What kind of rabbits do you have (I can't view the link, I'm at work)?
Bw18seFqaa	I knew that.    Having a hairless dog, I can tell you that they do also release some type of body oil thru their skin, but not much.  When my Crested gets hot, his skin does tend to get kind of moist and "sticky"    Dont know if its actual sweat, or some other body oil, but small amounts are released.|`|TZT0SCZSaa	Yes.  They also lose heat by panting.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	I don't know if it's common knowledge but, yes, I knew that.|`|FncFYplJaa	Hmm, that's interesting.

oDVx7nSxaa	The wrong dosage of aspirin - even baby aspirin - can be lethal to cats.  Call the vet and ask - do not rely on someone who answers here, as the wrong advice could be fatal to your cat.|`|m16gf9mzaa	No! Aspirin in particular is toxic to cats.  It will kill him.  Never give a pet any OTC medication unless specifically instructed by your veterinarian to do so.  The vet should give clear dosing instructions. And if you get mixed up or forget those dosing instructions, it is the vet that you should contact with any questions.  Please contact your vet's office to ask them if there are any safe medications that you can give this cat for the pain.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	I would recomend that you find a different vet that is willing to take sick or injured animals on an urget or emergent basis every day.      NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER EVER give people medicine to an animal, unless your vet tells you exactly what to give and the exact dosage and you have a good understanding of what you need to do.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Hi   Sometimes small doses of baby aspirin is given to cats for emergencies. Aspirin can kill a cat so I would not.    How about just calling a different vet for this or asking your regular vet to prescribe proper pain meds if they are needed.   Not every vet in your area will be full, get the yellow pages|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Don't use the aspirin.  One small dose might not be a death sentence and the relief will not last.  Then you will be tempted, "Oh, I'll just give him another".  By the time you have really relieved any pain you will have gone too far with it.    Humans are too inclined to try to "fix" everything and generally pop a lot of medication at the first sign of discomfort.  You will be treating your cat properly when he sees the vet, gets the wounds cleaned up, maybe gets some antibiotics to prevent infection, and pain medication if the vet feels its indicated.    You are doing the responsible thing by seeing the vet.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes - aspirin can be toxic to cats.  Unless the vet prescribes a certain dosage do NOT self medicate.|`|CGxnLNWOaa	no way!|`|yjNoIzGBaa	It is never recommended to give aspirin to cats   do not give  the only OTC NSAID medication that is safe for cats is ketoprofen  or commonly known as orudis  do not give any other over the counter medication   as this can be fatal especially TYLENOL    very toxic  if he is vocalizing then he is in pain   if he isn't then he should be fine until you can get him in there on friday   however it is very common for an abscess to form so clean it very well with warm water and a little hydrogen peroxide   if it closes and you see it starting to fill with pus then you need to drop him off at the vet which can be usually done at any time   rather than wait for an appointment|`|gasBBNzCaa	no...don't give him the aspirin.  it contains acetaminophen which is very toxic to cats. It can cause a variety of problems such as severe liver  failure.  Just keep your cat indoors until you can get him to the vet.  Just make sure to keep an eye on the ear to make sure no infection begins.  When he's at the vet, you might want to ask about testing for certain diseases that can be transmitted through bite wounds/fighting.
11426a3fb135256eff3d1cf09ba85994aa	The puppy injections arent to protect you and your son.  They are to protect your dog from other dog infections.  No need to worry.  It may be a good idea to get the vet's contact details from the previous owner to double check the injections have been done.  Otherwise, you will have to pay for them again when your dog may not need them.    Good luck!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	you can always ask for the name of the vet she took the dog to and see what they say|`|fCSynjWjaa	If you speak to the vet and they confirm it's been done then all is well.    If the owner won't give you the vets number then don't give money to bad breeders. You could go get a nice dog from rescue.    Bigger problem though - dogs and 2 year olds are a very tricky mix. Can't leave them alone together safely and both will want all your time.|`|ClHTCyogaa	Save up some $ and buy a Lab they are the best with kids. They are the Best dog there is if you ask me.|`|vwC7klVVaa	The only thing that could be passed on to you son is if the dog has wormers so if you do get it i would suggest you make an appointment with your vet to get it started on it's  shot and also start a worming routine.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No responsible breeder would give you a puppy with a two-year-old child, so that is your answer.  A responsible breeder would know that puppies can't handle the stress of young children and a two-year-old child would not know how to be kind to a puppy.  You do not have enough time to train a puppy and spend time with your child.  Puppies are a lot of energy and a ton of training and it is not fair to your puppy or child.  Since the breeder does not have proof of shots, your vet will require you to get the shots all over again.  The state needs proof of shots, and vets just can't take the word of the breeder that they may or may not have had them, and this should concern you also.  I think you are making a terrible mistake.|`|iVQULHqYaa	IF the dog has had it's injections the owners vet will confirm this.I would investigate this because if you risk giving the dog additional injections it could harm her.    The Springer could be a handful if it is 29 weeks and has not had any training. I don't think that there are any health risks apart from worms that he could pass on to your family, however he might  jump at your son and knock him over. A Springer Spaniel is a handful.|`|F27az9NEaa	I wouldn't buy a dog from that person, if they didn't even take the dog to the vet there is obviouslly an issue.  Did the person say why they were getting rid of the dog? Is this person selling puppies?  Why wouldn't the owner have paperwork to prove the vaccinations?  I would definitely not purchase a dog from this person, their motives seem questionable and they don't seem very responsible. I wouldn't want to support such behavior.|`|0SHAY9TQaa	No paper work ---> Probably means the dog hasn't had shots. This owner may be lying.    Catching something? It depends. What shape does the dog seem to be in? Healthy. If I were you, I would take the dog to the vet ASAP for safety sake.    Good Luck :)
AA10283080	I personally think it's time we take it upon ourselves to start spaying and neutering humans who are not fit for breeding. If their parents were raising them right they would have never thought of doing something so inhumane.    Those kids deserve jailtime.|`|p8UAIAisaa	Actually, the story here was that 2  8 year old boys took a doberman and I believe it was another kind of dog and broke into a NO Kill cat shelter and did indeed kill 1 cat and injured several others. These kids should be prosecuted for animal abuse and cruelty regardless of their age. The knew exactly what they were doing. The parents should also be responsible for damages as well.  Apparently, the dogs belonged to a neighbor of one of the kids.|`|ZT0K3q2Aaa	The fact that those kids tortured animals at such a young age, is definitely a sign of worse behavior in the future.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Any hamster, whether Syrian (aka Golden, Teddy Bear, Panda) or dwarf (Campbell's, Winter White, Roborovski, or Chinese) can have a temperament anywhere from sweet to yikes!     No hamster type (Syrian or dwarf) is more or less likely to bite - it's all about how they've been raised and how much you work with them!     You'll hear a lot of people here say "Don't get a dwarf, they're mean and they all bite." This is like saying all red cars are faster and get better gas mileage - it's just not true.    Whatever type you choose,  you want a male. Female hamsters, no matter what type, go into heat every 3-4 days. This means they're crankier, more aggressive, harder to tame, and are more cage defensive. For everyone out there with a really sweet female hamster - yes of course they exist, I'm just pointing out that as a starter, or newer hamster owner, males are much easier (plus you don't have that chance of bringing home a pregnant hamster!).    Here's what I'd suggest, and some characteristics for the different types :)    Syrian hamsters are larger, that does make them easier to hold for little hands. They love being brushed (lots of people don't know that - toothbrushes make great hamster brushes!) and they come with coats that range from short to long and everything in between! They tend to be less fast than the dwarf species, but aside from running in their wheels, a lot of people find them less interesting to watch (please don't boo me people - it's true!) although they can be a hoot to watch scooting around in a hamster ball!    Dwarf hamsters are FAST. I personally love dwarfs because they're fun to watch and are quite active, sometimes when you least expect them to be. They also enjoy brushing if you can get them to sit still. They're quite active in hamster balls - just make sure you get a size appropriate one. They only come with short fur, and the color choices aren't as vast.    I'd look for a local breeder in your area. The hamsters they have will have been handled more than your typical pet store hamster although there are *many* great pet stores out there that are great with their small animals!    Wherever you go, (and bring a parent if you're under 18 yourself because there are rules about holding/touching them without someone over 18 at almost every pet store). Look at the different hamsters. I encourage him to pet, touch or hold all of them. See if there's one that you like more than the others.    You can also check to see if you have a local small animal rescue, or if your local animal shelter or vet has any that need homes!    In my opinion, the best hamster is the one that when you see it, you just *know* it's the one for you. All the other care and handling and feeding information is virtually the same, and you'll find lots of advice here as well.    I'm very open to further questions and such, so please message me if you want anymore info :)    Good luck - I know that was a long read :)|`|10eguzBCaa	think u should get a syrian easy to handle and loving good luck xx|`|7TuMvfraaa	syrians just because they get bigger as adults and are easier to handle..|`|aqarrEGIaa	i like dwarfs just because theyr smaller.  (campbells)|`|qGy9fR7xaa	I love syrians. I think it's nice that dwarf hamsters can live in pairs or group, but i think with syrians they're easier to handle, there's more to hold, and they sit still for longer!!!|`|96B9JiBGaa	I like both!  But right now I have a syrian, they're easier to care for as Dwarfs are very fast.    It doesnt really matter what type of dwarf (Though I would advise not to get a Chinese dwarf, they bite sometimes and are harder to train) roborovski hamsters are the fastest I think though.   Winter whites dwarfs are really cool because they turn white in the winter!    So yeah; If you want a little challenge choose a dwarf , If not Syrians are the way to go! =]
tPGxPDvBaa	Sounds like mange or possibly had fleas bad & rubbed/scratched hair off. Vet can be a skin scraping & give you a diagnosis.  All dogs have a certain amount of mites on the skin, it is only the ones that have immune deficiency that causes the mites to multiplying & cause problems. Probably with treatment & getting him healthy he will be fine.
gJBqAXwtaa	well i have owned 5 chihuahua's in total and 1 pomeranian   the chihuahua's i've had no porblem with and i currently have 3 of them they are loving and loyal and sooo sweet not one has EVER bitten anyone   it's a steroetype about small dogs (chihuahuas in perticular) they are not yappy mine don't bark at all apart from when i'm playing with them!!!  they give sooo much affection and are not over the top enerygetic.  on the other hand  i once owned a pomeranian and it soo sweet un til i found that it tended to nip quite alot and then one day i was in the lounge with my son (who is 13) and he was sitting with her and stroking her when she suddenly jumped up and bit him really hard on the chin, it bleed alot and i got rid of her i would never go back to getting a pom now,  as cousin now has one and it is very livly and still nippy  i know this doesn't account for all dogs but i would reccomend you get a chihuahua from my experince they are a much calmer and happier dog  hope this helped  xxx|`|8U40dDtEaa	Pomeranian id say....i have a chihuahua not that good with small children..to over protective|`|lQfRoF79aa	here is some files about the two adorable dogs:    chihauhau:    Temperament    The official AKC standard for the breed describes the Chihuahua as A graceful, alert, swift-moving little dog with saucy expression, compact, and with terrier-like qualities of temperament. However, some Chihuahuas carry saucy and terrier-like to extremes and are grumpy, haughty, or downright nasty when provoked  and provocation may come easy.    The tendency to be temperamental, a reputation for being suspicious of everyone but his owner, and a clannish dislike of any breed but his own makes the Chihuahua an unsuitable pet for households with small or boisterous children. On the other hand, he may be perfect for an elderly couple or individual, a pet owner who loves to pamper, those who live in apartments, and those on limited incomes.    Unfortunately, the Chihuahuas innate curiosity, intelligence, and loyalty to and affection for his owner often get lost in the oft-repeated description of the more prominent features of his temperament, but in the right circumstances, he is a wonderful companion.     Health    This is a long-lived breed, often achieving 16 or more years of age. However, there are some genetic diseases that can cause problems. Like most toy breeds, the Chihuahua is susceptible to slipped stifles (a knee injury caused by joint weakness) and fractures and may suffer from jawbone disorders, eye problems, heart disease, and tooth and gum complaints. The potential for some of these problems can be minimized by buying from a breeder who tests breeding stock for inheritable problems and by careful management. For example, Chihuahuas should not be allowed to jump off high furniture or out of your arms as the impact on landing could fracture a leg. Children should not be allowed to carry a Chihuahua or to play roughly with one for the same reason.    The Chihuahua is also born with a soft spot on the top of his head that may not fully close, so a blow here could kill him.    The Chihuahua tendency to shiver or tremble is not a health issue but takes place when the dog is excited or stressed. One explanation is the toy dogs have a higher metabolism and so dissipate body heat faster than larger dogs. Shivering helps to generate body heat  thats why people shiver when we are cold. However, rapid dissipation of body heat is a distinct disadvantage in cool or cold climates, so Chihuahuas should always be protected when taken outdoors in these areas. Fortunately, there are dozens of styles of protective sweaters available.    The Chihuahua as pet    The Chihuahuas loyalty and affinity for being close to his master or mistress makes him an amiable companion, and his size makes him a convenient one. Chihuahuas have been known to ride about inside a pocket, in a purse or tote bag, or tucked firmly under the arm of their owners. They fit nicely in soft-sided pet carriers for an airplane ride or a jaunt in the car, and they enjoy outings immensely.    At home the Chihuahua is curious and mischievous. Left to his own devices, the little guy might decorate the entire house with a roll of toilet paper, make confetti out of the mail, or commandeer your bed or favorite chair as his own. Although he is not much bigger than a minute, he could also wind up as master of the household, for he can manipulate owners with great finesse.    Chihuahuas have a distinct liking for others of their own breed and an equally distinct dislike for dogs of other breeds. Therefore, if you want more than one dog, make the additional dogs Chihuahuas. And if you already have a dog of another breed, consider carefully before getting a Chihuahua.  Dangers    Like other small dogs, the Chihuahua faces a danger outdoors that does not threaten his canine cousins that weigh more than 15 pounds  he is just the right size for a meal for a bird of prey or a coyote. Large hawks, eagles, and owls have been known to swoop down on pets and carry them away, and coyotes are becoming a common danger in some city fringes and suburbs.    The indomitable spirit of the Chihuahua also causes problems when the little dog spars with a large breed dog, especially one with a dominant personality or a high prey drive. It is best to always keep a Chihuahua on a leash or carried in arms so it cannot challenge a big dog to a duel it will surely lose.  Finding a well-bred Chihuahua    The Taco Bell dog has made it easier to find poorly-bred Chihuahuas to meet the demand of those folks who do not carefully select a breed to fit their family. That obviously self-confident and trainable little guy has lulled many families with children into thinking the breed is perfect for them, and they trot down to the nearest pet store or let their fingers do the walking through the newspaper ads or on the Internet. However, puppies purchased from these sources may be bred for profit without concern for health or temperament and the breeders and dealers may know next to nothing that will hel|`|gADpKFktaa	I have a chihuahua and my sister has a pomeranian.

Chicken, tuna, deli meats, baby food no onions, yogurt ect   Next kibble is garbage Listen to your cat!        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|D2sMKkchaa	Well then.You have already answered your own question and your question does not need answering again,take her to a vet.|`|NvwVmiaZaa	maybe it has kidney probs, did you give it all of it's shots?|`|CGxnLNWOaa	SORRY BUT SHE MUST BE SICK!

a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	I adore animals too!  I also do a lot of the things that you listed.  But I don't want to be an animal cop I am a dog trainer.  And my dog Lady sleeps with me. :)  I really take care of the animals I have too and I think that that is very important.  Here is My animal schedule  Here is my Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Schedule-  Daily Morning-  Wake up and take Jake the 9 year old Pomeranian out of his kennel.(he is old and has problems controlling himself at night when he is lose) and Lady my 7 year old Dachshund goes down her home made doggy ramp from my bed.(I have a ramp to make sure she doesnt injure herself jumping down with her long back).  I take both dogs outside to relieve themselves and stretch for 5-10 minutes.  When I come back in I give both dogs and Bella the cat their daily amount of food in their individual dishes.  Jake his senior dog food, Lady her lamb and rice dog food for her skin allergies, and Bella her indoor cat formula cat food.  Then also give Lily the 18 year old Red Eared Slider Turtle her food.  Then I give Lady her seizure meds. and give both dogs their morning dog treat.  After that I rinse and put fresh water into the shared dish of the dogs and Bella.  Once they are taken care of I take the two Cockatiels Milo and Chico out of their cage and put them on their gym up top.  While they are up there I check and refill when needed their food and  I rinse and put fresh water into their two water dishes.  Then I get fresh paper and change the bottom of the cage.  Then I change Bellas little box.  When all of the animals needs are taken care of I hold and play with Milo and Chico for about an hour.     Daily Afternoon-  I get Lily out of her take and let her walk around the house for an hour or two and yes the other animals leave her alone.  Then I let Milo and Chico out of the cage for another hour to play.     Daily Late afternoon/Early Evening-  I work with Lady on her tricks and commands for around 20-30 minutes.  Then I take both dogs on a 45 minute to an hour walk.  I make sure that they at least see one of their human or doggy friends.  The when we get home a snuggle with all the animals.    Weekly-    I do a full cleaning on the bird cage taking out perches and scrubbing them and I change up their toys.  I change Lilys tank. Then I also brush both dogs and the cat.       Monthly-  Jake gets a full groom-Ear cleaning, Teeth brushing, Brushed, trimmed up, and nail trimming.  Lady gets a full groom-Ear cleaning, Teeth Brushing, brushed, hair on feet trimmed, and nail trimming.  Both dogs get preventative   Here is a photo Album I did of my pets-  http://s267.photobucket.com/albums/ii319...  P.S.

07d1bb9dd42e42c299c5bae54c21e662aa	There are two answers to this depending on the age of the kitten.    If the kitten is 3 or 4 weeks old or older, you simply put out solid food for them.    We have the best luck using two bowls of food and letting the kitten choose how much from each they want. The bowls are: one dish with "wet" food--canned food--in it. And one bowl with dry food in it. The dry food is kitten chow made by one of the companies. The kitten cat chow is made in smaller bits than the adult cat chow so the kitten can get it into their mouth and chew it more easily. Because they do not yet have large strong jaws the wet food is very well liked by them, as they have no problem chewing that at all. But do not fail to give them the dry food, as well, since the dry food develops their mouth and teeth and digestion.    For tiny kittens from age 1 day to about 3 or 4 weeks, you have to use a dropper for a while. The only time this becomes necessary is if the mother cat has died for some reason, otherwise they nurse.    In this case you should buy some kitten milk formula (NOT expensive), mix it up per the directions, and feed it to the kitten with a dropper. Just hold the kitten with one hand and put the dropper in the kittens mouth with the other hand. The kitten usually is quite anxious to eat, so this should be pretty easy. You will want to feed them about 6 times a day, if you have the time. Once they are old enough to start walking around, roughly 3 weeks, you can start to introduce them to the solid food, both wet and dry.    Tip: Milk is not something that vets ever say to give to kittens. Something like 50% of cats get diarrhea from milk, so feeding them milk is not the way to go.|`|w7tS4aFHaa	When we hand rear kittens at that age we feed them every 4-5 hours or so.    We mix wet food with Cimicat which is a powdered milk especially for kittens and cats needing extra nutrition. The 'milk' mixed with wet food makes it nice and sloppy and easy for the kittens to eat.    You might also need to help them defaecate as well after they have eaten.    As they get older they will start to eat bigger meals less frequently.|`|UqfjfWk4aa	You should try feeding it once in a while to see if it's hungry.  When it gets a little older, you could train it to remember where its food bowl is and it can eat by itself whenever it's hungry.|`|5QvVxMzYaa	Feed them small amounts and often as they are growing and need plenty of nourishment to help them grow but do not over feed them as they can get little pot bellies.  As they get bigger have set meal times so they are not always demanding food.|`|J41MIeEcaa	Try a quarter or a cup, I feed my 4 month only kitten a half of a cup.

The bag of dry KITTEN food ( Purina One for kittens ) said they should eat 1/4 cup twice a day. She wasn't eating that much and I had been a little worried, but she seemed to be happy and energetic and and growing. I offered her dry food all the time, and I put out another bowl twice a day ( morning and evening ) with dry food that I had put some warm water in. She would eat some of the dry food and some of the moistened food. She seems to be doing fine. She's 11 weeks old now and no longer wants the moistened food. I have dry food down for her to eat as she wants to. I think they call it self feeding. She's strong and healthy and growing well, so it seems to be working. Cats are not like dogs. They will eat only what they want, even if there is more available, where a dog would most likely eat too much. You kitty is YOUNG, but if it seems to be eating on it's own, I would try the above. Good luck and enjoy !|`|Rzf77RRaaa	OMG please feed them every 4 hours, why are they still not nursing?
ade8f93324e40abc21994b228d41bf2aaa	E' raro che una persone piange nel vedere che gli animali di compagnia superano di gran lunga l' amore tra gli uomini. Anch'io piango per queste manifestazioni di queste creature che chiamiamo animali. L'estate scorsa ho registrato dei cani che facevano cose incredibili e tutti quanti erano  contrassegnati di vicende in cui il cane era protagonista di eccelsi comportamenti versi i disabili. Ogni volta che me li rivedo non posso fare che piangere nel riscontrare che delle meravigliose creature ci danno pi di quanto diamo a loro.  Se riesco a trasferirli nel pc, ti prometto che sarai la prima a ricevere questo materiale trasmesso dalla " La 7 "    Baci Piero|`|0n2i4KmYaa	Spesso... la mia gatta quando mi vede triste si sdraia nelle mie gambe e mi fa le fusa...  veramente molto sensibile e dolce!  Ciao|`|sGM0sIz3aa	La vita ti ha dato poco per esser felice, ma rendi felici gli altri.  E i tuoi animalini, ti vogliono bene, perch sentono che sei una persona speciale ricca, pi di mille altre persone, forse  proprio la tua sofferenza che ti costruito cos buona, cos... Splendida...  Non cabiare mai.  I miei animali mi danno molte soddisfazioni, e sono i figli che non potr avere, sono anche loro per me la mia vita.  Non ho un problema grosso come il tuo, ma soffro spesso di depressione, a causa di problemi famigliari e di un vecchio incidente e i miei animalini mi rendono forte.  Continua cos.

Avevo 8 anni circa e avevo 3 fratelli di10 7 e 5 anni, i  miei si erano separati e vivevamo in una casa di campagna con mia mamma, la quale lavorava e ci lasciava a casa soli fino a sera, e l'inverno il buio arriva presto. Il ricordo e' vedere i miei fratellini piccoli con in braccio i cani che avevamo rannicchiati su dei gradini al freddo coperti ad aspettare di vedere le luci dell'auto di mia mamma che tornava da lavoro. Io ero grande dentro e anche i miei piccoli fratelli ma quel gesto che si ripeteva la sera era tenero e mi e' venuto in mente adesso dopo anni che non ci ho mai pensato. Mi hai regalato un emozione oggi , una bella e malinconica emozione.  ciao e buona giornata e GRAZIE|`|roC1v3s9aa	non riesco a pensare cosa succeder quando il mio lillo(gatto) non ci sar pi...l fine del mondo...|`|0XVvoCaIaa	il mio hopper mi conforta ininterrottamente . concordo con te sulla falsita' moralista di alcuni puntaindice .|`|r2VXXH0Laa	Hai davvero ragione .... spesso il mio cane mi ha dato pi delle persone e soprattutto pi delle persone sa farmi capire quanto mi vuole bene, un bene sincero, pulito, totale come la sua dedizione.  Penso sempre anche io ai bambini in difficolt, ma come te ritengo che di finti moralisti ne esistono tantissimi.  Ho sentito parlare spesso della pet-therapy e so che per molti bimbi  importantissima.  Io ho sempre sognato di poter far crescere vicini un figlio con Rufus (il mio cane) perch lui con i bambini diventa meraviglioso ..... purtroppo i figli non arriveranno mai, ma Rufus c' e intanto mi godo lui e tutto il suo amore.

Loro quattro (ora sono solo due) mi hanno salvato da una profonda dpressione quando sono rimasta sola e mi hanno "indirizzato" verso un argomento che ho sempre seguito e sognato. Quello delle mostre cinofile.

Io dico che la terapia con animali andrebbe incoraggiata e sostenuta maggiormente. con le forze residue che hai, dai un calcio al moralismo di facciata e racconta la tua storia, in tv e non.

Ed  bello e piacevole occuparsi di loro e tenerli vicini, "utilizzarli" a volte, o semplicemente circondarsene. Questo non esclude che si possa anche amare gli umani e pensare a chi  meno fortunato, anzi lo rafforza. Mio padre mi ha sempre detto: chi non sa amare un animale non sa amare neppure gli uomini.

It is highly contagious.  It spreads like wildfire in a kennel/shelter setting.    Your vet is right, it can take weeks to clear up.  Eventually, your dog will stop coughing completely.      Just stay on top of the antibiotics, they'll do the trick & she'll be as good as new.    = )

B: sai bene cosa comporta avere un cincill?  ti copio quello che ho scritto ad un altro utente a riguardo.  io ho avuto 3 cincill, quindi mi considero "esperta".  innanzitutto, i cincill non son animali stupidi:sono molto sensibili e hanno caratteri molto diversi tra loro.  per esempio, i miei 3:uno era molto vivace e socievole ma arrogante e prepotente,l'altra era molto diffidente e l'altra ancora una paurosa.  i negozianti ti dicono che vivono bene in gabbia:FALSO.  la gabbia deve essere ENORME (di solito dicono che deve essere alta 50 cm e lunga un metro, ma i cinci corrono e saltano molto, l son sacrificati..l'ideale  una cosa lunga 2 o 3 metri e alta altrettanto ALMENO).  dall'altro lato ti sconsiglio di lasciarli in giro per casa,perch rosicchiano tutto:anche l dipende dal carattere, per i miei erano proprio distruttivi.  poi son animali da branco,  meglio averne due, da soli si deprimono..  io lo sconsiglio come animale domestico, perch  di difficile gestione..o hai una stanza apposta per loro dove li lasci liberi di girare e sfasciare tutto, o senn farli vivere in gabbia  una cosa crudele...  son bellissimi, e io li adoro, ma non li prender pi, perch non  semplice farli vivere felici salvando la casa.  io ora ho un coniglietto ariete, interagisce molto di pi ed  molto pi educabile!  in ogni caso non comprarli nei negozi, guarda su internet che  pieno di gente che li regala! sia i conigli che i cinci..    se mi contatti via mail... muzzapunk@yahoo.it  ma hai letto BENE quello che ti ho scritto di come si tiene un cincill? hai lo spazio e i soldi per dargli l'ambiente giusto?  comunque sui soliti siti li trovi..kijiji.it bakeca.it subito.it annuncianimali.it|`|1YrElP7jaa	spedirlo per sda? ma spero che stai scherzando veramente!!!!!  gli animali non si spediscono MAI!!!!!   spero vivamente  che sia uno scherzo!!!!|`|RA9CPxzwaa	ma che sda,poveretto...gli animali nn li puoi vendere  a distanza....morirebbe...  aspetta un tempo migliore x comprarla...e tieniti informata delle arrivate nei negozi,perch  x la mia cavia mi avevano fatto lo sconto xch erano appena arrivate e ne aveva tante...controlla|`|E513xjc8aa	cincilla' non si scrive cos ma chinchill.  Il nome chinchill sembra avere doppia origine:  1.poco plausibile  Il nome deriva di Chinche in spagnolo significa cimice tradotto come: "animale dal cattivo odore" ma in realt non  vero perch il chinchill non emana nessun odore  2.ipotesi plausibile  Il nome deriva dalla trib chincas che usavano la pelliccia dei chinchi per farsi i vestiti.  Questi animali vengono dall'america del sud e i loro peggior nemici sono gli uccelli come i condor.  Il chinchi rischio'di estinguersi x via della pelliccia molto pregiata. Ma nel 1918 l'ingegnere Chapman nell'arco di 3anni riusc a catturarne 12esemplari per allevarli in cattivit e salvare la specie.    DIMENSIONE E ABITUDINI DEL CHINCHILLA'  Pu arrivare a misurare i 30 cm(senza contare la coda) le femmine solitamente sono pi grosse e possono pesare fino agli 800grammi mentre i maschi non superano i 600  In cattivit possono vivere anche 20anni  E un'animale crepuscolare/notturno di giorno dormono. E curioso ama correre e saltare ma dipende come viene abituato il carattere vari da un'esemplare all'altro.   Non ama troppe coccole ma il maschio rimane pi affettuoso della femmina. Hanno bisogno di grandi spazi e la gabbia ideale sarebbe tipo il Voliera.  Mangia fieno, pellet, tutti i tipi d'insalata frutta secca e pezzetti di mela. Niente dolci e cioccolata.

40CUa5Iaaa	I think it's great that you're adopting an older dog, as usually these are the hardest ones to find a home for. Dogs adapt easily, particularly if they don't have any social, behavioural problems etc. like you said.     One good idea is that when she comes to stay with you, she may be a bit apprehensive of her new environment, and new people, and you, so give her time to adjust. It's also good to give her a cosy, safe, warm area that's hers to rest in. You can just put some old towels in a corner to set her up at first. Perhaps you can ask the owner to give her dog bed/ blankets so that the dog has something that has a familiar scent.     If you do decide to keep her, keep her routine the same as before, such as feeding times, type of food etc. Just to minimize any stress to her.     With an older dog, they are less playful and like to sleep a lot. Bringing her on nice walks (avoiding stairs, steep hills etc.) is a great way for you to bond with her. It's also a good idea to keep a close eye on her health (i.e. be able to tell when she's healthy or when she's unwell) because of her age.    Good luck! I hope it works out! Older dogs need less work than a new puppy. Wish you all the best.|`|8XA5K87vaa	Just get to know her, the good thing about rescue dogs is you can choose one that is perfect for you. With an adult what you see is what you get. It's nice that you're considering an oldie|`|b7u0Xhz5aa	Maltese are great dogs and will surely adjust to you with the condition that they recieve your unconditional love. It is a really good idea, and besides, shelters put dogs to sleep if they dont get adopted after a certain length of time. When she comes to stay with you just make sure that she likes you and will eat and acts healthy. With every breed there are some dificulties. Maltese are difficult to train but given that she is 9 and a 1/2 years old, she is most probably properly trained already.  Hope that helped!!! :D|`|lphW4stpaa	1.  They tend to get very lonely if the master is not with them and taken care of and it doesn't like being left out. This is because they were bred to be companion dogs and thrive on love and attention, and are highly social pets, which makes them great with other dogs, and cats.    2.  They enjoy running and are more inclined to play games of chase, rather than play with toys. This may differ if the dog is older.  Maltese can be snappy with littler children and should always be supervised when playing. They are also, like most little dogs, 'Yappy'. Romans would use the Maltese as 'Alarm Dogs', so most Malteses will have inherited this trait.    3.  Malteses don't generally have any difficult traits.  They thrive on attention and do not generally cause havoc, the are happy, cheerful, loving pets and do not enjoy being left alone.    I hope this was helpful to you, and enjoy having her to stay,  Maltese are brilliant dogs!|`|hcJXt2Opaa	I'm sure you'll be fine. Taking on an adult dog is so much easier than taking on a puppy.|`|E478z7XGaa	Look for her to use the bathroom in your house...  She is scared and disoriented.  Don't let that make up your mind... as she just needs to become familar with your house as her new house and your yard as her new yard.  Try to take her out at least once every hour and watch to see that she uses the bathroom each time.  Reward her with treats as well... you want to make a good 1st impression.  The breed traits... in our case....  they are very very sweet,  very sensitive,  enjoy your company and like to be in the room you are in.. as far as bad habits...  I have not noticed any in my 3 year old maltese.   Also, we have had NO health issues so far,  and we give her doggie vitamins every day.   Hope I was able to add to your already good answers.    Thanks for reading... and I hope she works out for you...

I show them the insurance for my cat and they do direct billing to the insurance company and I get a bill if there is something that is not covered ( my vet usually let's me know what is not covered anyway) Hope this helps
RJhNho8Daa	Although rabbits are fairly big for cats to be preying on, this is not unheard of.   My cat actually brought one home once, but it was a baby rabbit. (Aww.) Too bad it was dead.   I'm happy to hear that your cat has a Rabies vaccine; if your cat also hunts (rabbits or mice, or any mammal) be sure to renew the yearly vaccines because of the constant exposure to wildlife. Also, if your cat hunts, you need to have it dewormed more frequently than the average cat. Worms can actually be transmitted from prey to predator.   If Jonesy is homeless and tame, you should call a rescue, because stray cats usually do not enjoy a decent quality of life.|`|I515SMbvaa	Its quite normal actually cats will hunt to hunt they think there in the amazon he he :P but yes if your cat is leaving them on your door step or the same places over and over sounds crazy but its giving you a gift serious too.|`|rkufaNiPaa	Your cat is just bringing you presents. It sounds kind of weird but it is. Buy a coller with a bell on it and that might give the animal a warning when your cat is near. My cats used to bring bats, birds and all sorts of animals but now i got them a coller theyve not brought so much in but still have. A coller with a bell is the best idea.|`|4gmVCPj4aa	Its perfectly normal, but most impotatantly DONT tell him/her off for it! h thinks hes bringing you you're dinner! he thinks he being a good little kitty cat! bringing you presents lol. most cats get mice, but yours is special... i had a cat that used to catch pigeons and bring me live mice and frogs, ur lucky compared to me!|`|ffukmAIkaa	i agree with everybody on here, thats what outside cats do.  My inside cats when they catch a mouse they either put it in my chair or beside my side of the bed as a gift and look for their treat for being a good kitty.  And theres no way to break it its their nature to do that.  HUNT !!!|`|maOKPCi7aa	Thats what cats do, they are hunters.  |`|dWed21jUaa	that's normal.  My ferals leave bunny body parts all over the yard, door step, etc. You have to watch your step, there's usually something gross in the walk path lol|`|iG2JTrGaaa	Blimey, your cat must have very good hunting skills!  But then it had to survive somehow when it was a stray.  Of course there's not a lot you can do about it!
RJhNho8Daa	As a vet technician, I can vouch that any sort of food gift is never amiss within a clinic.     However, if you want to be more specific for the Vet who showed you so much care and concern go with a World's Best Vet coffee mug. Or any type of animal themed coffee mug. Most of them love things like that.   Thanks for taking time to express your gratitude! You sound like an awesome client! Glad your puppy is alright.|`|kRO55DHyaa	I noticed that my vet had a stethescope with a short binaural on it-it bothered me for some reason to watch him have to bend over and reach so far to listen to my dogs heart...I got him a Littmann Veterinary Scope that had a little more reach to it after he was particularly helpful with one of my dogs.  Not a cheap gift, but practical!  A thank you note with homemade salsa, baked goods, etc. are always good, but remember that the best gift you can give your vet is a recommendation.  You could write a letter to the editor of your local paper (small towns will print it, bigger cities-probably not) thanking her for going above and beyond, or taking out a small ad proclaiming your gratitude.  |`|440831a8a9801f00bae350794b079364aa	I suppose if she's having a good garden then a good quality bonsai would be a nice thing. It shows that someone out there would be able to take care of it. Also it's a good gift symbolically because it's lively and gives you a good feel being around.     Good Luck!|`|Ippd6MuPaa	A really nice card with a hand written note should do it.   You would be surprised how much the personal touch matters.  Cards with notes of appreciation mean much much more than things like boxes of Chocolate or other gewgaws.    |`|xWbTvkehaa	I don't know what you should get her, but if you know her really well, maybe get something like flowers and card. but if u dont know her well. i wouldnt go too over the top.|`|ReorIf0Naa	Introduce to ur sister .it he never forget ur gift.|`|3jewg0m5aa	That sucks, earlier this year mine got her leg stuck in a chairs backrest as she fell off, and had to get it reset as well as 2 pins in the bones and she is a tiny muti-poo.  Any way sad as hell so I can relate.  Hope all goes well and your puppy does not suffer pain.  I would think a thank you card would not only suffice but potentially make her day, Flowers are good too but maybe a bit much.|`|tdWGun54aa	give him a cute dog|`|Z1ZI62qTaa	A nice card  and a box of chocolates :)|`|AA10412922	Make a donation to a dog charity in her name,send it with a personal note from you. |`|tnTxHVO5aa	A Thank you note with a gift certificate to a nice restaurant.  
SOWFHn0eaa	A goldendoodle!!! These dogs are SOOO adorable and rarely shed.  My parents have one and he is the best dog we have ever had. Check  out this website! http://www.goldendoodles.com/home.htm    I promise if you get one ,it will be the best decision you ever make regarding a pet.|`|1ba70e8c04280c60c3a0a80ba37658c4aa	ALL dogs shed. Every single one of them. There is no such thing as a dog that does not shed.  You need to decide how much effort and $ you want to put into grooming. Dogs with long hair and undercoats need to be brush LOTS. golendoodles and spaniels need regular grooming that most people don't know how or just dont bother to do. Grooming can be anywhere from $15 to $200 per visit and most long hair breeds need to be done atleast every 3 months.      All dogs bark. Some will bark more than others, some breeds are more prone to barking than others but I have met huskys that don't make any noise and rotties that don't shut up (poodles are usually yappy and terrors to groom). Each dog has it's own personality, just like people.  Anyone that tries to tell you otherwise is just trying to make $ an lies.  Oh and 'goldendoodle' is not a breed, it's a mixed breed dog . Don't get suckered in to paying $1200 for a mutt  Out of the poodle's the standards seem to be the best behaved over all. They are not as over bred.  And I have not met a cavalier spaniel that I didn't like BUT I don't meet too many of them. American and English cockers can go either way  What you should consider when looking for a breed is what fits into your lifestyle|`|yxhnFE9gaa	A mini poodle. They are not noisy and really are smart and want to please you. Mini though not standard or toy.   Portuguese water dogs also are very much like a poodle and very cute as well.   Smart, small easily trained dogs are great and cost and space effective too.   GL    Dixi mays basenji suggestion is pretty cool I found a link    http://puppydogweb.com/caninebreeds/base...    I have to disagree on the all dogs shed.   Poodles and portuguese water dogs don't.   I live with two mini poodles and have never found hair anywhere and my brother has a portie. Plus they are hypo allergenic!  You don't have to have your poodles groomed into froo-froo cuts they can have puppy clips and not have there faces shaved which is great looking and cost effective.|`|1iIcuXFqaa	HI,  I reccomend the king charles Spanial. They are adorale and dont bark a lot and are GREAT pets.|`|FcCUhMAxaa	This has nothing to do with reptiles....  But I'd recomment a Labrador. But only if you're capable of their size. They are the perfect family dog. Happy, fun, intelligent, loyal and adorable.    By the way "common sense", this is untrue. A Basenji dog is the only dog in the world that doesn't bark. It isn't very common, but they're out there!|`|vb82mbFPaa	WHATEVER YOU DO PLEASE ADOPT FROM A SHELTER THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF DOGS WITHOUT HOMES BECAUSE PPL WANT PUPPIES PLEASE SAVE A LIVE ADOPT ONE FROM A SHELTER. HOPE THIS HELPS IN A ROUNDABOUT-SORT-A-WAY
vS1Z0inOaa	Bree pretty much covered everything, but I'd like to add that the general rule of thumb is 5 gallons for each inch of turtle if the turtle is under 4 inches and 10 gallons for every inch of turtle if the turtle is over 4 inches long. If you've bought babies from china town, I'm betting they're probably less than 4 inches all three of them put together, so your 20 gallon tank should be sufficient for now. However, you will have to expand eventually. Also, according to that general rule of thumb, if your RES were adults you would figure according to the size of the largest turtle and then add 30 gallons for each additional adult turtle. Female RES will grow to a full 12 inches long, so that would be a 120 gallon tank plus 60 to equal 180 gallons for the three of them as adults. However, if two of them happen to be males (you cannot tell now while they are babie) you likely will need to separate the two or possibly all three eventually, requiring you to have two or three large tanks or an outdoors pond for all three eventually.     I would like to recommend ZooMed's natural aquatic turtle food, hatchling formula. This pellet food is very small so the babies can easily eat it. This makes a good base. Also, in my experience, turtles from China Town have been starved a bit, and this seems to get them eating quickly. However, like Bree said, this should not account for more than 20% or so of the total diet, so feed them mostly feeder minnows or guppies (not goldfish), bloodworms, earthworms, gutloaded crickets, and the like if they are babies and mostly turnip greens, kale, watercress, spring mix (bagged salad mix), shredded carrots, and in small amounts romaine if they are 3 inches or longer. Supplement with vegetables for young turtles or supplement with meat for older turtles.     It would also be a good idea to make sure they always have access to a cuttlebone. I once had a turtle that woud always destro tank accessories by chewing, and another that ate gravel and eventually died of impaction. Both f these turtles did not have access to a cuttlebone. The one that chewed on accessories stopped when I started providing one. Some just seem to have a real need to chew and wear their beaks down and others appreciate being able to get calcium from it.     You'll also need to figure out your filtration strength according to the amount of water. Filters are rated to clean adequately for fish, and turtles are much much more messy than fish. So your filter needs to be rated for two to three times your tank size. With three in one tank, I'm leaning for three times. So for your 20 gallon tank, your filter needs to be rated for 60 gallons to be able to clean the water adequately.  Also make sure the basking area is larg enough for all three to sit on at the same time if they desire.     Another common mistake is to feed all the turtles at once in their tank. Oftentimes what happens when you do that is one turtle gets all the food and the other can't get at it or get as much of it. So the stronger turtle grows quickly getting stronger all the time while the others grow more slowly or sometimes even give up trying to get at the food. Also leftover food will dissolve and make a mess in the tank. It's better to get them on a schedule and feed them in a bowl one at a time. You can leave them in the feeding bowl for an hour and they'll defecate in there, making for even less mess in the tank. You can leave lettuce in the tank at all times and swap it out every other dayor so. You can also leave feeder fish in the tank at all times... But the pellet food and things like crickets and earthworms should be fed in the feeding bowl. Babies should be fed once daily 6 days a week and turtles that are 4 inches long or more should be fed three times a week.|`|Jguzosm2aa	To best care for them, you can't rely on what you'll find here. Open up google and search for care guides, care sheets, and information on RES. In answer to your first few questions, I can give you some basic information.    A 20 gallon is the bare minimum for one small turtle. You're going to need at least sixty gallons to house these guys together. RES are semi-aquatic, so you will need a set-up which allows enough swimming room but also a basking area where they can climb completely out of the water and dry off. Water in the tank should be twice as deep as your turtle is long. The surface length of the water should be five times the length of the turtle, and the surface width should be three times the length of the turtle. So lets say you have a six inch turtle. The water is going to be at least twelve inches deep, have thirty inches of surface area and eighteen inches of width. Turtles are quite messy, so you will need a filter to keep this water clean. Your tank will also need to be heated. Water temperature should be between 75 and 78 degrees. Ambient air temperature should be between 75 and 80 degrees. And there should be a basking area where the temperature is between 90 and 95 degrees. (Fahrenheit, of course) You should also provide a full spectrum UVA/UVB light.      RES are omnivores, though juveniles eat more animal protein than do adults. Diet options include live feeder fish, earthworms, crickets, waxworms, bloodworms, aquatic snails, fresh greens (Collard, mustard, turnip and dandelion greens are the best. Avoid head lettuces), aquatic plants, and shredded vegetables. There are also commercial turtle foods, which you may use, but they should never make up more than 25% of the diet. You will need to determine, at least roughly, the age of your RES, as juveniles need daily feeding, whereas adults may only need to be fed every other day.     You've just taken on quite a bit of responsibility. Good luck with them.|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	http://www.allturtles.com/ has a lot of good information and care sheets.  Please check it out, turtles need a lot of room and can be somewhat expensive to keep.  For the right people they make very rewarding pets :-)    While I commend your wanting to help them, in the future try to avoid buying animals to rescue them...  All it does is put money in the pockets of the people responsible, allowing or encouraging them to get more animals and do the same thing... As heartbreaking as it is, the best thing to do in situations like that is to boycott the place all together, and under no circumstances give them your money.    Good luck with your new turtles
CdRlOsnyaa	you should get a good filter and clean off the algea, the algea wont hurt them but it good to provide a stable diet if your turtles young feed it feeder fish crickets mini shrimp and tablet food if its older tablet food and fresh veggies, you can experiment with diffrent tablet food to see if they will like it more, have a good time with your turtles.|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	what is the regular food that you feed them?    you should provide fresh vegetables and fruit for them to eat. they probably want it!    Edit_    it shouldnt effect them,     but you should have a water filter on to clean out the algae, and keep the water clean. take out any uneaten food, just put enough that you know they will eat, and put in some fresh vegatables and cut up fruit, you will start to notice what they like and what they dont. put in lettice aswell, but wash it a lot because they have pesticides on.    they also love insects to eat, i feed mine meal worms. and make sure that yo uhave a basking lamp for them.    you should really join a forum for turtles. (just google turtle forum) they have some very experianced members on that can help you now and in the future.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	When turtles start eating algae it is a sign that they are ready to switch to a more vegetarian diet and you aren't providing the means for them to do that. Many kinds of turtles eat more vegetables as they get older. The algae won't hurt them but it does not provide the nutrition they need. Pellet turtle food should never account for more than 20% of any turtle's total diet.     I would suggest you start offering them things like turnip greens, kale, spring mix (bagged salad mix), watercress, shredded carrots, and in small amounts romaine and strawberries. They'll also likely enjoysome feeder fish, worms or crickets though since they've been eating algae you should lean more towards vegetables.

Depends on how big the litter is, but they feed a lot for the first week.

Especially when they are newborns, the mom will keep them clean and warm, if she is kept apart from them, they could get sick and she could have problems with too much milk in her udders causing swelling and infections.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	ask your breeding mentor.
ErSbeRlzaa	Sounds like you've done your research which is a good start and refreshing from those people who just dunk any fish in.     All the fish above are omnivores and eat anything, i use tetra flakes and freeze dried bloodworms for my fish, feed them twice a day but you could feed them once depends on your life style.  You could also feed them vegitables once a week/fortnight. I just blach a piece of cucmber and stick it in there (take it out after a couple of hours) - your cory's would probably enjoy it the most. you could also get sinking bloodworms for them which they love.  My lights are on for 12 hours per day as i have a planted aquarium but you could have them on for less. say around 10 or even 8.  Temp should be kept at 25 degrees.  Platties are hardy fish and can live in a wide range of ph. Gouramis are also hardy. Cory's and tetras prefer their water slightly acidic and soft but as long as you introduce them slowly into the water they should do fine and most likely thrive.  Hope i helped and gdluck  ps - remember to do regular water changes (once a week as your tank is fully stocked and youd want to keep the Ammonia/nitrate levels down)  &  Also do not add all of the above fish in at once add two or three a week or even every two weeks.|`|70MRFokCaa	yes its okay but get 6 instead of 8 cardinal beacuse they can get roguh and the fish might die

Try going to a pound first!|`|QGELppw0aa	Something cute, lovable, and furry that I highly recommend is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. They are categorized in the toy breeds, however they are the largest of the toy breeds. They are a very lovable breed and are commonly known for growing up and still looking like a puppy because of their fluffy little ears and happy faces. They are known for being a quiet dog, however it is important to train them early on to being alone or they may develop separation anxiety..not a difficult task to do the training, more so just may take some time as it requires starting out little by little. As I said, they are closer to a medium dog, getting about 12-14 inches in height at the shoulder, and around 12-18 pounds. They enjoy cuddling and make a great addition to the family. If you plan to have the dog live outside, then this isn't the breed for you, but if you want something that lives inside with you but is more than happy to get outside and run around with you in that large backyard they're great dogs. Research before buying any dog of course. Considering adopting from a shelter is always a wonderful idea as well! Good luck on you search!

maceiqG1aa	Raw feeding isn't usually prescribed by vets, but I don't know if you have talked with your dogs Dr. about this.  How do you know if it is the kibble that is causing loose stools and not the raw chicken and lamb? My newly adopted dog   has had many stomach problems and the one thing that helps her tremendously is a tbsp of pure yogurt every day.  Also, she is not on a raw diet, but on Wellness dry and cooked chicken breast.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Do what the previous answer says, and in the meantime give your dog canned pumpking. My sister uses this for her dog's diarrhea.|`|PM23RDycaa	Raw is less expensive if you find the sales, bulk in bulk and STOP using premades. Paying for premade raw is like buying kibble and is thus expensive.     A total clean switch to prey model will have loose stools for a bit until his body adjusts and you find the perfect bone amount, but in the long run is cheaper.     My personal feeling is this, with premades you do not the get the full teeth cleaning properties that come with tearing and chew flesh and chewing and crunching on bones.    Here are some sites and yahoo groups. This is for prey model - no fruits no veggies. At most the plant matter your animal will get (they need very little) can be found in green tripe (smelly but good)    http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/RawCh...  http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/rawfe...  http://www.rawfeddogs.net/  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html    ADD: Most vets don't agree with raw. When it comes to nutrition is makes of very little of the vet's overall education. They are taught kibble by the kibble companies.. This is not true of every vet but most do not agree with raw, but hey remember YOU pay them and can take your business elsewhere.    Two the loose stools are more than likely from the fact the dog is not getting enough bone in the diet. This is ALSO why I don't like premades, their ratios are usually off.    If he were getting actual bones his stool would have firmed up by now. Either stick with the high quality kibble or switch to raw. Also stop feeding raw and kibble together.    Raw digests faster than kibble but with kibble in his stomach it slows the process down.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Read this site about raw feeding.  My concern is your dog isn't getting a balanced diet. You can contact this lady on the site & ask her specific questions - she is nutritionist & the best one to ask & get correct answers.     http://www.rawlearning.com/|`|Y5FyAekkaa	DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT feed your dog a raw diet! Dogs are domesticated and can no longer properly digest and utilize raw meat. If the kibble is causing diarrhea then you should definitely switch to a higher grade food.  Cheap dog food contains lots of fillers which are not absorbed by the body and literally pass straight through.  Switching foods will also cause diarrhea. Make sure to gradually mix the ratio of old and new food until you are feeding the new food exclusively. I am asking you to seriously consider avoiding a raw diet, I have worked in veterinary medicine for a while and seen lots of puppies get sick and even die from deficiencies from raw diets.
UhRnMdmxaa	Try for between 10 and 12C this is low enough that the fish wont be confused but high enough to keep filter bacteria etc live and kicking.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	You only want your koi pond to be warm enough so a hole can be kept between the bottom and surface for oxygen exchange and the bottom doesn't freeze complely.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	if your pond is deep enough it doesn't need to be heated    or you could get one of those floating ring heaters.. they are like 9W and really just keep a patch or surface open in the winter    i personally let mine freeze over with no heating, it's about 3.5 feet deep|`|AA11063355	Get it up to 90C and the fish should be cooked to perfection in about ten minutes! I'll bring the chips round later.|`|f4X8C3V4aa	I live in NY and we don't heat our koi pond at all in the winter, but ours is deep enough that it doesn't freeze solid.     If you have expensive fish and are worried about them freezing, or just have a shallow pond (less than about 3 feet into the ground), I would reccommend putting them in a tank in your house for the winter.
RA3p25Qoaa	When crabs need new shells they either switch to a new one which takes a few seconds. if no new shell is around they will stay in the shell they have and not change even if they have to.     abandoning shell is a bad thing. it means the animal is sick or stressed. Check the conditions is your heat between 70-80f is your humidity 70% or up?    is there any damage on the crab?    Are their small white, brown or red dots moving around on the crab or the shells? these would be mites.     you can't take hermit crabs to a vet they can't do anything to help.     What you need to di is put a divider in the tank to keep he others away from him. You need to offer him the extra shells with hermit crab safe salt water in each. make sure the tank is humid and warm and hope that he will re-enter a shell. Crabs can survive out of the shell provided the tank is humid enough to keep them breathing. |`|oGVWdnHraa	The new shell might have been to small for him....get him an even bigger shell :)|`|0s89N6gCaa	He needs a bigger shell.|`|kZaKFbYgaa	it's time for a new shell. periodically they seek out a new one - it's normal.|`|JnGqPMskaa	crabs leave their shell when they out grow it. Get a variety of shells different sizes, it will find one it is comfortable with.|`|3Tqfmtxwaa	he needs a new shell. you need ones that are big enough for all 3 to move into when they need to. get a bigger one, then find out how big your other two need to be.|`|hFsKfYZXaa	Everyone else is right, he's looking for a new more comfortable shell.  Take his old shell and clean it in non-chlorinated water and then take a shell a little bit larger (if you have one on hand, if not get one as soon as you can) then put your nudie and the two shells in a glass.  You need to keep him safe from the other crabs because they could be encouraged to eat him.  He also needs a small, confined area so he can't go running into thing and hurt himself.  After a short period of time he should get the idea that he has to climb back into a shell.  Just be really careful of a nudie crab's abdomen if you handle him.  You might try using a spoon to scoop him up and put him in the glass.  Good luck.|`|SdS9Qcayaa	maybe he's looking for a mate|`|efXpR38oaa	GIV HIM A BIGGA SHELL MAN!  STOP READING THIS!  DO IT!  NOOOOOWWW!
TawyLobZaa	Yes. They are called Hemingway cats. (Not a breed. Just a characteristic. All polydactyl cats are called this.) Here's alink about their history. Quite interesting. Take a look.  http://cats.about.com/od/felinegenetics/...|`|xCOnsZf2aa	no but my dog does|`|CGxnLNWOaa	I wish!|`|3arJsZ91aa	My black cat adopted me too.  I didn't realise that she was different until her second vets visit when a new vet pointed it out. (I had no real experience of cats before) I have since looked more closely at other cats paws and think they look weird as they have no thumbs!  Mine has a double claw on one of her thumbs so I guess she has 6 toes on her front left, 7 on her front right and 5 on each back paw.  Perhaps it explains why she is so heavy footed!  She is only about 3kg (7lb), but sounds like an elephant when she jumps off things.|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	sounds kinda cool. my mother in laws old cat is like that too.|`|21cf999bfe54057972e1de48b7cd2cf3aa	She is called polydactyl or is also known known as a Hemmingway cat. Hemmingway, the author,had poly-toed cats and some of the descendants still live on his property. Check out more about these cats on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyl_...|`|XUrgcOMDaa	No, but I wish I did!  She sounds extraordinary!|`|spbqfjvbaa	I don't have one like that, but I would see a few at my job-they're called Polydactyl.  Some cats have it on the front feet only, but I have seen cats who have it on all 4 feet.    I think they're cool.  They look like they have their own mittens on their paws.|`|oEOo9U7iaa	Mutant cat. I'd watch out.|`|cDjWONryaa	They are actually Hemmingway cats originated in Key West Florida  they are all over the place down there.  Look it up online.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyl_...
IzRk1mZQaa	Its perfectly normal.  She is mimicking nursing, or in other words, she's going to her happy place!!  Make sure she doesn't snag up something nice, give her a blanket she can make her own.|`|AA11457471	It's called kneading. Lots of cats do that. It's a comforting thing, like a stress reliever.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	it's called making bread. It reminds the cat of pushing on her mother's stomach while nursing. They enjoy the sensation and often purr when doing it.|`|y7igESfUaa	She's "kneading" it. Kittens will knead at their mother's stomach to stimulate the milk so they can drink. Cats will continue this action as it has a calming effect.    Nothing to worry about. :]|`|V7pXzNKNaa	Yeah, what everyone else said, ha.  Just let her be, she's just having fun.  :-)|`|LQ1Z5AlTaa	This is very common behavior for cats, they do this as kittens when they are feeding off the mother cat and it also gives them comfort so don't worry she is just nestling down for a nap or getting cozy good luck
y7igESfUaa	In this case, I would have to suggest you bring her to the vet. She may have something in her throat and the only way it's going to come out is if the vet has a chance to look at her (and remove it). I understand that you're low on money but that shouldn't be a reason to not get her the attention that she needs. Ask the vet if they offer a financing plan. Many vets will accept payment plans for various procedures if you can't come up with the money up front (I would ask them before, though, just in case your vet doesn't offer that). You could always ask them about how much it will be too. Usually the vet visit alone will cost you around $20-$40. Good luck to you.|`|AA11457471	No one here can help you! TAKE YOUR CAT TO THE VET! (*sigh*)  I'm sure if that's the vet that just spayed your cats he'll let you make payments.|`|LQ1Z5AlTaa	I am so sorry for your poor kitty and I know money is tight at this time but if you have a regular vet that you take your cats to be spayed or neutered they will usually workm something out with you for payments please call and find out this little one needs help now.  Good luck|`|AA11609576	she might have a hairball in her throat, i think you should give her only milk for a day maybe that way it will be easier for her to spit it out.|`|V7pXzNKNaa	I think that it may be a hairball, but if it's been going on for three days, maybe not. Make sure she drinks a lot of water. If you have done everything possible to try helping her and she's not getting better, THEN I would take her to the vet.|`|gU34xa9vaa	It's possibly a hairball.Until you can get her to the vet, try to get her to lick some butter if you have no hairball medicine. That might shift it if it is a hairball, but if not, the sooner you can manage to the vets the better.|`|sFPV2KbBaa	i agree with Totie.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Did this happen right after the vet visit? If so, you should be able to get them in for a RECHECK at NO CHARGE! The only charge should be for any aditional meds or tests. I hear you on the vet bills! I currently have 18 cats (I lost my eldestest to kidney failure a few weeks ago). I'm broke and still running vet bills. Anyway, perhaps the recheck. My guess is it could be something as simple as a "hair ball" and you can get something cheap for that at a pet store. Personally I like adding some "mineral oil" to their food. That can move a hair ball. I guess they can't "poop out" hair balls and they need to come up. Hence the coughing and puking. http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima...
13xTQ5lsaa	Warblers are insect-eaters and will not be attracted to seed.  You could try suet (is that what you mean by cakes?), but without adequate cover nearby, birds may not feel comfortable coming at all.    The sound of water attracts birds better than just the presence of water.  A cheap way to do this is to save a gallon milk jug, take a push pin and make a very small hole in the bottom. Hang the jug over a shallow dish with water (not more than 2 - 3 inches deep - the terra cotta "overflow" plates for house plants work well, and if you add a few bigger rocks as islands - the birds seem to like it better), and fill it with water.  Initially you might get a stream flowing out of the jug - but if the hole is small enough it should quickly slow to a drip.  Some people fill the jug with ice to slow it even further as it drips while it melts.    Where you live and the seed you use will dictate what kind of birds come - finches really like thistle/niger seed, sparrows will eat millet.  To attract a wide variety - straight black-oil sunflower works best (most seed-eaters love it).  Suet can attract chickadees, nuthatches, warblers, and woodpeckers.  Orioles like fresh fruit.  Birds also vary in how they eat - some birds like juncos, white-crowned sparrows, and towhees are ground-feeders and will only eat what is dropped by other birds unless you have a platform feeder or a dish on the ground.    Without cover though, it will still be tough to get a lot of birds in.  Even if you could plant just one decent-sized bush nearby - it would help a lot.    Good luck!    *** Addition *** Do your neighbors have trees?  You could try moving the feeder to an area closer to the neighbor's and use their trees as cover.  That is what my mom does - she doesn't have any trees either, but the feeders are within 20 feet of the neighbor's big pine.  The birds use the pine as cover to check out the area -then fly to her feeders when they feel safe.|`|es8CfccCaa	You must have well fed birds where you live. The only thing that I can suggest is to get a bag of wild bird seed and throw some on the top of your shed for awhile, to attract them.  As far as the bird bath, you don't need to buy one. I'm sure there is a way to trap water in your rock-garden, making a small pond. Even a bowl will do. Try the seed on top of the shed. I thing it will work.  They are fun to watch, but they can be a mess.  Gave it a try.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	You may try hanging the feeder further out from the shed,  making it more noticable, and this way, the birds may be able to see what is approaching them a bit easier.   Also, if the feeder has been hanging there full for a while, make sure the seed is still in good condition.  If it has rained or been humid, the seed can get moldy.   I've had that happen pretty quickly, especially when using those fruity, nutty blends that are made to attract all the "good" birds.  Keep the feeder very clean.  Good luck :-)|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Here are some tips:    Birds need to feel safe from predators and will often hide in bushes and trees.  They are good to keep near all bird feeders.      A water source would be good.  They love the sound of running water.  You can have a bubbling water fountain.  Also, keep out water for the birds to drink.    Warblers are attracted to suet.  They'll also eat black oil sunflower seed.  You can also attract more warblers with breads, fruits, sugar water, and nut pieces.    Don't use chemical pesticides on your lawn.  They aren't safe for any birds.|`|fWf3A3Ioaa	For the most part warblers won't visit feeders - they are primarily insect eaters, not seed.    How long have you had your feeders up, and where are you located?  The lack of protection/shelter in the form of trees/bushes could be a fairly simple explanation as to why they are hesitant - they have no where to hide in order to determine whether the area is safe for them or not.  Although you don't have cats, there are other potential predators around that makes close shelter imperative for birds to be able to get to quickly from feeders.    If you haven't had them up long - give it a week or so, they have to learn its there first, too!
EJpiaCMQaa	I suggest taking binoculars along with your birdbook.  Also, if you know of any birding experts, take them along with you, too.|`|jvYPiZYIaa	well if you've got pictures of them in flight examine the shape's of the wings and sizes and colours.
5pgVIlLFaa	Sounds like your bird may have a genetic problem. This could be a result of inbreeding . Horrible I know but some ppl try and use clutch mates to breed their birds to save a buck and the poor little birds suffer. Good luck|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Sounds like she's kind of a "runt" but healthy, so that's just fine.  She must be so cute!  The girls aren't usually talkers, so don't worry about that.  If you're concerned you can take her to an avian vet for a checkup, but if she's got good energy and is eating well I wouldn't be concerned.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	This sounds perfectly normal. Some birds are just bigger than others, like people. I have a make white white faced 'tiel, and he's as sweet as can be, but he's also the smallest 'tiel I've ever seen. He's healthy and happy though, so I can't complain. Female 'tiels as a rule tend to be much quieter than males-not a bad thing really.

Unfortunatley I cannot remember her name or her companies. However, I saw her at the World Horse Expo at the Timonium Fair Grounds in Maryland. IF you can google the expo you may be able to come up with a list of vendors and consequently come across her name/company.     I'm under the impression that it is very difficult to braid it nicely. I wish you luck, you have far more patience then i do.|`|G8IRX295aa	you could melt the tips together and where the tips are, put the ribbon:]|`|eYo5ELNvaa	Hiya,    i attempted this before christmas, i added all beads and everything. However it frayed a little and didn't look spot on. So, i went onto the web and found this site: http://www.tailendjewellery.co.uk/  I received my bracelet 3 weeks ago and i love it to pieces. Its simple, has my horses name on and isn't frayed at all.    Have a browse, its definitely worth it for a great keep sake.      edit: I also tried superglue but it just went really sharp and hard.  I did make my mum a key chain with her horses hair that worked better, but only because you can hide the hard glued ends with ribbon.    Good luck.
AA11457471	A slight murmur is really not a big deal. Many, many animals live their whole lives with murmurs that cause no problems whatsoever. I have a 17 yr. old cat that's had a murmur her whole life & she's as feisty as a kitten.   A dog with heart problems shows the same symptoms as a person. They will tire easily, be less active, etc.  Your vet is correct in that it should be monitored to make sure it's not getting worse but I think she alarmed you unnecessarily.  Best wishes!|`|GduRpnn0aa	There are many dogs who have heart murmurs and have lived well beyond their expected years. It is great that you are seeking veterinary care on this, but I would take your dog back in when your regular vet is available, for a second opinion.    If your dog does truly have a heart murmur, you should seriously consider giving her Hearty Heart, which is natural support for feline Heart Disease. http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-heart-di...    "Symptoms of Feline Heart Diseasemay include:    Difficult, labored breathing   Reduced energy levels   Persistent coughing   Reduced weight or appetite   Swelling in abdomen   Discolored (blue/gray) gums     If you think your cat is suffering from heart disease, it's a good idea to consult with a veterinarian. It's easy to confuse symptoms of feline heart disease with other conditions.    As with humans, treatments may include medications like:    Diuretics, to control sodium levels and water retention   Vasodilators to lower blood pressure   Digoxin and other drugs to control heartbeat   Natural treatment: Feline Hearty Heart    Hearty Heart for cats contains a special blend of herbs that have been used for centuries to promote circulatory health:    Strengthens a cat's heart   Helps cat resist parasites and disease   Maintains cat's youthful vitality   Excellent for overall health   Safe for long-term use   Hearty Heart can be used alone, or in combination with traditional treatments as part of a total health plan.     You can also help promote a healthy heart in your cat by ensuring she eats well and does not become obese. (Obesity is closely linked to heart and circulatory problems.)     Daily use of Hearty Heart for Cats is highly recommended."|`|OxFsslN8aa	My son who is 10 years old has had a heart murmur since he was born.  He doesn't even know it and nothing slows him down.  A murmur is simply an abnormal extra sound the heart makes when pumping blood.  I have no idea what causes them.  Take the vets advice, and monitor her.  Do not treat her like she is going to die at any minute.
zeTGmB3faa	It is time for a senior vet check. He may be having problems with his gums or teeth, sensitive stomach and perhaps some kidney issues. You certainly have taken excellent care of him since he is 22 years of age. By urging, do you mean gaging or vomiting?  If so, the vet check is very important because he needs to eat to maintain his health. Organs can begin shutting down in three days without food. Best wishes.|`|AA11457471	No one here can help you!   TAKE THE CAT TO THE VET!! (*sigh*)  Even if it's to have the poor old thing euthanized- just don't do nothing!|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	Take him/her to the vet and have him/her checked out to make sure it's not anything serious.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	1/4 tab of pepcid ac can help. Not plain pepcid but pepcid ac    Try feeding anything. Maybe some boiled/broiled chicken breast|`|FkhFIIsjaa	Any time an animal will not eat, there is a 99% chance he/she is ill.    Make an appt. with your vet ASAP, and in the meantime try feeding kitty baby food (meat flavored, like beef), and if that doesn't work, something fishy-smelling like tuna flavored cat food.  Good luck.  *cries for your kitty*|`|lC5NLsZZaa	Is he also having trouble going to the bathroom?    If so, it sounds like he may possibly have a bowel obstruction.     This happened to my kitties when they got older quite often. Cats get very constipated when they get older and have a lot of trouble.    I would definitely go see the vet.     In the mean time, try moist food and possibly Hairball Remedy which works as a laxative for cats. This might help him void the obstruction if its hair and other material that is causing the obstruction.    Bless you and your kitty.|`|xCOnsZf2aa	22 years old?  wow, he/she lived a lot...  mabye its his age|`|oEOo9U7iaa	wow, that's almost as old as Herbert's dog Jessie from Family Guy|`|N7g5QLyOaa	the cat's age is 22 years, not months? I have never heard of a cat lasting that long. I'm amazed it's still alive if that is true. I'd say the cat is way past his/her time, and is in the process of dying. If you have been the owner all that time, I understand it will be sad.. but look at it this way, when you're ready, you get to start over with a new kitty! They're lots of fun.|`|CGxnLNWOaa	BE PREPARE TO SAY GOODBYE AND BE HAPPY FOR ALL GOOD TIMES TOGETHER!
CK2OFqijaa	I can tell your feeling bad about your new dog, but take it from someone who has 4 dogs. You, don't need to feel that your replacing your bf dog. You need to look at it as you have another wonderful little dog to love the dogs will eventually get  along it takes about 3 mos. before everyone feels like they fit. After a while the dogs will actually look forward in having someone else to play with. So don't feel that way I mean if you had a child and then you had another one in doesn't mean you love one more than the other..It's the same thing... So stop crying and start playing with your dogs, let them see you smile and show them some good energy and not bad.. Remember dogs can feel how their masters feel so if your feeling bad then there feeling down as well.. Enough said... Now go enjoy the dog....:-)|`|x1K9OWx9aa	I agree with the first person. Talk to your boyrfriend about having 2 dogs. You never know he might be up to the idea. And you can't force a dog to play with you. Maybe the Crested went through some things that it is afraid that you might repeat the same behavior. So just give the dog some time to come around and talk to your boyfriend about having 2 dogs.|`|Tzijk13waa	I actually went through a similar situation about a month ago when I got my first dog. I was afraid and horribly stressed out about my cat in a similar way that you are stressed about your boyfriend's dog. I just made sure that I reserved special time for both of my pets. I also began working on the bond between my new dog and I by teaching some basic obedience. Keep working with your new addition and use lots of positive reinforcement. You can't force bonds with new animals. They have to happen naturally. Hang in there, I think you'll be surprised at how quickly you will bond with your new one :)|`|GSf09ALBaa	Back up, Natalie and re-group.  You are stressing and feeling guilty for no reason.  The Crested you have will come around.  You need to give him some more time.      I foster.  Every new foster I bring in the door needs an adjustment period.  According  to the dog, it can be a week or 3 months.  My most recent foster has been with me 2 months and just last week she has started playing with toys and chew bones.  She is comfortable in her surroundings and is learning from the other dogs.    So, give her time to get comfortable.  Don't push it and stop the guilt trip.  Your boyfriend's dog obviously feels very good about the attention and affection he is getting and don't try to put too many human emotions on a dog.      I have 9 dogs and I foster.  Some days not every one gets one on one attention.  None of them have any problems with it.|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	i rescued a yorkie-x from the humane society i work at a little over a year ago. i already had 4 bigger dogs. about 9 or 10 months after i adopted the little dog, i adopted another one. i felt guilty and was worried at first, but they get along okay. they are not best friends because the yorkie-x is older, so therefore he doesnt really play with her or anything, but they deal with each other well. plus the yorkie-x still knows he is my baby and favorite of all my dogs, even the dogs ive had longer. i love all my dogs, but the yorkie-x is defintely my fave. its not bad to have a favorite, the dogs dont really know the difference. just try and treat them as much the same as you can, but spend a little extra time w. the dog you have had longer.    edit: as far as the dog playing with you/toys goes. you have had it for only TWO DAYS. he is probably not comfortable in his new surroundings yet and maybe he didnt have toys to play with at his old home, therefore he doesnt know what to do. he may catch on, if not its not a huge deal. my yorkie-x doesnt play with toys and i could care less.  just as long as he is playing and getting along w. the other dog and cats, i would be happy with that. i think you are expecting too much from this poor dog, you have only had it for TWO DAYS.|`|PdotFx4naa	I'm sure you'll all be happy in a few weeks.  As long as your boyfriend is okay with it and the dogs get along you have nothing to worry about.  The Crested will learn how to play eventually but don't rush it.  Let him get comfortable with his new surroundings and be relaxed.|`|ZtMUZ6ryaa	well  if i were you i would keep the dog because when we watch other peoples dog my dogs get very jelous and feel like you are replacing them. but after a while(and it will take some time) the old dog will become friends and love your new dog. you wont feel bad once they start to get along. alos you will confuse the new dog if it keeps switching home. this is what i would do but you should do whatever you want to do......good luck!|`|zSOnXtiQaa	well your questions has many directions but i will start with dogs that are never played with don't know what it is to play with a human. As you bond him can teach him to play with toys and you! If the other dog doesn't seem effected by the new dog and they play together, you shouldn't feel guilty at all! They might enjoy playing with each other, and if they do it would be selfish of you to take the dog back because you want attention from the chihuahua. Lastly, please do not return this dog, only to end up getting another chihuahua and end up in this same situation. Replacing one dog with another will not change your feelings. The chihuahua will still love you and need you! promise =)
hCyt28Meaa	I would get another filter, I recommend the aquaclear power filter, they are cheap and very effective. keep doing the routine water changes, and cut down on the light time. Keep the windows near the tank (If there are any) covered with blinds. Good luck, and happy fish-keeping =]|`|HRHPmjtVaa	Well, it is probably algae in the water (actually bacteria). I had this problem. Do water changes. Also, you said you tried to light, do you mean that it is by a window? Then that is your problem. You should move it. Hope I helped!|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Here's a crazy idea ....ready? ..*clean your tank*.       Take out your fish, put them in a bucket , empty the water, take the rocks , and the plants out, clean it all ..    Then invest in a good filter (make sure its the right kind for your size tank)|`|m0e3a3gWaa	I have been keeping piranhas for 15 years so I am no stranger to algae problems.  I would up your filtration.  With piranhas I would recommend filtration that is 3 times the recommended size for the take.  I know that this can be expensive but piranhas are not cheep.  I would also recommend a UV sterilizer.  Once installing this you will notice a difference in 48hrs.  To battle the high nitrates (that's probably causing your algae Bloom), which will always be an issue with piranhas, I recommend using Pura NitrateLock.  This is a resin which can go directly in your filter.  I have a shoal of 10 Red Bellies in a 250 gallon tank.  I was preforming weekly 50% water changes.  At the end of the week when it was time to change the water my nitrates were at 80-100ppm.  After using the resin I perform weekly changes of 30% and my nitrates do not go above 10ppm!!!|`|1RGsWodYaa	Check the pH level of your fish tank or aquarium to make sure it is an ideal environment for your fish. Although levels vary, a good range is 6.8-7.2. Once you adjust your ph keep your lights off for about three more weeks and everything should be fine. Be sure to avoid overfeeding your fish during this time as the extra nutrients in the water will also affect this problem.|`|IrdZKYT3aa	Green water is from an algae bloom, which you seem to definitely have a serious problem with.  What is your temp?  Try lowering it to about 74 degrees, to help discourage the growth.    And definitely up the water changes to help kill this off.    I'd try doing a 1/4 water change daily, or every other day, and keep scrubbing it off the walls.  What's your water quality?  The algae is living off of excess waste in the tanks water, cut back on this and it should help.  You're on the right track with cutting the light, just make sure the fish don't suffer  being in the dark too long.  How bigs the pleco?  Do you know the kind?  When they get really big, and older, they tend to eat less aalgae  Best of Luck!|`|OsVswissaa	Something is feeding the algae and it's not the light, so that leaves nitrates and nutrients.  Try to keep nitrates under 10ppm.  If you can, add more fast growing live plants like water wisteria.  If you have free floating algae that turns the actual water green, the only way to get rid of it is with a UV sterilizer, you don't have to splurge on an expensive one, if you use it once the algae shouldn't come back.  Algae that grows on surfaces should slow down and go away once you add plants that will compete for food.  Algae controlling products are really very toxic, especially to the pleco, try to avoid it if you can.
Be5O3uk1aa	You could use bitter apple spray on your pony's hair, which will taste bad to the goat but it is also non-toxic.  Or, use a neck cover and tail bag, and blanket as the weather allows.

You need to pin down the goat to the ground, (gently tackle it).  And stare at the goat on the ground until it looks away, the goat will then know it's place in the pack.     It is very important to do this in fron of the pony. The goat will then think it is Bravo, or Omega. ..     This works for me evertime.|`|AA11884446	How about trying to separate them?

You can't dictate how we answer you    Go to a border collie or a poodle rescue and adopt a mix from them    Its not a damn designer dog. It's a mutt will always be a mutt and do your own looking then if you are so dead set on it. DON'T however come crying to us when the dog has behavioral and or genetic problems and said 'breeder' is of no help because their contract protects THEM and not you.    Cross breeding doesn't produce reliable ANYTHING.

Hang out here for the next half hour, there will be several asking for advice on how and when to breed their mutts.|`|OA7cPgGNaa	Darlin', I know you don't care but...    We have enough BYB, wannabe "breeders" and pets dying in Atlanta. We are the WORST state when it comes to animal over population. Not to mention half of our shelters still GAS perfectly adoptable pets. Lets not encourage these people to keep at it.    You will not find a reputable breeder who breeds mutts. Adding the word "DOODLE" or "OODLE" or "POO" does not make it a new breed.    So many dogs get turned in BECAUSE like you said, cross breeding doesn't produce a reliable 50-50 cross. So then, my dear, what DOES it produce? It produces traits people don't like and can't deal with. THUS, people like me end up dealing with them.    There is a gorgeous BC mix at Paulding AC. She is already spayed, micro-chipped, etc and is 9 months old. Gorgeous. I'll most likely be pulling her this week when I can make the trek out there. http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/disp...

And many marvelous mixed breeds that are in shelters that need homes. And "accidental" puppies in irresponsible people's homes.      If a person does not care to get a purebred dog, by all means go for a mixed-breed.     But to want a specific "designer dog" that was purposefully bred, well that is the same mind frame as us who want a specific purebred dog. So why are you telling us we are snobby?     The difference is that we look for discrimination in breeding: proof of health, temperament, soundness and intelligence for companionship and purpose.    And.. to breed a Border Collie to a Poodle...to what purpose would this be done?     If you want a BC, look for a BC. If you want a Poodle, look for a Poodle.    If you want a mix, don't want to go to a shelter, just look in the local papers for mixed breeds.
y8HyP1bzaa	I have three cats, and one that is extremely jealous when the other two get attention.

Dogs like to be around people almost all the time where cats pick and choose when they want to be around people.|`|ldmSmaKqaa	yes cats are nocturnal by nature thats when they do their best hunting and getting in trouble sometimes it can be bothersome just give the cat some toys that are quiet and that should passify him|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	how old is your cat?  how long have you had her?|`|hKjQJNZAaa	cats r nocturnal anyway xx|`|KfkmB4X2aa	Cats are naturally nocturnal. My cat sleeps all day and wakes up around 5 PM and goes back to sleep around 11, so she has partially adapted to a human sleep cycle.    If she runs from you, she's probably just in a weird mood. Sometimes cats freak out for no reason at all.    And if she's only an indoor cat, you might want to consider getting her declawed. It takes about a week to heal and after that cats completely forget that they were declawed. My cat still tries to use the furniture as a scratching post, but she doesn't even have front claws.|`|kW5HfnRnaa	absolutely!  most cats are unless they are played with all day.  just train her on good ways to play with you, playing with people.  taking the time to do this will help in the longrun and you will see a big difference.  she will be around all the time when you have company too!!!!    http://michelescattraining.blogspot.com/|`|32747dcd374c857319720ae0aa088b0faa	Most cats are nocturnal by nature. Most cats also do that with their claws when playing.     Cats are just like people, they all have different personalities. Some days they might want to play all day, while others they just want to sleep in the sun. Cat behavior can't be put into a box as easily as other animals, they all have their own little quirks.
iVQULHqYaa	Everyone will be sick of my solution to this, however I am at it again and it works. I think that you should change to a "grain free diet". I give the same solution time and time again.  I have learnt by my mistakes. My present dog had dreadful problems because of the food which I gave her, I experimented with dog food, I tried raw diets, cooked diets and over the years I tried various dog foods. She did not like the raw diets and the dog food that I gave her resulted in diarrhoea. As an experienced dog owner I introduced any changes gradually. Nevertheless my dog still had problems. She was eight years old before I resolved her problem.   Eventually, because of my researches on the Internet I found that the experts have discovered that GRAIN in our dogs diet causes many problems. I now know that grain creates acidity in the blood. This causes skin problems, digestive issues, allergies, sickness, diarrhoea, anal gland problems etc.,     if your dog has skin problems or any of the above problems PLEASE CHANGE THE DIET. Avoid Grain, rice, beef derivatives and dairy food     I now give my dog a dried food which uses beet for fibre and fish. Its called Fish4Dogs and I buy it on the Internet. Look on the Internet and investigate yourself. Gluten free dog food is not enough to help our dogs, it MUST BE GRAIN FREE.    A rapid change of diet will upset your dog; any change of diet must be done gradually. Do please change to a grain free diet. I have had sixteen dogs throughout the years and they have had various problems. Perhaps if I had known about the dangers of GRAIN they would have had fewer problems. .|`|KxjUim7yaa	Steroids or Bededryl do not solve the problem. They just cover up the symptoms. I was using Eukanuba dog food. I honestly think my dog would have died from eating it. My boy is allergic to all forms of grains. Especially corn and rice. Some dogs have an allergy to chicken, others to beef. Eggs and preservatives are common allergens. I think you dog would benefit from a complete food change. Change the main protein source and go grain free. Our boy had a pretty extensive yeast skin condition. The vet gave us Malaseb shampoo. We saw an improvement in 2 weeks. With a vast improvement at 6 weeks. Check dogfoodanalysis for a top rated grain free food. I make my dogs food, but would use Solid Gold Barking at the Moon if I didn't|`|zSOnXtiQaa	I would say his food would be the thing i would concentrate on. So many dogs are allergic to the food coloring and corn in most dog foods. See if you can find an all natural food with nothing but real ingredients (without corn) or think about a raw diet? Its something to try and if it doesn't work you can move on to something else. Rule out one thing at a time.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Although I don't know what is wrong with your dog, I will tell you about mine.  I had a golden retriever who started to get itchy; little red sores everywhere & then the skin started turning black.  Two local vets looked at him and said he had allergies.  They gave me steroids & antibiotics which I gave to him.  On the meds the itching would lessen but never go away.  I did a lot of research on the internet & found that my dog had an intestinal yeast infection & that the antibiotics actually made it worse.  I treated my dog naturally with AZO yeast (this is for female humans with yeast infections), Acidopholus pills which put good bacteria into her system & olive oil.  I also changed her food to a grain free food.  It took about nine months but he cleared up.      I told you this because vets aren't always right and we shouldn't just accept what they say if it doesn't seem to be working.  The internet is a great place to do research.  I am not saying your vet is wrong.  I am simply saying to get multiple opinions & do your own research.
VSX9tzJaaa	my dogs are the same. some people have told us that it is the cars that are continuously moving and scaring them. there's really no need for the cars to stop or slow down on the highway unless of accidents, heavy traffic, road work, signs, etc. they are fine on the streets because cars aren't going as fast and because there are more signs and lights where we have to slow down or stop. another reason is because dogs get to see more when on the streets than on the highway. so, i think the only way to make your dog more comfortable is to drive on the highway, when and if you have free time, during heavy traffic. you won't be going as fast and will have to slow down or stop occasionally. it would be like a training exercise for your dog to get used to the highway. hope this helps|`|ldmSmaKqaa	patience keep taking him he'll get used to it eventually|`|AA12128656	maybe he doesn't like your driving?    cookies helps everything. feed him cookies. unless, of course, he gets carsick....    do it often for short periods of time. this will help him get used to it.|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	Use side streets when possible.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	My dog used to love to get in the car, then would shake the whole time we were driving.

Most vets do not charge excessively for this.  This is a job for a professional, not an at home thing.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	No   If it is not a blockage you can get some over the counter senekot and give 1/4 tab 2x a day for 2 days   If you want this to stop from happening before it gets real serious then stop feeding dry and feed proper food., The system needs water, dry food dehydrates and a cat which is not normally a drinker cannot drink enough to compensate        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|Ka3fbxszaa	You may want to rule out any other health issues with your vet. Being an older cat, it could simply be constipation or it could mean something else is going on.    I would suggest that you put kitty on canned cat food to increase his water intake. Another great thing is pumpkin. It works for both diarrhea and constipation. I know that the affects are very quick with diarrhea...not so sure about constipation.    If you do try the pumpkin, you can use the canned kind found in the baking section. Make sure it is the plain kind with no other ingredients added.|`|707gOCvbaa	No. Buy the hairball removal from a pet store since it's a laxative. That's too long of a time and he will have problems passing. Canned pumpkin works wonders. I would buy the cat laxative and if he does not poo in another  2 days he needs to see a vet before it turns tragic. good luck.I'm including a link to the item that works.  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...|`|NX4LYXkqaa	Get them soon  treatment  by a doc  only   you don't prescribe|`|AA11945734	Take him to the vet NOW!

You could take your dog to a good groomer and have them remove some of the hair from around the ear and under the ear. This would certainly help in helping the air flow improve.|`|AA12328916	I have a springer spaniel, who has cost me a fortune at the vets, having grass seeds removed. no ointment will stop this, we just have to take care where we walk her, otherwise back to smelly infected ears.

dea4969b45e81e345251fd0f526886f2aa	Okay, we are talking about a good size puppy here - not an 8 week old.    He is not too young to start come.  I train service dogs as well as obedience dogs and they start "come" or the idea of coming to me as soon as they can toddle to me.  I have the dogs solely onto hand signals by 20 weeks for heel, down, sit, stay, stand and come; and start introducing retrieve work around then.      A 3 month old can die under the wheels of a car jsut as easily as an 18 month old.  Do not let him out loose and teach come ASAP.    To get him use to his name, always use his name when talking to him. like "Sam, dinner"  "Sam want to go out"  "Sam, get your toy"  "Sam is a good puppy, Sam is a cutie" -pet, cuddle    Step 1 - go get a leash and collar. Do not take the puppy outside without out. PERIOD.  Get a 6 foot leash.     Step 2 - Go to the hardware store. Get 3 lengths of ? inch to 1/2 inch soft nylon line  20 foot, 50 foot and 100 foot.  Get 3 snaps.   Tie the snaps on one end and make a loop handle on the other.    Start with the 20 foot line.  Use a slip collar that is fitted so there is 3 fingers of space between the dogs neck and the collar or at this age, better yet you probably can just use a flat collar since he isn't big enough to get you off balance or resist you.    Hook the line on his collar.   It would be great if he knew sit and wait - so start working on teaching. (If you don't know how, get thee and him to a puppy class now.).          Put the leash  on the collar.  Step back 3-6 feet. Crouch down, clap your hands,  and in happy, high-pitched voice, say "COME -puppy, puppy, [his name] come,  that's it come" The idea is to coax him and keep reusing his name and come and happy sounds.  Make it sound fun, Make it sound exciting - and if you feel silly, oh well.        You will eventually teach him sit and wait and do a more formal come but lets get him moving.    If he ignores you, keep talking like that but use the leash to reel him in to you. When he gets to you, voluntarily or involuntarily, pets, hugs, tummy rubs and praise.    You DO NOT want to teach your dog that if he comes, he gets food.   Two problems with that. (1) Some day you'll forget the food, he'll come but not get anything and the next time he'll figure why bother, she broke the deal so I don't have to.  (2) What happens the day he decides he would rather chase the rabbit than get the treat? He is off after the rabbit.    You want to establish early on that when you say 'come", he is going to come - whether he wants to or not. Come is NEVER optional.   If he does it on his own when called, he gets petted and praised. If he ignores you, he is going to get hauled in willy-nilly.  Getting dragged in is not comfortable - and while you are dragging (after he knows what come means) you will be scolding him all the way with Come, Don't you dare mister NOW, COME, using a deep voice - make it stern.  His choice - first version or second version.    Right now he doesn't understand that what "come" is or that you think his name means that he should "come" - and that is a bad idea anyhow. Use the word for what you want him to do - come, sit, down (which is not 'sit down" but 'lie down'.)      Once he will always come wiggling over to you - and I have never met any puppy I couldn't get to do that in less than hour or so, you can use all those long lines for greater distance.     When he comes over a distance of 5-6 feet, move back to 10-12 feet using the 20 foot  line and call him.    Repeat this process until he is working on the 100 foot line.    NEVER TAKE HIM OUTSIDE WITHOUT A LEASH (6 ft) OR ONE OF THE LONG LINES.   NEVER TURN HIM LOOSE OFF LEAD AND CALL HIM UNTIL HIM COMES 100% OF THE TIME ON THE 100 FOOT LINE WITH ALL KINDS OF DISTRACTIONS, IE: OTHER DOGS, KIDS PLAYING, TOYS BEING THROWN IN HIS PATH AS HE COMES, ETC.    When you say come and he doesnt, haul his backside into you using the line repeating come, come.    When he gets to you  willingly or unwillingly, praise and pet and make a big fuss and tell he that he is such a good boy. Tummy rubs and scratches work a treat on young puppies    Never ever ever call a dog to you to punish them once they get to you. If you have to make a correction, go to them.  By the way, contrary to the misconception "punishment" is not beating the dog. It can be a verbal scolding in an angry tone, frowning and gettng stiff as you scold or making them do what they were told to do.  It is a correction.    .Clickers are just flat stupid - they are for people who are too dumb to figure out how to quickly say "GOOD DOG" in a happy, excited voice.    You always have your hands and your voice. Use them        Now petsmart does obedience classes - not that great but better than nothing.    Go here to find an all-breed kennel club in your area  for help in finding good obedience classes - even 2 hours or more away, they still would have an idea of who teaches obedience near you:      http://www.akc.org/clubs/search/index.cf...

Training clubs|`|d00bc047d5b2cbd7a719a3772346f4e6aa	We currently have our 4 month old Border Collie in a training class and within a week, with the methods they taught us, I had her turning on a dime EVERY TIME!  It's great!      So here is what you need to get started... lots of small soft treats (many come in good sizes and I cut them down a bit as a little goes a long way and soft treats are much more "desired" than the typical milk bone style) AND a big happy friendly voice--this is really important too.  If someone talked to you in a stern meanish sounding tone, would you want to come?  Probably not :)    A good way to start is to have you and another person working together on this.  You each take a side of a room in your home.  While the pup is doing something else, call his name followed by the command come in a really happy voice.  The second your dog turns in your directions say "yes" and good [insert puppy name here].  When he gets to you reward him with lots of happy praise and a treat.  For men, this can be a little harder as they typically have a deeper, more stern sounding voice, so they will need to work a little more to bring out that higher pitched happy tone.  My hubby is still working on that a bit, but getting better :)  Then have the other person do the same thing.  Do this several times and the puppy will realize that coming means a happy voice and yummy reward.      Keep the training sessions short, like 10 minutes each time, but try to do it a couple of times each day if you can.  After doing this for a few days, it will be easier to get this proper response on your own without the help of a friend.  Now, when your puppy is off doing other things, call his name and the command come, in that happy voice and reward him greatly for doing as you ask with that treat and lots of praise.  After a while, you will find that you can be in another room and call and your puppy will pop right up out of a nap or toy to come to you.  By this time, you should be able to take this to working outside, if not sooner.      Be prepared to use treats for some time, while the puppy is learning.  Being consistent is really important.  My hubby thought that after a couple of weeks, we could eliminate the treats, but our trainer tells us we will need to keep it up for a while to reinforce the come command and then when she's a bit older, we can begin to phase them out and won't need to use them for each time we call her.  But it's still a good idea to do it every 3 or 4 calls (but still always praise well) even when you get to that point so that the dog won't know when the treat will come and will still come with the idea that this time might be the one.    I would also suggest looking for a good puppy course as a good trainer will set you in the right direction.  Since we wanted to persue agility, we got suggestions from the president of the local agility club in our area and we love our trainer and her methods--not stern unless the puppy is doing a behavior that is truly undesirable, such as nipping and biting, otherwise, the happy voice is the way to go and I found to be the best responses from my dog every time!  Just because someone gets paid to train dogs and offers classes, it does not always mean they are good trainers.  You have to do what's comfortable for you and your puppy.  If you find one that doesn't sit right with you, find someone who does.  We did that and we don't regret it one bit :)    Good Luck!|`|8b4c812a2b10723c808bb699bf463bd1aa	call him with treats, when he comes give him the treat|`|AA10714921	u could use some of his favorite toys or treats to attract him for now, but once he learns his name, he should start cuming to u. Tip: u should call him with open arms, and with a happy voice, don't get too frustrated with him and start yelling, for that might scare him, and he will NOT want to come to u! Good Luck!|`|AA12149582	Put him on a leash. To get him to come, say his name and tell him to "come." Gently tug on the leash to get him to you and once he is there give him a treat. You only have 2 seconds to reward for him to connect the reward to the behavior and command combination!    Also, don't forget he is a puppy. He probably knows his name but just doesn't understand you want him to come to you when you say his name. He is a puppy and puppies are like children. They run and run and play and play. Full of energy and sometimes prone to not listen to orders!    Good luck!!|`|afded9a458622afb41f4d09121f0dd5caa	hey it looks like yer havin the same problem i was, funny cuz i put my ouestion on yahoo anwsers to,,, anyway one of the anwsers was reward him!hold a treat in your hand while you call him and sooner or later he will learn he is supposed to come to that name-                   Curlyhairedwonder33                                                      ;-D|`|a2a8210bff8938173985e3f3ef36726caa	give hem a treat when he come to you  and baby hem it takes time for puppy's|`|41e9b6a8008b0c3ec31697437ac62834aa	This worked for me. Take off a sock that you've been wearing all day. When your dog is in the house, throw the sock at her lightly and while the sock is in the air, call her name. If the dog does not turn around, she will when the sock hits her, she will then smell the sock and know that it was you yelling at her. If she does turn to you, then she knows her name and you need to make yourself sound more aggressive when you call her. This trick also helps when training her for other things.|`|915ffbac4bc364441cf2b9b0ff0d5e95aa	First of all,only use the word come.But at the same time use a hand signal each and every time.Never change it at all.Make sure that you teach him in a hallway because he can only go 1 of 2 directions.Take 30 min every day for this lesson and praise him when he does well.DO NOT START GIVING HIM TREATS BECAUSE YOUR NOT ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE TREATS IN YOUR POCKET.Be very patient and don't push him too hard.Make it fun for him.When you have a very stuborn dog sometimes it's a good idea to get a long rope and say come and if he does'nt come give him a slight tug.He will prefer to come to you on his own within time.Have fun|`|81853bb1499c0ba1c3cc5eea0b54c6c6aa	Sit in a circle with your family. Each person should  have treats hidden. Keap his leash on just leave it on the floor and one at a time have someone call him over. Have everyone always use the same expression (come or here and don't change the command. Always say his name first. "Bingo come" "Bingo Sit" good boy bingo...here a treat bingo, When he comes remind him of the command. good boy bingo , bingo come......something like that. Dont use the treat to make him come...use it when he comes. and if he doesnt come keep repeating the command when you pull him towards you with the leash then reward him for comming and remind him of the command. It helps to show him you are boss by laying him on his back for 20 seconds he wont like it but hold him untill he stops struggling. then reward him again. Do the back thing seperately as he will look at it as a punishment but he will get used to you holding him still while your above him.|`|AA10989450	Bribery!

The Come Command in Basic Obedience Class is probably the hardest command to teach.  When your pup is older-6 months, purchase a 50 foot long line (any local pet supply), and attach it to his collar, let it roll out the full 50 feet, hold  on to the long line, and call your dog using a happy, upbeat tone- say (dog name) come, pat your leg if you have to, use treats-but remember it is all in the tone-if you sound happy your dog will be happy to come to you, if your voice is deeper more like an angry voice, your dog will be less likely to respond.  If you are using treats, reward the first couple of time and then alternate.  Good Luck To You.

m0e3a3gWaa	Those water changes can get expensive with all that salt.  I also have a 90 gallon marine tank.  I use this product call Pura NitrateLock.  Its a resin you put directly into your filter.  As long as it is cleaned properly it lasts about 24 months.  Since using this the Nitrate levels in my tank are 0.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Do another big water change. If everything in your tank died, you've got all sorts of nasties in there. Are you getting alot of crud from your skimmer? You can get some plants to help you out-be careful of caulerpa, it can over take a tank. Give it some time-if your live sand is deep, the nitrates will eventually get broken down.  When a system crashes, it takes time for it to recover, or at least repair the damage.  You could set up a refugium if you wished.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	the die off is indeed gonna be bad, you have to figure that every bristle worm asterina star, micro brittle and so on and so on is dead, you can try another large water change and see if that helps, but but i have a feeling you have lots of dead stuff in there that will continue to add nitrates as they decay,     if you can afford it what i would do is, replace the entire sand bed, also change out a good bit of live rock, as much as you can afford this will bring more new detritovours into the tank that will start feeding on the decay,     also run your lights, it might trigger a hair algae/cyano bloom but these things will help consume the excess nitrates and phosphates
D1beU6MPaa	Try this. Make some white rice, minute rice is fine. Boil some chicken and shred it up. Mix it with the rice, nothing else for flavor. If she won't eat out of a bowl, try getting down on the floor with her and hold the bowl for her. I have a Pyrenees that has lymphoma. About three weeks ago he stopped eating and we thought it was time. I made some rice and chicken and my son sat down on the floor with him and held the bowl for him. Much to our surprise, he ate everything in the bowl. Try fixing chicken and rice and see if she will eat it. Good luck|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Take her back to the vet|`|GSf09ALBaa	Get another opinion.  There is certainly something wrong.  It amazes me when I hear these questions.  My vet, when not sure why a dog is in the condition it is in, will seek the advice of other vets and specialists and will also keep the dog at the clinic to monitor it every few minutes and sleep at the clinic until he knows what the problem is and the dog is better.    I cannot imagine anything LESS than the above from a vet.|`|AA10500537	call the vet  because shes a small pup and cant afford to loose  much weight.|`|AA12322387	Be very careful of toys and treats.  Rawhide treats or anything else that isn't easily digestible is a poor choice.      If your dog is literally throwing up everyday, you may want to try a diet of boiled, boneless chicken (no seasoning) and plain white rice for a few days.    This is very bland and good for the dog at the same time.  I would also recommend getting a 2nd opinion.|`|2fb47d9f780ad38758b903b84af1726eaa	she could have gotten something and swallowed it and that would block the stomach. this happen to my st. she couldn't eat and when she did it came back up. she may have cancer. that isn't always detected right away, ask if the calcium levels are high in her blood work, that is a sign of cancer. you could always take her to another vet and get a second opinion. shes young and it would be a sad thing to lose her.|`|nc4SbvfRaa	Go to the vet immediately!|`|iwEpYKlMaa	TAKE YOUR DOG TO THE VET ASAP BEFORE YOUR PUPPY DIES!|`|AA11616934	My mother in law's dog suffers from the same uneasy and upset stomach.Her dog can not eat a lot of different foods because her stomach upsets so easily.

wF52XMxAaa	I'd need more information to say.  But there's lots of information available for you to solve the problem.    The following websites offer some helpful suggestions, but your best resource is Sally Blanchard's book, "The Beak Book" (the full title is, "The Beak Book: Understanding, Preventing, and Solving Aggression and Biting Behaviors in Companion Parrots"). It's out of print, so don't bother looking for it at amazon.com, but it is still available for $19.95 at a number of bird specialty shops. Just google "The Beak Book".    Websites that might be helpful:  http://www.rationalparrot.com/biting.htm...  http://www3.upatsix.com/liz/articles/bit...  http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww12eii...  http://www.parrothouse.com/jh1.html  http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    Avoid any book, website, or training video that promises it will be easy, or says their one magic technique will fix everything. Reputable bird behaviorists may disagree on the value of particular techniques, but anyone promising magic is trying to sell you something.|`|Limt9t5Qaa	A lot of times these birds find it hard o cope with  sudden change, or lack of interaction.

GSf09ALBaa	First of all you are a Rescue Angel and I am very impressed, happy and slightly overwhelmed because we rarely have the opportunity on this site to bask in the light of a person such as you.  The leg will probably need to be re-set.      Bless you!|`|C2U8qR8zaa	Please make sure his leg is completely mended. He may need a doggie brace|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	i am sure he is sweet and you are so kind for rescuing him i am sure the vet will reassure you that everything is ok and i am sure the shelter will have treated him you don't say what breed he is but i am sure he is adorable good luck with him and pick a nice name for him he is so lucky to have such a good owner|`|J9AvKefwaa	I have a rescue dog, I got her when she was 13 weeks old, she'd had her back leg broken. When I got her, the bones had healed, the leg was straight and she had no flexion. I had her leg x-rayed, thinking it could be reset or something. But the bones in both her knee and ankle had been smashed up and broken. She must of been in terrible pain, hobbling about, wt bearing on it whilst it healed because the bones in her joints had all fused together. The vet said there was nothing they could do about it and she ended up having it amputated when she was 4 months old. I am sure your vet will x-ray the leg and then recommend the best source of treatment for your dog. Best of luck.|`|aZ2clyDqaa	Ask the people at these forums. They are experienced with dogs.  Just post it in the animal help and advice section.    http://thelittledogrescue.proboards.com/...|`|AA10421992	If the bone was broken and already has healed the vet will do nothing about it.  Bless you for rescuing the dog.|`|2fb47d9f780ad38758b903b84af1726eaa	Its great to hear that you rescued the dog. If the leg isn't healed all they way chances are they will reset it.

If there is a significant problem with the position of the foot and it is causing him pain, then by all means, insist.     Weigh up the pros and cons, the operation is very painful for the dog. The bone will take 6 weeks to heal, and may need to be plated to heal. The operation will be very expensive and is unlikely to be covered by any insurance.|`|5291a9a99454d23e77cfc29e0c5f7e95aa	the vet will fix it so dint worry good luck to you|`|AA12128656	depends. take him to the vet and have them take a look. if it's very old, they may not want to rebreak it and set it.   since it's probably causing him pain, and is possibly fresh, it's worth a shot to get the xray and see what can be done.|`|QZBGIOygaa	great you saved a dog, my dog is a rescue too.  i would call the vet, it wont cost you noting apart for the phone call.i'm sure if he thinks he needs assistance now, he will see him before saturday.
iXijnCxOaa	It means that the breeder either is no longer allowed to register with AKC or that her dogs were never registered with AKC or that the dogs were sold on limited (nonbreeding) registrations.    Many backyard breeders and puppymills have moved to Continental Kennel Club because they do not want to spend the $$ necessary to do the DNA testing that is required by AKC when an animal is bred multiple times.  They don't want to have to prove that "Jo" (the maltese they own) actually sired the litter and not "Jim" (their maltese/yorkie mix).    It means, at the very least, that your breeder is more concerned about producing pups to sell than producing high quality pups.|`|PM23RDycaa	Unless you purchased your dog from a Candian breed you have a dog registered with Continental Kennel club. This is a scam registry developed for and by backyard breeders and puppy mills. They register mutts for pete's sake.    Honestly you can't even be 100% what you have is a purebred dog. CKC allows a dog to be registered with them as a purebred if he originally didn't have papers based on three pictures and two signatures stating the dog is purebred.    That means a mutt that just happens to look more like one breed than the other could be registered as a pure bred with them|`|3giaPYe8aa	The difference is that you bought your dog from a CRAP breeder.  AKC is a reputable registry that has been around forever.  CKC is a SHAM registry that was "invented" for people that have poor quality dogs.....people that CAN'T register their dogs with AKC.|`|jQglJiMhaa	CKC = Canadian Kennel Club  AKC = American Kennel Club.|`|AA10029366	People only use the ConKC for a few reasons:    1. They are breeding dogs acquired on an AKC Limited registration, which means the breeder they got the dog from didn't think it was good enough quality for breeding.    2. They've been suspended by the AKC for poor breeding practices.    3. They don't want to deal with the AKC's requirements -- i.e. DNA testing frequently used sires, kennel inspections for high volume breeders, etc.    So they go to the ConKC, a for-profit club founded by puppymillers who don't ask questions, don't inspect kennels, and don't care about breeding practices.|`|Chxoncy7aa	CKC is for puppy mill dogs and byb's.  AKC is not!  Unless you are talking about the Candian Kennel Club, which I doubt.|`|vPde97E2aa	Sure wish folks could figure out how to use that NIFTY *SEARCH BOX* up top of the page,so we didn't have to answer this ***16*** times a day!!    CKC =CON KRAP CLUB=is the PUPPYMILLING CROOKS SCAM to screw SUCKERS into buying CRAP!!!    AKC is the only reputable registry in the US!|`|qgeI6Chxaa	The CKC is the Continental Kennel Club, which is a bogus registry. Any breeder who uses the CKC is a backyard breeder, and the papers are worthless. The AKC is the only legitimate registry in America.  CKC could also mean Candian KC, which is a good one, but if you bought a dog in the US it probably isn't CanKC registered.|`|ZkYxdlTeaa	If that means Continental Kennel Club, then there is a problem with the breeder, I would avoid anyone that is now breeding CKC dogs instead of AKC.  Something happened, they may have been banned from AKC.    The only legit CKC is the Canadian Kennel Club|`|yEUo24Znaa	What it probably means in this case is that she bred the maximum allowed litters from her btch and can no longer AKC register them so must use CKC to make money on them via unsuspecting people like you!  That or she has been suspended, or has complaints etc through AKC and has been barred from registering dogs.... Look her up on AKC website and see if you can find her. In all, she is a BYB breeding for quantity not quality, and you need to alter your dog.
lWuUMY7Naa	Hi, too much protein is bad for rabbits, They should only get large amounts of fiber per day.    I believe it may be 10 grams, but not 100% sure.    Hope I helped!    ~bob~|`|m5j0g5A3aa	i dont know... sorry. maybe veggies only. you can try giving it peanut butter|`|hte5uUpHaa	Only if you're going to bake them|`|E5dvDOviaa	I have a rabbit and he is really healthy so i will tell you his menu!:    !. Normal rabbit food(he is very picky,he doesnt like pelets so i feed  him the rabbit food with the colourful stuff in it)    2.Carrots-a small amount about 4 or 5 times a week    3.Dandeline leafs-not too often-your bunny may get the runs!    4.grass    5.salad leaves-from the salad bags you can buy in the supermarket!    6.Bunny treats-Raviolous and the fried carrot sticks    thats about it!|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Most foods animals eat have the appropriate amount of protein for their species.  Rabbits are light-boned and weigh half of what the same size cat weighs.  Protein builds muscle mass and feeds brain cells - humans need a lot of it.  We get protein from vegetables and meat.  A cat needs only meat protein for its needs.    The most important issue for rabbit health is fiber which they get from their hay.  A small amount of greens every day has protein sufficient for a rabbit.  For a rabbit's health chewing is very important to regulate tooth growth.  There is not a lot of protein in hay and it is sufficient for a rabbit.  Elephants are the same - they require large amounts of vegetation for their diet.   As amatter of fact I think I read somewhere that from an evolutionary standpoint rabbits and elephants are surprisingly closely related.|`|xcRqjQGHaa	Their pellets will generally have all the protein they need. An adult diet is pretty simple. 1-2 cups of fresh vegetables, unlimited grass hay, a tablespoon of fresh fruit, and 1/8 of a cup of pellets per 5 pounds. Pellets should be without the fruit/cereal extras in it.
lWuUMY7Naa	Hi, Each 5 pounds a rabbit should get 1 1/2 cup per day. So around    3 1/2 cups a day for your rabbit.    Please don't give them Unlimited food, will get over weight.    Hope I helped!    ~bob~|`|8yDnCCm9aa	Rabbits should get HALF a cup per 5 lbs, not 1.5!    Unlimited timothy hay    Veggies every day such as carrots, mustard greens, basil stalks, or broccoli stalks.|`|AA12106440	For my rabbits, I feed roughly one ounce of pellets per pound of body weight-although my larger rabbits tend to eat less per pound than my smaller ones do.    You can use the one ounce per pound as a guideline, though, and just watch your rabbit's body condition. If he's getting a little flabby, cut back. Too thin? Increase the amount by an ounce or two.|`|5M57TTfpaa	the first person that answered... that is alot of food!! they would get fat off of that.    my rabbit is 11 pounds and she eats a cup a day. she also eats timothy hay, as alfalfa is pretty fatty.

They have nostrils to breeth through (I'v seen them)!|`|e4555ee0a54f77a418944e766425f0b0aa	Well yes as a matter of fact Some turtles can carry out the act of respiration through there anus.    It is easier than you think as during there winter hibernation period they sleep under water and the water is frozen over so they cannot come up for air any ways so they evolved a way around it. The capillaries in and around there cloacal vent are tightly packed and very close to the skin so the act of respiration  ( i.e. Gas exchange) Can and does happen through the Booty!|`|AA11901826	Yes, but only when they wanna talk s**t about their owner.
c09a06c322421eb8da707eee5d89a5adaa	I am a veterinary student and I apologize if this answer is pretty vague, but without seeing your cat, it's really hard to tell anything.  Things that can cause a lump in amy part of the body... can be a cyst which is basically a pouch that oils and wahtnot that usually are secreted outside, are secreted INSIDE the pouch..  It could be a hematoma, which is just like a bruise, a little blood that somehow wound up there.  It could be an abscess, which is a pouch of pus, possibly from a bite; however, since it is not painful, i would lean away from that.  Now onto some more unpleasant things, I again say that it is impossible to say what it could be on the internet, but these things would come on my differential list.  It is possible that it is a tumor of some sort.  There is a type of tumor that cats get in response to a vaccine.  There are compounds used in vaccines to make them more potent, called adjuvants, which in 1 in 25,000 cats has shown to develop into something called a Vaccine Associated Fibrosarcoma.  There are also other types of tumors that can pop-up, some benign, some not.    My recommendation is not to worry too much (lol, i know the feeling of staying up all night with my pet because I spotted something strange), call your vet and schedule an appointment.  He/She may recommend performing a Cytology on the mass.  This is where a few cells from the mass are aspirated with a needle and put onto a slide. It is then either read in the hospital or sent to a lab, and this tell you, with about 70% accuracy, what it is.   Also, with kitty being 11 years old, the vet may want to run normal bloodwork just to make sure that everything else is doing ok.    Keep us updated on what happens!|`|153f71eec51a6d1868bd20db8fd99940aa	It could be an abcess.  Get to the vet SOON.|`|AA11306754	take her to a vet|`|f05750d41e1216b3a87ed9bcdbc0e90caa	Could it be where she would receive vaccines?  It could be anything.  From sarcoma to lipoma.  Your vet should be able to take a sample of it and submit for further evaluation.|`|f5f6889b09f312fd7ca537b7507b0a1eaa	I don't know what it could be.  It doesn't sound like it could be anything good, and with anything lump like my mind leaps to cancer.    Take your cat to the vet.  Call and see if you can set up an appointment for Monday.  Vets usually have answering services or answering machines.  Leave a message to be called back right away.    I wouldn't touch the lump any more and for your cat's sake STOP SQUEEZING IT!!!

As long as Murphy is eating, drinking water, having normal eliminations consider contacting your vet first thing Monday to arrange for an appointment to have it looked at and evaluated for further follow up.  Since her personality has changed a little this could be an indication as well that she isn't feeling herself as well.
AA11668420	Well Elmira, first of all spend some time thinking about how it would feel to be held against your will and squeezed until your lungs hurt and having your skin rubbed raw and not being able to do a thing about it.  Then think about if all this were happening and you did not understand why this was happening or what you did to deserve this.

Thank you for not de-clawing.|`|AA11430622	i use them, they are called soft claws. they are great and i don't even think my cat notices. everything you need to know about them is here:    www.softclaws.com     and they come in fun colors that make it fun for use and look really cute.|`|041e0f022b171778c8b04b259b615767aa	Depriving your cat of the functionality of its claws is like being a mountaineer and getting your fingers removed. Think of it. What the "nails" are to your cat is much more than your nails are to you. It's your cats fingers and hands. A human mountaineer would to fine without his nails, but not a climbing cat. Talk to you vet about your problem. The solution is in telling your cat where not to scratch or sharpen its claws, and get yourself a scratching post.|`|AA10841848	Please DON'T use these.  They work for the first few weeks, but after that, they start to grow out. Our cat was a scratcher and when she tried to scratch a chair, she got caught. The following day, she got caught in the carpet.  If we had not been there, who knows what would have happened.  We ended up having her de-clawed anyway.  I feel that declawing saved our relationship with her.  After a week or so, she was just fine and is very happy and healthy member of the family.    If you can find a way to get the softpaws off of the cat, then they might work.  I could have the cat that is the exception to the rule!!   Just think of them as the same type of fake fingernails we use and what a pain it is to have them filled every few weeks or having them taken off and put on again.  I feel the pain we put Kaci thru for the surgery was alot less replacing the nails each month.    Hope that helps!!!|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	http://www.softclaws.com/|`|fde78b0521e5dcf226ed3e07da7c3428aa	no there r fake

Die ganzen Unterwasseraufnahmen sind zwar alle wundersch?n bunt, doch dies liegt alles nur an der knstlichen Beleuchtung. Ab einer Tiefe von 3 - 10 m gibt es keine Farben mehr. Wer schon mal selber tauchen war, wei?, dass eigentlich alles unter Wasser grau ist. Deswegen ist es absolut sinnlos fr Unterwasserbewohner Farbrezeptoren (Z?pfchen) auszubilden.

9bd4a4b095a01f7d671d1a3e42ea96dbaa	First of all the mustang! I haven't read your updated version yet but I will after I write this and will edit as needed.    I have been training horses all my life, and I am also a Equine Veterinary Technician.     Mustangs are generally very hard to train, they can be, it is possible but it is very hard work. But it is also work that is very rewarding when accomplished. Mustangs have more of the natural instincts than most human bred breeds, mainly because the mustang is a wild horse. The response to surroundings may effect them more than a....lets say arabian. A horse is a flight not fight creature, but when flight doesn't get him away he will not hesitate to fight, that includes rearing and striking, kicking, charging, biting....well almost anything he can think of doing to get away he will do.     The mustang should be handled much more differently than your human mastered horses like the arabian. You need to respect his "terms of agreement" unlike our quarter horses who respect ours. Please do not be harsh with this animal because he can be harsher.     Here are some steps I would take in your position.    1. Watch- Watch him, learn his reactions to everything from the wind blowing, to fly's buzzing around his hind legs, see if he is highly irritable to certain part of his body which I suspect he will be, especially his head, and flank areas.    2. Evaluate- When he does have a reaction to something that upsets him, see what it is, does he rear and strike, does he kick, does he charge, that way when you approach him you are able to know what he will most likely do in order to get away from you.    3. Tempt- Tempt him with changing surroundings, different noises, colors, sights, and so forth. He may be used to grass and trees and darkness, but may react to other objects that immitate those things.    I would start with those 3 things, but if he is totally wild, I would start by just comforting him, and letting him no you don't mean harm, but yet you mean business.    ALWAYS AND ALWAYS think safety, wear a helmet when your with him at all times, if he strikes your head will be safe, if he runs you over, your head will be safe. Take all safety precautions. If I could Id wear football gear lol :).    Im now going to read your updates.    I read your additional details, and as far as your mother in law goes....she has no say in what you do with the horse if you do decide to buy him. It's the law, and if she doesn't like it, tell her to take it up with the county sheriff, and if she doesn't make it clear that you will. Sometimes you need to stand up for yourself wether you do it nicely or by being rude.    As far as being partially wild.....He isn't. A horse remembers what he is trained to do no matter how long he sits in the pasture. Horses like to be horses, and hate to be worked or ridden, but they know what they were taught.    All he needs is a few reminders on horsey manners, and a few round penning sessions should take care of that.     I hope I helped. :) If you have any questions let me know, feel free to message me!|`|AA11162050	Difficult even for an expert.  You can get yourself mangled or killed.|`|357462860d6e55f94f178b5c15352f0eaa	i think they are hard to train because the first thing you have to do is earn the horse's trust, they are really skittish at first.|`|2e040ee8d20979ba052108c984af80edaa	Hard because they are used to being wild.    Coach|`|c3d220cabbc32f1d84c682c54f03b361aa	I have never worked with a mustang but i think it would be a good challenge. They are not mean just scared. You have to be careful around them because they have no respect for you until you teach it to them. Another thing I know about taming wild mustangs is that they very rarely buck when you first ride them. If you do decide to try a wild mustang look into Parelli's methods. He teaches all natural ways. He can train any horse and teach you to train your own. Try www.parelli.com|`|c939b935f8a82833428d4c8fc13e9cd6aa	ok, i personally have never trained a mustang, but i've helped trained a stallion and i know people who train Mustangs.   They, like any horse, are VERY skittish and everything you introduce them to is new so do it SLOWLY.  Since the horse you (might???) be (are?) getting is about (?) 8 it will be harder to train , but if you take things slow and don't lose your temper, then you should be able to train.    ADVICE: go to a TRUSTED, professional trainer that knows what they are doing, there are great trainers out there, and they might be expensive...but if your getting into horses, well, that's an expensive hobby WITHOUT mustangs...    GOOD LUCK!!!

They rely on the person for directions, and only serve to keep the person safe on the way there.

AA12245430	Constant supervision, You have to catch your puppy having accidents in the house and use a firm tone in your voice, say no and take the puppy outside watching until it goes potty, then praise after it goes outside.

In the morning you bring the pup right from the crate to outside potty right away. .Try to make sure it is the same time every morning. Play with your puppy outside and give lots of praise for good deed done. Then give your pup som food and water,(never with-hold water even when crated}, and after about a half an hour,run him out again. Again praise for good deed done. after a few hours awake put pup down for nap. after about an hour or after he wakes up do the ritual again. It is also a good idea to have newspaper by the door and if he has a wee accident anywhere else but, use the newspaper to soak it up because then it will smell like his wee and he'll have more of a tendancy to use the paper.. That will also train him to go to the door. after a while start putting the paper more and more out the door till you have all the paper out the door. and he'll naturally start waiting to go out the door. these are two different techniqus you can use at once. In a couple of weeks he should be fully trained. Another good thing to do if you have a fenced in yard is to teach the dog to come when you flash on and off the porch light. I would call my dogs while I flashed the porch light and after a while I would just flash the porch light without calling them and they would come running.|`|66d589797dfac976eacf6e0ed249803daa	well when his peaness stiks out ya|`|878aefa7af3422f6ea0ed1ece18a22ffaa	I have a one year old westie and it took her a long time to learn too.

If you work all day, you may want to buy a "Puppy Pad" to put in your kitchen or bathroom.    Without a pad, there is 2 simple steps:    1. Scold him [make sure it is right after he "went"]  2. Pick him up, set him outside, and see if he has to take the rest of his pee. Even if he doesn't make him stand out there for about 3 minutes, because that teaches him he will go outside either way, making a mistake, or not.     Happy Holidays! :-]|`|f69c887b45fadf454d2d4e261ae7bc7caa	Get a cage , dogs will not go pea or poo where they sleep.    You keep him/her in the cage at all times for about the next three weeks only letting them outside to pee or poo them straight back in the cage, Thsi reinforces the training to go outside.     If they have an accident  then you can use adversion therapy by grabbing they snout and rubbing it in the pee spot if they went in the house, some people think this is creul but i have used it with great sucess.!

c6ce8d89947389d617cfb613e48d07afaa	She is trying to protect you it sounds like.  You should show her that when someone comes in the house, it is ok and she doesn't need to bark anymore.  I think that it is a good thing that she warns you, but once that person is in the house, go over to that person with her and show her that they are ok to be there.  I even use the words "it's ok" to my dog and he has learned to stop barking when people come in.  You just have to be repetitious and do it when anyone comes in.  Have the person pet her while you are right there next to both of them and calm her down that way.  By taking her into the next room, you are not showing her that person is ok to be there.  Hope this is helpful as this works for my choc. lab.  He is one now, and such a good dog.  It just takes time and patience.  Good luck!|`|0d1b5fcc305ead0ef5c939b96424f4b2aa	Some dogs are just yappers. I would suggest ignoring the dog. Like when it starts barking you just sit there and pretend like you don't hear it. Odds are the dog will find this curious and try to get attention out of you and if you pretend like it isn't there it will confuse it till it stops barking. Once it does this you can start playing with it again. I dunno, that's what works for my dog. Hope it helps.|`|e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	There are a few ways to work through this, but they certainly don't involve the reinforcement you're showing her!    If you continue to devote total attention to her when she barks, she's going to continue to bark. She's learned that it gets your total focus and love.    If you don't want a bark "shock" collar, consider one that triggers a citronella spray when she barks. You can also squirt her with water from a squirt bottle.    The best might be to practice for about 15 minutes every day. Sit her calmly and have someone come to the door. Scold her when she barks, but that's it. Then sit her again and praise her when she's quiet.    It will take some time, but it's basic tried-and-true dog training.

Explica??es envolvendo a ocorrncia de golfinhos para a gua salgada e dos botos para a gua doce s?o as mais comuns. Entretanto, n?o existem diferen?as anat?micas para separar golfinhos de botos, pois este  um problema de terminologia regional e n?o de anatomia ou fisiologia. Em um pas de grandes dimens?es territoriais como o Brasil,  comum que alguns termos ganhem for?a de uso em determinadas regi?es e, com o tempo, passem a reverenciar um objeto, animal ou planta que, em outras regi?es do pas, s?o referidos com outro(s) termo(s). Os exemplos mais fceis de lembrarmos s?o os semforos de transito, tambm chamados de faris ou sinais ou sinaleiras; a mandioca tpica de muitos pratos da famlia brasileira, tambm chamada de macaxeira ou de aipim; e a mexerica, tambm conhecida como tangerina ou bergamota. O mesmo ocorre com os termos golfinho e boto. Neste ltimo caso, tradicionalmente procura-se seguir as comunidades cai?aras. Ao longo da costa brasileira  comum que pescadores chamem de "botos" os animais semelhantes aos golfinhos que tradicionalmente conhecemos, e que s?o encontrados apenas nas proximidades da costa. Aqueles que s?o encontrados em guas afastadas da costa s?o chamados de "golfinhos". O mais curioso nisso tudo  que os pescadores conseguem distinguir as diferentes espcies de golfinhos da costa brasileira pelo local onde elas podem ser encontradas. Por exemplo, o boto-cinza ou tucuxi marinho (Sotalia fluviatilis) pode ser encontrado desde Santa Catarina at o Amap, ao longo de praticamente todo o litoral brasileiro. Como s?o encontrados prximos  costa, s?o chamados de botos. O golfinho-nariz-de-garrafa (Tursiops truncatus), o famoso Flipper do seriado de TV, tem distribui??o em guas costeiras de Santa Catarina ao Rio Grande do Sul. Nessas regi?es o golfinho-nariz-de-garrafa  chamado de boto. Por outro lado, a partir de Santa Catarina, at o nordeste brasileiro, esta espcie ocupa guas mais afastadas da costa. Nestas outras regi?es,  conhecido como golfinho ou caldeir?o, em fun??o de sua colora??o cinza-escura. Portanto,  comum seguirmos esta padroniza??o de terminologia cai?ara.|`|656e5a6e32d3c5f51fd1b7120d6b34e2aa	Os botos s?o cetceos de gua doce, enquanto os golfinhos s?o marinhos!|`|0772607ffdff89481fdcc3140b485b99aa	Nenhuma.

a43be2e5e684befa05663b3930543e45aa	Has your dog ever seen a vet?  I'm not being sarcastic... I'm just curious if you have ever had vet care for your dog.  My vets that I work with have never had a dog with an eye infection that they couldn't cure.      Now... that being said... if it is more than an eye infection like dry eye (not producing enough tears - the dogs eyes get all full of thick greenish goop, looks like an infection, but isn't), or like eyelashes growing out of the inside of the eyelid, or an eyelid rolling in and the hair rubbing on the  cornea... these situations are different than just an eye infection.      Dry eye needs special medication and periodic testing for the rest of the dog's life.  The other problems I mentioned are surgical problems... yes, surgery could be expensive... but if the surgery could CURE the problem...your dog would be greatful and you'd be money ahead.    If you've already seen a "regular" vet and aren't getting anywhere... either ask for a referral to a veterinary ophthalmologist (eye specialist) or find a specialist that doesn't need a referral.  If you've been doctoring with this same problem for 5 years, it's time to see a specialist.  Yes, that will cost more, but if they can cure it, go for it!|`|619dc8630ccfea7a3d2c55baae5fc84eaa	GOVT VET HOSPITAL KG ROAD|`|60d638adb7d9f4a7086caa24a31392aaaa	you can contact  MR.KIRAN CHITNIS  (CHITNIS HOUSE) 156, DWARAKAPURI COLONY  PANJAGUTA  HYDERABAD 500 082.

Make sure the dog goes out immediately before going to bed. Keep the dog in a much smaller area, such as a kennel or crate since animals will not foul their immediate living area.

I am not kidding I and the same problem although mine just jumped through my glass windows. he was 6 when this started happening. Is he fixed? I would suggest only because I had no other choice to put he on some doggy downers called be calm. There are no tranquilizers in these. I took mine to the vet and that is what he wanted me to do HE Did not want me to Neuter him because of his age and the health probles of getting an older dog fixed. It did work.

e70e42429c333fa029abdbcdae37f2a2aa	First thing to do is try to protect her from scratching. A compress bandage wound around her will usually do the trick if you keep a close eye on her.    Now, as to the itching itself. Can you find a bite of some sort? She may have been bitten by something she's reacting to.    If you run your hands over her, do they itch as well? Such as poison ivy or sumac? If you try this, DON'T touch anything else until you remove the oils from your hands.    Is there evidence of mites or fleas?    Have you tried Benadryl? It may be more effective than the antihistamine that your vet prescribed.    Try bathing the dog with a non-reactive soap or anti-itch foam such as Veterinarian's Best Flake and Itch Relief, or rubbing the raw spots with vitamin E oil.    If it's mites, or a more difficult diagnosis, your vet can prescribe steriods to help until things calm down.|`|AA10197119	my dog went in for surgery for her ear and i know it seems really different but she kept trying to itch her ears so they gave us a pill that calms her down so she wont scratch so much it doesn't hurt her at all u also might want to try aloevera it stops the burn for people it could stop her from itching to and since its a plant it wont hurt your dog|`|808ab7d8812c02b8869d11debfd22580aa	it could be any shampoos you may have used he could have allergy's|`|AA12114758	Perhaps your pup has dry skin.

The best thing that i can tell you is that you need to get some baby shampoo or some dog shampoo for sensitive skin and bathe her in warm water.  Make sure she is dry.

Sometimes its bad other times bearable.  The vets have tried a number of things such as antihistamine (didn't work), prednisone (works for a short while), dust mite medicine (didn't work), and food change (didn't completely work).  We are getting ready to do a skin test to find out exactly what her problems are.  I wouldn't suggest the prednisone (I hope I'm spelling this right).  It's a steriod and it really messed with my dogs personality.  She ground her teeth a lot, became very dazed, and lost control of her bladder often and it only worked while she was on it.  The vets think she has combination air borne allergies and food allergies.  Here's what I have figured out.  She is allergic to beef and chicken which most dogs with allergies are and most dog food and treats contain them.  In combination to the food allergies she has air borne allergies all year long.  For the food allergies I have tried many brands and found one that seems to work well for her (she only itches a little bit now).  The brand is called "Wellness" and I use the duck formula.  It is for sensitive skin dogs.  It's expensive but she has responded really well to it.  As for the air allergies I haven't figured it out yet.   I hope this helps.  Symptoms my dog has had:  Belly rash, cronic ear infections, goopy eyes, itchy paws, and itchy genitals.  All of these are associated with skin allergies which can come from different seasons, different foods, different shampoos, even different animals.  By the way, we also shampoo her with medicated shampoo that you can purchase at the vet clinic.  The "Wellness" dog food can be purchase at animal specialty store, i.e. petsmart.
