I need to place a cat but want, if possible, to follow its progress or AT LEAST to feel confident that they won't kill it. I'm wondering if some of these "pet rescue" places are better than the shelters. I'd like a place, if possible, that will let us know if the cat is not being placed and before it is ever put to sleep, so we could move it in order to avoid that. Any ideas? We need to place this cat SOON. :( We are in the San Jacinto/Hemet area in Riverside County, California.
