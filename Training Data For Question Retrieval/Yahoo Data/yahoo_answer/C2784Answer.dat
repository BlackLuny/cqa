It makes your waistband bulge, then gives you the running shitz!|`|qvW5ZYruaa	Hmmmm <br>  *dribble dribble*<br>  <br>  Fish 'n Bob mit Ketchup sounds nice.

Inside, luxurious furnishings in a series of rooms only add to the feeling that this might not be a restaurant at all, but perhaps a mansion belonging to some aristocratic gourmand who happens to enjoy 24-month gran reserve prosciutto, handmade orechiette with sausage, grilled free-range veal chops, and nice bottles of Italian wine whenever the mood strikes.<br>  <br>  Yes, this place is pure fantasy fodder, but luckily folks with a taste for artisanal cheeses, fresh pasta, local produce, and premium meats can live the dream, too â€”|`|AA9ARFN3aa	Applebees those all you can eat ribs are so good.

Some there are more too but then again, they offer Prime Rib so at least you get your moneys worth.
n20KiADxaa	To keep it simple. Fast food = death.<br>  <br>  However if burgers are cooked all the way through they are fine. Most ecoli cases are from hamburgers/ ground meat. The bacteria (from the feces of the cow)that is outside the meat gets mixed up with the rest of it. This results in the bacteria betting inside the burger patty. Fast food joints always cook their food to well done anyway.<br>  <br>  Fast food will kill in another way. Obesity/ Heart Attacks/ High Blood Pressure/ etc|`|hmAERNPAaa	It really depends on the fast food place.  Some better quality ones such as: (Mc. Donalds and In-n-Out) have put a lot of effort into making their food better quality.  Especially Mc. D. These places know that they get a lot of attention for their food and therefore have to make sure that it's all safe and healthy.  They will inspect their meat and such.    <br>  <br>  Some though aren't has good and don't put much effort into doing so.  But these things won't kill you.  The restaurants wouldn't serve you something that could potentially kill you.  The worst would be getting sick but that could be avoided by making good choices on what fast food places you go to. <br>  <br>  The meat sold in stores have to go through a grading process in which they are tested and inspected thoroughly.  This is the safest meat you can get out there if you're really concerned.  <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to go to fast food places though.  Sometimes our body needs and craves the unhealthiness that those foods contain.  But the safest option is always to get it from the grocery store and make it yourself.|`|EkamSEW2aa	my dad owns a coffee shop that serves food and of course coffee.but i always go to the kitchen and my the chef is very clean he washs is hands and if anything drops on the ground he throws it away.but the meat he uses is clean and whenever he fryes things he changes the oil after couple of days.i also know some one who owns a mcdonalds and i dont think there chicken is pure.places such as mcdonalds,burgerking,hardees,and stuff like that you dont know what to expect in the food.subways is a great choice|`|Cbhog8RYaa	Fast food is disgusting.|`|teeQmWsBaa	Too many of us consume and it shows.

We have many people from farm help to waitresses who are from 3rd world countries and have never had inoculations. A decade ago the average person may have a few to hundreds of internal parasites. Today it can be a few to tens of thousands. So much for open borders.<br>  <br>  Edit: McDonalds uses meat from foreign countries that is not U.S.D.A. approved. If animals are unhealthy is there meat unhealthy?|`|VPksp6SQaa	Is Fast Food Healthy? As in won't clog your arteries, you could eat it every day and not get sick, and won't get fat? NO!!!!<br>  But, for your bacteria answer...i think it all depends on who is working. I believe that the meat is fine 99% of the time....but the workers have to wash their hands constantly, make sure they prepare the food correctly, don't leave meat out over a period of time...so I think if anybody wants to blame the fast food industry, they should really look into the workers...<br>  I think that the food sold in stores is perfectly fine.....of course you'll get the rare sick to your stomach caused by food poisioning, but that happens everywhere (not just fast food restaraunts....high class places have those types of problems too)|`|vnYYH4fMaa	I don't think its healthy.

For appetizers they sell interesting ones like Jack Daniel's chicken strips which are chicken strips with a very thick breading tossed in a sweet sauce actually made from Jack Daniel's. It's a very popular appetizer and TGI Friday's capitilizes off of the popularity of the Jack Daniel's glaze. Other popular appetizers are fried green beans with a wasabi ranch dipping sauce, fried mac n cheese which is delicious, and parmesan crusted quasidillas. They also sell the basics like wings, boneless wings, spinach dip, mozzerella sticks, and potato skins.<br>  <br>  For entrees they sell fajitas, burgers, specialty salads, chicken platters, sandwiches, pasta, ribs, etc.<br>  <br>  For dessert they have a brownie obsession which is a hot brownie with vanilla ice cream, carmel and chocolate sauce, and pecans.

They check very carefully, it doesn't matter if you look 21.|`|a3ZZkY08aa	those types of bars/clubs check ID VERY well!! b/c they are big name locations in Chicago and if they are caught with minors in their establishment they will lose their liquor license and a LOT of people will be mad...|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	I don't know about that specific bars.  But many bars will just look at it and glance at you to check.  The main thing people that get caught with fakes/other IDs is them being paranoid.  Trust me, when you actually have to use it it's alot more nerve racking than you expect.  The more confident they are the less likely they'll be compelled to black light or scan it.|`|akvrwpywaa	Not well enough.  You're basically a criminal.  In the state I'm in, it is a felony to possess an ID that is not yours.
