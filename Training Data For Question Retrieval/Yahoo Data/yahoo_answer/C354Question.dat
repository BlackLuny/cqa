If it was your job to protect someone, and you took an oath that you'd do anything to protect that person and you get paid for it and one day a shooter points their gun towards who you're protecting, would you take the bullet for the person? btw the person you're protecting is NOT a family member or close friend. Just your boss.      The president's secret service are paid to protect the president at any  cost, even if it means taking a bullet for him. So the men are highly trained with their military or whatever backgrounds. President obama is under attack with random shooting coming from nobody knows where. The job of the secret service is to protect obama even if it means takin a bullet.       Does this mean that if a person pays someone enough money that they'll die for them?

20090130152544AAarcUF	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Survey: Post the lyrics to the last song that truly spoke to you?	There once was a poodle who thought he was a cowboy,    but he lived in a cage the size of his thumb.    And, though his white horse was a box of toothpicks,    he galloped around until hit by a car.    Sometimes I flap my arms like a hummingbird    just to remind myself I'll never fly.    Sometimes I burn my arms with cigarettes    just to pretend I won't scream when I die.    Sometimes I can't wait to come down with cancer.    At least then I'll get to watch tv all day.    And on my deathbed I'll get all the answers    even if all my questions are taken away.   If my life was as long as the moon's,    I'd still be jealous of the sun.    If my life lasted only one day,    I'd still be drunk by noon.      -The Handsome Family, Drunk By Noon

20061120203437AAFCrff	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Another joke, Silencing curse?	Once upon a time there was a Prince who, through no   fault of his own was cast under a spell by an evil witch.   The curse was that the Prince could speak only one   word each year. However, he could save up the words   so that if he did not speak for a whole year, then the   following year he was allowed to speak two words. (This   was before the time of letter writing or sign language.)      One day he met a beautiful princess (ruby lips, golden   hair, sapphire eyes,) and fell madly in love. With the   greatest difficulty he decided to refrain from speaking   for two whole years so that he could look at her and   say "my darling". But at the end of the two years he   wished to tell her that he loved her. Because of this   he waited three more years without speaking (bringing   the total number of silent years to 5).      But at the end of these five years he realized that he   had to ask her to marry him. So he waited ANOTHER   four years without speaking.

I have just listened to the NBC nightly news and I think I am so sick of the greedy SOB's, I will not trust big organizations again.      The idiots!!

Then there is the ridiculous purchase of another $50 mil. for a luxury jet.      Enough to make you sick?   Well, that is not all, folks.      Several of the very well known charity orgs. have mysteriously   '  lost  '  hundreds of millions of $.  It is 'unaccounted for.'   I am sure if we could look at all the top people in these  'humanitarian' charities, we would find the 'missing' money real fast in fat bank accounts.      I know it will not do any good to rant and rave and say how sickening these people are, but it makes me feel better to complain loudly about it.  Now is the time I wish I used profane language -  I would use every word I've ever heard to describe them.      Does anyone feel more anger than I do?

There was a song during Ocean's 12, when Vincent Cassel is jumping through the lasers and such. Songs like that. Also, a while back I heard a French girl doing some rap. It flowed so smoothely, sounded---well, sounded dang sexy. Anything like that, I'd love, or someone like Flogging Molly and Dropkick Murphy.

It's even been asked on here before and nothing.  I even tried to contact the creators of the movie and received no response.        I'd really like to buy it legally, but if that's not an option, a free download link works for me too I guess.  I'll try to donate or something to make up for it.        It's great music.  I just want to hear it without the narration of the movie.      If anything, even the name of the artists who created the music is good enough for me.  Any info would be appreciated.

20090130180813AAbEEra	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Movie; The Wrestler...what do you think was the theme of the movie?	I hate wrestling, but I loved this movie.  Don't see it if you are feeling down, because it is a little depressing yet at the same time uplifting.  Agree?    It seems there were a lot of "timing" issues that happens in life.  Each of the characters were caught in the "spotlight" of what they do, she did not understand his until she saw his match, then I believe she knew what it was that drew him into what he does, what it had meant to him, how it had to be.    She realized that it was "over" for her, now it was time to take care of her son and possibly start a family, but it was timing.      His relationship with his daughter clicked.  She allowed herself to open up to him one more time, and one more time it was more of the same.    So does the movie end on a high note or a low one?

Learn about new things.   But still nothing’s changed since.      Chorus      She’s going to make a difference,   She’s gotten better,   She’s special to the world,   And she’s his little treasure.      Chorus      She’s a treasure,   Nothing measures.

20090130182357AAmeLoQ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why do white people always have to walk on egg shells?	for starters i'm not racist at all.   so if you think i am, go get bent.      HOWEVER, every other race in the world is aloud to receive special treatment. for example, holidays, months, scholarships, organizations ect.   all other races except for caucasian people.      i am aware of the history of slavery and everything, but when it comes down to it, all races have at one point been a slave. i am not justifying any of it either.      i'm just saying.    why do caucasian people have to walk around on egg shells like have done something wrong? why should we be denied special treatment, awards, programs, scholarships? everyone else receive it.

20090130191731AAsL1XL	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Movie with an African-American MAIN character?	A guy friend brought this upon me yesterday at out lockers.  After the inauguration and all, I guess he was thinking about segregation and freedoms that blacks do and do not have.     He challenged me to come up with a movie where the main character is black. To my surprise, I couldn't think of one! All I thought about was 'Jump In' but that's Disney...not really what I call a real movie.    So I'd like to challenge the people of Yahoo!Answers to do the same. Come up with a movie where the main character was African-American. You can probably think of some much more easily than I can, hahah.     Thank you!  :]      ps. if you think I'm being racist in any way, PLEASE read the question again and realize that I'm simply asking a question. I'm not saying it's a good thing I can't come up with any movies. I actually think it's pretty bad considering the fact that this is now a free nation and America still has it's flaws.

I've heard it on the radio a ton recently, and it's been playing for a little over a month or two. When I first heard it, it was soft and I thought Stevie Nicks was singing. Then, the second time I heard it (yesterday in the car...the dj didn't say who it was, though!), I realized it was a man singing.      The lyrics go something/sound something like this: "and it's through my reflection, a (snow-covered hill), with a landslide..." something. "Through my reflection" seems to be a common line, so I thought it was the title...but I guess I was mistaken.      Help! I hate it when this happens - I hear a song I really like, and then i DON'T KNOW WHO SINGS IT!    Thanks ~

I was watching the movie "Another Cinderella Story" and I really liked the song "New Classic". But every time I listen to the song, I feel like to know it from somewhere else. Not the lyrics, but the actual music (beat, rhythm, acoustics, whatever its called). For some reason it strongly reminds me of Justin Timberlake's songs (maybe Sexy Back?).    So, is it just me, or does this song remind you of any song?

Since you here please answer my question =p      Me and my girlfriend have been going out for about 14 months, but like 2 months ago she said that she is always bored and stuff. Thats when she started hanging around this guy she goes to school with.   At first she would hang out with him with out even telling me because she knew i would get jealous, and she was right. I dont even know this kid, and I hate him because I dont like him taking my spot. My girlfriend is not the slutty type, but a very nice girl, so she wouldnt cheat on me.   Yesterday she wanted to hang out with him to sled instead of doing something with me, but i decide to go over and sled with the two of them. We wait like all day doing nothing for him to show up, but then he gets called to work and doesnt come. So the day is wasted and we didnt do anything but watch tv. Today she decides to spend the entire day with him instead of me, when we didnt have any fun yesterday because of her stupid friend.      Im mad and upset because of this, and she just calls me jealous. Should I be?

20090130191553AAanGDu	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I would like stars, but do you think this joke  is funny?	Husband Store       A store that sells new husbands has opened in  New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:       You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!      So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:      Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs    She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:       Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.   'That's nice,' she thinks, 'but I want more.'    So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:    Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.    'Wow,' she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going.   She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:    Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.   'Oh, mercy me!' she exclaims, 'I can hardly stand it!' Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:    Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.       She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:      Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store. (keep reading!)          PLEASE NOTE:       To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.      The first floor has wives that love sex.       The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.       The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

20090130205514AAThK4j	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	This would impress me if the gov learned to react to this?	When an ice storm hits an area, I can only cite the one in the news right now in my area, that Kentutcky is in such bad shape. This is the type of new program that should be the upmost important concern for the country when these natural disasters hit. They need to make it quicker and an easier process to get help, get troops in the area, get money flowing in, make arrangements with a blanketed area in a safer area to direct those who can leave and find quick and free or affordable help. This would impress me, if they could get what really matters figured out and in action, more than any other issue we have. It would be nice, if they could figure out a way to organize a group of volunteer supporters, other than the Red Cross, to help make arrangements etc and find info out. I know I spend enough time on the computer that if I was handed the responsibility to say, contact a hundred hotels in a specific area and start that process up for example, I would be more than happy to use my own cell minutes and computer to get that done. Does anyone else feel that way? That a group of regular citizens could get work done and let the gov work on the hard aspects so it could save lives faster??

20090130205350AAsO1kP	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Don't you hate anime fans who are biased against dubbed animes?	I'm tired of seeing anime fans tarnish the otaku name. They act all 'N00Bish' and refuse to watch english dubbed episodes. What is so terrible about watching it in your native language? Seriously. Lets all grow up people. I admit there are alot of terrible voice actors who make me want to puke when I see them in animes, but FUNamation and VIZ have the greatest team of actors I have ever seen(I actually prefer their english dubb edition of Code Geass than the Japanese. And NOT because of Jonny Young Bosch. I didn't even know him before watching it.). They actually listen to the fanbase and voice their characters on that basis. Now companies like 4KIDS...thats a different story(think One Peice). Really, am I being stupid or does anyone else agree with me that some otakus take this a little too extreme?

This is the saddest Rin and Sesshomaru Fanfiction I've ever read in my entire life! I actually cried for a long time!!!    http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2576639/1/       2 would you rather spend the entire day watching your most hated anime show, or spending the entire day with your most hated anime character?   ==>> I would rather spend it with my most hated character because, I guess being able to actually meet Kikyo would be a great honor since shes from my absolute fave anime, even if shes a *****, plus I would like to get to know her better since I dont really know why I hate her :P (plz, I dont want to start any arguments)      3 How often do you watch anime in one day?   ==>> For me it depends. Either I watch a couple episodes from random animes, dont watch anime at all, or if I found a new anime I like, I dont stop watching it unless I'm busy or if I finish it.      4 Your walking alone through the woods and you hear someone yell "Die *insert you name here*!" It turns out to be your fave character. How do you react   ==>> Sesshomaru! NOOOO!!! Please let me live!!!

(he told me)      im so confused.   do you think the one guy like me?   if yeah then why doesn't he just tell me?   or something.   thanks for helping         also theres a winter dance coming up soon.      do you think the guy is waiting to    "make a move" then?      or is he just not interested?

Moments start out with   Problems making this work   I try not to take it in   Because if I did,   I'd be sorry   Finally finding out you're my enemy   You hurt me bad   And I think you're glad   I think you think that I'll be moving on      Refrain: Is there a reason   Why you forgot me?   Is the time aging you?   Is it leaving me be?   Are you aware of yourself?   All the crap that you spew?   I'm a teddy bear on the shelf   So bring me back to you      The moment my feet   touched the ground   It seemed like I was sinking down   This feeling of heartache is worse now   And I forgot that you're not mine   I think you stepped over my lines   Do I know you now that you're gone?      Refrain: Is there a reason   Why you forgot me?   Is the time aging you?   Is it leaving me be?   Are you aware of yourself?   All the crap that you spew?   I'm a teddy bear on the shelf   So bring me back to you      How can you stand being around them?   Do you really think they know you?   Do you even know how hard it's been?   Or were they blinding you from my truth?   Where did it go wrong?   Perhaps it was the moment    you ventured outside my door   Now you've become a bad weed    And I'm laying in my tears on the floor      Refrain: Is there a reason   Why you forgot me?   Is the time aging you?   Is it leaving me be?   Are you aware of yourself?   All the crap that you spew?   I'm a teddy bear on the shelf   So bring me back to you      Bridge: There's so much time that we have spent away   Far away from you and you from me   And I'm hoping that we can patch the scars   If you've run out of duct tape to fix your heart,   you should know you can always use mine      Duct tape up that heart ache   Yes you can use mine.   Heart ache, heart ache,   you can use miiiiine   So I'm a teddy bear on the top shelf,    bring me back to you         This is about my best friend from 2nd grade. We seperated in 5th and she got in to a bad crowd. She's had some trouble at home and we don't have classes together. She's morphed in to an uncaring person and I really miss my friend. We talk sometimes like the old times, about the old times and laugh about how silly we were but I'm afraid that my parent's words are written in stone and are hardening every second: the friends you had in elementary and middle school aren't necessarily going to be your friends in high school or college. I loves my friends and we've pledged ourselves as BFFLs. I know it's not enough and I keep thinking about how bad things are. This is what my song is about. I think she's moved on and I'm afraid to let go. I feel depressed.

20090130201328AAbI1P8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Have you ever gotten the feeling that all or at least some of the A&E show "Intervention" is sometimes staged?	It just seems, at times, rather cliche and almost "too much," as if the people featured on the program behave in a far more extreme manner than typical addicts.  The show seems at times to "romanticize" the on-going heartaches, almost as if the "featured" people on the show are being led-on, like a dog and pony show.      Have you ever thought that this show might be staged in order to persuade people in the "war on drugs?"      Just curious.

20090130210558AAeQlmG	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Who are your favorite and least favorite characters on The Real World?	Ok.      My favorite character is Chet, because I can relate to him the most. I've never smoked pot, never done any other illegal drug, never smoked a cigarette and never drank alcohol. I'm an 18 year old virgin planning to save my sex for marriage, because of my religious beliefs, only I'm a Catholic, not a Mormon. And I'm nowhere NEAR metro sexual.      Chet is the next Jon from The Real World Los Angeles.      My least favorite is Ryan. I'm anti war and I admire him for going to war, but he uses his WAR excuse for EVERYTHING! AND he is an extreme homophobe, why can't he just get over it? PLUS, he is very judgmental and likes to stir up conflict with people.       Ryan is the next CT, from The Real World Paris.

[chorus:]   now are you sorry? do you hope i'll forgive you?   do you see now, just how, you killed me?   and when you look back, you'll see that,   in my past, i watched you pass   and maybe one day you will finally see,   just how much you always meant to me,   and how it really ended up to be,   you were never sorry, no no no.   you weren't sorry, no no no.   and maybe one day you will truly be.....sorry.   that i'm sorry

20090130193950AAvOJkz	Entertainment & Music;Music;Jazz	Help finding an instrumental jazz song?	I believe that it is a well known song. I heard it tonight on 107.5(Atlanta) and they never say the name of it. It sounds as though its been altered to have that techno sound. I don't know if this will be much of a help but this is the beat: la la la la (from here is goes to a higher pitch)la la la la la la la la (it starts to fade slightly)la la la la (then it repeats) then the note are drawn out, la la la la la. There is also a hint of drum. If anyone can identify this song I will be extremely appreciative as this has been driving me mad.

Anastacia, "The little lady with the big voice" is an incredible singer. She has a unique soulful voice that replicates a mixture of Taylor Dane, Patti La belle and her own edginess.  She is so popular in Latin America, South Africa, Asia and Australia, but not in her own home country, United States.  It surprises me.  Does anyone know why the United States audience has not embraced Anastacia?

I watched a lecture online and I completely forget what the site was and who the guy was giving the lecture, hopefully he's well known and my description will help.      He was an older guy, white hair, british. He was kind of quarky but he was funny and knowledgable at the same time. He used a piano to demonstrate his points.      The lecture I watched was about classical music in modern society. He talked about how kids take piano lessons and develop their skills to make phrases more seamless with every year. He also plays a piece on the piano and talks about the emotion in it, and its this piece that I want to know and its why I want to find this video again. Thanks for the help

I'm not the best singer, but I seriously am pretty good at writing. One thing bothers me though. When I write songs I do rough recordings of them afterward and then listen to them constantly cause I'm like - wow this song is a hit. But as I'm doing final tweaks, I'm listening to the song and I start being like - this song doesn't move me.      Is that normal for songwriting? Is it just like when you hear a hit song and love it for a few days but then you play it out? Does anyone else experience this?
