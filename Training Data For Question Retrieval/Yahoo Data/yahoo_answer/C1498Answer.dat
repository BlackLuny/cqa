With regard to most Western religions, no. Because God hates gays. Which doesn't make any sense because if God made us, why would God make us into something that he hates and something also in "His image" (I use quotes because the concept of a gendered God is laughable). The implication there is that God is a self-loathing entity who is, in fact gay. <br>  <br>  I believe most Eastern religions don't even breach the issue because...it's a non-issue and trying to pass judgment raises far more difficulties than it puts to rest.|`|fc9oxG8iaa	Depends on the religion. If the scripture of said religion says specifically that gay people are hated and should burn, then probably not.

Just because I do not want one does not mean I have any right to to make that choice for another.  Many people who are against abortion believe that the octo-mom should have terminated many of the fertilized eggs from her last pregnancy, how is it different for her?  And if we define life as beginning at the moment of conception then if a woman miscarries do we charge her with neglect or manslaughter or child abuse?  And if they are illegal do you really think that it will prevent them from happening, or just make it much more dangerous?  People should be more focused on education and the prevention of these unwanted pregnancies.<br>  <br>  3) Gay marriage is a human rights issue, it is no different then bans on bi-racial marriages.  It is wrong, and disgusting that anyone thinks they can take this right away from anyone.  It is not about religion, it is a legal contract.  And making them call it something else is very reminiscent of the "separate but equal" laws that plagued the south, and that history has shown us is not the right way to handle anything.  History will not look kindly on us for the bigoted laws currently being upheld.<br>  <br>  4) Really don't think about it, at all.<br>  <br>  5) to live.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	1) Evolution from monkeys/apes.<br>  <br>  We are a species of ape. We share a common ancestor with other currently existing species of apes and of monkeys. The common ancestor we share with other extant apes was itself an ape, and the common ancestor we share with extant monkeys was itself a monkey. Accordingly  we evolved from apes and monkeys. <br>  <br>  2) Abortion<br>  <br>  I support abortion as an unmitigated right up to the point where the fetus develops enough brain function to experience pain and fear from the procedure. I consider that to be about 6 months. After that I would support restrictions on abortion that attempted to balance the subjective experience of harm from the procedure by the fetus against the subjective experience of harm of denying the procedure to the pregnant woman. Such a balancing test would tend to tilt increasingly in favor of the fetus as it got older.<br>  <br>  3) Gay Marriage<br>  <br>  I strongly support the right of all adults, including gays, to marry whom they please (with the exception of sibling marriages or parent-child marriages that could result in children). I consider this a civil right on a par with the right to marry interracially. I think faith-based restrictions on the right to marry are a violation of the equal protection and establishment clauses of the Constitution.<br>  <br>  4) Existence of Extraterrestrial Beings<br>  <br>  I expect there are probably other intelligent beings out there, based simply on the number of stars. I expect they‚Äôre likely very few and far between, however.<br>  <br>  5) The Meaning of Life.<br>  <br>  Life has no objective meaning, which is a good thing because it leave us each free to find what subjective meaning we may.|`|QlB3VXWraa	1.

It's a lot to think about, and you would need to make a fast judgement call. I could if i felt that was the only option.<br>  If twelve of your peers (jury) would agree that they' do the same in your exact situation then it would be justifiable homicide.|`|vM9CxOKKaa	It depends, if you deliberately went to kill the person I think there would be blood-guilt involved. If it just happened in your self defense, then I imagine that would be accidental death/unintentional. Self defence is okay but of course war is different. War has motivation of defence a different way which is unchristian.|`|0EkJQEV9aa	its not a mortal sin, because you were defending yourself from being killed.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	No it would not be a sin to kill someone in self defense.  That is not murder.
AA11232725	I don't accept it because I don't think there is a shred of evidence that as a baby leaves it's mother's womb it starts thinking that it wants to have sex with another person of the same sex.<br>  <br>  You said people were "born gay" right? How is it that it seems like people don't really have strong sexual desires until quite some time after they are born if they are born gay or heterosexual?|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	The bible was written in an age where tribe size was of the utmost importance. All sexual energy was directed towards filling women with babies as early and as often as possible; all other sexual behavior was criminalized.<br>  <br>  It was a practical matter, and had nothing to do with morality. In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.<br>  <br>  Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).<br>  <br>  You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.<br>  <br>  P.S. When the priests came to arrest Jesus, a young man who was with him dropped his linen cloth and "fled from them naked" (Mark 14:51-52). Need I say more?|`|THRtsl83aa	I do accept that.  I also accept that people have completely natural reasons for being attracted to kids, animals, and dead bodies - but that doesn't mean they should act on it.  Just my opinion.<br>  <br>  To "lighten up already": we tried that with FDR.  Didn't work.  Made the Depression last even longer.  On the other hand, Reagan lowered taxes and encouraged capitalism, and we got out of Carter's recession amazingly fast.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Haha, some days I wish I was lesbian, because guys are just too stupid.  Unfortunately I can't just switch teams.  Anyway, making homosexuality a "choice" makes it easier to discriminate against that "choice."|`|AA11987172	It makes some people feel all warm and fuzzy to condemn gays.  Pity them.|`|0YL8qVMsaa	Wouldn't it be nice if we could choose our sexualities? Too bad it doesn't work that way.|`|eC5QIpnbaa	because  they aren't born gay. were it genetic  or inborn it would have been proved by now. so far science has disproved every " inborn" theory" that the activists have come up with. There are lots of people who choose lifestyles that are  " discriminated against" coprophages, pedophiles, zoophiles, drug addicts, prostitutes, the list goes on and on. gays make their choice and thats all there is to it.|`|46e820e9ba704c6776305bf6a1b991efaa	That might be true in some cases.  But still, some people are born predisposed to adultery.  But it isn't adultery unless the person acts on their urges.  If someone has the misfortune of being born a homosexual then they have to refrain from sex just like many handicapped people do.|`|wRo4iV0kaa	... that's like me asking why cant people accept that schizophrenic people aren't born schizophrenic! They are but that's a disease that cannot be controlled! And you have to take meds to help you.. gay people ARE NOT born gay! and just asking if SO many people think they are HOW CAN YOU PROVE IT if it isn't even scientifically proven..???|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	You are absolutely positively right!  I've seen children grow up that showed some signs of being gay/lesbian and as they grew older they became gay.  God created us all.  He loves us unconditionally.  Do I think Ellen Degeneres is going to hell? No.  Do I think Tim Gunn is going to hell?  No.  I mean, if they don't believe in Jesus they may go to hell, but for being gay???? NO.  It makes me sick to see people suffer because of gender issues, especially our little babies, our children, who are so innocent.  If a little boy says, "I want to be a girl"  or a little girl who says, "i want to be a boy"  WHO CARES?   Why put them down?  Oooooo, it ticks me off.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, I don't know why we have intolerance and I really don't understand why WE ALL don't stand up for our children and their children's children.|`|2ogimlBxaa	They think homosexuals should never participate in homosexual sex. They think homosexuals should never make love with the person they love.<br>  <br>  Kind of douchey, eh?|`|C7Mfo0soaa	People don't deny they are born with tendencies.  They claim that the person, whether gay or not, makes a decision to have sex with another person.  It's really pretty straight forward.|`|JjoBtLjbaa	Drop a baby on its head.<br>  <br>  It explains so much.|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	Their minds are bound by their traditions. They are unable to see things in a different light.|`|OvWdQ1c5aa	i think that many people are ok with people being homosexual, but what annoys them is that some people are bi, which means they choose the homo way, they are not born gay but do it because it's in fashion and it's "cool' to be gay now.I also think that some homosexual people behave wrong by calling heterosexual names, like telling them that it's better to be gay and that heterosexuals are ****.I knew such person.|`|LF4vun1maa	They want to feel good and righteous about their hatred, and it's no longer socially acceptable to hate people for being born who they are.  It's a problem.  <br>  <br>  The simple solution is to convince themselves of the obvious lie that people choose their sexuality.<br>  <br>  Don't bother looking for a good reason, there isn't one.  It's all about justifying one's hate to oneself.|`|AA11613273	OH MY GOOD GOD, BECAUSE THEIR BIBLE TELLS THEM IT'S A SIN AND A CHOICE!  <br>  <br>  Jesus, it's not a choice.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	In my opinion<br>  <br>  Many people have an instinct for a behavior that is bad for them... Alcoholics, Compulsive Gamblers, etc.<br>  <br>  Just because you have an instinct for something doesn't mean you have to pursue it. It's not fair that some people have to struggle their whole lives with alcoholism... and some never have a problem.<br>  <br>  No one would argue that using something other than the way it was intended can be quite harmful. Alcohol is fine, drunkeness is dangerous. Same deal with sex. Sex is good, perversed sex is harmful.<br>  <br>  The instinct to want something unhealthy doesn't suddenly make it ok. I have an instinct to overeat. It is a serious health concern of mine. Claiming I was "born this way" doesn't change the fact that my instinct is causing me to harm myself.|`|57ff60a0e4ef9100f02b3999f816d21eaa	i think it is a social disorder brought about by the stresses of a complex social system. only humans seem to be gay.<br>  <br>  it was shown that brains of gay men resembled the same patterns to brains of women. i don't remember the special's name, it was on discovery channel. <br>  <br>  i agree they are born with their mental illness with late onset as are most mental illnesses. but society won't let us try to help with medication because it is apparently discrimination to help those that are sick.<br>  <br>  sczitsophrenia is a mental illness, so is bipolar disorder. but i guess since these people can't effectively complain while they are sick, we are allowed to treat those illnesses.<br>  <br>  would you accept someone mentally ill being your child's school teacher? how about antisocial disorder, a remorseless murderer.|`|S66qDzVzaa	Because its hard to argue that you have been gay since you were born because most people don't remember being born...and sexuality doesn't really become asserted until later in life, so it leaves room to argue that theres a gap where what (or who, i guess) would have been heterosexual somehow becomes homosexual. hope that helps :)|`|4acf689398f7f59c1a8e655179687076aa	There are a lot of very good answers here already, some subtly laced with bigotry and others demonstrating a true desire to accepting people who are different but not so much understanding them. :) <br>  <br>  Maybe we don't have to understand other people, but instead understand why, if we're bigoted, ourselves, and why WE have those erroneous beliefs in the first place. People aren't born with ideas after all, and have our beliefs, values and traditions eventually place in our psychies to construct the person that we are. Unfortunately we aren't really "blank slates" at birth either and have a tendency to seek out belief systems to support our reasons for living a certain way. <br>  <br>  I think those folk who argue that people are just not comfortable challenging what they're used to have the right idea. Understanding isn't the issue, it's challenging what we beileved was true all along that does. Best thing to do is to educate future generations to think on their own. My very humble opinion. <br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|pDmTRG82aa	you're asking irrational people to be rational<br>  <br>  that would be like trying to make americans understand that if they want to get out of the recession sooner that we should use socialism. but no, most people would rather be poor in a capitalistic society than have a good living in a socialistic one. its useless to argue about these things|`|RiyzkMO7aa	Don't waste your time sweetie. They don't reason back with logic.

Unfortunately, if a child is indoctrinated from babyhood, and brought up in an environment where religious belief is the norm, they are not likely to look beyond their original teaching for answers, or to question it, unless education gives them the impetus.<br>  <br>  I was brought up in the church, and was sent to Sunday school - the whole 9 yards.  When I was 7, I started to ask questions which no-one could answer properly, and by the age of 10 I was an atheist.|`|dZFwQPsGaa	What's even scarier, is that people with an obvious the obvious gift of intelligence, use it to further their own selfish agendas.  For example, scientists (or anyone for that matter) who try to use evolution to disprove God.<br>  <br>  That's sad--they should know better.<br>  <br>  Or worse--people that have logic and talent for learning use it to "make the world a better place" by introducing such concepts as social darwinism, abortion and controlling those who are "ignorant". Making sure that only "pure" people reproduce.<br>  <br>  Seems like we've been down that "smart" road before.|`|LF4vun1maa	Yes, but it's to be expected.<br>  <br>  Gods survive on ignorance.

We believe that Jesus is the son of God, he was born of the Virgin Mary, he was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered, died, and was buried. On the third day he ascended into heaven. He died for our sins so that we may also go to heaven. So long as you believe, and express this belief, you will go to heaven. Some of the bigger things that sets Catholicism apart includes the acknowledgment of one baptism, praying for the interdiction of saints, and the belief that during communion it IS the blood and body of Christ, not just a symbolic thing.|`|obs5s1TGaa	Catholics are Christians tell all the haters to back off!|`|0GEcJFYNaa	well in some ways they are similar and some ways they are a little bit different catholics focus more on the virgin mary well at least that's what it seems like to me and christians main focus is god catholic churches look different then christian churches do and some of the teachings are different for example christians don't have palms and they don't burn candles and etc.|`|P3s3UIlcaa	its a wash|`|kqk1Mqqsaa	Yes they are!!!!

Because humans are social beings capable of empathy, as well as protecting their own interests, they needed a some kind of code, something that dictated appropriate behavior.  Now the specifics of that code has varied over time, and varies with different cultures, however, the basis generally exist: Don't kill someone, don't take their stuff, play fair.  Now obviously there are variations on the theme, loopholes etc, but the very fact that these rules exist, for anyone establishes that good and evil exist.<br>  <br>  Good= following the code<br>  evil= going against the code<br>  <br>  The "code' (for want of a better word) has been interpreted, changed, violated, manipulated, miscommunicated, evolved, parsed, etc etc and is generally pretty complex.<br>  <br>  Complex as it is, that is not evidence of a higher being enforcing fairness and rightness.<br>  <br>  The onus of that falls on man.  <br>  Now that's pretty scary, especially for atheists, who understand that there is nothing out there that's going to save them if they screw up.<br>  <br>  Many religious people believe that athiests are happy that they can do evil deeds without fear of divine retribution. <br>  The inverse is true:<br>  <br>  Without the oversight of a divine being, a good atheist seriously develop their conscience, and develop a strong moral compass, knowing that, at the back of it, there is no reward except the intrinsic knowledge that they have done good, or conversely God will not punish you for evil, but your conscience will bear the blemish of evil doing.<br>  <br>  As with any faith or absence of it in the case of atheists, there are people who are good and people who are evil.<br>  <br>  If people were basically evil, there would be no concept of good or evil.  There would be a concept of opportunism, of might, of victory.<br>  <br>  But the very fact that there is a concept of good is evidence that people desire it, and if people desire it they can write it into the "code"<br>  <br>  So yes, People are basically good.<br>  <br>  Now people are not perfect, because the human psyche is an inexact science.<br>  <br>  But we would live in a very, very different world if people were evil.<br>  <br>  And either way, God would have nothing to do with it.  You can only have an effect on something if you exist.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	On the general, yes.  We evolved as social creatures.<br>  <br>  However, like many inheritable traits, just how strongly the urges for empathy and altruism is a spectrum of values -- some people have little of either and would not likely be particularly moral people.|`|AA12360579	I think that all people are born blank slates, and they are then impacted by their parents, their environment, and the society that surrounds them.|`|2ogimlBxaa	I think we're born amoral, actually, and acquire morals as we grow.|`|70OClBEQaa	Depends|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Where did you ever get the notion that christians think people are evil?|`|1g49KgoGaa	No, we don't put people in boxes with labels.|`|eggQk1d7aa	I think that each and every person is different, and the atheist definition of "evil" is a lot more realistic than the Christian definition of "evil".

It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Take your time, ask questions, consider carefully, and then make your decision. The Buddha was not interested in having a large number of disciples.

Qc6MqcpWaa	Goddidit.|`|UiUSsfuYaa	Vestigial organs are a misconception. Someone in science called them that because they could not figure out what their purpose was, and the rest of science used it as an excuse not to further research them. After all, if Darwinian science says something is useless, who are we to question it? (Unless of course, Darwin is *gasp* WRONG.)<br>  <br>  Now scientists are discovering that so-called vestigial organs DO have a purpose. The purpose of the appendix is to act as a "safe house" for the beneficial bacteria living in the human gut. The appendix is part of the immune system, strategically located at the entrance of the almost sterile ileum from the colon with its normally high bacterial content.<br>  The tonsils have a similar function in the entrance to the pharynx.<br>  The pineal gland secretes malatonin which is a hormone that regulates the circadian rhythm and has other functions.<br>  The thymus is part of the immune system, related to T-cells. HIV attacks T-cells, rendering them ineffective and for this reason is always eventually fatal.<br>  The number of organs that once were believed to be functional in the evolutionary past of humans but are non-functional today has been steadily reduced as the fields of anatomy and physiology have progressed. Few examples of vestigial organs in humans are now offered, and the ones that are have been shown by more recent research to be completely functional.|`|LCNpCrw4aa	Humans were created with these organs as a means to distinguish us from the apes that Darwin in his "theory" claims we all are.|`|2YWKeJ6Aaa	god is testing us?|`|zgs3LGpjaa	God loves us so much, he gives us extra things. It's that simple|`|ZnjsqwoZaa	--- The human coccyx is the attachment point of nine muscles that allow for a number of movements, most important of which is for the act of defecation. Evolutionists should ask Ashley Murry of Wilmington, Delaware if she agrees with their conclusion that a coccyx is unnecessary. This young woman will be forced to wear a diaper for her entire life because she was born without a coccyx. It is unlikely that she would be very supportive of their contention. <br>  <br>  -- Another important use of the coccyx is that it assists us in the act of sitting. It is not impossible to sit without one, but it is awkward and uncomfortable. Furthermore, the coccyx helps to support certain internal organs.<br>  <br>  <br>  --- THE APPENDIX<br>  <br>  Hurriyet Bilim describes the appendix, which lies at the beginning of the large intestine, as functionless. It has long been the best known of all the allegedly "vestigial" organs, though that this assumption has been proven to result from ignorance. True, that the appendix does sometimes becomes infected and poses a danger to health. But it still has important functions in all healthy individuals, as is set out in one scientific paper that cities various anatomical sources as references:<br>  <br>  An examination of the appendix microscopically, shows that it contains a significant amount of lymphoid tissue. Similar aggregates of lymphoid tissue (known as gut-associated lymphoid tissues, GALT) occur in other areas of the gastrointestinal system. The GALT are involved in the body's ability to recognize foreign antigens in ingested material. My own research, in particular, is focused on examining the immunological functions of the intestine. <br>  <br>  --- The tissue referred to as the "third eyelid" by Hurriyet Bilim consists of a thin fold at the inner corner of the eye. Darwin portrayed this tissue as a "vestigial organ," and it is commonly referred to as the semilunar fold.<br>  <br>  However, this tissue, with the scientific name plica semilunaris, is not a functionless structure inherited from reptiles, as Darwin (and Hurriyet Bilim) believed. Researchers have shown that the plica semilunaris secretes a fatty liquid that moisturises the eye, playing an important role in protecting it from foreign bodies. (7)<br>  <br>  Therefore, referring to this tissue as a vestigial organ only highlights the ignorance and bigotry of Darwin, and those who blindly follow in his footsteps.<br>  <br>  --- Goose bumps are caused by muscle contractions. These force oil into the follicle and onto the skin. This traps air around the surface of the skin and provides added insulation.<br>  <br>  Neither hair nor goose bumps have to be explained in evolutionary terms. Everything has the capacity to feel cold whether man or animal. Having hair in common with the animals is thus no more significant than the fact that we both have eyes, or mouths.<br>  <br>  --- In assuming the third molars, commonly known as wisdom teeth, are in fact vestigial, Hurriyet Bilim repeats a classic evolutionist error.<br>  <br>  This is a widespread misconception. Many dentists adopt a moderate approach to day-to-day problems posed by other teeth and seek to preserve them, while extracting wisdom teeth has become routine. But the fact is, some recent research has shown that these teeth are no different from any other in terms of function. (4) Studies have also shown that the belief that these molars disrupt the position of other teeth is unfounded. (5) Scientific criticisms have also been published of problems encountered in extracting these teeth, when medicines could be used. (6)<br>  <br>  In conclusion, contemporary medicine agrees that the belief that wisdom teeth do have a masticatory function just like the other teeth.<br>  <br>  That being so, why do wisdom teeth cause a many people such great discomfort? Scientists researching this question established that wisdom teeth presented very infrequent problems to pre-industrial societies. Over the past few centuries, the preference for soft foods over hard ones has impacted on jaw development. Therefore, it's been determined that most wisdom teeth problems have emerged in connection with problems resulting from dietary habits.<br>  Similar changes in dietary preferences are known to have a negative impact on other teeth. For example, the preference for sugary and acidic foods over the past century has led to an increase in the rate of tooth decay. This, of course, does not mean that our teeth are functionless or vestigial. The same applies to wisdom teeth. Problems with these teeth stem not from any evolutionary "vestigialization," but from modern dietary habits.<br>  <br>  wikipedia.com<br>  britannica.com<br>  Icr.com<br>  Angelfire.com<br>  Creationscienceevangelism.com<br>   exposingliesinevolution.com|`|c1yfnzuVaa	Why can't evolution and Christianity coincide?|`|495e344229dc3bcc5dcbf3cd52fed97eaa	God made all of our bodies, except for all of the parts which clearly prove evolution, which were made by Satan.|`|oVHFz52Laa	So that you can ask about them<br>  <br>  God made us perfect, but we are living in the allen world.

xZ1GD4zbaa	I was twenty when I first started hearing the gospel. My mom became fascinated with the 700 club, and I despised those people, Pat Robertson especially, to the core.<br>  <br>  Every morning my mom would have it on the TV and it took all I had in me not to pick up the TV and throw it out the window!<br>  <br>  But the angrier I got, the more it made me think about WHY I was so angry. I mean if it was just BS, why did it get under my skin? <br>  I finally decided to go ahead and pray the sinner's prayer for no other reason than to prove it meant nothing at all. It wasn't magical, or powerful, because there was no God to pray to in the first place.<br>  <br>  I was wrong!<br>  <br>  That afternoon I began to have a mystical "knowing" that I never experienced before. I suddenly began to see things from different angles and what used to really push my buttons, didn't even bother me like it once did.<br>  <br>  Even so, it still took about five years of me testing and even tempting God but in the end there was no way of denying it; God is real; His Son Jesus is real and everything the bible says is true.<br>  <br>  I've been a born again Christian for more than twenty six years now and I've seen too many miracles, and seen too many lives changed for the better to believe it's all been coincidence.|`|sebhK7r7aa	I began losing my faith last year.

Because people are still developing their personalities at your age, most of their relationships aren't the ones they'll have for the rest of their lives.  But there are plenty of exceptions to that.<br>  <br>  I have a good friend I've known since high school and he and his wife started dating when they were both 14-year-old freshmen.  They didn't ever date anyone else, they remained devoted to each other when they attended different colleges, and they got married when they were in their mid twenties.  At this point, they're both 40 and have three kids.  I asked my friend if he ever wondered if he missed out on anything by never dating anyone other than his wife.  He laughed and said, "I just always felt complete with Stacey, so it never really occurred to me to date anyone else."  Sometimes soulmates are just fortunate enough to meet when they're really young.  If you've already found your life partner, I consider you lucky!  Best wishes!

You see these obstacles as devastating, and so do I, as I am human. However, we can not compare to God, the supreme being. The problems that we face in daily life, we pray to God about, asking why he can not help us right away. However, for those who tuly believe in God, he is never "late." He may come and rescue you from the hardships of your life when you least expect it, when you are at wit's end. However, God will not let you die off because he was "late" in saving you. What you view as "late" and "when is God going to help me" is seen as right on time for God.

For the record, I'm not. The only really honest answer I can give to this is that I don't know. But what I do know is my God and I trust him. I know that he does not have a character that likes inflicting pain or enjoys people's suffering.<br>  <br>  I've spent a lot of time thinking about this one over the years. Some people have given me brainy logical answers saying suffering is down to our own sinfulness. Or if God dramatically intervened in human suffering then we couldn't choose to believe in him anymore and we have to be free to choose. These answers do not satisfy me.<br>  <br>  suffering1.jpgLogically, either God has the power to prevent suffering and doesn't (which shows he's not very loving), or he loves us and wants to stop suffering but is powerless to do anything.<br>  <br>  Things aren't as simple as that though. The problem with logic like that is that it doesn't always apply to real life. The God I've gotten to know and have seen working in my own life is a God who loves each one of us so much that he was prepared to die on the cross because of that love. To say God doesn't love us - well, it just doesn't ring true.<br>  <br>  So is God powerless then? Well, no! I mean, he created everything, we depend on him for every breath, and I've known people be healed - to say God doesn't have power, that doesn't stand up to the evidence either.<br>  <br>  Logic says either God doesn't love us or isn't powerful - but experience of God says that just isn't the case. Sometimes cold hard logic just isn't enough.<br>  <br>  So logically, I haven't a scoob why God would allow suffering. I do know though, that we will all go through suffering - guaranteed.<br>  <br>  When I got married it was the happiest day of my life. However, there was a bitter edge to it; a very close family member wasn't able to come because he was in hospital fighting for his life. In the weeks leading up to the wedding we had three phone calls telling us we should prepare ourselves for the worst. We seriously considered postponing my wedding, but we felt that the family should have something positive to celebrate and decided to go ahead with it.<br>  <br>  One of the hymns we sung at my wedding was really hard to sing. It is based around one of the psalms in the Bible and contains the lines: "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me, your rod and staff protect and comfort me." As a family, we had walked under the shadow of death during the weeks before - but even in the pain, the uncertainty, the questions about why this was happening, God did not leave us, and He did not leave my relative.<br>  <br>  suffering2.jpg Sometimes it was hard to feel God's presence, sometimes I got angry with God, sometimes I felt so empty that I wondered if God had deserted us - but He was right there with us, even when I didn't feel it. God was there in the middle of our suffering and pain.<br>  <br>  It was only later that I realised that God, maker of heaven and earth, knows suffering first hand. Through Jesus he has experienced pain, rejection, persecution, hunger and death. But more than that - Jesus has experienced what it feels like when circumstances, emotions and pain tell us God isn't there. He knows how it feels when events feel godless. As he died on a cross, Jesus cried out, "My God, My God, Why have you left me?"* We shout out similar statements in times of suffering; Where are you God?<br>  <br>  God will always be with you in your suffering. God might not prevent it - suffering is an unavoidable part of life for everyone - but he will be with you when it matters. He knows what it feels like. And He will carry you through.|`|EwvZCLkjaa	watching you hopping you make it<br>  bad things happen to test your faith<br>  have you ever read the bible?<br>  its all in there<br>  anyway you should believe what you want<br>  if your religion doesnt work for you find one that does<br>  even if god is real that doesnt mean he's gonna hold your hand your whole life<br>  your going to suffer everyone does, its life|`|29zyJ95Eaa	Well there isn't a 'God' in our world right here, right now.<br>  Sure he might of existed thousands of years ago but he doesn't exist today.

He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the Lord. Across the sky flashed scenes from his life. For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand; one belonging to him, and the other to the Lord. <br>  <br>  When the last scene of his life flashed before him he looked back at the footprints in the sand. He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints. He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life. <br>  <br>  This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it. "Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, you'd walk with me all the way. But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life, there is only one set of footprints. I don't understand why when I needed you most you would leave me." <br>  <br>  The Lord replied, "My precious, precious child, I love you and I would never leave you.

We have to walk our own path and handle the situation. <br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|dpSLWzvmaa	read the bible and find out. i couldn't tell you myself, that's for you to find out i guess. religion isn't mind control, not completely at least|`|3sSYxWN0aa	The die-hard Christian answer: 'Testing you faith'<br>  <br>  The atheist answer: Not existing<br>  <br>  The agnostic answer: not quite existing as people think he/she does.|`|xa4AgcXeaa	God is real...he never makes us suffer more than we can take. the same thing happened to my friend but it was bc of family issues, it was in his mind.

FvoxgjbJaa	Pope Gregory XVI, Summo Iugiter Studio, May 27, 1832, on no salvation outside the Church: ‚ÄúYou know how zealously Our predecessors taught that article of faith which these dare to deny, namely the necessity of the Catholic faith and of unity for salvation‚Ä¶ Omitting other appropriate passages which are almost numberless in the writings of the Fathers, We shall praise St. Gregory the Great who expressly testifies that THIS IS INDEED THE TEACHING OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.  He says: ‚ÄòThe holy universal Church teaches that it is not possible to worship God truly except in her and asserts that all who are outside of her will not be saved.‚Äô  Official acts of the Church proclaim the same dogma.  Thus, in the decree on faith which Innocent III published with the synod of Lateran IV, these things are written: ‚ÄòThere is one universal Church of all the faithful outside of which no one is saved.‚Äô  Finally the same dogma is also expressly mentioned in the profession of faith proposed by the Apostolic See, not only that which all Latin churches use, but also that which‚Ä¶ other Eastern Catholics use.  We did not mention these selected testimonies because We thought you were ignorant of that article of faith and in need of Our instruction.  Far be it from Us to have such an absurd and insulting suspicion about you.  But We are so concerned about this serious and well known dogma, which has been attacked with such remarkable audacity, that We could not restrain Our pen from reinforcing this truth with many testimonies.‚Äù<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Pope Eugene IV, The Council of Florence, ‚ÄúExultate Deo,‚Äù Nov. 22, 1439:  ‚ÄúHoly baptism, which is the gateway to the spiritual life, holds the first place among all the sacraments; through it we are made members of Christ and of the body of the Church.  And since death entered the universe through the first man, ‚Äòunless we are born again of water and the Spirit, we cannot,‚Äô as the Truth says, ‚Äòenter into the kingdom of heaven‚Äô [John 3:5].  The matter of this sacrament is real and natural water.‚Äù<br>  <br>   ‚Äú‚Ä¶ the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ Nor is there salvation in any other.  For there is no other name, under heaven, given to men, whereby we must be saved.‚Äù (Acts 4:12).  <br>  <br>   <br>  ‚ÄúIf anyone abideth not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth.‚Äù (John 15:6)<br>  <br>  The present Church in Rome is NOT the Roman Catholic Church.

If you are looking for scientific arguments for Creation and/or against evolution, we highly recommend Answers in Genesis - <a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org," rel="nofollow">http://www.answersingenesis.org,</a> and the Institute for Creation Research ‚Äì <a href="http://www.icr.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.icr.org.</a> The purpose of this article is to explain why, according to the Bible, the creation vs. evolution debate even exists. Romans 1:25 declares, "They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator - who is forever praised. Amen."<br>  <br>  A key factor in the debate is that the majority of scientists who believe in evolution are also atheists or agnostics. There are some who hold to some form of theistic evolution, and others who take a deistic view of God (God exists but is not involved in the world, and everything proceeds along a natural course). There are some who genuinely and honestly look at the data and arrive at the conclusion that evolution betters fits with the data. Again, though, these represent an insignificant percentage of scientists who advocate evolution. The vast majority of evolutionary scientists hold that life evolved entirely without ANY intervention of a higher Being. Evolution is by definition a naturalistic science.<br>  <br>  For atheism to be true, there must be an alternate explanation‚Äîother than a Creator‚Äîfor how the universe and life came into existence. Although beliefs in some form of evolution predated Charles Darwin, Darwin was the first to develop a plausible model for how evolution could have occurred‚Äînatural selection. Darwin once identified himself as a Christian, but later renounced the Christian faith and the existence of God as a result of some tragedies that took place in his life. So evolution was invented by an atheist. Darwin's goal was not to disprove God's existence, but that is one of the end results of the theory of evolution. Evolution is an enabler of atheism. Evolutionary scientists likely would not admit that their goal is to give an alternate explanation of the origins of life, and thereby to give a foundation for atheism, but according to the Bible, that is exactly why the theory of evolution exists.<br>  <br>  The Bible tells us, "The fool says in his heart, 'There is no God'" (Psalm 14:1; 53:1). The Bible also proclaims that people are without excuse for not believing in a Creator God. "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities - His eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse" (Romans 1:20). According to the Bible, anyone who denies the existence of God is a fool. Why, then, are so many people, including some Christians, willing to accept that evolutionary scientists are unbiased interpreters of scientific data? According to the Bible, they are all fools! Foolishness does not imply a lack of intelligence. Most evolutionary scientists are brilliant intellectually. Foolishness indicates an inability to properly apply knowledge. Proverbs 1:7 tells us, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline."<br>  <br>  Evolutionary scientists mock creation and/or intelligent design as unscientific and not worthy of scientific examination. In order for something to be considered a "science," they argue, it must be able to be observed and tested, it must be "naturalistic." Creation is by definition "supernatural." God, and the supernatural, cannot be observed or tested (so the argument goes), therefore creation and/or intelligent design cannot be considered a science. Of course, neither can evolution be observed or tested, but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue with the evolutionists. As a result, all data is filtered through the preconceived, presupposed, and pre-accepted theory of evolution, without alternate explanations being considered.<br>  <br>  However, the origin of the universe and the origin of life cannot be tested or observed. Both creation and evolution are faith-based systems in regard to origins. Neither can be tested because we cannot go back billions (or thousands) of years to observe the origin of the universe and life in the universe. Evolutionary scientists reject creation on grounds that would logically force them to also reject evolution as a scientific explanation of origins. Evolution, at least in regards to origins, does not fit the definition of ‚Äúscience‚Äù any more than creation does. Evolution is supposedly the only explanation of origins that can be tested; therefore, it is the only theory of origins that can be considered "scientific." This is foolishness! Scientists who advocate evolution are rejecting a plausible theory of origins without even honestly examining its merits, because it does not fit their illogically narrow definition of "science."<br>  <br>  If creation is true, then|`|gQEFy4BVaa	Buddhism is an atheistic religion. Is that what you mean?|`|OBV4AKIXaa	Didn't know there was such a thing...
k4d57dvJaa	that is true. mathew 5:48 is a scripture avoided by all these religions. The scriptures tell you to be perfect, that is our goal, to reach perfection and to be blameless in gods eyes. but how can we be blameless and perfect when these religions aren't telling us how to. Thats why the scriptures tell you that God will send you prophets in his name which will teach you. John 14:16 talks about the comforter which will be sent in gods name to teach you all things. The comforter was sent to the nation of israel and has been teaching gods people in the israelite church of god in jesus christ.|`|ZYUpEdcqaa	You really are very dense.  Obviously we can not be perfect because we fall short of that.  But we need to try our hardest to be perfect.  It's kind of obvious I thought.<br>  What is better; to know we can not be perfect and not strive for it?  Or know we aren't perfect, but do our best to try and be as perfect as we can.|`|XpZumlkwaa	In my opinion, (perfect should be the base word to speak on here)<br>  <br>  Some think it is perfectly sinless. <br>  It's perfect in love.<br>  A lot of us need to strive for.<br>  <br>  Don't you agree by the scriptures?|`|b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	You are correct.  When Jesus saved that prostitute, He told her to "sin no more".  Not to try to do your best.  <br>  <br>  Because our best isnt good enough.  We cant earn our way to Heaven.  We can be so good that God is obligated to let us in.<br>  <br>  But we failed. All of us.  Romans 3:23-for all have sinned and fallen SHORT of the glory of God.  <br>  <br>  So much for perfection.  And that's the whole point of Christianity, that we cant do it ourselves.  Enter Jesus.  He is perfect.  He is clean.  He is pure.  And He said it best, that He was the way, the truth and the life, and no one came to the Father except through Him.<br>  <br>  Because God is just, someone had to pay for all the screw-ups we did.  And Jesus did that.  The Lamb sacrificed Himself for us.  Not because He was somehow obligated, He wasnt.  But because He loved us so much.  It's all about God's love, and learning to love like Him and to live life for Him!  <br>  <br>  We are to follow Him, because of Him, we are allowed a second chance, a second life.  He, and only He can wash away our many sins and make us new, make us perfect in His eyes.|`|70c123af1cd3280ff233871ee1472e7eaa	Not sure but maybe since no one but Jesus can be perfect they mean that we should try our best to do so.  We are humans and will make mistakes and are by no means perfect.  I've never really heard it put that way in all my years of church but if churches are saying that - then maybe that's what they mean.  I cannot interpret God's word unless He reveals it through His Holy Spirit but that is just what I am assuming when people say "strive or try".  I might also be misunderstanding the question.  I am no bible scholar though - just a follower/believer. I do believe that the Lord gave us pastors to guide us and if they are guiding us wrong - then they will be held accountable.|`|uFAoq4idaa	There are no words as strive and try in the Scriptures because these words are conditional. God did not ask us to make conditional promises. Commitment is what He is asking from us.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Matt. 5;48 is not calling us to be perfect in all things. Read the verses before it.

4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	Matthew 24  tells us a lot....and very accurately. One has to wonder as to how wicked that pre-Flood world was for God to only have saved one family. <br>  <br>  Genesis 6: 5 The LORD saw how great man's wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time.<br>  <br>  According to Genesis, EVERY inclination of theirs was continually wicked.<br>  <br>  Matthew 24:3As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. "Tell us," they said, "when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" <br>  <br>   4Jesus answered: "Watch out that no one deceives you.<br>  <br>   5For many will come in my name, claiming, 'I am the Christ, and will deceive many. <br>  <br>  6You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. <br>  <br>  7Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. <br>  <br>  8All these are the beginning of birth pains. <br>  <br>   9"Then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations because of me. <br>  <br>  10At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other, <br>  <br>  11and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people. <br>  <br>  12Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, <br>  <br>  13but he who stands firm to the end will be saved. <br>  <br>  14And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. <br>  <br>   15"So when you see standing in the holy place 'the abomination that causes desolation, spoken of through the prophet Daniel‚Äîlet the reader understand‚Äî <br>  <br>  16then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. <br>  <br>  17Let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house. <br>  <br>  18Let no one in the field go back to get his cloak. <br>  <br>  19How dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers! <br>  <br>  20Pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the Sabbath. <br>  <br>  21For then there will be great distress, unequaled from the beginning of the world until now‚Äîand never to be equaled again. <br>  <br>  22If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened. <br>  <br>  23At that time if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or, 'There he is!' do not believe it. <br>  <br>  24For false Christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect‚Äîif that were possible. <br>  <br>  25See, I have told you ahead of time.<br>   <br>  36"No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son,but only the Father. <br>  <br>  37As it was in the days of Noah, so it will be at the coming of the Son of Man. <br>  <br>  38For in the days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, up to the day Noah entered the ark; <br>  <br>  39and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away.

He is "Eternal" ....<br>  <br>  With this in mind, we can see that God is able to see the beginning and end at the same time... your/our sins are visible to him before they happened, and continue to be visible for the remainder of time. <br>  <br>  So to answer your question...<br>  <br>  God being eternal and seeing the end at the beginning, has not changed his views or his opinion, or his plan. Only the natural world is bound by time, past/present/future.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Why, was there an agenda to get back into eden?|`|IqqaA2wIaa	He is pretty disgusted with the stupidity of humans.....HUMANS ARE STILL RUNNING THINGS SO WHOOPTIE WHOOP....PERFECTION OF HIS KINGDOM is not yet here....dont you get it?? if we repent, we can be part of it...|`|LZJPMl8raa	We are probably worst than before.

IVy35SE2aa	First I have to ask - where do your thoughts come from? Some <br>  people try for years to meditate and keep  extraneous thoughts<br>  from invading their consciousness.  Usually unsuccessfully.<br>  I think your duty is to sort those thoughts and only entertain<br>  the ones that agree with your ideals.<br>  <br>  If you have thoughts of inflicting bodily harm on another person<br>  or similar situation, you need to do some soul searching.<br>  Find the cause of those thoughts.  It looks like unforgiveness<br>  of some past deeds - real or imagined - that needs examination.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you were filled with sexual fantasies<br>  it might just be caused by raging hormones.  So what?|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	If thinking about killing someone gives you pleasure, you've got a mental health problem even if you wouldn't even act. It's not a normal thought to trigger pleasure.<br>  <br>  If it was something such as love for another person, when you're in a relationship, then it's still kind of wrong - your partner would still feel really hurt. It's just nowhere near as bad as the wrongdoing of actually cheating lol. <br>  <br>  So in some cases, thinking about doing something wrong can hurt someone almost as much as actually doing it, or it can signal mental health problems (if you're thinking about greviously harming someone... )|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	No, everyone thinks of things. We are only human. But remember that if you have actual URGES to get help. I think some pretty odd dark thoughts I'd never carry out that makes me smile. As long as your fully aware that what your thinking is something you would never actually do then it's just your mind. And we all get angry and frustrated. Also,Think of all the horror writers who would be very sinful if this were true. Many people watch horror movies for fun, they know it's all fake and just gives them a thrill of the story. If you ever start getting urges now that's something different...but you won't do what you're thinking so its just part of the millions of thoughts we have a day.|`|YLW7cEjkaa	Entertaining a thought about doing something in our head, giving it attention and turning it over in your mind, makes it easier to do.

Death should be seen as part of life (we will all die one die and then the day of judgment) which means that we need to be aware of it and to what is right in God's eyes. we do not fear it for we must die and be aware that we will be in Heaven when we do open our eyes on that special day.  God said we fear not man because he can take our life but fear He that can take our life and soul.  LIve a good life (not a sinful one) for death is ever present.|`|dR9UyP6naa	Depends on the type of fear you're talking about.

He should have the fear of knowing that if he doesn't do what he is ask, a whipping will be the discipline. But outside of that. No. <br>  A lot of people look at God as though we fear him. I do as I am ask so I do not worry about God doing anything to me because he is a Father only asking for me to do a few simple things. If I'm doing them, there is no need for fear. If I don't do them once or twice a week, still there is no need for fear. The fear comes in when you say bump it and decide not to do anything at all.|`|A01w1dHqaa	It's important to replace fear with love.

wD86088oaa	"Indoctrinated" is a loaded word. To suggest religious indoctrination, you add several connotations--one being "Charlie Manson cult." Being indoctrinated in to a society, family, education seems not to carry those connotations--you have no choice but to become part of your society, family or education--these institutions are forced on you via time and space. As for culture, I think if we took a poll describing what culture is to the individual we would get a different answer per person. But you might be right about the media. My grandparents never owned a television and they have a totally different view of the world than most people their age--and it does carry "Charlie Manson cult" like connotations. People have written, "I am addicted to the internet...I am addicted to Y!A..." and so on.

With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?  Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.  And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering.  All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.

7oCpSkmxaa	You're not stupid at all - that's a very logical question.  You are correct, there is a scripture that tells not to add or take away - Revelation 22:18-19.  And you are also correct that the Catholic church has usurped this.  They've made many changes to the Bible, not just adding extra books.  Most recently in the news, they want to remove God's actual name (tr: YHWH or JHVH) from the Bible.<br>  <br>  (For those who feel that I am bashing Catholics by saying this, my advice is: do some homework.  I'm not slandering anyone, I'm just pointing out facts.

First let me explain as most Protestants and some Catholics misread the ending of Revelation22:18 as it does not say the Bible but from this prophetic "book" meaning the book of revelation not the Bible. As for Protestants they came along 1500 yrs after the Catholic Church so where they have only a 600 yr history we have a 2100yr history so from that you should be able to decide who is using the more complete version of the Bible.As a former Protestant the only writing in the Catholic Version i have a problem with is the ending of Daniel with the story of Bel and the Dragon but then again i've never really read Catholic understanding on it either.But take some time and read Wisdom which is very much inspired .|`|TyRfv0eoaa	The Catholic Bible contains extra books in the OT.

It's human nature, people pick and chose what they want and interpret it to fit in with what they believe, that's why the Christian church is so divided and there are so many different denominations.|`|HMteUyRdaa	Martin Luther removed 7 books from the bible here is the original history of the bible. <br>  <br>  Pope Damasus assembled the first list of books of the Bible at the Roman Council in 382 A.D. He commissioned St.  Jerome to translate the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin, which became known as the Latin Vulgate the only authentic and official version, in 1546. <br>  * 7 Deutero-Canonical books, erroneously called "The Apocrypha", by some people were included in this.<br>  <br>  The DR New Testament was first published by the English College at Rheims in 1582 A.D.  The DR Old Testament was first published by the English College at Douay in 1609 A.D.  The first King James Version was not published until 1611.  This online DRV contains all 73 books, including the seven Deutero-Canonical books (erroneously called Apocrypha by Protestants).  These seven books were included in the 1611 KJV, but not in later KJV Bibles.  <br>  <br>  St. Jerome considered the seven Deutero-Canonical books to be NOT inspired by God, but he was commissioned by Pope Damasus to translate all 73 books into Latin. Pope Damasus considered the 7 DC books to be inspired by God. Later in 1946, after the finding of the dead-sea scrolls, it was discovered that these 7 DC books were used by the Jews in Alexandria, even in their services. This verifies that Pope Damasus was correct. <br>  <br>  It is interesting to note that the Palestinian Jews did not accept the 7 DC books for their version of Holy Scriptures and neither did they accept any of the New Testament. Unfortunately, the Protestants base their Bible on this version which comes from a people who did not accept Jesus Christ as the Messiah. <br>  <br>  The whole Douay-Rheims Bible was revised and diligently compared with the Latin Vulgate by Bishop Richard Challoner in 1749-1752 A.D.  The notes included in the text were written by Dr. Challoner. <br>  <br>  The DR Bible was photographically reproduced from the 1899 edition of the John Murphy Company, Baltimore, Maryland, by Tan Books in 1971.  Eventually, this edition was optically scanned to produce a large text file which this publisher used for creating this website, with the aid of text-processing software. <br>  <br>  One important goal of this project was to preserve the original text "as is", without making any changes in the wording, because the original text had the Imprimatur of James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, dated Sept 1st 1899.|`|13KBWzBXaa	As others have said, these books are knowns as The Apocrypha.<br>  <br>  Although "Jay" is one of my contacts, what she says is very offensive to me as Christian and I want to address it: The Book of Revelation (no "s") indeed says that nothing should be added nor taken away, yet the Protestants have taken away those books aforementioned! The Catholics didn't add any! The passage (translated into English says, "(KJV-1611)  For I testifie vnto euery man that heareth the wordes of the prophesie of this booke, If any man shal adde vnto these things, God shall adde vnto him the plagues, that are written in this booke."<br>  So if your Bible doesn't have these words spelled this way, I guess it's not a proper Bible. Interestingly enough, Baptists say the King James 1611 Bible is the only true Bible, and my quote above is directly from a 1611 KJV Bible. That Bible also has 12 books not found in the other King James.<br>  Also, Catholics do not pray to Mary as a deity, they pray she'll intercede on their behalf. This practice of praying for the dead and asking "saints" to pray for you is Biblical and not weird or wrong.<br>  <br>  Back to your question, there are some very good books within the Apocrypha. One of my favorites is Wisdom. It picks up where Psalms lets off. <br>  <br>  There's a great FREE Bible program out there.

But all the Fathers believed as did St. Athanasius, who, in one of his many Easter letters, names the 22 Books all Christians accept and then describes the deuterocanonicals as "appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who newly join us, and who wish for instruction in the word of godliness." Church Councils listed and affirmed the present Catholic canon, which was only formally closed at the Council of Trent in the 16th century.<br>  <br>  In the 16th century, Luther removed those books from the canon that lent support to orthodox doctrine, relegating them to an appendix.<br>  <br>  The Protestant "Reformers" decided against the canon held dear by the Apostles in favor of a canon determined by Pharisees some 40 years after Jesus rose from the dead -- the same Pharisees who denied the Truths of the entire New Testament, even accusing the "Nazarenes" of stealing Jesus' body from the tomb and lying to the world!<br>  <br>  And do you know why the Book of Maccabees was thrown out by the Jewish Council? Because the Council was conducted under the auspices of the Flavian Roman Emperors and they decided that that particuar book, which tells of the Maccabean Revolt, might be inflammatory and incite rebellion by the Jews. <br>  <br>  So, all those Protestant Bibles are lacking the Book of Maccabees, which speaks clearly of praying for the dead, because a pagan emperor pressured the Pharisees, around 40 years after the Resurrection of Christ, to exclude it.|`|AA10034051	The Bible as we know it dates from the Council of Rome, called by Pope Damasus in 382 AD, which decided on the number and order of the books that were to be accepted as Scripture. This was considered final by all the churches until 1520. The Bible therefore did not precede the Church, it was a creation of the Church.<br>  <br>  Luther's Next Problem<br>  <br>  Another problem immediately arose for Luther. Although many of his teachings (and those of the other Reformers) could be backed up from certain Bible passages, read in isolation, other Bible Books clearly refuted them. <br>  <br>  Luther, however, wanted a bible that agreed totally with his teachings. He disliked books in both the Old and New Testaments that disagreed with his teachings. He particularly disliked the New Testament Book of James, which condemned his teaching on Salvation by Faith Alone, (see Faith and Works), and the Old Testament Book of Maccabees, which advocated Prayer for the Dead, and therefore could be used to justify the doctrine of Purgatory. (see Heaven and Hell). He called the Book of James the "Epistle of Straw."<br>  <br>  Cutting Down the Bible.<br>  <br>  Luther therefore took the golden opportunity of his translation of the Bible into German to try to cut certain Books out of the Canon of Scripture. Of James he said, "I will not have him in my Bible in the number of truly principal works." He didn't dare remove books from the Bible entirely - that was too big a step for even him to take. What he did was to take them out of their accepted places in the Bible, and put them in a separate section, which he termed the Apocrypha(really called the Deuterocanicals). These books, he said, were not inspired by God, though they contained "many good sayings." (Luther‚Äôs Works, 35, 397) <br>  <br>  From the Old Testament he removed the Books of Judith, Tobit, 1 Maccabees 2 Maccabees, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus and Baruch, as well as Esther and part of the Book of Daniel.<br>  <br>  From the New Testament he removed the Books of Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation.<br>  <br>  What Authority Had He For This?<br>  <br>  None. One would have expected that the modification of the Bible, which all Christians hold as the highest authority, would have required at least a Council of the Church. But no such Council was held. Cleverly, Luther did not remove the books entirely, he merely sidelined them.<br>  <br>  In fact his fellow Protestants balked at removing books from the New Testament, particularly since there was no other reason for their removal than that they contradicted Luther's views. The four New Testament Books that Luther had placed in the Apocrypha, were reinserted in future Protestant Bibles, along with most of Esther. But if Luther had had his way, Hebrews, James, Jude, and Revelation would not be in Protestant Bibles.<br>  <br>  Seven Old Testament Books, however, remained excluded from Protestant Bibles. Initially the seven Books continued to be placed in a section called the Apocrypha. But since it was cheaper to print bibles without them, the seven books were slowly dropped altogether. By the 19th Century, the vast majority of Protestant Bibles did not carry the seven Books at all. Protestants began to get used to not seeing these Books in their Bibles, and to imagine that their Bibles were perfectly complete without them.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	In first century Jerusalem there were at least four OT Canons in use by different Jewish Groups. There was the Canon of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Ethiopian Jews and the Diaspora/Essene Jews. Jesus and the disciples used the Septuagint which was the Canon of the Diaspora/Essenes. We know this because it is quoted in the New Testament. This Canon continued to be the Canon of Christians until after the Reformation and, in fact until about 200 years ago when the Protestants adopted a condensed version of the Canon eliminating the Deuterocanonicals from their Bibles. Even the AKJ originally contained the complete Christian Canon. It has been said by critics of Christ‚Äôs Church that the Deuterocanonicals were never believed to be inspired and just the opposite is true. The decision by Christians as to which books are inspired and useful for teaching was decided at the African Synods in the late fourth and early fifth century. There was never a question about their inspiration. <br>  <br>  The OT Canon chosen by the Protestants is actually a Jewish Canon not chosen by the Jews until after the establishment of Christianity as a result of the spread of Christianity to slow the growth of the new group in Jerusalem after the fall of the Temple in 70AD. Until then as I said previously there were many Canons in use. The adoption of the Canon missing the Deuterocanonicals united the Jews against the Christians was decided in the Jewish Council of Jamnia because the Deuterocanonicals referred too strongly to the Messiah fulfilled in Christ. <br>  <br>  Some Protestants will claim that only the Jews have the authority to choose Canon but the Church deferred that decision to Christ and the disciples and it is clear through biblical research, that the Septuagint is the Bible used by the first century Church and quoted in the NT Scriptures. The fact that Protestants choose to adopt the Canon that was approved by the same Jews that accused our Lord that resulted in His crucifixion suggests the source of this confusion as from the father of lies who led the Pharisees to accuse Christ and petition for His punishment. It is another way that Satan divides the body of Christ and separates the faithful denying Christ‚Äôs prayer that we all be one in Christ through His Church. The Christian Church has always used the Septuagint as Canon and never the truncated version of modernist Protestants.<br>  <br>  Some Protestants erroneously believe that Catholics added to the Bible with the Deuterocanonicals but this shows an ignorance of their own history and the history of Christianity as witnessed by Christ‚Äôs Church. The facts are that the Protestants removed the Deuterocanonicals and even considered strongly to remove some of the NT books currently in use by Protestants and Catholics. Fr. Martin Luther was in favor of removing the book of James because it conflicted with His heretical man made doctrines of the ‚ÄúSolas‚Äù, Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide. The heretic Ulrich Zwingli wanted to remove the Gospel of John because of its teaching of the commandment to Eat Christ‚Äôs Body and drink His Blood which contradicted his view of a real absence of Christ instead of a real presence in the Eucharist. Even Fr. Martin Luther could not endorse such a departure from Scriptures and deny that Christ is truly and really present in the Eucharist in Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity. <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph<br>  <br>  Note:<br>  <br>  In Revelations St. John instructs not to add to His revelation and not the Canon. The Canon was not even assembled until several centuries later at the Africam Synods in Hippo and Carthage.<br>  <br>  Note:<br>  <br>  The Council of Nicea had nothing to do with the Canon of Scriptures. They assembled to confront the heresy of Arianism.<br>  <br>  Note:<br>  <br>  Teh seven books removed from the Christian Canon by Protestants are properly called Deuterocanonicals and not apocrypha. The apocrapha books were banned by Pope St. Gelasius in the fifth century and these were mainly Gnostic writings.|`|FvoxgjbJaa	Where do you think the Bible came from? The canon of the Bible was decided by St. Augustine who along with a few episcopal synods submitted their list to the Pope for final approval. So the 73 books remained until the archheresiarch Luther removed 7 books and placed them in an appendix. In 1826 these seven books were removed forever by Protestant heretics who feel closer to their Jewish brothers in faith--the Scribes and Pharisee--whom Jesus condemned.<br>  <br>  For the first 300 years of Christianity, there was no Bible as we know it today. Christians had the Old Testament Septuagint, and literally hundreds of other books from which to choose. The Catholic Church realized early on that she had to decide which of these books were inspired and which ones weren't. The debates raged between theologians, Bishops, and Church Fathers, for several centuries as to which books were inspired and which ones weren't. In the meantime, several Church Councils or Synods, were convened to deal with the matter, notably, Rome in 382, Hippo in 393, and Carthage in 397 and 419. The debates sometimes became bitter on both sides. One of the most famous was between St. Jerome, who felt the seven books were not canonical, and St. Augustine who said they were. Protestants who write about this will invariably mention St. Jerome and his opposition, and conveniently omit the support of St. Augustine. I must point out here that Church Father's writings are not infallible statements, and their arguments are merely reflections of their own private opinions. When some say St. Jerome was against the inclusion of the seven books, they are merely showing his personal opinion of them. Everyone is entitled to his own opinion. However, A PERSONS PRIVATE OPINION DOES NOT CHANGE THE TRUTH AT ALL. There are always three sides to every story, this side, that side, and the side of truth. Whether Jerome's position, or Augustine's position was the correct position, had to be settled by a third party, and that third party was the Catholic Church.|`|msNXomjTaa	The Bible is not a book, but a collection of books.  There is disagreement on which books are truly God inspired, and what is just really good theological writing.  These differences are not large, in the grand scheme of things - the extra books are a few pages, or simply a few paragraphs added to existing ones.  There are also books that were used by the Church fathers that have now been lost.  The Gospel to the Hebrews is something scholars would love to get their hands on!<br>  <br>  Many English Bibles are based on the "Authorized Version," which is usually known as the King James Version. This is the one with 66 books.  Many fundamentalist Protestants consider this the only true Bible, despite it's problems.  Roman Catholics base their translations on the Latin Vulgate, which is apparently still their "official" version, despite it's own difficulties.<br>  <br>  Anglicans recognize the 66 books as the main part of the Bible, but also the Apocrypha, which are the extra bits, known as Pseudo-Canonical by Roman Catholics.   Anglicans consider it Biblical, although no doctrine is bases solely on material found there.<br>  <br>  The Orthodox churches also have slightly different versions.<br>  <br>  Many people thing the Bible was dictated word for word by God.  However, which the Bible is the Word of God, it is NOT the Words of God.  They are quite different things!

Other Bibles are missing seven books. The Catholic Bible includes the seven deuterocanonical books. These books were in use by the Alexandrian Jews, and for this reason, were in the Septuagint. The Septuagint was used by early Christians such as the Church Fathers. Part of these seven deuterocanonical Bibles have been found in Qumran (The Dead Sea Scrolls).<br>  <br>  You may want to look at the Douay-Rheims Bible.

They were always part of the Bible from when the OT and the NT was assembled in the 4th century into the complete Bible as it is known today.  Martin Luther removed those books in the 15th century.  They are not in the Jewish canon because during the time of Christ, there was no Jewish Canon.  It was not until after Jerusalem was sacked did Jewish leaders meet (around 90 AD) and decide on their canon (which is the OT that is in Protestant Bibles).  This same council of Jewish leaders condemned Christ and the fast growing Christianity.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	Whatever books of the LXX (Septuagint) that are not part of the Hebrew Bible,  the Protestants call Apocrypha, meaning "hidden."  Anything   outside of the LXX, Protestants call Pseudepigrapha,    meaning "false writings."        <br>  <br>  Catholics call the books accepted by the Jews Protocanonical,    meaning the "first canon."  The others listed form the    Deuterocanonical books, the "second canon".  All the rest they    call Apocrypha.        <br>  <br>  The Orthodox follow suit but have additional books in the list of    Deuterocanonicals.  Anything not found in the LXX is called    Apocrypha.<br>  <br>  Concerning the Books of TOBIAS, JUDITH, WISDOM, ECCLESIASTICUS, and MACHABEES.<br>  <br>  PROTESTANTS and other Sectaries of this time deny these Books to be Divine Scripture, because they are not in the Jews Canon, nor were accepted for canonical in the primitive Church. But in deed the chief cause is, for that some things in these Books, are so manifest against their opinions, that they have no other answer, but to reject their authority. An old shift noted and refuted by St. Augustine touching, the Book of Wisdom, which some refused, pretending that it was not canonical, but in deed because it convinced their errors. For otherwise who seeth not, that the Canon of the Church of Christ is of more authority with all true Christians, then the Canon of the Jews? And that the Church of Christ numbereth these Books amongst others of Divine and infallible authority, is evident by the testimony and definition, not only of later general Councils; of Trent, Sess. 4. and Florence Instructione Armenorum, of Pope Innocentius, Epist ad Exuperium, and Gelasius, Decreto de libris sacris; but also the Council of Carthage. An. Dom. 419. St. Augustine lib. 2 Doct. Christ. cap. 8. Isidorus lib. 6. Etymol. cap. 1. Cassidorus lib. 1. Diuinarum Lectionum. Rabanus, lib. 2. de Institutione Clericorum, and others testify the same, as we shall further note severally of every book, in their particular places. And for so much as our adversaries acknowledge these Books to be Holy, and Worthy to be read in the Church, but not sufficient to prove, and confirm points of faith: the studious reader may consider that the Council of Carthage calleth them Canonical, and Divine, which showeth that they are of infallible authority. For a Canon is an assured rule and warrant of direction, whereby (saith St. Augustine lib. 11. contra Faustum. cap. 5. and lib. 2. contra Cresconium. cap. 32.) the infirmity of our defect in knowledge is guided, and by which rule other Books are likewise known to be Gods word. His reason is, because we have no other assurance that the Books of Moyses, the four Gospels, and other Books are the true word of God, but by the Canon of the Church. Whereupon the same great Doctor uttered that famous saying: that he would not believe the Gospel, except the authority of the Catholic Church moved him thereunto. contra. Epist. Fundamenti. ca. 5.<br>  <br>  True it is that some Catholic Doctors doubted whether these Books were Canonical or no, because the Church had not then declared that they were; but since the Churches declaration no Catholic doubteth. So St. Jerome testifieth, that the Book of Judith (among the rest) seemed to him not canonical, till the Council of Nice declared it to be. Likewise the Epistle to the Hebrews, the Epistle of St. James, the second of St. Peter, the second and third of St. John, St. Judes Epistle, and the Apocalypse were sometimes doubted of, yet were afterwards declared to be Canonical. And most Protestants, namely English admit them all, as the assured word of God, though they were not always so reputed by all, but as St. Jerome affirmeth of St. James Epistle, Paulatim tempore procedente meruit authoritatem. By little and little in process of time merited authority.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	You actually have a very valid question. <br>  <br>  The fact is, that neither side actually added or took away.

They were included in a Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures which was developed by the Greek-speaking Jewish community in Alexandria, Egypt.  One reason for some concern about them is that only the Greek translations were available, not the Hebrew originals, and the translation process cannot be fully trusted.<br>  <br>  Roman Catholics regard those books as "deutero-canonical," part of Scripture, but not to be used as a primary source of doctrine, especially if an idea cannot be supported from any other part of Scripture.  Protestants regard them as outside the canon of Scripture.  Still, many study Bibles from Protestant publishers contain those books, referred to as the Apocrypha.<br>  <br>  What is clear about those books is that the writers of the New Testament, writing in Greek, had access to them and occasionally quote from them (and even from some other books which were included in the Greek version I mentioned above, and which nobody considers to be part of Scripture.)  They can be of value to serious students of Scripture, regardless of denomination.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons Jewish scholars later rejected those books is the translation problem I mentioned above.  Another reason is that they present many of the themes that lead into New Testament thinking, such as a heavy concern with the end times similar to the New Testament Book of Revelation.  The rabbis thought those books might persuade Jews to become Christians!<br>  <br>  So, whether one accepts or rejects those books does not make him or her any more or less Christian.  They are valuable because they help us see the religious environment in which Jesus and the early church lived.  No one takes them as a central source of doctrine, and most Christian doctrine is derived from the New Testament, and there are no variations between Catholic and Protestant as to the books of the New Testament.<br>  <br>  You may have heard of some "lost Gospels" such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Nicodemas or the Gospel of Judas.

Unfortunately, such is not always the case and many people simply go through the motions of the ritual of signing themselves without a knowledge of why they do it. A final analysis of the sign of the cross is that it is by no means required of Christians because it is not instructed by the Word of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Matthew 10:38<br>  and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.<br>  <br>  Matthew 16:24<br>  Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.<br>  <br>  What does these two scriptures above mean?:<br>  <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/take-up-your-cross.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotquestions.org/take-up-your...</a><br>  <br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  Question: "Should a Christian wear religious jewelry?"<br>  <br>  Answer: There is much debate as to whether or not it is appropriate‚Äîor even sinful‚Äîto wear crosses and crucifixes as jewelry. Christians did not begin wearing crosses around their necks until after crucifixion was no longer the primary source of capital punishment; therefore, it is not equivalent to a modern-day person wearing a miniature death chamber around his neck, as some have suggested. Many look at the cross as simply the instrument of death used to slay our beloved Savior. Because it was God's will, Jesus willingly went to the cross, taking upon Himself the sins of the world, cleansing those who believe in Him of their own sins.<br>  <br>  The only reason Scripture would forbid wearing a cross or crucifix would be if the object became an idol used for worship (1 Corinthians 10:14) or if the wearer were consumed with how the jewelry made her look (1 Peter 3:3). Many people wear the cross or crucifix as a fashion piece without concern for its symbolism or a desire to represent Christ. But that should not mean Christians can't or shouldn‚Äôt wear them. Many Christians wear crosses as a proud expression of their love, respect, and service to Christ, along with a remembrance of what He did for us.<br>  <br>  Another concern is when people allow objects such as crosses, crucifixes, figurines, rosaries, bumper stickers, etc., to take the place of the true change that should take place in our hearts. The things we wear, carry, or put on our cars are not what make us Christians. God is not concerned with what we wear as long as we do not dress in a way that would cause anyone to stumble in his or her walk with God (Romans 14:20) and we are not absorbed with our looks or our possessions. He is searching out our hearts to find who is faithful to Him and whether we encourage and show love to others. It is not for any of us to judge whether wearing a cross is proper or not; every Christian has to seek God's approval in all he does. If it is not clearly outlined in Scripture whether a practice is lawful or edifying, then the practice is one better left to each person‚Äôs conscience.|`|iJVzfJRVaa	christians dont wear it..catholics do...ihave been to a billion christian churches and noone wears that junk....ONLY CATHOLICS!! lol symbolizes t for turtle lol|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Doesn't it make you wonder why 'christians' wear the cross around their neck with their 'savior' was crucified on it?

3KD6RRhPaa	Just had them in my home for 3 hours. I let them speak and then asked them if they still had sin even though they believed in God. They were decent guys, and were honest with me and before God. They said that they did have sins. <br>  So I asked them, if they were born again. And to this they said yes. But I asked, how is this possible, if you came into my home and told me that Jesus took all our sins away a moment ago, and then here in my midst you deny it, and confirm that you still have sin? They were totally stymied!!!    I asked them why Jesus was baptized? They could not tell me why. So this gave me the opportunity to share with them the true and original gospel Jesus gave to mankind, explaining to them the sacrificial system as set by God, how the Israelites were forgiven their sins on the Day of Atonement. And how this likeness was played out in the NT by Jesus' water baptism by John the Baptist the last earthly high priest and His shed blood on the Cross.  It took me about 3 hours of explaining this true gospel for they were filled up with complete nonsense. But just 30 minutes ago the light of the true gospel dawned upon them, and they accepted this gospel and cast their rubbish, notions and thoughts away.   They arrived at my door with garbage, thinking they were pure in their own eyes, but were never cleansed from their filthiness. And left truly born again and righteous children of God. Only now are they spreading the truth that God requires of us and not the devils lies.<br>  <br>  And I am exhausted!!!<br>  <br>  Here, you too can meet this powerful and original gospel by going to www.bjnewlife.org|`|uK3tkaOJaa	I always invite them in and feed them.

We are not as generous or kind here.  <br>  <br>  I think that all those who profess to believe in Jesus Christ ought to be inviting them in, and being kind to them.  Even if you choose to not believe what they want to share with you, that they are there far from home and paying for their missions out of their own pocket to bring you a message that they believe in deserves respect.<br>  <br>  I think that most Americans are kinder to the vacuum cleaning salesman than the missionaries who are out trying to serve their church and their God.|`|KILFoc6kaa	Point to my no trespassing sign...By the way I would do that to ANYone who ignored my no trespassing sign.|`|ucuP0boCaa	Invite them in.

The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband also gives authority over his body to his wife. So do not deprive each other of sexual relations.

Through a program that I like watching, <<Caso Cerrado>> there was an expert of the mayans and he also said it was a hearsay.  <br>  <br>  I believe that if the world ends it would be do because us humans didn't take care of the Earth and this is why we need to be aware about not contaminating the planet with nuclear waste.  We also need to be aware of natural resources  this is why need to be aware of overpopulation and deforestation.|`|LgFPe6x6aa	to be honest, i really hope so.|`|1U9YtSW3aa	Predictions have been made of several events that some Christians believe are related: the second coming of Jesus, the war of Armageddon, the arrival on earth of the Antichrist, the Tribulation, the Rapture, some horrendous natural disaster, etc.  Jewish, Islamic, psychic and occult predictions have also been offered as well. past predictions of the end of the world which have one factor in common: none ever came true. There is every likelihood that most (perhaps all) of the future predictions will not materialize either.<br>  I believe that God has not told us the exact year of the beginning of the end-times period in order that there wouldn't be so many crazy people doing crazy things.

This is one of the most encouraging posts I've ever read.  Your thoughtfulness for your friend and your open-mindedness in an age of bigotry is truly a miracle, or as we Muslims sometimes say, MashAllah!  I say wear it as long as you want and as long as you like!  The decision is up to you--what you do is between you and God, so don't let anyone tell you different.  Just follow what your heart says.  No matter what, be confident in knowing you did a great service to your friend and that if more people behaved as you did Earth would be a truly amazing place.<br>  <br>  May God guide you and may you find the path that you are destined for, and peace be with you!|`|MTKAU92haa	First of all, Wow! that's really sweet of you. <br>  Second, Muslims don't wear hijab to get attention. Actually, hijab is not just the headcovering, but a full way of dressing(like not wearing really tight clothes or minskirts or see-through stuff). Muslims girls wear hijab because then others don't just notice them for their body, but for the person that they are. <br>  Thirdly, if you love wearing it then wear it! A lot of nonmuslims wear hijab because the actual concept of it is beautiful. <br>  :)<br>  And once again, that's a really cool thing to do for your friend! I hope she finds the strength to continue doing what she believes despite other people's nasty comments.

vtFDRfdzaa	If this attitude is not directed at you personally ignore it. Your team leader will become aware of it on their own. You don't serve your career well by being the office tattle tale. I find that when people are nasty to me it is very satisfying to engage them in conversation as often as possible and laugh when they try to get under my skin. It really drives them nuts that they can't ruin your day with their poison and in short order they give up entirely.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Distance yourself.. and maybe try talking to her when you get some time !|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Firstly, I would talk to your other co-workers and ask them if they feel the same way. Then, I would talk to the lady and say "I have a problem with some of your behaviour in the office." Make sure you say it's your problem and not hers, so she doesn't feel threatened and doesn't scream and yell at you. Explain to her kindly what your problem is and how you can feel more comfortable at work. Explain that you would like to have a nice relationship with her at work instead of one full of tension. If she doesn't change her way or if she gets offended and annoyed, just either completley ignore her or be nasty back! :P|`|yk4S7uuraa	Don't respond to her in any way, if you do, she'll be twice as bad.<br>  <br>  Also, don't ever go to your team leader or supervisor, about any other employees, they should be able to see the problem themselves.

Shes not your leader so you dont have to listen to her.

I suggest telling her directly in a calm assertive manner that everyone here is equal. The problem with doing this is that nasty people are just bully's and you may have to let know in no uncertain terms you will not allow her to mess you around at times we have to lower our selves to another level give her some of her own medicine. People like this never last long in one job ask her if she has had many jobs i bet she has and if she told you why she left it would be her behaviour.

So, of course they are going to discourage them from having anything to do with non-believers, to the point of demonizing them.

I would be happy to believe in God if only it made any sense. Religious people look at the beauty of nature, coincidence and the unexplainable and then extrapolate God; atheists look at evidence and deduce. <br>  <br>  You cannot generalize all atheists and put them in these simplistic categories. <br>  <br>  I love this verse, 2:13..... I believe the exact opposite. Why should I believe because others believe it? That truly is foolishness. <br>  <br>  Of course, because you believe these verses prop up your belief. They seem to validate what you believe because they are describing people who oppose the very foundation of your religion, the very existence of God. But the fact that it can accurately describe unbelievers proves nothing. Unbelievers will always, by definition, NOT believe. <br>  <br>  And btw, if God came down and spoke to me, I would believe. He's God, he would know how to do it. Instead, he wants me to play mind games with myself and release the intelligent use of my mind which he supposedly gave me???? Poppycock!

Most Christians are not the way you described.  Perhaps the most obnoxious ones are the ones you encounter on the internet because no one is willing to talk with them in person.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons America produces a surplus of people who are what you call "false prophets" is because we, as a nation, place a very high value on freedom of communication.  We let people say and write the most outrageous nonsense without throwing them in jail,  and usually without even making them pay a significant social price of being treated as outcasts.    This is good in many ways,  but it encourages many people to behave irresponsibly.   <br>  <br>  I hope you don't think we are all like you described.  Perhaps you will get to visit America some day.  It's a great place to visit - and to live.

AA11820705	Well, there was pederasty in greece. a young man is assigned to an older gentleman in the army, and same sex play was encouraged, as it was seen to form stronger bonds among people who have to fight together (because you would fight for someone you've had sex with if you kinda like them). Also, Zeus;king of the gods, had sex with ganymede, a male. he thought he was a woman...but he diddled him anyway... <br>  <br>  In ancient rome, having sex with a male slave wasn't seen as bad either, just getting your rocks off really...until christianity hit them, and it all went to ****.<br>  <br>  EVERY CULTURE HAS ACCEPTED HOMOSEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS UNTIL AN ABRAHAMIC RELIGION CAME AND ****** IT UP FOR EVERYBODY.<br>  <br>  and for those of you who do not know what an Abrahamic religion is, it's the three large religions coming out of the middle east(Islam, Christianity, and Judaism)...seriously, there are depictions of male/male relationships in japan during one of their earlier eras...|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Somewhat.<br>  <br>  Many people cite ancient civilizations like Greece and Japan, but I want to point out some important aspects to remember:<br>  <br>  In these societies, the homosexual relationships that were accepted and encouraged were often older male/younger male (sometimes pedophilic, sometimes not).  Usually the older male was a mentor of some type to the younger, and they had a close bond that was expected to spill over into sexual relations.  Same-sex love between adults of the same age was less prevalent by far.<br>  <br>  Also, these societies weren't exactly all for every type of love.  Society was strictly hierarchical, and men and women were meant to get married to the opposite sex and have children.  If you wanted to have a happy life with a same-sex partner, it wasn't going to happen.  Same-sex lovers on the side were okay; not living a heterosexual lifestyle was not an option the way it is today.<br>  <br>  And as for lesbianism, while it certainly happened, wasn't very tolerated.  Women had few rights in ancient times and weren't seen as autonomous; there was no sanctioning of lesbian relationships the way there were for male homosexual relationships.|`|JhEboCmDaa	Ancient Greece and Rome, Japan, China, Africa and the Americas.

2pNHOCONaa	wow. i used to be like you before. but youre right for feeling that you do not want to be fake, AND that it apparently offends people most of the time or almost always. its a dilemma. and its awesome to have someone ask this.<br>  <br>  what i have come to realize is, there is really no point in being blunt if its not helping the person anyway. and when we tell it as it is without much thought about how the person would feel if we told him/her what we feel is the horrible truth about them, it will be, more or less, be like an attack. instead of an advice.<br>  <br>  being blunt, being tactless is also another way of being thoughtless. what we think is wrong if we dont tell it as it is, is that its as good as were lying right? but thats not really the point, the point is supposed to be that we told our truth in a way that who were telling it to would understand. and there are Countless ways to telling our opinions. when someone does something wrong, and we literally announce it in front of everyone that YOURE WRONG! This is Right! youre embarrassing him/her. what we need to do is to stop, and think about how we would like someone to tell us when were wrong, if it would insult us/embarrass us or would it open our minds and we would understand that were just trying to help. this pausing, and thinking? and not being so blunt, this is called Composure. and theres nothing wrong with composure. its not so bad to pause and think about what we felt and thought, before actually saying or doing them. its simply prolonging it that we would be more kinder rather than just Honest but rude.<br>  <br>  and its better if we talk to the person in person, and in the most thoughtful and loving manner.<br>  <br>  i have lost friends before because of this. and there arent much benefit to being tactless, so im happy someone actually got concerned enough to ask this :) Good luck to you! and remember, you are not your thoughts and emotions, those are separate from you. who you are is what you choose to do with those thoughts and emotions..<br>  <br>  and A common rule of thumb says that any difficult new habit becomes second nature after only three weeks. so keep at it! before you know it, you wont even notice how good youve become :)|`|K4GiKOhPaa	There's blunt, and then there's downright rude.

A bit of pride. Or dysfunction and maybe a bit of ego and social terrorism. <br>  <br>  And atheists... well, a lot of atheists are religious fanatics among themselves.  It really isn't an oxymoron.  Quibbling over semantics or being so vehemently anti-religious they can't even have a rational conversation about their own beliefs - which comes down to the question atheism is to question scientology.... Well, not exactly.

JL8KpDYnaa	yes, but all the more reason you need to do it.  He knew what a rotten wretch you are and still created you anyhow, that's amazing!|`|35b3dfccb02ddb35095a8a5a20eb69e9aa	God is all knowing and knows what we will do and what every single cell and creature in the whole universe will do but Human being are the only creatures unlike animals, angels and any other creatures. God gave us our own will we can do what ever we want, but at the same time he gave us the rules and commands in the devin books he sent through the prophets to show us the righteousness in our life and how we should act and if we choose some thing else rather than that, then crimes will spread in the whole world, but there is always who believe in him and so the crimes in the faithful communities are very less and in the communities that has corrupted scriptures or does not believe in the one truly one god or does not submit to him you will find the corruption in most of its aspects.|`|2zYCQX9saa	Yes, God knew ahead of time of everything. He even knew that Adam would sin, that is why The Lamb was slain from BEFORE the foundation of the cosmos (world). The provision for Adam's transgression was already provided before he was created!<br>  <br>  God 'allows' killing and he allows some to live long happy lives. But, they ALL die. Every person Jesus ever prayed for, died! Death is no big deal to God who is Life. God is bringing everyone back; and through Jesus we will all live eternally. What's objectionable about that?|`|H9pGPjNHaa	Supposedly, we acquired free will after Eve ate the apple. Personally, I'm more worried about whether or not they'll be serving Bacardi 151 in Hell. And yes, it is a game. God is jerking you around because he loves you...he loves you like the filthy masochist he made you to be. Take Jesus' throbbing love member.|`|7Ruzpu2Uaa	God did not allow. It is just trhat there is freewill. If God had a hand with your doings, then you could not say that you were free to do it. On the other hand, be it as that is, still, if you ask God for something, He may cause it to happen, not as an interference with your life, but as a granting for your wish in your prayer.|`|FSfDD2Qcaa	Yes god knows everything we ever will do because he doesn't perceive time the way we do.  To him everything is happening at the same time, past present future, it's all one big potluck of dates to him.  He allows us to commit the sins we do to test us, see if we will make the right decision.  It is unfortunate so many in this world don't care about him.|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	God doesn't make someone kill, or make someone make a bad choice in life.   He may know they will be tempted to kill.  But each person has free will to choose good or evil.  <br>  <br>  God allows us to choose because he respects and loves us.  If you love someone you don't control all their actions.  You allow them to make mistakes and learn and grow.  <br>  <br>  Your parent loves you, but you still fall on your face.  Your parent can't protect you every minute of your life, or make all your decisions for you. To enslave you like that would be cruel, wouldn't it?  Your parent respects your personhood enough to allow you the freedom to make a mistake.  It's the same with God.
h1XcYcJ7aa	I remember all of those and quite a few more. That must be from stories I was told 'cause I can't be that old. <br>  Do you remember the annoying black line that went from the top of the screen to the bottom on a bad day? No reruns because it was live programing and the mistakes were the best part of the show. If it wasn't funny, no one laughed because it was a live audience? All the entertainment was G. Even Elvis was filmed from the waist up. The commercials were as funny as the show. Uncle Milty was the tops, a cross dresser and no one worried about it. Jack Benny had perfect timing and could play the violin like no one you ever wanted to hear. That was special effects. Everyone could sit down and watch the same programs.<br>  <br>  We didn't have school lunches. Mom made them at home, wraped in wax paper and put in a brown paper bag. Usually there was a real homemade cookie and you could trade if you didn't like what you had. We had homemade bread on those sandwiches. For awhile we had to put oleo on our bread instead of butter. You mixed it with this little bead of food color and turned it a little more yellow than butter. We had milk at school in glass bottles and delivered at home by the milk man in glass bottles. It never seemed to be spoiled. Some kid was always allergic to milk and you stayed away from him or her at lunch because we had to eat the food we were given.Eggs were delivered too and never seemed to be spoiled. Really had an orange colored "yellow" to them. Excitement was going to the ice cream store to get hand scooped ice cream and they would wrap it up in dry ice and newspaper and walk it home.<br>  Mom wore an apron. The table cloths were made of oil cloth and you can still remember the smell today. You were usually the dishwasher with your sibling and the game of choice was trying to hit each other with a damp dish cloth, unless you had permission to air dry them. We all ate at the table at the same time. We always had time for grace. We had to ask permission to leave the table.<br>  We frequently had a surprise "lights out" when the fuse blew. Very frequently when the Christmas tree went up. We always thanked mom for cooking and God for providing. <br>  We lived in the city and walked to school about five miles, no kidding. We wore snow pants, boots, wool coats and smelled like moth balls in the fall. We didn't have a car very often but the gas was 30c/gal. We had to use ration stamps, we had to wear skirts to school as girls, boys wore wash pants with belts. We got dressed up for church every Sunday and everyone knew your name so it was hard to get into a lot of trouble. Every Sunday, Dad would sit us on his lap and read us the comics. If we ever c/o being bored, mom had plenty for us to do,so we stayed away from saying that.  It was a good time. You knew you were loved.|`|OUBuIKDMaa	I'm only 26 so I'm not young enough to remember any of that but I do know that all this paranoia about health and germs these days is weakening our immune systems because we are taking over the counter and prescription drugs..oh..excuse me..."medications"...for EVERYTHING these days, including things that our bodies would fight off if we were just patient enough to allow them to instead of always seeking the quick fix.|`|zww9zToNaa	LMAO....I understand completely.

cPQ7TBcuaa	Satanist are people that just look to fulfill their own fleshly desires regardless of whether they are "right" or "wrong". They don't actually believe in Satan, they are atheists. I tend to look down on those people if you want the honest truth. They tend to be irresponsible liabilities to society, in my honest opinion.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh...I don't really study that deep into that stuff. I have known a couple of self-proclaimed Satanists and this is just what I've learned from them.|`|283tO9j9aa	I know quite a bit about LaVeyan Satanism, and it does appeal. It does seem to be trolling in the form of an entire religion though... maybe that's why I like it. The rules are certainly a lot more sensible than your average religion- I think it's more important to think for yourself and not be a prick or hurt people than to make sure you're worshipping the right god.<br>  <br>  I don't know a lot about Theistic Satanism. All I know is that worshipping the devil makes about as much sense as worshipping gods to me.|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	i think its scary and its something that in my opinion people should not being playing around with and its just beyond evil<br>  <br>  but overall im a tolerant person and i accept other peoples beliefs and i never discriminate for that would be the wrong thing to do|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	There are also Theistic Satanists, who worship an actually deity they call Satan, not just the atheistic LeVeyan kind.|`|C9QQPROkaa	Don't know that much about it but i know one thing i get tired of people confusing wicca with satanism its insulting.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	I know it's about sef worship. Basically a religion dedicated to sociopaths.|`|wTmNCQhcaa	I'm a theistic Satanism, and yeah we don't worship the christian "devil." Theistic Satanism is very broad and there is no one central belief. I believe in a powerful spirit that many, perhaps all, human cultures have encountered. Some have been terrified by him, others have embraced him. Obviously, the christians rejected him and believed he was the evil opponent of their god. He is an adversarial spirit and asks that we challenge everything we know about our world. So, in a way, he IS the opponent of the christian religion... but it's much broader than that.<br>  <br>  We generally take from eclectic sources of religious and occult practices. I'm a big fan of meditation and study. It's not a religion like christianity where you just accept someone as your savior and live your life as normal... it actually requires you do ****. Unfortunately, there are lazy Satanists as there are lazy people in any walk of life.<br>  <br>  <br>  www.joyofsatan.org is a good place for info. Some theistic satanists hate the organization because of far-right views expressed by the founder and their acceptance of the existence of extraterrestrials. But, they are a large group and the site probably has more info than any other spiritual satanist website out there.|`|OqiscVF7aa	LaVeyan Satanists who actually take the practice seriously are fools. LaVey himself admitted that his Satanism was a farce.<br>  <br>  As for theistic Satanists...<br>  <br>  As is the case with all deists, these polluters of the occult perpetuate self-delusion in order to free themselves from responsibility and rigorous study in the arcane.|`|K5RZlE4jaa	LeVeyan Satanists are people who don't believe in Satan but they chose the name Satan because its etymology means adversary or accuser. They don't believe in Satan as a god but rather worship themselves as a god. Their main beliefs are individualism, eye for an eye, hedonism, and self indulgence. I know some people who are LeVeyan Satanists and I agree with some of their beliefs.<br>  I don't know much about Theistic Satanism except that some of them don't worship the Satan/Devil in Christianity but rather gods from other pre-Christian religions.|`|CLCSL042aa	it spoke me and I am afraid of evil spirits, don't play with them rather join a art class or get out and meet new people

You could have bothered to strip the footnote that changed the Whirlpool Galaxy from M51 to "M51.2".<br>  <br>  That said, the galaxies are not static, isolated systems.  Big galaxies eat small galaxies and they tug on each other.  There are a number of close companion galaxies to the Milky Way, such as the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy.  There is a large companion galaxy to M51 -- NGC 5195.  Creationists conveniently ignore these facts.  Creationists use false models to get false results.

I'll take your question seriously the second you can explain anything you just said.|`|f7l3Y8Ybaa	allah akbar|`|bDUNBvKbaa	That's a question that might have been valid in 1900, but certainly is not today. <br>  First: God doesn't exist. <br>  Second: We know dark matter, which makes up over 90% of the matter in the universe, to exist. Basically, it has mass, and thus, by virtue of being diffused throughout the Galaxy, holds it in its present shape like a cosmic glue, because it exerts gravitational force on matter surrounding it, preventing from forming a featureless disk.<br>  Third: this question has nothing whatsoever to do with Evolution.<br>  There is an abundance of evidence as to the age of the universe, such as the cosmic microwave background.|`|gQEFy4BVaa	Cite your sources!<br>  I see no reason to think that density waves are 'fine-tuned'.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wav...</a><br>  <br>  It should also be noted that density wave theory has successfully been applied to Saturn's rings.<br>  <br>  The universe is 13.7 billion years old, not millions. It actually says that in your question, as if it wasn't obvious you had simply cut and pasted from a Creationist website.<br>  Clearly you are completely ignorant of the subject you ask about. I suggest you do some research before you make claims you do not understand.|`|bEeozqacaa	The universe is billions of years old.<br>  <br>  Our planet is 4.5 billion years old and the universe is much older.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Ask this in the Astronomy section, where it belongs.<br>  <br>  But I'll say right now that it's rubbish, particularly when evolution is somehow conflated with the rest of the nonsense.

(practitioners of the craft will know what's coming next...) because if you don't then you are risking the money coming to you from a way that you would really hate.<br>  <br>  For instance your spell was worded 'I wish for money by whatever means' If you had done all the basic groundwork in the mundane world, you got a saturday job and were doing things around the house then the spell could work by your employer offering you more hours or your parents deciding that you'd worked so well you could take on some more weekend work that eventually leads to a permanent job, BUT if you are say, 13, haven't put the work in,don't have any grandparents or people who could gift you the money and you don't even ask about pocketmoney then Magic will take the only course of action it has according to natural laws ie it COULD result in the death of a parent from an illness that started after you did the spell, and in a years time you get an inheritance - there's your money! is it worth the heartache tho?<br>  <br>  This sort of thing is EXACTLY why you have to be so careful with wording your spell and in fact playing around with spells in the first place.|`|sWXrnErnaa	spells are a combination of desire, intent, visualisation, and energy raising - an example<br>  <br>  healing spell....<br>  <br>  desire - to heal a loved one<br>  Intent - to send your energy to specifically heal what is wrong with your loved one with belief that you can make a difference<br>  visualisation - seeing your loved one well, healthy and happy, <br>  energy raising - drawing upon your own and the universal energies and directing them with intention to the loved one.<br>  <br>  however this is just the basics in oder for a spell to work you must have some small understanding of how it works, and why it sometimes doesnt....<br>  <br>  for more information you can join my yahoo group - there is a heap of info posted in the archives about spell working and always more infor being posted, secondly I am willing to help with spells at no cost<br>  <br>  for more information :         Bunbury_Pagan_Network@yahoogroups.com.au|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	Were you properly grounded?

VxozKUcCaa	A phoenix is a mythical bird with a tail of beautiful gold and red plumage (or purple and blue, by some sources). It has a 500 to 1,000 year life-cycle, near the end of which it builds itself a nest of myrrh twigs that it then ignites; both nest and bird burn fiercely and are reduced to ashes, from which a new, young phoenix or phoenix egg arises, reborn anew to live again. The new phoenix is destined to live as long as its old self. In some stories, the new phoenix embalms the ashes of its old self in an egg made of myrrh and deposits it in the Egyptian city of Heliopolis (sun city in Greek).

Because its in Europe and I hear its a very nice country. :)|`|cVVvHNXSaa	Spain - the whole european thing..  or probably Argentina or Chile because its all the way down there.|`|C7umw5Vpaa	I like Spain but I would prefer Mexico because their country is beautiful, the people are friendly and because of their awesome beaches. Specially, Acapulco and Cancun. And to go meet Sammy Perez. Lol X D.
FUVoy02Uaa	I am Palestinian and I have lived in the UK almost all my life. I sometimes feel that I am too western which is a shame as I do love Arab culture but don't really fit in and sometimes wish my parents were more strict on me when I was growing up. <br>  <br>  I have nothing against the west, in fact I love this country as if it were my own and couldn't really imagine myself living anywhere else, but for me now when I'm thinking about my future, settling down, getting married and starting a family, it's difficult to think about the cultural differences and difficulties which will arise from the fact that I've been here since I was a couple of years old, that's 21 years away from my native culture...and I would never marry a man that wasn't Palestinian so it's gonna be pretty tough. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't really like to bring my child up in a western country but if I had to for reasons out of my control like what brought me and my parents here, I would make sure to teach my child the values of my culture and would make sure they weren't too westernised.
AA10945101	LAUGH...I wonder if we attend the same church!  <br>  <br>  I was sure my church was non-denominational...everything about it (except perhaps the sanctuary but I didn't make the connection) screamed "non-denominational"...the pastor teaching in jeans, no "hellfire and damnation" sermons, no "Sunday School", a coffee shop, lively contemporary music.  After attending for a few months, I decided to become a member...incidentally the first time in my life I ever formally joined a church (probably was a member of my parent's church as a child...don't remember). <br>  <br>  I wasn't mad when I went through the online membership course and discovered it was affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, but I did freak out a bit.  I stopped the application and did some serious praying and soul searching before I decided to continue.<br>  <br>  I think it was difficult for me because my mom was raised So. Baptist and my dad was raised Catholic.  When they married, they agreed to find a church that would work for both of them and quickly eliminated both Baptist and Catholic from the list.  Then I got about 20 years experience watching how both sides (grandparents and others) reacted...my mom's mom thought my dad was a "heathen"...dad's mom thought my mom was a "Jezebel" who lead my father astray.  ...and by the time I was about six, I had reached the same conclusion...anything EXCEPT Baptist or Catholic.  <br>  <br>  It took some doing, but God finally convinced me that my mom wouldn't turn over in her grave if I joined a Baptist church...and Dad only offered a few token protests and then decided it was rather funny...especially since my brother had recently been exploring Catholicism!<br>  <br>  It was an "Ahhhhaaa" moment for me too!...forced me to face some childhood prejudices...and while I still cringe a bit when I have to admit that I'm a member of a Baptist church, I am happy with my decision to join!|`|AA11074869	No just surprised and glad that some Baptist Churches are not just following a rigid denomination but being more free in their presentation of Christianity. There are different Baptist churches and an individual Pastor's influence can also make a church better or not.|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	No. . . I'd assume I should have done my homework better.  <br>  <br>  And if I felt I'd enjoyed the service and learned something from it, who cares if it's Baptist or not?|`|8IHfytEvaa	No.<br>  <br>  Remember that there are at least 57 different kinds of Baptists around and some are different as night and day.|`|2nFMyU0Xaa	yea i would be a little angry...on a side note, why do atheist get on certain answers and say arrogant things? this questions atheist was not so bad, but i have heard some very cruel answers before|`|5XXna4C5aa	I would be if they were purposely hiding their identity|`|Dn251zLyaa	Not if I agreed with what they were preaching and they weren't trying to be deceptive.|`|tQW18Kspaa	Yes.......|`|70c123af1cd3280ff233871ee1472e7eaa	as long as they are a bible teaching, holy spirit preaching, Jesus Christ believing church - I don't believe that I would be mad.|`|AA11232725	No because Baptist churches at least teach the truth about God really only having one church that is the Spiritual body of Christ made up of all born again believers.|`|AA10057370	I don't think I'd be mad.|`|AA12383652	Are you talking about the Saddleback Church, lol?  (Rick Warrens)<br>  <br>  because a lot of people think that it is non denominational and were surprised when they found out it wasnt.<br>  <br>  I dont get why a church would underscore the denomination.  It kind of makes a big difference.|`|QPbnFJGKaa	It's interesting you say that.  I went to a 'non-denominational' church for a couple of years and found out that they really were Baptist.  They claimed they had 'Baptist Roots' which really meant they were Baptist.  It didn't make me mad, I kind of felt lied to though.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	I wouldnt make assumptions....I find out BEFore going and Baptist isnt my thing....I like openminded ones more like Methodist|`|AA12360579	Why on earth would I be in a church of any sort?

You have done nothing wrong.  You did not ask to be born. The circumstances may have been less than ideal, but God gave you life.  He gave you the ability to see that you are not a mistake.  Don't let the sins and failings of other keep you from being someone in life and from turning to the Lord.  He is the ultimate one keeping score, not your parents.  Seek the Lord and He will be found, regardless of sins and failings of others.|`|y6zJbaK7aa	How is it punishment?  That your biological father is Native American, or that he's a massage therapist?  By the sounds of things, it sounds like you're being rewarded, rather than having that religious wingnut being your biological father!|`|7Ruzpu2Uaa	No. There are events which we could not understand for the moment. Like your being born as you have, it could not be punishment. Why, were you already a sinner before you were born?  And is the circumstance of your birth, or your having been born bad for you at all? But these events are events in themselves, and not to punish anyone.|`|J03Qy5aoaa	so, your dad is john redcorn? <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Av6VYOVpHWeVTkNGNClytPbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304221714AAeYZFe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|TKYfCGMuaa	is he god?|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	i saw that episode!!|`|JFrFh84Aaa	remember, god cares about you. he wouldnt do anything that would hurt you SO much. the guy that jst told you that its your punishment should seriously do some bible reading. god wants you to be safe, so dont worry. are you a believer? then you can pray and ask Him all your questions. it seems impossible, but he answers you! :]<br>  god bless,<br>  Joanna|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	FFS people wake up...this is not the first question by this person on a damn TV SHOW! its not real. stop being gullible

0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	You reminded me of me when I was younger. Every time I tried something, I'd feel very awkward. I almost felt wrong or something. It's a silly feeling. It's just normal to want to try new things and see what makes you feel better!<br>  <br>  Hey when I have my "happy time" I just do it b/c it feels freakin' awesome! I like it and I'm not hurting or bothering anyone. Trust me, you aren't the only one out there and other's have done more wilder things than you can imagine. <br>  <br>  Whatever you use to please yourself, you go for it! Again, as long as it doesn't effect anyone. Porn, toys, whatever. You find what's good for you and stick with it. If you want to explore, then be like Dora! LOL|`|qTRzRi8gaa	Man why feel guilty?  It's just sex.  I don't get the weird reservations much of our culture has in regards to sex.<br>  <br>  I hardly ever feel guilty with those sorts of things.  Maybe when I was a bit younger, but not at all now.  Actually 'bad' or 'naughty' things are a bit of a turn on, now...<br>  <br>  Try being a 'rebel' or something, view your guilt as a pointless roadblock or something to stand against or protest against, internally.  Most of conventional sexual 'morality' is just an attempt to turn something fun and enjoyable into something that's supposedly bad or wicked.  Most people are freaks in some sense, sexually.  I'd just roll with it, since I can't see any reason to feel guilty about it...|`|MgMsMExPaa	You cannot go through life being concerned about this puritanical belief. Masturbation is a normal biological urge and should not condemned by anyone. So if you have any religious hang ups regarding this they are unfounded. That is going to be part of your entire life so enjoy it that is why it is there. If you want to have sex then do so at your age you should know how to protect yourself . Then enjoy sex with whomever you wish. Or as many as you wish. There are gay and lesbian support groups in most large cities, look one up. If you cannot find one then go to a gay bar and pick up some of the local reading material there and see if you can find one that way.  As for the porn as long as you control it and it dose not control you it is fine. I bet if you found a boyfriend you would throw your inhibitions out the window.|`|2lim0SHvaa	Relax. You need a friend to talk this out. This will help root out the source of your guilt, which you want to get past asap.<br>  Try to find support at your local GLBT Community Center.<br>  Or come and live with me.|`|4KNESOnlaa	WOW,,,,,,I get scared when I can't cummm atleast 3 times a day.....you need to get laid.....BADLY.......after that you will want it so much that any guilt you have is left in the dust.......|`|9QAVNJtWaa	why do you feel bad?<br>  <br>  look at it this way - sex / masturbation is good for your prostate health, so how can something that keeps you healthy be bad?|`|WNIL4sLiaa	Never be ashamed or fee guilty of self pleasure, you're not hurting anyone; besides you are not only taking the urge away at the time, you are also exercising a muscle and moving sperm on that will die and be replaced in 4 to 6 weeks anyway. Even your dad masturbated when he was a teen and still does no doubt from time to time now. Trying something new is how you find what pleases you the best and can be shared with someone in the future. You'd be suprized, even straight guys and gals pleasure themselves in ways you'd never try. ER doctors and nurses see it all the time.<br>  Watching pron now and then isn't a bad thing either, so long as it is preformed by age consenting people (NO KIDS involved) nor animals and isn't something you do everyday and for long hours at a time. Just do it to get your rocks off and maybe learn a new technique or two that may be very pleasurable once you have a partner.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	First of all, being scared about sex is normal. A lot of people are like that, so you're not alone.<br>  <br>  Now... porn isn't a bad thing. If you find yourself obsessed with it to the point where it's damaging your life or the lives of others, then there's an issue. But if it's something you just watch to get off and enjoy it, it's not horrible.<br>  <br>  As for feeling guilty and all that... You need to identify WHY you feel that way. Is it because you feel it's pathetic, is it religious programming, something that happened to you when growing up or something? Once you figure out why you feel the way you do, you can go about solving the problem by facing it and realizing that it's not something to feel guilty about.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|Xp1FZaNSaa	I'm a girl, 17 and straight. I have got the same problem as you do. So, I do know how you feel but nowadays, I am little more open to sex already but I still feel guilty when I please myself. I even feel guilty for watching porn. However, at the moment, I am already getting use to watching Yaoi Anime, compare to last time when my thoughts used to hold me back. Try watching Yaoi Anime, maybe it will help you a little bit with dealing your problem. For me, it does really lighten up my problem.<br>  <br>  FYI, Yaoi Anime means male and male relationship in japanese cartoon. Since you are gay, I think you will like it.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know that you are not alone in dealing with this kind of situation...|`|Jfj1tLlbaa	oh goodness.  dont you dare feel guilty. feel proud of yourself.if you were to not do this, you would have all this built up energy you feel the need to release. its natural. im guessing at least 99% of people do it, which includes me. the other 1% probably feel very frustrated.|`|idedCbIYaa	what ever gets you through your life, its alright.|`|hfSKP0ZVaa	just be ur self!!

GJS3hTK5aa	The love we give and receive here is not real. This is temporary. Today, you maybe loving your spouse; the same you will abandon her mercilessly tomorrow. So, your love is unreal. That is the kind of love we get and give here. It is unreal. But the love of God is real and it is eternal. In heaven, when we receive love from the real source of love, we will be in a very different state of mind. And for your information, in heaven, we will have our bodies which will not be like the perishing body we do have now. God will resurrect us from dust and our spirits shall receive a heavenly body from it. Since these things are not revealed to anyone by God so far, we can find this fact from the resurrected body of Christ alone.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Yes I believe so, we will still have the erotic, fraternal and unconditional love in heaven but in a more perfect way, without a shadow of selfishness.|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	I guess you'll know when youre dead.|`|JL8KpDYnaa	you will finally love completely in a way we could not imagine.

Can you be savedif you were not one of the lucky ones? No. But neither would you want to be. You will remain in total rebellion to God all your life and dissolve into that alone at the end of your life. It is not going to be as if those who are in hell will be wishing they could jump out and join those that are in Heaven. Rather, they will be reduced to their core spiritual components, those remaining in unabashed wretched rebellion forever, and would not even then ever choose to be in God's company.<br>  <br>  The Bible says there is none that seek God. (Romans 3).<br>  <br>  But Jesus also says, in John 10:27 "My sheep know my voice, I know them, and they follow me ..."<br>  <br>  His sheep won't be waiting until after they die.<br>  <br>  Oh, one more thing, you say you are a good and loving person, but God's standard is one of absolute perfection.

But it's natural to question and I believe God wants us to question. Faith doesn't have to be quite so blind. Many of the answers are there if you're willing to look.

GJS3hTK5aa	Suppose you have beaten up a person. You felt sorry and asked him to beat you up instead. Does this act cancel what you did? No. Instead of him beating you up, you gave him some other favor or money or anything, can any of it replace your evil act? We can not take back our word and act for any reason. Doing good is a different issue. But doing good can not compensate our sins. This is what the Bible says, we get remission of sins through Jesus alone. When you ask for remission of sins in the name of Jesus, God remembers his tribulations and sufferings on cross without doing any sin and he delivers you from all of it. There is no other way to get remission of sins. Now, for good deeds, you shall get blessed by God in this life itself. For every good act you do, he will bless you in multiple folds. But they can not compensate our sins.|`|EXurNsB4aa	No... I think people generally misunderstand the idea of karma.

cPQ7TBcuaa	That's the way I was. Well, I did have one close friend...but she turned out to be the biggest back-stabber EVER. I think that the widespread acquaintance system is good. Just make conversation, which you must do already if you have friends spread everywhere. Find a few that you have the most in common with and go from there. What are your hobbies? Find someone else that shares some of those same hobbies and try doing them together. Like to go fishing? Find someone else that does too and go fishing together...Just say something like "Well, I go fishing at ...... creek occasionally, we should go some time." Just apply that concept to one of your hobbies.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	I didn't even care if people thought if it was bad or strange I wasn't in a group when I was at school.

DDrcQC4Taa	You already know it will compromise your relationship with Jehovah. The purpose of sororities is to develop and maintain lifelong friendships and to establish future business contacts.This world has no future. So why pursue such relationships? <br>    1 Cor. 7:29-31 warns Christians that the time left is reduced, and that the scene of this world is changing. What part of that do you not believe? Especially since the election?<br>   Remember too, James 4:4: "Adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world is constituting himself an enemy of God."  Did you notice those strong words? Referring to Christians choosing to be friends with the world? Adultery is how Jehovah views our turning our attention to worldly pursuits instead of loyally standing firm for Jehovah. Matt. 6:24 " No one can slave for two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will stick to the one and despise the other. You cannot slave for God and for Riches." Those were Jesus' words.<br>    Proverbs 10:22 promises " The blessing of Jehovah - that is what makes one rich, and he adds no pain with it." <br>    This is Your decision to make Alone. Those of us that have made this choice had to reach this decision for ourselves. We cannot tell you what to do, only give you the same sound counsel each of us was at one time or another given from the Bible. It really comes down to are you ready and willing to do as Jesus said all his followers would have to do at Mark 8:34:" If anyone wants to come after me, let him disown himself and pick up his torture stake and follow me continually." In verses 35-38 of that same chapter 8 Jesus explains the results of not following him.<br>    To get baptized as a Witness you must first make a private dedication of yourself to Jehovah in prayer. That dedication means you let go of this world and look forward to the Real World we were all intended to live in. Read the description below of one sister's visualisation of what we have to look forward to. It is real to her, you need to make your future life in the New System real to you. College and Sororities are designed to impress upon you what real life in this world is like. Is that where you really want to be?<br>  <br>  I hope not, for life, real life as Jehovah intended for us to live is so much better to contemplate. I hope you one day let me know you are My SISTER in Jehovah's family. Agape' Tirshatha <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  'One day of the Real Life'<br>  <br>  Nowadays I like getting up with the sun and starting my day while it‚Äôs fresh and new. No more hitting that snooze button until the very last minute and dreading the workday ahead of me! I feel better and better every day, and I can‚Äôt help but notice I look better too. I have several jobs, and today I am privileged to be doing my very favorite task! Besides studying with newly resurrected ones, I have been granted the privilege of using my home as a sort of New System Bed and Breakfast. While the Resurrection Center was being constructed, I had a house full, 2 couples and two single sisters who lived here with me temporarily. Now that that work is over, families who live too far away from the Resurrection Center come and stay with me, sometimes just a few nights, often a week while their newly resurrected loved ones acclimate to this wonderful new world. This house has seen so much joy!<br>  <br>  I have company arriving today ‚Äì two fleshly brothers whose parents died in a car accident and are going to be resurrected in the same week. I want to make something special for tonight, so I head out to the raspberry patch to gather some to add to the apple pie I‚Äôm planning for dessert. The fox family that lives among the raspberry bushes comes out to greet me, the mother elegantly gliding toward me to have her chin scratched, and three cubs tumbling over each other in their play. My chickens aren‚Äôt a bit alarmed at all these foxes nearby, they go on searching for worms and scratching around the yard, clucking contentedly to one another.<br>  <br>  I‚Äôm nearly finished gathering berries when I notice two people coming along the path at the top of the hill. My Mother and her sister JoeAnn often come over for a cup of tea early in the morning; their home is only a 15 minute walk away through a beautiful wildflower garden, around the little pond, then through the forest and down the grassy hill to my house. The two of them are halfway here when a tall blond boy emerges from the woods, running as fast as his long legs will carry him to catch up to them. Their conversation stops as they turn at the sound, the youth skids to a stop to talk to them. Whatever Mom tells him, I can see it‚Äôs what he was hoping for, because he hugs her so hard he picks her up, and then leaving the path he runs towards the barn. My favorite Icelandic mare has a two week old foal, so I know where my brother is heading!<br>  <br>  He notices me as he runs, he waves but doesn‚Äôt slow down ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad, even afterall these years I still get tears in my eyes sometimes at the sight of him. Dougie had died in the old world when he was only a baby, and the day he was resurrected was one of the happiest of all of our lives. My dear Mom had kept so much of the pain of losing him to herself, but when they placed her baby boy in her arms, she cried tears of joy for days afterwards. She and JoeAnn have really enjoyed raising him, from a chubby blond baby to an enthusiastic teenager now as tall as me, and sure to grow taller.<br>  <br>  I‚Äôm glad Dougie ‚Äì no, he wants to be called Doug now, he thinks it sounds so much more grown up ‚Äì went to the barn, I know he‚Äôll put out fresh food and water for the animals, so I‚Äôll have plenty of time to give him another lesson driving the curricle. What a joy it‚Äôs been to watch him grow up in this new world, with no more worries of sickness or any other harm coming to him. <br>  I go into the house to put the tea kettle on to boil, and soon Mom and JoeAnn come in, full of happiness and good health. They both look radiant from their walk, and so beautiful. No more gray hair ‚Äì in fact, Mom‚Äôs hair is thicker and more beautiful than in her youth. Their wrinkles have faded away from their faces; they seem to look younger every time I see them. <br>  <br>  Mom has a package with her, as she unwraps it she tells me it came yesterday from the message service with a long letter from my daughter Bethany. She and her husband are in the reconstruction work, but somehow she managed to find the time to paint a portrait of her newest granddaughter, Elizabeth. The picture is beautifully done, a sleeping chubby infant perhaps a few weeks old. Bethany always had artistic talent, but in the new world now, growing towards perfection, she has really surpassed herself. Busy with construction projects, Bethany isn‚Äôt spending a lot of time working on art ‚Äì she knows she has forever to develop her talent! This painting she did especially for her grandmother and it warms my heart to see how happy Mom is.<br>  <br>  While I make the pie crust and cut up the apples, we exchange news of friends and family, many of them far away in different assignments. Doug runs in to ask if I mind if he rides Henrietta, the Llama, and dashes out again to get her saddled up. Then I hear him calling out a greeting, and I see in the shade of the big elm trees at the end of the garden two men sitting on the wooden bench ‚Äì they must be my guests! We all go out to meet them, they look vaguely familiar but I can‚Äôt think of who they might be. One walks up to me with a twinkle in his eye and says, ‚ÄúAnn, don‚Äôt you recognize me? I‚Äôm Arly, and this is my brother Vern!‚Äù For a second we were speechless, and then everyone was hugging each other and talking all at once. It‚Äôs not surprising that we didn‚Äôt recognize them, with their wavy brown hair and bright blue eyes. Vern had died in his 92nd year, the last time I had seen him he was barely able to talk and confined to a wheelchair. Arly had nearly lost his sight due<br>  to cataracts, and had to walk with a cane. Yet here they were, looking like they had never seen forty! Vern was one of the original special pioneers who opened up the preaching work in our area long before I was born, and Arly had been a most beloved elder in our congregation. What an unspeakable joy to have them as guests in my house! <br>  <br>  We show them all around, and after lunch Vern volunteers to give Doug his driving lesson. Mom and JoeAnn have studies to conduct in the afternoon, but we arrange to have a get-together soon and invite many of the neighbors who know Vern and Arly.<br>  <br>  After many hours spent talking, reminiscing and catching up on news of dear friends near and far, Vern and Arly go up to their rooms to unpack, and I go into the garden to pick some vegetables for supper. What a good day this has been! I‚Äôm so full of joy, I can barely hold it all in, so I don‚Äôt even try. I fall down on my knees in the rich garden soil and thank my heavenly father Jehovah once more for all his bounteous blessings. Today was just one memorable, joyful day; one of an infinite number of days filled with joy ahead of us all ‚Äì an eternity!<br>  <br>  Written by LuAnn Simms of USA|`|XlUfmy4jaa	I'm a hopeful Delta myself.

MAl9tcX0aa	It sounds to me as if you are not bisexual, but are gay instead... and yes, there is a huge difference.  Being gay in a hetero marriage is an outright disaster, however one can be bi and married as you are still physically attracted to your mate.  I am sorry, but I personally feel you should not marry or make any serious commitment until you have this sorted out.  Being bisexual myself, I can tell you that it is a challenge and a half to maintain a marriage, let alone a bisexual one.  <br>  <br>  There are MANY bi married couples out there these days... and a large number of them are with bi men with straight wives, however, I would advise against this unless she has either seen you with another man sexually (completely) or participates in a bi threesome with you.  Why?  Well, because in her MIND she may be able to accept it, however, in reality she may not.  My suggestion would be to get into a 'both-bi' type of relationship to avoid any finger-pointing issues in the future.<br>  <br>  Yes, one can be bisexual and have a very healthy, loving relationship with their wives (and yes, many are good fathers), but it takes a great deal of OPEN, HONEST communication - and being on the down-low is NOT the right course to enter into any seriously-committed relationship, period.  It is cheating and why would you want to have relationship beginning with a foundation of distrust?  If she can't accept you being bi, then MOVE ON to someone who will.  I personally am a born-again Christian who became bisexual well after making that commitment to the Lord.  It took me years to finally embrace myself without shame - and it all came through professional therapy as well as confessing myself to my creator and not trying in vain to change who I am that God created me to be.  For the last several years of my marriage, I was mocked bi the woman who initially said she could accept my bi-curiosity and eventual bisexuality, however, ironically, only recently I found out was/is a closeted-lesbian herself which certainly explained our sexless marriage.  Go figure.  Naturally, we physically went our separate ways as she no longer had any attraction towards men and things went south fast ending in a very nasty divorce.  Do you see the parallel here?  I know it will be difficult for me as a divorced man to find a Christian woman to date and possibly marry who will accept my bisexuality, but in my recent attempts, believe it or not, I have found quite a few who do, refreshingly, so there is hope.<br>  <br>  I think you need to seriously consider all the factors involved before you proceed any further into any relationships you have involving commitment - remember, there are REAL people involved - and presumably, ones you care about... or if you have kids, will care about  and care for until you leave this earth.  You can't divorce your kids.   There are serious repercussions over your ignorance in this matter, so educate yourself bi reading some good books on the subject... Amazon has several available for purchase.  Think before you make this leap and find some people in similar situations to get some first-hand advice - and I would also encourage you to seek counseling... it will help you realize why you are who you are and come to grips with accepting that and embracing yourself to fully love and accept you as God does, regardless of your orientation.  Feeling shameful about who you are will only lead to a path of self-destruction.  Good luck in finding yourself.|`|MgMsMExPaa	Your future is what you make it.

Please read Matthew 5-7 and check whether you truly follow it. Attending Church surely enhances our spirituality; but most important is our lifestyle. Ordinary people consider our apparent behavior and attitude; but God looks into our hearts. Whatever we think and do, he knows. So cleanse up your mind and take away the worries and temptations of this small life. Think of your eternal life with the Lord and always strive to achieve it.

Do you know that Christ died on the cross in payment of your sin? Do you accept His grace? Do you practice His grace? Have you confessed your sins and asked for forgiveness? Identify areas in your life which are sinful and walk away from them. It is not easy, but it is simple. If there are what seem to be complexities and obstacles to living a life which is pleasing to God, you have to get rid of them. It is not easy to counsel somebody with as little information as this forum allows for, but if you want to get right, look inside yourself, ask for guidance of the Holy Spirit, stay in God's word and do not allow the devil to cause confusion in your life. If you need an ear, I accept e-mail. You are in my prayers. God bless.|`|lmQYJEp4aa	You must repent.  That is, you must change your heart.  You must change the attitude of your will from one of supreme selfishness to becoming unselfish and benevolent for the sole honor and glory of God.  Again, you must stop loving your own interests supremely and begin loving God with your whole heart and begin loving your neighbor as yourself.  God has the right to require this and it is theft if you steal your love from him.  You must see it as theft, I pray you see this by the Holy Spirit.  It is wrong and dishonoring to God for you to serve him out of ultimate self-interest.  Give yourself to him wholly and unconditionally.  This is what the apostles meant by repentance.<br>  You must believe.  That is, you must take God at his word that 'the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin' and that 'he who comes to' Jesus, he will certainly not cast out.  Believing is confiding or trusting in Christ and his promises as the word of God to you as a condition of acceptance with God, for 'the just shall live by faith'.  <br>  Upon these two conditions hang salvation and pardon.  If you do not meet these conditions, God cannot forgive you and you have no right to be forgiven.  God has made atonement, or a substitute for punishment, available.  You can not grasp it by faith until you release your grip on an unrepentant heart and submit without conditions to the gospel.|`|AA10213887	by asking God into your heart, believing that he died for one reason you, and also believe that God the father raised him from the dead, in Romans 10:9 it says, for if you confess with your mouth, and adhere, believe and rely on, that Jesus is the Lord and is Gods son, and that God raised him from the dead, believe all of this you shall be saved, all he asks is that you believe it, do you? if so then you are saved, get baptized if u haven't, i am going to be in the spring, its a step of faith and letting the world know you want to follow and obey God and his commandments, read the bible every day, study it, write down what you do not understand and ask God for guidance and advice, only he can help you and save you, you must realize that you are a sinner, admit it, as well as your sins, turn away  from it meaning repent be sorry and mean what you say, be cause God knows you and what is inside your heart. Only he can make you happy, also u need to realize Jesus and God are the only 2 who can save you, you can't save yourself, thats why Jesus was sent here all along to die not only for us but for you, and your sins so you could be forgiven, and be in right standing with God, just trust God and believe, and i promise you if you seek him with all your heart you will indeed find him and the answers you seek.

They tend to look back and see all the thing they have done that arent pleasing and think that they have gone to far or done to much to ever be accepted back by God. What they dont realize is that God is a forgiving God and the moment someone says "I'm sorry." that God is just and will forgive them. At that moment they are back in a "right" relationship with him. Yes there are some things that may need to be corrected, but that happens after the forgiveness. You may have some tuff lifestyle/character changes to make or habits to break, but as far as God is concerned you were forgiven the moment you decided to turn from your ways and follow his way again.|`|9agMsmCyaa	I was also raised a Catholic but because of many things I saw, heard and experienced I left, tried the protestant church but it was the same there.  I lived for a long time as you say far from a christian life.  I hit real rock bottom and didn't care too much if I lived or died and started to live really badly.<br>  <br>  One day I was witnessed to by one of Jehovah's Witnesses, we talked about why bad things happen to good people and why the world is in such a mess.  I'd lost complete belief in a God so I didn't trust this angle that the witness used but I received a book called Evolution or Creation - Mankind's beginning and it so logically proved that there is a God - but not the God that is portrayed by much of christendom (hell-heaven, punishment-forgiveness, lots of saints, holidays, rituals etc) but God as the Bible really reveals.  I accepted a Bible study and it changed my life very quickly.  I learnt (not from the Witnesses as they only use the Bible) from the Bible with the help of the Witnesses the answers to all my questions and I proved that the Bible is the only source of the truth.  I'm now baptized nearly 9years and my life couldn't be better.  All my relatives have expressed how my being one of Jehovah's Witnesses has been the best decision I've ever made.  They saw the before and after.<br>  <br>  You say you also want to change your life for the better - for all who want to live as God requires this needs an open, sincere heart to accept what the Bible says and be ready to make changes that won't be so easy to begin with but it's certainly worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  You can request a free Bible study on www.watchtower.org or check out your local Jehovah's Witnesses or pray a lot for God to help you find the true religion.|`|g1DF62jHaa	If you are truly serious then God will know that, He will accept you exactly as you are and purify you from the inside out.

Go to church at least every once in awhile.  You don't need to go and you don't need to be perfect.  What you need to do can be summed up in one word: "repent."

But I'm still a die hard Christian because I believe in Jesus and if my actions don't match up my mind at least belongs to Him.  We are not are sins.  I struggle with sin badly.  Please read Romans Chapter 7.  The latter half on the chapter is about struggling with sin.  I congratulate you on the choices you are making.  When I am messing things up and sinning with stuff I know I shouldn't I trust that God will take care of me and I ask Him.  Just trust Him.  If you sin and you know you are sinning God is against that more than if you are unaware.  So try to stop the major sins in your life that you know are wrong.

oVeGMNsLaa	I'm not bisexual, but pansexual, so I'm one of the precious few who like transfolk.  But I'll try to answer this, because it ties into something I've been thinking a lot about.<br>  <br>  Lately, I keep on thinking that people are mixing up ideas of what bisexuality and pansexuality are.  I get so tired of hearing somebody ask what they are, and then the answer they receive is "when you can fall in love with anyone, you don't care about their gender".  I know the people answering mean well, but that's not how I feel at all.<br>  <br>  I think that there is an orientation where people don't give a wit about what's in somebody's pants, and they can fall in love regardless of gender, and they love the person, not the genitals.  I think a lot of people have a fluid sexuality like that.  But I don't think it's the same as bisexuality or pansexuality.  To me, bisexuality means not simply being passive in your attractions, but being active.  Bisexuals fantasize as well, and a lot of the time, the person in our fantasies is not some full-fleshed human we've come to know and love, but just a body, a p*ssy or a d*ck.  Bisexuals actively lust after men and women, the same way that gay men actively lust after men and straight men actively lust after women and yada yada yada.  Same for pansexuals- we actively lust after all sorts of bodies and genitalia, be they male, female, trans, intersex.  We see the sexual attractiveness of these people, without having to fall in love first.<br>  <br>  It's such a fine distinction, but it makes all the difference, because then it puts a real cap on what bisexuality can be.  Bisexuals who brag about it being more about personality than anything else but who still wouldn't date a transgender person ARE bisexual.  But our definition of bisexuality needs to be tweaked from this whole "it's personality and love" thing if we're going to be honest.<br>  <br>  I don't know that I've made a lot of sense, but yeah.  Those are my thoughts at the moment.<br>  <br>  (Oh, and P.S.- J.D. is SO adorkable!)|`|l8c2kTlvaa	Well, I look more for personality in people - I don't really care whether is a person is male or female, if they have a great personality then thats all that really matters. Of course looks matter, but not that much.<br>  <br>  I think I could date a transgender or transexual person, I don't really care about a persons sex/gender. I don't want gender and sex to mismatch, but I wouldn't mind if they did.|`|Y16olPxlaa	I'm straight.<br>  But I HAD to say..<br>  I love scrubs.|`|GrRXAjF7aa	Transsexual I deal with, and transgender people are fine for a quikie out the back, but I don't like transgender people, there's just too much **** that people tend to give them and their partners, I know it sounds selfish, but I don't want to be with someone who attracts any more negative attention than i already have.<br>  <br>  And as someone previously mentioned, I like feminine boys (not so much masculine girls) and I love boys in skirts and heels... :)|`|WHcBV7rLaa	I am attracted to men and women physically as well as personality-wise. Yes, I would date a transgender of either sex, because I consider them to be their psychological sex, not their biological one. I've been attracted to transsexuals before and I likely will be again.<br>  I also like some feminine boys and some masculine girls, each to a point though, but thats just my preference.

NWs9R7h3aa	I have been speaking Spanish so long now that many people think that I am Mexican (as my accent and habits were learned from Mexicans). I have to say that it has always surprised me that:<br>  <br>  1) So many people are surprised by an American speaking Spanish well, when thousands of Mexicans have come to our country and mastered our language (in spite of the stereotypes, there are many Mexicans that you couldn't guess were not from here because they speak English so well).<br>  <br>  2) There are not more Americans trying to learn Spanish and correctly.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of it is due to ignorance and laziness.<br>  <br>  Many people would only want to learn Spanish because of some sort of benefit that it represents to them, not because they truly want to learn it. If they truly wanted to learn it because they wanted to open themselves up to the extremely rich and beautiful culture that we have right across our border to the South...there would be a lot less ignorant people speaking poorly of Mexicans and M√©xico.<br>  <br>  I have to say that my experience is with the Mexican people and culture...I can only speak from this experience...this is why I mention only that country and culture.|`|Cu6kOvdiaa	no <br>  they arnt embarrassed or anything<br>  some are just not good at it even if they do try|`|AA10204623	Well all i can say is that i do believe some americans feel embarrased speaking another language because maybe they think they will say something wrong and maybe made fun off. I honestly know how it feels, but is the other way around. English is my second language and at the beggining i felt so embarrased to speak it and i would rather pretend i didnt undertood it that actually speak it. Now im over that, i really dont care what other people think of my accent. At least i understand it and speak it. i feel bless knowing 2 languages. My accent is what found me my husband. He is an American and he just fell in love with my accent. He thinks is sexy! and to answer one of your questions, my husband does try his best to speak Spanish the best way posible. Honestly i dont find an acent when he try to speak Spanish.|`|AA11747527	Well that video was someone who doesn't know spanish at all just reading it off a screen someone else probably wrote.  it was kinda funny actually.  <br>  <br>  Now to answer you're question Spanish and English are extremely different languages.  It is not even remotely similar so I can see why some people have a hard time with it.  Some people have a hard enough time learning it let alone mastering the accent.  I think a lot of these people who actually learn the language probably don't end up using it enough to develop the proper accent.  They just learn it in case they need it for work or some other part of life.  I don't think they learn it just because they want to, but because it is necessary.  English is the language spoken in America, not Spanish.<br>  <br>  That all being said, i speak Portuguese and some Spanish.  I'd like to think i have good accents on both.  To be totally honest it does annoy me a lot when someone butchers the Spanish words and pronounces them in a very american way....  with no proper spanish pronounciation whatsoever... yeah it sucks... don't like it either but what you gonna do.  At least it provides some material for George Lopez lol|`|axxQzOCHaa	Sadly there are too many Americans who think that being proficient in another language (in addition to english) is a sign of "not being American" while I am a U.S. Citizen, I have also lived in several other countries and am consequently fluent in both french + spanish|`|q2ul38GQaa	I learn languages at school and I am a pretty confidant speaker of English, I have no trouble making a speech in front of people but when someone says this/something in french or talk in Spanish I freeze up and won't do it or sometimes will speak gibberish with an accent. Speaking other languages involves making "funny" or "weird" sounds that we don't have in English such as the rr in Spanish. Plus for many people like myself, pronunciation is the hardest part of the language because a word mispronounced can be something else entirely and the written language is more common for learners to be familiar with than the spoken. <br>  <br>  When everyone else is speaking one language and you are speaking another it feels weird for you and you feel out of place and kinda outcasted, same with accents, so you try to be like them, which is why kids pick up the accent of the people they go to school with very quickly. I think it is not just an American thing but a universal thing, mainly out of embarrassment and self-consciousness not the arrogant, I'm an American and y'all should talk like me stereotypical approach.<br>  <br>  I think if many of these "bad accenters" had to talk with a native Spanish speaker, or a group of native Spanish speakers, they would make an effort to sound Spanish, especially if they were the only English speaker.
b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	It's annoying to hear people butchering a language. This was basically some college kids who didn't care. Some people really have a major problem adjusting to another language and the rules for spanish can be difficult for alot of people.  As long as their friends speak it incorrectly, they continue to be bad at it. <br>  <br>  To correct you ... it doesn't seem as if all Americans don't adapt. That is an all encompassing statement that should be avoided. If that's how you personally feel, then say so. Some people make others in their group look bad. That goes for gender, ethnicity, and nationality. Not all Americans are embarrassed to try another language. Stop generalizing. I speak 4 languages well and I don't have a problem with accents..|`|oSSL1wKpaa	The people in that video were just messing around - I think you're taking things too seriously.|`|pfke6Jieaa	why should americans learn spanish in their own country? i would be embarrased if i had to speak another language in my own country too.<br>  <br>  EDIT: why? why do immigrants need an excuse if they cant learn the language here? if spanish people came to my country they will not be allowed to live or work there unless they speak arabic. the same with americans. knowing english isnt gonna cut it. it is not an english speaking country so they need to learn our language. <br>  <br>  its ok if few people show an interest but it needs not to be mandatory, especially if they are in their own country.|`|rSKZguGQaa	Yeah you are taking things to seriously like one guy said. They don't have control over if they are bad at the language, most people just take it for school because they have to and its easier than the other languages. People who are embarrassed are because they don't feel like they do it good enough most of the time. <br>  <br>  And people who say that people should learn OUR language, thats stupid. Anyone who says something like that is ignorant. People don't have to learn a language they don't want to, and if people learn another language they shouldn't be embarrassed about it, thats just a moronic thing to say. Besides English wasn't even the first language in the US, not even close to it.|`|gwrrkYV3aa	Not all Americans have a hard time speaking a language other than their own it just depends on the person and you can't generalize all Americans on some video you watched on youtube. Try having an old woman from Romania speak English will she have a hard time probably but who cares. If your not used to speaking a language you will struggle it won't be perfect it is a second language to you not a first.|`|600U6iAWaa	Spanish is almost second-nature to me and I'm American.<br>  <br>  Of course, my parents are from Europe (Ireland) and I grew up there for a few years but I'm American.<br>  <br>  I have no problem rolling the "r"s and stuff. Spanish is an incredibly easy language. I feel like I'm remembering it rather than learning it.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	No hablo your language.|`|bpYn0ZD1aa	I doubt they did it on purpose. Some people are just really bad at that stuff. Besides if people are going to come to live in OUR country they should learn to speak OUR laguage. Not the other way around.

In recapping events they are not necessarily mentioned in chronological order, but in the order which makes most sense to the focus of the account. For example, the animals are mentioned in verse 19, after Adam was created, because it was after Adam was created that he was shown the animals, not that they were created after Adam.<br>  <br>  Genesis chapters 1 and 2 are not therefore separate contradictory accounts of creation.

The notes in my Bible say that the meaning in the original texts was to describe total detachment.  To say that you should "hate" those things meant that you should be totally detached from them.   <br>  <br>  This is an example of why we should be very careful about reading the Bible literally.  It is True,  but The Bible is easy to misunderstand if you try to read it without knowing the original language, or without having good translation notes and a good teacher.  <br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic, and this Bible verse is an example of why I think the Catholic Church should be regarded as the proper authority for interpreting scripture.  I like being guided by almost 2000 years of scriptural and theological scholarship.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.<br>  And don't actually hate your family or yourself in the sense that we use the word "hate" in modern English.

The point of the list is that no other relationship is first for a disciple. "Hate" is used figuratively and suggests a priority of relationship. Jesus is first. To follow Jesus means to follow Jesus, not anyone or anything else. A disciple is a learner, and the primary teacher in life is Jesus. This total loyalty is crucial, given the rejection and persecution that lie ahead. If his followers care more about family than about Jesus, when families are divided under pressure of persecution, they will choose against Jesus. This is what lies behind Jesus' remarks. Discipleship is not possible if Jesus is not the teacher.<br>  <br>  This is why bearing the cross and coming after Jesus is the issue of discipleship. Learning from Jesus means following him, experiencing the rejection he experienced and so bearing the cross he bore. We cannot "learn Jesus" without being prepared to walk this path. Discipleship is basically allegiance. To follow Jesus is to rely on him.

But we all do good things and right things grudgingly because we know they are right or we care about the people they will benefit.

I don't hate it, but it doesn't really bring me any great joy to give money, even to charities I know are doing good things with it.

For instance, a person may live for decades, and never know that they were colour blind, and could not see part of the supposedly visible light spectrum.<br>  <br>  To see God or Satan without their wishing to be seen reqires a shift in the spectrum of our conscious awareness. When a person can extend their senses in this way, God and Satan are not the onnly things they can *see.* People who claim to be able to *see* God and Devils are probably deluded when it emerges this this is the ONLY thing they can *see.* For instance, a person who can perceive these beings should be able to diagnose and even cure sicknesses and diseases. <br>  <br>  They should also be able to detect and distinguish between minerals- such as water, ores, and precious stones. There are people who can do all this, and still not *see* God.<br>  <br>  It is arrogant for a person who does not even know how to extend their senses to *see* things in this Physical World to claim that The Spirit World does not exist because he can't see it!

"He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, <br>  he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me <br>  shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,<br>  and will manifest myself to him."<br>  22. Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, <br>  "Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, <br>  and not unto the World?"<br>  23. Jesus answered and said unto him, <br>  "If a man love me, he will keep my words: <br>  and my Father will love him, <br>  and we will come unto him, <br>  and make our abode with him.<br>  24.

I am yet still in agreement with the article<br>  <br>  @answerer who assumes too much about Islam("kaboom" dork),<br>  "you also wish to remove all Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim in their entirity perchance?"<br>  Sahih Bukhari and Muslim are considered authentic only by a portion of the Sunni sect of Islam. You have completely missed out Shias, Many Sunnis, and Quran only's who dont believe at all in the authenticity of Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim<br>  <br>  As such I dont consider Bukhari a "Sahih" or reliable source, and we Shia Muslims have existed 200 years before Bukhari was even born...<br>  <br>  @asker, use your logic how could I deny something that did not happen? How can I be ashamed of some thing that has not happened? Can you not value the fact that there is a huge proportion of Muslims that know that the marriage did not take place at the age of 6. Tell me why would Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) marry someone older than himself.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you heard it right (although none of those Anti Islamic sites told you that), Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) first two wives were older than Him. Research it yourself if you dont believe me. here are the names <br>  Khadija bint Khuwaylid<br>  Sawda bint Zama<br>  <br>  Let me ask you simply:<br>  What point does it make to marry someone older than you if you are a pedophile in the first place?

The fact of the matter is that Muslims are not that dumb and most do not believe in such ridiculous beliefs. Furthermore, the causes of terrorism are much more complicated.

Please stop hating insulting another religionWe are the same as Allah's creation why you hate and insult Islam and its followers ?<br>  Your conclusion is wrong. Muhammad pbuh proposed the marriage is not the marriage itself.He proposed the marriage of Aisa at her age of 6 years old. But Muhammad pbuh got married with her at her age 9 years old. .Nine year for a girl who has experienced of monthly period in Islam is regarded as grown up.or mature.You could not measure the habit on those days with the habit of marriage of today. In the era of Muhammad pbuh there was a tradition for getting married since childhood,but now usually we are married more than 25  to 30 years oldEverything has been changed in line with the development of culture.<br>  We would not tell the story of old ages to our children,but we will tell them the condition of marriage now in line with the culture and also with law and regulation.In Indonesia we have the marriage law where the bride should be at least 16 years old.<br>  If we talk about Aisha at her era,she was a very beautiful daughter of Abu Bakar the first close friend of Muhammad pbuh.This marriage was intended for  making more tight relationship..Aisha was not forced to be married to Muhammad pbuh although the age difference was so far.<br>  Aisha loved Muhammad pbuh and Muhammad loved her very much.He called Aisha as the red cheek and in fact Aisha did not remarried after Muhammad pbuh passed away at her age of 18 years oldShe at her age 83 years old as widow of Muhammad pbuh.|`|MhbEQoJYaa	Arent people like you sick of asking the same Q all ova n ova again??<br>  <br>  <br>  Even after people give Q like this good answers, it would still be ignored.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I am not ashamed of the fact that the Prophet Muhammad (saw) married Aisha (ra).

You are forbiddent to inherit women against their will." - Surah An-Nisaa' (Chapter 4:19) <br>  <br>  Women around the world had no rights in those days and men knew no limits in their dealings with the women. One of the problems was that a man could marry off his daughter at any age and she could not refuse. <br>  <br>  Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, was offered the marriage to Ayesha by her father and mother on more than one occassion. Once when Ayesha was six, her mother summoned her into the house where she heard the proposal of marriage being offered by her father to his life long friend, Muhammad, peace be upon him, as was the custom of the Arabs in those days. Muhammad, peace be upon him, did not accept this offer at that time, even though it was customary for them, as she was not yet of age. <br>  <br>  [Note: her father is the one offering the marriage to his lifelong friend (Muhammad, peace be upon him)] The prophet, peace be upon him, did not marry her and take her to his home at the time and she says she returned back to place outside. <br>  <br>  NOTE: She did not marry him and returned to her friends and went back outside to play. <br>  <br>  A few years later when she was old enough to marry according to Islam (she was able to bear children) she did accept the proposal of marriage and she did marry the prophet, peace be upon him. <br>  <br>  We find that the girl must be old enough to have children and to be able to determine what her will is. The prophet, peace be upon him, married her at the youngest age a girl can get married. That is, she was old enough to be considered eligible for marriage and having enough wisdom to make such a choice even at her young age. <br>  <br>  Also, she was a virgin. This was to show Muslims about how to treat the young girls when they get married and not to rush into having sex with them until they are ready and fully prepared.<br>  <br>  All of this is recorded in the hadeeths narrated by Ayesha herself in regard to the treatment that she received from the prophet, peace be upon him. <br>  <br>  Ayesha was also given the distinct title of "Mother of the Believers" even though she never had a single child. Allah did honor her so much for her patience and dedication. <br>  <br>  Finally, Ayesha, may Allah be pleased with her, tells us in her own words all about the offers of marriage from her father to the prophet, peace be upon him, and of the actual marriage when it did take place years later. She also describes in glowing terms their engagement, marriage, life together and life after his death - all in the best of terms. She never said a single bad thing against her husband and described him as the best of men and the example of the Quran itself. She learned from him and passed on the most valueable knowledge of family relations in general and marriage in particular through her explanation of her own relationship of our prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. <br>  <br>  She tells of running races and playing together, enjoying sporting and competion events together, and mentions her personal intimacy with prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, in the most wonderful terms. Her advice and instructions to both men and women regarding establishing and maintaining the best relationship between man and wife is still the best of counsel we find today. <br>  <br>  As noted above, even Allah the Creator and Sustainer of the universe, has defended her honor and integrity in His Book. Her own account of marriage to prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and her many detailed descriptions of events and happenings before and during their marriage and her continued committment to the memory of her husband and faith in their reuniting together in Paradise can only lead us to believe, in fact, this was indeed the best of marriages in human history. <br>  <br>  A muslim men can marry a women after she has reached her puberty and with the agreement of the women herself not by force. Refer back to the 1st part which is the verse in Quran.|`|GHObdosFaa	Haha!! dude, you got the wrong info. Not surprising though since that's the nature of YOU people to post stuff like that without researching, not your fault though. No one knows how old she was but one thing's true that when she was 9, the Prophet already decided he WOULD marry her but only when she's mature enough to come to an appropriate age, not when she's just a child playing with toys...so there you go...think before you ask.|`|AA10736671	this is not the fact its only a distoration of history by some fake narrations by Hisham bin Marwa who narrated the history 200 years after the death of Prophet. He was above 85 years old when he narrated this thing. he is the only guy whom we see in the islamic history who narrated this fake thing. "" wazeer is cool"" has clearly proffed that it was a wrong thing which has erupted in our Islamic history. i have some proof from Quran that he never married her at the age of 6 or 9. pls read it carefully. thanks<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer this question that Muhammad married aysha at the age of 9 or not, we have to see Quran that whether God permits any body to marry a girl at young age or not?<br>  <br>  There is a complete chapter in Quran in the name of woman. In Arabic ‚ÄúNisa‚Äù is used for adult woman, where as ‚ÄúTIFAL‚Äù and ‚ÄúRadeea‚Äù  is used for a small kid. Even God didn‚Äôt use the word ‚ÄúShaabba‚Äù which is used for young lady. God used ‚ÄúNISA‚Äù which clearly denotes woman. See below verses:<br>  <br>  4:3. If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, Marry women of your choice, Two or three or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or (a captive) that your right hands possess, that will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.<br>  <br>  In the above verses God tells us to marry woman of their own choice. Here again God used the word woman and not baby. So it is a clear indication that God has fixed the age to puberty. <br>  <br>  See another verse from same chapter:<br>  <br>  4:4. And give the women (on marriage) their dower as a free gift; but if they, of their own good pleasure, remit any part of it to you, Take it and enjoy it with right good cheer.<br>  <br>  Here again God used the word woman and not a kid.<br>  <br>  Let‚Äôs see one more verse from same chapter:<br>  <br>  4.6. Make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage; if then ye find sound judgment in them, release their property to them; but consume it not wastefully, nor in haste against their growing up. If the guardian is well-off, Let him claim no remuneration, but if he is poor, let him have for himself what is just and reasonable. When ye release their property to them, take witnesses in their presence: But all-sufficient is Allah in taking account.<br>  <br>  Again here God clearly mention the age of marriage and that is puberty. <br>  <br>  There is one more place where God clearly tells us the age of marriage and that is the chapter of divorce <br>  65:1. O Prophet! When ye do divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed periods, and count (accurately), their prescribed periods: And fear Allah your Lord: and turn them not out of their houses, nor shall they (themselves) leave, except in case they are guilty of some open lewdness, those are limits set by Allah. and any who transgresses the limits of Allah, does verily wrong his (own) soul: thou knowest not if perchance Allah will bring about thereafter some new situation. <br>  Here u can see God is telling us the rule of divorce and its clearly mentioned woman and not a kid. This whole chapter of about rules of divorce and u can‚Äôt find even a single verse which tells us about kids divorce. The whole chapter is about woman.<br>  <br>  One more verses from Chapter 33. The Clans, The Coalition, The Combined Forces<br>  33:49. O ye who believe! When ye marry believing women, and then divorce them before ye have touched them, no period of 'Iddat have ye to count in respect of them: so give them a present. And set them free in a handsome manner. <br>  Here again God has used the word woman and not a girl. He told us the rule of marriage, divorce and period of iddat.<br>  <br>  Here one question arises why God didn‚Äôt mention the age of marriage in numerical form the main reason is the entire regions of the earth got different level of puberty. In Cold countries girls enter late into puberty age while in hot weather countries girls enter quite early it may vary from 16 ~18. Now it‚Äôs the duty of the local law maker that they should fix the age of marriage according to their own needs.  But God clearly fixed the age of marriage to puberty. And all above verses clearly advised us to get married when reached to puberty age.<br>  <br>  Now I come to your question: Please tell me how come Prophet of God who came to this earth ignored God‚Äôs rules of marriage and married to a kid? That is not possible that a messenger himself violets the rule and asked others to follow God‚Äô saying. All the misconception is due to some false and fabricated hadith. And some historical error due to false saying of an old man Hisham ibn `Urwah (‚Äúsun flower tolerance is the key‚Äù has already elaborate in her answer) In fact God‚Äôs messenger can‚Äôt ignore the message of God.<br>  <br>  And if still some Muslim insists that the hadith of the age of Aysha is correct, then asked him to marry his small daughter age 7 to any 60 year old guy. As Muslim believe that all the acts of prophet is sacred and following those acts is to follow sunnah. U will see the result if u|`|NlQhkgFCaa	What was the age of Aisha (ra) when she married Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and on what do you base this? <br>  <br>  What age do you think she was when she got married? <br>  (1)- Many Muslims believe that she was 6-9 years old when she married and they base this upon the Hadith. Whilst I do not reject Hadith, I have always felt that all Hadith should be subjected to greater scrutiny based upon more parameters one such being mathematical conformity**. <br>  <br>  (2) - 16-19 proof: Having done research, some mathematical reasoning and having read the following scholarly articles <br>  <a href="http://www.maraisburg.co.za/index_files/Page2506.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maraisburg.co.za/index_files/...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.iiie.net/node/59" rel="nofollow">http://www.iiie.net/node/59</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslim.org/islam/aisha-age.ph...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Articles.asp?ref=ic0811-3718" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamicity.com/articles/Artic...</a>  and viewed the following video <a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=NyqV7D7q5lE&feature=related," rel="nofollow">http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=NyqV7D7q5l...</a> it became clear that her age was much greater, either 14-20 or 16-19. Through mathematical deduction this is abundantly clear. <br>  (2) - 16-19 proof: Consider that Aisha (ra) had a sister whose name was Asma (ra) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asma_bint_Abi_Bakr" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asma_bint_A...</a> who was 10 years older than Aisha (ra). This sister Asma (ra) died at an age of 100 years in the year 73(AH), as such this logically means she was born in the year 27(BH), if she was supposed to be 10 years older than Aisha (ra) it threfore logically means that Aisha (ra) was born in the year 17(BH) and since we are told she married our beloved Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) a little after the Hijrah (1AH) <a href="http://www.anwary-islam.com/prophet-life/holy-p-Events%20.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.anwary-islam.com/prophet-life...</a> it clearly means she was 18 years old when she got married. <br>  - Alternatively, one can look at this same proof in another way as we are told that Aisha (ra) died in the year 58(AH) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aishah</a> and her sister Asma died in the year 73(AH) aged 100 which means there is a 15 year gap between the years of death for these two sisters and as such it means that Asma (ra) was 85 years old when her younger sister Aisha (ra) passed away and logically it means that Aisha (ra) had to be 75 years old when she died, as such if she got married some 57 years earlier it means once more she was 18 years old when she got married. <br>  (3) 14-20 proof: Consider also that Fatima (ra) was 5 years older than Aisha (ra) as mentioned In Asad Al-Ghaba‚Äôs collection of traditions (volume 4, page 377) it is reported: Fatima (ra) was about 5 years older than Ayesha (ra). Okay, now we know that Fatima (ra) died in the same year as her father Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) ie: 11(AH) and the most accurate age at which she is considered to have died is 30 as per the following "Zubair bin Bakar narrated to Abdallah bin Al-Hasan that he was with Hisham bin Abdulmaalik and Kalbi. Hisham made an inquiry of Abdallah, "How old was Fatima bint RasoolAllah?" Abdallah replied, "30 years old." After this he asked Kalbi the same question and Kalbi replied, "35 years old." Upon hearing this Hisham said to Abdallah, "Listen to what Kalbi is saying," and Hisham gave more importance to Kalbi‚Äôs testimony. Then Abdallah said, "Oh ameer al-momineen! Ask me about my mother and ask Kalbi about his." (Istia‚Äôab, vol. 6, pg. 752) " So if she died at age 30 it means that Aisha (ra) would have to be age 25 and since she got married some 10 years earlier, it would mean she was 15 when she got married and if one were to go by Fatima (ra) being 35 when she died as above, it would therefore mean that Aisha (ra) would have been 20 when she got married. <br>  -Alternatively. Also as mentioned above in Asad Al-Ghabaa's collection of traditions (volume 4, page 377) it is reported:<br>  Fatima (RA) was about 5 years older than Ayesha (RA). <br>  Hence, to find out Aisha's (ra) birth date we must find out Fatima's (ra). <br>  "Abbas went to Ali's house, and Fatima was saying to Ali that she was older than him. So Abbas told Fatima that she was born in the year the Quraish were building the Kaaba and Ali was born a few years before that" (Al-Ghaba, vol. 4, pg. 280). <br>  Fatima (ra) was born in the year the Quraish were building the Kaaba and when the messenger (pbuh) of Allah was 35 years old (Al-Ghaba, vol. 4, pg. 377) <br>  Fatima is the daughter of RasoolAllah. Khadija was her mother. Fatima was born in the year the Kaaba was being built, and that was 5 years before the nabuwwah (Tabqaat ibn Saad, vol. 8, pg. 11). <br>  We all know our Prophet (pbuh) was 40 years old when he received Nabuwwah and he was approx 54 when he married Aisha (ra), as such from above if Fatima was 5 at the time of nabuwwah, it means Aisha (ra) who was born then would have then been 14 when she married our Beloved Prophet (pbuh) some 14 years later<br>   <br>  So here we have it, 3 ages for when she married, (1) 6-9 years, (2) approx 16-19 years, (3) 14-20 years. Two out of three of the above logical deductions show she was a teenager when she got married and not a child, hence we can safely deduce that the greater likelihood is that she was a teenager and therefore mature when when she married, we will never know her exact age for sure but logical deductions clearly prove she was a teenager and not a child. Salam to all of you<br>  <br>  <br>  In conclusion, it is clear that Aisha (ra) was both physically and mentally mature when she got married. Clearly those who choose to attack our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) by claiming he married a child should think again. Pls note, Im not against Hadith, however we have to be honest with ourselves as Muslims-Hadith does lack the same levels of Quality compilation and authenticity as our Glorious Quran does. Our Quran is perfect and I have always felt that Muslims always tend to rely more on Hadith than on our Quran. All Hadith are not wrong, most have been excellently compiled and authenticated by our Scholars but what has been done in this question is resolving ambiguities in order to find the truth on this matter which clearly shows Aisha (ra) not to have been a child when she got married & I challenge anyone Muslim or non-Muslim to prove me wrong on this. <br>  <br>  Allah knows best <br>  <br>  ** My view on Hadith <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AoL2bqO.J.8jx6OjYaXcwa_ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081102170522AArISDM">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|kpoPY3ZHaa	Those time it was regular to marry a 5 or 6 years old.

It also left me with more questions about their sincerity than assurances that they might be genuine - coming out with radical claims like "If we destroy Christianity we will be blessed, we are winning the war," etc. Then they come out with claims like "Satan informs me the war is already won", etc. So why bother fighting?

For example, in a horse race, if the second horse follows the first horse so closely that its head is always overlapping the first horse‚Äôs body, then it is called Al-Musalli, and the first horse is called Saabiqun. [Taj-al-‚ÄòUrus, vol. 10, page 213; Lisan-al-‚ÄòArab, vol. 7, page 398.] Therefore, Salaat means to follow Allah closely. The only way we can follow Allah is to follow His Book, Al-Quran, to remain within the limits imposed by it, and never to transgress these limits. This implies that we have to establish a system so that we lead our lives according to the Code enshrined in the Quran. Establishment of this system is referred to as Aqeemus Salaat by the Quran. This is quite different from theocracy where religious leaders rule in the name of God using their own version of ‚Äòshariah‚Äô rather than the ‚ÄòShariah of God‚Äô, the Quran. "Woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say, "This is from Allah" - 2:79", so says the Quran about them.<br>  <br>  The Quran uses the term Aqeemus Salaat quite often which is usually translated as "Establish Prayer." This translation does not fully convey the meaning of the original concept. The root of Aqeemu comes from ‚Äòqaa-ma,‚Äô which means to stand, to be balanced, to have a just, fair and long-term strategy for dealing with problems, and to be steadfast. Therefore, Aqeemus Salaat means "to establish Salaat" as a permanent and balanced system in which human beings can follow the Divine Code in all aspects of their lives individually, as well as collectively. This obviously requires an independent and sovereign land in which the Divine Code can be enforced as a living constitution. This is the essence of prayer and, in fact, an essential requirement for the establishment of Salaat. The Quran is very specific on this point when it says:<br>  <br>  "These are the people who, when they will have power in the land (24:55), then they will establish Salaat‚Ä¶" (24:21). <br>  We have seen that according to its root meaning, Salaat is a system and not a ritual.<br>  Praying is only one part,component of Salaat. When we finish our prayers in the Masjid, we are not done with Salaat. It is not something to do and finish. It involves every aspect of life, keeping it within the guidelines of the Divine Code twenty-four hours a day. And this has to be done within a system under a central authority according to the Quran. This system was originally established by our Prophet. This renewal boosts our psychological energy to come together and support each other towards the goals of the Quran. Salaat is the mechanism by which the Quran is implemented in mankind. This is how Allah‚Äôs laws can be engrained within us<br>  <br>   Verse from Surah Hashr,specify's Fay and not religious instruction or laws other than Glorious Quran<br>  along with the verse in Surah Hashr,one should read the following too<br>  <br>  8:41 You should know: "Of anything you gain, that one-fifth shall go to God and the messenger: to the relatives, the orphans, the poor, and the wayfarer." You will do this if you acknowledge God and in what We revealed to Our servant on the day of distinction, the day the two armies clashed. God is able to do all things|`|vnEdfxeVaa	I agree , it can be what you said , that's why I understand reformists when they say that . I believe all the ways lead to Allah as long as we try our best to be sincere in our worship  and  we try to make the prayer serves its purpose .|`|GzlckRcnaa	The Prophet Muhammad saw said,<br>  " I Have left you with two things, as long as you hold to them, you will never go astray, they are the Book of Allaah and My Sunnah "  (Collected by Imaam Maalik (Rahimahullah) in his Book Muwatta)<br>  <br>  So actually Islam doesn't only based to Quran but it must also be accompanied by Sunnah Nabi Muhammad saw.Quran doesn't say how the solah is done but the procedures of the solah is refered to Sunnah/hadith..Nabi Muhammad said to sahabats "Sollu kama ro aitumuni usolli" which means you have to do the solah the way like i do it.<br>  and then Sahabats follow n do the solah like the way Nabi did n now we are following Sahabats.<br>  there are two conditions which must be fulfilled so that our prayer will be accepted by Allah.sincerity n according to Quran&Sunnah..<br>  what i want to say here is we can't do solah like the way we want to but it must follow how Nabi Muhammad did it..|`|Ieqp1kIhaa	Dear,<br>  <br>  Peace be upon you.<br>  <br>  In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.<br>  <br>  Prayer are taught Physically to all followers by Prophet Muhammad himself during his period. The same way of prayers never change until today.<br>  <br>  Just read this, then you know that you are at about 52 years behind time.<br>  <br>  "it is more than any other book in the world. The Christian Bible may be the best seller, but nearly 250 million followers of the Prophet Muhammad read or recite long sections of Alcoran five times a day, every day of their lives, from time they can talk." (Charles Francis Potter, "The Faiths Men Live By, Kingswood, Surrey, 1955, page 81.)<br>  [now the followers of Prophet Muhammad are at about 900 million]<br>  <br>  Wabillahhitaufiq Walhidayah Wassalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahhi Wabarakatuh.|`|N8QLKpCMaa	you mean  "  SALAT "  ,<br>  <br>  yes it is just named as salat in holy Quran but way to offer is told in hadith & sunnah, you will get there ,<br>  then when imams got duty of religion, they taught is there way , all is acceptable to Allah.<br>  hmmm,<br>  so i say in hadith & sunnah way is told so we follow same what imams taught like <br>  ( maliki,  hambili , hanafi , Shaffi ).<br>  there is specific  way to salat that says that SALAT is the major difference b/w you & them ( non believers ).|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	BTW your Islam phobia could not stop Islam from spreading , logical thinking will always lead to Islam.|`|03Xx7l8Baa	This issue is, unfortunately, a continuous one. No matter what's being said or proof to be brought out people, majority, will stick to what they believe is true.<br>  <br>  Realize though that the Quran is a guide to all mankind since it's revelation till the end of time. And yet has never been changed. This miracle that the very words, that have been used to guide mankind from generation to generation, are chosen so that no matter who reads it, whether from the companions or today's society, can still understand it. The sun and stars being described as lamps. That was something they could understand at their time and yet totally correct for lamps are fueled by gas and yet by today's scientific advances we know that they are 'balls of gas' if you will. Many more examples to how these words are truly divine words. <br>  <br>  There is one hadith, i know it doesn't pertain to this subject but contains an important point I think we should all remember;<br>  <br>  --->Narrated Alqama: 'Abdullah (bin Masud) said. "Allah curses those ladies who practice tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and those ladies who remove the hair from their faces and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful whereby they change Allah's creation." His saying reached a lady from Bani Asd called Um Yaqub who came (to Abdullah) and said, "I have come to know that you have cursed such-and-such (ladies)?" He replied, "Why should I not curse these whom Allah's Apostle has cursed and who are (cursed) in Allah's Book!" ---> Um Yaqub said, "I have read the whole quran, but I did not find in it what you say." He said, "Verily, if you have read it (i.e. the quran), you have found it. Didn't you read: 'And whatsoever the Apostle gives you take it and whatsoever he forbids you, you abstain (from it). (59.7)<--- She replied, "Yes, I did," He said, "Verily, Allah's Apostle forbade such things." "She said, "But I see your wife doing these things?" He said, "Go and watch her." She went and watched her but could not see anything in support of her statement. On that he said, "If my wife was as you thought, I would not keep her in my company."  (Book #60, Hadith #408)<br>  <br>  ~-->Al-Hashr verse 7 says;<br>  Whatever spoils from the dwellers of the township Allah has bestowed on His Rasool (Messenger), shall belong to Allah, His Rasool, (Rasool's) relatives, and to the orphans, the needy and the travellers in need; so that it may not become the property of the rich among you. Whatever the Rasool gives you, take it and from whatever he forbids you, refrain from it. Fear Allah; for Allah is stern in retribution.<br>  Then the next two verses mention the good qualities of true muhajireen immigrants and ansar.<br>  ~->The verse before that says;<br>  As for the spoils of theirs which Allah has bestowed on His Rasool, you spurred neither cavalry nor camelry to capture them: but Allah gives authority to His Rasools over what He pleases, and Allah has power over all things.<br>  <br>  Now remember this sura was revealed after the battle of Bani An-Nadheer. (which took place after the incident of Bi'r Mau'unah, which occurred after the Battle of Uhud). So the beginning deals with the spoils of war. Then Allah mentions TWICE in this SURAH which is in the QURAN that He gives authority to the Messenger (pbuh) and whatever he says is good then do it, and what is bad refrain from it. <br>  Don't think anyone can argue with this point, correct?<br>  look ---- Quran agrees with Hadith, and Hadith agrees with Quran ----<br>  <br>  interesting? huh... now to get to the point mentioned about prayers<br>  <br>  You made a good notion of the Malikis. Understand that the only basis they have of doing this is because that is how they saw Imam Malik (may Allah have mercy on his soul, AR). But you have to understand his HISTORY.<br>  <br>  I have no doubt in my mind that he used to pray with his right hand over his left wrist over his chest. --- BUT --- that's kinda hard to do when your arms become dislocated, correct? <br>      "The result was that the Governor felt that he was encouraging the rebels. In consequence, Malik was flogged and his arm was dislocated."  <a href="http://www.muslimheritage.com/day_life/default.cfm?yearlist=1&Oldpage=1&ArticleID=471" rel="nofollow">http://www.muslimheritage.com/day_life/d...</a> (it's about half way down the article you'll read about his torture, which unfortunately the left out much of his suffering and his students).<br>  <br>  Therefor the 'malikis' think that by following his example they are praying the correct way. I don't think many of them realize that this is out of his control and he couldn't lift his arms, subhannaAllah.<br>  <br>  I think we've made clear how these 'particular methods' of followers can be mislead into thinking what they're doing is correct, while it may not be. <br>  <br>  Interesting to not that the Quran DOESN'T say pray. NO it says ESTABLISH prayer. There is indeed a difference.<br>  Okay proof, Surah Luqman (31) verse 17,<br>  O my son! Establish prayers, enjoin good and forbid the evil. Endure with patience whatever befalls you, surely, this shows your determination in conducting affairs. ??? = establish. <br>  <br>  How is it that we establish prayer should be the next question =), lol|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you. Yes Allah regulates in the Qur'an just only its principles that muslims should pray,pay zakat and fasting etc as has been instructed also to jews and christians.But Allah does not explain in detail how to make wudhu and pray. It is regulated in the sunnah or hadith of Muhammad pbuh.That is why Allah has instructed muslims to obey the Qur'an and hadith as the life guide.Allah also says in the Qur'an that we should comply to  the Qur'an and follow hadith. <br>   .Muhammad pbuh received the command for pray at least 5 times a day in the event od Isra and Mi'raj.The way or act of  wudhu and pray we should see and follow the way of Muhammad pbuh during his life.It is stated in detail in his hadith collected by very  trusted persons (Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim) Its practice is slight different but principally is the same among muslims.|`|E0lMycUeaa	you dont seem to understand the reason of the revelation of quran<br>  and the importance of sending a model (messenger) to apply it<br>  and act upon it<br>  <br>  if GOD wanted for every one to pray by his own way he wouldnt had sent prophets. we would had found the books in some  sacred place<br>  or see it descending from haven<br>  <br>  i imagine if this was the case you would find too many different sects.you see people different although every thing is clear what if it isnt.<br>  you know what you dont have to imagine you can just read about sufism to know what mankind would had done if this was the case<br>  <br>  if you believe in GOD follow him on his terms not yours<br>  <br>  thats is the reason of your creation<br>  BR<br>  basem|`|SCkhQc2Caa	There is no difference between the scholars about the obligates acts of prayer and basics of `Aqeedah of Islaam.<br>  <br>  All difference is between Fiqh and its related matters. <br>  <br>  All the way we perform prayer derives from the sunnah of Prophet Muhammad ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him).  <br>  <br>  In reality , any thing that derive from authentic Sunnah is permissible to follow.<br>  <br>  but what scholar differ in this is which way is most correct , which one is default etc... this is a matter of Fiqh , where different scholars understand it differently based on the evidence [ i.e Qur`aan and Sunnah]. <br>  <br>  even from one evidence different rules , ways etc.. can be extracted. because undertaking of the text varies person to person. <br>  <br>  what the Majority [ of Muslims] accept is most correct way as said by Prophet ( peace and blessing of Allaah be upon him) , follow the majority of Muslim , he also said that "My Ummah will not unite upon falsehood/error".<br>  <br>  so , what ever the Ummah [ here i.e  Al-Jamaa'ah] agree is Truth , what they disagree is either falsehood or need to more researched. <br>  <br>  It is also said that the difference between the scholar is a mercy from Allaah.<br>  _______________________________|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	God Almighty sent Mohammad (PBUH) in the form of a human being so that he might be a guide and leader to human beings in their social affairs, and in the acts and deeds by means of which they attain happiness in both worlds; and so that he might disclose to human beings the wonders of Divine art and His disposing power that underlie all occurrences and are in appearance customary, but in reality are miracles of Divine power. <br>  However Qur'an emphasizes the necessity to pray.We learn how to pray and many other types of worship from the life of our Prophet.<br>  The sublime verse,<br>  Say: ‚ÄúIf you do love God, follow me: God will love you <br>  proclaims in definite fashion just how necessary and important it is to<br>  follow the Practices of the Prophet (PBUH).<br>  The above verse says: ‚ÄúIf you love God, you will follow God‚Äôs Beloved. If you do not follow him, it points to the conclusion that you do not love God.‚Äù If a person loves God, it entails following the Practices of God‚Äôs Beloved. Yes, one who believes in Almighty God will certainly obey Him.

Even the frequency of prayers is ambiguous in the Koran.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, we now all know that Muhammad was in the process of working it out.  First the Muslims faced Jerusalem when praying and then Mecca.  <br>  <br>  Prayer is after all a conscious acknowledgment of our own vulnerability and that forces unknown and capricious will affect our wellbeing.  We therefore pray to forces unknown and capricious in the hope of securing our wellbeing.  <br>  <br>  If the mind could nod, bow, curtsey, genuflect, prostrate itself then that is what prayer also consists of.|`|nWB0NC9Iaa	Salam alkum<br>  <br>  Because I follow mohammad (Swsl) and because allah told us to follow him.

Here are the verses that describe the prayers. And you just cannot consider it ANYWAY !<br>  <br>  1-  Performing Ablution before Salat (A prerequisite):<br>  <br>  Ref. 5:6<br>  O you who believe, when you observe the Contact Prayers (Salat), you shall: (1) wash your faces, (2) wash your arms to the elbows, (3) wipe your heads, and (4) wash your feet to the ankles. If you were unclean due to sexual orgasm, you shall bathe. If you are ill, or traveling, or had any digestive excretion (urinary, fecal, or gas), or had (sexual) contact with the women, and you cannot find water, you shall observe the dry ablution (Tayammum) by touching clean dry soil, then rubbing your faces and hands. GOD does not wish to make the religion difficult for you; He wishes to cleanse you and to perfect His blessing upon you, that you may be appreciative.<br>  <br>  <br>  2-  Facing the Kaaba during the Salat:<br>  Ref. 2:144, 149, 150<br>  <br>  3-  Standing while Salat:<br>  Ref. 7:29<br>  Say, "My Lord advocates justice, and to stand devoted to Him alone at every place of worship. You shall devote your worship absolutely to Him alone. Just as He initiated you, you will ultimately go back to Him."<br>  <br>  4-  Devoting the prayer ONLY to God:<br>  Ref. 6:162<br>  Say, "My Contact Prayers (Salat), my worship practices, my life and my death, are all devoted absolutely to GOD alone, the Lord of the universe.<br>  <br>  5-  Nullification of prayer if one mentions or calls upon ANYONE else besides God:<br>  Ref. 6:162, 39:65<br>  <br>  [39:65]<br>  It has been revealed to you, and to those before you that if you ever commit idol worship, all your works will be nullified, and you will be with the losers.<br>  <br>  6-  Bowing and Prostrating:<br>  Ref. 48:29, 17:1, 3:43, 22:77<br>  <br>  7-  The Last act (Closing act) of salat is Prostration: Also the leader of the salat stands in front of the congregation of the Salat. Also people should avoid standing in front of the performers of Salat.<br>  <br>  Ref. 4:102<br>  <br>  8-  Call upon God with his beautiful names and Glorify him in Salat: Also, the tone of Salat should be NEITHER Silent NOR Loud. It should be Moderate:<br>  Ref. 17:110, 111<br>  <br>  9:  Ask God to save you from Hell :<br>  Ref. 25:65<br>  <br>  -----<br>  So the Salat is IN the Quran.|`|RVWyPicKaa	The methods in which all muslims generally pray is derived from the sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh).<br>  <br>  @Makaarim K: you tell him.|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	My view was always....all you have to do really is the basics...like prostration and face mecca....and the rest is following the prophets sunnah.   Its an easy sunnah to follow, so i have no objection with it.   <br>  <br>  I think also...you're suppose to keep concentrated while prayer.....mind shouldn't drift for even a second....but yet most of us don't...not 100% of the time.   So the sunnah sorta adds brownie points to even things out.  <br>  <br>  If you didn't follow his sunnah...you might pray toooo short....again loss of concentration is a factor.....so it gives us a basis of how to pray.  <br>  <br>  <br>  There is also the concept of unity...so again we should all be praying somewhat the same way.

AA11286455	To start, I think it's unlikely you're ever going to be able to explain anything such that she "gets it".  It's a rare accomplishcment via debate for those w/intolerant, ignorant viewpoints.  <br>  <br>  You've already taken a stand w/her on this topic.  Don't make yourself crazy or fault yourself bc you didn't "get through".  Kudos for simply speaking up.  <br>  <br>  Some possible responses:  <br>  <br>  --You've heard my point of view and I yours.  We're simply not going to agree here and neither of us is likely to change the other's mind.  I suggest we no longer discuss this topic.  And then refuse to discuss it.  Period.  <br>  <br>  For example, I'm strongly pro-choice and use this statement to shut such conversations down w/others who try to debate, convert, or "convince" me of the error of my beliefs or that right-to-life is the only way to go.  With such a direct statement, they usually shut up or can switch to another topic, allowing us go on being cordial.  <br>  <br>  --If you have further conversations on this topic, "call a spade a spade", so to speak.  Say directly:  I have trouble abiding *bigotry* towards anybody and then shut the conversation down.  <br>  <br>  I'm reminded of what happened on the battlefields of Viet Nam when white soldiers, esp. those from the southern U.S. states, were badly wounded, needed a blood transfusion in the field:  <br>  <br>  When they looked up and saw who was rolling up their sleeves to donate, they 'd strongly object.  The medic would say you need a transfusion or you'll die.  Suddenly the white soldier had an "epiphany".  It may / may not have totally changed their racist views, but I'll bet they thought twice bf they ever called someone a ****** again.  <br>  <br>  I believe most social change and growth really does come from personal interactions with the "OTHER", esp. when there are high stakes involved.  Since you can't engineer such, just ask who has helped YOU lately?   <br>  <br>  Google to find out what the percentage of the general population is gay.  I wouldn't "out" any specific person you know, but I'd absolutely remind her of the statistical probabilities:  <br>  <br>  **Who was on the medical team that saved your cousin's life after falling into a pool and nearly drowning?  <br>  <br>  **Who donated blood for your mother's operation?  Can you be sure they weren't gay?  Did you know that out of the general population, gays make up one of the largest donation groups?  Hmmmm, hope you don't get into any bad car accidents....<br>  <br>  **Who may have served you in a store and helped find that faaaabulous prom dress?  Hell, who probably DESIGNED the freakin' dress?  Are you going to hunt the designer down and give him/her the 3rd degree and decide not to buy based on their orientation?  How stupid is THAT???  <br>  <br>  Who gave you great make up tips at Nordstrom's so you'd look cute on your hot date?  <br>  <br>  **Which closeted soldier could it have been in Iraq who saved your brother's life or limb from an IED and/or took the hit him- or herself?  Whoever it was, YOU OWE THEM--a debt of gratitude and thanks.  <br>  <br>  **What closeted or open citizen (or first responder for that matter) died trying to save others during 9/11?  <br>  <br>  **Ask how come all these 'other" people don't count as human beings worthy of dignity and respect?<br>  <br>  --Personally, I truly believe that racism and homophobia are mental health issues for the racist / homophobe and that these people have a form or level of mental illness.  The more rabidly racist or homophobic, the more ill they are.  <br>  <br>  I also believe that these people are a direct cause of mental health issues and problems for their targets--whether it's financial losses, social ostracism, emotional distress, etc.  You name it.   <br>  <br>  Depending on your nerve, just state the above and then say:  <br>  <br>  **Let's not have this conversation.  I have a policy of (or just don't believe in) getting into arguments with people I consider mentally ill, so let's change the subject.  TYVM.  <br>  <br>  Now say this depending on whether you really want to keep this "friendship" or bc it does have SOME redeeming value to you.  It should certainly shut her up.  Quick.  <br>  <br>  OR <br>  <br>  **People who are gay realllly seem to bother (unhinge) you.  Why is that?  Why are you soooo *threatened* by gay people?  <br>  <br>  Naming their behavior or response clearly, can force them to stop, think, and examine more closely their behavior, beliefs, and what FACTS they have to base those actions/beliefs on.  <br>  <br>  They also must look at how weak or "running scared" they seem to others.  And, no one really likes to appear or to publically admit that they're afraid or weak.  This may shut her up quick again.  <br>  <br>  If she has the nerve to try to respond "bc of what they do...."  <br>  <br>  Follow up with:  <br>  <br>  **What does it matter to YOU what ANYbody does behind closed doors and each person is consenting?  How can you possibly be hurt by it?<br>  <br>  **Has any gay person EVER propositioned you?  If they did, were you actually, really harmed--except in your own mind????  <br>  <br>  **Don't you know how|`|jNwkgcTCaa	Some people are just that way.<br>  You can't change their opinion.<br>  Just move on.|`|OJIZQYDcaa	There's no rule that says you have to like anyone.

I really like the nature aspect of it and have something similar in my own life and faith. Please let me know if I got something wrong there."<br>  <br>  As a Wiccan for over 20 years, my primary focus is to come to know my gods better... knowing myself, knowing the world, observing nature is part of that but the gods come first.<br>  <br>  I don't bother with things like spells. Many new fangled Wiccan books don't know the difference between celebrating the gods and purporting to turn one's boyfriend into a toad....luckily I never needed to use such blathering newbie authors.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't purport to channel anything...and I don't have anything to do with Satan. Christians, not Wiccans, are the ones going around talking about Satan this and Satan that. Goodness...many Christians talk about Satan far more than they speak of Christ....maybe Christian isn't the best term for their faith, as Christ is clearly *not* their focus....I mean, look at that answer down there...the guy can spell Satan fine, but Jesus he spells wrong...sheesh.|`|dFBccLExaa	You ought to try reposting this under the mythology board... you might get better responses. Whether a Wiccan practices magick or not comes and goes, depending on who you're talking to. Many Wiccans I've met feel the need to practice weekly, while others are lucky if they even think about magick. it just really depends. As to what draws a Wiccan to work with magick, it's probably more because it's there. There isn't anything that says you must, or says you shouldn't, bit since magick is pretty standard in the lesson plan of learning Wicca, most people learn it, and make use of it because it's there. <br>  That's the closest I can get to an answer for you. <br>  For myself, yeah, I can feel when magick works. But then again, I also have a lot of patience to wait for it to work, which is something many peolpe seem to lack (not specifically Wiccans). For myself, I really don't do a lot of magick. I don't see the point. I realize that the gods will take care of me, and if I just pay attn. to the world around me, the right path will reveal itself- no magick needed :) But then again, I'm not Wiccan.|`|4wLbuw1baa	UNFORTUNATELY a large portion of wiccans fail to understand what the actual concept of "Mother Earth" is: the ancient pagan concept of "Mother Earth" made a fertility cult. When a wiccan fails to understand this and that it was all about having the best possible offspring and making a healthy, strong community their whole concept of paganism & magic is completely out of whack. Very, very few reconstructionists (and even fewer neopagans/wiccans) generally grasp this concept and fail to perform the duties of their religion.

So, here come the immigrants, who are used to working for measly amounts, to your company, your company sees that they want to work, and are willing to work for way less than what your company was paying you. The company saves money and the mexicans have jobs!!|`|d198c889f69d9e7d47a46d267f12ba99aa	If you are saying that you were let go illegally, you have a case and could take it up with the ACLU.  They have, in many cases, acted as the poor man's union.  On the other hand, if you mean that the company closed that particular location or sold it to another company (assuming that this business location is within the US physically) and the opened another facility in Mexico in order to take advantage of the lower wages (about $1-$4 per hour in most cases) then they are within their rights and you would have to go back in time and alter our country's decision to allow 'free borders'.<br>  We have to make a decision in this country.  Do we want closed borders (that works both ways and means that we have a hard time selling our goods outside the country) and pay $12 per gallon for milk?  Or do we open our borders to cheap goods and cheaper prices in which case we can't afford to keep paying the super high American wages to produce the same products.<br>  It is a two edged sword.  It's ugly and it's painful.  It means that the era of the high paying Unions is a thing of the past and is on the way out.  We can't afford them anymore if we want to buy a car for $18,000!  Only if most Americans will buy only top dollar American made goods (like we tried to do in the 1970's and 1980's...and actually made a difference) can we make any headway in this economic battle.  <br>  I promise you this.  If you shop at Walmart, Kmart, Steve and Barry's or any other huge chain store that carries only imported goods from China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Mexico then you are bringing this on yourself.  It is hard to find any stores that are willing to carry American goods because most Americans will not pay the prices.  This is a war of will.  Not a war of economics as so many people believe.  We must have the will to produce our own goods or we well be a defenseless country in a time of war with the very countries that are the greatest threat to us.<br>  The answer is hard.  They are within their rights and it is not always a bad thing for our economy.  Secondly, the consumer drives the economy, not the other way around.  If you are a price shopper at all costs, then you put yourself out of a job.|`|yxtj5LUaaa	Yes, its screwed up. Weve been talking about this very subject for awhile now.

As a Hoosier myself I see them everywhere from the the cities to the small towns like the one I live in. There is alot of agriculture here so their is a heavy demand.

The number around here is so great that the grocery store in my home town has devoted a whole  isle to south of the border foods and ingredients within the last year.

lfnjwpu1aa	Absolutely!, I tend to blame it on advertising and the media. The advertisers lead people to believe that by taking one little pill, they will solve all their problems with aches and pains, growing older, look better and feel more attractive.<br>  Our bodies are beautiful pieces of machinery...and we keep feeding it anything that we deem will help it to run better.<br>  The public is gullible enough to think that if they buy this particular exercise machine their body will tone up and become superman. They forget about the old fashioned way of eating correctly and exercise. The one answer was right on the money, your natural defenses become so accustomed to the pills and medicine that your natural immune system will get confused and not be able to fight off infections.<br>  Make up is the one that really tickles me, the young ones wear it to look older, and the older ones wear it to look younger.<br>  Medicine and antibiotics have their place but yes, over use is a real problem....thank you that was an excellent question.|`|PR28wVHzaa	I think that people two hundred years ago would love to have access to the medications we have today.|`|vOwfC1SJaa	I think that the people who put that much drugs in their body will pay for it later on in life. I only take medication when absolutely necessary (bacterial infections).|`|OUBuIKDMaa	Not only sad but it weakens people's immune systems to take drugs for things that their bodies are naturally able to fight off but people take them anyways because they're too impatient to wait.

You do get what you pay for. Some things that are very inexpensive are built cheaply and are of poorer quality. Sometimes I'm brand conscious too. Especially when it comes to electronics.

31c41a175c5f539e0876998e50e5de35aa	I'm one of the ones that misunderstood you the first time you asked this question.  Thanks for rephrasing it...and I think now I get it.<br>  <br>  You want to know if your str8 friend (a girl that has a boyfriend) was indirectly supplying you with a hint that she might have some gay tendencies?  (2 answers):<br>  1) Yes, your str8 friend admits she may have some slight outward gay tendencies, but admits her gay friend has even more outward gay tendencies.<br>  2) No, your str8 friend assumes you know she has NO outward gay tendencies. So her self-comparison to her gay friend is indicating that the gay friend has almost unnoticeable, slight outward gay tendencies.<br>  <br>  According to the Kinsey Scale, most people are not 100% heterosexual, nor are they 100% homosexual.  There is a lot of gray area in between the two fixed points.  Your "str8" friend may very well be just a smidge off the "str8" mark ... but not too far away,... so it's safe to continue referring to her as being hetero.|`|8b7f8e496ede0dcde287f7fa3adf10c8aa	y you even worrying about it?|`|9HvvegP5aa	I think you are reading too much into. As I don't know your friend very well, but my guess is, she is simply trying to make sense of it.

That's why you are not getting any answers.  I have no idea what your question is.|`|0Ge9NcDpaa	I think you are thinking too much & she is not comparing gay to gay but gay to herself which is probably straight. Sorry dear one!

b9f6e83087281c78e4e84187d3f69e81aa	The term Hell is translated from two different words: "Hades‚Äù or the place (state) of departed souls<br>  "Geenna" or valley of (the son of) Hinnom; gehenna (or Ge-Hinnom), a valley of Jerusalem, used (figuratively) as a name for the place (or state) of everlasting punishment: - hell.<br>  <br>  Jesus said:<br>  Mat 5:22  But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. <br>  <br>  Mat 5:29  And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <br>  <br>  Mat 5:30  And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. <br>  <br>  Mat 10:28  And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. <br>  <br>  Mat 11:23  And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. <br>  <br>  Mat 16:18  And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. <br>  <br>  Mat 23:15  Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves. <br>  <br>  Mat 23:33  Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? <br>  <br>  Luk 12:5  But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. <br>  <br>  Luk 16:23  And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.|`|AA11476749	Matthew 5:22 is one,  "But I say to you, anyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be subject to punishment. And whoever says to his brother 'Raka!' will be subject to the Council. And whoever says 'You fool!' will be subject to hell fire."  <br>  <br>  The word "hell" here (and in others that I will mention) is a transliterated word derived from the Hebrew word "Ge Henna" (Pronounced gheh'-en-nah) and is Strong's Ref. # 1067.  It means valley of (the son of) Hinnom; ge-henna (or Ge-Hinnom), a valley of Jerusalem, used (figuratively) as a name for the place (or state) of everlasting punishment.  <br>  <br>  It was a perpetually burning garbage dump located outside the walls of Jerusalem, and was a stark reminder of the place of final punishment.<br>  <br>  There are many other passages where Jesus Himself referred to hell:  <br>  <br>  Matthew 5:29-30, 10:28, 18:9, 23:15, 23:33. <br>  Mark 9:43, 45, 47.<br>  Luke 12:5.<br>  <br>  There are others, but they weren't spoken by Jesus.  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Other passages that are translated "hell," are actually the Greek word "hades," which was the abode of the dead.  Prior to Christ's resurrection, both the righteous dead, and the wicked dead were there, but in separate areas.

V7rA5yxjaa	I've been in this situation numerous times, for me it depends on the person. The only times I don't tell is if they're on such a restrictive diet that if they cut out one more particular food, they'd be in danger of being malnutritioned, then I leave it alone or when I don't feel it my place to be the bearer of bad news. <br>  Other than that, I usually tell them the truth. Mostly not because I'm such a great person, but opposite, I've found many of those who don't eat pork or beef have this sort of superiority complex, critical or holier than thou attitude when seeing others enjoying their meats, so I feel vindicated when I prove their hypocrisy. Besides it's fun watching their disgust kick in when they realize.|`|366aa3bbb60558f11aecb9d3750bceb2aa	I had this dilemma when a co worker ate a pie crust I made with lard.

V7rA5yxjaa	Couldn't answer you truthfully about the exact % since I don't know, but I can see how there's a lot of mid-westerners in Manhattan as there's definitely a disproportionately high amount of wasps than compared to the rest of NY boroughs or state. I think they are either concentrated in Soho, pockets of places near Wall St., mid town, Central Park East and West. But keep in mind there are A LOT of tourists also. All in all, it's hard to say though and while there may seem to be a high percentage of mid-westerners, locals still seem to dominate.

So Yes, you are psychic.<br>  <br>  The dreams are called Precognitive Dreams. <br>  <br>  Read as much as you can, find like minded friends (not those who wish to tell you about demons & all that) & go to what your drawn to.<br>  <br>  Sadhara|`|iTi26ojQaa	everyone has physic abilities. lets just say its part of every brain's hardware. since not many people believe in physic abilities, they don't even think about channeling that part of the brain. if everyone worked hard enough, we all could become physic.<br>  <br>  if you want, there are ways to make your physic mind stronger. like focusing all of your energy onto one object, for example, a small candle flame. you have to be relaxed, or it won't work as well, and you will strain yourself. you might even want to try meditating first, so you can be perfectly relaxed. then imagine energy flowing out of you. focus on the candle, and stretch your energy towards the candle flame. try to get it to split down the middle, or go to one side, and stay there. this will take a lot of practice, and determination. once you get that, try moving something a little heaver and build yourself up. this practices telekinesis.<br>  <br>  you can also try the next time someone calls, tell yourself who is calling you before you answer, (DON'T LOOK AT CALLER ID, THATS CHEATING) then answer, and see if you are right.

What we all need is to commit our way unto the Lord (Jesus Christ) and let him guide us.  That way we can find out what we were created for and he will help us use the gifts that he intended for us to have.  the gifts we have should be used for the right reasons, for the edification of the body of Christ and for the glory of God.  So, are you born again?  If not, then read the book of John 3 times and meditate on the Scriptures so that the truth will penetrate, and read a few extra verses about salvation too.  Not knowing whether you have a Bible, I will send you some.<br>  <br>  Salvation:<br>  <br>  As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one‚Ä¶.  Romans 3:10<br>  <br>  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20<br>  <br>  As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12<br>  <br>  Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19<br>  <br>  ‚Ä¶that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>  God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.  Rom. 10:9<br>  <br>  If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. II Corinthians 5:17<br>  <br>  So, pray and ask forgiveness and blessing.  Ask Jesus to come into your heart and be Lord of your life.  This is necessary.<br>  <br>  Marcia|`|ucfbktFfaa	im wondering the same thing. i cant predict future events or anything, but when it comes to people and feeling what they are feeling i do it all the time. i sense what they are feeling or thinking.|`|gYO8rLYFaa	i think there's no point in asking something like this.

25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Well......I don't dress like a bum except when doing heavy cleaning and yard work around the house, but if I received a wedding invitation that stated "formal attire required" I would have to turn down the invitation, so you might want to re-think your strategy. Honestly, all eyes will be on you and the wedding party, not the guest, so I suspect your cousin could wear anything except her birthday suit and she would probably not even be noticed by most. Give her some credit for knowing when to clean up her act and concentrate on something more important. If she comes dressed in her sweat pants and t-shirt, it's a reflection on HER, not you.|`|B24W8w43aa	Yes, formal attire.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	Yes...and if she has money issues possibly take her shopping.<br>  Tell her you want her to look her best because you plenty of pictures with you and her together, then pick out some items that you think would look best for her. <br>  <br>  If you don't want to go shopping then maybe look at a magazine with her and point out things that would 'look great on her'. Tell her 'this would look so good on you..you should get something like this to come to my wedding..everyone would die!" Just subtle hints that let her know without coming right out and degrading her.<br>  <br>  *congrats on getting married*|`|RDxbbCHwaa	Yeah, that way there's no confusion and it's on her. I've seen wedding invitations do that and I don't think it's rude or tacky. I've been to some non-formal weddings.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Yes formal attire is the best wording & as far as your cousin maybe you two could go shopping together tell her you want her advice & say to her Oh this would look great on you plan a girls' day  & Congrats to you|`|AA11119758	Yeah, put that on the invite and also maybe take her shopping.|`|fT6x5YChaa	Generally, I think that dressing up for a wedding should be common sense. However, in your case I think that it would be best to ask your cousin what she is planning on wearng on that day. If she says she is not sure or points out she wants to wear something lets say too casual, then you might suggest her going shopping together. If she agrees then great. Help her choosing a nice outfit. If she does not want to go shopping with you then you get some stuff for her and ask her to try them on. Also, you may ask her if she wants to be your bridesmaid, that way she needs to wear whatever the other bridesmaids are wearing. So, there would be less chance of her "surprising" you by wearing something unapproprate.  <br>  Good Luck! Congratulations for getting married!|`|veeC7Rvvaa	People who normally neglect their appearance can surprise you with their formal wear when they're invited to such an occaison.<br>  <br>  It's a wedding, it's daft to say formal attire required! I suggest you arrange someone (could be you) to take her shopping, and to chat to her in a friendly way about what she thought of wearing and doing with her hair. Often in weddings girls dress together and get their hair and make up done in the same house or beauty salon, so make sure she gets invited there.. Also, check if she has enough money!!!<br>  Finally, your cousin may dress like a bum, but you certainly sound like one.|`|rJNl12hQaa	Well, you know better your cousin than us. I don't know how old she is, but the best way to approch her is to talk to her as a reel friend. Express your feelings to her and don't fake anything. In that way she will understand your consern and sooner or later it will make sens to her. Be reel to her.<br>  Congratulation for your wedding.|`|bbr2v6Jkaa	Yes put that on the invite? But not to hurt her feelings you might ask her to go to shop with you and help her along with her wardrobe? Make a fun time of it if possible? She may lack the self esteem and need to have you there to spruce her up? Be kind, she might change for the fact that someone cares?|`|UdIybwRpaa	Yes and if she doesn't get the hint, don't let it ruin your day. It really is a small matter in the grand scheme of things.|`|Ih1Ds4cEaa	I wouldn't approach her because it may hurt your relationship with her.  I would put it in the invite.|`|f1ogWepcaa	yeah it says it all...

Como foi dito acima, compet√™ncia n?o tem a ver com op??o sexual, e ainda afirmo que nem com g√™nero. Mas deve acrescentar que a quest?o de gays ter uma condi?ao a mais √© prov√°vel sim, pois em geral tem uma possibilidade muito maior de se dedicar ao trabalho maior que a dos h√©teros. Pois quando se tem uma fam√≠lia, mulher e filhos e agregados, as vezes n?o podem dedicar-se t?o por inteiro e aqueles que o fazem, acabam divorciados ou sozinhos. Mas que √© verdade que o gay est√° mais aberto a intui??o, devida a sua experi√™ncia de vida, acaba conhecendo muito mais das rela??es humanas e sabe como usar isso (se tiver boa cabe?a), podendo se dedicar ao trabalho com apoio do pr√≥prio companheiro.

Super inteligente, apreciador de m√∫sica cl√°ssica entre outros atributos. Infelizmente o que eu notava nele, e que alguns homossexuais tamb√©m podem ter, √© a dificuldade de relacionamento. Acredito que a n?o aceita??o pela sociedade, trabalho e talvez dele pr√≥prio com a sua condi??o o faziam ficar confuso diante do mundo.<br>  Se eu estiver errada me ajudem a pensar melhor sobre o fato. Sempre conversei com ele, tentando deixar ele solto em rela??o ao assunto, mas ele sempre fugia de assumir o que era. <br>  Bem, mas a minha vis?o sobre a Intelig√™ncia vem muito do que aprendi no curso de Psicologia e na viv√™ncia di√°ria. Acredito que quem melhor se adapta as situa??es, est√° mais preparado para enfrentar os obst√°culos da vida.<br>  Nesse caso o homossexual na sua grande maioria √© reinvidicador, luta por suas causas, assume, fala e conseq√ºentemente √© mais criativo , inova,busca novas formas de viver a vida.<br>  N?o descarto por√©m que somos diferentes enquanto seres humanos, talvez alguns menos adaptados que outros.<br>  <br>  Um grande abra?o

We HATE that term.  Other terms we hate:  "it", "tranny", "freak", "chick with a d**k" or "man with a p*ssy", or "but you're not a REAL man/woman".  <br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, this makes me want to pull my hair out every time I see these slurs being used.  A gay or lesbian person would be offended if you called them "a carpet muncher" or a "peter puffer" or a "f*g" or a "d*ke"....so same thing applies. These terms and slurs are offensive to us.|`|01NUrwfYaa	any mexican gay club.<br>  there are many when I go.|`|B3ArssuQaa	There used to be a club I would go to in Phoenix called The Biz (short for ain't nobodies biz).  Not sure if it's still there.  Anyway it's actually a female club but I did see shemales in there.  Great club, lots of fun. If you decide to go...go with a female because they might give you a hard time getting in if you're a guy by yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	While I mostly agree with J.D, I myself am trans AND gay, and I don't mind the term tranny or f*g... As long as it's being used in a playful fashion and not as an insult. o.o;<br>  <br>  Aside from that... the term "shemale" largely refers to someone in the porn industry, and is typically considered extremely offensive. I'm sure there's at least one person out there who doesn't mind the term, but it's best to just never use it.|`|Td4LL4HSaa	transwomen.

q802CQnAaa	Work and school are large, general places. To find people with specific likes/dislikes would be like looking for a needle in a haystack.  If you wish to find people that like the things you do and share your views, look for social groups that revolve around those interests, or frequent places/events that these people would attend.|`|m2PlMByKaa	you're obviously cooler than everybody else.|`|buN06G6Daa	It is very difficult in these modern times to meet like-minded people.

Simple as that.|`|DwMU437uaa	He's racist and apparently had a dad that was racist or granddad that was. What i do with my grandad and my gf (who is creole mix of everything and yes she is gorgeous!!lol) is that i have him always doing something else like watching tv and playing cards or talking to some else. Ilove them both and i bet you love your step dad alot too but you can't make a person stop being racist. just tell your friend to ignore it and not get mad at your family.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you'll never change him, so don't try.  considering living away from the man and limiting your contact with him.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	Convince your mom that she married a moron!<br>  I roomed with a black girl in college..no, we didn't get a long and she was trashy and partied and like men-a lot!

Many white people do bad things, many black people do bad things, as well as latinos, asians, etc. It's not the color of your skin, it's how you were brought up.<br>  <br>  He has no class to be so rude right to her face.

He is entitled to not want her at his wedding regardless. It obviously made him uncomfortable and that is his wedding? However maybe you should have asked him first, for you did not want to hurt your friend eh? <br>  But it is over I gather and that is that. In the future he will have to respect your choices of friends, that you are entitled to your beliefs and associations, for she poses no threats to you and make your stand on that issue. Maybe he will change someday but I would not press the issue. However there are many prejudices in this world. Men that fought in the wars like the big one WW11 they still hate the Japs, and the Nazis? With much more reason they watched those people kill their friends, like Viet Nam vets as well as today the Iraqis? What about the Arabs and 9/11. So you see there are some people that harbor these feelings and there is nothing we can do but give them their space. But enforce your space as well in the future. There is vast cultural difference in this world and yet we are all humans, if we find a common denominator to bridge the gap between cultures that is a blessing, for then we learn from each other, but in some cases that does not happen. Many in this country right now see a threat with the Black issues, because of the President and the black people are posing a threat in some groups yes, they feel we owe them something from 200 yrs ago? And then the white people think that it is reverse discrimination and it is? But then we really don't owe anyone we were not alive then? And each person being a human should not ever have to be judged for their race, creed, religion, or color? I pray that someday we are so evolved we don't even recognize the difference like with Warf the Clingon in Star Trek? ha ha Get over it!|`|S1TkBsnnaa	You cannot change anyone. They have to change themselves. Try not to force the friend thing on him. I do not agree with his logic but know from my own experiences that in time it may all change and before you know it-he's changed. Of course there is that possibility that he may not. Let them be his beliefs not yours. Protect your friend from any future rantings. If she's a good friend she'll undersdtand it's not you. And advie to your friend kill him with kindness. Doesn't matter what century we are in, some ppl take a little longer to get places than others. His behavior is the really sad part. Good for you for taking a stand and not letting her leave alone. Good man!|`|8vshPwOPaa	you will never change his mind. explain to your friend you dont share his views and her family might be mean to you for a while, or forever. <br>  <br>  he has his own reasons for thinking these things. to him it makes sense. <br>  <br>  all you can do is adapt to the situation.|`|01WRofRVaa	i dont know but belive me the black people are so trust worthy and kind if u good with him...and our religion (islam) there are no difference in black and white people all are same...this all about on manner may be u get white...but what about his manner, i dont talk that white people are not good...|`|rFYy7cRyaa	that is sad. :(

Atheism is simply a belief that there is no god - nothing more.  However, Satan sets us free to be ourselves, good and bad, holding those together in responsible selfishness, and that works out to be much the same as how atheists act.  True enough I could quite easily be an atheist were it not for the fact that Satan exists.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	No Satan knows who God is.  Satan and all his demonic hosts fear and tremble at God because they know his true power and authority over them.  So Satan is by no means an atheist.   <br>  <br>  A human atheist does not acknowledge the existence of God at all.|`|ngew4AWSaa	Yes he does. He supports independence of thought, and the non-supression of sexual desire.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	satan, like his god, does not exist therefore he cannot BE anything except imaginary|`|11b70cab8a6a69fef89e99846ac0cc19aa	No.<br>  <br>  He fought against God, silly.

He suppose to believe in this god before he can suck his glory. <br>  <br>  Therefore, you fail logic 101.|`|K8QTdUnfaa	I guess I missed the memo.  Satan, who doesn't exist, doesn't believe in  god, who doesn't exist and has the same beliefs and ideals as atheists, whose only common ground is the non-belief in god and satan.<br>  <br>  <br>  ooookaay|`|v61VWKMDaa	What beliefs and ideals of atheism?  Atheism is only the lack of a god belief.  There is nothing more or less to atheism.<br>  <br>  If Satan exists, and is the Biblical one, then he would be a theist.  Because he knows there is a god.<br>  <br>  You fail.|`|fjAdjVhkaa	Oh yeah, because being an atheist means you support death and destruction and the defilement of the world. Atheists arent evil, they just believe in something different than you. Stop being so judgmental, who gave you that right? And please dont think a god did.|`|yu53u5TFaa	No. According to Christian mythology, Satan worked for God until he betrayed Him. An atheist is someone who does not think that God is a real being. Within the context of the story, Satan MUST think God is real.|`|Z92LPUqaaa	I'm fairly sure that if satan were real, he would believe in a God.<br>  <br>  There are no beliefs and ideals of atheism.. Either you have not done much studying, or someone has been deliberately misleading you.|`|rSautofoaa	atheism is the denial that God is real. Therefore, satan cannot be an atheist because he knows that God is real.|`|xRCynGQqaa	No.<br>  <br>  The Bible is quite clear on this:- "Satan believes in God and shudders".<br>  <br>  You can't believe in God & be an atheist.  Sorry.|`|Ve18FAnGaa	if satan was real then i would have to guess he is an anti-theist not an atheist.  he seems to have a position based on opposition ...of 'god.'|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	no, satan definetly know that GOD is real...|`|4e911a1a92f0524d87554578ea0e7544aa	If there's no God, then Satan is out of a job.|`|uxeWIEPFaa	wtf<br>  satan know's who god is they met eachother before.|`|m0xehTLqaa	no that makes no sense at all, because satan would know god exists|`|32P7VxUlaa	He believes that God exists himself, but likes the ideals of atheism.  Non-spiritual Satanists consider themselves atheists many times too.  Personally I am a Christian.  Any time Satan sees someone worship God he gets jealous, because he wants them follow his ideals, which are the desires of flesh.  Both God and Satan get jealous over us.  It's like a tug of war between good and evil (love and desire.)  God loves us, but Satan desires us.  Love is harder to find, but is much more powerful I'd say.

Did you know satan was an angel in heaven. Yep. Because at one point at time Lucifer was one of the best angels of worship and was right next to God but challenged God's authority and thought he should be God. God banned him and his followers to hell.|`|N6LWkw9Gaa	No. Atheist Do not believe in God, But Satan Does.<br>  <br>  James 2:19  KJV<br>  Thou believest that there is  one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.|`|SrSGgPoraa	doesn't make sense... if satan's real, then he knows a god cast him out of heaven, so he'd believe there's a god.  <br>  <br>  the only position in atheism is that you don't believe in gods|`|ffAwH6Seaa	the devil would most definitely believe in god , and he could quote you chapter and verse from the bible , after all he was there when it was written.|`|iu2hnHp7aa	*sigh*<br>  <br>  beliefs and ideals of atheism?

The stars were fueled up by fusion (conversion of hydrogen to other elements) and through the process of fusion other elements were formed. When the star finally died billions of years later, all those elements that were formed were released into space and the combination of all of those elements finally created earth and everything that is on it. Earth ended up to be close enough to the sun and far enough from the sun to be able to support life.<br>  So we are just mammals who leave on earth.

As the new creation is only a restoration of this image, the history of the one throws light on the other; and we are informed that it is renewed after the image of God in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness (Col 3:10; Eph 4:24).? ?|`|STLS9XXYaa	we are beings in a spiritual evolution,for the soul to become aware of it self. and we got here from millions & millions of years of evolution for the soul can manifest its self so it go back again until it becomes aware of it self.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	We are who we are, there is no why, and our parents did the horizontal tango.|`|aBWV0Pyraa	I can't Imagine.

They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved. 11For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie 12and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.<br>  <br>  <br>  The restrainer, the one holding him back is the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy spirit is lifted then the AntiChrist come to the scene.  That will happen at the rapture and we know it shall be before the great tribulations, read this:<br>  <br>  1 Thessalonians 1<br>  <br>  10and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead‚ÄîJesus, who rescues us from the coming wrath.<br>  <br>  <br>  Revelation 3<br>  <br>  10Since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	There is no rapture, this is false Scripture.

There have been lots of people who have died on the operating table, and while doctors tried to revive them, they would be standing there looking at themselves or something, one man even said he went to hell. It's possible to die and be brought back to life by doctors and has definitely happened before. We can't know whether what they're saying is true, we can only believe in heaven and hell ourselves. I would suggest bringing this up to your pastor and I'm sure he could give you a lot of information. :)<br>  <br>  P.S. I love Kyle and South Park!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Soldier for Salvation, South Park is in NO WAY anti-Christian. This show has very good morals. They disrespect and make fun of EVERYONE and EVERYTHING. The end of almost every episode concludes with a mature, responsible message about a good way to live our lives. I'm Christian and although I know they do make fun of them (out of 12 seasons I think I've seen it in two episodes, they make fun of liberals more), at least it's a show that can make me laugh and have a good time, and for the most part, does have good messages.

The only way to repent is to take Jesus' throbbing love member into the depths of your anus, thus preserving the sanctity of the flesh. Jesus...must...love you.

Let him penetrate your tush, for the good of God's children, your tookus will be our sacrificial lamb. Two thousand years from now, people will be hanging little statues of Jesus' wanker sliding into your poop chute and glorifying it as the second COME-ING of Christ.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Does not matter. The answer to god's existence is unimportant.<br>  <br>  I am what I am and what I am needs no excuses!<br>  <br>  People ask what would convince me that g-d truly exists. While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that g-d does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of g-d's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me g-d exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. Existence or not of g-d does not matter.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'√™tre?<br>  <br>  Atheists such as myself have real moral values perform mitzvahs not for the sake of salvation, but because moral codes and performing good deeds and helping those in need is the right thing to do. <br>  <br>  Many (not all!) people choose Christianity for the reward of salvation or to avoid the punishment of hell. That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all. To me, a true Christian would accept Christ without regard to salvation, would not crow about being saved, would not condemn others, and would even take that John 3:16 oath of allegiance knowing that g-d might hypothetically punish them.|`|tqA9kxeqaa	Don't be discouraged with all the lame answers on here.<br>  I say just be glad that YOU know what YOU know and all you can do is pray and hope that THEY would know it too.<br>  BUT asking a question like this is only going to get you disgusting answers like one I just read, and other answers that you weren't even looking for.<br>  It's ok though.

Then my husband<br>  will take his turn in the wee hours. And I will hear him going up the<br>  steps to the kitchen level and beyond. It shouldn't be a surprise, that<br>  both of us require a nap in the afternoon, or even late morning, as<br>  days like this, continue. There's no rest, even for the tame, and un-<br>  wicked.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	When I was young I could sleep up a storm, 10, 12 hours sometimes.

I occasionally take a sleep aid myself. My dad who is 85 sleeps about 5-6 hours, but 'catnaps' once a day in front of the tv. I've always thought a nap in the day is good for a person if they can do it. I can't, only if I am sick. If I drink caffeine in the evening it adds to the problem. I read a person should not consume any caffeine for several hours before bed, also exercising close to bedtime can keep one from going to sleep right away.

It is not that we are hated, it is that we are feared. The majority decides what is normal, the minority has to grin and bear the fact that they are not "normal". The fact is, everyone on this planet is a gossip queen, whether they voice their opinions out loud or not. <br>  <br>  Heterosexuals outnumber us because those of us that are young are too afraid to speak up and acknowledge who they are. Those of us that are older are afraid of losing their jobs and being slapped with a new identity. The fact of the matter is, there are no well spoken homosexuals to led us in the revolt against intolerance and injustice. <br>  <br>  The media portrays us as sluts, the churches portray us as demons...and our parents enforce it, not every parent, but just about. The fact is we are the underdogs in this society, the pariahs if you will... every society has them. people you can step on without having to feel guilty, and the fact that we even have pariahs in the united states, a country that was built on the ideals of many(not just one"person") is sad. I say person because it seems like middle America is content to just follow blindly whenever they are told to do something. <br>  <br>  I fear that acceptance might never fully come, but I hope to see the day when two little boys, or two little girls can hold hands and no one will swat away their dreams and call them dirty or impure. <br>  <br>  I dream of the day when people will let people just be, and not argue about every single facet of life...I just want peace.|`|7pKc4WKJaa	Because the world is full of close minded idiots and its pretty sad too.

NxLmvKtJaa	Part of making a great impresson is to learn basic words in the local language.  The Japanese will never expect you to be as fluent as they are.  But if you show that you can at least say thank you, good morning, or excuse me in their language they will be impressed.  In fact, if you show them the courtesy of speaking in their language, they will return the courtesy to you and try and speak English.  Suprisingly, they are more fluent in English than you might expect.  I know, I'm currently stationed in Japan.  Never fear, the ones who are most impressed, will even try to help you pronounce it.  have fun.|`|CLCSL042aa	I wouldn't worrier to much about  what people will think.I would try an take a look at how do I feel about myself .

For instance, saying the rosary can put your mind at ease through the repetitive utterances and relax you so that you are able to face the problem, in other words, even if it does not communicate with G-d, it can put yourself in a state of mind that will allow you to deal with the problem regardless.<br>  <br>  You might want to try a bit of traditional meditation as well, as prayer as I have always known it, is a sort of meditation, so there might be something there that can help you.<br>  <br>  But, I strongly believe that G-d helps those who helps themselves, he watches out for those who watch out for themselves.<br>  Sort of like,<br>  A man was in poverty, and all day and all night he prayed to G-d to give him help, but help never came, and he died a poor man.<br>  When he got to heaven, G-d asked him why he spent all that time praying when he had been given two good hands to work the earth, a mind to make investments, and legs to take him to places.<br>  <br>  Prayer is good, and it does help people, and I'm not trying to under-cut the importance of it, but there are more ways to pray than just saying "Jesus help me"<br>  Let the work that you do be a prayer to the Lord.<br>  Offer up your failings to him, and tell him that they are things that you have learned.<br>  Let each step you take be a prayer of the beauty of the earth you walk on.<br>  Let each breath you take be a prayer of the wonder of life, so that as long as you breath, you will be praising the Lord.|`|yqUgRG2raa	-Our father which are in heaven (God is outside and inside of us)<br>  -Sacred is God's name (I call to God but know that God is outside my understanding)<br>  -Thy kingdom come, thy will be done (the future/past belongs to God)<br>  -on earth as it is in heaven (our lives have good times/in heaven and bad times/outside of heaven)<br>  -Give us this day, our daily bread (our survival depends on God)<br>  -And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us (God treats us the way we treat others)<br>  -And lead us not into temptations for thine is the kingdom and the power and glory forever.

Sometimes, these times are not caused by our mistakes, then we must have the desire to control the situation and steer toward good results for everyone.<br>  If you need money, ask for insight on how to earn money.

If you work downtown, you can hit up Sambuca's, its a live music club/happy hour/restaurant. In there you will find a blend of professional women and men and its laid back (all races). They also have a cigar lounge upstairs if you're into that, its great, I like it alot. Happy hour is m-f, 4-7. Try the Redbull-tini!<br>  <br>  I also fall into Cody's on University (between Kirby/Morningside).

ca4ed140a6433f60bc05c2d63b2e498eaa	1) It was passed by the voters TWICE. True. I honestly doubt that the judges will overturn this ruling. Even if they are liberals and wanted to (some not all)  it would not sit well with the voters of the state and protest on the apposing side would immediately start. And the process would start all over again. <br>  <br>  2) Judicial activism will turn our democratic nation into a nation run by tyrant judges. Interesting thought.<br>  <br>  3) Marriage is NOT about love. Marriages were historically for going up in social status, financial purposes, and a family. While some of this is historically accurate it is still a generalization.  <br>  <br>  4) This the people's government, not the judge's government. These judicial activists will nullify your write to vote! It is our government. Yours and mine as well as theirs. The duty of the court is what they carry out. they are appointed by your commandeering chief and weather or not you agree with their rulings, you are obligated to adhere to them as you are obligated to adhere to your commandeering chief. You are not obligated to agree. <br>  <br>  5) What's next? Legalized polygamy, child-adult unions, human-animal unions, human-plant unions, human-fungi unions, and even human-inanimate object unions. I have no idea why you even bothered to mention this. But I understand the point you are trying to make.<br>  <br>  Marriage was a union that was made up for a man and a woman. This union I think should be protected.  I look at marriage as a club. If you don't meet the requirements then you can't join. Its not discriminatory, its just what the rules are composed of. If the opposition feels the left out then they should form their own independent union for their orientation, not try and revise the union that was made for heterosexuals.<br>  <br>  I understand why some look at this as a issue that has to do with human rights. But I don't see it as that at all. I think there are extremest on both sides of this issue, just like their are on racist issues.<br>  <br>  And if the problem is that civil unions are not providing enough of the rights as marriage does, then the issue of civil union needs to be looked at not marrage.|`|aHLnNrOGaa	It is not okay for the majority (straights) to tell a minority (gays) they to not deserve the same rights.<br>  <br>  And if you want to marry an inanimate object, I wish you the best.

I'm going to marry someone I love, and the tax breaks are a bonus.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a state where a couple love each other first and foremost, and everyone should have the right to marry, if they are an adult and have the ability to know what they are doing.  And gays/lesbian couples don't have the same rights as hetero ones...not sure where you're getting that information from. Those rights come with a signed marriage certificate you can show the various agencies responsible for those benefits.|`|FnCvyXVDaa	They want to be accepted so badly.  No matter what, Prop 8 will be looked at by the homosexual community as bigotry and as a violation of their civil rights even though domestic partnerships allow them the same rights, benefits, etc. as married couples. Actually, yes, legalized polygamy may be next as proponents view it as being a union between consenting adults.|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Civil rights should not have been put on the ballot to begin with.<br>  <br>  Marriage: Over 1,049 federal and state level benefits vs. Civil Unions: Over 300 state level benefits.|`|VjkDIvezaa	1 then it must still be an important thing if it has been up so many times don't you think?<br>  #2 makes no sense<br>  #3 so no one gets married for love? maybe that is why so many straight people get divorces they need the gays to teach them how to be in loving relationships. There is a good enough reason right there.<br>  <br>  #4) If it is a peoples government then why can't these people get their civil right to marry? Amendment 14 look it up.  <br>  <br>  #5 children and animals and objects can't give consent.the gays trying to get married are both adults and can both consent to the marriage .<br>  <br>  and they want the word because some of them are religious and want to be married under god. The others want the word because they don't like being singled out with a title that is viewed as less then marriage is looked at
LqySFES4aa	Thats alright, I dont believe in God. I am sorry a simple minded neanderthal as you needs to believe in some higher power, to help you live a good life. Well try to, but I forget that you can redeem all your sins at the end of the week and do the cycle all over again. Christianity sickens me. It is pathetic faith for the weak souls and minds of this world, to bad there is more people out in the world like you Neal. "Beware a group of stupid people is dangerous." And that is exactly what you are, because you are simply ignorant. I am empathetic about Christianity, I understand it, I grew up with it, I am technically "Christian", but the bible for me is like a fairy-tail written by a senile old man.<br>  <br>  "You wonder how I can be wicked enough to attack the Bible. I will tell you:<br>  <br>  "This book, the Bible, has persecuted, even unto death the wisest and the best. This book stayed and stopped the onward movement of the human race. This book poisoned the fountains of learning and misdirected the energies of man.<br>  <br>  "This book is the enemy of freedom, the support of slavery. This book sowed the seeds of hatred in families and nations, fed the flames of war, and impoverished the world. This book is the breastwork of kings and tyrants - the enslaver of women and children. This book has corrupted parliaments and courts. This book has made colleges and universities the teachers of error and the haters of science. This book has filled Christendom with hateful, cruel, ignorant and warring sects. This book taught men to kill their fellows for religion's sake. This book founded the Inquisition, invented the instruments of torture, built the dungeons in which the good and loving languished, forged the chains that rusted in their flesh, erected the scaffolds whereon they died. This book piled f@ggots about the feet of the just. This book drove reason from the minds of millions and filled the asylums with the insane.<br>  <br>  "This book has caused fathers and mothers to shed the blood of their babes. This book was the auction block on which the slave-mother stood when she was sold from her child. This book filled the sails of the slave-trader and made merchandise of human flesh. This book lighted the fires that burned "witches" and "wizards." This book filled the darkness with ghouls and ghosts and the bodies of men and women with devils. This book polluted the souls of men with the infamous dogma of eternal pain. This book made credulity the greatest of virtues, and investigation the greatest of crimes. This book filled nations with hermits, monks, and nuns - with the pious and the useless. This book placed the ignorant and unclean saint above the philosopher and philanthropist. This book taught man to despise the joys of his life that he might be happier in another - to waste this world for the sake of the next.<br>  <br>  "I attack [the Bible] because it is the enemy of human liberty - the greatest obstruction across the highway of human progress.

There are children and teenagers who come on here looking for the answers to their questions, children who already feel like crap for feeling the way they do because their peers and their parents devalue their existence. Answers is supposed to be a supportive community, where someone can find the answers to their questions, not be put down for being who they are. <br>  <br>  The fact is gay teenagers have the highest rates of suicide among the people on this planet. And why is that? it is because people like you attack them and make them feel like nothing, like they have no right to exist alongside your high and mighty self. The fact of the matter is you are a sinner as well...and you are impure, you are not a priest so you shouldn't be preaching to the congregation, because i can assure you that you haven't read the entire bible. You do not Know all of the stories contained within. Frankly, I know that you are a delusional twit, who gets off rubbing people the wrong way.<br>  <br>  also know this, because of you at most, two teens have committed suicide, and you're probably responsible for it. congratulations, you are a murderer...hooray for the bible...not. <br>  <br>  If there is one thing i can tell you, it is to let people live their lives without your input, the only reason you feel like giving it on here is because you're anonymous, and that makes you feel powerful....but in reality, should you voice that opinion anywhere else on this planet you could very well end up bruised and battered.|`|nIrpDrENaa	I know you're talking about neil but I'm a christian too, does that make me a simple minded neanderthal as well??<br>  <br>  I do not agree with the gay/homo/lesbian (yes I know its the same thing) lifestyle but that doesn't mean I look down on gays/lesbians. <br>  <br>  One of my best friend is a lesbian, and she is the sweetest kindest person I know! She's probably the only person I know that has stayed my friend through all the rumor crap!<br>  <br>  Its insulting to hear you say things like simple minded neanderthal christian...because I am one, and I have nothing against gays/lesbians.

Do you realize that in most of the world women are safe to walk the streets without being veiled.  Men in our society would be guilty of breaking the law for bothering a woman in that fashion.  You act as though an unveiled woman is a naked woman.  Every woman should be treated with respect as though she is every man's wife, mother, sister, aunt, cousin or grandmother.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	If men aren't able to control their  rude bahaviour, perhaps they shouldn't be allowed out on the street.  Why is it that some men blame women for their bad behaviour and lack of moralistic responsibility? It is not women's responsibility to remain hidden, it is men's responsibility to treat women with the respect they deserve.|`|Fyz94ApAaa	Well learn to control yourself....a woman shouldn't have to cover herself to keep men in check.

kKSq5VFKaa	"0% - importance"  Assassination is a planned kill<br>   while - Murder is a premeditated kill|`|EYqTV2EYaa	The person has to be a representative for anything, usually politics, and the killers, 99.9% of the time, had to commit the killing out of disagreement. For example, if someone killed a a government official because they disagreed with his views, it would be assassination. However, if a random person in the neighborhood or his wife were to kill him over personal reasons, it would be just a mere murder, and not assassination. For example, think, if Michelle Obama were to kill Barack because he was, I don't know, cheating, it's just regular murder, you get me? Also, in another example, the person doesn't have to be important as a government official or ruler. For instance, I'm not important, but if I somehow began a movement in my neighborhood, which isn't even publicized, just local, and someone killed me in my neighborhood because they disagreed with my movement, I was assassinated.|`|PevKGmeFaa	well to be assassinated is killed for pay i think. or a specific person hitting a specific target...<br>  <br>  murder is blunt homocide.|`|JhEboCmDaa	Hmm.

"Messianic Jews" are Christians. They are NOT Jewish, they have no right to the label of Jewish and they discredit both Judaism and Christianity.  Twisting Jesus into Jewish holy days and rituals doesn't make someone Jewish.  It does the opposite.  Very few were ever Jewish to start with and claiming a grandparent or great-grandparent who might have been Jewish doesn't make someone Jewish.  You're Jewish if your mother is Jewish or you convert UNLESS you convert to another religion (or was raised Christian).  If you believe in Jesus, you're a Christian.<br>  <br>  The belief in a divine sacrificed/risen savior is a Christian/pagan concept - NOT a Jewish one.

In the same way a Buddhist would admit that they are good or not because of the same reasoning and never because of their own self awareness which can and often does give a false impression.<br>  <br>  Being a good person really means creating positive consequences in as many personal interactions as possible, ideally trying to do this with no selfish intention. The aim is for no consequence at all for ourselves and a positive outcome for the other person but this is not always possible, but the continuous purposeful effort is the key to eventual success. You do not have to be Buddhist to do this.<br>  <br>  Peace from a Buddhist.|`|IbsCUaqVaa	Boy don't make a promise you won't keep<br>  Oh no<br>  Hear me now,<br>  Don't you try to fool around with me<br>  Anymore<br>  Make up your mind<br>  Or just let go<br>  There's something you should know Chorus:<br>  If you really want me<br>  Yeah yeah<br>  If you really need me<br>  Yeah yeah<br>  Let me get it straight and tell you<br>  Make it understand<br>  If you really want me boy<br>  You'd better be good<br>  better be good, better be good <br>  <br>  Jazmin, Better Be Good|`|XHsowAjTaa	depends on what you consider being good

It is only after a child starts to develop mentally enough to choose right from wrong for them selves that they then start needing other saving graces preformed by the person themselves like Repentance,Baptism and partaking of the Sacrament. In the same way animals are saved, they also have not developed or maybe I should say have not been given the light of Christ to choose right from wrong with no training or outside influences. Yet if you search your heart you will find the confirmation that animals are saved into the kingdom of heaven and most will have lived up to their potential of creation.|`|AA10669573	Well, for you I hope you have the opportunity before you take your last breath to rethink your ideas.

Therefore at that point they will be held responsible for their actions and must repent. I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion,  and I am not saying that I am the most upstanding christian, however I think that you should do a little research about Jesus and the Bible, before making a statement like "Stupid Jesus" or "Jesus is pretty lame".

bd1146a8eabf807f844df323db88aad2aa	There are many sins in the bible that Christians choose to ignore in favour of persecuting homosexuals, but the short answer is they like greed and money and they like being bullies.|`|1651d3429e0ccb9917b6cade2f14b42aaa	Even the world like to prioritize!

That argument would probably not take in as many people and would probably turn off a lot as well- it does sound a little odd to say "send money to fight greed", doesn't it? In short, greed is not an issue that can be used to raise money.|`|58f6965a53c947ccce835659f1d0d228aa	Both of these are lusts not sins.

In answer to your non-question, greedy people aren't constantly throwing their greed in our faces and telling us that greed is normal and should be accepted by all.|`|fXKu0kwIaa	Because greed drives people to strive for wealth, and provides a motive to do things in the process of attaining wealth that can help the world and the economy.  You need the people pushing to make the best and fastest computers, the people who want to make the next best cellphone, the people who want to find the next best alternative to gasoline, the people that want to be the one to discover the cure for cancer, even if the motivation for doing so is their own pecuniary gain.  <br>  <br>  Homosexuality scares some of the right wing fundamentalists because it goes against their faith and everything they believe in.  They don't see anything for the world at large to gain by the homosexual sex act (which in their mind is the only difference between a guy having a friend and a guy having a gay lover).|`|TLLklriUaa	Because they like greed and they don't like gays.|`|z9KT3TTUaa	Beats me...

And the next stage will end 5500 years from now in ice in the first stage of the next cycle (again from memory).<br>  <br>  The only coincidence that I see is that the Mayan calendar ends in fire in 2012 and so does the earth in revelations.<br>  <br>  My caveat is that the stages age/form is from memory of what I studied 10 years ago.

N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Technically it is very easy to convert. You just have to say in front of several Islamic witnesses that there is but one God, Allah and Mohamed is his prophet.

The ‚ÄúShahada‚Äù is the first and most important of the five pillars of Islam.<br>  <br>  With the pronunciation of this testimony, or ‚ÄúShahada‚Äù, with sincere belief and conviction, one enters the fold of Islam.<br>  <br>  Upon entering the fold of Islam purely for the Pleasure of God, all of one‚Äôs previous sins are forgiven, and one starts a new life of piety and righteousness. The Prophet said to a person who had placed the condition upon the Prophet in accepting Islam that God would forgive his sins:<br>  <br>  ‚ÄúDo you not know that accepting Islam destroys all sins which come before it?‚Äù (Saheeh Muslim)<br>  <br>  When one accepts Islam, they in essence repent from the ways and beliefs of their previous life. One need not be overburdened by sins committed before their acceptance. The person‚Äôs record is clean, and it is as if he was just born from his mother‚Äôs womb. One should try as much as possible to keep his records clean and strive to do as many good deeds as possible.<br>  <br>  To convert to Islam and become a Muslim a person needs to pronounce the below testimony with conviction and understanding its meaning:<br>  <br>  I testify ‚ÄúLa ilah illa Allah, Muhammad rasoolu Allah.‚Äù<br>  <br>  The translation of which is:<br>  <br>  ‚ÄúI testify that there is no true god (deity) but God (Allah), and that Muhammad is a Messenger (Prophet) of God.‚Äù<br>  <br>  It can be done alone, but it is much better to be done in the mosque, so we may help you in pronouncing it right and to provide you with important resources for new Muslims|`|mC4mnvGFaa	Why would you want to convert to Islam? it is the most repressive society on the planet right now.

Muhammad used the Quran to control his wives during his life (33:30-33) and even after his death (33:53). He told his wives that they will burn in hell if they betray him (66:3-5, 66:10).<br>  Muhammad was incorruptible and his motives were pure - Yes / No<br>  <br>  2) Muhammad was a warlord (Quran, Ch. 8 ‚ÄúSpoils of War‚Äù). He said: Fight the idol-worshipers, capture, besiege and ambush them until they convert to Islam (9:5). Allah will humiliate them and give you victory (9:14). Enjoy the spoils of war (8:69). If you flee from battle you are condemned to hell (8:16). He promised his soldiers spoils of war (48:19-20) if they conquer Khaybar and Makka. After the Jewish tribe Banu Qurayza betrayed Muhammad, he killed some and captured others. His men took their land, houses and wealth (33:26-27). Muhammad gave himself permission to marry women who were captured or made widows by his advancing army (33:50).<br>  Muhammad was a ‚Äúmessenger of peace‚Äù - Yes / No<br>  <br>  3) Apparently, being a prophet of Allah is not fully satisfying. Muhammad‚Äôs life-work was so unfulfilling that he needed more than one wife in order to feel complete. He was on the most important mission in history but he still had so much spare-time that he was able to marry many wives. During his practice of polygamy, Muhammad married his ex-daughter-in-law, his first-cousin, women whom he considered ‚Äúspoils of war‚Äù, women for whom he had payed dowries and any woman who ‚Äúgave herself to the Prophet‚Äù if he desired her (33:37, 33:50). In addition to his wives, Muhammad was allowed to marry slave-women whom his ‚Äúright hand possessed‚Äù (33:52). This is the man who said that we should care about God alone because all of our sexual desires will be fulfilled in the afterlife.<br>  Muhammad, a holy man, ‚Äúneeded‚Äù all those wives - Yes / No<br>  <br>  4) The Quran is full of sexism (4:34, 2:223, 2:282, 12:28) and it allows men to use emotional and physical punishment to discipline their disobedient wives (4:34).<br>  As the Quran says, men are ‚Äúa degree above‚Äù women (2:228) - Yes / No<br>  <br>  5) The Quran claims that, except for a few, all Jews are treacherous (5:13) and ‚Äúlisteners of falsehood‚Äù who are ‚Äúgreedy for illicit gain‚Äù (5:42). The worst enemies of the believers are the Jews and the idol-worshipers (5:82). Jews and Christians are only friends to each other (5:51).<br>  Allah needs to use stereotypes in order to simplify a complex world - Yes / No<br>       <br>  6) Allah takes credit for ‚Äúnatural‚Äù events such as lightning (13:13) flight (16:79) shooting stars (67:5) and earthquakes (16:15). The Quran says that the night sky is used to ‚Äúveil‚Äù daytime (7:54) and that sperm comes from between the backbone and ribs (86:7).<br>  The Quran is a modern, scientific book - Yes / No<br>  <br>  7) Allah could have banned slavery outright in the Quran, but left the issue up to Muslims to interpret as they saw fit. The result? Muslims practiced slavery (30:28), as well as sexual-slavery (23:6, 70:30), victimizing tens of millions of people, for over a thousand years. Muslims made it easy to find non-believers to enslave. They designated areas in Africa in which they would not preach Islam - so that slaves captured there would not turn out to be fellow Muslims. The Muslim‚Äôs most holy country, Saudi Arabia, did not ban slavery until 1962.<br>  God would allow his believers to own slaves - Yes / No<br>  <br>  End of Test.<br>  <br>  If you marked ‚ÄúNo‚Äù for ANY of the preceding questions, Islam is NOT right for you.|`|2zYCQX9saa	Turn in her orange robe for a back back bomb and say 'Habibi' three times real fast!|`|LRjaS17taa	before converting to Islam, it's better for you to learn about your religion, then, learn more about islam from the original sources (Holy Qur'an and Hadits), If u already know the purpose of ur conversion, u may go to islamic centre at ur city.<br>  Actually, no exact procedure, only say syas shahadah (2 statements): that Allah is the only god and Muhammad is his messenger. that's all.<br>  <br>  Dont worry abt living as a muslim woman in europe and US.

That an all-powerful being has a special plan made just for them, and designed them to be perfect.<br>  <br>  Evolution proves they're not special. The universe doesn't revolve around them.

Evolution is a theory in crisis in light of the tremendous advances we've made in molecular biology, biochemistry and genetics over the past fifty years. We now know that there are in fact tens of thousands of irreducibly complex systems on the cellular level. Specified complexity pervades the microscopic biological worrld. "Although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small, weighing less than 10-12 grams, each is a micro-miniaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery, made up af one hundred thousand million atoms,  which is far more complicated than any machinery built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non-living world.And we don't need a microscope to observe irreducible complexity.

If the situation is out of control and you don't know how to deal with it.. then it's the job of the manager to intervene.. he has to be told.. if it's a matter of something small.. then ask a colleague, who might be able to help out.. If it's a bigger issue, it should always be the manager.. in little matters, colleagues should be able to sort them out amongst themselves.. if someone has a complaint to make about a product.. then in that case send them to customer services.. that is their department...a big store has several managers..  junior managers.. the top manager only in the most extreme cases.. all big stores have several at least 2 junior managers, if there is anything that cannot be handled by asking another member of staff for advice or by customer service.. who are in charge to deal with complaints.. or if they want to return goods.. then it would be one of the managers... one is usually somewhere in the store..or warehouse'' (if there are spillages or the toilets not clean.. a staff member of customer services usually calls via loudspeaker ''for the in store cleaner to deal with that''.

HMteUyRdaa	Hi, my brother married a girl not of the Catholic faith and it wasn't a problem. You need permission from the Bishop of the Diocese but as long as you agree to raise the children in the Catholic faith there should be no issue at all. Talk to the Priest who is going to be the officiant, he will tell you how to go about it. Catholics are accepting of all faiths because if you look at history we have learned it is the only way to coexist. So don't worry it will all work out.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your up coming nuptials! I will keep you both in my prayers.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Kate|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	it may be challenging due to the fact you are not in a "God" faith - Christian. Jewish - that type faith.  your BF must have thought about this a lot of this already otherwise he's not have asked you to marry him.  apparently you have an odd view of the Catholic church so you may want to make sure it's something to which you want to commit. if the priest deems you two suitable and you go through the counseling, you will have to agree to raise your children Catholic - NO wiccan.  i'm not sure what you're worried about with the "7 Sacraments"  - i really can't fathom what would worry you about becoming a priest  ; )      i'm surprised you are agreeing to this as it's sooooooo different and away from that which you believe.  i don't say this with malice as a good friend is a wiccan and we have had some knock down drag out "debates".|`|AA11796124	If you are that troubled by Catholicism, perhaps you should rethink your desire to marry a Catholic?|`|yAvTxh47aa	Not really, no.<br>  <br>  To be married in the Catholic church requires more than just a ceremony. Unless you intend to lie to the priest (which would make you a crappy Wiccan) then the priest has every right to deny you their religious ceremony in their religious building by their religious clergy.<br>  <br>  Here, read this catholic wedding information:<br>  <a href="http://catholicweddinghelp.com/questions/rules-requirements.htm" rel="nofollow">http://catholicweddinghelp.com/questions...</a>|`|GC9g3Nrmaa	YES!!

In this day and age, however, it is becoming more and more common for Catholics to marry out of their faith. As we are a universal people, we are always happy to have new perspectives brought into our community.<br>  <br>  You will be asked to attend a series of classes and retreats in which you and your BF will learn what the Church expects out of a married couple, and as you are not Catholic, what you can expect out of the Church. Their are some strict rules of course: you would be asked to raise the children Catholic, for example, and to participate as far as you are allowed in the life of the Church.<br>  <br>  I know that this may seem a bit harsh, but you ARE asking a Catholic Priest to perform a Catholic ceremony in which you will be married. The Church has the right to expect certain behaviors and actions from those who she makes available to herself.|`|AA12136918	I am  sure  if you told  the priest you are wiccan he would  not agree you would  have to accept  Catholicism  but Of you say  nothing you can  probably get away  with it  although it would  be wrong  you would  be promising to bring any children up catholic,|`|v61VWKMDaa	Of course.<br>  <br>  I've never seen a Catholic up in arms about Harry Potter, that's usually the Evangelicals and fundies of all kinds.|`|sauHi3vEaa	I don't see the problem here.

vOwfC1SJaa	Insurance rate records go back pretty far. In fact I see the insurance rates for women going above mens in 20 or 30 years. Remember even in todays times there are more males drivers than female drivers, therefor that means that more males will be in accidents than females. When this number evens out, as the number of women drivers increases, the insurance rates will change. Women percentage wise in comparison to men drivers actually get in more accidents, especially in the small bumper to bumper ones. <br>  <br>  You are right tho, insurance discrimination should not be based on sex, but rather an individuals bad driving record.|`|7uffHRdkaa	It's a good question. There's a lot of different ways to answer it based on how you interpret it though. In terms of males, I think another reason why they may make insurance rates higher is because of the stereotypical, and somewhat true theory, that men drive the car when family's go out. So you could say they're driving more. In Florida, car insurance rates tend to be high, because old people get in accidents, sometimes because they drive slow. Should everyone else suffer though? Not really, but the way how it works is you're rates go up even if you get hit. So it's like a protection.<br>  <br>  It's all about how a culture views something. Being ''male'' or ''female'' is explicit. It's a fact. It's biological. It can be proven through science. However, there's no such thing as being ''black.'' It's a social creation that came out of slavery and colonialism. It doesn't mean everyone interprets it similarly though. How do you prove if someone is ''black'' though? Everyone's idea of ''black'' varies. Would people believe in the mysterious ''one-drop policy?'' How do people know when someone has ''one drop?'' Would this exclude Latin Americans of African ancestry? There'd be too many flaws in basing a tax on something without evidence. It doesn't mean people haven't done it before though. In the South, prior to the Civil Rights act, there were things like the grandfather clause, literary tests and poll taxes. What was there theory based on? With the grandfather clause, it was on if your grandfather was a slave, which was documented. I guess with the poll tax, they judged by how someone looked when coming to the booth.<br>  <br>  When it comes to business, people will always try to play the deck to their hand, even if it means deceiving the system, while trying to remain within the lines. When you're basing a statistic on something though, you need to ask a couple questions. One, who did the research? And did they manipulate it? In other words, are they telling the whole story? For example, although black's proportionally are the most likely to receive welfare, it's a fact that white's collect welfare the most out of anyone in the U.S. Another thing you'd have to ask is, based on the fact that black's are statistically most likely to commit crime (or theft), why would this be the case? It's not because the thieves are black. It's because they're poor and tied into a pattern that involves crime that there parents and grandparents have been in too. It wouldn't be a fair generalization to say black's are statistically most common to commit crime, while realizing that most black Americans don't have criminal records. Unless your convenience store is specifically designed for ex-prisoner's, I don't think you can say that black's who walk through the door of your store are criminals.<br>  <br>  I'll try to make this as least confusing as I can, but if you read it carefully, you'll understand what I mean:<br>  <br>  Let's say A equals African-American's commit crimes at higher rates.<br>  <br>  Let's say B equals Poor people commit crimes at higher rates.<br>  <br>  A to B doesn't always equal B to A. But A needs B in order to do the crime.<br>  <br>  Saying A would equal B would mean African-American's equal criminals. This is an incorrect generalization.<br>  <br>  Saying B equals a higher chance to be commit crimes is a correct generalization.<br>  <br>  B always will supersede A, no matter whether A is black, white, Asian or whatever.<br>  <br>  Now would it be more appropriate to assume poor people are going to commit crime more? Yes, but it doesn't necessarily mean all poor people do this. But it means the level of desperation is likely higher. The next problem is how do you know who's poor? Sometimes it's a giveaway (ex. homeless), but usually, it's not. There are ways to know though. For example, if an AA comes into your store saying the N word and has his shorts below his waist, it's probably fair to assume he's poor and uneducated. If he were educated, he'd probably be smart enough to realize no one likes being mooned.Basically, the problem is, the structuring of the generalization, as well as societal acceptances. A few months ago, I was on I 95 going down to Florida. I stop at a gas station like a mile into some rural town. The GM or owner of the gas station was a like 50 year old black guy. He had confederate stuff for sale all over his gas station. There was a shot glass that said ''God created the south on the 8th day.'' I knew for a fact that Exxon wasn't recommending this. So out of curiosity, I asked him, in as polite of a way as I could, why are you selling this? He said because it sells. When it comes to insurance companies, they'll do what they can. If it were legal to tax blacks more, and people didn't bash them for it, they probably would. It's all about money in business in America. Not morale. If that's not evidence, I don't know what is.

You should really judge people individually. Since you're about to get married I would assume you've known him for a long time. If you do then you should know who he is whether he's a nice guy or a rude guy. If you accept the engagement ring that means you really like him.

People who try to straddle the line are fooling themselves (though I am thankful they exist, since it's better than having more fundies).<br>  <br>  P.S. I'm sick of people using that Albert Einstein quote. He didn't have any more proof of his religion than anyone else.

Refer to the Einstein quote at the top.|`|cCd8L2PGaa	Well, I think they both like fuxking each other, so maybe.|`|AA11104965	There is a principle known as Occam's Razor which is the foundation for all human knowledge. It says that whenever two hypotheses equally explain a phenomenon, the simpler one is more likely to be correct.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you have God. God is defined to be infinitely powerful and infinitely intelligent. In other words, he is infinitely complex, and therefore can never be the simplest explanation for anything.<br>  <br>  Without Occam's Razor, science is impossible.<br>  With Occam's Razor, belief in God is impossible.<br>  <br>  This proves that science and religion are actually diametrically opposed to each other. They are inherently incompatible. The only way people can believe in both is through inconsistent and irrational thinking.|`|GItBUBL9aa	In my opinion they are.  I even believe science can be used to corroborate scripture.<br>  <br>  Many Christians like myself have no problem with a big bang, or God working in an evolutionary process. Day is used figuratively for a period of time in many scriptures, and the day/age theory of the creation believes there can be millions to billions of years between the days.<br>  <br>  The order for the creation parallels the same order science gives. First comes the heavens (stars, etc.), then an empty earth without form, then land followed by oceans, then plant life followed by the first intelligent life in the sea, then comes birds (which according to science are descendants of dinosaurs), then mammals, then a more specific wild animal, and finally man. It's actually amazing that it gives an order 3,000 plus years before science confirms that same order.<br>  <br>  Adam is not created until after the seventh day, and the day/age theory believes the man created on the sixth day is not the same as Adam who is first mentioned after the seventh day. That allows for cave men, and explains where Adam and Eve's children found wives, since there were people before them.<br>  <br>  As far as intellegent design, when some Christians latch onto a world that is 6,000 years old, the thought of "not intelligent" comes to my mind. They need to be convinced that science is not the enemy, that science actually corroborates the biblical order. Likewise, non-religionists need to explain how Genesis came up with the same order as science, considering how that might relate to intelligent design.|`|WWT45CEzaa	yes|`|AA10858522	No all the religions only accept proof that affirms there beliefs and dismiss things proven to be false. Religion is based on old superstition and storytelling. Any part of religion proven to be false makes the whole thing fall down since it is supposed to be perfect. Semitic religions are ethnic group based meaning that one race is better than all others in the eyes of god.There used to be many in the bible (Genesis 11:And the Lord said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do; and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.<br>   7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.)Who is the US he is talking to?But somehow it ends up the god of the jews is the only god. However just because he is the god of the Jews means he is not the god of anyone else. That sucks!|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Some of the most outstanding scientists of our time are committed believers, and this has been true over the centuries. In fact, some say their Christian faith has made them better scientists, because they believed God has called them to explore His creation.<br>  <br>  The real question is this: Is there a conflict between what the Bible teaches and what science says? The answer is no‚Äînot when we understand them properly. Many years ago, I heard someone use a phrase that might help you: "All truth is God's truth." In other words, the truth God teaches us through His Word will never contradict the truth He teaches us through His world.<br>  <br>  Never forget: God created everything that exists, including the laws that rule the universe. The Bible says, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. ... God saw all that he had made, and it was very good" (Genesis 1:1, 31). If you become involved in medical research someday, you will only be uncovering what God has already done.<br>  <br>  Commit your life into Christ's hands‚Äîincluding your future. God made you, and He has a plan for your life, including your career. Don't be satisfied with anything less than His will. And if He does lead you into medical research, be grateful for the opportunities He will give you to make this world a better place.|`|CXAKpeH3aa	no. Religion is based on some proof but more on faith. while science is something that can be recorded, analyzed, repeated, recorded, and proven. like the birth of Jesus. Mary was a virgin. scientifically, it's not possible for a virgin to give birth. that is a miraculous thing done by the power of God. you can't repeat that action, analyze that action using material things. we believe that God allowed Mary to give birth to Jesus.|`|iaPtohhhaa	No. When science ask for the proof of God, what are we lookng for?

And I understand that many of us hearing have no clue about the deaf culture or deafness . . . but wow, the questions I was asked, that, even as a hearing person . . . were so stupid.<br>  <br>  Let me begin with the driving issue.<br>  Yes, deaf people have Driver's License and do drive, regularly. No, they do NOT have handicapped license plates (that is for the physically disabled) . . . they are not BLIND, thus, yes, they can drive a motor vehicle . . . no, they do NOT hear sirens . . . this is why they have flashing lights.<br>  <br>  Most of us actually drive deaf, anyway ... Honestly, how many of us blast our car stereo's we can barely hear an ambulance or siren, anyway? Most of us . . . <br>  <br>  This is also why the word AMBULANCE is written backwards on the truck . . . so deaf people and just plain lazy hearing people can look in the rearview mirror and see it!<br>  <br>  So, my point . . . the most stupid questions I got:<br>  <br>  1) Oh, your boyfriend can't talk?!!!<br>  <br>  . . . WRONG! He can talk, they do teach deaf people to speak out loud and American Sign Language, too . . . he cannot HEAR.<br>  <br>  >>And many times, these people and others would talk LOUDER to him.

I don't really have to work at it, I am set in my ways, and that was the hard part...staying consistent is not my cup of tea. I like green tea though. <br>  Changing the flow of life is where you find the nuggets that make life worth living.|`|bc087fc5c848c231a493eee2e0caecf8aa	no.i was labelled that as a child,and it irked me.as it turned out,my perceived "eccentricity" was actually a very high i.q. the people around me growing up,thought my ideas odd.at the science museum where i work,everyone understands my ideas and appreciates me. being called eccentric was a nightmare of social alienation for me,i would never want to go back to my earliest youth.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Some 'eccentrics' probably enjoy the attention, as many outsiders associate eccentricity with intelligence, sadly.|`|Uh2x306Caa	I have OCD I admit it and peeps have told me I'm quite eccentric but I think we can all be when we want to be and that's the truth.|`|DqUf3LM8aa	yes, and I'm not a senior citizen.  Just over 30.  I don't work at it, it just comes naturally.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	I have always been odd, young people may find me eccentric but I don't think I am, but that is just my opinion.

I love embarrassing my children who are 14, 11 and 9 and I wish they would be here to tell you(To tell the truth I believe they like it, they just pretend to be annoyed but they smile and don't want me to change).  I hate style.  I don't want to be a robot.|`|o6MQWMo5aa	Yes, I am the benign old soul who knows about animals and nature.

I love it. It makes up for years of being the token white face at the party!!!|`|wx4zRwjxaa	If you know that you are eccentric  then you are truly not. Eccentricity is something that you are without having to cultivate it or be aware of.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	I used to be classed as a " Class Clown" and now just an old fool, but it is all in good fun.<br>  <br>  My kids have sometimes lovingly referred to me as "weird".|`|hallarIxaa	If I were rich they would call me eccentric since I'm not the just call me crazy.|`|z8jYprWkaa	I am not classed as such - just as being 'perfick' !|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Sure, why not?

6x99ue8maa	god knows<br>  <br>  being a teen is hard|`|EnfChrwXaa	See, my problem with this question is that I don't know what's typical of my age group.  I'll be 60 next year; my friends range from 30 to 80 and they're all so varied that it's difficult to pin down.  I know people much younger than I am, who do absolutely nothing except cook, clean, read, go to bingo and such-like, and who have no opinions of their own - they're really old!  But then I know much older people who go snow-boarding, rock-climbing, cycling, take an active interest in just about everything.  I would say I'm a fairly average person; I try to keep up with current affairs & politics, like socialising, run my own business, and try to keep fit and active (even though I hate exercise!) Whether that's typical of my age group or not is unknown.|`|z8jYprWkaa	Can't WAIT to become an old grumpy !|`|khJBfboRaa	No, I am not typical of my age group.  I love singing, I love modern music and I like fashion.  I am young at heart.  My parents were the same.  My mother loved Jarvis Cocker until the end of her life and my dad was a Rolling Stones fan.  I love the Killers, Coldplay, Arctic Monkeys, Duffy and Adele, amongst many modern singers and musicians.|`|W5G9LLenaa	no everyone around me are so old. all i want to do is party and run around|`|car4UyLFaa	Oh, this is a senior citizen question. . . well.<br>  <br>  When I'm well-aged, I expect that I will be atypical in some ways and typical in others, depending on the stereotypes. People will probably mostly think I'm off my rocker, but I'll just be having fun. I can guarantee that I will still be listening to new music and keeping up on current films, but I'll also fit well into the common eccentricities old men are prone to. . . oh, and grampa hats!|`|Hc2XlRO4aa	I am told that  i am a pest/nuisance at my age, but i cannot help it no one ever does anything right in my eyes, if i don't do it myself its not done. Everyone around me is selfish wants everything done on a silver platter while they sit around like Norm :).<br>  to answer the question i consider myself a perfectionist to a point everyone does what they want and i stress too much for people that don't give a darn.<br>  Im stressed can u tell :))|`|8cTkYTQXaa	I have never been typical. I am 52 and have never been married and have no children. I am going to school and found that I have a knack for chemistry. I was always looked at as strange, but I am really outside looking in. What people think about me is not a concern of mine. I just go where I find things interesting. I have been a musician, artist, laborer, and when I took those things as far as I could, I did something else that was interesting to me.|`|Uh2x306Caa	I'm nearly 31 yrs of age and I don't have any children yet but I consider myself mostly mature.  Of course there are times when I have a good giggle and act immature but I think most of us can be like that.  It's human nature.<br>  But as far as being mature I hold down a full-time job and I function to the best of my ability.|`|AA11229554	I have never been typical, I like disco, bluegrass, and classical music, and think I am 18, but I'm 68|`|v0FgA15Gaa	Hopefully not!<br>  <br>  I don't party or anything so strenuous anymore but neither do I play bingo.

That's life!|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I am more typical than I care to be of my age group.|`|YCB0AjFiaa	no im a very immature 24 haha|`|nCkPhvf5aa	I'm very different, but in the kind of way that makes people not like you because they don't get you at all. <br>  <br>  Everyone my age likes movies like Superbad and Forgetting Sarah Marshall. They think they're individual because they are liberal, smoke marijuana, do other drugs, are somewhat informed about politics, and think women's rights means the right to wear a miniskirt and consume- yet they see nothing cliche about what they are doing. <br>  <br>  It's like: How about instead of trying to prove to everyone else that you have more on the inside than they thought in highschool when you got drunk and threw up at prom- no now you are the new stereotype for your age. Congratulations on not thinking for yourself!<br>  <br>  For the record I am a democrat, but I don't shove it down people's throats and I don't bring it up randomly just to sound "informed" and to give myself an artificial ego boost. I'm just saying I'm surrounded by these people, and it's like swimming in urine.|`|AA11068745	No.I am 70 and own an xbox360 and each time I finish a game I cant wait to get another.My wife who is 60 likes to sit and watch me play and has her DS to hand so that she can do her own stuff.My favourite game has to be Far Cry 2 and I am awaiting the release of Halo Wars,Gears of war 2.out later this year.We do photography which can be seen on flicr,walk and enjoy things in general.We are buying a caravan and going travelling next week.|`|nM4lFT0iaa	I don't think so, many my age are either married, or separated, or has a kid.<br>  <br>  Plus, unlike most of my age who are fond of going out all the time, drinking, trying to get laid, I love staying at home, cooking, and being just a homebody.|`|U6FFI7jcaa	typical of my age not really most people my age or so i think go out party am 21 and i dont party drank or anything am a mom and i am devoted to my son|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Not hardly.  I'm 48 and have no kids or immediate prospects for any.|`|UllYFJgjaa	That's a good question. I am 54 years old and I am not typical at my age group. Never married, no children, still collect fun "kid" stuff like Teddy Bears and enjoy MOST every kind of music (some limits of course), still like Disney movies.|`|xyt9NdjVaa	No, not with having gone through my accident and two hip replacements in my early 50s. This is so much unlike me. Just 5 yrs ago, I was physically active, vibrant, always on the go, and was dancing my way through life, feeling much younger than my age. A person should enjoy everyday to it's fullest since you never know what may happen at any given moment to change your life forever.|`|slHUNl58aa	No, I am just an atypical sort. I always have been a bit different. Still having fun in my late 40'S<br>  Odd humor, laid back, don't much care what people think of me. I like me just fine when I look in the mirror because I have the peace of knowing that I have done my best to live in peace with all.|`|2JvM6hucaa	Well, in some respects yes and in others no.  I've been asked if I would consider going back to teaching (part time) after a presentation I made for a class at our community college.  All my friends are asking me if I'm nuts to even consider it.  They think I should just do the things retirees should do.  But, I'm just too young for that!|`|b3h0ovgRaa	No and yes.  Poppy|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Not sure about typical but in my youth, I took most the same paths as my contemporaries. Had a very different  career than anyone ever thought I'd have considering some foolishness in my youth.<br>  <br>  Fairly typical for that time. Dated my wife since she was 14-15, married her when I was 21 and she was 19, both worked had 2 kids 9 years apart and just getting the youngest out of college.Son is on his own and has been for some years.I'm still married to the same woman. I retired from Police work and  have another job as does my wife. <br>  <br>  I don't know if any of that is typical anymore or not.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Typical for my age?  Like I said on a previous question, I'm 47.  I wear Winnie-The-Pooh pyjamas, nightgowns, and everything I wear to sleep.  When it's just my family at home, I live in Canada and it's cold so I wear long johns and thermal tops and walk around the house like that, it's comfy.  My three children age 14, 11 and 9 had a special meeting and determined I was acting like a three year old kid.  Life is too short to be preoccupied with style in your own house and I love to wear things other people don't wear.  I can honestly say that I have never been typical of anything.  The older I get, the more eccentric I become.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	No...I guess I am not typical of my age group...as a younger girl,  I Was more, inquisitive...crazy, adventurous than others. As a woman now, I continually seek others wisdom. So typically My view of women of my age group may differ from others...but I do not fit the Play group Mom mold...I would say not...I feel I have walked a different road than allot of the women around my area, so I cannot relate, that is one of the reasons I am here...I do relate to strong women...Just need to find a niche|`|ku2tP4eEaa	Certainly not typical for a 60 year old male.  I am in better shape physically and mentally than many of my ages peers.|`|fd7f7760fab598ddb7f5fd26f811c2baaa	No, I don't think so I have several friends who are younger than me by years, yet I'm the one who is thought to be the youngest. I guess I am just a natural child at times. I'm just me :)|`|fyrj50Braa	I am certainly not a typical of my age as i am often told.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	No, I am not typical of my age group.

I give advice for a living.  I am a community worker with older people.  I am well qualified to carry out this work. I am not sure I see myself as others see me.  I think I underestimate my own value.  Maybe that is because I am modest?|`|4SF4KGu4aa	Yes. Because I wouldn't take advice from me even if I was to ask me.<br>  <br>  Yes. The asker is generally more qualified than I am to give advice.<br>  <br>  No. I don't think I want to know how others see me.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	I have some wisdom, and I hope it helps others through their difficulties and worries.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	Never.<br>  <br>  No, not at all.<br>  <br>  No, I am sure I don't.|`|ejuJiZAAaa	NO<br>  NO <br>  NO<br>  i feel weird now<br>  make me a sandwich|`|g25k21fAaa	Definitely! Especially when someone like me has led a sheltered lifestyle and tend to get everything wrong and upside down.<br>  <br>  Yep... especially if it's not in my usual area of expertise... not that I actually have any areas of expertise anyway.<br>  <br>  Nope. I can't see myself as others see me, cos I can't get away from me to see me do stuff from a distance. Sometimes, I might catch a glimpse of me from another point of view, but it's only a flash.|`|v0FgA15Gaa	I think I have wisdom but now that you've asked I have realised that nobody asks me for advice!

This is because people are generally stupid when it comes to such things and presume that those they ask are worth asking. Which is usually a huge mistake.<br>  <br>  No. because I don't care about my qualifications. If somebody asks and I'm in the mood I might answer. But I just don't care if my answer at that particular moment is correct, or reasonable, or rational, or even helpful. Caveat emptor, an' all that. I'm the bloke who would shrug if somebody asked whether or not they should jump and tell them yes.

Its the only thing on this list I still do and enjoy - perhaps I should indulge my inner child and try the other things again some time soon!|`|fyrj50Braa	Yep climb a tree i used to love climbing to the top of one and just sit and watch the world go by.

I remember as I swung out over the drop...I though " Jeeeze if this rope breaks, so do I" lol.<br>  The dogs were leaping about barking like crazy, they must have thought I'd gone mad.........But it was good fun, that was last summer.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	I indulge in my inner child whenever my wife isn't looking.

I'm grown up now, but I have to admit, yes, I still do that... though the last time was more than a month ago. I have to make sure no one else is at home before I go clamboring all over the furniture make believing and talking aloud (as you do when pretending there's someone there with you). Sigh.

These are the things I learned:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Share everything. <br>  <br>  Play fair. <br>  <br>  Don't hit people. <br>  <br>  Put things back where you found them. <br>  <br>  Clean up your own mess. <br>  <br>  Don't take things that aren't yours. <br>  <br>  Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody. <br>  <br>  Wash your hands before you eat. <br>  <br>  Flush. <br>  <br>  Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you. <br>  <br>  Live a balanced life - learn some and think some<br>  and draw and paint and sing and dance and play <br>  and work every day some. <br>  <br>  Take a nap every afternoon. <br>  <br>  When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, <br>  hold hands, and stick together. <br>  <br>  Be aware of wonder.<br>  Remember the little seed in the styrofoam cup: <br>  The roots go down and the plant goes up and nobody <br>  really knows how or why, but we are all like that. <br>  <br>  Goldfish and hamsters and white mice and even <br>  the little seed in the Styrofoam cup - they all die. <br>  So do we. <br>  <br>  And then remember the Dick-and-Jane books <br>  and the first word you learned - the biggest<br>  word of all - LOOK. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Everything you need to know is in there somewhere. <br>  The Golden Rule and love and basic sanitation.<br>  Ecology and politics and equality and sane living. <br>  <br>  Take any of those items and extrapolate it into <br>  sophisticated adult terms and apply it to your <br>  family life or your work or your government or<br>  your world and it holds true and clear and firm. <br>  Think what a better world it would be if <br>  all - the whole world - had cookies and milk about <br>  three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down with<br>  our blankies for a nap. Or if all governments <br>  had a basic policy to always put thing back where <br>  they found them and to clean up their own mess. <br>  <br>  And it is still true, no matter how old you<br>  are - when you go out into the world, it is best <br>  to hold hands and stick together.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ?

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Inasmuch as vampires are solely mythological creatures with no true basis in factual history, the wooden stake, preferably of ash or yew, will do one of two things when hammered through the heart of a vampire - one, it will destroy the vampire due to the idea that wood, an organic material, disrupts the magical "Pattern" keeping the vampire's spirit bound to his corpse, or two, it will hold him powerless, immobile, and in a state similiar to suspended animation while the vampire hunter completes the job with decapitation, blessing of the corpse, and a complete incineration. Now according to "Dracula" by Stoker, the heart is the mystical repository for the vampire's soul, and can be destroyed by any means that deal catastrophic damage - case in point Quincy runs Dracula through with a bowie knife - and Quincy's version was a big weapon more comparable in size to the famed Arkansas Toothpick. Any damage less than catastrophic will simply be "healed" by the vampire, which is why normal weapons don't hurt them long. The "Pattern" of a vampire could be compared to a saved jpg file on your computer - you can send it over to photoshop and bend it, twist it, etc. do anything you want with it, but unless you save it it reverts to its original image when you leave it. Their "pattern" simply reforms their physical shell back to the point when they were "turned" - this is why vampires don't age and always look exactly as they did the exact moment they died. Even if they cut their hair or get a tattoo their Pattern reweaves to its original form and undoes any changes. Many varieties of wood enjoy mystical qualities in ancient myth, especially ash, holly, oak, elder, mistletoe, and yew - in Norse myth the mistletoe bush provided the dart which felled the god Baldur, and the gods fashioned the first man and woman from the oak and ash trees. Wood is a living, growing material, the exact opposite of cold, dead flesh, and is used in myth to contain great magicks, being employed as wizard's wands and staves.<br>  <br>  Silver is generally not the bane of vampires, but is deadly to werewolves because of the mystical connection both werewolf and silver have with the moon. As gold and other "warm" hued metals have a "sun" affinity, silver is aligned with the Moon.<br>  <br>  Garlic is the least mythologically understood weapon vs. vampires, but the theories abound on why it should work, ranging from pagan mysticisms of ancient mythologies to the more prosaic ideas that the strong smell repels them due to the idea that their digestive systems can no longer handle food or that they somehow suffer an allergy to it, either originating in physical science or invoked upon them as an inherent weakness from their ancient curse.|`|QryYwqmOaa	vampires are monsters and as such they are hunted down and killed, a wooden stake only works if you stick it in the black heart of the vampire (this won't kill the vampire but it will put him to sleep until a fool stumbles upon the creature and pulls out the stake then the vampire will revive), the best way to kill a vampire is to cut his head clean off the shoulders...vampire hate is old, they are regarded as creatures from hell|`|UpK3boARaa	wow i think it was just a way they used to scare ppl so they could control they better, using random things would make the creature seem more real.|`|WNL7Uv0faa	Probably Because Of Dracula, Lol.|`|e5f418fc7559cd92b76db80a71a5a951aa	I wonder if the wooden stake legend has anything to do with Vlad the Impaler?<br>  <br>  It might be worth looking into.|`|9QTO94l2aa	Garlic: Previously Stated<br>  <br>  Silver: The silver you mentioned was usually in the form of silver crosses which has to do with the church and ancient myths combining. Most of our views of Werewolves, Vampires, etc. stem from Bram Stoker's Dracula and Dracula gained his powers supposedly through a pact with the devil. Cross + Demonic Anything = Usually Dead.<br>  <br>  Wooden Stake: This one was harder to find anything solid about. One of the theories is that Wood came from a Tree and the wooden stake is supposed to be able to take the life from the Vampire. That one is a bit.. iffy. (With this I'm not sure, the previously claim of what doesn't die when stabbed with a stake in the heart is pretty dead on as well.)|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Garlic grows from the ground (as far as I know it, I'm not a botanist)<br>  Silver is a naturally occuring element of nature<br>  Wooden stakes are just sharp sticks carved from wood.<br>  <br>  Edit: Right, that's what you were asking. For the most part, these are just elaborate stories. However, they have a certain degree of truth.<br>  Look up "porphyria" on wikipedia.<br>  <br>  "Porphyria has been suggested as an explanation for the origin of vampire and werewolf legends, based upon certain similarities between the condition and the folklore."<br>  "Porphyrics have to be careful about foods high in sulphur. Garlic has a high sulphur content and thus is a food that porphyrics must avoid."<br>  <br>  As for the wooden stake, is there anything that doesn't die when you put a stake through it's heart?

Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus‚Äô body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in ‚Äúremembrance‚Äù as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‚Äò Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>   Now is your chance to come home to Jesus‚Äô one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is ‚Äúthe Holy One of God‚Äù and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.
AA10024451	As a Christian, I recognize from the Bible that not all Christians will be going to heaven. Just a small number of them will. I know that I have the hope of being among the much larger group that will live here on the earth forever, helping to transform it back into the global paradise it was meant to be. In so doing, I will also enjoy perfect health and no doubt part of my time will be spent in traveling the earth, getting to see parts of it I either can't afford to go to now or won't go to without fear of being attacked or killed because of my skin tone or country of origin.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	I think it's the least that we could do to even seem to be as you call "brown nosing", considering the fact that we are given eternal life doing something as easy and as wonderful as accepting Jesus into our life as our personal Lord and Savior. It's not just for God that we do this, God had us also do this for our own benefit to keep us from Hell fire in eternity. People in the world brown nose their bosses, but have they ever saved anyone from burning in the lake of fire? Jesus wants to change our lives, and we were given the free will, because God's love is so great, to simply accept this offer. And if you would like to take this step and follow him yourself, and live a life full of Gods grace, and believe me, he will bless you. Then accept him into your heart. Jesus says: Whoever has an ear, let him listen. He also says Come to me all who are weary, and I shall give you rest.|`|VFmmVHGVaa	By the looks of it,you will never know,I will find out when I get there.<br>  t|`|uFAoq4idaa	No one will be getting any older in heaven.

I'd have to ask, do you know what is to come for those who go to hell?... it seems to me you might be asking the wrong question?<br>  <br>  Simple research can be done to find your answer?

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation‚ÄîJesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

7qe7EUahaa	I will skip a bit and say that I feel Muslims are "mixed-gender relationship" deprived. Since there is no or little relationships between the genders before marriage, or for that matter after marriage, there is some deprivation of what I consider normal and natural relationships.<br>  <br>  Now, there are needful platonic relationships, and friendships both in personal and business life that I think are nonexistent in the Muslim life. <br>  <br>  I also think that a lack of contact with the other gender does create...a desire, a natural desire to "know" or experience. One may fight it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. On the other hand, those that have no "experience" have nothing to miss, or feel deprived of. They do not know, yet, that doesn't mean it doesn't exist; unless they uninterested in normal relationships. (For whatever reason)<br>  <br>  It is in my opinion, a social and emotional sacrifice not to have cross gender friendships and interactions.

We believe that He created us into tribes, nations, and races to appreciate and love one another. One should see His Mercy enveloped in what seems divisive and different. <br>  <br>  <br>  We believe that since God is near to us in our hearts, in our intellect, and in our souls, we can go directly to Him and not go elsewhere or thru anyone.

( I'm a Christian )<br>  <br>  All the matters happens between Christian and Muslim is their belief. In my opinion, they believe in one God who created the universe, we can see that Christian and Muslim teach nearly the same thing (there is only one God, fasting,etc.). Allah means God in Arabic.<br>  <br>  Why they always arguing between themselves? <br>  It is because their point of view about God's figure and a prophet.<br>  <br>  Muslim's opinion about God and Jesus:<br>  Christian believe that Jesus is a great prophet and God who comes down from heaven.Muslim recognizes Jesus, Son of God, as a prophet only, not a God. * this part may be wrong, please be aware * While in point of view of Muslim, God is still in heaven, He will judge people in The Last Judgement and gives His will and words through Qur'an and Mohammad. They also oppose Trinity of God. Muslim believe God is God, no companion of sons or daughter or even Trinity of God.<br>  <br>  Christianity's opinion:<br>  In Christianity's opinion, prophets are people who have give, sacrificed and devoted their life to God. They must not marry anyone, spread the word of Bible and keep the peace. From these category, some Christians accepts Mohammad as a prophet, but it also a  complicate argument between those religions. In one side, Mohammad is a great figure of prophet who spread the word of God and demolishes occultism.On the other hand, from point of view of Christian extremist, he isn't a prophet because he is going to war for several times, building an army and conquered land. He also introduced Jihad , literally means die for God, which identic with terrorism, said 11 September attack. He married with prostitutes and loved by people which, again, strongly against Christianity's words. <br>  <br>  In Muslims' opinion, Muhammad is declaring a war againts occultism which is one of the words of God. They may think that Christians is even worse than them. Back to 1095-1272, Christian empires, such as France and Britain, had declared 9 'Holy War' without an exact purpose. Even worse, pope, as hand of God, gives permissions to go to the wars. <br>  <br>  He may have married with prostitutes, but he has purpose to save their life ( in olden days a woman who caught sleep with a man, not her husband can be stoned to death by public). It is weird to say that someone must be hatred by society. <br>  <br>  Even Jesus is loved by society, he just mentions that he will be hatred by scholars who are too strict with Torah.

God did not have to come and suffer on the cross for our sins.. He is the Almighty, He can forgive us as He wills and Punish us as He wills... He is the Merciful. Jesus (as) himself used to pray to God and tell us to pray to God and not to him. and you think God would pray to himself the night before he was crucified? <br>  <br>  Qur'an 4:158, "God has raised him up unto HIMSELF". <br>  this verse means that Jesus(as) was raised to God... very clear. <br>  but this is merely the way of saying ...  that Jesus(as) was not raised to the rank of God but to ( like belong to ) to God. He was raised/called to God. <br>  <br>  and another common argument being that God came down to earth in the form of man to live amongst men and teach them. <br>  But God created us and is watching over us. so He doesn't need to come in a human form to "experience" all this.

Every religion is only evolving a God out of the material person, and the same God is the inspirer of all of them. Why, then, are there so many contradictions? They are only apparent, say the Hindus. The contradictions come from the same truth adapting itself to the varying circumstances of different natures. <br>  <br>  It is the same light coming through glasses of different colors. And these little variations are necessary for purposes of adaptation. But in the heart of everything the same truth reigns. The Lord has declared to the Hindus in His incarnation as Krishna, "I am in every religion as the thread through a string of pearls. Wherever thou seest extraordinary holiness and extraordinary power raising and purifying humanity, know thou that I am there." [Cp. Gita 7.7, 10.41](10) And what has been the result? I challenge the world to find, throughout the whole system of Sanskrit philosophy, any such expression as that the Hindus alone will be saved and not others. Says Vyasa, "We find perfect men even beyond the pale of our caste and creed." <br>  <br>  One thing more. How, then, can the Hindus, whose whole fabric of thought centers in God, believe in Buddhism which is agnostic, or in Jainism which is atheistic? The Buddhists or the Jains do not depend upon God; but the whole force of their religion is directed to the great central truth in every religion, to evolve a God out of a human being. They have not seen the Father, but they have seen the Son. And he that hath seen the Son hath seen the Father also.|`|6LBJgACSaa	wow lol ok if you want to discuss Christianity then you can email me.

When I consider my actions I try to think of how I would feel on the receiving end. This (of course) does not always hold sway, and I am as prone to slippage as any other person on a 'strait path.' who claims their behaviour is guided by holy writ.However I do not believe in a permanent Hell because a deity that unforgiving would be as petty as Zeus. He was a poopyhead to Prometheus, for sure! Nonetheless if it does exist I'd avoid it if I can - for any righteous person, no matter their apparent faith or lack thereof, serves the true religion - and if it isn't there, well, I'll be none the wiser.  <br>  <br>  Being 'good' is hard, really hard when you don't lean on a deity - why should I pester my deity-of-choice when '' saw fit to bless me with faculties to deal with my obstacles? Only in direst darkness should I ask for help, otherwise I am merely thankful for peaceful, uninteresting times. Since prayer is also a means of tricking oneself into the motivation to help oneself (maxim: the Lord helps those who help themselves, and they aren't talking about cake or territory), I allow myself to be skeptical. Reading the musings of great minds produced in my heritage's faith has expressed that agnosticism is not only widespread amongst my fellows, but even accepted by the Lord, who, it has been argued, would have little use for a child who could not ask questions and discover the means of  understanding (what may be) '' 's work. It is not surprising to me that many so-called 'morals' are no more than common sense rules of basic social interactions. They were just lifted from what was considered 'civilized' to begin with and legislated.<br>  <br>  So I tend to label my personal precepts as 'ethics,' and take the central human myth-tree as allegorical in nature for the most part.|`|25f9a2c75c4db980c3d9c8f7f8a1383aaa	While I'm not very religious, I do like the "do unto others" bit.  While it is not guaranteed or even suggested that treating people like you would want to be treated means they will always do the same, I feel better about things if I've acted in a way that I wouldn't mind seeing in someone else.

xuuaMTmtaa	I feel the EXACT same way.<br>  <br>  I was a pretty strong supporter of our campus GLBT group. UNTIL...<br>  <br>  I was made the trans poster child.  Everyone in the group used ME as their poster boy for promoting gender identity and expression in our campus anti-discrimination policy.  MY discrimination issues are always brought up when anyone asks why we need GLBT equality on my campus.  So, now I can't just be seen as Riley.  I'm forever known as "that trans guy Riley".  IT SUCKS.  I CAN'T escape my identity now.  <br>  <br>  However, in going to this group, everyone expects me, since I'm the "T" in GLBT..that I should just automatically support whatever cause the gays and lesbians have decided to take on this week, just because I'm lumped into their group.  I'm expected to know the struggles gays and lesbians face, and to support their fight for marriage equality AND how they go about doing it (I don't believe waving rainbows in people's faces is going to make you listen to them, sorry) However...no one in the group that identifies as gay or lesbian, seems to know much if ANYTHING about trans related issues.  Nor do they seem to WANT to.  <br>  <br>  Instead, I get harassment from them.  I get the "stop saying your discrimination is "special" or different than ours" or "you think your oppression is so much worse than ours". Oh really? Interesting, because not too long ago, you were MORE than willing to put my "special discrimination" on display for the entire f**king campus to hear about, and USE that discrimation to further your OWN agenda, with NO regards for my feelings on the issue or how I'D feel about being outed and pushed into the GLBT spotlight.  But now all of a sudden when I mention how I feel used and exploited, I'M wrong??<br>  <br>  So yeah, my GLBT group on campus?? They can suck my inverted penis.<br>  <br>  But as far as the education goes.  DEFINITELY.  I'm SOO tired of hearing myths, and misinformation about trans people especially.  What REALLY saddens me, is when gays and lesbians don't even understand us, and we're supposed to be in the same "community".  It bothers me when I see and hear little "baby dykes" and newly out people who don't have a clue about gay history, yet feel perfectly ok in waving their rainbow flags high and proud and pride parades, not even knowing the fight that went on to give them the ability to wave that flag.  So yes, there NEEDS to be some honest, truthful, ACCURATE information out there coming from reliable sources.  It's not a 'who's gayer' thing, it's a ' we need to stop the ignorance, and someone needs to do it' thing.|`|nXBPXVnkaa	I get his point. I understand that he doesn't want to have his sexual orientation be the only thing about him, since it's just ONE part of who he is. But I also think LGBT studies are important. There's so much valuable history there. The stories need to be told. It's not about who is "gayer" at all.|`|08QtgdpOaa	I understand where he's coming from. I also agree with him somewhat. Society seems to draw excessive attention to peoples' homosexuality. A few times I've been introduced by someone to another person as "my gay friend Jo". That really irks me. There are so many things that I am that are weirder and more unique than me being gay. I am not ashamed of being gay, but I agree with your friend. I want to be seen as Jo, not gay Jo.<br>  <br>  But as there is still segregation and misunderstanding between heterosexuality and all other sexualities, I do think that LGBT education would be beneficial. Though, this would have to be handled with care as it is open to all kinds of bias and misinformation.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	I'm like you're friend.<br>  <br>  If i'm asked to describe myself, "homosexual" isn't on the list. <br>  <br>  I don't participate in the over-the-top gay pride that exists because I think it's silly. I'm not "proud" of being gay, but i'm not "ashamed" of it, either. I'm gay...so what? I don't need to attend group meetings and parades to be content.<br>  <br>  I've been with my boyfriend for over three years, and we've lasted this long because we both share the belief that we're a "couple" - not a "gay couple".<br>  <br>  As far as education...I think it's important that people understand that heterosexuality isn't the ONLY thing that exists. It never has been...and I doubt the professor is teaching anything other than that.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	If he wants to have his opinion, fine but it doesn't sound like he has thought this through very well. Besides, he didn't need to email the LGBT group to complain about it just because HE doesn't want to be part of it!  He doesn't have to be known as "gay rick" but I hope he doesn't think that he is "no different than straight people."   The difference is, heterosexuals have rights and they don't need to show their pride and march in parades and sign petitions to be allowed to marry the love of their life.  Gay people have to fight for their rights, and life is a bit different for us because of this.  And yes, all human beings deserve fair treatment, but some of us have to fight for it. THAT is why so much attention has been placed on this subject. Not to pointlessly cram it down people's throats.  Students DO need to learn about homosexuality, the truths and the myths, and all kinds of aspects of homosexuality.  The world doesn't need any more ignorant people in it, and they WILL be ignorant if nobody teaches them the truth about LGBT people!  Without these kinds of courses, many people out there will grow up thinking that everyone should be be heterosexual, and they'll think that homosexuals are the ones spreading aids and have no right being gay or have kids or marriage...  A professor doesn't need to be gay in order to help educate people on homosexuality.  I had several white history teachers teach us about black history in school and I don't recall anyone having a problem with it.  The world has all kinds of people in it.  If Rick thinks that homosexuality doesn't need to be part of scholastic studies, then he is pretty stupid.  It is the lack of this kind of education that is contributing to the ignorance and violence against homosexuals.  Many people are misinformed and/or lied to at home about gay people for various reasons, and it should be taught in school.<br>  Tell Rick that ignorance kills, and this is a matter that should concern him, since he is gay (and ignorant in my opinion).  It isn't the only part of who he is, but it certainly is an important one.  Nobody gay NEEDS to run down the street waving a rainbow flag but we don't need gays telling LGBT that we don't need their courses offered at school, either!  Jeez, Louise, how stupid.

xuuaMTmtaa	To be curious about something is to ponder on, or sometimes even obsess over something you have yet to experience. <br>  <br>  To BE bisexual is usually a KNOWING of your attraction to both sexes, either physical and/or emotional.  One does not necessarily need to KNOW their orientation through practice however.  One can self identify their own sexual orientation, with or without ever going through a sexual experience.<br>  <br>  This is how we have gay men and lesbians and straight men and straight women that are virgins, but still are undoubtedly sure of their sexual attractions. <br>  <br>  I'd say if you're having thoughts, and pondering the idea, haven't went there yet, but still unsure if you're ready to actually call yourself bisexual, I'd say you're bicurious.|`|uzTUspgLaa	i'll help you figure it out. email me at rrunge777@gmail.com<br>  <br>  i'm Rachel, a 17 year old bi female =)|`|746ca2c53622d04682bc14ec21b57e9daa	i think it means that bi curious is someone who is just curious about the same sex and opposite and never takes part though<br>  <br>  bisexual is someone who is comfortable and attracted to both sexes|`|WeR0E56eaa	bicurious is the term called for people who  wants to test the waters with both sexes... if they liked both sexes then they already call themselves bisexual. lol

D6FBLQfwaa	Im not a believer, but I know what others believe about this. First off, there was no hell before Samael (Satan) fell from grace. The reason he fell from grace, is because God wanted to make Humans, which he would hold closer and love more then the Angels. Samael did not want anyone closer to god then he was, and in his jealously he openly disagreed and was thrown from heaven. Along with him was thrown other angels who were also jealous.

UOBvuImUaa	Before I answered this question , I wondered why you thought these scriptures may prove the trinity so I read through your previous questions & sure enough I think I found the reason you asked this .<br>  Re your question about Mat 9:3<br>  This was your typical answer.<br>  <br>  Since only God can forgive sins, He was either God in the flesh or the greatest blasphemer of all time.<br>  <br>  The way I see it , is the real basis of your question about the trinity come down to Mat 9:6<br>  6 But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins...." <br>  <br>  So the real question is about Jesus having authority .<br>  Did Jesus have authority or was he given authority ?<br>  <br>  The answer to this question can be found in Matt 28:18<br>  18 Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <br>  <br>  How if Jesus is God (God in the flesh) he would not need to be given authority . <br>  The scripture clearly states Jesus was given authority , so he could not be god but the son of God to which he said he was many times.<br>  <br>  So to get back to your lead in question . No Matt 9:4-8 does not prove the trinity . In fact it proves the trinity as a false teaching.|`|5qjxyb0jaa	Well , I feel these scriptures disprove the trinity.<br>  I just want to say that Insurrection Rebel just gave an amazing answer & I can not really add to it .<br>  <br>  Insurrection Rebel how did an Atheist come up with such a well informed answer , with scripture & all ? <br>  You amaze me .|`|AA11654248	I think you'd need to prove the bible is true before claiming the meaning of each verse|`|rLCx5ljQaa	the whole point of faith is not having evidence or proof of any sought|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Jesus would have used this opportunity to say he was God at this time, if he was God.

We all have inherited this sin & thus get sick, old & die. - Romans 5:12<br>  <br>  Jesus words here show that he had authority over this inherited sin while he was on the earth. This authority was given to him by his Father.<br>  Nowhere does it say that Jesus is God<br>  Notice in verse 8 it says they praised God not Jesus<br>  <br>  The Trinity doctrine has pagan roots.

These verses do not claim that Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  Some may think that only God has authority to forgive sins, hence, Jesus must be God. Yet these verses themselves say that that authority was granted. Again, some may claim that that was only the crowd's perception - that Jesus only appeared to have been granted authority, when in reality Jesus was God unbeknownst to the majority of the crowd. But, Jesus himself says that authority had been "granted" to him in Matthew 28:18. This shows that Jesus didn't always have such authority.|`|oGVvEl3Maa	dear brother...<br>  no. i do not believe that there are any verses that 'prove' the Trinity...<br>  although in my limited understanding of Truth... i could be wrong...

However, the New Testament does bring God (Father), the Son (Jesus Christ) and the Holy Spirit together in such a way as to strongly imply the Trinitarian  nature of God.<br>  <br>  If we look at Scripture with an open mind regarding what it says about the being we call God, it's clear that he is shown to be Triune in nature. We can confidently say that the Trinity, as a truth regarding God's essential being, has always been a reality. Perhaps it was not completely clear in the dim ages of man, including even in the Old Testament. But the Incarnation of the Son of God and the coming of the Holy Spirit revealed that God was Triune. This revelation was made in concrete fact, in that the Son and the Holy Spirit broke into our world at definite points in history.<br>  <br>  EDIT...Those who deny the Trinity do not have the Holy Spirit to open their minds to understand the Scriptures.|`|CXJiTMbdaa	Also read words 28 & 29<br>  28.

Jehovah is God.  Jehovah has given his only begotten son privilege, glory and Kingship over his Kingdom.  If one is desperate to prove trinity then they need to step back, look at the facts and do research.  Jehovah, Jesus and Holy spirit are not one, Holy Spirit is Jehovah's active force, Jesus is the firstborn of creation, the only begotten son of Jehovah, Jehovah is God Almighty, Alpha and Omega.  He was not created, had no beginning, will have no end.  <br>  <br>  There is no trinity, will never be a trinity and If one does not like seeing that they are being taught wrong by their church then do something about it.   We are admonished to flee from the disgusting thing or share in her destruction.<br>  <br>  Keep this mental attitude in YOU that was also in Christ Jesus, 6?who, although he was existing in God‚Äôs form, gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God <br>  Philippians 2:5,6<br>  <br>  Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld. 2?For by means of this the men of old times had witness borne to them.<br>  Hebrews 11:1
q2ul38GQaa	1. Firstly, communication. If you go to a foreign country you will have a better time if you speak the language than if you don't. No matter what language you speak, there are way more people who don't speak your language so it helps to know at least a little of how to speak theirs.<br>  <br>  2. Following on from the above point, safety in foreign countries. If you speak the language people are less likely to immediately think tourist and rob you.<br>  <br>  3. It helps your memory.<br>  <br>  3. It improves your test scores and does seem to make you more intelligent.<br>  <br>  4. If you have minor experience in the language from family, holidays or even stuff you picked up in the neighbourhood/ at school or watching TV it is really quite easy at first<br>  <br>  6. I would say the majority of countries in the world border a country that speaks a different language like America bordering French Canada and Spanish Mexico so it is practical for communication with near neighbors. These days we are citizens of a particular country and global citizens.<br>  <br>  7. I live in New Zealand and if you can speak the language of the native people (Maori) you pretty much will get paid more for any government job or similar than someone who only speaks English. I imagine this is similar overseas. Even if you don't get paid more it will increase your job prospects.<br>  <br>  8. My Spanish teacher told us about a study from a dating agency which said people who speak a foreign language are seen as more attractive, smarter and sexier, which is always a plus.<br>  <br>  9. It helps you understand English better from learning about forms of verbs, parts of speech and parts of sentences. Also it can teach you English words. I wouldn't have known deshabille means partly dressed if it hadn't been for the French word habill√© which means dressed.<br>  <br>  10. It makes learning every subsequent language easier. I was pretty good at Spanish before I started French and although I got confused a bit at the beginning, it easier for me to remember both languages now.<br>  <br>  11. If you can speak one language, it helps you be able to speak another. I think if you speak Spanish you could almost fluke your way through a conversation with a Portuguese speaker and you'd both have a rough idea of what the other person meant.<br>  <br>  12. Foreign accents are sexy.<br>  <br>  13. It helps your confidence. Its pretty scary to speak a language for a start but once you get it, you can do anything.<br>  <br>  14. Bilingual people are more open minded and culturally aware. Knowing the language can stop you from making embarrassing faux pas when you are in a country/ with a nationality of people.<br>  <br>  15. It's really fun, just try it you might like it. =)|`|2ZkhsHXdaa	1: Some places you can't get a job without being bilingual<br>  2: If you ever travel<br>  3: Helps keep your memory in good shape<br>  4: its fun<br>  5: it helps you understand how people in other countries think<br>  <br>  <br>  Need more?

I'm an eighth Native American but I don't call myself Native American, because I'm not. A few of my ancestors were, but not me. My father is 1/4, but even he never calls himself NA. My grandfather was 50% and still didn't call himself NA (he called himself exactly what he was: half).<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I have a friend who doesn't even know how far back the Native American is in her family (but she isn't more than 1/16) and she refers to herself as "like almost full-blooded Native American." What really drives me nuts is when she talks about "her people." My grandfather used to live on a reservation, but no one in her family has even seen that side of Native American culture. She treats it like it's something romantic and exotic, but these are real people with real issues.|`|BKyFxjeBaa	gah. . like i said before it's QUALITY not QUANTITY.<br>  I know bloods that have NO clue.

That means that she has a great great grandparent that was Chippewa Indian. Every other relative of hers is either Norwegian, French Canadian, or Irish. She gets free health care, glasses, dental care, etc. along with some money for college because she is a rare "minority."<br>  <br>  And this is what gets me upset: She has blonde curly hair and green/hazelish eyes. Her skin is extremely light and she gets burnt when she doesn't wear sunscreen (and sometimes when she does). She has freckles.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what she looks like (COMPLETELY European) it's not worth getting upset over compared to the fact that she has absolutely NO clue about anything to do with Chippewa culture. She doesn't know where they lived, what they ate, etc. She doesn't even know what happened to them, and why there are so few today. Her life is not affected at all by the mistreatment of her one great great grandparent.<br>  <br>  My point: She is not disadvantaged because of that 1/16 Chippewa Indian in her. She has the same opportunities as anyone else in America.<br>  <br>  Where should we draw the line? When someone's life has been affected by the mistreatment of their ancestors. For example, many African Americans are still trying to recover from being greatly mistreated over hundreds of years after what happened to their ancestors. Jewish people are still affected by having a large fraction of their population (6 million poople) mass murdered. They, along with African Americans, are set back because of the mistreatment of their ancestors. THAT is where the line is drawn, I believe..|`|i9XnU8pkaa	I think it should be more on the basis of how you're raised.|`|DfDss68haa	I agree. I know I am part Native American but I don't know what what tribe and it is likely less than 25%. I shouldn't be able to go around claiming I am Native American. <br>  <br>  You are still going to get people who will insist they are Native American or constantly talk about their NA great grandma. And when pressed they can't even tell you which tribe. Take it as a compliment, but I cna see how it could get annoying. Telling people you are NA accomplishes two things:<br>  1. If you are a white person, it makes you something other than a boring white person with no culture of your own. I have heard people up in the Northwest love to latch onto NA monikers for street names and such to give Utah less blandness. It also gives white people that touch of exoctism without descending into inferior. They love to talk about an NA ancestor but strangely no black ancestors which doesn't make a lot of sense for many reasons. If your ancestors had no compunction about sleeping with an Indian they had no compunction about sleeping with a black person. Also many tribes intermingled with black people intensively so sometimes they two are not mutually exclusive. But 9/10 white people will admit to a NA ancestor before they will admit to a black one. If you are a black person claiming Indian ancestory means you are better than regular black people and are elevated and exotic. In their twisted minds of course.<br>  <br>  2. It shows the listener that the speaker has actual rights to this land. Ever notice how many white people love to talk about that way back NA relative? Yes it adds exoctism to their otherwise bland German, Irish heritage but it also it a ay to subtely say "My blood is rooted in this land through dent of my one NA ancestor." White people still have some guilt about that whole stealing someone's home thing and giving the homeowners who disagreed syphillis. It's a way to say that they have bought back the guilt by saying they are part of the original owners. All better now. I bet that really makes actual NAs very angry. I would be too.|`|ppR5kH4Yaa	I like the legal definition: enrolled in a federally recognized tribe or 1/4 or more by blood.<br>  <br>  I find that I really do agree with that except in instances where federally recognized tribes have NO blood quantum.  You end up with a 1/512 enrolled member of a tribe with no blood quantum and a 1/8 person unenrolled because their tribe has a 1/4 minimum blood quantum.  *That* I have issue with.<br>  <br>  In my job, I run an Indian Education Program, the federal government accepts those who are enrolled (obviously) and their children or grandchildren.  I like that too because it lets in those 1/8 and 1/16 people who would otherwise be left out.<br>  <br>  Still, once you get below 1/4 it is unlikely that a person will have lived thier life as a Native person.  It gets less and less likely as the blood quantum drops.  Still, it can't mean that it doesn't happen, it is just rare when it does.<br>  <br>  Regarding people with higher blood quantums (1/4 or more) that don't speak the language, practice the culture, etc, they are STILL NATIVE.  They're probably brown people who have faced discrimination because of their skin color and culture.  That may be a reason why they don't want to speak their language or practice their traditions.  These people should not be discounted just because they're Christian, live in urban areas, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: If you meet the legal definition you're Native, at least as far as I'm concerned.  If you're unenrolled but  your parent or grandparent is, I consider you a descendant.  If it is beyond your grandparent or nobody was ever enrolled, I don't consider you to be a Native person.<br>  <br>  That's just me.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	I might agree but I think there are different situations. Like in my case, the most I have of any race is maybe 1/8. I'm 1/8 Native American on my dad's side and 1/16 on my mom's. No race/culture really dominates my genetics.<br>  <br>  My dad is 1/4 Arab, 1/4 Armenian, 1/4 European (Dutch-Spanish) and 1/4 Native American. So really, what race would you say he's more of? He's just as Native American as he is everything else. His Native American is 1/8 Cherokee and 1/8 Blackfoot.<br>  <br>  Kate M, I'm a blonde with blue eyes and I'm more non-European than European. Looks doesn't disqualify you. I have friends in the Eastern Band of Cherokee who don't know dip about the Cherokees. African-Americans aren't recovering from squat. How is getting benefits for doing nothing but be black a hard life? I've lived on Indian reservations with my family. A lot of them are in poverty.

JEjj1BfBaa	listen.....I swear to god im not making this up.

By the way i live in seattle washington!|`|VV7L2ADHaa	Ha ha lol!! yeah in the movies vampires are always portrayed as beautiful and seductive, and i think that's because the media has romanticised the whole thing making the neck biting thing sexy.

In the novel Dracula, the vampire was an old man with red eyes and jagged teeth. Not a beauty at all. The modern, beautiful vampire is so because its more marketable. However using vampires and sex appeal isn't so new a concept, its just more prevalent today: there is a really old vampire novel called Carmilla. It featured a lesbian maiden and an equally hot vampiress who hunts her.<br>  <br>  For your second one: those fat goths who think they're vampires because they drink blood (or in the case of the "psy-vamps" who are too chicken to do it so try to suck "energy") are just wishing to be like vampires, mainly because vampires are beautiful, seductive, powerful, badass... basically the opposite of a fat goth.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	um. no not all vampires are beautiful. Though they are supposed to be very charismatic, people are attracted to them or their personalities.|`|rieKRjwkaa	Well, those "fat gothic people" aren't really vampires, that's cause they're mythical.<br>  <br>  But I havn't heard anything about vampires HAVING to be beautiful...I think it's the whole "seduce you into letting me bite you" romantic thing.|`|bFHkEGoCaa	well yes and no vampires can look average not to good looking and not to ugly<br>  and fat gothics aren't one of us|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	I dont know, i've never met a vamp that wasn't beautiful.

YupMCYHlaa	The phrase 'civil rights' really means the rights that every citizen has, guaranteed by government. This includes things like freedom of speech and religion, police and fire protection, the right to public education, the right to vote, all that stuff.  We often take all this for granted, we have grown up with these rights and we don't think about them.<br>  <br>  The Civil Rights movement in the 1960s was to guarantee that EVERY American has these rights, including blacks in the south.  Why should they not?  Why was it that 100 years after the Civil War, after we even had a constitutional amendment declaring that blacks are citizens too, with all the same rights, that blacks still didn't have the right to go to a decent school, or to vote, or to be equal before the law in the South?  I think it was about time we fixed that.<br>  <br>  Women too.  In fact women benefited more from the Civil Rights era legislation than blacks did.<br>  <br>  I don't think we are even yet to the point where blacks are completely equal, but we've sure made a lot of progress in 40 years.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	So everyone could be the same.|`|7uffHRdkaa	To provide African-American's equal rights, especially in the south.

2iwOIskRaa	Thats because most christians are di**heads who will judge you because they can. I am yet to meet a christian that hasn't been cold to me or discriminate against someone different and i know a lot of christians.|`|0EldIfVPaa	Not all Christians are like that. I'm sorry you've had such a bad experience but, truly, there are plenty of good Christians. That person who turned out to be so cold and unfriendly probably wasn't a real Christian, he just called himself one, or maybe he was a newborn Christian and for him it was a struggle. It's a shame, because we are supposed to set example and be "the light of the world", but when people meet someone who's like that person you've described, they turn away from Christianity. Sad. But do not lose hope. A Christian's conduct depends on how far that person has gone in their spiritual development. A more mature Christian will probably be more like what you believe Christians should be. Just don't think that if that one person was a jerk, all Christians are like that. It's simply not true.|`|VS9ewDRkaa	Haha....that is so funny cos I have the opposite reaction. Most of them i meet have a holier than thou attitude. <br>  <br>  If you aren't a christian, they will try to convert you.|`|a7282602981644d2fff09b1a41ac653faa	Intolerant<br>  <br>  Intolerant<br>  <br>  Intolerant<br>  <br>  Intolerant<br>  <br>  Intolerant<br>  <br>  Forgive them, for they don't know any better.|`|51WK9mGvaa	They have fallen from the True faith and are confused. Please read these next few passages from the Gospel of John very carefully, John 6, 47-69:<br>  <br>  47 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."<br>  <br>  52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus‚Äô body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in ‚Äúremembrance‚Äù as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‚Äò Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>   Now is your chance to come home to Jesus‚Äô one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is ‚Äúthe Holy One of God‚Äù and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|6jAVElX7aa	well christians do have an aversion to loud people, people who cuss or swear, people who are constantly making fun of others, people who visit the bars often. people who gamble,  people who are rude and discourteous, most christians will tell you that they are averse to this, so if you want to be friends, then be prepared this is part of their lifestyle.as they only wish to serve the Lord, and if you are interested in serving the Lord, also, they will become your friends.|`|jSjb5DUeaa	most of the christians i know are really nice people.but some i know aren't. so it depends on the person i guess.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Christianity covers a huge range of beliefs, so you can't really generalize.

Does it mean that we should not fly confederate flags over cemeteries where southern soldiers died?  Does heritage matter, even if it's in the past?  Slavery is in the past, isn't it?  Are people still affected by slavery?|`|BKyFxjeBaa	They do a re-enactment here as well. <br>  I've always wanted to get a few other indins an paint up get some horses.

Up to 65% of ethnic Russians and a significant number of Belarusians and Ukrainians identify themselves as "Orthodox". According to the data made public December 12, 2008, the Church had 157 dioceses including 29,263 parishes served by 203 bishops (another 14 are on retirement), 27,216 priests and 3,454 deacons; there were 804 monasteries, including 478 in the Russian Federation (another 25 are within the ROCOR jurisdiction), 87 theological schools, including 5 theological academies and 38 seminaries.<br>  <br>  The ROC should not be confused with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (also known as the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, or ROCOR), headquartered in New York. The ROCOR was instituted in the 1920s by Russian communities outside then-Communist Russia who refused to recognize the authority of the Moscow Patriarchy headed by Metropolitan Sergiy Stragorodsky. The two Churches reconciled on May 17, 2007; the ROCOR is now a self-governing part of the Russian Orthodox Church.|`|AA10181489	As all orthodox churches are in communion you can go to any orthodox church and have approximately the same experience.  You will find the orthodox quite similar to Catholics.  You can just turn up BUT because it will be so foreign you should call the priest first.

Even if people say they want to know and they ask questions, I am quite reticent about answering. Besides, my religion forbids proselytising, and there is a fairly shadowy line between openness and proselytising. I tend to think that if someone is genuinely interested they will ask me for a book recommendation and go and read for themselves.<br>  <br>  Another thing is, if I know that someone is a devout monotheistic believer, I know they will not understand where I am coming from. Keeping it quiet is just a way to avoid upsetting them. I suppose I do it out of consideration for their feelings, but also to avoid a fruitless thealogical debate.|`|dR9UyP6naa	As someone already said "I don't hide my faith but I don't elaborate it or go around announcing it either."

VcButISGaa	With the coming economic hardships, this idea is not crazy at all.  We have already seen reports of "tent citys" popping up aroung the US in major cities.  People are losing their homes to forclosure and jobs at alarming rates. and there may be a coming depression, if we are not in one now, in the US very soon.  It would be wise to learn how to live off the radar.  Start by learning to grow your own food.  food shortages are bound to happen if money becomes scarce around the world, populations rise meaning more hungry people, and prices soaring. also cheap foods that are gentically modified (google GMO food) is not good for you, so you will want to be able to grow organic healthy fruits and veggies, as well as raise animals to eat or learn how to hunt.  good luck and for more information check out alexansary.com he has great info about whats going on and preparedness guides|`|V7rA5yxjaa	Well if it's govt/private lands, isn't that still a form of squatting?

(Unless you are superstitious and believe in crap like Friday the 13th.)<br>  <br>  If you pick Friday, do it late in the afternoon (after classes, of course).<br>  Saturday would be a better choice though, because by then, you'll have already rested from school. (More energy to spare to last you the whole night!)<br>  You can go out to that place you mentioned and have your pics taken. Then grab your digital camera and go to some park or mall or just any place where you love to hang out and take your pictures. Then buy huge pizzas and stay over at someone's house (whose, that's your decision) and have some games prepared --- interactive games of course. (LOL at the Ouija board suggestion) Ghost stories would be totally fun for me. Or old school games if you have them. Like Twister and such. Those that involve body movement. <br>  <br>  Themed celebrations are also fun too. You can tell your friends to arrive in costumes or just silly get ups just for fun. And you can base your activities or games on the theme that you have decided on.<br>  <br>  Since you are still minors, those are probably the best ways for you to spend your celebrations. I think slumber parties are still a fun activity for 14 year-olds nowadays. (Not to mention safe.)<br>  <br>  Hope this gave you an idea. =]<br>  Happy Birthday to both of you in advance!|`|EQdDkSw0aa	Yh my neibhour is a party planner for girls 14 and under lol<br>  ....maybe he can be of some use?|`|GelbRB8qaa	Get a Ouija board from wal-mart or some store and call up fallen angels and such.

Evangelical Christian had been used by anti-Christian politicians etc to describe anyone with extreme views who calls themselves Christian (sometimes they are not only not Christian, but they don't even claim them to be, but people just want to label them as such).  Real Evangelical Christians encompass almost all Christians (although not usually Catholics).  Evangelicals believe in the gospel, and many beliefs are rooted in the Reformation, when there was a drive to go return to what the bible actually means, and being saved by grace.  Evangelicals includes lots and lots of denominations (baptists, pentecostals, charismatics, Lutherans, some anglican etc), agreeing to disagree on some issues.  The term Evangelical, however, has been high-jacked by non-Christians as a negative adjective to mean extremists - this especially appears true on R&S.  Check out something like the evangelical alliance statement of faith for what Evangelicals really believe (you'll find that there's no mention of evolution/young Earth creationism, just the basic truths of the bible)|`|rIvp1BToaa	not all are  but evangelical  is a group  that   can be  in every denomination  just some  welcome  them more than others  I go to a Congregational church  and we are  affiliated  with the evangelical alliance.  our pastor although  originally a methodist minister  believes  we need to be  spreading the Gospel also  which is what I believe evangelical comes  from  although they tend  to have  more new  songs  than  many churches  its all the same faith.
AlrCZJ3saa	Well what i would really be worried about is new age cancer and ronoson chirogodas. Take a seat, this information  is important. Ronoson Chirogodas have been able to tear people apart limb from limb, then if/when they come in contact with somebody it spreads new age cancer. New age cancer is the strongest cancer on the planet, it defies the laws of physics and has a mind of its own.

v4YCheYoaa	Save your self the phone bill and have the computer talk to you in Spanish. TypeIt ReadIt is a text-to-speech program that can be downloaded for free at <a href="http://www.schoolfreeware.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.schoolfreeware.com.</a> It can reed Spanish with a Spanish voice installed in the computer. This can help with your pronunciation and the program has a Spanish spell checker (not the greatest spell checker but it works). Just type or cut and paste text into it and it will read back. It can also save to a sound file so you can listen to your Spanish documents on your iPod or mp3 player. The problem is that the program does not come with a Spanish voice. A voice has to be bought from a different company than from Schoolfreeware.

HvIS1Mk1aa	Here is a free lesson for life. Ready?<br>  <br>  If just one dogs bites you, isn't it wise to assume all dogs will bite you?<br>  <br>  There is no survival value in judging people kindly; there is only survival value in judging people harshly.<br>  <br>  Kool, eh?<br>  <br>  This is why some of us "old" people have little time and no respect at all for the young. In my experience teens are stupid, slow, lazy, spoiled, lethargic, incompetent, self-indulgent, useless and best seen but not heard. In fact, I am constantly amazed by those who do eventually turn in to a half-way useful adult.<br>  <br>  More, some of us don't care whether you're annoyed or not because - and this is the bit teens seem to have trouble understanding - teens in general are just not important enough to bother with one way or the other. I just don't give a f**k about how you feel or what you think about me, others, the world, the universe or anything else.<br>  <br>  In short, the views and opinions of teens are worthless, as far as I'm concerned.<br>  <br>  Now, taking all this on board, doesn't it make sense to to accept that the age divide is just too great to bridge, at least in some cases, and that some of us wrinklies just don't like teens?<br>  <br>  Hmmmmmmmmmm?|`|W0qNkROpaa	I've noticed that some older people do treat teenagers in a way that they would not treat another adult, for no reason other than that they are teenagers.  I'm not a teenager anymore, but I still notice it.  At a classical concert, I recently saw a man poke a 17-year-old boy in the back and tell him to shut up, when the boy had done nothing more than whisper to the person next to him.  I doubt the man would have done that to a person his own age.|`|qky7gWosaa	I agree on several levels.<br>  <br>  The elderly never recognize that they were teenagers once themselves. During the teenage years, we all behave badly and it is a phase of being adolescent.  But on the other hand, i think as teenagers, we need to be polite to the elderly, seeing as they are aged -- they should be treated with great respect. It also depends how parents  raise their children. In my culture, we have to significantly value our grandparents.|`|en9Xk0h2aa	We are all tarred with the same brush by so many older people. Today I held the door open for a few people (like I always do) and only one said thanks. The amount of times when older people just let the door slam in my face, or just barge past me, whereas younger people are more polite. I find older people more rude! <br>  <br>  When I was waiting on a train station there was a group of young lads sitting on the first bench on the platform. A very elderly lady came on the platform with two other people who were about middle aged. All the lads got up and offered her a seat, and the old lady thanked them, but her companions COMPLETELY blanked the guys. I thought that was pretty rude.|`|SMtTONPQaa	I totally think the same thing,<br>  eh older people allway's think as if there better, yet they don't even act there age, they allways try to lower us and say that we need to grow up, lmao. i so understand you|`|yB0nVXfWaa	My dear, it is so nice to find a sweet and respectful teenager about these days, but I have to say that, in my experience, this is often not the case.  In fact, I am quite shocked when I do.<br>  <br>  Actually, it's not just that.  In all fairness, many are reasonably polite, but you can read from their manner that they are bored with you.  They want to get away just as soon as they meet you.  They get fidgety and the message you get is 'hey, I want to be with my own, because you old folk are boring'.<br>  <br>  Have you ever walked through town, gone into a store and felt to be 'invisible'?  Well, it's happening to me regularly now and I know why.  It's because I'm 'older' and people look past me now and pretend I'm not there - particularly young people.  I just don't feature on their radar, because I'm not 'young and hip'. <br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt now, because I'm strong in the Lord, but I do notice it and, d'you know what, I feel so sad, because all this is evidence of a big 'generation gap'.  Like you say 'the teenage community'.  This has happened ever since the '50s and '60s' when young people suddenly got an identity and a lot of money and - like it does - it went to their heads.<br>  <br>  You know, I really like teenagers, a lot more now that I'm, let's say, 'older'. That, and little kids, because I've never understood them better than I do now.  It must be the 'grannie' thing! It's all on the surface with them and I really like that transparency, honesty and earnestness, because I remember what I was like - actually, still am.<br>  <br>  Because I'm still a kid inside, though the outside has changed.  All older folks are, when you rub the surface.  And that's what I think is so unfair about the divisions in our society between young and old (and those in the middle, working hard to hold everything together!), because every group ends up inward-looking and estranged from the other, and it's not meant to be like that.  It's so lonely.<br>  <br>  We have so much to give each other - both ways.  You young folk keep us young and up to date with things, and we older ones can tell you about history, comfort you when it gets too much and give you 'the benefit of our wisdom'.  With neither dominating.<br>  <br>  Nobody's judging, but it is right to make assessments and say what, in our opinions, is right from wrong.  Because if everything's right, then who will sound a warning?  <br>  <br>  Grans and grandads can see these things coming and, actually, that's their 'job' - if you like.  Because they've seen these things before, they're given wisdom to try to warn the younger ones so that they don't make the same mistakes.  But if you only listen to your peers, then you will, most certainly, make the same mistakes.  We just want to save you from the suffering we went through, that's all, and have the joy and benefit of your company.|`|Q2aOmKvBaa	You are soo right.

But i have found that it is mostly through fear. The few young people that spoil things for the majority is what is the problem for you. I had a similar experience when i was about 13 (i'm 25 now). In my opinion you can either accept it or do something about it. I Decided to do something about it. I approached my local youth service and asked what i could do about it. From this i joined a young persons political group called YOMAC (youth of moorlands action council) where we had a chance to have our say and make a difference. I also began to look for funding for a young persons cafe which was a place for young people who wanted a chance to make a difference and also meet new people, or just wanted something to do. It took 2 years but now its a cyber cafe with local respect and has people of political influence in the community stopping in all the time. In return for all my efforts i was awarded an award for youn people called the Rebecca Harris trust fund which was a certificate for my hard work and Ôø°100 cheque. So to sum it up if you want older people to respect you show them what your all about. Good luck

SCkhQc2Caa	A brief summary of the requirements for the Ghusl follow. <br>  <br>  First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. <br>  <br>  Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. <br>  <br>  Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl.<br>  <br>   As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (peace be upon her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. <br>  <br>  After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. <br>  <br>  He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.)<br>  <br>   In the narration of Al-Bukharee it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs<br>  _______________________________<br>  <br>  The causes that make ghusl a must are:<br>  <br>  1. The emission of semen, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "What requires water (ghusl) is if you see water (i.e., semen) coming out of you." (Reported by Muslim, no. 1/269)<br>  <br>  2. Contact between the genitals, because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "If one part enters the other part (in another report: if one part touches the other part), then ghusl becomes obligatory." (Reported by Ahmad and Muslim, no. 526) This ghusl is obligatory whether or not fluid (semen) is released. "touching" here refers to the entry of the tip of the penis into the vagina, not mere touching.<br>  <br>  3. Menstruation and nifaas (post-natal bleeding), because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ". . . And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allaah has ordained for you. . ." [al-Baqarah 2:222]; and because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said to Faatimah bint Hubaysh, peace be upon her: "When your period starts, stop praying, and when your period ends, perform ghusl then start praying again." (Reported by al-Bukhaaree, Fath, 309)<br>  <br>  4. Death: the dead - apart from a martyr slain in battle - must be washed (ghusl), because when his daughter Zaynab - peace be upon her- died, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: "Wash her with water three or five times, or as many times as you see fit" (Reported by al-Bukhaaree, al-Fath, 1175); and when a man who was in a state of ihraam was killed by his riding-beast, he said: "Wash him with water and lotus leaves and wrap him in his two garments, but do not embalm him or cover his head, for he will be raised on the Day of Resurrection pronouncing the Talbiyah." (Reported by al-Bukhaaree, Fath, 1186)<br>  <br>  There are other types of ghusl about which the scholars differed as to whether they are obligatory, such as performing ghusl on Fridays, or whether a person who becomes Muslim needs to perform ghusl upon entering the Faith.<br>  <br>  There are types of ghusl which are encouraged, such as: ghusl on the two Eids; ghusl after washing a dead body; ghusl before entering the state of ihraam or entering Makkah; ghusl for a woman who is suffering from istihaadah (abnormal non-menstrual bleeding) before every prayer; ghusl after being unconscious; and ghusl after burying a mushrik. (Tamaam al-Minnah by al-Albaani, p. 120). <br>  ______________________________________|`|89a4e35709fd20d8fa340ef1d5a3bac3aa	Salam for you. I agree with Dr Shahky's answer. as the correct way to take fard after menses.<br>  e should say bismillah before fard bathing and say alhamdulillah after finished it|`|UxYkISitaa	shaykhy's answered the Q. u want me to answer it? i'll just copy that and paste it again if u want!|`|9p2wQ21Aaa	What should one intend when performing ghusl? <br>  <br>  <br>  The person performing ghusl should intend one of three things: <br>  <br>  <br>  1) Performing the obligation of ghusl <br>  2) Removing major ritual impurity <br>  <br>  3) Permitting what major ritual impurity prevents <br>  <br>  <br>  What are the rulings concerning consecutiveness in ghusl? <br>  <br>  <br>  Consecutiveness in ghusl is obligatory, just as it is in wudu'. The rulings in section 28 (regarding the one who forgets consecutiveness in wudu', the one who is unable to do it and the one who deliberately introduces delays) similarly apply in ghusl: <br>  <br>  <br>  1) If someone introduces delays out of forgetfulness, then he must build on what he has done, whether a long time has passed or only a short time. However he must renew his intention. <br>  <br>  2) If someone introduces delays due to a lack of ability, without being himself the cause of that inability, then the ruling is the same as for the one who forgets in that he builds on what he has already done. He does not, however, need to renew his intention. <br>  <br>  3) If someone introduces delays due to a lack of ability, when he himself is the cause of that lack of ability, then he must build on what he has already done, if only a short time has passed. If a long time has passed then he must repeat the entire ghusl with a new intention. <br>  <br>  4) If someone deliberately introduces delays, then the ruling is the same as for the one in the last instance (number 3). If a short time has passed, he builds on what he has done. If a long time has passed, he repeats his ghusl. This ruling is for the one who deliberately introduces delays in his ghusl without nullifying his intention. <br>  <br>  5) If someone deliberately introduces delays and abandons his intention, then he must renew his intention and begin a completely new ghusl, whether a long time has passed or only a short time. <br>  <br>  <br>  How many sunna elements of ghusl are there and what are they? <br>  <br>  <br>  Ghusl has five sunna elements: <br>  <br>  1) Washing the hands before putting them in the vessel, provided that there is only a small amount of water, that it is possible to pour from the vessel and that the water is not flowing. If there is a lot of water, or it is not possible to pour from the vessel (such as a bath tub which is fixed to the ground) or it is flowing, then he may put his hands in it. <br>  <br>  2) Rinsing the mouth. <br>  <br>  3) Sniffing water up the nose. <br>  <br>  4) Blowing water out of the nose. <br>  <br>  5) Wiping the ear holes. The one performing ghusl should not go too deep or be too forceful when wiping, because it might harm his hearing. As for the outside and inside surfaces of the ears, it is obligatory to wash them because they are part of the outside of the body, which it is obligatory to wash. <br>  <br>  <br>  What is the recommended way of performing ghusl? <br>  <br>  <br>  The recommended way of performing ghusl is the manner in which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, performed it. This ghusl contains all the obligatory elements, sunna elements and recommended elements and is thus the most complete way of performing it: <br>  <br>  The one performing ghusl begins by washing his hands three times, as in wudu', intending by that the sunna of beginning with the hands. Then he washes any impurities from his body and makes his intention to perform the obligation of ghusl. <br>  <br>  After making his intention he begins by washing his genitals, inner thighs (which are next to his genitals), anus and between the buttocks once. Then he rinses out his mouth, sniffs water up his nose and blows it out. Then he washes his face and completes his wudu' washing each limb once only. <br>  <br>  Then he pours water onto his head and, using his hands, making sure the water penetrates to the roots of the hair and covers his entire head. He does this three times. Then he washes his neck, shoulders and upper arms to the elbows. <br>  <br>  Then he washes the right side of his body down to the ankles, front first, and then does the same with his left side. He must make sure he rubs every inch of his body if he is able. If he is unsure about whether he has washed a part of his body, and is not someone who is regularly subject to doubt, then he must wash it as soon as he remembers it. Otherwise (if he is someone who is regularly subject to doubt) he may ignore that doubt and does not wash the place he has doubt about.

Much of what they say is moral is really immoral. Because they say that what they teach is the word of god there is no way to correct the errors except by rejecting the whole lot.<br>  <br>  So I do.<br>  <br>  There is no god and all his prophets and believers are liars and crooks and even if what they tell you to do is good they don't give a good reason to to the good thing. Doing it because god says so would be a bad reason.<br>  <br>  Doing it because they tell you god says so is acting on a lie and the lie is a bad reason.<br>  <br>  And you have to decide whether to follow any religion so your judgement about whether or not to accept it MUST be independent of and superior to anything the religion says.<br>  <br>  So your internal morality cannot help but be more important to you that what religion teaches.<br>  <br>  Just reject the religion and use your own judgment about what is moral and what isn't.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	One and the same. A flexible religion is called science.<br>  <br>  After all, Christianity contains all of the popular "scientific" theories of the Middle East 2000 years ago.

r8rykCkGaa	Just be what God wants you to be, but I have a suggestion:  that you put on the full armor of God before getting out of bed in the morning and spend 30 min in prayer and Bible reading before leaving the house and pray constantly, cause when you start living the life and standing up for the truth you will get trouble, but if God is protecting you, then you can quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.<br>  <br>  So, do God's will and stand up for what is right and be strong.  (Read Ephesians 6:10-18 and II Cor. 10:3-5, Matt. 5:3-12, 16).  God bless you.|`|rvmiK8rgaa	Any suggestions?<br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make love your goal.

You should clarify your understanding of it with your teacher.|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	There is such a thing as constructive criticism. This is an affirming type of giving your opinion and stating how you see the good. You can also give helpful suggestions to the person. We can not live without some form of criticism but the trick is to never lose sight of the fact that all criticism is some ones opinion. We do not have to fear what others say about us. If we do the best we can and can take advice and constructive help from some one that is not immoral or wrong. If the criticism is just for devious and cruel purposes then of course it should not happen and is morally wrong|`|FnCvyXVDaa	Openly criticizing each other can be a bad idea as not everyone is constructive in their criticisms. As if teenagers aren't insecure enough.  As a Christian it can also be perceived as judging others.  As far as you voicing your opinion on what is morally acceptable to you, that is fine but don't start getting "preachy". You can act different without having to explain why.|`|hQDapmICaa	Natasha!

Just try not to go over the top and try not to force God onto anyone or criticize them or their religion because then they will get really mad at you and might start going on about how they think you are a hypocrite.<br>  <br>  PS I kind of relate because there is about three Christians in my school and I'm one of them.|`|POFB30K9aa	I know what you mean by people calling you a hypocrite for saying something is wrong now, when you have done it in that pass.

You can also pray for them, if they shut you down when you try to explain yourself. <br>  <br>  I don't really think that criticizing people in a class exercise is all that bad. I cant really speak to much on that, because Im not in that situation...but if that is what God has put on your heart, you should pray about it, and see what God direction for all of this is. <br>  <br>  I hope I can help...and I will be praying for God to shed some wisdom and insight upon this for you.|`|LIY8QrgMaa	Criticism is a good thing. I'd be really pissed if no one criticised me, because its the only way to make yourself better in life. The feedback others gives you helps you to change, and become better for everyone and yourself.|`|OKClYfDQaa	Criticizing isn't wrong as long as it is at the right time, at the right place, and directed to the right person. Circumstances must dictate. You need not be a holy and sinless man in order to see what's wrong; you just have to know. And never fail to include yourself in the criticism if you aren't sure of all the facts.<br>  <br>  Your past don't matter if you're really determined to be what you're now. Say, "Yes -- you're absolutely right: I was what you're saying; but that was before. I am what I am; I am not what I was. Just consider what I'm saying now; or else, you may consider as if you heard nothing."<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
q2ul38GQaa	I think you should go for it! When you're 30, the fact you started university a year later than some of your high school classmates will mean nothing. Also I think it will be cheaper in the long run because you will have work experience and maybe foreign language experience which will help you get a job and the point of university is studying so you can get a better job and while you're on your gap year you should be able to put some money aside for next year when you go off to university. When you're on your gap year you will do some amazing stuff which should give you new perspective on life and help you decide what you want to study. If you go to university not knowing what you want to study, it is likely that you will get frustrated with a subject that isn't for you and you could drop out. Think of it this way, you can go to university when ever you like, maybe even when you're 40 but this is one of the few chances you'll have to truly experience a gap year before financial, study, job, social and family commitments tie you down a bit further.<br>  <br>  I do mainly higher level classes at school which means I'll be able to graduate a year before my peers and I am definitely going to go on a foreign exchange or take a gap year. You could even combine the two options and do your first year of university overseas if that is possible through an exchange program or scholarship.<br>  <br>  Good luck, whatever you choose, you will have a great time and you will be better off for having done it.|`|tffxOaOpaa	ive had Lots of experience with this stuff<br>  my older sister decided NOT to do a gap year<br>  and it turned out to be the worst thing she ever did<br>  as school is somewhat like uni, its just like adding another 2 or 3 or 4 years straight on<br>  and after do 12 years of long gruelling school its good to have a break and truly apprieciate life<br>  when it was my turn, i took a gap year, and it was excellent!<br>  the stress the school brings totall vanished, and i traveled with friends and did lots of stuff etc<br>  and by the time my one year was up i was feeling totally fresh, like id just had a nice long shower<br>  what have you got to loose?<br>  i say live life!  :P|`|NHvYiT27aa	it all really depends on what u planning to do after school and now would be a good time to start thinking bout it properly you cant leave it hanging or you'll never know where your life will go. if u gonna study something that will require u to be studying for a few years then a gap year wouldnt be a good idea.<br>  are you going to a university oor just a college?? because you also need to apply to these places months and months ahead and theres achance that you will get rejected.<br>  <br>  start thinking big or you could be working at mc donalds if you know what i mean|`|wAVjk3Ylaa	i didn't take a year off but i so wish i did! <br>  <br>  at the time i thought i'd get uni over and done with as soon as i could and start living. but the actual fact was, i took uni completely for granted and just cruised through without putting in a lot of effort. when i started working, i realised how precious it was to have all this time for studying and how important it was to work hard. <br>  <br>  i wasn't sure what i wanted to do, i just took up whatever seemed more 'employable'... so i took marketing and international business. but now i wish i did something i was truly interested in, at least i would've put in more effort and actually enjoyed it. i guess if i had taken a year off, my maturity level would've been more appropriate too (i got into uni when i was 17)<br>  <br>  take that year off... i think it really opens up ur eyes and for u to fully appreciate uni. <br>  <br>  edit: i know it's expensive, so u need to think about how u would finance that year. otherwise there's no reason not to do it. being at uni a year later doesn't mean anything, nobody's going to think you're dumb for being a year older. what's one year's difference compared to your life?|`|4apYtDp7aa	you might forget all the stuff you need, so it really depends on what you've got that really interests you, and also you will be starting with like 1 year older than everyone else.|`|D2cCZVQXaa	I graduated in 2007 so I'm not much older than you.

They believe that the world would be overrun with violence without God to set rules against it.<br>  <br>  But the very fact that they believe this proves that they are wrong. If the image of a world filled with violence inspires such a strong desire to avoid it, then surely that in itself can serve as sufficient motive for rational people to behave.

The reason that some people are more moral than others is not becasue they hold within them a set of rigid dogmatic principals on the ideas of live, and the worhsip of a' good being' but by understanding and appreciating the feelings of others. <br>  People who do wrong cannot empathise with those they do it to, they feel no connection with those people and what they are going through. People who are moral do, and this is the only difference. It does not hinge on religion teaching, else children who had been brought up without religion would be intrinsically bad, but they aren't are they? They feel guilt, they know when they have done wrong. It is inbuilt in us as huiman beings.|`|51WK9mGvaa	Please read these next few passages from the Gospel of John very carefully, John 6, 47-69:<br>  <br>  47 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."<br>  <br>  52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus‚Äô body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in ‚Äúremembrance‚Äù as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‚Äò Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>   Now is your chance to come home to Jesus‚Äô one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is ‚Äúthe Holy One of God‚Äù and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|a48cfffc5a668f8ee11c890acdaf3ccfaa	I think it is scary that some humans live amongst us who abstain from killing others only because they are afraid of punishment (eternal torture).<br>  <br>  Speaking for myself, I am a social mammal, need and want other humans to accept me and also need a safe environment for myself and my child.

Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus‚Äô body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in ‚Äúremembrance‚Äù as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‚Äò Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>   Now is your chance to come home to Jesus‚Äô one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is ‚Äúthe Holy One of God‚Äù and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|p0bB4nW1aa	This is not an uncommon question. Why now? No one can answer that. All things happen in His timing. This is no different than the criminal who asked God into his heart as he hung on the cross next to Jesus. It is never too late. We all have skeletons in our closets, the question is how can your experiences help the Kingdom of God. We all have our own gifts and experiences to bring to the table. Yours just may be the thing that shows someone else how awesome is the grace of God.  That regardless of what we do or say he loves us enough to forgive any sin. <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to sound preachy, but this is exactly the situation you find yourself in. When in doubt pray.

He's the way, our only way back to God. <br>  <br>  In Jesus Christ, God desires to establish an intimate relationship with you now and through eternity. Say "Yes" to him. He loves you so much and accepts you as you are, no matter what you've been through.<br>  <br>  However, his love for you is so great that he won't let you stay as you are. He desires to transform you into the likeness of his Son, into his likeness; that you may dwell with him, that you may live in him forever.<br>  <br>  Just remember though: the Church (I mean the people, not the building) is a great family to be in; however, it still consists of as yet imperfect people. Be patient, be forgiving as God is.<br>  <br>  God has always been calling and waiting. And he is the one who enables us to hear him. It is when we hear his voice that we should not harden our hearts, but rather listen, trust and obey. There's no other way to live this life to the full than being at peace with God and our fellow humans, in Jesus Christ our Lord.<br>  <br>  Receive the Lord Jesus Christ and be a part of his Body, the Church. Remain in him and in his Body.

GItBUBL9aa	Kent Hovind is a total fraud that has knowingly misrepresentd scientific data and fooled a lot of Christians with his nonsense.  It's no wonder he got 10 years for tax fraud; he's a con artist.  His doctorate is actually from a mail order diploma mill.  <br>  <br>  Many Christians like myself have no problem with a big bang, or God working in an evolutionary process. Day is used figuratively for a period of time in many scriptures, and the day/age theory of the creation believes there can be millions to billions of years between the days.<br>  <br>  The order for the creation parallels the same order science gives. First comes the heavens (stars, etc.), then an empty earth without form, then land followed by oceans, then plant life followed by the first intelligent life in the sea, then comes birds (which according to science are descendants of dinosaurs), then mammals, then a more specific wild animal, and finally man. It's actually amazing that it gives an order 3,000 plus years before science confirms that same order.<br>  <br>  Adam is not created until after the seventh day, and the day/age theory believes the man created on the sixth day is not the same as Adam who is first mentioned after the seventh day. That allows for cave men, and explains where Adam and Eve's children found wives, since there were people before them.<br>  <br>  As far as intellegent design, when some Christians latch onto a world that is 6,000 years old, the thought of "not intelligent" comes to my mind. They need to be convinced that science is not the enemy, that science actually corroborates the biblical order. Likewise, non-religionists need to explain how Genesis came up with the same order as science, considering how that might relate to intelligent design.|`|vNvtwuBfaa	We biblical creationists are concerned with what scripture says, not Kent Hovind.<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:7<br>  And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.<br>  <br>  The firmament is the atmosphere where the birds fly (Gen. 1:20).  In the original creation, there was water above this firmament.  We are not sure what form it was in, or how high up it was.  But biblically speaking, an ice-canopy is certainly worthy of being among the considerations for what this might possibly mean. <br>  Scientific evidence - it's just a theory, and may not be the case.  However, you may have noticed that the earth is 70% covered in water.  Some of that could very easily have come from a collapsed canopy.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  To answer your question:<br>  Gen. 7:11<br>   11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.<br>  <br>  As I'm sure you realize, there are unlimited variables when dealing with such a theory.  I'm just remaining open to the available scientific options.<br>  As anyone who's had 6th grade science knows, the closer to absolute zero ice becomes, the more of a magnetic charge it has.  The earth also has a magnetic field. Such a canopy could have been suspended by the Meissner effect.<br>  Such a canopy would likely increase the air pressure, but not to the drastic measure of liquefying it.  The increased pressure would make the whole earth like a hyperbaric chamber - people pay lots of money to go into these chambers in medical facilities and many professional sports teams have them because they promote radically faster healing.  The air found in crystallized amber pockets have twice as much oxygen.  The increased pressure and oxygen offers a great explanation of how pre-flood people lived to be so long, and how the dinosaurs grew to be so big. (Also, water blocks UV rays - that could be a very healthful benefit!)<br>  <br>  As far as explosiveness is concerned, that's not doubtful at all.  The flood was quite violent, as noted in the verse above and other places in scripture.  All the water did not come from the rain, but most came from subterranean water chambers, just like we have today, only they were still full before the flood.  Now, most of that water is in our oceans.<br>  The gravity that keeps our atmosphere here now would also have kept it there after the collapse of such a canopy.  Although, it's not quite like it used to be.<br>  These are all just theories, but they should all be left on the table as possibilities while we all strive to learn about the world around us. I'm not settled on this theory either way, but I find it to be extremely interesting.

z3z7e8uQaa	The Pericope Adulterae (pronounced /p??r?k?pi ??d?lt?ri/ in anglicised Latin)[1] is a traditional name for a famous passage (pericope) about an adulterous woman‚Äîverses 7:53-8:11 of the Gospel of John. The passage describes a confrontation between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees over whether a woman, caught in an act of adultery, ought to be stoned.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Authorship<br>  <br>  [edit] Arguments against Johannine authorship<br>  <br>  Bishop J.B. Lightfoot wrote that absence of the passage from the earliest manuscripts, combined with the occurrence of stylistic characteristics atypical of John, together implied that the passage was an interpolation. Nevertheless, he considered the story to be authentic history.[6] As a result, based on Eusebius' mention that the writings of Papias contained a story "about a woman falsely accused before the Lord of many sins" (H.E. 3.39), argued that this section originally was part of Papias' Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord, and included it in his collection of Papias' fragments. However, Michael W. Holmes has pointed out that it is not certain "that Papias knew the story in precisely this form, inasmuch as it now appears that at least two independent stories about Jesus and a sinful woman circulated among Christians in the first two centuries of the church, so that the traditional form found in many New Testament manuscripts may well represent a conflation of two independent shorter, earlier versions of the incident."[7]<br>  <br>  [edit] Arguments for Johannine authorship<br>  <br>  Zane C. Hodges and Arthur L. Farstad argue for Johannine authorship of the pericope.[8] They suggest points of similarity between the pericope's style and the style of the rest of the gospel. They claim that the details of the encounter fit very well into the context of the surrounding verses. They argue that the pericope's appearance in the majority of manuscripts, if not in the oldest ones, is evidence of its authenticity.<br>  <br>  Although in line with many stories in the Gospels and probably primitive (Didascalia Apostolorum refers to it, possibly Papias also), most scholars agree that it was not part of the original text of John's Gospel.[2] The standard Greek texts of John, and almost all modern translations, mark it off with double brackets‚Äî[[...]]‚Äîindicating this opinion.<br>  <br>  The English idiomatic phrase to "cast the first stone" is derived from this passage.[3]|`|y6zJbaK7aa	Sounds itchy... go see a doctor.|`|H5dVqlBJaa	submarine envy?

However, your body is still tuned in to your sex drive and in that respect, you are still gay.  <br>  People do not choose their sexual preferences, and remain so their whole life.<br>  People who try to hide a lifestyle or ignore or change it warp their chances for happiness.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	A lot of people claim this.<br>  <br>  My personal belief is that they are either:<br>  <br>  A) In deep denial or<br>  B) were never gay to begin with - just confused.<br>  <br>  Anyone can be brainwashed, voluntarily or otherwise, into believing they are something they're not....but that doesn't mean it's healthy.|`|D25VA3r3aa	People don't become straight or gay, they're born with their sexual orientation. Yet some gay people decide to act against their feelings at some stage in their life, or throughout their life due to pressure to do so. Their are plenty of people who are gay, yet are with a woman due to religion, social pressure, low self esteem and plenty more reasons. A gay man can easily have sex with a woman, they are no repellent, it is just we find men a lot more attractive anddon'tt find women attractive, we can choose to act against or instincts, but we wouldn't be as happy. a lot of doctors warn against it, as it is damaging for you to be unhappy or act against your nature.|`|msVBFJpwaa	There are some who claim that, but personally I feel they were never gay to begin with.  Or they're fooling themselves into thinking they're straight.<br>  <br>  And just because someone has so- called "feminine gestures" doesn't make them gay.  I have a friend who people automatically assume is gay, just because of the way he acts, but he's as straight as they come.|`|SIkcSsuRaa	yes there is. tons. im not one of them. im not a fairy.|`|1NuKii8qaa	No. Why should they?|`|yZbtteBiaa	It's possible that the person was unsure to begin with, but it highly unlikely that they were gay then, if they now choice to say they are not. It's a proven fact that in men, a chromosome is mutated, and that Truly gay men do not choose to become gay they are born gay. <br>  Perhaps your friend was having mixed feelings, bisexual, or in denial.

But they are still human. Perhaps the term is a little degrading. I have never hated homosexuals and even though I am atheist most of the gay people I have known have been clean well off and educated. That and they seemed to be gay even when we were kids. I grew up with a single mom who did nothing but lady stuff like sewing shopping and cooking and gossiping and I played football, basketball, baseball, ride and race motorcycles when I have the chance to. The argument," his mom hugged him too much or did not let him play with boys growing up" does not apply. The thing in my brain that attracts me to women works opposite for those individuals. What kind of god would create something to punish it for what it is. That's like making a shovel and telling it to do something else because digging and using tools is illegal.|`|z3z7e8uQaa	i believe it also means lesbian|`|1YxQmh1iaa	It's not just Christians that thinkj that you know...<br>  <br>  It's the dictionary definition... assh*le|`|VS9ewDRkaa	If you mean gay as in happy then i guess quite a few.|`|djRz1NoYaa	I'm pretty sure everyone thinks being gay is in fact gay.|`|In49ckm7aa	It's the gayest thing on the planet.

Same as the Lord Himself. Satan on the other hand was jealous, hated God, and was obsessed with power, therefore was kicked out of heaven, so now wants to make mankind rebel against the Lord, as he will use lies and subterfuge to make people turn away from God, and follow him to make chaos and war on God's creation.|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	God is all powerful.

Who told you that you would suffer in hell after death? especially if you are a good and loving person. So you have not gathered the Perfection to believe in God. You believe in imperfection, yet you recognize that if there is imperfection, there must be Perfection. Hell, is knowing that there is Perfection and not choosing to join with that power.|`|6jAVElX7aa	telling yourself you are a good person is sort of deluding yourself, as no one is good only God is good.

A creator cant be created nor it can be self created also. We cant have a tall & short or hot & cold object. We cant have a created Creator.<br>  ‚ÄúFaith in Unseen‚Äù forms the basis of today‚Äôs science and electronics. The boundary of the universe is 13 billion light years away from earth. It keeps expanding at the speed of light. One light year is the distance travelled by light in one year. In 1 second light travels 300000Kilo meters. Sun light takes 8 minutes to reach earth from the time of emission. We cant even imagine 1 light year.  We can only keep of adding 10 raised to so many powers using our super computers, but cant perceive as a human. When we don‚Äôt know the boundaries of our universe how can we say the location of the Creator? We cant define him precisely living in this world. So attributing human feature to God like fighting, talking etc is irrelevant.<br>  Religion & God are universal phenomena required for living in this world. Religion is just not visiting Churches on Sundays or mosques on Fridays or to temples on few auspicious times of the week. Religion is a way of life, an universal set of rules to govern each moment of our life. Today we have so many confusions and problems in spite of so much technology and scientific knowledge. Bcos each started to think he is right, no need to have any belief or religious control on his actions. HIV Aids, Nuclear bombs, Terrorism, Green house effects are all due to man‚Äôs mistakes. He started to lose control over his own life. So religion is needed for our life. We have to use our intelligence and identify the correct one among existing religions. Every moment of life should be controlled by the ethics of religion.|`|wGQvgeXDaa	In the name of God, the Most Compassionate, the Most Merciful.<br>  <br>  In Islam, one is enjoined to be of high morals and to do good and forbid evil and to do so under the banner of belief in God. We believe that anything that one does should be done to seek God's pleasure alone, because He is our Creator and He is Compassionate towards all His creations whether they are believers or not. He lets people to be free in this world, giving them sustenance despite their disbelief. In reality, we do good things because God causes us to do these things, without Him we are utterly powerless. The orderly and wise system of our bodies, the order and design in the universe points to His Necessary Existence. And this order also points to the Necessary Existence of only One God for how can there be two presidents in one country?<br>  <br>  A fool is someone who is ignorant of the signs in life and in the universe, arrogant even despite His weakness and limited understanding. Therefore, it is a great transgression against His Mercy and His Will to deny everything that points to Him and would be a JUST thing to put us in Hell because of the denial of His Rights over us as His creations. Disbelief severs the connection between man and God. Without belief, man can be considered lower than animals for animals are also good and loving to their degrees of disposition.<br>  <br>  It's a pity that people believe in Heaven and Hell, and Punishment without fully understanding the wisdom of worship and submission. Indeed, man is given to forgetfulness.|`|NbmnWwqEaa	I do not believe in Hell . . . <br>  Well, at least, not like religions make it . . . <br>  <br>  Hell is being in a physical body, here on earth, where we have to feel pain, physical and emotional until we, once again, merge back with God (or Universal Power -- as it is an energy and not a person) and return "home".<br>  <br>  God/The Universal Energy is "unconditional love" . . . thus, it cannot feel hatred or banish you or anyone else to some furnace below the ground . . . for that would make it "CONDITIONAL" love.<br>  <br>  An energy of PURE LOVE cannot be PURE HATE at the same time.<br>  <br>  No, God, nor anyone suffers more than when they live here on earth.<br>  <br>  Of course, life can be happy and joyful . . . <br>  Just sayin', being in physical form is exactly what Hell is for the eternal soul within us . . .longing to shed these physical bodies and be one with the Universe again. Which we do at the moment of physical death.<br>  <br>  And there is no suffering in death . . . except for those who must live on, physically, without the person they love.<br>  <br>  The only other Hell is Phoenix, AZ most of the year . . . in the 120 degree heat where you really can fry an egg on the sidewalk.

If hes not 100% good? he must have a conscience.  And if he has a conscience. How is he supposed to past judgement on anybody?  <br>  <br>  I think God is more Passive!

Its like your son asking you if you would be happy that he is in jail about to receive the death penalty.<br>  <br>  God created us, and it is up to us to win our salvation. He can't just poof anything away. What would we learn? Just to always call to Him and to erase our problems away.<br>  <br>  God is a Father, a Parent, A Friend, He is Love!<br>  <br>  if God did not exist, explain miracles. Non-believing scientists always try to come up with reasons to find that God does not exist. There is no proof God doesn't exist. But there is proof that God does exist. If the big bang actually did happen, then it was just a coincidence that if the world was 1 centimeter closer to the sun we'd burn, if it was one centimeter back we'd freeze.<br>  <br>  It's like this...<br>  <br>  one day your walking in a desert and you find a watch in between the sand. are you seriously going to believe that through out time the sand hitting each other, and rocks and other materials made that watch? i don't think so.<br>  <br>  Something to ponder about.<br>  <br>  "Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind." ~ Albert Einstein|`|0EldIfVPaa	It's wonderful that you are a good and loving person, and God certainly wants you to stay that way, but if you don't accept His gift for you, i.e. if you don't believe that Jesus died for your sins, then you will not get to Heaven. The Bible tells us that "the wages of the sin is death." Christ paid for your sins by his death so that you could live and not die because of sin. If you accept what Jesus did on the cross, you accept God and you will get to Heaven. <br>  "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me." (John 14:6)|`|dq0L2jsAaa	Romans 5:14<br>  Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 15:22<br>  For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.<br>  <br>  So, to escape hell, one need to seek LORD JESUS for forgiveness of the sins we are born with. Hope this helps. Thanks.<br>  <br>  edit: Ezekiel 18:23 Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign LORD. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?|`|kjqVSekZaa	well in Islam at least, the only sin God will never forgive is to worship a false god. ive never read anything that deals specifically with athiests who dont worship at all though i wouldnt be surprised if athiests and pagans are grouped in the same lot|`|3MfrJASdaa	Even if you are a really good person if you don't believe in God you will not go to heaven.

I have decided, in my own right, to pursue Christianity. I am thankful that my parents allowed me to make the decision myself. <br>  <br>  The reason I don't think either is a huge issue, is because ultimately,either way will induce the child in question to form an opinion of their own, in the way of spirituality, as children do not stay children forever.|`|H5dVqlBJaa	if they were muslim kids they'd go to mosque or it would be 'honour killing' time you mincey little puke

I too share this with you in Love.|`|N9dsJgwcaa	Quite simply, intercessory prayer is the act of praying on behalf of others. The role of mediator in prayer was prevalent in the Old Testament (as in Abraham, Moses, David, Samuel, Hezekiah, Elijah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel). But Christ is pictured in the New Testament as the ultimate intercessor, and because of this all Christian prayer becomes intercession since it is offered to God through and by Christ. Jesus closed the gap between us and God when He died on the cross. He was the greatest mediator (intercessor) that ever lived. Because of this we can now intercede in prayer on behalf of other Christians, or for the lost, asking God to grant them repentance according to His will. "For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5). "Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us" (Romans 8:34).<br>  <br>  A wonderful model of intercessory prayer is found in Daniel 9 as he prayed for his people who had turned away from God. It has all the elements of true intercessory prayer. It is in response to the Word (v. 2); characterized by fervency (v. 3) and self-denial (v. 4); identified unselfishly with God‚Äôs people (v. 5); strengthened by confession (v. 5-15); dependent on God‚Äôs character (vv. 4,7,9,15); and has as its goal God‚Äôs glory (vv. 16-19). Like Daniel, Christians are to come to God on behalf others in a heartbroken and repentant posture, recognizing our own unworthiness and with a sense of self-denial. Daniel doesn‚Äôt come and say, "I have a right to demand this out of You, God, because I am one of your special, chosen intercessors." He comes and says, "I'm a sinner," and, in effect, he says, "I don't have a right to demand anything." True intercessory prayer seeks to not only know God‚Äôs will and see it fulfilled, but to see it fulfilled no matter whether it benefits us and no matter what it costs us. It seeks God‚Äôs glory, not our own.<br>  <br>  The following is only a partial list of those for whom we are all to offer up intercessory prayers: all in authority (1 Timothy 2:2); ministers (Philippians 1:19); the Church (Psalm 122:6); friends (Job 42:8); fellow countrymen (Romans 10:1); the sick (James 5:14); enemies (Jeremiah 29:7); those who persecute us (Matthew 5:44); those who forsake us (2 Timothy 4:16); and all men (1 Timothy 2:1).<br>  <br>  There is an erroneous idea in contemporary Christianity that those who offer up intercessory prayers for others are a special class of super-Christians, called by God to a ministry of intercession. Nothing could be further from the truth. The Bible is clear that all Christians are called to be intercessors. All Christians have the Holy Spirit in our hearts, and, just as He intercedes for us in accordance with God‚Äôs will (Romans 8:26-27), we are to intercede for one another. This is not a privilege limited to an exclusive Christian elite; this is the command to all. In fact, not to offer up intercession for others is sin. ‚ÄúAs for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by failing to pray for you‚Äù (1 Samuel 12:23). <br>  <br>  Certainly Peter and Paul, when asking others to intercede for them, did not limit their request to those with a special calling to intercession. ‚ÄúSo Peter was kept in prison, but the church was earnestly praying to God for him‚Äù (Acts 12:5). Notice it was the whole church that prayed for him, not just those with a gift of intercession. In Ephesians 6:16-18, Paul exhorts the Ephesian believers‚Äîall of them‚Äîon the fundamentals of the Christian life. ‚ÄúIn addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.‚Äù Clearly, intercessory prayer is part of the Christian life for all believers.<br>  <br>  Further, Paul sought the prayer of all the Roman believers on his behalf: ‚ÄúI urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me‚Äù (Romans 15:30). He also urged the Colossians to intercede for him: ‚ÄúDevote yourselves to prayer, being watchful and thankful. And pray for us, too, that God may open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains‚Äù (Colossians 4:2-3). Nowhere in any biblical request for intercession is there any indication whatsoever that only a certain group of people could intercede. On the contrary, those who seek others to intercede for them can use all the help they can get! The idea that intercession is the privilege and calling of only some Christians is without biblical basis. Worse, it is a destructive idea that often leads to pride, a sense of entitlement, and Gnosticism.<br>  <br>  What a w|`|xelkbdbdaa	If you don't trust in Jesus Christ, you are correct.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Barry W, it still becomes clear to me, at the very least, that not praying to the One is not good. Asking a friend to pray is asking for intercession. And, it seems clear to me that asking another spirit that is in paradise becomes an act of reverance that is due to God only. There obviously must be others in paradise aside from Mary and the saints that are in paradise. Take the criminal who was crucified next to Jesus that confessed his belief. Would we be compelled to pray to him, though he is in paradise? I think it seems clear that we should pray to the One who is fully the author of all of these things. That can only be through Christ. So what does this say about praying to Mary and the saints? If they ultimately have no control, how can we rightly assume that they are interceding, if they are not God? Since we do not know what paradise looks like from this end, how can we perceive that Mary and the saints can intercede for us? They are awaiting their resurrection like the rest of the believers. That is what I got out of Scripture.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	the only prayers heard have to go through the right channels...The ONLY hearer of prayer is the Almighty God, Jehovah........no other prayers to others are heard. They are not allowed by God to hear and answer prayer and they obey.<br>  <br>  There is only one way...to Jehovah , through Jesus.<br>  <br>  Jesus is not privvy to the prayer but he is like a secretary who allows you in to see the boss.

Soon after, Hitler became the Fuhr (the leader of Germany), and he blamed the Jewish citizens for all of the problems of thier nation. Many historians say that Hitler singled out the Jews because his father was a Jewish man, and he left his mother when he learned she was pregnant. Maybe, in Hitler's mind, exterminating the Jewish people was helping his mother. That would show devotion to her, which is also good.<br>  <br>  Really, Adolf Hitler was crazy.

tGkFPA82aa	You know what?<br>  Yes. Yes it can. Thinking is a sin, doubt is a sin, I'm pretty sure attempting to comprehend other opinions also counts as a sin.<br>  <br>  And this is why people think Christianity is a cult. Not just because it's a way to get money from the poor, but because it's victims are terrified of seeing anything that might make them look for a better way.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Reading the opinion of others, no matter how ridiculous, is not sinful.<br>  <br>  Letting yourself feel angry, hateful, vengeful, or otherwise negatively about what you read - that could be sinful!|`|6aIuZZi7aa	It makes me feel entertained.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	How is reading sinful?

It is not restricted just to religion, but to all avenues of life where people can "do" things that are considered wrong by the majority and get rid of the guilt behind any of it.

bBBcbFmWaa	If it makes you feel any better, it happened in the generations before, but now it is on the news and in every body's faces. People want an escape from the world and the problems and think that sex and drugs are an easy way to feel better. You seem smart enough to know that yeah, tipsy and/or fooling around feels good and is fun for like an hour and then you're back to the real world. Only now the same old problems are back plus the new problems of lies, cheats, sneaks, gossip (if you are lucky) and babies, STD's, OD's car crashes, hospitals, death if you're unlucky. There are shelves and shelves of these biographies at Barnes and Nobel, or even your own school library. <br>  <br>  You'd think that after all this time humans would get smart and try to feel better by doing things that don't hurt us. I guess we aren't all that smart! You seem more intelligent than most, at least you notice and think about it. I'm not saying stay home and don't talk to anyone. A girl's got to have some fun. Just keep using your brain. If you think a situation is sketchy, listen to your big brain, because you will be right. Dumb people may not know it, but you will. Stay alert and you'll be fine. Maybe one day someone will write the story of your school days and how successful you are in making it through. I'd read that book.<br>  <br>  PS-- You SHOULD write a book. Keep a journal and you could make lots of fame and fortune later on. Maybe get it turned into a novel and amovie!

zJEIV53Laa	This may help you:<br>  <br>  - you can use "?qu√© pasa?" to reply to someone who is calling you.<br>  . you can use "?qu√© tal?" after greeting with "hola" or "buenos d√≠as," or even instead of these expressions.<br>  <br>  Be careful about using what the first answerer suggested.

Finally.  The Republicans have always encouraged racism and exploited it (and every other kind of intolerance) but in recent years it's not working for them.  They realized a few years ago that minority populations are growing rapidly in some important swing states, so they need to reach out to minorities.  So they've tried to peddle racism in 'code words'.  But the US as a whole is less racist than it used to be, so it's not working as well as it used to be.<br>  <br>  Electing a black president is an ENORMOUS advance for the cause of racial equality.  The Republicans tried as hard as they could to make Obama's race an issue, but with no success at all.  Even today we see lots of posts her on Y/A trying to point out Obama's race, but they just sound desperate.<br>  <br>  Racism is still one of the worst problems we have here in the US, but it's getting to be a smaller problem.

In fact thousands <br>  of very heinous crimes are committed by whites <br>  every year. It's just that white people are given the <br>  choice to be looked at as individuals instead of as "bad people". <br>  <br>  When white people do something terrible like a school shooting, <br>  killing their parents, torturing cats or something like that, <br>  the problem is looked for outside that person, meaning they <br>  look for an outside source for the behavior. Where they bullied? Sexually abused? <br>  <br>  When a black person commits a crime, they look to genetics<br>   to explain some inherent inferiority.<br>  <br>  White people, white Americans have commited countless crimes against humanity and yet have the nerve to consider themselves so much more civilized than anyone else.

gOF1wJLFaa	Well, first, praying is not going to get you anywhere. Keep this quote in mind, "The hard work of one, accomplishes more than the prayers of millions." A god is not going to  take care of this one for you. When you find someone, you can be proud of yourself for doing it.<br>  <br>  Have you tried joining clubs at school to find someone who shares your interests? Have you given online dating services a go? Try asking your friends to hook you up with their friends? There are also a lot of books about where and how to meet people.<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad though, MANY people have trouble with dating. It can be difficult. You will find someone though. Just don't get discouraged. Try not to let your self esteem get too down either. If you don't appear to value yourself, it may be hard for others to see your value. You should always show that you like yourself; that will attract others to you. You have a long time ahead of you to find someone. You are definitely not the only one that has not found the right person by the age of 21.<br>  <br>  As for your feelings of being alone and abandoned, remember that they are just feelings. It's just how you FEEL. Our feelings are not always reality. We can sometimes feel things that are the complete opposite of what is true.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	It would help if your appeals were aimed at someone real.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	You are so young, yet. You have lived only 25% of your life, if at that. Focus on the Whole, the community, instead of you. God made you human by being around humans. Open you will, completely to God, no bars held. Ask once and trust that what He does may not be your time nor your choice. But He knows what you are asking for. If it is good for you so be it. He is right there. I have experienced this in my life many times. They are called miracles. Another thing that comes to my mind, is that maybe, just maybe, he is calling you to a life with Him. To the intense life in the ministry. He is the ultimate power. Join your imperfect self to His power. If you do believe, the answer will be immediate. I am near the end of my life and I can tell you, miracles from God are a fact, but only if you let Him. He has great respect of your will. Stop the sorrowing for yourself and join His community, called the world of life. Here's praying for you! Que Dios te oiga! Asi sea!|`|J4lfOSPiaa	Angel, please forgive me but I have much to share I am just confused by your moniker and generic Avatar.  Did I miss a step in the gender?

"for my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts." (jer. 29?)<br>  <br>  as my pastor once said, "nothing can come into your life unless it first passes through christ's nail-pierced hand." if you truly love the Lord, ask him to fulfill you and he will. read the bible for comfort-- "he heals the broken hearted and binds up their wounds." psalms are really good. even king david struggled with depression. TONS of psalms are just his cries for help, and often he asks the question, dont you hear me God? but later he rejoices when he finds that God DOES answer his prayers, and during the waiting or the hurting, he is still with us. read Psalm 56:8<br>  <br>  the best advice i can give is, dont look for fulfillment in this world; it will constantly disappoint you. look only to jesus christ. also, when we're busy doing God's work, it helps get the focus off ourselves and reminds us of God's abounding love for us... and that will definitely cheer you up. :)|`|dGX35OCTaa	I realize that you are in a situation that is very painful emotionally.

The typical straight person wouldn't last in a relationship with a person of the same sex for over a year. :P<br>  <br>  Sounds to me that you've had some bad experiences and so gravitated more towards girls than guys... Which happens. It doesn't mean you aren't lesbian, it doesn't mean you "just need a good man" or anything. It means that you're young and still have a lot of exploring left to do.<br>  <br>  I personally would look into polyamory. If you're an honest, responsible person with awesome communication skills, and if you're not hung up on the idea of monogamy, you could just date a girl and a guy.

When you suspect such a thing is one thing, when you know it, deep down, then you are much older. When it is persistent, then, it is not healthy to dwell upon it. <br>  <br>  Ideas and notions are theoreticall and are only worrisome. But some things incubate and recur over time. Some set anchor and it won't go away. Then it all depends on how you learn to accept and even embrace reality.<br>  <br>  Can you handle the truth? Most people cannot handle the truth and sometimes the truth, isnt. Until you draw you last breath and fade to black, you must adapt to the apparant reality of the day or month.

We are in the end times as a Christian this feels like the matrix where we can see the spiritual war going on and most people see just the temporal.

How rich or pointless it is depends totally on you.  You need to get up and find a purpose in life, you need to search for a reason to live a "rich" life.  Be it helping other, or doing somthing creative that gives you a sense of achievement and satisfaction.  Sitting on your back, waiting for something meaningful to come along means you are too lazy to try and do anything in life.  You need to work in order to find a purpose.  Oh and don't take your job as a purpose, it is not a purpose but a means to an end, mainly to keep food on your table.  Purpose should be something creative that gives others as much satisfaction or joy and is usefu to them as it is for you to live.  Help others and you will find a grand purpose.<br>  <br>  As for committing suicide, that is the easiest option out of working at achieving somthing.  By committing this cowards act, you just proove that you are too weak to face anything in life and too selfish (you leave behind those who have loved you since you were born, what did they do to deserve this except to love you?).  Live for others, to help them to see them smile, not for your self.|`|MKWkPH2vaa	Your life is only pointless if you let it be. Just because you are not rich and famous and have a million dollars to wipe your *** with does not mean that your life is meaningless or pointless. Let me give you an example from my own experience. My parents have lots of money. Lots. And they are terrible people. They don't help me or anyone else at all and are self serving, money grubbing, hypocrites. Now to them and to many others it would seem that they matter more than me, because they have the money and I work at whataburger. But you want to know something. I would thank them for setting me free. I don't have to worry about the same stupid crap that occupies their thoughts on a daily basis. I can think freely and openly and help people and be a good person without having to worry about loosing face if I am seen with the wrong person in public or give a homeless man a couple bucks or a sandwich or pop off some rude comment or fart. You see, its all how you see things, its all in your perception of things. If you truly believe that your life is meaningless and you are a worthless person, nothing in the world would make you happy, not all the money, all the fame, all the adoration, all the love from another, all the houses and cars and land you could ever want but never be able to use. Not all the drugs or the whores, nothing. YOU have to decide if you are going to let your life be meaningless or if you are going to do something about it, or maybe you just need to realize all the good things you have going for you in your life and stop feeling sorry for yourself.|`|zyw4i3kRaa	Yes life is absurd<br>  so have as much fun with it as you can!<br>  think about it, everyone else is running around taking it dead seriously, isn't that hilarious?<br>  <br>  Make your own meaning in this life I say<br>  don't listen to any of Them & Their expert opinions,its ALL a lie|`|fjAdjVhkaa	I think the best way to move past those thoughts is to stop thinking about them.

Its really what you want to make of it. If you have a shitty attitude, then **** is going to seem like its ****! Your actions create your reality...and you attitude is what you base your actions off.

You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE in the online world these days, you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jhdpLhNcaa	Secret # 1 : In which part do you have problems?

Ve18FAnGaa	careful, they get mad and report you when you call him a zombie.|`|NeOwDBulaa	Perhaps he wasn't a zombie. I've heard that death by crucifix takes a while - even days - so it could be logical that he survived for three days.<br>  <br>  I think that the stories of the bible is just that; stories to give you that warm and fuzzy feeling. I do believe that Jesus was real, but I don't believe he came back to life or turned water to wine or what not. I believe that he was just a religious man who spread his idea of God with people and was sentenced to death for challenging the current religion.<br>  <br>  If you study ancient mythology, you'll notice a pattern in the Gods or "subGods" from religions of the east. There are a many who tell of their spiritual figure being born of a virgin birth, healing the sick and the blind, being crucified, and  being resurrected after three days. It was a popular telling in biblical stories, and not just in Christianity.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	What color Jesus was hardly matters..And no, he wasnt  "zombie" like in horror flicks|`|6jAVElX7aa	you dont understand do you when Christ died and was resurrected, Christ mentioned He had to go away or ascend to His Father in heaven as then the Holy Spirit could come and dwell within people hearts if they confessed and believed that Christ is Lord and God resurrected Him from the dead. So when a black person believes in Christ he/she becomes my brother or sister in Christ as we are both blessed with the Holy Spirit which proceeds from God through Christ alone. So you see Christ unites people, whereas you people who make fun, and those who dont believe rend the church which are the body of Christ as Christ is head of the church, rends the people apart with their unbelief.|`|vAdtlZDpaa	Your logicis anything but flawless.<br>  <br>  Jesus was a mortal man who achieved enlightenment in his lifetime, thereby allowing him to transcend his physcial body and be resurrected.|`|XlhR7ooHaa	Wait....um...was that just another chritianity bashing question?

That doesn't invalidate his teachings, many of which provide good moral lessons that are still relevant today (although he ultimately was still a product of his time, which would explain some of the more questionably passages in the New Testament). However, it's much more likely is that the biblical character of Jesus is based upon multiple individuals and ancient myths regarding the son of God. The three day resurrection is common to many religions, some of which are still practiced today, as is the virgin birth, the betrayal, the painful execution, and so on.|`|BgASHCXkaa	You forgot option C that he is purely a fictional character devised by men in power to serve their needs|`|cVPq3s9zaa	Look up "Zombie" in the dictionary.<br>  <br>  Jesus rose from the dead, but that doesn't characterize him as a "zombie", genius.<br>  <br>  <br>  I suppose you think those who were dead for any amount of time and brought back to life are technically zombies as well, eh?|`|VS9ewDRkaa	He is an average mortal man.

If it's concerning your immediate family then, for the most part, one has a right to know.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of our personal freedoms are being slowly eroded away.  I won't even get into the whole thing where companies can sell demographic info for advertising.  The government would LOVE to control every single freedom.  After all, if they wanted to, they could get a hold of every single text and cell phone conversation you ever had.  Nothing is private.  They could track you by satellite.  It's no longer BIG BROTHER, it's now Big BrotherHOOD.  <br>  <br>  The media doesn't help with this either considering that they splatter every single detail about celebrities for all to see.  Frankly, I don't care what Angeline Jolie is doing in her off time.  As long as she's not going out and killing a ton of people or hurting a bunch of people, then how does it directly affect my day to day life?  The same goes with things like the Oscars and the multitude of award shows.  It doesn't really matter in the big picture.<br>  <br>  I would like to think the majority of people like to know your business because maybe they care.  I have a lot of friends that genuinely care about my well being but the vast majority of them are mature enough to know that if I need to talk about things, then I'll go to them.  The remainder do need to be told but I'm not a jerk about it, I just say "I'm really not up to discussing it." or "Ask me that question some other time."|`|UdIybwRpaa	With regards to the octuplet mom and the bachelor "controversy", both of those people are obviously attention whores and they are getting exactly what they want.

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE in the online world these days, you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|d0apx2mUaa	Start off saying: How to be a good english speaker?

They might read the Bible but they are smart enough (unlike most atheists) to realise that the stories in the Bible are allegories (look it up atheists) which aren't meant to be taken literally.<br>  The more scientists learn, the more they realise that there is yet so much we don't know. They can see that there are so many wonderous things in the universe that must have had a degree of planning. Atheists think that everything happened by accident....eyes are 'accidentally' sensitive to light waves, ears are 'accidentally' sensitive to sound waves, etc etc. Most scientists aren't that close-minded.|`|bloGqdBqaa	we are in a different era now in the west, where most people are atheists (some claim to be christian but this is only for cultural reasons) hence, many may not study the bible.<br>  <br>  However, in the past nearly all of the best scientists were from the catholic church.

Some do, but I suspect that is actually a minority.<br>  <br>  Faith and Science are not incompatible, except to those who believe, usually without a valid reason, that Science somehow attacks their belief structure.<br>  <br>  OK, if you insist that the universe was made 6,000 years ago, and the findings of vast number of scientists over the past 200 years have shown that the universe must be far older that that, then you may have a problem, if your belief is not very strong.  But attacking others, because you don't have sufficient belief in your life, cannot be very good for bolstering your own faith, surely it can only cause problems for yourself?<br>  <br>  Just a thought.|`|nrme3EQuaa	GOOD QUESTION!<br>  so many non-believers talk about science and knowledge when they've NEVER READ Gods holy word!<br>  Its ridiculous!<br>  <br>  I don't want to be a hypocrite so I studied up on fairyology in detail so when people ask me why I don't believe in them I don't sound stupid like those stupid athiests do!

There is opportunity for rags to riches instead os stuck being a serf like your father and his father until the begining of time. You could be born an heiriss. Lose your money and become a beggar, marry a policeman and become middle class, and then win the lottery and be rich again all in one lifetime. If class is based on wealth, you could argue that class barriers are not as strong in societies where your wealth varies.<br>  <br>  If the society class is based on tradition or power or education  biological or ethnic markers, you have totally different scenarios where it is more difficult  to escape the class.|`|aYVVwjBXaa	not possible. those with the most money determine the class structure, and put themselves on top. as long as we have an unequal division of funds, there will be inequality in the class system.|`|7uffHRdkaa	It's not. You can withhold capitalistic elements in a mixed-type society/economy, but even there, you'd still have class distinctions. I'll give you some examples of how you can bridge the gap though. For example, if everyone had the opportunity to acquire free college education, like public education, more people would have opportunity. In Europe, especially England and Ireland (although possibly not England anymore), it's generally more available than in America. I'd say Japan (vouchers) has an effective system too. They make you take tests to ensure that you'll get good grades in college, so they don't waste their money. In the U.S., we have Financial AID for the poor in America, but it generally limits you to crappy schools, unless you're exceptionally smart. Trust me, there's kids at Princeton who aren't all that much brighter than Rutgers, but they're only there because their parents got the money. The kid with the degree from Princeton will initially be regarded higher in the business world, even if he's not as skilled.|`|3urQfMffaa	Karl Mark.

KGJGqFalaa	Jehovah's Witnesses do not believe there are new prophesies.  We only try to interpret already written prophesies with aide of God's holy spirit.  Why do we make changes:<br>  <br>  1) God reveals information gradually...many prophesies are interpreted by watching the world scene...which changes.<br>  2) Knowledge grows with age.  In our infancy we were not as spiritually mature as we are now 125 years later.<br>  3) The fact we are not infallible in prophesy interpretation proves one important fact many fail people fail to realize....ONLY GOD IS INFALLIBLE!  As for the gifts of the spirit such as the gift of interpretation...that has been done away with. Proper interpretation of the bible would come not through a supernatural gift but through diligent investigation and study of the Bible which is NOT infallible.<br>  4) One television evangelist said he does not interpret prophesies.  What was his reason?  Everyone he knows of who try to interpret prophesies always end of changing it or make adjustments.  <br>  My Point:  Any religion or group that claim they are infallible in any matter relating to faith e.g., prophesy interpretation, is a liar!<br>  <br>  <br>  How to recognize counterfeit Christians<br>  <a href="http://www.counterfeitchristians.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.counterfeitchristians.info/</a>|`|35mnR8c6aa	The stand is to not talk about it.

This is what they said in an article entitled 'They shall know that a prophet was among them' published in the Watchtower of 1 April 1972, page 197:<br>  <br>  "So, does Jehovah have a prophet to help them, to warn them of dangers and to declare things to come?<br>  <br>  Identifying the 'Prophet' - These questions can be answered in the affirmative. Who is this prophet? The clergy... have failed God... However, Jehovah did not let the people of Christendom, as led by the clergy, go without being warned that the League was a counterfeit substitute for the real kingdom of God. He had a 'prophet' to warn them. This 'prophet' was not one man, but was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students. Today they are known as Jehovah's Christian witnesses. They are still proclaiming a warning.<br>  <br>  Of course it is easy to say that this group acts as a 'prophet' of God. It is another thing to prove it. The only way that this can be done is to review the record. What does it show?<br>  <br>  [page 200] To Ezekiel, in his vision, and, symbolically to the modern-day 'prophet', the spirit-begotten, anointed ones who are the nucleus of Jehovah's Witnesses today, God gave something to eat..."<br>  <br>  Putting the word 'prophet' in inverted commas was done because they switched from applying the description of prophet from an individual (Charles Taze Russell, the founder of the International Bible Students) to a group of people today - a prophet class.<br>  <br>  However, if they deny they ever made any prophecies, then the thinking goes that they cannot be accused of any failed prophecies.

GItBUBL9aa	Jehovah Witness doctrine<br>  <br>  The sect known today as the Jehovah's Witnesses started out in Pennsylvania in 1870, as a Bible class started by Charles Taze Russell. Russell named his group the "Millennial Dawn Bible Study." Charles T. Russell began writing a series of books he called "The Millennial Dawn," which stretched to six volumes before his death and contained much of the theology Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses now hold. After Russell's death in 1916, Judge J. F. Rutherford, Russell's friend and successor, wrote the seventh and final volume of the "Millennial Dawn" series, "The Finished Mystery," in 1917. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society was founded in 1886 and quickly became the vehicle through which the "Millennial Dawn" movement began distributing their views to others. The group was known as the ‚ÄúRussellites‚Äù until 1931 when, due to a split in the organization, it was renamed the ‚ÄúJehovah‚Äôs Witnesses.‚Äù The group from which it split became known as the ‚ÄúBible students.‚Äù<br>  <br>  What do Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses believe? Close scrutiny of their doctrinal position on such subjects as the Deity of Jesus, Salvation, the Trinity, the Holy Spirit, the Atonement, etc., shows beyond a doubt that they do not hold to orthodox Christian positions on these subjects. Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses believe Jesus is Michael the archangel, the highest created being. This contradicts many Scriptures which clearly declare Jesus to be God (John 1:1,14; 8:58; 10:30). Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses believe salvation is obtained by a combination of faith, good works, and obedience. This contradicts countless Scriptures which declare salvation to be received by faith (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5). Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses reject the Trinity, believing Jesus to be a created being and the Holy Spirit to essentially be the power of God. Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses hold to a ransom theory of the atonement, in which Jesus' death paid only for what mankind lost when Adam sinned - namely, the right to perfect life on earth. Thus, they believe in a faith + works arrangement, where sin and death are freely atoned for by Christ, but physical perfection is attained through personal effort, coupled with faith in Christ.<br>  <br>  How do the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses justify these unbiblical doctrines? (1) They claim that the church has, over the centuries, corrupted the Bible, and (2) They have re-translated the Bible in what they call the New World Translation. The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society altered the text of the Bible to make it fit their false doctrine ‚Äì rather than basing their doctrine on what the Bible teaches. The New World Translation has gone through numerous editions, as the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses discover more and more Scriptures that contradict their doctrines.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses are readily shown to be a cult that is only loosely based upon Scripture. The Watchtower bases its beliefs and doctrines on the original and expanded teachings of Charles Taze Russell, Judge Joseph Franklin Rutherford, and their successors. The Governing Body of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society is the only body in the cult that claims authority to interpret Scripture. In other words, what the Governing Body says concerning any Scriptural passage is viewed as the last word, and independent thinking is strongly discouraged. This is in direct opposition of Paul's admonition to Timothy (and to us as well) to study to show yourself approved of God, a workman that need not be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of God. This admonition, found in 2 Timothy 2:15, is a clear instruction from God to each of His individual children in the Body of Christ to be like the Berean Christians and search the Scriptures daily to see if the things they are being taught line up with what His Word has to say on the subject.<br>  <br>  The Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses should be commended for their ‚Äúevangelistic efforts.‚Äù There is probably no religious group that is more faithful than the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses at getting their message out. Unfortunately, the message is full of distortions, deceptions, and false doctrine. May God open the eyes of the Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses to the truth of the Gospel and the true teaching of God‚Äôs Word.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mormons<br>  <br>  JW's use the same books of the Bible as all protestants.  But Mormons have additional scriture, namely the book of Mormon, Pearl of Great Price, and Doctrines and Covenants.  Joseph Smith wrote in his book of Mormon about an ancient civilization in America that were related to the Jewish people, and that the garden of Eden was actually located in America.<br>  <br>  Against the accuracy of the book of Mormon are these scientific criticisms:<br>  <br>  The lack of any correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and American archaeological sites.<br>   <br>  References to animals, plants and technologies in the Book or Mormon that did not exist in pre-Columbian America.<br>  <br>  The lack of any linguistic connection between any Native American language or language family and any Near Eastern language or language<br>  <br>  The absence of any DNA evidence linking Native Americans with descendants of Israel. <br>  <br>  <br>  According to the Smithsonian Institute of Washington, D.C., USA, the following items (which, according to The Book of Mormon, existed in the Americas between 600 B.C. and 421 A.D.) have absolutely no evidence for existing in the America's during the time in question: <br>  <br>  Silk<br>  Steel<br>  Iron<br>  Coins<br>  Donkeys<br>  Cattle, Cow, and Oxen<br>  Pigs<br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon is regarded by some to be nothing more than a story that Joseph Smith constructed in his mind as a boy. In fact, the book History of Joseph Smith (p. 85), written by Joseph Smith's mother, Lucy Mack Smith, states:<br>  <br>  During our evening conversations, Joseph would occasionally give us some of the most amusing recitals that could be imagined. He would describe the ancient inhabitants of this continent, their dress, mode of traveling, and the animals upon which they rode; their cities, their buildings, with every particular; their mode of warfare; and also their religious worship. This he would do with as much ease, seemingly, as if he had spent his whole life among them.<br>  <br>  How is it that Joseph Smith told these stories several years before he allegedly found the golden plates and wrote The Book of Mormon?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiananswers.net/q-cc/cc-archaeology.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiananswers.net/q-cc/cc-...</a><br>  <br>  The Book of Mormon states that there were pre-Columbian peoples that were white, literate, had knowledge of Old World languages, and possessed Old World derived writing systems. (E.g. 1 Nephi 13:23 et. seq.) They smelted metal and made tools and weapons of iron, steel, and brass. (E.g. Ether 7:9, 10:23) They owned domesticated horses and cattle. They possessed chariots. (E.g. Alma 18:9-12) The people covered the "entire land." The civilization described by these passages and scores of others in the Book of Mormon should yield certain types of discoveries in the pre-Colombian archaeological record.[41] The lack of evidence of the Book of Mormon civilizations is problematic for the Book of Mormon. LDS scholars answer that there is a growing body of evidence of the book's authenticity. These evidences, however, are not accepted by mainstream archaeologists.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology_and_the_Book_of_Mormon" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology...</a>|`|b77af9f788ecbbd1984a5e2166b0d0ceaa	Here are few of them.<br>  <br>  1.

But they have to practise the words of God in life.<br>  Now you imagine the percentage of real Christians in this world. <br>  <br>  Now forget about others, try to live in the ways of Jesus did in this world. We are also practising nowadays.|`|51WK9mGvaa	Please read these next few passages from the Gospel of John very carefully, John 6, 47-69:<br>  <br>  47 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."<br>  <br>  52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus‚Äô body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in ‚Äúremembrance‚Äù as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‚Äò Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>   Now is your chance to come home to Jesus‚Äô one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is ‚Äúthe Holy One of God‚Äù and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|g8EViy1Raa	If you're asking what percentage of people who claim to be Christian actually live a wholly Christian life I'd say about 0.000001%<br>  <br>  The rest are liars and hypocrites.|`|a89SGfIaaa	The person let him be of any community if think he is a christian by heart then the percentage calculated by any means for christian will be doubtfull|`|rIvp1BToaa	less than  50 %  but its  not the denomination that counts  but whether  you gave  your life  to christ and live  for him  there  can be  true  christians  from any denomination.<br>  <br>   and many  who are  not in most.|`|2iwOIskRaa	LOL. this made me laugh, i'd say 1%? maybe give a few.|`|yoPNXiluaa	You know that some atheists say that about other atheists.

The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus‚Äô body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in ‚Äúremembrance‚Äù as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‚Äò Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth.<br>  <br>   Now is your chance to come home to Jesus‚Äô one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is ‚Äúthe Holy One of God‚Äù and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|MKWkPH2vaa	Life's what you make it. At the end of the day it just you deciding whether you want to be a happy good person or not.

Today, that relationship with God is only possible through His Son, Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12; John 14:6; John 1:12). Eternal life is gained when one repents of his/her sin (no longer wants to continue in it but wants Christ to change them and make them a new person) and starts relying on Jesus Christ as Savior.<br>  <br>  Real meaning in life is not found merely in finding Jesus as Savior (as wonderful as that is). Rather, real meaning in life is when one begins to follow Christ as His disciple, learning of Him, spending time with Him in His Word, the Bible, communing with Him in prayer, and in walking with Him in obedience to His commands. If you are an unbeliever (or perhaps a new believer) you might be saying to yourself, ‚ÄúThat does not sound very exciting or fulfilling to me!‚Äù But please read on just a little longer. Jesus made the following statements:<br>  <br>  ‚ÄúCome to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light‚Äù (Matthew 11:28-30). ‚ÄúI have come that they may have life, and have it to the full‚Äù (John 10:10b). ‚ÄúIf anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it‚Äù (Matthew 16:24-25). ‚ÄúDelight yourself in the LORD and he will give you the desires of your heart‚Äù (Psalm 37:4).<br>  <br>  What all of these verses are saying is that we have a choice. We can continue to seek to guide our own lives, which results in an empty life, or we can choose to pursue God and His will for our lives with a whole heart, which will result in living life to the full, having the desires of our heart met, and finding contentment and satisfaction. This is so because our Creator loves us and desires the best for us (not necessarily the easiest life, but the most fulfilling).<br>  <br>  The Christian life can be compared to the choice, when attending a sporting event, of whether to purchase the expensive seats that are close to the action, or to pay less and watch the game from a distance. Watching God work ‚Äúfrom the front row‚Äù is what we should choose, but sadly, is not what most people choose. Watching God work firsthand is for whole-hearted disciples of Christ who have truly stopped pursuing their own desires so that they can be pursuing God's purposes. They have paid the price (complete surrender to Christ and His will); they are experiencing life to its fullest; and they can face themselves, their fellow man, and their Maker with no regrets. Have you paid the price? Are you willing to? If so, you will not hunger after meaning or purpose again.|`|RDfOZUgwaa	Being happy. Finding someone special. Reproducing when the time's right.

eolwdtL7aa	Hi. Jesus sums up His teachings in The Great Commandment  (you can find this in the New Testament, in the gospel of Mark: chapter 12<br>  ( also in the other gospels: Matthew 22.34-40; Luke 10.25-28) <br>  <br>  Here is the part of the Great Commandment:<br>  <br>  28 A teacher of the Law was there who heard the discussion. He saw that Jesus had given the Sadducees a good answer, so he came to him with a question: ‚ÄúWhich commandment is the most important of all?‚Äù <br>   29 Jesus replied, ‚ÄúThe most important one is this: ‚ÄòListen, Israel! The Lord our God is the only Lord. The Lord our God is the only Lord; or The Lord is our God, the Lord alone.30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.‚Äô The second most important commandment is this: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as you love yourself.‚Äô There is no other commandment more important than these two.‚Äù <br>  <br>  These are the key teachings of Jesus.<br>  <br>  But also very important in His teaching is his Sermon on the Mount.<br>  Read Matthew chapters 5,6,7. Those are beautiful and powerful words.<br>  I have included the link, to and online bible.<br>  <br>  I hope the words of Jesus will touch your heart, as they have done mine.

No other ‚Äúreligious founder‚Äù was God become man (John 1:1,14) ‚Äì the only way an infinite debt could be paid. Jesus had to be God so that He could pay our debt. Jesus had to be man so He could die.

I'm about to tell you something really private and personal that I have been struggling with. I tryed to suppress it, but I now know that I have no romantic feelings to women whatso ever. I'm gay. We can only be friends. I hope you understand and I'm sorry if I hurted you.<br>  And just leave it at this and wait to see what she says. she might think its a joke.. or might feel that she's been used in an experience to test your sexuality, tell her you love her company and would love to stay friends, but she deserves not to be left in the dark and that its not easy for you.|`|QJhf2INnaa	You don't need to tell her you're gay yet. You can break up with her and tell her it's just not working out for you. You can come out later when she's had a chance to calm down and get over your break-up.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to be outed to everybody you know for safety (or any other) reasons, this is the best form of action. After a break-up emotions are running high and things can be said that can't be unsaid.<br>  <br>  Plus, there's a possibility she already suspects and it won't come as a total shock.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Yes, break up with her FIRST before you get involved.  Cheating doesn't begin with kissing or sex.  It often begins with emotional intimacy.  Don't do any of it until you break up with her first.  That is the least you can do and you owe her that much.  You can't help how you feel, but you can help when and how you act on it.  My cousin was engaged to a woman but he knew in his heart that he loved men and he wasn't meant to be with a woman.  He told her that he knew he was gay and they broke up. He just loved her as person and he wanted her to know that she didn't do anything wrong.  Years later they became friends.  He is still gay.  She married a man and they divorced.  Now she is in a lesbian relationship!|`|3cb1b9273ff7534ec3ef0fd97957cdacaa	You could approach him if you wanted to I suppose, but I personally think it's a mistake to just go chasing after the first gay guy you see after you finally start being openly gay.  There are lots of gay guys out there so find one that is the kind of guy you are looking for.

My psychological interpretation is derived from having some of my own dreams "interpreted" for me.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are in a repeated situation in your conscious life that is stifling you.  You are feeling powerless to overcome this.  You are trying to talk or reason it out but the situation (perhaps another person) will not respond to talk or reason.<br>  <br>  As far as seeing what you see around you while you are sleeping, it is possible that you are doing a sort of sleepwalking by keeping your eyes partially open.  This can happen to a person when in extremely stressful times.  You may want to notice if your eyes are dry when you wake up.  That would indicate that your eyes have been partially open while sleeping.|`|xR2wnheVaa	Jay,<br>  <br>  I too have had similar experiences, not for quite a while though and I'm not sure why.<br>  <br>  I sometimes listen to "Ask the Pastor" as I work. He spoke to a caller about this and his instruction was something toward speaking words over what's going on. Our words have power. God spoke things into existance. Our words are not to be idle. We should be slow to speak, think about what we say before we let them loose, they can be a great fire. They can be healing too, a cool drink of water.<br>  <br>  I think you can ask him on line too if you like.

First question, then believe.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	some of the harm caused by belief in gods:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Crusades.<br>  The Inquisition.<br>  Witch trials in Europe and America.<br>  The Divine right of Kings (valid until killed by another Divinely-appointed King).<br>  Missionaries destroying/converting smaller, "heathen" religions and cultures.<br>  Missionaries such as Mother Teresa.<br>  The demonization of other religions, e.g. Christianity demonizing Pagans ("They're devil-worshippers!"), the Romans demonizing Christians ("They're atheists and cannibals!").<br>  Persecution of Heretics - e.g. Galileo for daring to suggest that the Earth orbits the Sun.<br>  Children dying because their parents refused them medical treatment on religious grounds; relying instead on faith-healers and prayer.<br>  Slavery, supposedly supported by scripture ("Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, just as you would obey Christ.", St.Paul, Ephesians 6:5)<br>  Holy wars - followers of different faiths (or even the same faith) killing each other in the name of their (benevolent, loving and merciful) gods.<br>  The destruction of great works of art considered to be pornographic/blasphemous, and the persecution of the artists.<br>  Censorship (often destructive) of speech, art, books, music, films, poetry, songs and, if possible, thought.<br>  Persecution/punishment of blasphemers (Salman Rushdie still has a death sentence on him), and blasphemy laws in general.<br>  The requirement of theism in order to stand for public office or to testify in court.<br>  Serial killers believing they are doing the work of Satan (or sometimes Jesus).<br>  Often-fatal exorcisms by priests believing they are destroying the work of Satan.<br>  People suffering dreadful injury or death in the belief that their faith has made them invulnerable (e.g. people climbing into lion enclosures at zoos, with a Bible as protection).<br>  Whole societies divided by minor differences in belief or doctrine, often resulting in violence.<br>  Mass suicides of cult-members following a charismatic leader who believes the world is about to End<br>  The attempted genocide of followers of a particular faith (e.g. the Jewish Holocaust, "ethnic cleansing" in former Yugoslavia).<br>  Blood sacrifices to appease the Gods, or to ensure a good harvest. (The Aztecs made daily human sacrifices to ensure that the Sun would rise. Or did they? )<br>  The practice of "female circumcision" (more accurately termed genital mutilation).<br>  The discouragement of rational, critical thought (resulting in young-earth creationists, for example).<br>  Uncontrolled population growth caused (or at least helped) by churches prohibiting birth-control and abortion. (You can also add : unwanted pregnancies, ill-fated forced marriages, and pregnant teenagers condemned to a life in mental institutions to avoid embarrassing their families.)<br>  The spread of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. AIDS) due to churches prohibiting the use of condoms.<br>  Believers whipping, impaling, poisoning or crucifying themselves during religious festivals as a demonstration of their faith and piety.<br>  Suicide bombers taught to believe that martyrs go straight to Paradise.<br>  The indoctrination of children into the religion of their parents, giving them an arbitrary, life-long belief that is almost entirely dependent on their place of birth.<br>  Women treated as second-class citizens or even slaves<br>  Pentecostal snake-handlers<br>  Persecution of homosexuals<br>  Abuse of power, authority and trust by religious leaders (for financial gain or sexual abuse of followers and even children).|`|MeFeazFiaa	Definitely!

8cTkYTQXaa	I was born in 1956 and I was a 70s wanna be hippie. I really took it to the extreme. I went to a seldom heard of concert called August Jam. It was at the Charlotte motor speedway August 2, 1973. There were at least 250,000 paying audience members. The Allman Brothers, J Giles, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Black Oak Arkansas, Marshall Tucker, Foghat, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Kansas, Johnny Winter were among the groups that were there. The Allman Brothers played last and they should have played before Emerson Lake and Palmer. ELP took the show with their Karn Evil 9 trilogy...<br>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeQsZOQqO6I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UeQsZOQqO...</a><br>  Check that out. When the Allman Brothers took the stage, the sound system was shattered. They are great to this day, but that day they just were out rocked. I could not believe how slow they sounded after ELP.  Emerson did his flying piano show where he starts spinning around then tilts up and spins backward while playing the hell out of it. It was a real trip. The fans that did not get tickets broke down the fences and I think there were over 500,000 there. It got really crowded in the parking lot with all those people before they broke down the fences. They set portalets on fire and turned them over. What a mess. There was open drug use and the dealers had signs on their vehicles of their products...That was scary because the people got too high. There was an announcement about some match head THC...but it was PCP and lots of people over dosed. That was the bad side though. There was enough good things happening to overshadow the criminals, but I had to keep my head about me.<br>  I still listen to some of the music to this day. I was only 16 then and I left home without permission for the first time that weekend. I had just got paid and had a pocket full of money. One of the guys that rode with me talked me out of carrying my keys and he took them. We got separated and I could not find him anywhere. I finally went hitch hiking for the first time after the concert. I lived 60 miles away and I got a ride from two girls. I was so nervous but they put me at ease and we had a great time. They took me to the guy's home and I got the keys from him. They told me to follow them to their home and we partied for a couple of days. I missed work and got fired even though my dad was the personnel manager of the plant where I worked. I really had a great time. That is all I can talk about without violating the rules. LOL<br>  <br>  I cannot find any of the footage from that concert, but at the time it was the biggest show since Woodstock.  My friends that went with me seemed so close then. One passed away with some illness of 15 years, the other guy is now a lawyer....<br>  If you want to really get into that life back then look up the Fiddler's Convention at Union Grove North Carolina. That was shut down from pressure from the FBI and other law enforcement groups in 1978 or 9...That is another story for sure....|`|AA11010672	Loved the music but i was away most of the 60s in Navy so enjoyed the sambas of Brazil instead , have to admit i was amazed how England had changed ,while i was away ,like coming back to  a different country .<br>  Malta had the music , but not the festivals.|`|ARAlgdnHaa	in 1969 i was 10 years old so by the early 70's i was still influenced by the music and fashion, stones, jimi hendrix, humble pie, traffic, etc.<br>  <br>  i saw the stones, jethro tull, and other bands later on...but i would've loved to see janis joplin- the best all-out female artist  and jimi (a.k.a. ahead of his time...a master of the guitar)|`|khJBfboRaa	I went to see Woodstock at the cinema and I did like Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix et al, at the time.  However, I was a UK mod (original) - soul music, Vespa scooters, Small Faces, long leather coats and attitude.  Hey, happy days|`|xjXwsBRwaa	I was born in 1966 so i was to young for the hippies' revolution of the 1960's, however i feel like i have the hippie spirit now, without the drug usage....the song "old hippie" by the Bellamy Brothers says it all!|`|LcURWscBaa	I was too young to go to Woodstock, but I remember it, and I love movies about that era, such as A Walk On The Moon.  When they get the music, clothes, cars, etc. right, it takes me right back there.|`|GoKPZp1kaa	yeah i went to Woodstock & the Isle of Wight Festival. they were immense. i still listen to some good old bands that were from the 60's now...how can you not?|`|v0FgA15Gaa	I turned 13 in 1969, so I just caught the end.  Set me up for the great 70s though.|`|61fcf832e5d4b87f1c941578ef4bacd3aa	I was...... to a point.

Too many people, rain, mud, etc.<br>  I have a CD full of my music besides what I have in the cpu. I listen all the time. . . Some of my music is. . Beatles. Queen, Doors, Eagles, CSN&Y, Paul Simon (Kathy's Song is my fav), Dylan,Zeppelin, Hendrix (my fav) Greatful D, Monkey's, Stones, BS&T ("You've Made Me So Very Happy" ), Guns'n'Roses, Pink Floyd, Joplin, Simon and Garfunkel, Talking Heads (Then She Was ). . . I could go on and on. . . . I love music !!!!|`|G4vFjh0yaa	Yes we were at Woodstock.<br>  I still listen to Jethro Tull and Janis Joplin and a few others. Mostly on You Tube now though. (We never thought we would be doing that).<br>  <br>  We were just talking about this the other day. How silly we were and what a statement we felt we were making.<br>  We tend to forget what a mess it was there.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	Not me.  I was to busy working and raising small children as a single mother.  I saw them on TV.  It sure didn't interest me.  Drinking, drugging and careless sex wasn't appealing.  They didn't look very clean either.|`|aXYiOskmaa	i was a hippie in training. being born in "60 to traditional parents, i could only pretend. however, my brother was a bit of a hippie. not the haight-ashbury type but a hippie none the less.|`|GI27dKIkaa	I wasn't old enough !  I was born in 1962 !|`|4SF4KGu4aa	I was old enough but lived in a small rural town in northern Illinois. We "posed" as hippies or something like " Hippie Lite". Had long hair and the big sideburns etc. but really were pretty conservative. <br>  <br>  As far as I knew, Woodstock was a small town in northern Illinois about 90 miles from my home. Didn't know it was in NY state until I was in college and I felt I didn't miss anything.<br>  <br>  Did see the Beachboys in concert in Joliet around 1973 and their new opener was Bachman-Turner Overdrive.<br>  <br>  Among my friends and contemporaries, it was pretty much just beer and wine. Budweiser long neck that needed a church key and 100 proof Southern Comfort for guys. Sloe Gin and Ripple and Bali high wine for girls. Had to have the Marlboro smokes also.<br>  <br>  57 Chevy's were still driven by gear heads and some even had vettes. Many had mid 50's pickups or used mom and dads car. I am more of a fan of the Beach Boys, Four Seasons , Roy Orbison and some of the other ballad/crooner type music.|`|DJLeObm4aa	Yes I was a 60's Hippie but could never have afford to go from Scotland to Isle of Wight. Did however have the long hair, beads, outlandish long skirts, Jesus sandals and right in to Flower Power and Banning the Bomb. Often sat around open grassy areas in a big crowd on a summer's night with the guitar singing all the peace songs  etc......Won't say what the etc was LOL!|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I was 14 at the end of the sixties and from a rural area so the closest I got to a hippie was on TV.  I have found later that as in most groups it is easier to just lump them all together as one give it a name.  People are individuals just can't be whatever you want to call them without knowing them.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I wasn‚Äôt a hippie in the political sense, but I was doing my own thing, which wasn‚Äôt much.  I let my hair grow, went to school, wrote poetry and arted.<br>  <br>  The Woodstock event passed me by. I was working in a gas station and people were stopping by to get gassed up to drive to the event. I was invited to ride along, but I declined. I didn‚Äôt want to leave my dog ‚ÄòPoo‚Äô home alone. Plus I had no money.  I really wasn‚Äôt in the drug scene that much. The strongest substance I ever used was weed and I didn‚Äôt like that very much. I preferred beer or hard liquor.<br>  <br>  I liked classical music and the Beatles. I will listen to either one today.|`|AA12185428	I surely love the music of that era, listen to it sometimes now , adopted some of the fashion style, but I wasn't a hippie. Just more of a traditional type person I guess. Not everyone in the 60's was high.|`|fd7f7760fab598ddb7f5fd26f811c2baaa	I wouldn't go to the Festivals but I do sometimes listen to the music.

FHtbvdvBaa	I find studies about this supposed "Gay Gene" stupid. As long as you're happy with the way you are then that's all that really matters.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	the argument is whether it is nature or nurture. it seems a bit unusual to have so many come out of the closet . makes me wonder just how much is it vogue, result of molestation or natural. I personally know some of both. The origins of surveys are what you need to know before you take them for fact.|`|272aa91fee0690c497ce8d228459dc94aa	Hun, hate to say it, but girls ARE a lot more likely to be "Party Gays" It's okay for a couple of drunk girls, or just girls who feel like teasing boys to make out. This is NEVER acceptable to men. You kiss a guy once, you're gay. End of story. So a man will never willingly choose to kiss another man. Ever. Unless he's gay. Girls have the option to do it if they just particularly feel like it at that moment in time. No, it's not fair, but no one ever said the world was.|`|So1ROzM4aa	Chosen, born, who cares? You are what you are!<br>  <br>  EDIT: If people knew for a fact that being gay was genetic, they would still hate you. They would say 'the evil is in their genes, they will never have salvation'. People would probably abort their babies if genetic screening became the norm and the 'gay gene' showed up. Bigots are bigots, proving gayness to be genetic or a lifestyle choice won't change their minds.|`|4xioUjWuaa	It's just saying that women are more fluid when it comes to attraction|`|cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	there  is  a  lot  of  bunk  out there  posing  as  science<br>  <br>  i  have  one  older  brother  and  i  am  gay.  my  younger  brother  has  two  older  brothers  and  he  could  not be  any  more  straight.<br>  <br>  <br>  as for  animals (chimps or  otherwise) i  can  see that  people  seeing  the  sexual  act  would  be  aroused  by the  mere  suggestion  of sex.  seeing  it  in  any form  may  well enhance  that suggestion.<br>  <br>  as  for  girls choosing  thats  just  apples  and  oranges.  gay  men  versus  bi women.  thats  bad  science.<br>  <br>  if  you  are  gay  you  have  no  hetero  urges.  if  your straight  you  have  no  gay  urges and  if  youre  bisexual you  have  both  and  a  choice  presents  itself.  this is  true  for  males  and  females  alike
PTBWRnBlaa	The one that most successfully quashed the humanity in it's followers.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Almost certainly Jainism. Devout Jinas will often carry a broom. sweeping in front of themselves, lest they inadvertently step on a bug.<br>  <br>  Jainism traces its roots to a succession of 24 Jinas ("those who overcome", or conqueror) in ancient East India. The first Jina is traditionally believed to have been a giant who lived 8.4 million years ago. The most recent and last Jina was Vardhamana (a.k.a. Mahavira, "The Great Hero") He was born in 550 BCE) and was the founder of the Jain community. He attained enlightenment after 13 years of deprivation. In 420 BCE, he committed the act of salekhana which is fasting to death. Each Jina has "conquered love and hate, pleasure and pain, attachment and aversion, and has thereby freed `his' soul from the karmas obscuring knowledge, perception, truth, and ability..."<br>  <br>  Jainism is a syncretistic religion, which contains many elements similar to Hinduism and Buddhism. The world's almost 4 million Jains are almost entirely located in India. There are about 1,410 in Canada (1991 census).|`|sVyH0jTiaa	I am going to say this to you, Jehovah's Witnesses don't believe in war or killing because we do what our God told us to live with all the love not to be enemies.|`|BBVfRheyaa	Unknown and private religions.|`|MeFeazFiaa	The religion of no religion.<br>  <br>  All religions are hostile to each other and even the cults within religious groups hate each other enough  to the extent of wanting to kill the competition.<br>  <br>  Its all about market share and money in the end.|`|AA10671142	Jehovah Witnesses we do not go to war and kill anyone. we love our neighbor as ourselves|`|332vXA6oaa	Jehovah's Witnesses and Jesus go hand in hand.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Probably Bahai'ism or the Amish or something?

8765ea9ad82eb11dbeae3ab65abec135aa	Because being a Christian in the proper, Biblical sense of the word really, really sucks. Don't take my word for it - read the Bible. Women have no part to play in society. None at all. Stay at home, cook, clean the house, do as your husband tells you, have babies and keep your mouth shut. Homosexuals are to be tortured to death. Don't ever protest about your lot or do anything out of the ordinary to improve your lives - 'The meek shall inherit the Earth', 'The love of money is the root of all evil', 'It is easier for a rich man to pass through the eye of a needle than to enter the Kingdom of Heaven' and all that; in other words wealth and the pursuit of wealth is evil and it is far better to be pious and eat mud than it is to demand a better deal from life - or work towards it. Marx was (for once) right - 'Religion is the opiate of the people'. Keep 'em quiet and obedient, just the way we like our slaves to be. Tell 'em what they want to hear - living in unspeakable, grinding poverty is perfectly acceptable because paradise awaits you at the end of your short, miserable life.  Religion has been used in this way for centuries, squashing flat anything that threatened to improve the lives of ordinary people and make them realise that the vast concentration of wealth held by the Church could be used for better purposes than buying the bishop a new palace. By corollary ordinary people have to be told that not only is there a wonderful reward waiting for them in exchange for living in economic slavery for their entire lives, they have to be convinced that there is a terrible punishment if they attempt to do anything about it, hence the concept of Hell and eternal damnation, probably the most unchristian idea ever promulgated.  <br>  <br>  Like I said, don't take my word for it. Simply read the history of religion - applied, not theoretical religion - and have a think about what the world would be like if we hadn't had those particular millstones around our necks for two thousand years.|`|pUIsx4Vsaa	I believe in reincarnation so if we do not get it right we get another chance.  <br>  <br>  I think some people believe that our own creative thoughts and beliefs help create the conditions we manifest in between incarnations.<br>  <br>  If we do not believe in God and have closed our mind to such things then some people think that stops us experiencing God.

GItBUBL9aa	In it's truest sense it must be analytical if there are true rights and wrongs.  If morals are dependent on what a particular group determines is moral, then it's both analysis and emotion.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	At the core it's instinctive. Instinct expresses itself via emotions that produce a drive in a direction. Finding the exact path requires intelligent analysis.<br>  <br>  Driving down a lonely road you see a women in a stalled car.

It's instinctual.<br>  <br>  Mammals are social creatures who raise their young to adulthood. It is necessary for us to get along with each other.<br>  <br>  All mammals have morals. They feel attachments to others, protect those they love, and sacrifice for the group.<br>  <br>  We have mirror neurons in our brains which "put us in their shoes." Our affections direct our judgment.<br>  <br>  Obviously, like any other trait, some people are more strongly bound to their morals than others. That is to be expected. But all mammals have morals.|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	If your worldview is limited by the dichotomy of the intellect and the emotions, then morality will be very difficult not only to conceive of, but to find a reliable foundation of. <br>  <br>  If there is no heart/soul of a person, then ethics are irrelevant, unreliable, and a tool of power. <br>  <br>  If there is a heart/soul, then something higher (yes, like God), ingrained a similar sense for morality.|`|MEny7pBHaa	it is neither. i would say it is more analytical though than emotional. it comes about like an emotion but is instilled through discernment. morality is more like wisdom, it comes from experience. people have different experiences, that is why morality variates so much.|`|COWsSguVaa	it's analytically emotional|`|xelkbdbdaa	It is both. Now, as a Christian, I prefer to avoid situational ethics. But, thinking with my mind instead of with my heart is usually a more fair way to assess things. Thinking about morality from an emotional position only often leads into favoritism and sympathy for immoral causes.|`|9DW9irIGaa	i dont trust emotions to guide me. the bible even calls the heart "deceitful and desperately wicked", and anyone can deem their actions right or wrong based on what their "heart" tells them. however, i think there is absolute truth written into our minds/instincts. everyone would agree, for instance, that something is wrong if it hurts another person, like murder. yet sometimes we must be analytical of ourselves and our emotions, and straighten out what is our own comfortable "heart" telling us versus what we know to be true if we hush the "wants" in us. ...did that make any sense? i'm tired...:) it made sense in my mind.

Since his father died before his birth and his mother died shortly thereafter, he was raised by his uncle who was from the respected tribe of Quraysh. He was raised illiterate, unable to read or write, and remained so till his death. His people, before his mission as a prophet, were ignorant of science and most of them were illiterate.<br>  <br>  As he grew up, he became known to be truthful, honest, trustworthy, generous and sincere. He was so trustworthy that they called him the Trustworthy! Muhammad (Saw) was very religious, and he long detested the decadence and idolatry of his society.<br>  <br>  Muhammad (Saw) was growing up in the affectionate care of his uncle, Abu Talib, when at the age of twelve he accompanied him on a business trip to Ash-Sham. When their caravan reached Busra in Ash-Sham, a Christian monk called Bahra invited to dinner. Abu Talib and his caravan had passed this way many times before but have never been asked in by the monk. All members of the caravan went to dinner except Muhammad (Saw) who stayed behind, probably to look after the camels and their baggage. Bahra insisted on Muhammad‚Äôs (Saw) joining in the dinner. When he did, Bahra asked him a few questions, and Muhammad (Saw) answered precisely and to the point.<br>  <br>  When Bahra heard the answers given by Muhammad (Saw), he recognised that Muhammad (Saw) was going to be a prophet in the future. His advice to Abu Talib was to take special care of his nephew. When they finished their trading, Abu Talib lost no time in returning to Makah with Muhammad (Saw).<br>  <br>  <br>  At the age of forty, Muhammad (Saw) received his first revelation from Allah (Swt) through the Angel Gabriel. The revelations continued for twenty three years, and they are collectively known as the Qur‚Äôan.<br>  <br>  As soon as he began to recite the Qur‚Äôan and to preach the truth which God had revealed to him, he and his small group of followers suffered persecution from unbelievers. The persecution grew so fierce that in the year 622 Allah (Swt) gave them the command to emigrate. This emigration from Makah to the city of Medina, some 260 miles to the north, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.<br>  <br>  After several years, Muhammad (Saw) and his followers were able to return to Makah, where they forgave their foes.|`|AA10736671	Muslims actually believe & worship the one God of their ancestor Noah & Adam (since those 2 men are the fathers of all living humans). The Quran clearly praises Abraham for disbelieving in the divinity of the moon & believing only in the one true God. The Quran is also clearly instructing people not to kneel to the sun or moon, but the real God who created every thing.<br>  <br>  It‚Äôs one evangelist with bad reputation, who created the myth of Muslims worshiping a moon God. His name is Robert Morey. He had once cheated on the company that sponsor him, where he used them to make money & refuse to embers them. Morey is also known for his hatred towered other groups, including some Christians. A Jewish gentleman by the name of Michael Hoffman challenged Morey once for a debate, but he ran away. Additionally Muslims had already refuted Morey‚Äôs claims & found many holes in his argument. Clearly there‚Äôs no rational reason for believing that moon God myth about the Muslims.

5515fbe4bde3824ce5a0d6e4b8fde157aa	I slept with a Greek chick once... not quite what you were asking but...<br>  <br>  She was cool, funny, and extremely family oriented. After our one night stand she wanted me to go hang out with her family for the day. I made up an excuse why I couldn't go so I never got to meet them but if they were as sweet as the woman I met at the bar then they had to be very kind people indeed.<br>  <br>  I say go for it - worst that could happen is you're not happy. Just skadoodle out of there if that happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
lQIKWXDuaa	This is a tough one for me. I am going to give it my best shot. The first question that I have is who are the Pharisee? Was Jesus a Pharisee? Its seems that Jesus was not a Pharisee. The Pharisee and John's disciples fasted because that was their tradition, their custom and this was not that of Jesus Christ or of his disciples.  This is why Jesus said if you were a guess in mourning at a wedding, would you ruin the bride grooms happy moment with your sorrow or would you wait until they left to mourn. <br>  It seems that in the presence of his guess, Jesus and disciple do not fast?? I am  confused here. I am trying to the connect the two. Does anybody if she Jesus and his disciple use to fast? If so that would mean that Jesus and his disciples reserves their fasting rituals when they are not entertaining guest.<br>  <br>  I think Barney is right, he was talking about his death. It seems like they did not want to mourn in Jesus' presents, they wanted to wait after he was gone to mourn.<br>  They wanted to preserve their memory as is. They wanted to enjoy the few time that Jesus had with them. They will have plenty of time to mourn later. Now it makes sense.<br>  <br>  "Neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved." In this verse, he is saying that if they mourn now the moment would be ruin. They are preserving the moment by doing something other than staying around and mourn.<br>  <br>  Thank you, I learn something today. Have a great day!!!<br>  ss|`|AA12360689	Yes, Jesus was talking about the time he would not be with his disciples here on earth.  There was no reason for sadness while he was with them, hence no reason to fast.|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	Jesus is giving a foretaste of what Paul would preach later: that the time of Mosaic law has ended; that with the coming of the messiah and the kingdom of heaven, there is a new law; that with the new law, there is a new covenant.  And the two are not very compatible.  This is the meaning of verses 16 and 17.  <br>  <br>  The new law and new covenant do not mean there will never again be suffering or sorrow, nor do they mean that humankind will no longer have reason to fast or no longer have cause to repent misdeeds.   But it will all have a new form.    <br>  <br>  See also Jeremiah 31:31-34.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Fasting is an initiation done to commune with God as Jesus did in the desert. But when we commune with others, we want to have our attention on each other so all can enjoy the occasion. This was the time for fellowship. Later would come time for solitude as Paul spent time in the desert as well.<br>  <br>  We can only know what is God's will for us to do by living in the present, not by looking to the past for old practices and rules. The wine, Spirit cannot be contained and used this way and our light is lost if we don't listen to God in the moment.
97031ab5ff9bcf387a9d1278f60ddafeaa	Let's go to your questions 1 by 1.<br>  <br>  Could these verses mean it is a good thing for Christians to mix with sinners ?<br>  <br>  Read verse 10 again. The "sinners" came to Jesus. They had apparently heard of his teachings and desired to learn much more.<br>  <br>  Why where tax collectors put in the same class as sinners ?<br>  <br>  All of us are sinners. But just like today, tax collectors are especially unpopular.<br>  <br>  What do you think Jesus meant in verse 13 when he said " 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' ?<br>  <br>  The Jewish leaders had added such a burden by distorting God's laws. <br>  <br>  (Matthew 23:23-24) .?.?.Woe to YOU, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because YOU give the tenth of the mint and the dill and the cumin, but YOU have disregarded the weightier matters of the Law, namely, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These things it was binding to do, yet not to disregard the other things. 24?Blind guides, who strain out the gnat but gulp down the camel!<br>  <br>  (1 Samuel 15:22) .?.?.Look! To obey is better than a sacrifice.?.?.|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	Jesus was wanting people to change their ways...Its no good " preaching to the converted".<br>  Jesus was preaching to those...WHO IN THE FUTURE, USING THEIR GOD GIVEN FREE WILL...CONVERT THEMSELVES...<br>  It cannot be forced.<br>  The Jewish leaders of Jesus' day would have nothing to do with the Jewish men who were tax collectors for the Romans, whop actually ruled Jerusalem...King Herod was a Jewish King but a Roman "puppet".<br>  The power was held by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate.|`|F4Wu6JXyaa	Other answers have been sufficiently accurate.  But a couple of points to add: by 'sinners' the Pharisees mean any who do not follow strictly the Mosaic law, and sometimes meant as well any who do not follow the all the extra regulations that the Pharisees had, over time, used to hedge Mosaic law. <br>  <br>  What Jesus quotes, from Hosea 6, is echoed in Amos and Isaiah.  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I wanted to add: also see Isaiah 1:11-18.  Note: that particular translation of 'mercy' in Hosea 6 is disputed.  The KJV and bibles descended from it use 'mercy'; more literal translations use 'steadfast love', 'faithful love', 'loyalty', 'loving-kindness' or 'kindness.'   Isaiah and Amos, speaking on this subject, say that the Lord desires justice.|`|MeFeazFiaa	Do not know.  Do not care.<br>  The buy bull is a work of fiction, a book compiled from the plagiarised texts of ancient religions by bronze age sheep herders; translated from Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek texts to Latin and edited by the Catholic Church, translated into English and re-edited by the Church of England as instructed by King James to conform with his views, and interpreted to suit whatever claim is being made regarding its <br>  authenticity.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	Tax collectors at that time were usually very dishonest, taking more money than they were supposed to and pocketing the extra. They were usually despised by the public.<br>  <br>  It is true that Christians should not avoid sinners. How can we ever reach out to people if they have the impression that we think we are "better" than everyone else?|`|p0bB4nW1aa	The tax collectors were known to pocket some of the taxes they collected, and they were allowed to collect these 'taxes' by force if necessary. That is why they were seen as sinners, and those who you shouldn't mix with.<br>  <br>  Jesus put himself amongst the sinners to teach them and show them the truth. <br>  <br>  We too should call out to 'sinners,' not to embrace their lifestlye, but to bring them closer to God.|`|CyOkBzmxaa	What Jesus is talking about is "Redemptive Interaction" which is contrasted against both isolationism or immersion.<br>  <br>  This interaction has at its heart the desire to see one restored to fellowship - if they have been saved and have fallen by the wayside or to be reconciled to God - if they have never been saved.|`|6efc7914882e276da633d0b665fce99baa	1. We are to be salt to the world.  To shine the light of the Lord or word to the world, therefor we should not separate ourselves from the world, but be a part of it while not bringing ourselves to accept the world as good. 2.  Tax collectors at that time where not known for having high moral character, often despised by there own country men as a type of traitor.   3.  Mercy is the heart of the Lords message, for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believer on him may have everlasting life.  We in and of ourselves cannot offer a sacrifice that would satisfy the Lord our sin is to great and we are born into it.|`|8RRlokvhaa	The fact that we're christians tell us from the verses that we were sick but now, we're healthy bc of Jesus. We are sinners like everyone else, perhaps even worse than others. Tis the reason Christ came to us. <br>  <br>  Tax collectors in those days used to take bribes, keep part of the collection to themselves. Sin. Society knew this and they had a label as 'sinners' as compared to the Pharisees who were teachers of the law, who saw themselves as a cut above the rest of society. Therefore, they became unteachable cos of pride. Whereas when one realizes one is a 'sinner', one is prepared to learn and be taught. <br>  <br>  Thus, christians ARE sinners albeit repentant ones. Let's not forget this. As to socializing with sinners whom u think are below you, that is personal preference.<br>  <br>  'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' ... meaning God wants people to be kind to others rather than 'offering sacrifice' as in religiosity.|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	I think it shows that it can be a good thing to mix with sinners who have an open heart to being healed. <br>  <br>  A tax collector was seen as a sinner because they were generally known to lie about the taxes they collected and keep the extra themselves, and no one could do anything about it because they were employed by the roman government. <br>  <br>  Verse 13 is a quote from Hosea 6:6<br>  "For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt offerings."<br>  Jesus said this this remind the Pharisees that the traditions and laws were NOT the point of redemption, rather, it is the mercy and grace.  Therefore, judging the "sinners" does not help them, but offering forgiveness and healing does.|`|9DW9irIGaa	good question!<br>  <br>  depends what you mean by "mix". christians should be "in" the world, not "of" the world... meaning, we shouldn't refuse to befriend anyone who doesn't believe what we do, or completely isolate ourselves (that is a jehovah's witness belief)... on the other hand we should not live like the world; we should set an example and be loving, but speak the truth at the same time.<br>  <br>  2nd, tax collectors were put in the same class as sinners because they were known for being swindlers and cheating people out of more money than they owed (such was the case with zaccheus, whom everyone knew to be stealing money for himself-- one of the other gospels, mark, luke, or john, confirms this, not sure which one).<br>  <br>  3rd, the jews were taught all through the old testament to give sacrifices to God to pay for their sins. Jesus became the "Lamb", the ultimate sacrifice, to end the law of sacrificing. we are made right with God through jesus, not sacrifices. he was saying he wants us to have mercy on others and be loving, help the sick and poor, etc. rather than just go to church and "sacrifice" in a shallow way. basically he wants our hearts to agree with him.<br>  <br>  4th, there are some GREAT stories of jesus' interactions with the worst of sinners... an adulterous samaritan woman by the well, the woman who kissed his feet and poured oil on them (i believe she was a prostitute), etc...<br>  <br>  verse 12 that you quoted is the best!! he came to save people who know they need a savior, not those who think they are already good enough.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Tax collecting by Rome was stealing wealth from the Jews, or so they believed. Jesus taught that God gives us everything we need, regardless. We don't become happy by sacrifice, or giving up something of value,  but by mercy which is giving up grudges of no value.<br>  <br>  We don't give up anything of value by giving it to someone else because we are giving it to ourselves anyway. There is no loss or lack.|`|4hsl2toNaa	Jesus did not seek out the learned, prominent ones,  but those who were unlettered, weak, poor. For  those are the ones seeking him.  The Pharisees did not teach the people, but put themselves above them and sought glory for themselves.  The weak, poor in spirit needed the teachings of Jesus.  Tax collectors were looked down upon as lowly.  All men sin, so mixing cannot be avoided.  To be merciful is to demonstrate a godly attribute.  The Pharisees were not merciful, just seeking self gratification.  Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice,  the Pharisees kept on being haughty, self absorbed so no sacrifice could atone for their actions.  They were even stupid enough to say Jesus' powers were from Satan, not God, even tho they knew better.   They had the scrolls, knowledge.<br>  <br>  Good question,  "Hairy"
D66PbCnYaa	I'm continually striving to get closer.  I've been getting closer.  No matter what I do, I can crawl back in His arms for love and forgiveness.  I love Him now, and He has always loved me.  We're never close enough.  God wants intimacy with all His children.<br>  <br>  April 12th 2008 1am in the morning God talked with me audibly, calling me on my cell phone believe it or not.  He proved that it was Him, for sure. He said "I long for an intimate relationship with you William."<br>  <br>  I've grown a lot closer to God since.<br>  <br>  Two keys He has shown me.<br>  <br>  Love God.  Do you love Him?  Or just when He does something you like, do you worship THAT instead of Him?<br>  <br>  Pray.  Do you pray?  Not recited, known prayers, but from the heart, to God, and ready to listen.<br>  <br>  <br>  One time, when singing to God, I focused intensely on just Him, and the Holy Spirit entered me like in a way never before and never since.  I stifled it, like I shouldn't have, but I felt a "physical spiritual body" I'd describe it as... enter my body.  It went to my heart, and "sleeves" around my heart dropped off.   I could feel them fall.  I looked at the others in the room, and though I knew He was looking from within me too, and desiring to use me somehow (I could feel the love God had for me and everyone there... it was the most amazing and deep love ever.  If you have never experienced the love of God through Jesus, you are completely missing out!).... well I didn't want to get out of my comfort zone, so I stopped it.  I resisted, and He left me.<br>  <br>  But, I've had many experiences with God.  Just in reading the bible you get close  to God.<br>  <br>  And, prayer especially.  Combine them.  Pray the psalms.  Get creative in your worship.  Worship God the way you feel Him telling you to worship Him... in the way He designed you.<br>  <br>  Without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God.<br>  If you haven't accepted Jesus as your savior, the wrath of God still remains on you.  (Sin is not tolerated.  Jesus died for our sins, but we must accept His death for us.  Its a totally free gift.  We offer ourselves to Him, He offers ETERNITY to us, and our true self back.  It is AMAZING, and totally more than we deserve.)<br>  <br>  Who do you think was worth more?  You, or the SON of God?  Me?  Or God's ONLY Son?  The WHOLE WORLD, the WHOLE UNIVERSE, or God... THE God's, ... ONLY Son.  <br>  <br>  For God so loved the world, that HE GAVE.. His ONLY Begotten SON.... that Whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>  <br>  WOW.<br>  <br>  That is LOVE.  <br>  <br>  And, believe it or not, it is true.  Your lack of belief affects your destiny, not what is.  <br>  <br>  So the question is, how can you ever be close enough to our God?|`|AA11164665	Sometimes I feel close to God, sometimes I feel more distant. I would prefer to have the close feeling all the time, and I believe that He is always there but sometimes I turn away from Him and do my own thing. <br>  <br>  So do I find myself close enough to God, yes most of the time. <br>  <br>  Do I feel that I am always who God wants me to be - no.<br>  <br>  But then that's the joy of being forgiven when you're sorry.|`|CXAKpeH3aa	I find myself not close enough.

AA11028028	Yes I have known for a very long time that babies and kids up to ten or so can, or could possibly see spirits.<br>  Kids don't know the natural and social laws that govern what we see and how we perceive. So they just see what they see. So they see spirits: Guardian spirits, "angels" and all kinds of things most people believe is just childish make believe.<br>  How or why they can see it I am not sure. I died when I was born so I still see ghostly images and entities and such. I kinda wish I didn't because it's not an easy thing to be imbetween if you get me.<br>  Animals can sometimes see it too, Since they are not govened by the same laws we are.

P544Sbmqaa	I think that its a result of supply and demand.  Before when prices were high, there was demand.  People were going to buy it no matter what price.  Kinda like alcohol and tobacco.  People are ALWAYS gonna buy their beer and cigs no matter how much it costs.  I laugh at the people who Ive known who said they were gonna quit at 3 a pack, then 4 a pack, then 5 a pack, and guess what, prices dont matter on those things.  Well, for a long time, gas was the same way.  Even though it is not a necessity to use as much oil/gas as most of us do, we were all gonna keep getting it.  Had the economy been in better shape, prices would still be that high.<br>  <br>  What broke the camels back, however, is that the economy is bad.  We dont have all the extra money, which means somewhere, somehow, people HAVE to reduce their spending.  When prices began to drop, American were buying less oil/gas than we had in decades.  Basically, what happened is the oil companies realized that we had hit a ceiling with what we were going to spend in comparison to the shape of the economy.  The only way to keep us using the same levels of oil/gas was to drop prices.  <br>  <br>  I hated the high oil prices, but can we really blame the oil companies for living the American Dream?  They found a niche with a product they could provide, created demand, and made money.  Should we really punish the companies living the American Dream for our own irresponsible use of their product?  <br>  <br>  Right now, Im more irked about the wasting of gov funds by these companies receiving bail out funds.|`|ZZ4tkytYaa	It's 7.25 per gal. here.. who's panicking?|`|vtEGNdADaa	Not interesting but depressing.

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English.

Because there are many kinds of devotion.<br>  But if you desire the true one for the Supreme Creator, His messenger---The Holy Spirit--- will guide you, i.e. if you so desired and ask His help, or try to understand the life of Jesus Christ--as written in the Holy Scriptures--the claimed "Son of God" who came down on earth, who established the clear path/kind of true devotion to the Almighty Father for all of us to be saved and go back to Him.<br>  other purpose from this...are all blind, you will be in danger, and just destroy your precious beautiful spirit. <br>  Other than God savings purpose, Love, happy, joy, peace, constructive help to one another.....evil destroys your life, spirits and snatch you from..... everlasting happiness with God.|`|0e7f976c21fbed225a821d9760defb2eaa	Not with me, knowledge builds faith.

8b4618e02e1bdccbc59fb864e2448e1caa	i am a muslim, and you are allowed to date, the major factor is that the religion of islam tends to be more on the vague side, allowing poeple to interpret and practice in whatever way they feel is right in their hearts.  the problem with the mulsims over seas is that they tend to read the koran (holy book similar to bible and christianity) and read every word literally and are unwilling to change with time.  overall it is the basic meaning of the koran that should be sought after, not the word for word exact definition.  i hope this was clear and gives you a little more insight.|`|AA11666050	I'm a Muslim, and truthfully, we're not supposed to date...AT ALL!!!!!!!

You want to make sure everything is just fine, but you have no way of knowing if it really is or not and that is sort of a scary thing. Maybe that's not what it is with you, but eh. Just a guess. :]<br>  <br>  Try some stress relieving exercises. Meditation, yoga... even just plain old jogging and stuff can take your mind off stress. And if you're right and all this is from some blood sugar thing, then you should see a doctor about it-- they might be able to help.

Q5oAIL5Vaa	No. I hate snorers. Tell her to go to the doctor, and get herself sorted. It's not being mean if you have to spend the whole night listening to someone grunting and groaning like a freight train all night. Especially when you have work. If she doesn't get it sorted and it bothers you a lot it will gradually ruin your relationship. You'll stop inviting her over or make excuses not to sleep over to escape the noise, and she'll start complaining (snorers are always very defensive and claim the don't snore) which'll make it worse yadda yadda yaa....<br>  <br>  As for the bed covers, maybe you could get a bigger cover? For example if you had a double bed, get a king size bed cover.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps as i feel your pain and know the anger that snoring causes.

It doesn't matter who the father is whether they're in prison or not or whether they actually want to raise the child. It worries me that having a baby seems to be the main ambition for these girls. Something is failing somehwere if they don't have any other goal in life other than getting knocked up then probably having to go on Jeremy Kyle for a DNA test. Its terrible and I normally one baby isn't enough - they go on to have 2 or 3 or more, probably by different dads and the first dad is long gone. Best thing about it is, if they have another baby they get given more money in benefits and if their two bedroom council house becomes too small to accomodate them and their growing brood (and the teenage dad that lives there without the authorities knowing) then the counclil will happily move them to a bigger house usually within 6 weeks. Where I live, if you go into the town on a weekday the teenage mums are out and about in force pushing their prams or the newly pregnant ones proudly showing off their bumps (and stretch marks) in a tight fitting velour tracksuit. No doubt in years to come their daughters will be doing exactly the same thing. I could go on and on about this subject because I find it disgusting that the tax payer has to foot the bill for some loney teenage mother who didn't know what else to do with her life other than punch out a few kids. Me and my husband would like children but can't afford to have any because we both need to work. Also we live ina one bedroom flat. Maybe if we hadn't got married, I could have quit my job, pretend he's not living with me, have a child and get a nice three bed semi courtesy of the tax payer.|`|DhwcHdfVaa	There needs to more Sex education awareness programs, parents who are willing to talk to their kids about sex and protection.

AA11440601	On August 12, 1950 Pope Pius XII said in his encyclical Humani generis: <br>  <br>  The Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God. <br>  <br>  Here is the complete encyclical: <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xii/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xii_enc_12081950_humani-generis_en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x...</a><br>  <br>  And here is the Address of Pope John Paul II to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences on October 22, 1996 speaking of the Theory of Evolution: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp02tc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/library/docs_jp...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an interesting article about Pope John Paul II's opinion in the matter: <a href="http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=4627" rel="nofollow">http://www.americamagazine.org/content/a...</a><br>  <br>  The Church supports science in the discovery of God's creation.

WjRqYf6naa	Priest and Father are mostly used in Catholicism and Anglicanism, Minister and Pastor are usually Protestant. All these are job titles, usually for the clergyman in charge of a local church. Reverend is a title of respect for a clergyman and can be either Protestant or Catholic.<br>  <br>  A Bishop is a clergyman in a supervisory role, usually a Catholic, Anglican or Methodist. An Archbishop is a more senior supervisor. A  Cardinal is a very senior Catholic clergyman. And of course there is the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  Rabbis, of course, are Jewish. Some Holiness and Pentecostal denominations use the title Brother for their clergy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps explain things to you.|`|AA11272456	If you mean titles by which to address another human (i.e., Reverend George, Most Holy Father Frank, Right Reverend Sam), there is absolutely no difference, for they all glorify the person holding the title and they all violate the principle Jesus taught at Matthew 23:1-12.<br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul|`|nzdDdKtyaa	From my understanding, "Priest" and "Father" indicate one who is more spiritually capable, "closer to God" than you.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation‚ÄîJesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|E9chZY74aa	Wow!

I can count all my bones. They look, they stare at me; They divide my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast lots. <br>  <br>  Isaiah 53:5 But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His mouth. By oppression and judgment He was taken away; And as for His generation, who considered That He was cut off out of the land of the living For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due? His grave was assigned with wicked men, Yet He was with a rich man in His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.

5THWjgyyaa	If you consider the fact that we certainly exist then it must come to reason that we must have got here somehow. <br>  If you decide that 'something' put us here then that 'something' must be a being greater than us and like us capable of independent thought and action. <br>  If that being could create both us and the universe then that being must be by definition, 'God'.<br>  That's not 'provable' or 'undeniable', but to me it's obvious and it's logical. <br>  I also belive that God is love and that his son is Jesus who died and rose again to save all who would believe in him from the after-effects of all the evil that all men do in this world.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Absolute proof doesn't exist as any mathematician will tell you. The statement 1+1=2 isn't provable (it requires you to make assumptions - axioms, Google Kurt Godel).

He is the end with no end.  He is Omnipresent, Omniscient and Omnipotent.<br>  If you are confused on His existence perhaps this will explain a little for you to understand, i.e. You do not see the air you breath yet it exists.  You do not see the current in the electric power you use but it is there.  To prove the existence of only these two things, close your nose and hold your breath for just  5 minutes, for the former and touch an exposed electric live wire for the latter.  You will find out.  To prove the existence of the Almighty God,  you may try doing one of  these three things.  Go back to yesterday if you can; do not eat when you are hungry or just stop going to the toilet to discharge the end product of what you ate earlier.  If you cannot do any of these things, it is better for you to submit to the existence of the Whole Entity, the Creator of the Universe and all that is in it,  i.e. God.|`|rDI7EUVBaa	dude! do not look for logic in religion.

He's an invisible man, non existant|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	This world is a field of trial and examination, and a place of striving where man is accountable for his actions. So there should be some evidences to open window to the minds,but should not compel them to accept.<br>  God's existence is provable.<br>  Since the universe and beings exist, and within them are acts and creation; and since an orderly act cannot occur without an author, a meaningful book cannot be without a scribe, and a skilful embroidery be without an embroiderer; the purposeful acts which fill the universe surely have an author, and the meaningful letters and amazing embroideries which cover the face of the earth and are renewed from season to season have a scribe and an embroiderer.<br>  And since two governors directing the same matter spoils the order in that matter being spoilt; and since from a fly‚Äôs wing to the lamps in the heavens there is perfect order, there must be only one governor, one ruler. For the art and wisdom in everything is so wonderful it necessitates that the Maker of one thing is powerful over all things, to the extent that He knows every matter. Since this is so, if He was not One, there would have to be gods to the number of beings. These would be both opposed to and similar to one another, and it would therefore be a hundred thousand times impossible for this wonderful order not to be broken.<br>  Furthermore, since as is self-evidently apparent, at a command the classes of beings are in motion in a fashion a thousand times more well-ordered than an army -each group, from the stars, sun and moon and their motions to the flowers of the almond, displaying the decorations and uniforms the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One has conferred on it, and the motion He has determined, a thousand times more regularly and perfectly than an army- since this is so, the universe has an Absolute Ruler behind the veil of the Unseen to Whose command its beings look and conform.|`|vM9CxOKKaa	¬∑ You seek some sort of sign to confirm that there is a God but that is not the type of people he is looking for. Take a look at this scripture and then I will discuss it.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 55: 6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. <br>  <br>  I think we can tie these two thoughts together and come up with why you cannot find him. The two thoughts are:<br>  1. That he is saying that it is possible to find him by actually seeking him. That means work is involved.<br>  2. To actually get to know him we have to drop our unrighteous ways.<br>  <br>  We cannot sit back and wait for some type of sign to occur to make us believe. That is apparently not the people God is looking for. You see we can only get to know him by our work investigating his inspired written word. As we do this and we get to know him, the realisation of the import of his word will shine through and we will change our ways to comply with what he requires. Hence becoming righteous.<br>  <br>  This probably sounds a bit way out, but think of it this way. For reasons that can be found in the Bible, it can be seen and discerned that there is a challenge at hand. I'm not going to quote off scriptures and interpret it for you but I will give you the concept. This challenge involves Satin the Devil making accusation against God that people only follow God out of their own benefit and that if God did not do good things for people they would stop following him. Now Satin was not talking about only just a few people, he was suggesting all people. Satin being a liar had to be proved wrong through running the challenge. God has set up this continued environment to live in and stepped out of the picture for a while, not totally but in the sense that he does not provide for his people, as he wants to. This is like a loyalty test and I assume it has a two-fold purpose. One is it will prove Satin a liar and show that there would be a number of humans who would stick to him loyally. The second purpose would be to root out all those who would not even bother to find out about God and the good things he wants for mankind.<br>  <br>  A lot of people wonder why God just doesn't show his presence and do the good things that a God of love should be doing. He does plan to but first Satin must be proved a liar and he has set a timetable that only he knows. <br>  <br>  There are many other hidden treasures in the Bible to discern but we can only get to know them by our efforts to understand. There is no point in just saying there is no God; he will not prove it to us. You should be able to work out from what I have detailed that only if you try, you then may have a chance.|`|W7l1awFPaa	He did.  Jesus was born on earth, fulfilling many prophecies and making a few of his own.  He lived a perfect life and showed love to everyone he came in contact with.  He performed many miracles and taught us how to live.  Finally he died in our place on the cross.  God raised him from the dead and Jesus eventually ascended to heaven where he constantly intercedes for us.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	I read the article, and in as many words it just says that God wants to test us, otherwise we would believe but resent being shown outright who He is. In other words, it defends the "God doesn't want robots" strawman.<br>  <br>  It's fascinating to me that the author totally bypassed the story of Moses in Exodus 33.  If He showed His face, it would kill us. And we can see plenty of evidence of His glory in nature and the Word given to us. What's the problem?

AA10874030	I don't think many people feel sorry for drug addicts do they? After all, they're usually responsible for the majority of petty crime and shop lifting. Often these people have put their addictions before themselves, their family and anyone that has ever tried to help them. So no, I don't think people feel sorry for drug addicts at all.|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	because im looking at kids that are twenty years younger than i am who are on step fifteen while im still on step one.<br>  <br>  ("steps" in this case meaning the level of drug use they are indulging in, level one being a casual pot smoker with a stable career and step fifteen being on the streets begging and doing sexual favors for crack, meth and heroin.)|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	I think you're wrong, the media might be but the average guy on the street doesn't, I'm sure.

Something they see in the drug addict's condition they must see in themselves and they act according to how they would want to be treated.<br>  <br>  I would venture to guess that the people who are most sympathetic toward addicted users, see someone who has lost control of themselves and is completely unaware of the damage that has been done to them. Most people would want understanding if they had hurt themselves and family in ways they were no longer even aware of. And it would be a safe bet to imagine that same person might be doing something they know they shouldn't be.<br>  <br>  Another way to consider this question is to analyze why you feel sorry for the people you take pity on. Or you may even be able to just ask someone who feels very strongly about it. Maybe the person who inspired this question in the first place. Sympathy usually has very personal inspiration for the individual experiencing it.|`|Gh3UYjBJaa	Im not sure that they do but addiction is scientifically proven to be an actual disease that some people are more susceptible to than others as a result of genetics. Once in the grip they cant free themselves where other individuals may experiment and move on with ease. Depending on the drug, detox can be the most excruciating miserable sickeningly painful, nerve racking emotional experience one can ever go through. And once this is accomplished, the task of staying clean is difficult and consumes extraordinary will power every day if not every hour of ones life. Anyone can be susceptible to falling in the pit holes of drug abuse especialy the young making foolish decisions, peer pressure, innocent experimentation, escape, environment ext... and knowone knows who its going to hit the hardest. We all make mistakes, and at one tme or another do something we are not supposed to. Some however, use their disease as an excuse not to change while others override it and use their experience to help change lives.|`|rRI47iQUaa	Whoopdy doo quiting is for quiters lmao do you feal sorry for me hell no i dont feal sorry for myself im like super man or somthing every day leap tall buildings in a single bound aint nobody gunna bring me down|`|berHpm4eaa	because they have no life..they live on frugs...<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Because addictions are horrible things.

Or people think they have control of their use, and before they realize it the situation has flipped, and the drug use has control of them.<br>  <br>  Most drug addicts are broke and while na is free, rehab programs are not.  In fact, rehab programs totally miss the sickest patients because of cost.<br>  <br>  Yeah, some of them are bad people and do bad things.  But would they be if they werent addicted to drugs?  The question I ask myself about addicts....   if there was a medical treatment available to cure addictions that people could actually get, would they still be a drug addict doing bad things?|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Addiction is a disease, not a lack of character or willpower.
UO3i8BqVaa	1. Whatever.<br>  2. Except when to do so would piss people off.<br>  ~|`|E9chZY74aa	1) Who of us has never sinned but Christ?  So, none is righteous (righteous means right-doing).  The only way we become righteous is when we are baptized for the removal of sins and are clean, but this is because Christ has made it possible, which means that we are righteous only through Christ's righteousness.<br>  2) We must.  It is a command and we must make time, as we work, as we play, as we raise our children and in every walk of life.  Matthew 28:18-20  Go....!|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I think the first one is tricksy. First we really need to define righteousness. From Princeton Wordnet: "characterized by or proceeding from accepted standards of morality or justice". According to that, I think there are many righteous people in the world. I don't think I am, per se, because my morality appears to differ somewhat from the norm, but there are certainly people out there who are righteous. Of course, it is more commonly used to mean upholding of religious standards, and there, well, it certainly depends which religion you're talking about. I don't think anyone really follows the Bible any more (Do you ever wear polycotton shirts? Naughty!) But other religions might be less strict or more closely followed.<br>  <br>  The second one, I disagree with. I can see why you'd want to, really, but look at it from the other point of view. It comes across as insulting and condescending. I don't mind your religion, but its vaguely irritating to have people telling me about how great the Bible is wherever I go.|`|AA11992885	1)  false, righteousness is largely dependent upon how one defines that, and there are several scripture which declare a person as sinless, being blameless of anything, both in the Jewish bible, AND even in the NT......SEVERAL PEOPLE............fact is, it is WAY TOO EASY to abide by God's laws......after all, why would God give a law that was impossible to adhere to............there are places in scripture which says that no one is righteous, and this should be taken in context.......the prophets were speaking to a SPECIFIC group of people, in a SPECIFIC time........nowhere in the texts of the Jewish bible does it EVER say that everyone in all times, commit sins and transgressions..........the real funny thing is, the very person who you think is without sin, when compared to what the Torah says, he is a vile sinner, claiming that he did NOT sin........he makes claims just like any other criminal, that despite he did this or that, he didn't do anything wrong, he had the authority to do it<br>  <br>  2)  so the answer to this one, false.  the gospels are filled with lies about a false prophet|`|CXAKpeH3aa	It's true that none are perfectly righteous, but we should follow the way of the righteous.

I can't imagine how empty their lives must be without feeling the perfect Love of their Creator.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Dark sided!|`|c0KKHMsAaa	why are you scared to admit he isn't?|`|AA11992885	you arrogantly assume that it is fear that causes them to think HE isn't real<br>  <br>  isn't that backwards logic.......after all, with no hard definitive evidence, you are the scared one, scared to admit that HE is NOT real despite the lack of imperical evidence<br>  <br>  the very notion that you have of God, there is no proof, but in your belief that it is all about faith, God has to refrain from providing proof, and thus, you have created a self-fulfilling prophecy of ignorance and stupidity|`|AA11657031	Ok. Let's see how I can answer your question without offending you. (Just in case if you are a Christian.) First off, I'm an atheist because I don't believe in God. I'm not scared to admit that he is real because he isn't. <br>  <br>  I grew up in the Christian religion. And I'm going to tell you, it was so depressing being a Christian. Once I grew up and looked at the picture clearly I learned that he wasn't real. And trust me, no one influenced me. Absolutly no one. I just woke up one day and thought "Hmm, I don't think God's real and I will not waste another second believing he is." It took me years to admit to my mom why I refused to go to church anymore, why I gave up on praying, and why I never spoke about God anymore. In the end she accepted it. She doesn't approve but she's letting me go down my own path.<br>  <br>  But now I'm better. I am happier now more than ever because I gave up on believing that God was real. <br>  <br>  One question I have for you is: why are Christians afraid to admit God is not real? Why can't Christians admit to the possibility that he isn't real? Would it break your perfect picture?<br>  <br>  In all reality Christianity and any religion is a way to control the masses. It's a way to make people believe and follow each other. It's kind of sad but if it works for religious people then go ahead.|`|DwhOX4E2aa	Since science can prove that we evolved from lower life why are religious people afraid to admit that god is fake?|`|vIw47BEFaa	Only fragrance can join with fragrance to become fragrance.

Logic is their God.  Faith is correctly assessed as "illogical" and therefore precluded from possibility.  I believe the words of Jesus, who said:  "As a man believeth in his heart, so shall it also be unto him".  In that manner, the atheist is correct.  For him, there is no god.|`|bMVJkCShaa	Hey, I gave Him a chance to prove himself, he didn't.<br>  <br>  If he's real, and he's got the balls to show himself to me, then I'll accept his existence.

Some may really not believe in God.  Some may not want to change their habits.  Some may not want to expose their sins (I think John 3 talks about that).  Really, they will all bow down to God, we know this.  Though only those who accept Jesus into their hearts will get to heaven.  It's really sad though.  They have all they need in God, and God's love is missing from their life, but the wrath of God remains on them.  There is so much relationship with their Maker they could have, which defines WHO we are, were made to be, that they don't get.  I hope they can.  The bible says whoever seeks, REALLY seeks, finds.  God has spoken audibly to me, I've had the Holy Spirit enter me, before I was saved I had satan enter me (2 witnesses to that one also), a long time ago my ex and I both had satan enter the room when she asked me if I ever wondered what he looked like.  It's all real people.  God wants you to accept it by FAITH.  Doesn't mean He won't provide evidence, but He would like you to show that you WANT Him to exist, Want to learn about Him, Want it to be true.  That you WANT to turn from your sins, accept Jesus as savior.  If your Really do that, the "proof" comes next, ... I'm not sure how long for others... I've heard others stories about it coming.  If nothing else, in the next life.  Which, is not very far away.  You will die soon.  But if you don't have the kind of faith that sees God in His creation, that hears Him in nature, that finds Him in His word, that is at peace in Him in true prayer, that finds Him in praising Him...... how much faith do you REALLY have?  This is not a game.  The stakes are higher than your life.  They are higher than even torture.  Why do you think people have died for this faith without denying Christ?  I would not die for a delusion.  I know what I know.  I can't deny the existence of someone that I have spoken with, any more than I can deny my own existence.  Anyone claiming me to be crazy would have to claim those who were ALSO there to be crazy, or a conspiracy.  And more than one.  Several, with different people.  Of course God simply can't be real, then there is accountability.  Then there is the UNKNOWN.  Then, I"m out of my comfort zone, walking by faith, and not sight.  Well, better here, than there.  When you don't have a second chance.  The decisions are made in THIS lifetime.  The reason people died for the faith w/out denying it is because, there is something in this life worth more than life itself..... eternal life.  Who witnessing their death do you think may have taken that to heart, and been saved, made right with God through Jesus, when back home?  What reward awaited the man whose life was taken?  Many have come to Christ that were killing the christians themselves, quickly finding themselves martyrs in the process, b/c of their testimonies.  Whoever clings to this life, will lose it.  But whoever gives up this life for Jesus and the sake of the Kingdom, will find real life.<br>  <br>  Find real life.  Stop living for nothing, or for perishable people, perishable goods...... everything burns.  God is eternal.<br>  <br>  You will Die.<br>  Will you then live?|`|TYstsM7Yaa	Im not scared. I just prefer not to lie. If i said I believed God existed, i would be lieing and im not going to do so.|`|sohnrZDcaa	If the Bible God is real he may force me to slaughter and cook my children for dinner!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created the story of the Jewish God that is worshipped by gullible Christians today mainly in America. This God forced the Jews to eat their own children for dinner NOT AS A PUNISHMENT, but as an option in times of famine. Not even as an option, but as the ‚ÄúWILL OF GOD!‚Äù God NEVER objected about slaughtering and cooking children for dinner. God won‚Äôt let the Jews eat pigs, but children YES! The Preachers always cover up anything negative about the Bible God! I dropped out of Christianity and religion after many years serving in the Christian ministry! ANY preacher today has to be very dishonest not to admit any of these facts! The Bible was written to control low IQ religious people who need to pay a 10% (TITHE) crutch to function in this world. Any religion back then was as barbaric as you can‚Äôt possibly imagine. The Bible is a hangover from those days... Rather recently America became officially ONE NATION UNDER GOD and IN GOD WE TRUST under Christian pressure after the collapse of the US gold monetary system! <br>  <br>  This Bible God is totally powerless to teach any lesson without FORCING the Jews to eat their own children for dinner. The Bible writers say that Palestine was a ‚ÄúLand Flowing with Milk and Honey‚Äù ONLY before the Israelite invasion. The former dwellers used to live in plenty! After the invasion SURPRISE!!! suddenly the ‚Äúmilk and honey‚Äù stopped flowing! So now the Bible writers are promising to Israel that ‚ÄúGod will make the desert to blossom like a rose!‚Äù The perennial carrot hanging at the end of the stick is working!<br>  <br>  God‚Äôs sadistic pleasures are the kinkiest ones ever to be imagined! None of the ‚ÄúGodless‚Äù dictators in the world EVER thought of forcing his people to eat their own children for dinner...! That is so repulsive that no smut publication is publishing anything like that either, but any pervert preacher can discreetly enjoy reading all about it in the Holy Bible! The rest of Christians are totally brainwashed with the GOD IS LOVE bit! No wonder the Clergy hid the Bible from public view for so many centuries! To their great relief hardly any Christian today pays attention to what they read in the Bible! <br>  <br>  Leviticus 26:29 - (God is impatiently saying) YOU WILL eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters* (*without warning of any evil! Christians are trained to believe that no matter how pervert it may sound ‚Äúif God says it I believe it‚Ä¶ and that settles it!‚Äù)<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 28:53-57 - Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege* (*God is conditioning the mind of the Israelites 700 Bible years into the future! In our society today anybody promoting the idea of any crime like that is put in jail!), YOU WILL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, THE FLESH OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS the LORD your God has given you* (*God WILL NOT do anything to protect the innocent children, but his chosen people will enjoy eating them‚Ä¶! Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus‚Ä¶ Amen?) Even the most gentle and sensitive man* (*not a sinful homosexual or a Godless atheist, but a CHOSEN CHILD OF GOD!) among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his SURVIVING children, and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating‚Ä¶* (*according to the Bible writers, not sharing is ‚ÄúTHE SIN‚Äù! Only religious perverts can dream on feeding on their own children for ever!)<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 19:9 I* (*God, NOT SATAN, but GOD!) WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS* (This sick God has to FORCE the Jews to eat their own children! During the real historic Roman siege of ‚ÄúMasada‚Äù [do Google] all the Jewish families killed themselves before even dreaming about eating their own children!)<br>  <br>  God won‚Äôt force the Jews to eat PIGS, but their own children YES! The Bible writers say that when the 666 mark will be instituted Christians won‚Äôt be able to buy or sell food without it. Based on Bible precedents, will the heart bleeding Christians of the Westboro orientation eat their own children for dinner? Christians would deny it or say that if God forced the Jews to do it, it was because they were very ‚Äúsinful‚Äù!<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 5:10 - Therefore in your midst fathers WILL EAT THEIR CHILDREN...<br>  <br>  Any secular government would offer its citizens better protection than the Bible God. They would certainly allow them to eat pork instead of children! It took Moses 2 men to carry a single bunch of gigantic size grapes to show Israel how plentiful was the Land of Palestine that they were going to invade (Num 13:23)! Actually that was just another trick in the Bible script to motivate well fed Jews into COVETING* (*the heck with the 10 Commands!) to leave Egypt and to invade the Holy Land. (BTW, there is not a shred of historical evidence that millions of slave Jews ever lived in Egypt or that they ever ate their children!) Now the Jews can eat their own children in the Holy Land for God‚Äôs kinky pleasure! Actually, for the pleasure of wanking Bible writers and some freaky Bible readers today!<br>  <br>  Lamentations 4:10 - With their own hands COMPASSIONATE WOMEN* (*GODLY WOMEN‚Ä¶! Not lesbians or atheistic ladies, but ‚ÄúMANY‚Äù God loving heterosexual ladies) HAVE COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN...!<br>  <br>  Here is a case in FULL EXPLICIT CONTEXT in the Bible that is IMPOSSIBLE for any Preacher to ‚Äúspiritualize‚Äù and make it go away!<br>  <br>  2 Kings 6:26-29 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, ‚ÄúHelp me, my lord the king* (*a God related King)!‚Äù The king replied, ‚ÄúIf the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? Then he asked her, ‚ÄúWhat's the matter?‚Äù She answered, ‚ÄúThis woman said to me, ‚ÄòGive up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.‚Äô So we cooked my son and ate him* (*BTW‚Ä¶ it came out delicious!!!). The next day I said to her, ‚ÄòGive up your son so we may eat him, but she had hidden him!* (*God cursed woman! She cheated!) <br>  <br>  They were all COMPASSIONATE Godly, non-Atheistic, heterosexual women that HAVE SLAUGHTERED AND COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR DINNER at the tune of ‚ÄúThe LORD is my Shepherd I shall not want‚Äù (Psa 23)!<br>  <br>  Isaiah 49:15 ‚ÄúCan a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I* (*God) WILL NOT FORGET YOU!* (*I‚Äôll make her eat the child! Hey, not even Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde is that scary! God must have a serious psychopathic disorder and ought to see a shrink!)<br>  <br>  The last bunch of Bible writers claim that God the Son Jesus Christ was beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers‚Äô spit to become the dignified ‚ÄúLamb of God‚Äù grotesquely nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross. The Romans never dressed the genitals of their victims with a diaper! The Christians need to snack his ROMAN SPIT FLAVORED MEAT AND DRINK HIS HOLY BLOOD to go to Heaven when they die! (John 6:53) The eating of children is part of the BIBLE tale so the forever snacking on the Jesus Christ in the Holy Communion is not half that bad!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that God‚Äôs enemies ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?) <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, HAPPY is he who repays you for what you have done to us* (*Holy Vendetta! The heck with ‚Äúgiving the other cheek!‚Äù) --he who seizes your infants and DASHES them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  Needed abortions today are for HUMANE reasons! Only the fetus is destroyed not a born child! According to the Bible God requires that the children be dashed to pieces or slaughters and cooked for dinner after they are born! God‚Äôs Chosen People (Israel ‚Äì Christians claim to be the ‚Äúspiritual Israel‚Äù today) will ravish some horny ladies while DASHING THEIR CHILDREN AGAINST THE ROCKS ‚Äì PRAISE THE LORD Sweet Jesus! <br>  <br>  Isaiah 13:16 (KJV) Their little ones also WILL BE DASHED TO PIECES before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished‚Ä¶. (the wanking Bible writers claim that some ladies of God‚Äôs enemies will be ravished to their delight while their children are being DASHED TO PIECES ‚Äì GOD IS CONDITIONING THE MIND OF HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE FOR THIS SORT OF DEPRAVITY!)<br>  <br>  God the Son Jesus Christ is hardly any better than his Daddy God!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (In his apocalyptic ‚Äúrevelation‚Äù Jesus Christ says) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies --not fetuses, but children! God the Father forced Israel to eat their children for dinner now God the Son Jesus Christ promised to kill the children in the wrong Churches so they can learn a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS and to add insult to injury, preachers are getting rich selling books on Jesus‚Äô love for the little children of the world! Today, Jesus Christ would be in jail for bullying about killing any child to favor a particular brand of faith!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia talks like that in public! I don‚Äôt believe that the Mafia ever threatened to kill any children like Jesus does without asking for any ransom money!)<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that the Bible was written by a bunch of wanking perverts!

xuuaMTmtaa	Only barrier protection is effective against STD's  (i.e. a condom)<br>  <br>  spermicides do NOT protect against STD's.  Most condoms already come with spermicidal lubricant.  The one most often used is nonoxynal-9 (I think I spelled that right).  This is used to kill sperm to prevent pregnancy.  It is NOT used for STD protection. <br>  <br>  The best method is to use a condom WITH a spermicide, so that you get STD protection as well as birth control protection (unless you're gay..which I'm going to assume you are if you're in this section) <br>  <br>  ALWAYS USE A CONDOM.

Public health officials and health care workers should actively discourage MSM from using N-9-containing lubricants for anal sex and promote awareness of the many N-9-free, water-based alternatives available to facilitate condom use.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  (and there's a few studies in regards to condoms containing n-9 somewhere else... and then there's the neverending polyurethane vs latex debates.)|`|3OZgcntfaa	Spermicides like Nonoxynol-9 have actually been shown to cause abrasions on anal and vaginal tissues, which could put you at higher risks for irritation and STD entry if you are not using a barrier method.<br>  <br>  Spermicides prevent sperm from getting around.

This applies to all belief systems.

hms0bSiaaa	Yes. Yes. Yes. God knows you from your mother's womb. And He exactly knows how to deal with you.<br>  <br>  You, like the rest of all of us here, are a sinner. But God in His own love and grace for us (His obra maestra), provided us with a Solution so that those who believe, accept and receive this Solution will not perish but have eternal life in heaven.<br>  <br>  But being truly sorry is not enough for God to forgive us our sins. We have to "incorporate" or "unite" ourselves, our lives, our whole with the Solution, even Jesus Christ. Thus, God could see Jesus' perfection and holiness in us and not our imperfections and sins in us.<br>  <br>  "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, Jesus Christ to die on the Cross for our sins and whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life."  (John 3:16)<br>  <br>  "This is the testimony: God has given us eternal life and this life is in His Son.  He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the son of God does not have life." (1 John 5:11,12)<br>  <br>  Would you like to have assurance of eternal life?  Have you accepted Jesus?  Then pray this prayer:<br>  <br>  "Lord, I realize I am a sinner and I need a Savior. I know that Your Son, Jesus Christ died on the Cross for my sins. Please forgive me of my sins as I open my heart to Him so that He may become my Lord, God and Savior. Please make me a new person as I commit my Life to You. Thank you for giving me your Holy Spirit. Amen."<br>  <br>  If you prayed this prayer rest assured that you will spend your life in eternity with God in heaven. You can find a Bible-believing and Christ-centered church in your area and you can fellowship with them as you grow as a Christian.<br>  <br>  God bless you.|`|E9JigTskaa	yes god will forgive you, <br>  <br>  if you ask him, and believe that he will, he will give you the strength and help provide you with the resources that you need when you are truly ready to accept his help.<br>  <br>  to give up your addition you have to want to, you can't give it up just because other people want you to.|`|xkSwcCW1aa	Yes God will surely forgive you. Years ago I used to steal money from my mum's purse. I even promised God I will stop but I broke my promise. I thought God would never forgive me. But the last time was when I stole a huge some of money. This time it touched my heart. I wasn't caught but I reported myself to my mum. I told her to forgive. She then told me she had forgiven me. That was how the addiction of stealing was broken in my life. I also prayed to God to forgive me and I know he has forgiven me. Guilt is one of the greatest tool of the day. It can keep a man striving with sin for a long time.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	First of all, Jesus is God.  <br>  <br>  "Promising things to God" is NOT NECESSARY.  Don't do it, because we're all sinners and we all still sin. <br>  <br>  All saved believers are still sinners. <br>  <br>  And "being truly sorry" is NOT the way to be forgiven of sins.  Nobody will be forgiven that way. <br>  <br>  The only way to be forgiven, is by BELIEVING in Jesus alone for salvation.  And when you believe, then you are forgiven ALL SINS past, present, and future, no matter what those sins are.  <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|TYstsM7Yaa	you broke a promise with god. who cares. God surely doesn't. Only you can forgive yourself.|`|CXAKpeH3aa	yes. God always forgives.|`|WjRqYf6naa	Yes, you will be forgiven if you are truly sorry. Addictions are hard to break. Pray to God for the strength to be an overcomer.|`|IFQFt25naa	Whether or not you are forgiven is between you and Our Lord for only the two of you know for sure what is in your heart.  If you are really and truly sorry or just saying that you are as so many people do to try to get forgiveness.<br>  <br>  If you are sincerely sorry and sincerely trying to do better The Bible teaches you will be forgiven.<br>  <br>  However, I would make one additional suggestion.  Addictions are difficult to break (no kidding, huh?).  Many people forget it is also important to change the influences around you that are tempting you to fall back into the same negative routines.  If this means giving up some friends/acquaintances it may be difficult to do but if that is what is pulling you back (if they are not helping you stay away from the problem) they are not really your friends to begin with.<br>  <br>  You said you have failed 5 times.  What has caused you/tempted you to slip each time? While you are asking Our Lord for forgiveness, you might want to ask him to help you to keep the temptations away and surround you with people that well help keep you away from those temptations until you are strong enough to stand up to the temptations and say no to them yourself.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not I do understand what you are going though better than you might think. Just keep fighting and resisting it one day, one hour, even one minute at a time.   Once you can control the desires (for they will always be there from time to time) you will beat ‚Äúthe devil‚Äù.  <br>  <br>  If nothing else, try to create the ‚Äúhabit of delaying‚Äù succumbing to the desire(s), ‚ÄúYes I want to do this, but I am not going to do it right now, I can wait another day (or another hour) before I do.‚Äù  Get yourself into a less tempting situation, then when that "time is up", do the same again, ‚ÄúYes I want to do this, but I am not going to do it right now, I can wait another day (or another hour) before I do.‚Äù  <br>  <br>  It probably took a long time for you to get into this habit/addiction it will take a long time to totally break it.  But believe it or not in time it does become easier and easier to resist.  <br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|FgRUdQOBaa	Yes, God will forgive you as many times as you ask.<br>  We are all sinners, not one of us is any better and there is no limit on God's infinite love and capacity for forgiveness.|`|8765ea9ad82eb11dbeae3ab65abec135aa	If God forgives you every time you f*ck up, what's the problem?  It's far easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to resist temptation, so what the hell?  Do it, enjoy it, square things up with God afterwords. Works for me.|`|LlRAOMq8aa	God has mercy and iis ready to forgive but you should not be doing it as aj oke,just try and leave the addiction slowily andpray alot God will help|`|cfd799ae3af764d62aaee45bc1bb1c06aa	No, god won't, because she doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  BUT I FORGIVE YOU ...<br>  <br>  AND YOU SHOULD TOO.<br>  <br>  Kudos for trying and I wish you every success.<br>  <br>  LOVE and PEACE

The fact that you are aware of your sinful nature is evidence of your listening to the Holy Spirit. If you listen to what he has testified in your heart about Jesus and choose to believe in him and not the things that you have done, you will secure your destiny. Ask God to show you that you are safe if you are in Jesus. Pray for God to save you and ask for a new life and a new heart.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you right now.<br>  <br>  Mark 3:28-30 (Larger context: 3:20-30)<br>  <br>  28 "Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;<br>  <br>  29 but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"--<br>  <br>  30 because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."|`|CXAKpeH3aa	I'm also scared of dying. But those who are confident believers in God are prepared for death, but don't know when. That's why you live your life to the fullest. And yes, God forgives any sinner. His forgiveness is limitless. No matter how big the sin. He'll forgive. But you have to mean it that you need God. You can't take back the sin, but God will always forgive.

The "thumbs down" (and indeed the "thumbs up") dates from Roman times; when a gladiator was defeated in the arena, his opponent would look at the Emperor (or whoever the most important person present was) to see if he gave the "thumbs down" - which was an instruction to put the losing gladiator to death - or the "thumbs up", which meant that the loser's life was to be spared. In modern times both signs are used in many Western Societies to indicate approval or disapproval, but it other societies they can have different meanings. For example, I understand that in Iran a "thumbs up" sign is the equivalent of our "middle finger" sign.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	Down thumb, or thumb(s) down.|`|UzMcNOCRaa	thumbs down|`|a4crNiGdaa	thumbs down<br>          =))

I agree with what you said but that doesn't matter here, truth is both sides have been indoctrinated, I highly doubt that any of your responders have studied creation science, or that you have studied evolution.  I have studied both, and i find creation the much better answer. Both are nonprovable, both are based on faith.  And without presuppositions both would be nonsense. My belief in God, and my belief in the Bible lead me on my search, and they have never, nor will ever let me down. Evolutionists will not consider creation, for if they do they have to admit being duped by lies, and so vehemently defending a religion.  You need to study evolution and creation, and if you are a believer God will guide you.

We see just such an arrangement in a unique, consistent, well-defined hierarchy, the so-called tree of life. <br>  <br>  Different lines of evidence give the same arrangement of the tree of life. We get essentially the same results whether we look at morphological, biochemical, or genetic traits. <br>  <br>  Fossil animals fit in the same tree of life. We find several cases of transitional forms in the fossil record. <br>  The fossils appear in a chronological order, showing change consistent with common descent over hundreds of millions of years and inconsistent with sudden creation. <br>  <br>  Many organisms show rudimentary, vestigial characters, such as sightless eyes or wings useless for flight. <br>  <br>  Atavisms sometimes occur. An atavism is the reappearance of a character present in a distant ancestor but lost in the organism's immediate ancestors. We only see atavisms consistent with organisms' evolutionary histories. <br>  <br>  Ontogeny (embryology and developmental biology) gives information about the historical pathway of an organism's evolution. For example, as embryos whales and many snakes develop hind limbs that are reabsorbed before birth. <br>  <br>  The distribution of species is consistent with their evolutionary history. For example, marsupials are mostly limited to Australia, and the exceptions are explained by continental drift. Remote islands often have species groups that are highly diverse in habits and general appearance but closely related genetically. Squirrel diversity coincides with tectonic and sea level changes (Mercer and Roth 2003). <br>  Such consistency still holds when the distribution of fossil species is included. <br>  <br>  Evolution predicts that new structures are adapted from other structures that already exist, and thus similarity in structures should reflect evolutionary history rather than function. We see this frequently. For example, human hands, bat wings, horse legs, whale flippers, and mole forelimbs all have similar bone structure despite their different functions. <br>  The same principle applies on a molecular level. Humans share a large percentage of their genes, probably more than 70 percent, with a fruit fly or a nematode worm. <br>  <br>  When two organisms evolve the same function independently, different structures are often recruited. For example, wings of birds, bats, pterosaurs, and insects all have different structures. Gliding has been implemented in many additional ways. Again, this applies on a molecular level, too. <br>  <br>  The constraints of evolutionary history sometimes lead to suboptimal structures and functions. For example, the human throat and respiratory system make it impossible to breathe and swallow at the same time and make us susceptible to choking. <br>  <br>  Suboptimality appears also on the molecular level. For example, much DNA is nonfunctional. <br>  Some nonfunctional DNA, such as certain transposons, pseudogenes, and endogenous viruses, show a pattern of inheritance indicating common ancestry. <br>  <br>  Speciation has been observed. <br>  <br>  The day-to-day aspects of evolution -- heritable genetic change, morphological variation and change, functional change, and natural selection -- are seen to occur at rates consistent with common descent.|`|cfd799ae3af764d62aaee45bc1bb1c06aa	Bullshit!

Like other cave-dwelling animals, fish that live in caves have often lost their eyes and body colour, but the evolutionary mechanisms underlying these reductions are unknown. There are 86 species of cave fish that belong to 18 different families, and many of them have lost their eyes independently. Comparing cave fish to their free-living ancestors can thus help us understand convergent evolution. However, the ancestors of most cave species are already extinct, with the notable exception of the Mexican Blind Cave fish.<br>  <br>  How did they lose their eyes? The signaling molecule sonic hedgehog (Shh) is involved in eye, jaw, and taste bud development in the Mexican cave fish. During embryonic development, Shh expression is expanded in the cave fish compared to surface fish, causing eye degeneration and an increase in the number of taste buds. This pleiotropic effect supports the trade-off theory."<br>  <br>  This is an example of how alterations to one gene or protein can affect many different parts of the body. In this case, the increased taste buds are beneficial as it allows the fish to source food in the dark. It just so happens that this affects the development of their eyes and it looks like the are lost through disuse or some amazing design. <br>  <br>  For those who find it hard to unite faith and Christianity, please consider the following verse:<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:18-20 (New International Version)<br>  <br>   18 I also thought, "As for men, God tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals. 19 Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath [a] ; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is meaningless. 20 All go to the same place; all come from dust, and to dust all return.<br>  <br>  There are probably a million ways to interpret that passage, but I find it interesting that man is said to share the same breath or spirit as the beasts, that man and his fate is the same as the animals and that both come from dust and to dust return.

YZv8Ub3Haa	NO.<br>  <br>     1.  The "mitochondrial Eve," to which this claim refers, is the most recent common female ancestor, not the original female ancestor. There would have been other humans living earlier and at the same time. The mtDNA lineages of other women contemporary with her eventually died out. Mitochondrial Eve was merely the youngest common ancestor of all today's mtDNA. She may not even have been human.<br>  <br>     2. The same principles find that the most recent human male common ancestor ("Y-chromosome Adam") lived an estimated 84,000 years after the "mitochondrial Eve" and also came from Africa (Hawkes 2000; Underhill et al. 2000; Yuehai et al. 2001).<br>  <br>     3. The results assume negligible paternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, but that assumption has been called into question. Male mtDNA resides in the tail of the sperm; the tail usually does not enter the egg that the sperm fertilizes, but rarely a little bit does. It is also possible that there is some recombination of mtDNA between lineages, which would also affect the results (Awadalla et al. 1999; Eyre-Walker et al. 1999). But these challenges have themselves been questioned (Kivisild et al. 2000).|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Not really. All it means is that she is the last common ancestor of everyone alive today.

Beyond his work in medicine, he also made significant contributions in philosophy, mathematics, chemistry, and astronomy and was the author of over 200 books. <br>  Take Aristotle, for instance. Only a fraction of his work was known in Europe during the post-classical era, when barbarian invasions caused the loss of so much earlier culture. But most of his books were translated into Arabic, and were studied and commented on over and over again in Baghdad and other centers. European philosophers rediscovered them via these commentaries. Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were famous names in medieval philosophy and their predecessor al-Farabi (Alfarabius) is said to have lectured on Aristotle's Physics 40 times and his Rhetoric 80 times.<br>  Al-Khwarizmi is recognized as the founder of modern Algebra. The actual name of algebra comes from the title of his most famous book, Kitab Al-Jabr wa al-Muqabilah ("The Book of Integration and Equation"). This book on algebra, in its translated form, was the  principal mathematics textbook in European universities until the 16th century. <br>  The astrolabe was a critical development for both the Muslim and Western world. (A history of the astrolabe is given at <a href="http://www.astrolabes.org/HISTORY.HTM.)" rel="nofollow">http://www.astrolabes.org/HISTORY.HTM.)</a> And, there are several different types of astrolabes. By far the most popular type is the planispheric astrolabe, on which the celestial sphere is projected onto the plane of the equator. A planispheric astrolabe consists of two flat circular disk. One of the disks has a map of the sky on its face. The second disk shows the horizon, the lines of altitude for a specific latitude and the zenith (The zenith is the "point of the celestial sphere that is directly over the observer and 90 degrees from all points on that person's horizon" (Encarta, 2000)).  <br>  <br>  It would be simplistic to look upon the Muslim world merely as the conduit for Greek knowledge transferred to Europe. Yes, the classical works of Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen were eventually transferred to Europe through Islamic Spain. However, Muslim contributions to chemistry are more significant than these transfers, particularly in the areas of chemistry and medicine. The medical knowledge available in the Muslim world was so far advanced as compared to the Medieval West. Muslim innovation and work in chemistry and medicine flourished from about 900 - 1200 AD. After the translation efforts of Toledo and other places, books from Arab sources became standard medical texts in Europe.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	Most, if not all, of the scientific advancements claimed by Islam were actually discovered by the ancient Greeks.|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	an exhausted list for you: <br>  <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~salems2/muslim_contribution_to_the_world.html" rel="nofollow">http://members.tripod.com/~salems2/musli...</a><br>  <br>  gimme 2 points!|`|tL5vlITcaa	example: significant part of modern Algebra.|`|JaDHlVNCaa	Although the Christians Bible is the Book of Allah.But in Present condition it is the Mixture, not the Original one.Though it may be Possible the Scientific discoveries are discovered are true.<br>  1:In our Holy Quran it is clear 1400 Years ago.Whole Univerce is Moving in the selected Boundry given to each.

MkHiAHrsaa	I think everyone is a little jingoistic in their view of the world.  There is really no way to be totally objective about one's "place in the world" when you were born into a particular culture.  Having said that, there is no monolithic "American" worldview.  We are individuals with individual perspectives and opinions.  I cannot speak for all Americans, only myself.  <br>  <br>  I majored in history in undergraduate school, so I am obviously interested in the past and in how the past has influenced the present.  One cannot understand the history of the USA without understanding the histories of the countries that contributed to our population.  Just as the UK needs to understand the Romans, Normans, Celts, etc. to understand what impact they had on the history of the UK.  Irish, Indian, Singapore, Caribbean nations, etc. have to study their history through a lens that looks at the impact British colonialism had on their countries.<br>  <br>  Throughout world history, world powers have risen and then fallen.  Can the history of those empires state that they saw their role as benevolent?  It all depends on perspective.  There were Romans and there were barbarians with precious little in between if you look at the Roman view.  Other peoples would have said that Romans were oppressors who made slaves of the conquered.  America has nothing on the ancient Roman empire in terms of arrogance <g>.  Look at England and their sojourn in India.  Was that good for India?  When Britain ruled the seas and colonized around the world, I would submit that their overriding opinion was ethnocentric in nature.  What nation grew rich off of the slave trade of the 17th and 18th centuries?  England.  Did they have some type of obligation to look out for the rights of others during that time or did their ethnocentric view of the world prevent them from being able to see the injustice of that practice?  <br>  <br>  Was it hypocritical of Americans to subjugate women and minorities when our Declaration of Independence stated that all "men" (mankind?) were created equal?  Or was it worldwide ethnocentrism and sexism that made it acceptable at the time but not presently?  Our opinions of what is "just" changes as our societies become more "enlightened" about what is morally right. <br>  <br>  As long as we have nations, we will have nationalism.  We all want our country to be morally and ethically good and I think we all have a tendency to debate among our fellow countrymen the good and the bad about our own country and the defend it against "outside" detractors.  That is just human nature.  In order to get past some of this defensiveness, we first need to admit to ourselves and to other nationalities that good men and women exist everywhere, just as bad men and women exist.  None of us are immune to corrupt government, greed, overzealous patriotism, etc.<br>  <br>  While I am a realist, I am also an idealist.  I see that America has great economic, media and military power.  With the fall of the Soviet Union, we became the ONLY super power in the world.  Power needs to be balanced so that people do not abuse it.  China may emerge as the counterbalance to American power or it could be India and frankly both of those scenarios scare me a little.  My view of human rights is very different than in those cultures.  I think America has abused her power to a certain extent.  The human rights violations during the "war on terror" sickened me.  I also know that when disasters strike around the world, American generosity is very quickly felt.  We have an obligation to the rest of the world to be the best that we can be and to use our power wisely.|`|7b105c20abc8cb7babb72ce9a68a74daaa	It does not matter weather or not we like other countries cultures and history because they move here and we are forced to live with it like it or not|`|UNR4AdvQaa	They think we are all backward and unlucky cos we are not American!|`|GCn6PTZfaa	Starting with Europe:<br>  Love the British.

xAQJuNcIaa	Act with dignity and do not respond to their anger-it is their emotions that are escaping them therefore its their problem and they need to build a bridge and get over it. Whilst you need to do what you are doing and maintain a dignified, calm response. Do not change your position unless you absolutely have to and people will respect you for it in the long run.

Please talk to or write a letter to the store manager regarding the 'snorting' incident. That behavior is unacceptable. <br>  <br>  You are right about not yelling in someone's face. I like the way you explain it. "...proves that the provoker got to that person." I never thought of it that way. <br>  <br>  Here's how I handle difficult people. If they are being disrespectful, I say, "I can tell by the way you are acting that I've done something wrong. Please tell me what I have done wrong." The person will say, "No, everything is fine."  Then you say, "I'm confused. You were being so rude. There must be a problem. Surely, you would not act that way unless there is a problem." <br>  <br>  That's just me. <br>  <br>  FYI: I'm an American living in the Philippines. I am also coping with cultural differences.

I just gained more confidence and became more assertive...and you can do so without being polite.  In fact, it completely shows up people when you 'kill them with kindness'.  When someone would get mad at me, I would get calmer.  Don't sink to their level. Use a firm tone of voice and even tone and people get the hint pretty quick.  I've been told I'm actually quite frightening when I do this because people think I'm some sort of 'contained fury'.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you had that experience.

sz52D7WDaa	Tyree... you have asked Jesus to be your Lord and Savior... and so it is done...God will never forsake you, and you will spend eternity with Him.<br>  <br>  Do not worry about random mind thoughts..they mean absolutely nothing. Just know in your heart that you are saved. Your mind has access to random thoughts just as when you are dreaming. If we chose to act on a thought, that means something. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder develops when a person gets carried away worrying about random thoughts and then chooses to act on them, like worrying that you did not lock the door even though you checked it ten times. When a dumb thought crosses your mind, it does NOT mean that you endorse the thought or want the thought to happen, etc. It just means a dumb thought happens to be going through your mind. Just move on to a positive thought. As the Word says, whatever is lovely, admirable, good , etc. dwell on these things. And bring every thought captive unto Christ. Do not worry, you are normal, everyone experiences the same thing.<br>  <br>  God bless!|`|gSxYuDEEaa	the moment you accepted Him the DEVIL, your enemy went to work on you attacking through your mind.

Many people who were brought up hearing the christian message have found 'jesus to be a ticking point for them and when they while not removing him but making him secondary to the creator they have found peace.<br>  Worth a try~?|`|9DW9irIGaa	the devil is probably trying to trip you up because he's just lost the battle for you. "your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour" (1 peter 5:8). get plugged into a bible-teaching church right away and get friends, your brothers and sisters in the Lord, to support you. above all, PRAY. read in ephesians 6 (starts in vs. 10??) about the armor of God. one thing that helps me is memorizing one verse that i need to remind myself of a lot, and posting it up in my house where i can see it. it's ok to doubt your faith sometimes; when you research it, it will strengthen your faith. but if you're constantly having negative thoughts and feelings, that's not from God. remember, God promises to give us "peace that passes understanding". you will get negative comments on here about how God isnt real. don't give up.<br>  <br>  lastly, Romans 10:9 says that you will be saved if... (read it). if you have followed that verse and repent and turn to follow God, then you are NOT going to hell! "death has lost its sting" for you, my friend. Read the book of Romans chapters 3, 4, and 8, they will encourage you. rest in God's love for you and read the bible to learn more about him. i pray that God will put your mind at ease... you're his child :)|`|xkSwcCW1aa	Relax it could be because of stress and too much thinking.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

wB3AbJyLaa	Even though slavery in some form was virtually universal in every human culture over centuries, it was the Christians who first came to the conclusion that it was wrong. The social historian writes: "Although it has been fashionable to deny it, anti-slavery doctrines began to appear in Christian theology soon after the decline of Rome and were accompanied by the eventual disappearance of slavery in all but the fringes of Christian Europe. When Europeans subsequently instituted slavery in the New World, they did so over strenuous papal opposition, a fact that was conveniently 'lost' from history until recently. Finally, the abolition of New World slavery was initiated and achieved by Christian activist." Christians began to work for abolition not because of some general understanding of human rights, but because they saw it as violating the will of God. Older forms of indentured servant-hood and the bond-service of Biblical times had often been harsh, but Christians abolitionists concluded that raced-based, life-long chattel slavery, established through kidnapping, could not be squared with Biblical teachings either in the Old Testament or the New. Christian activist such as William Wilberforce in Great Britain, John Woolman in America, and many, many others devoted their entire lives, in the name of Christ, to ending slavery. They slave trade was so tremendously lucrative that there was enormous incentive within the church to justify it. Many church leaders defended the institution. The battle for self-correction was titanic. When the abolitionists finally had British society poised to abolish slavery in their empire, planters in the colonies foretold that emancipation would cost investors enormous sums and the prices of commodities would skyrocket catastrophically. This did not deter the Abolitionists in the House of Commons. They agreed to compensate the planters for all free slaves, a astounding sum up to half of British government's annual budget. The Act of Emancipation passed in 1833, and the costs were so high to the British people that one historian called the British abolition of slavery "voluntary econocide."|`|AA11272456	This is an interesting subject matter which pops up from time to time and because of the provocative nature of the very word itself, 'slavery' tends to give honest-hearted ones reason to pause. It's sort of like the name 'Judas.'  Pretty much no one names their son Judas or even Benedict Arnold.  And why not?  Because these names have become synonymous with traitor and treason.  Yet the names are not inherently treasonous, are they?  No.  It is similar with slavery - neither the word nor the servitude meant is inherently evil.  Even the Bible makes plain that everyone is a slave of something or someone else.  Romans 6:16.  We are slaves to gravity.  And we cannot escape it.  But nobody seems to be complaining about not being able to walk off of a 50-story building.<br>  <br>  Indeed, Christians are slaves of the Most High God.  So because the term slave or slavery has become, in the minds of many, synonymous with evil, there is a tendency to denounce the scriptures and Christianity as being an unreliable source of morality or standards.  This should not be the case.  If a set of parents abuse their children to the point of disfigurement and death, does that mean parents are inherently evil?  Does that mean other children should not 'embrace' their parents?  No.  <br>  <br>  The first thing one must do is understand the slavery legislated in the Mosaic law. There is absolutely no comparison to servitude as regulated under the Mosaic Law and slavery practiced by Egyptians, Romans and white Europeans. Once you understand the difference in, and the reason for, the servitude under the Mosaic law, it becomes clear that there is no need for justification.  Enslavement of the African people was one of the most nefandous events in human history; indeed, this enslavement was described by some as a 'peculiar institution' because there were really no other parallels of slavery in history.  <br>  <br>  Exodus 21:7 deals with one of the many scenarios that could produce servitude.  Leviticus 25:44 describes yet another scenario wherein Israelites would come to have servants.  As for slavery in the so-called "New Testament," this too is quite interesting. However, it should be noted that this slavery was neither endorsed nor advocated by first-century Christians. Roman law allowed slavery; it was perfectly legal. Reprehensible as practiced by the Romans, yes. But legal. Their practice of slavery, however, finds no parallel, by the way, in the servitude that was regulated under the Mosaic law, as mentioned above. Were the first century Christians instructed to overthrow Roman slavery? No. Were they encouraged to fight for the freedom of Roman slaves? No. Did Jesus himself get involved in this socio-political issue or direct his followers to do so? No. Yet he was well aware of the situation. Indeed, he told his followers that they were no part of the world. That precluded taking up arms or even getting involved in politics to revise the social order. Some Christians were slaves as can be seen in Bible books. And the first century Christians certainly wanted freedom. We all do. But they were not prepared to violate the teachings of Christ to get it. <br>  <br>  All Christians ‚Äì then and now ‚Äì are commanded by God to obey the law of the land as long as that law does not require one to violate God's law. Slavery was legal. And while being a slave was not an enjoyable condition - being a slave did not violate God's law. God's kingdom will deal with all immoral conditions on this earth. Until it does, we are not to take matters into our own hands. We have the example of Jesus and his followers in this matter. <br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul|`|cNniG2L0aa	I could only read a little of that; it was one big block of words.<br>  Try spacing with new paragraphs next time.<br>  It looked like it coulda been interesting but dyslexia makes it hard to concentrate.<br>  Oh, maybe you didn't want us to read it with ease.<br>  Okay then.<br>  <br>  I think the subject is 'slavery'.<br>  I think you were surprised so many xians tried to excuse it in some way.<br>  <br>  Why would you be surprised?<br>  All of xiantity is about being subservient.<br>  <br>  Robert Ingersoll: <br>  The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and he made me king. <br>  He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me. <br>  Such is the justice of God." <br>  <br>  And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and vile. <br>  He made me holy and wise. <br>  If you do not obey me, God will punish you here and torment you hereafter. <br>  Such is the mercy of God."<br>  <br>  The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by both.<br>  The king owned the bodies and the priest the souls, of men. <br>  One lived on taxes, the other on alms. <br>  One was a robber, the other a beggar, and each was both.<br>  ~|`|pkNqVGFmaa	SLAVERY DOESNT BELONG TO CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES......ITS WAS INVENTED BY THE DEVIL ITSELF|`|c2fc70c8196fb6665f4605b33bcc57a4aa	The commenter " fountain" says he can walk away from his job any time he wants...so he's not a slave...<br>  Well, not for long anyway...<br>  Unless he is self employed, he becomes a slave to anyone who gives him a job. and he still has to budget his wages to cover his living expenses...<br>  the 'agreeable' slaves of those early Bible days had no such worries...they were fed and had a roof over their head..;.for as long as their master had wealth. <br>  What they had to forego was ambition to better themselves...to gain wealth themselves...|`|cVPq3s9zaa	You don't need to put EVERY thought racing through your brain regarding this issue in your question, you know...<br>  <br>  Anyway, the context of slavery is different in the Bible.  If you recall, God had Moses free the Jews from slavery.  Slavery (in the context you're thinking of) is something Jews experienced first-hand, and many of their practices are designed to remember what it was they were delivered from.<br>  As far as the general Biblical context of a "slave", this was where someone would labor to pay off a debt.  That person was considered a slave.  A "Slave" in the Bible is not the same as a "Slave" picking cotton in America...or a Jewish slave in Egypt.

The turban is generally worn over a haircut. <br>  <br>  Even the 'Khalsa's who keep the hair will reject 3 other physical symbols. For convenience sake - without batting an eyelid. Ask a religious 'Khalsa', - if you take so much trouble over maintaining your hair at the right length, do you keep ‚Äòthe Kacha‚Äô ( large undergarment / drawers ) or do you wear a Calvein Klein brand of underwear. Do you keep ‚Äòthe Kanga‚Äô ( comb ) of the right length or only a miniature Kanga ‚Äì for convenience sake ?

Most bedwetting children are simply delayed in developing the ability to stay dry and have no other developmental issues.<br>  <br>  Genetics - Bedwetting has a strong genetic component. Children whose parents were not enuretic have only a 15% incidence of bedwetting. When one or both parents were bedwetters, the rates jump to 44% and 77% respectively. Genetic research shows that bedwetting is associated with the genes on chromosomes 13q and 12q (possibly 5 and 22 also).<br>  <br>  Infection/disease - Infections and disease are more strongly connected with secondary nocturnal enuresis and with daytime wetting. Less than 5% of all bedwetting cases are caused by infection or disease, the most common of which is a urinary tract infection.<br>  <br>  Physical abnormalities - Less than 10% of enuretics have urinary tract abnormalities, such as a smaller than normal bladder. Current data does support increased bladder tone in some enuretics, which functionally would decrease bladder capacity.<br>  <br>  Insufficient anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) production - A portion of bedwetting children do not produce enough of the anti-diuretic hormone. As explained above, the body normally increases ADH hormone levels at night, signalling the kidneys to produce less urine. The diurnal change may not be seen until about age 10.<br>  <br>  Psychological - Psychological issues (e.g., death in the family, sexual abuse, extreme bullying) are established as a cause of secondary nocturnal enuresis (a return to bedwetting), but are very rarely a cause of PNE-type bedwetting. When Enuresis is caused by a psychological disorder, the bedwetting is considered a symptom of the disorder. Enuresis does have a psychological diagnosis code (see previous section), but it is not considered a psychological condition itself.<br>  <br>  Constipation - Chronic constipation can cause bedwetting. When the bowels are full, it can put pressure on the bladder.<br>  <br>  Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Children with ADHD are 2.7 times more likely to have bedwetting issues.<br>  <br>  Caffeine - Caffeine increases urine production<br>  <br>  Alcohol Consumption - Alcohol increases urine production.[Probably not valid for your son but has to be taken into consideration<br>  <br>  More severe neurological-developmental issues - Patients with mental handicaps, such as Down syndrome, have a higher rate of bedwetting problems. One study of seven-year-olds showed that "handicapped and mentally retarded children," had a bedwetting rate almost three times higher than non-handicapped children (26.6% vs. 9.5%, respectively).<br>  <br>  Sleep apnea - Sleep apnea stemming from an upper airway obstruction has been associated with bedwetting. Snoring and enlarged tonsils or adenoids are a sign of potential sleep apnea problems.<br>  ---------------------------------<br>  <br>  These are just SOME problems that can cause betwetting. Do yourself a favour; get over your pride (you shouldn't be embarrased about buying your son diapers) and GET HIM TO THE DOCTORS.|`|43d91cfdd744257cf8515eeb9273f0c6aa	TROLL<br>  <br>   My son goes into the army in two weeks.

For example if you have a dream of being naked at school it doesn't mean it happened before, it might mean you're afraid of people seeing the real you. The list goes on but only you can interpret your dreams.

It's dependent on the dreamer himself/herself. That is to say, concepts in dreams represent feelings *you* have. To interpret the concept, you must ask *yourself* what feelings those concepts evoke in you, and then figure out what, in real life, gives you that *same feeling*. Then you'll know THAT'S what the concept represents.<br>  <br>  In your example, you dream about someone advising you to rub a penny and a screw together. What feeling does that evoke in you? Fear? Trepidation? Excitement? Confusion?  Accomplishment?  <br>  <br>  Is there anything in your current life that is causing you that same exact feeling? Are you feeling confused about advice someone gave you? Do you associate pennies or screws with anything?  Small, insignificant things?  Something you have in abundance?  Do you have any particular concerns lately about such things?  Does the act of rubbing these items together evoke some kind of feeling for you?  The merging of certain things in your life?  The friction between certain things in your life?  Whatever is going on in your life right now that is causing you that same emotional turmoil or ambivalence or excitement or feeling is what the concepts in the dream represent.<br>  <br>  The answer to what the images in your dream represent lies in those questions, and only you know the answers to those questions.  Answer those questions for yourself and, bingo, you'll have the answer to what the imagery in your dream represents.|`|LtAVf2sLaa	Merry meet to you from sisters of the north.

17138e4727c84e53ff9423f70e878cb9aa	The best way to write in a certain style is to read many books and letters written in that style. A librarian can help you find exactly the kind of book you want. If you want letters and diary entries, there are many in this style. (Librarians love to help people in exactly this way, and they've been trained to find the kind of books you need.) Tell the librarian you're interested in writing letters in a Victorian style. Who knows, there might even be a book that tells you how to do that.<br>  <br>  Victorians wrote tons of letters, many published. After reading these letters for a couple of hours, you'll get the vocabulary, phrasing, and patterns in your ears and in your brain and it will be easier to write in that style. It might also be a good idea to read some poetry of that era to get even more of a feel for how people expressed deep feelings -- what words and phrases they used. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA11666050	Who are the Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj?<br>  <br>  by Mohammed Ali Ibn Zubair Ali<br>  <br>  The Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj<br>  <br>  During the reign of Hadhrat Isa (A.S.) people will live an extremely peaceful life filled with prosperity and abundance. Then the wall which imprisons Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj will break and they will surge forth in large numbers.<br>  <br>  "But when Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj are let loose and they rush headlong down every hill" (Quran 21:97) <br>  <br>  Who are the Ya'jooj and Majooj?<br>  <br>  Zul Qarnain (A.S.) who was a pious and just Ruler travelled to many lands and conquered them, establishing justice and the Law of Allah therein. Allah Ta'ala provided him with all forms and material strength through which he was able to carry out his conquests and missions.<br>  <br>  He once carried out a mission in three directions, the far west, the far east, and then in a northerly direction. It was here that he came across a tribe of people who complained to him about the tribes of Ya'jooj and Majooj which inhabited the land behind two huge mountains and often emerged from behind these mountains to perpetrate acts of anarchy and plunder among them. They requested Zul Qarnain (A.S.) to erect a barrier between themselves and the tribes of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj so that they could be saved from their atrocities. With the material strength at his disposal, Zul Qarnain (A.S.) enlisted their physical labor and set about erecting a high wall between the two mountains. The height of the wall or its exact length is unknown. What is known is that the height of this wall reaches that of the summit of both mountains. It is made with blocks or sheets of iron, which is further strengthened by molten lead. In this manner Ya'jooj and Majooj are unable to scale the wall, or cross it, except when it is the will of Allah.<br>  <br>  "And when the promise of my Rabb approaces, He will level it to dust" (Quran 18:98) <br>  <br>  They are situated in a land of ice which is hidden from our gazes and the exact location of which is unknown. Though many interpretations do exist in this respect, none of these can be said to absolute.<br>  <br>  Ya'jooj and Majooj are human beings and according to a narration they are from the progeny of Yafith ibn Nooh (A.S.).<br>  <br>  Some Ahadith...<br>  <br>  In a lengthy hadith by Hadhrat Nawwas ibn Sam'aan (R.A.) Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) is reported to have said:<br>  <br>  "...Allah will send revelation upon Eesa (A.S.) that 'Such a creation of mine is now going to emerge that no power will be able to stop them. Therefore take my servants and ascend the Mount of Toor.' Then Ya'jooj and Majooj will emerge and surge forth in all their fury. When those from among them who constitute the former part of their army pass the lake of Tiberias (which is in northern Palestine), they will drink up all the water of that lake and by the time those that constitute the latter part of that same army pass the lake, they will say, "There used to be water here (long ago). When they reach the Mount of Khamr in Jerusalem, they will arrogantly proclaim: 'We have conquered the people of the earth, now we will annihilate those in the sky.' So saying they will fire their arrows towards the sky. When the arrows return to the ground they will be blood stained.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, Eesa (A.S.) will be on the Mount of Toor with his followers. At that time the head of and ox will be as valuable as is a hundred dinars to you in this day. [This indicates the scarcity of provisions]. Faced with these hardships, Eesa (A.S.) and his followers will make dua unto Allah (to remove this calamity). As a result, Allah will cause sores to appear on the necks of each and every individual of these people which will cause their death suddenly. When Eesa (A.S.) and his followers descend from the Mount of Toor there will not be a single space on the land where the dead rotting bodies of these people is not littered, giving off a horrendous odour. Eesa (A.S.) and his followers will once more supplicate unto Allah as a result of which Allah will send down huge birds whose necks will be as thick as that of the necks of camels, and they will dump these bodies in a place where Allah wills. (According to a narration by Tirmidhi, they will be dumped at a place called Nahbal).<br>  <br>  Allah Ta'ala will then send down a heavy rain, the waters of which will flow in every part of the earth cleansing it thoroughly. It will rain for a period of forty days.<br>  <br>  The Muslims will then burn the bows and arrows of the Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj for a period of seven years.<br>  <br>  Allah will order the earth to yield forth its crops in abundance and there will be such blessing and prosperity that one pomegranate will be sufficient for a whole group while the peel thereof will suffice to cast a shadow over them. The milk of one camel will be sufficient for many groups while one milk giving cow will be sufficient for a whole tribe. One milk giving goat will be sufficent for a whole family..."<br>  <br>  (Muslim)<br>  <br>  Hadhrat Abu Saeed Khudri (R.A.) narrates that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said:<br>  <br>  "On the day of Qiyamah Allah will say to Adam (A.S.) to pick out the Jahannamis from his entire progeny. Adam (A.S.) will ask: 'O Rabb, who are they?'<br>  <br>  Allah will say: 'Nine hundred and ninety nine of a thousand are Jahannami while the one is a Jannati.'<br>  <br>  On hearing this the Sahaba were overtaken by fear and they asked "O Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam), who will that one Janniti be?'<br>  <br>  Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said: 'Do not grieve, the nine hundred and ninety nine will be Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj while you will be the Jannati."' (i.e. your numbers in relation to them will be one in a thousand).<br>  <br>  (Bukhari and Muslim)<br>  <br>  Hadhrat Abdullah ibn Umar (R.A.) says that Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) said:<br>  <br>  "Allah Ta'ala divided mankind into ten parts. Nine tenths constitute Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj while the remaining tenths constitutues the rest of mankind."<br>  <br>  Hadhrat Zainab bint Jahsh (R.A.) says: "...once Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wassallam) awoke from such a sleep that his face was red and these words were on his tongue: 'There is none worthy of worship except Allah. Destruction is upon the Arabs on account of the evil which has come close to them. Today a hole as big as this has opened up in the wall of Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj.' ..and Rasulullah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) indicated the size of the hole forming a ring with his index finger and thumb."<br>  <br>  (Bukhari and Muslim)<br>  <br>  Hadhrat Abu Hurairah (R.A.) narrates that every day Ya'jooj and Ma'jooj break (dig) through the wall erected by Zul Qarnain (A.S.) until they reach the end of it to that extent that they can actually see the light on the other side. They then return (home) saying that 'We will break through tomorrow.' But Allah Ta'ala causes the wall to revert to its original thickness and the next day they start digging through the wall all over again, and this process continues each day until as long as Allah wills them to remain imprisoned. When Allah wishes them to be released, then at the end of the day they will say, "If Allah wills, tomorrow we will break through." The following day they will find the wall as they had left it the previous day (i.e. it will not have returned to its orginal state) and after breaking the remaining part of it they will emerge."<br>  <br>  (Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah)<br>  <br>  Commenting on the above hadith, Allamah Ibn Arabi says, Three miracles are evident in this Hadith:<br>  <br>  1.) It never occurs to these tribes that they must continue work during the night. After all, they are in such large numbers that they can easily delegate the work among themselves and work in shifts. But Allah does not allow this thought to occur to them.<br>  <br>  2.) It never occurs to them that they can merely cross the mountains or scale the wall, which they can do through the aid of equipment and implements wich they possess in large numbers. According to a narration by Wahab ibn Munabbah it is known that these tribes are agriculturists and artisians possessing various types of equipment.<br>  <br>  3.) The thought of saying "If Allah wills" never enters their minds and it will only occur to them to say it when Allah wills that they be released.<br>  <br>  from: "Signs of Qiyamah"<br>  by Mohammed Ali Ibn Zubair Ali|`|082cdcaafceb865640ada7232d719510aa	Gog and Magog are two ancient oaks at the bottom of Glastonbury Tor in England.

cc1ba6b0728cacb0aa2b8c20c0cb48f6aa	I'm a little confused because you didn't say if one hand was better at doing any of these things than the other.  I can write fine with my left hand but I'm MUCH faster with my right.  I can do a lot of things left handed without much of a problem but my right hand works much better so I'm "right handed".   You're not considered truly ambidextrous if you favor one hand for most "precise fine motor skill operations", usually writing (some musical instruments don't count, like violin)  <br>  <br>  Mixed-handedness is if different hands are better at different tasks.  If you write and sew better with your left hand but brush your teeth and eat better with the right, you might be called "mixed-handed".  But most people would say you were left handed since the fine motor skills were performed better with your left hand. You could call some of these people "ambidextrous with a left preference" (or right preference) <br>  <br>  One 1962 poll found that 2% of people called themselves 'ambidextrous'.  A 1992 survey found only 1% claimed to be.  Many of the people who were polled still favored the left hand.  It is more common for left handed people to have some control over their right hand than vice versa.  They are not considered truly ambidextrous unless they can perform ALL tasks equally with both hands without favoring one over the other.  Everything I've read says this is "very rare".|`|f6bada5d0498c139dc0eb8fe4a916963aa	1.6%

Cosa succederebbe, direbbero le brave madri, se il bambino, cos√¨ piccolo, di 7 o 8 anni, cominciasse non solo a scoprire ante naturalitatem il sesso, ma ad interrogarsi sul sesso malvagio, sui pedofili, sugli abusi? Ne avrebbe paura, sarebbe spaventato.. no! Non si puo'. E poi queste tematiche non si possono far capire a dei piccoli fanciulli, loro sono creature cos√¨ innocenti, non si puo' violentare la loro verginit√† spirituale.<br>  <br>  E indovina un po' come mai tutte queste reticenze da parte dei benpensanti a parlare di sesso ai bambini? Come mai lo considerano un argomento tab√π e pensano che si potrebbero spaventare, quando poi il telegiornale dove muoiono in guerra e di fame lo possono invece guardare?<br>  Perch√® il sesso √® cosa sporca che violenterebbe le loro piccole menti vergini?<br>  Beh, questo √® il gioco dell'indovina chi. Indovina chi √® che ha promosso questa cultura e questa socialit√† nei secoli?<br>  La societ√†? Si, fuochino, ma chi la consigliava? E allora un'altra volta si deve partire anche dal principio e andare a rompere le scatole laddove questa credenza √® annidata da secoli per fare un po' di chiarezza. Ci siamo capiti vero?<br>  :)<br>  beh, ciao e non smettere di lottare, te che puoi.<br>  <br>  Beh.. meno male che non volevo risponderti..|`|57357bb0829a8e656d4db1810684c6efaa	ho visto 2 giorni fa un documentario sulla chiesa e la pedofilia che faceva accapponare la pelle, pare che i preti cattolici in america ne abbiano combinate di tutti i colori e dalle registrazioni dicevano cose del tipo "fare sesso con me √® una prova che dio ti ama, perch√® io sono un prete" oppure "il sesso anale non √® peccato perch√® non ci pu√≤ essere concepimento". il papa precedente lott√≤ contro la pedofilia, mentre quello attuale si preoccupa di + delle coppie di fatto. Purtroppo mancano le strutture in italia e l'informazione per aiutare chi subisce un abuso. A roma basta uscire di casa e si trovano ovunque prostitute giovanissime e che si pu√≤ fare? posso forse imporgli di togliersi dalla strada? √®  difficile da debellare , ma gi√† parlarne  √® un inizio|`|78fd6a82f95ab0b91e0585f9eb4d4721aa	perch√® esite il tab√π! gi√† √® tanto che parlano di presevativi... cmq senti in america hanno messo in testa ai ragazzetti che √® necessario avere armi in tasca per difendersi.... e poi vanno ad uccidere 30 dei propri compagni..........lo  sai cosa hanno avuto il coraggio di dire "quel ragazzo √® pazzo".... secondo te perch√® √® diventato pazzo?? ecco questo bisogna chiedersi. quindi parlare di struppo nelle scuole ad esempio √® controproducente da una parte perch√® √® ingiusto incutere terrore a delle povere bambine....piuttosto smettiamola di far vedere loro la tv (compresi certi cartoni) che istigano alla violenza....cos√¨ si educa! senza mass media il mondo era diverso....ma fosse solo questo il problema!!|`|27594266d1e57157481b18fbd5d61ad1aa	Hai ragione, ma delle volte qua... chiama pi√π attenzione una domanda  leggera!!

Sai quante madri sanno che il marito abusa di una figlia e se ne stanno zitte? Le ragazzine che prendono il coraggio a quattro mani e decidono di denunciare il padre, magari alle proprie insegnanti, sono una percentuale minima, perch√© i padri esercitano su di loro o terrorismo psicologico o addirittura violenza fisica e a quell'et√† la paura √® difficile da superare. Comunque se hai da proporre qualsiasi iniziativa che possa aiutare questi bambini io sono con te. Ciao.

Sie haben keine eigenen Ideen mehr und wissen nicht wie sie sich besch?ftigen sollen. Mal ein Spiel spielen finde ich ja ok, aber als Dauerzustand w?re das nichts. Ich denke, dass es auch viel damit zu tun hat, dass die Eltern Hartz4 bekommen. Man sieht ja oft im Fernsehen das Kinder kein ordentliches Mittagessen bekommen k?nnen, weil die Eltern kein Geld haben. Man muss sich in vielen Dingen einschr?nken. Man hat keine tollen Klamotten und man kann nicht mal in einen Tierpark gehen, weil das alles zu teuer wird. Wenn man nicht mal den Kindern ein Eis kaufen kann. Dann finde ich das schon traurig. Kinder leiden sehr darunter, auch wenn sie es nicht immer zeigen. Eltern k?nnen ihren Kindern nicht viel bieten und sind selber am Ende. Wie soll man dann noch ordentlich erziehen k?nnen und sich um die k√ºmmern, wenn man nicht wei? wie es weiter gehen soll.|`|fBbXQmOFaa	Weil ihnen ihre Umwelt eine Scheinwelt vorlebt in denen Gef√ºhle im positiven Sinne nicht vorkommen. <br>  Kinder werden doch schon oft im Kleinkindalter vor den Fernseher gesetzt damit die Eltern mal "f√ºnf" Minuten Ruhe haben. Das Kinderprogramm ist leider auch nicht immer gewaltfrei. Dann kommt eine Spielekonsole dazu und irgendwer schenkt ein Spiel bei den es ziemlich r√ºde zugeht.<br>  Streit im Elternhaus, Schulprobleme, zu wenig Kommunikation im Elternhaus.

Es geht mehr um finanzielle Dinge, Kinder bekommen von Anfang an mit, dass man am besten einfach nur "funktionieren" soll. Oft werden auch die Kinder so behandelt: Sie sollen m?glichst ruhig sein und sich irgendwie besch?ftigen. Sie werden vor dem Fernseher oder Computer "geparkt", es dreht sich mehr um neues Spielzeug, Handy und Co. Nur Geld ist wichtig, wirklichen Familienzusammenhalt erfahren sich kaum.<br>  <br>  Manchmal gibt es nicht einmal eine richtige Familie (das ist heute deutlich h?ufiger als fr√ºher). Es gibt wechselnde Partner, Vater und Mutter leben nicht zusammen, Stiefeltern und Co. Es fehlt eine Best?ndigkeit, ein dauerhaftes / sicheres Umfeld, in dem man seinen Emotionen freien Lauf lassen kann. Kinder k?nnen kein richtiges Vertrauen aufbauen und es fehlt ihnen die Sicherheit, wenn die Verh?ltnisse so "undurchschaubar" oder immer wieder anders sind.<br>  <br>  Insgesamt ist die Gesellschaft nicht gerade kinderfreundlich eingestellt. Damit meine ich nicht die Dinge, die von "staatlicher" Seite kommen, sondern den Stellenwert, den Kinder einnehmen. Sie sollen sich gef?lligst ruhig verhalten, immer das machen, was man von ihnen verlangt und R√ºcksicht auf die Erwachsenen nehmen. Das ist fast schon milit?rischer Drill, statt verst?ndnisvoll. Umgekehrt bietet man den Kindern aber kaum etwas... okay, vielleicht tolle Spielzeuge und Dinge, die sie haben m?chten, aber wenig Zeit und kaum die Sicherheit, die sie eigentlich br?uchten.

(Hch 1:9.) No se quiere decir que los disc√≠pulos vieran a Jes√∫s alejarse sobre una nube, sino que la nube ocult√≥ de su vista a Jes√∫s. Este hecho ayuda a entender las palabras de Jes√∫s en relaci√≥n con el tiempo de su presencia, pues dijo: "Ver√°n al Hijo del hombre viniendo en una nube con poder y gran gloria", y "Viene con las nubes, y todo ojo le ver√°". (Lu 21:27; Mt 24:30; Rev 1:7.)  las nubes representaron una presencia invisible, que los observadores pod√≠an "ver" con su "percepci√≥n" mental., se producir√≠an acontecimientos que, al "verlos", permitir√≠an a las personas observadoras percibir la presencia invisible de Cristo.

f97646c6f656f57833354bfee6669662aa	That's a good question. For some reason unbeknownst to me, Christ's birth has been mingled with the gift-giving holiday.<br>  <br>  However, what really has drawn my attention was when I found out today the real origins of Easter (the egg part of it). Eostre was a pagan god worshipped before biblical times. One aspect of Eostre was the giving of life, especially eggs. Even though Christians only do egg hunts because it has been commericalized...it is still a pagan ritual. Interesting stuff.<br>  <br>  But I do celebrate the real reason for those seasons: Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior.

Il grandioso universo, la sua bellezza e il suo ordine, l‚Äôabbondanza e la variet√† della vita vegetale e animale, l‚Äôuomo stesso, tutto addita l‚Äôesistenza di un magistrale Progettista, di un Creatore della vita e della materia. In base a quello che possono vedere, milioni di persone riflessive in tutto il mondo hanno pure riconosciuto certe qualit√† di Dio. Sono d‚Äôaccordo con l‚Äôispirato apostolo Paolo: Le ‚Äúinvisibili qualit√† [di Dio] .?.?. si vedono chiaramente .?.?. perch√© si comprendono dalle cose fatte‚Äù. ‚Äî?Rom. 1:20; Atti 14:16,?17.<br>  <br>  Personalmente preferisco questa realt√†. <br>  La facolt√† umana della coscienza √® solo un esempio di questa verit√†. La Bibbia mostra che questa facolt√†, questa intima consapevolezza o senso del bene e del male, √® la prova di una ‚Äòlegge scritta nel cuore‚Äô. (Rom. 2:14,?15) Ovviamente l‚Äôumanit√† non ottenne tale ‚Äúlegge‚Äù dagli animali bruti, poich√© fra loro non se ne vede l‚Äôoperato. L‚Äôesistenza di questa ‚Äúlegge‚Äù interiore mostra che dev‚Äôesserci un Legislatore intelligente, Dio. Inoltre, questa facolt√† rivela la sapienza e il grande interesse e amore del Creatore per l‚Äôuomo. La coscienza dell‚Äôuomo √® servita a scoraggiare atti che minacciano la vita, il benessere e l‚Äôincolumit√† del genere umano. La facolt√† della coscienza condanna normalmente gli stessi mali in ogni tempo e luogo. Anche senza alcun ‚Äòcodice di leggi‚Äô scritto, in tutta la storia gli uomini hanno riconosciuto che assassinio, furto, adulterio e perversione sessuale sono cose errate. Questa innata conoscenza ha dato una certa stabilit√† alla societ√† umana, specialmente alla disposizione familiare. (Gen. 34:7; 39:9; Giobbe capitolo?31; 2?Piet. 2:6,?7) La facolt√† della coscienza √® veramente il dono di un Dio onnisapiente e amorevole.<br>  <br>  .|`|JUjvF6pmaa	io ci credo.|`|QcXA7zHdaa	Proprio ieri sera, col film "Inchiesta", abbiamo avuto un'altra prova che Ges√π √® realmente esistito( ci sono troppi riferimenti storici).

The Bible does not oppose those things. . .evolution, age of earth. . . I find that they can go along with my beliefs with no fault. Does the Bible say God did absolutely not create man through evolution?  Does it say that those 6 days were 24 hour days?  No. . .and God did not create the stars to govern the day and night until the 3rd day (I believe), but there was light and darkness before He made the stars and the great stars.  Who can know how long those 'days' were?  Who saw God create it?  We will not know in full until we dwell with Him.|`|1gL5S4GZaa	God did create every living thing and science to explain it.

God did not sit and whisper in Darwin's ear, "man evolved from monkeys and everything evolved from slime that crawled out of the ocean." Man is naturally curious. We always want explanations to why things are the way they are. Someone looked at monkeys and said, "look, they've got thumbs like us," and decided that explained our existence. God did not necessarily create science; man created science in order to explain the things around him.|`|Z5d9XslYaa	There are many Scientists, that have been converted by what they have learned..from the way your question has been stated, it seems that you think Science is seperate from God..all spirits, for instance, are electromagneticly based, and exist in different demensions..the existence of demensions was proved when anti-matter was formed using Super-Colliders...An advanced form of Cloning was described, when it said in Genisis, that Eve was formed by God taking one of Adam`s ribs, and using the material from that, Eve was made...How in the world would an old Hebrew know anything about Cloning? Yet they originated that account...Knowledgable Christains just reject science that is faulty, or incomplete....after all....where`s the fossil evidence that can produce a half Neanderthal-half Homo Sapiens skeleton?....if Evolution was correct, there should have been thousands of half and halves, fossil-wise, that should`ve been in existence by now.|`|cPARl0q2aa	Evolution is not a science. Evolution defies mathematical probability. Evolution defies second law of thermodynamics. <br>  <br>  Evolution claims, random change & natural selection make simple things spontaneously transform into more complex things without recourse to intelligent design. Chance and random changes simply do not produce higher levels of organization & complexity.<br>  <br>  How ridiculously impossible it is MATHEMATICALLY, for 'order' - of the magnitude of the human brain and DNA - to come from absolute disorder? How could TIME alone account for the order in the universe, natural laws, complex organisms, etc.?|`|L6E6lDGKaa	We don't oppose it at all. First of all, science has never proved one theory over another. Take a close look at all the new scientific finds, such as the recently proposed new earth-like planet, and tell me where even one ounce of proof exists that discredits the bible. All the evidence is the same and people with agendas will form it to fit their belief. I personally enjoy all the findings but I am not persuaded by what the scientists claim the findings represent. Too much speculation considering how they trash any idea that does not agree with their speculation. Talk about narrow minded. The day that slam dunk evidence proves God wrong, I'll admit following a lie. But you have to admit, if it's gone this long without that happening, it seems that the chances of ever finding that type of evidence will never come about. And that's why I have total confidence in the beliefs I have. All the brilliant minds of men in this world and they are but folly before God.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	What makes you think that "all" Christians are opposed to science? I'll be the first Christian to admit that I don't have all the answers. I also don't claim to know how everything began or where it's all headed. I'm more than willing to consider all the possibilities. <br>  <br>  The only time I have a problem with science is when someone presents a theory as if it was proven fact or treats that theory as if it is the only explanation to the exclusion of all other possibilities. Other than that, I welcome scientific advancement and exploration.|`|36255811eb0cea1d4bac4b2e63d27377aa	Yes indeed, God did give us science, my problem is when science, based on assumptions and probabilities, tries to prove God out of existence.

Come on, some christians might not think on it but some christians do. <br>  <br>  Not all of us are opposed to science, it's kinda offensive for me since personally I enjoy science a lot and God.

bdb3182eca6f91618de63780ef940397aa	The word Amen (Tiberian Hebrew ????? ‚ÄôAmen "So be it; truly", Standard Hebrew ??? Amen, Arabic ???? ‚ÄôƒÅmƒ´n, Ge'ez' ??? ‚ÄôƒÅmƒìn) is a declaration of affirmation found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and in the Qur'an. It has always been in use within Judaism and Islam. It has been generally adopted in Christian worship as a concluding formula for prayers and hymns. In Islam, it is the standard ending to Dua (Supplication). Common English translations of the word amen include: "Verily", "Truly", "So be it", and "Let it be". Colloquially, it can also mean "I agree," or "Well said."|`|5a5a587925ecd245838b8446f97300fbaa	A large crowd of  women were by the well,the village had no men.Suddenly out of the well arose 2 men the women were elated,in their accents derived Amen which means 2 men in Swaheely.

The best thing would be a decongestant. Psuedofedrine (sp?)  is the best one. You can get that at the pharmacy, and it's in claratin D. It's now considered a controlled substance, so you have to show ID to get it, but it works. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend putting anything in the ear unless the pharamicist tells you too!!

If the ear infection spreads it could become dangerous and it could also affect your hearing. I worked with a woman (I swear this is a true story) she had a sinus infection and could not afford a doctor. She let it go and it the infection spread causing swelling of her brain. She was in the hospital for almost a month.  In Michigan some stores have begun giving antibiotics for free with a prescription (Meijer) and Wal-Mart only charges a dollar. Good luck.

6758c821b132686ab57ec075ec135491aa	Everything that is written in the bible can be resumed in one word: LOVE.<br>  So I don't need to read the bible to prove that I love God and His Son Jesus.|`|2WOFpd12aa	Given that widespread availability of the Bible did not occur for quite some time, it seems a little silly to view the reading of every word of it some kind of litmus test.<br>  <br>  It is not so much disrespect as failing to take advantage of an opportunity.  But over-reliance on the Bible has similar problems - through the Bible we learn that Jesus often took himself away from the hustle to meditate / pray / communicate with God.  So it is a similar "failure" to read the Bible, make an appearance each week in church and not set aside time where you and God can connect.  It is a failure not to connect with other followers.  It is a failure to miss opportunities to spread the Word.  It is a failure to not use your time and talents well.<br>  <br>  Jesus had a simple message: Love God and each other - from those two everything else follows.  You cannot honestly attempt to follow those two commandments and fail to be attempting to follow the ten commandments - even if you are ignorant of them.<br>  <br>  Finally, God gives us so many gifts that we inevitably "turn our back".  How many times are we ungrateful when we should be grateful?  How many times do we neglect our gifts (family, friends, health, etc.)?  I say this not to discourage reading the Bible (it warns us of all the ways we can fail) - but because the question implies superiority.  To those who diligently read the Bible (as I do), I'd suggest we look at where we continue to fail instead of how others fail.<br>  <br>  That being said, everyone - go read your Bibles, hopefully with other seekers!|`|68fd562bcc726b3ad41ca79d43597ce4aa	Believe me.

People who say they experience astral projection often say that their consciousness or soul has transferred into an astral body (or "double"), which moves in tandem with the physical body in a "parallel world" known as the astral plane. The concept of astral projection has been around for thousands of years, dating back to ancient China.[citation needed] It is currently often associated with the New Age movement.<br>  <br>  <br>  Within the modern system of Thelema, developed by Aleister Crowley in the first half of the 20th century, Thelemic mysticism is a complex mystical path designed to do two interrelated things: to learn one's unique True Will and to achieve union with the All. The set of techniques for doing so falls under Crowley's term Magick, which draws upon various existing disciplines and mystical models, including Yoga, Western ceremonial ritual (especially invocations and eucharistic ceremony), the Qabalah, and several divination systems, especially the tarot and astrology.<br>  <br>  The path to mystical attainment or enlightenment was initially developed by Crowley largely based on the meditation/mystical techniques found in Buddhism and also the Tree of Life, especially as it was examined by Eliphas Levi in the 19th century and later by various members in the occult society, the Golden Dawn. In 1904, Crowley wrote The Book of the Law, which he eventually called the central sacred text of Thelema, heralding a new Aeon for mankind. Between 1907 and 1911, Crowley wrote a series of other small texts which he considered to be "inspired" in that they were written through him rather than by him, which were afterwards collected together and termed the Holy Books. The final text added to the list was The Vision and the Voice, a vivid account of Crowley's astral travels through the thirty Enochian Aethyrs. These texts formed the final mystical backbone of Crowley's system.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_projection" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astral_proj...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelemic_mysticism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelemic_my...</a>|`|177d18bcc551489f20ac5980bc53b55baa	It's just a 9th level wizard spell; no big deal.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, or that it isn't possible that you don't go somewhere when you "leave" your body, but it's the same process, and seems to more or less by hypnotising one's self and convincing one's self one is elsewhere to an outside observer...<br>  <br>  But no, it's not so dangerous, despite what one might tell you about the harm that can come to one in the astral plane, that'd be mostly superstition.  There has never been a documented medical/psychological case of this happening at very least, which would suggest that if you are harmed, you cease to have ever existed.|`|egO3olzmaa	Check out "The Witch's Bible" by Janet and Stewart Farrar (sp???) from your library.. It has a great deal of legitimate info about astral projection. What you need to do is visualize yourself from an outside perspective. Sitting in a chair in front of a mirror helps.

Uhm, seg√∫n lo que he le√≠do, no, s√≥lo pueden perturbarnos mas no "apoderarse" de nosotros o despojarnos de nuestro esp√≠ritu, he leido de casos en los que estas larvas o par√°sitos conviven dentro de una persona, pero no s√© qu√© tan cierto sea eso. <br>  Y los mensajes, claro, as√≠ como los mensajes que te llegan en los sue?os (por cierto que el estado en el que so?amos es el estado m√°s pr√≥ximo al astral).<br>  <br>  Espero no haberte aburrido con tanta explicaci√≥n, m√°s s√≠ haberte dado algo m√°s de informaci√≥n ;)<br>  <br>  melissa.|`|v9GWgj3Yaa	nunca escuche de SAN CIERTO .<br>  <br>  no todo eso que te contaron son mentiras.<br>  en tu cuerpo solo deber√≠a de haber espacio para el Esp√≠ritu Santo, lo que si es cierto es que si tu lo permites pueden entrar esp√≠ritus demoniacos a tu cuerpo y te podr√≠an inducir a actuar de una manera ajena a tu voluntad, por eso es que miras a tantas personas con muy malos  actos.<br>  El acecino, el violador, el ladr√≥n el mentiroso, etc. en su interior no quicieran actuar de esa manera pero est√°n pose√≠dos por esp√≠ritus de satan√°s, es necesario que esos esp√≠ritus que los atormentan sean expulsados  en el nombre de Jesucristo y puedan ser libres.

Le accoglie San Pietro, che per√≤ deve ammonirle per qualche comportamento scorretto avuto durante l'esistenza in vita. - "Allora, Suor Germana, vedo qui sul registro che quando avevi 17 anni hai visto di nascosto il pisello del tuo parroco. Se sei pentita, lavati le palpebre nell'Acqua Santa e le porte del Paradiso ti si apriranno per l'eternit√†!" - La suora ubbidisce e viene beatificata. - "Tu, invece, Suor Fabiana, vedo che a 20 anni hai toccato il pisello del parroco. Lavati le mani nell'Acqua Santa." - La seconda suora ubbidisce ed entra. - "E tu invece, suor Gabriella..." - A quel punto interviene suor Lucia: "A San Pie', te dispiace se mi sciacquo la bocca prima che Suor Gabriella si lava il c  ulo?"<br>   <br>  Una donna trova il marito a letto con l'amante, prende un coltello, gli taglia il pisello e lo lancia gi√π dalla finestra.
