vrq2sz5Aaa	I have done it a few  times. my advice is to follow the directions carefully and take your time. Do not try to rush it. If the product you are using requires a solution to apply the tint, do not be afraid of using too much, it is better to use more than less.|`|b431c2b178942e89f6dba145592efe76aa	Well, i am glad that you are trying to save money. But i believe you should stick to the experts.|`|0c5Xupi5aa	well with a bit of care you could easily apply it yourself, and possibly a bit of help from a friend that knows if he screws up your tint that you will stab him in the face with a spork.  That always works.  :D<br>  <br>  Personally I havent done alot to my own car, but on others cars I have done just about everything but that, and vinyls.  Which my friend specializes in so, he does all the tinting and such himself.  Cost so much less, and turns out just as good.  But patience is a key, dont rush it.

wpgRMjgraa	Do the following, take your time and everything will work out perfectly.<br>  <br>  STEERING Steer smoothly whether you are driving straight ahead, turning or backing up.<br>  <br>  ACCELERATION Accelerate smoothly and moderately. Don't race the engine or cause it to stall.<br>  <br>  BRAKING Bring the vehicle to a stop gently. Start braking well before your stopping position to avoid "jerky" stops. Make sure you stop your vehicle in the proper position of the lane.<br>  <br>  CLUTCH/GEAR Always be sure your vehicle is in the correct gear. With either an automatic or a manual transmission, shift into the proper gear at the right time without "grinding" the gears.<br>  <br>  SPEED Obey the posted speed limit, of course, but also adjust your speed properly due to weather, road, visibility and traffic conditions.<br>  <br>  FOLLOWING DISTANCE Keep an adequate space "cushion" between your vehicle and those you are following. Use the "two second rule" described in the Driver's Manual. Be sure to increase your following distance in poor weather or visibility.<br>  <br>  TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES Know the meanings of signs, signals and pavement markings, and obey them consistently.<br>  <br>  STOPPING POSITION If a stop is required, stop your vehicle before it reaches an intersecting street. If stop lines or crosswalks are present, stop before crossing them. If your view is blocked after stopping behind the crosswalk, move up until you can clearly see your way, then stop again if necessary.<br>  <br>  LANE SELECTION AND POSITION Keep your vehicle in the proper traffic lane, especially when preparing to make turns. Don't allow room for another vehicle to pass you on the side that you are turning toward.<br>  <br>  COMMUNICATION Let other drivers and pedestrians know which way you want to go. Use your directional signals or horn consistently and at the proper times.<br>  <br>  OBSERVATION Look for and identify potential problems or hazards in the traffic around you - not just straight ahead, but behind you and on either side. Check your mirrors frequently, but be sure to look over your shoulder behind you when changing lanes or backing up.<br>  <br>  ANTICIPATE & REACT TO OTHERS Anticipate possible driving errors by others and be ready to react safely to make up for their mistakes.<br>  |`|XLXncQu9aa	You have nothing to be concerned with.  Being nervous is completely normal.  When I went for my driving test the first time I was nervous too.  It happens to everyone.  But the key is not to stress about it.  Make sure that you just remain calm.  That is the key here.  Being calm makes it easier to concentrate.  Also try to get practice on the road with your parent.  If you can practice in a parking lot and go over the key movements.  The thing you should not worry about is time.  You can take as much time as you need to on the test, as long as you complete each phase and do it correctly.  If you focus too much on what you might do wrong, then you will fail.  Focus on completing the test, and relaxing.  Don't stress because that is the ultimate way to fail a test.  Also get plenty of sleep before the test, and just take your time during the exam.  You should be fine with a little more practice and more time to relax. |`|M3GDjEHtaa	I live in CA, it wasn't hard at all. I was very nervous also and it was actually pretty short. All you have to do is stay calm and do whatever the instructor tells you but ALWAYS make sure you look before turning or switching lanes. They give you directions but you gotta make sure it's safe to do whatever it is they're asking you to do. It's easy to forget these things when you're there. Good Luck!|`|AA11621397	Hello I just got my full license today (in Canada it's a G which allows you full driving privileges) I was horribly nervous to but then I tried not to psych myself out with fear. I said to myself I am going to do it and do my best. Every time I felt fear creep in during my test I would say to myself mentally "STOP". Be confident and believe in your driving ability and you will succeed. |`|85DgjhiGaa	You will be fine. You sound like your confident in your driving.<br>  <br>  Good luck mate!|`|tLPv8Vvuaa	Don't worry. I've been to NC and the driver's are fairly nice. Much better than Chicago.|`|yINAiYDDaa	It's perfectly normal to be nervous. I know I was a wreck when I had to take my test. If your grandmother is telling you that you are a wonderful driver, I'm sure she's being honest. When it comes time for you to take your test, however, just remember to try to stay as calm as possible, but don't be overconfident! That can sometimes lead into some serious mistakes! I'll pretty much be repeating what everybody else is saying, but just follow your instructor's directions and be alert! Try driving 5 miles below the speed limit, just to make sure you don't miss any stop signs...or anybody else. Hehe, kidding. Always pay attention to those stop signs. My instructor was tough on that. Always go into a complete stop. Take your time on those. There's absolutely no rush, and plus you'll be able to see who has the right of way. Always remember to look both ways. Remember what you need to do when you switch lanes. I'm sure you'll do fine and won't have anything to worry about. Good luck!!|`|KcVBmhLmaa	Listen buddy this is a big secret and i guarantee u it will work.<br>  <br>  Listen, u can try VISUALIZING yourself (in ur mind) driving a car for the "Driver license test", and make the pictures moving in ur mind just the way u like it and want it to be.(While u are visualizing make sure you pass the test real simple).

l5ClLY8qaa	    SUBARU is a very reliable car that is 4 wheel drive.|`|9b8955c587bca8960062ebd22cce1e03aa	That's an easy question to answer.<br>  <br>  The most economical vehicle under $5,000 would be the Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick with 2-Doors, either convertible or hardtop. I had one of the Geos with a 16-Valve I-4 and 4-Wheel Drive and a removeable fiberglass top, and averaged 32 miles per gallon if I took it easy on the highway (about 65 miles per hour). They're also pretty good off-road, but I would recommend lifting them up to increase ground clearance.<br>  <br>  Another good choice, but much harder to find, would be the Daihatsu Rocky and Suzuki Samurai, which are even smaller, so I'd suspect that gas mileage is slightly better.<br>  <br>  If you can find one, another smart choice would be the Toyota RAV4 Cabriolet with All-Wheel Drive, which is also a similar vehicle.<br>  <br>  All the vehicle's I've listed above are from the 1990s, so they should be pretty cheap (my Geo was $3,200 in very good shape with 86,000 miles.).<br>  <br>  I hope this has answered your question. If you have any more, please feel free to ask.

Now at 200,000 it is very tired and needs alot of work.  I will replace it shortly.  When you buy a used minivan, watchout for people like me who used its capability and utility beyond what it was designed for.  I just plan to give mine to charity as it is not worth much- I used it up.  But still think it served me well.
INFrOMiLaa	If you opt for a high performance carburetor, it can improve your performance a little bit. Check with a mechanic, and find out if a high performance carb is available for your Golf. If you increase the CFM rating (cubic feet of air per minute), you will produce a little more HP and torque. So look for a carb that has a higher CFM rating than the stock one that is currently on it. But consult a mechanic first. You can over-carb the engine quite easily. Bigger is not necessarily better.<br>  <br>  If the engine is old and tired, it may need to be rebuilt. How many miles are on it? <br>  <br>  You can also do a tune-up on the car and it will slightly improve throttle response and HP. But once again, have a mechanic inspect your car first and diagnose what the problem is. <br>  <br>  If you can't get an aftermarket carb, you can have your stock one rebuilt. If larger jets are available, you can improve the power a little bit by changing the jets in the carb. You may just need to have the carb cleaned well and rebuilt professionally. Once again, have a mechanic check it out for you. Don't get suckered. You have a right to ask several opinions first before you have any work done. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and Godspeed!|`|1Txrcz3Waa	Heyas..<br>  the 1300 golf is quite underpowered, you could maybe consider dropping in the 1.6 lump (very pokey engine, its the one I had, very torquey :P )<br>  The original Pierburg carbs are utter s**t, so dump it! <br>  I broke down about 15 times or near enough that in the first few weeks of owning the thing!<br>  An upgrade to a 32/36 progressive Weber carb kit is a very common one on these, and very effective.. gives you better mpg, better throttle response, makes it sound a lot more aggressive, and yes, a little more power as well :)<br>  Good luck! <br>  Oh, try big boys toys for the carb kit... www.bigboystoys-uk.com .. all part of VW Heritage now...|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Your Golf IS, as you say, 18 years old! The 1.3 version did not have much oomph even when brand new so it is hardly surprising that it is showing signs of old age now.  Cars of that vintage very often had an adjustable inlet on the air filter with winter and summer settings.  Icing is not likely to be anything to do with how old or used the carb is (some carbs were very prone to this in the winter, a nortorious example being the twin choke Nikki often fitted to various cars as an after market replacement to give a bit more power). If your car has the variable inlet you have obviously left it in the summer position.<br>  <br>  At the age of your car a new, re-furbished or lot newer carb would be a good idea anyway.

You don't buy many cars at auction, do you? Take it to your mechanic and have him check for signs of an accident. Passing smog doesn't prove squat. it may just be a bad sensor. And just because it wasn't issued a salvage title doesn't mean it wasn't crashed and repaired.<br>  <br>  Above all, take it to your mechanic BEFORE you buy it. If they won't let you, walk away.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	tell the seller that you would like your mechanic to take a look at it, then take it to a dealership and have them look at it.

Zbo9Xd0Daa	If you bought this car from a dealership, and they did not title it in your name, something is wrong.  That is the law and part of the "title and licensing" fees.<br>  <br>  Yes it must be in your name, but I would visit the dealer or call and ask why the title was not issued in your name when you bought it.  Look at your sales documents and there should be charges for title and licensing.  Depending on your state, it may be difficult to get it changed over without the original owner.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Yes you have to transfer the title before you can sale it|`|fvN18yvGaa	Um If you never got the car in your name from the dealer then it doesnt belong 2 you..Im a guess and say that it was used, so tha means that somebody elses name is on the title.  |`|l5ClLY8qaa	Yes, because you have to sign off on the car when you sell it and the pink slip should be in your name just like the registration should be. |`|JHeP2sAZaa	yes you do, because the car is not legally yours until its in your name.  so change it over and just add the cost of that into the price of the car to break even.|`|6TUoIHiIaa	yes

RWjvcCYoaa	That last poster is dead wrong. There is no cooling off period when buying or leasing a car. Once you sign and drive, it's yours. You cannot return it tomorrow. <br>  <br>  You have buyer's remorse which most people get when stepping up for a new car. It happens much less on used cars. For some people, it takes a week to get over it. Others can take as long as a month. <br>  <br>  If you buy a house, you have 72 hours to change your mind. But not with a car. A house can't be moved. But a car is mobile. You can do a lot of driving in 72 hours and a lot of damage to a car too. That's why there is NO cooling off period. <br>  <br>  |`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	The next person to find a state with a cooling off period that actually exists will be the first one.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new ride.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Nope. Remember the papers you signed before they let you take the car? That's a legally binding contract, and unless it states you can return the car the next day - you can't.|`|TbiSBXclaa	You signed a long term financial agreement.  A contract.  An obligation.  The dealer held up his end, he delivered the car you wanted.  Now it's time to fulfill your portion of the agreement.  <br>  <br>  There is no legal right to return the car.  But Car dealers are smart businessmen and they will probably work with you if you change your mind.  But don't expect to walk out of the dealership with no penalty.<br>  <br>  |`|9ca8b7d729f1dd36f9ae8ae25a34b9ccaa	Sure you can....it is commonly referred to as a "repo" if you are not familiar with the term, "repo" in its original form is called a "repossession"!

First of all the Chevy is a beast of a truck and it looks awesome when it is dressed up. It has a very, very large cab and it is allot better than a Dodge any day. It just depends of what condition the Chevy is in, when it is that old. It is very hard to find one that has not been beaten up or that is in good running condition, letting alone just to find one. This must be your dream to have a K5 Blazer, because most people would not even consider of a trade when one vehicle is 13 years older than the other one. The 1983 K5 is one of the last of the Mohican's when it comes to this class of truck.|`|5GZru9b3aa	depends on what you need basically, I had a 96 Dak Sport 4 banger and still regret selling it 2 years ago
OmOEbRLHaa	Yes, there is something you can do.  You bought the vehicle expecting that it would work.  A dealer is still responsible for their vehicles and it would be deceptive practice for them to sell a vehicle that does not work.  A reasonable person purchasing a vehicle would only purchase a working vehicle.  It was advertised as a working vehicle.  The owner did not say, "This vehicle is being sold as is, and for this price, and has a few minor problems.  Do you want to buy my 'as is' vehicle."  You were under the impression that it was a working vehicle.  The person referring to the lemon laws is correct.  There are lemon laws in place for actions such as this.  I am not a lawyer, but am currently taking a business law class and this did come up.  My teacher who is a states prosecuting attorney did say that a person can hold the dealer liable.  Please do some research on this on your own and pursue action.  Do not allow the statue of limitations to pass you by on this.  Best wishes!|`|3MTYGEbWaa	Sorry, but this is a perfect example of why it is so important to have any used car inspected by a mechanic BEFORE the sale. You simply cannot take the word of the seller about a car's condition. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are no used car lemon laws, no right-of-return laws, and no way to prove that the dealer broke any laws when he sold you a used car under "as-is" terms.|`|gjAZeRyfaa	Fix it and find a good deal, trade that sucker in!!|`|8GDBr2U9aa	You can pay to get it fixed. You bought a used car and in doing so, you accept all risk. You had the opportunity to drive and inspect it before you bought it. It is YOUR responsibility as buyer to determine the condition of the vehicle. The dealer does not have to do anything for you.<br>  <br>  Lemon laws are designed to protect owners of new cars from serious, chronic defects under specific circumstances. Lemon laws are not a catch-all for everything that could possibly go wrong on a vehicle, nor are they intended to provide coverage in a situation such as yours.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	when a car is sold as is, there really isn't anything you can do about it if it doesn't work. next time take a mechanic with you when looking for a used car. sorry!|`|GIFCh6Ccaa	nothing.  that's why the car was sold 'as is'.|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	nothing...|`|l5ClLY8qaa	There is nothing you can do. If it says on your bill of sale that the car is " Sold As Is "  it means just that. That you have bought the car with any problems it has, and knowing that it might have problems, but you are aware of the risk of buying that car As Is. You might have wanted to buy a extended warranty from the dealership at the time of the sale and that would have covered you of getting the car fix if there where going to be any problems with the car.|`|fSBwGPHdaa	Cry i guess as is means as is you buy its all yours but it implies that there are most likely errors with in it if it was a great car they would want to tell you all about it to get you to really want it but as is means that they dont want to point out all the errors because then no one would want it.|`|nWU2rOSSaa	There is no such thing as a lemon law for used vehicles.

I don't especially like Renaults myself (too many bad experiences) but if you like them then why not a newer one?<br>  Other possibilities would include Fiesta or Astra diesel (they actually make an Astra 1.3 diesel apparantly), Corsa, Clio etc, the choices are almost endless.<br>  Don't dismiss Japanese cars either: they can look a bit dull but you can bet they'll be extremely reliable and well made too.|`|hkLY035raa	If you're considering another Megane, let me recommend that you skip a step: keep the Megane you have.<br>  <br>  Your car is only five years old.  It has many, many years of life left in it.  You've already invested a lot of money in purchasing this one - is it completely paid off?  If so, why would you bother to go into debt again for the questionable reliability of a vehicle you've never had before?<br>  <br>  I've only bought one new car in 20 years; I drove it to work this morning.  I think it has at least 10 more years of productive life left in it.   My total investment for purchase and repairs over that 20 years is, so far, $8500.<br>  <br>  Obviously the Megane is a completely different animal than what I'm driving but still - the most money-smart way to own a car is to buy it and drive it until it disintegrates from old age.  It will almost always always ALWAYS be cheaper to maintain and repair the car than to replace it with a new one.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone fool you with the fallacious argument that the repair (whatever it may be) is worth more than the value of the car.  That's answering the wrong question.  The right question is always, Is the repair worth more than the value of REPLACING the car?  In 98 cases of 100, the repair is cheaper.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	Take a look at the Suzuki Swift.

RWjvcCYoaa	Sure. It would be a voluntary repo since you can't pay for it anymore. And your credit will be destroyed for 7 to 10 years afterwards. You won't be able to finance a pair of shoes until it's off your history and you've rebuilt your credit again.<br>  <br>  Banks do not buy cars. They lend money to people to buy them. If you can't meet your obligation to them, it's a repo. Either forced or voluntary. Either one has the same affect on your credit for many years to come.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	hi ya<br>  i am not a banker and i have never had this exact situation happen to me<br>  BUT i do think that if you talk to your bank (where you have the car loan) and explain the situation that it will be much better for you to deal with it now and not wait until it gets out of control and you can't afford a payment<br>  <br>  i know i had to talk to my bank about something like this before and it was better that i dealt with it BEFORE the crisis happened<br>  <br>  i hope you can find a fair solution<br>  good luck<br>  |`|l5ClLY8qaa	   Yes
WpqwaqcQaa	12,000 to 15,000 miles a year is the accepted auto industry average per year.<br>  <br>  so if you figure that for $3,000 your looking at a car from 1997 or 98.<br>  <br>  that's 11 years so 11 X 15,000 = 165,000 miles.<br>  <br>  so anything with more than that is considered excessive and should bring a lower price than a car from the same year with less mileage.<br>  <br>  but mileage is not the most important thing, if the car has not been cared for and serviced regularly it's worse than a well cared for car with high mileage.|`|kUdGfQzxaa	It is depend on the brand of car.<br>  If you talking about BMW, then $3000 you can get only 250,000miles. Howver, if  you talking about Honda, you can get it around 120000miles|`|Vxdj3fkHaa	LOL, at the first poster "they may have one million miles" :-)<br>  <br>  For 3,000 you can expect to find cars that have over 100,000 miles, trust me that's what I've been finding out to with my research. However, you will be able to find cars that have less miles for the price, if they are have had accidents in the past and/or failed emissions testings. I HOPE that you have paid the $30 to get atleast a month's worth of car fax reports, so that you can check out the history of cars that you are considering to buy BEFORE you actually go out and look at them in person or shell out your hard earned $3000. <br>  <br>  Used car shopping is a drag...I am doing it now and I HATE IT!!!!

The Accord is more reliable, more comfortable, and maybe a close call on fun to drive, but knowing it will be fun longer...  And on top of all that when you go to get rid of it it will have depreciated less.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	I would select the Honda Accord. It would have a better resale value later, plus it is allot roomier than the Eclipse.

They're both a great bet for resale.<br>  <br>  I think your choice of V6 is fine as the four cylinder models don't give a whopping MPG gain on any of your chosen models, and the V6 models are great on the highway.  I recently had a Camry 4 cylinder rental car, and was not pleased with the performance.  It was quick, but it seemed as if the car was programmed with 75% of the throttle available in the first bit of pedal travel.  When stepping on the gas harder, all it did was cause a transmission downshift and an increase in RPM without much of a performance boost.  The V6, in comparison, doesn't resort to histrionics to get you up to speed (and beyond) in a hurry.<br>  <br>  I have not driven the current generation 4cyl Altima or Accord.<br>  <br>  The Accord and Camry are made in the US (at least most are).  I'm not sure about the Altima.  That would be a factor for me, as our economy is suffering and I would like to keep the dollars I spend fueling paychecks for US families.
G0i9793Xaa	It's not entirely true that a 4 cly wouldn't last as long as a V6. I've seen mid-sized 4 cly cars last over 400,000+ miles. The cars you mentioned have bigger 4 cly engines and should be durable but just like with any car; routine maintenance is the key to long service.  <br>  <br>  If you want to look at other cars with good 4 cly engines the Hyundai Sonata (32 MPG) and Chevy Malibu (33 MPG) are also good picks.  |`|7ObGOaPPaa	V6 engines have more power than 4 cylinder ones, but still have decent gas mileage. I have a v6 impala that gets something like 20 mpg in the city. and it accelerates alot more smoothly than the 4 cylinder camry that I had before it.<br>  <br>  mechanicially, there shouldn't be any reason why a v6 wouldn't run as long as a 4 cylinder|`|l5ClLY8qaa	I think a V6 is the only way to go. It may be some what a little bit more on the gas, but at least if you need the power you have it. Try also looking at the New Mazda 6, but out of the three cars you have picked I would chose the Altima 3.5. 
3MTYGEbWaa	It is not so much the mileage that matters, it's the actual condition of the car, as determined by an inspection by a qualified mechanic. Some cars with 100,000 miles that have been driven sensibly and maintained well, are in great condition and will easily go another 200,000 miles. Other cars with only 50,000 miles that have been abused and driven hard, are junk and won't last another 10,000 miles.<br>  <br>  Always get a mechanic's inspection BEFORE you buy any used car, regardless of mileage, and get a Carfax history report.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	NADA and Kelley Blue Book provide a price adjustment for mileage.  Considering that most cars today can run for 200,000 miles or more if properly maintained I would not be scared off by high mileage if the car is in good condition and the price reflects the mileage.  Also keep in mind that high mileage cars usually accumulated that mileage on the highway which is less harmful than hours of idling in traffic accumulating very few miles.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I would not reject a 94 Honda with 100,000 miles simply based on its mileage.|`|243zSJqpaa	Average is 12,000 nationally per year and 15,000 is acceptable in CA.<br>  <br>  so a 2004 is 4x12 and therefore approx 50K to 60K is considered normal.|`|l5ClLY8qaa	100,000 miles is way to much.

j3f8m6REaa	This is a perfect example of why it's so important to ALWAYS call your insurer when you have an accident.

JuxxAm0Baa	Grinding is the only way gears have to complain about what you're doing to them. Clutch must be used during any and all gear shifting unless you want expensive repair done on your car.<br>  Technically, your friend is right - but shifting without clutch needs expertise and feeling (if grinding takes place, an ingredient is missing). Generally, it's bad practice without any real advantage. Extending the clutch life and killing the gearbox in the process is not a bright idea. A good clutch, if well-used, will provide many trouble-free miles ahead.<br>  If you keep riding the clutch pedal while driving or touching it makes you feel safer etc, then yes, you'd better drop those bad habits. The less you touch a clutch and  keep it depressed, the longer it will last.<br>  The pedal should be fully depressed during all and any shifting. Keep low the carpeting under it. You can depress rather quickly, but release slowly (not TOO slowly), especially in 1st, 2nd and R. With red traffic light, shift to N and fully release the clutch pedal, put the left foot on the footrest or left of the pedal. You'll have plenty of time to shift into 1st while the pedestrian light is flashing or changing to red. Don't keep the clutch depressed for more than 10...15 secs and make sure it is done only at idle engine speed, never at higher revs.<br>  While braking just to slow down or downhill, do not operate the clutch - a(ny) gear must be engaged at all times while driving, otherwise the car won't handle well and may become unsafe at speed.<br>  If and when you're about to stop, shift down and depress the clutch at the last stage, but before the engine begins choking - it would eventually stall.<br>  #1 should read: parking brake on, gear in N, clutch down: start engine. The rest is more or less ok and up to your judgment, experience and common sense. Get used to listen to the car's engine - it tells a lot about how it handles your input. Try to see beyond the car in front of you, it saves shifting, clutching, gas and money.<br>  Frequent uphill starting from standstill, full payload, trailer hauling put extra stress on the clutch and transmission; reduce to minimum. Do not inch the car with clutch partly depressed, nor stop it from reversing using the 1st gear; brake it to the standstill first.<br>  Rule of thumb: the less the clutch is depressed, the better - but don't follow your friend's advice on clutch and grinding.|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Your friend is wrong about not having to engage the clutch when shifting only into first gear.  By shifting from first to all other gears without engaging (pushing /holding) the clutch, it will cause the gears to "grind" and eventually could cause damage. To hold the clutch in when stopped is proper, but holding the clutch in (riding the clutch) when driving will wear out the clutch plate faster.  Depending upon your speed in 2nd, you may not have to hold the clutch down.  In any case, always engage the clutch when shifting gears.|`|d0836e0785bb7c6faea2b62558249361aa	She's going to start stripping the gears. There is a reason the clutch is there.|`|TWsxP46Qaa	first part of your question was about driving without clutching to change gears,yes this can be done but its not recommended,do this only if your car has a clutch cable and the cable has snapped,if you keep the engine revs around the 1500/min mark you'll find that it doesnt grind as much<br>  <br>  as for it being a normal way to drive a manual,no its deffo not <br>  <br>  as for holding the clutch down,thats ok as long as your holding it way past the "biting" point,holding it at the biting point will burn out the clutch plates,<br>  <br>  however if your car has a hydraulic clutch system i dont recommend holding the clutch down,hydraulic systems WILL burn out a clutch plate even if your holding the pedal right down on the floor,i know this coz i burnt out a clutch on a ford mondeo after only 37,000 miles by doing exactly that|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	No, You are not wearing the clutch, you are doing it write by the way you said you are. That is what the clutch is for, starting out and shifting. Pushing in the clutch when coming to a stop is also fine to prepare for the stops. The only transmission that you shift with no clutch is the Big Rigs, semi`s, then you shift it with no clutch use do to they are non-synchronized gears. And some slight grinding can happen.<br>  So keep doing it the way you are. Good Luck.:^)|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	I hope that your friend doesn't drive a standard because every time time she grinds the gears, she is putting metal debris throughout the gear oil inside the transmission as well as literally grinding off the dog gears that the synchronizers ride against.<br>  Holding the clutch in doesn't wear the clutch - quite the opposite - only when the clutch is initially engaged is there any wear on the disk.

Este retardo en la combustion sirve para evitar el fenomeno de preignicion que es cuando la mezcla se quema antes de tiempo(cascabeleo), utilizando el octanaje apropiado para el motor, garantiza un mejor funcionamiento, en consecuencia mayor potencia y aprovechamiento del combustible.

But usually when I suggest to people who already own a car, and lets say I say I want a Ford, (because I like their styling) Someone biased will say not to get a Ford because of their transmission... And that's pretty much the only explanation I'll get. And they even go to say that dodge or gm is better than ford. While I'd say that some American cars are more reliable than what they were like lets say ten years ago, you could still get a lemon, but its not like you can't get one when you buy an import either. But American cars that I currently like are the Dodge Caliber, Pontiac G5 and the Ford Focus. If I get one later on I'll let you know how it worked out.

1ca078fb6ac9d1741007da931ca6cd16aa	It used to be done quite often. The old Volkswagen tires had a slightly rounded profile. The one very impotant thing that needed to be done in the past was to make sure you had the right rim, as motorcycle and auto rims were different. I don't know how/if that applies today.<br>  Tires have changed greatly over the last couple of decades.<br>  <br>  From a post in your link: "I hear people like the rounded edge profile of the Potenza, but believe me, it will never touch the road, with a CT the sidewall flexes in curves and the whole tread stays planted, that's why the handling feels so solid, you'll never lean it over enough to get onto the shoulder of the tire, your pegs and/or frame will hit before that happens."<br>  <br>  As with ANY mod, checking the fit and suitability of parts is key.<br>  So is awareness that it will be different from stock when you ride it.|`|fl60KL8oaa	As with anything, there is NO danger as long as you stay within limitations.<br>  <br>  The only negative for a car tire is less traction when leaning.  There is enough traction that you can scrape pegs on clear dry pavement.  The limitation kicks in only when hard cornering in the wet and/or over less than desirable surfaces.  Which means that if you have a car tire on your motorcycle you take it a bit easier in less than perfect conditions.<br>  <br>  The people that run car tires do so because the vast majority of their riding is in the vertical position.  When they use a motorcycle tire they simply wear out the middle, wasting the 80% of the tire that is used for cornering.|`|AA10346371	Car tires have a flat tread.  Motorcycle tires have a rounded tread so they get traction while leaning in a corner.  Cars don't lean in corners.<br>  <br>  I would think it would be dangerous to use a car tire on a motorcycle, even on a cruiser or touring bike.  This is because you would be fighting the bike to lean in a corner.  If the bike would lean in a corner you would ride up on the side wall which would give little traction.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't risk my life to save a few bucks on a tire.  Do it right and use a tire designed for the task.|`|qT3bi1Ynaa	Car tires harder compound will rear it's ugly head in the rain.  It has to do with tire design.

The tire's shape is not consistent with a motorcycle's handling.  the only place you could even dream of getting away with this is at a drag strip, and even then i'd be concerned.<br>  <br>  Motorcycles simply ask more from tires than cars.  A single tire failure on a car is 25% failure.  a single tire failure on a motorcycle is 50% failure.<br>  <br>  A car tire on a motorcycle will wear terribly, handle awful in the rain, and not provide nearly as much grip in the dry.  Among the MANY things these people aren't considering are:  contour, tread, and weight.  a 4,000 lbs car puts about 1,000 lbs of pressure on each tire.  That's enough to generate a lot more heat than even the heaviest cruiser.  a car tire on a motorcycle will never reach proper operating temperature, and thus never achieve optimal grip.<br>  <br>  just because you "can" doesn't mean you should.  As my dad would say, "your weiner fits a lot of places you shouldn't put it too."|`|dcjZuoxfaa	Its Ok to use, its up to you.

Don't expect miracles, though:.they squirm enormously when leaned over, keeping any cornering speeds at the very low end of the spectrum. This is not a big deal for most cruisers and, judging from the number of squared-off rear tires I see on liter-size sports bikes, it's not a big deal to many riders.<br>   <br>  As far as traction is concerned: they don't have as much as modern quality bike tires, but they aren't much worse than some of the early oriental stuff some of us learned to ride on (who remembers '70's Inoue or IRC tires ?). Those tires were genuine crap when braking or riding in the rain, yet we survived them. <br>  <br>  On the plus side, car tires will last 2-3 times as long as bike tires while costing less to begin with.
MDAsnqH0aa	La finalidad del A/C es sacar el aire caliente del interior del vehiculo cambiandolo por aire frio, este aire lo puede tomar de dos fuentes: una es del exterior, es decir, que cuando enciendes el A/C absorbe aire del exterior, lo filtra para no pasar el polvo, lo enfria y lo pasa a la cabina, sin embargo el filtro no quita los olores que se presenten en el, solo el polvo; la segunda fuente que es el boton que comentas y la que te recomiendo usar, es el aire recirculado, en esta funcion se cierra una compuerta impidiendo el paso del aire del exterior y lo que hace es tomar el aire de la cabina, filtrarlo, enfriarlo y repetir el procedimiento con el mismo aire, esto te permitira que no entren olores extra?os y que el rendimiento del aire sea el mayor, ya que no tendra que estar enfriando el aire de la temperatura ambiente a la requerida, sino que enfriara un aire que ya esta mas frio y asi sucesivamente.<br>  <br>  Esto tambien te contribuye en un menor consumo de combustible, ya que el compresor no tendra que estar trabajando de sobremanera, podras bajar la velocidad del ventilador y reducir asi el ruido que genera.<br>  <br>  Es recomendable apagar el A/C cuando menos 3 Min. antes de apagar el vehiculo, esto sin apagar el ventilador para permitir que la condensacion que se forma se seque, ya que de lo contrario esas gotas de agua oxidan partes moviles como el ventilador ademas de que al acumularse en los ductos o mangueras empieza a generar un olor a humedad que despues no solo se presentara al encender el A/C sino  siempre.<br>  <br>  Por lo pronto te recomiendo hacer un servicio de limpieza de los ductos, para esto venden unos aromatizantes secadores en algunas autobutiques y lubricar con algun aceite mineral (el WD40 es buena opcion) las partes moviles del ventilador y compuerta de aire recirculado para anular el rechinido|`|NhrSO86xaa	Si es como un chillido ponele WD-40.

MDAsnqH0aa	El Gobernador es una resistencia que se coloca en el cuerpo de aceleracion que al momento en que llegas a una velocidad determinada en la computadora del vehiculo (PCM) cierra el paso de la corriente electrica, cierra la mariposa de entrada de aire y deja de funcionar la bobina, por lo tanto, el motor deja de funcionar en cuanto al sistema de combustion se refiere hasta que baja la velocidad a causa de la desaceleracion y una vez que detecta estas por debajo de la velocidad predeterminada como maxima vuelve a funcionar el motor, en el focus ZX3 la velocidad maxima esta determinada a 179.84 Km/h por lo que si llegas a esa velocidad sentiras como si se apagara el motor hasta llegar a los 175 km/h y luego volveras a sentir como si se encendiera y asi sucesivamente por lo que en un ZX3 no podras llegar a los 180 km/h, el SVT no cuenta con este sistema por lo que extraoficialmente podras llegar a los 215 km/h.<br>  La diferencia en potencia auque es el mismo motor, se debe a que el equipo SVT tuneo o modifico el motor y con cada modificacion fueron aumentando hp's, las modificaciones mas importantes y que ayudaron al aumento de potencia fueron:<br>  <br>  Mejora del flujo de los gases de admisión y escape: tiene nuevos conductos, un nuevo sistema de distribución variable y válvulas de mayor diámetro. <br>  éste es el primer motor Ford que tiene un conducto de admisión doble (Dual Stage Intake - DSI), con un conducto largo que se utiliza a bajas vueltas para mejorar el par y uno corto que permite entrar un mayor caudal de aire a alto régimen. También tiene bielas más resistentes y unos nuevos pistones con modificaciones en la cabeza, que han permitido aumentar la relación de compresión de 9,6 hasta 10,2 a 1.El incremento de potencia viene acompa?ado por una caja de cambios Getrag de seis marchas (con desarrollos cortos y transmisiones reforzadas) y significativos cambios en el bastidor; tiene suspensiones más duras, llantas de aleación más grandes (7 x 17 pulgadas), llantas más anchas (215/45 ZR 17) y discos de freno de mayores dimensiones. Los delanteros son ventilados y tienen 300 mm de diámetro (258 mm el Focus ZX3), los traseros son solidos y de 280 mm (253 mm en el ZX3).<br>  <br>  Despues de tanto rollo te envio un link si quieres saber un poco mas detallados los cambios y si requieres mas informacion, con todo gusto<br>  <a href="http://myfordfocus.com/svt/" rel="nofollow">http://myfordfocus.com/svt/</a>

dWLgwb3baa	You can get tickets pretty easily through any of the internet travel sites - Travelocity, Expedia, etc. or the airline's website.  Kayak.com is my favorite because it searches multiple sites.<br>  <br>  There are no direct flights between those city pairs.  Several airlines have one stop flights connecting through a hub city.<br>  <br>  As for the "unaccompanied minor" service, you can elect to use that if you wish.  It is not required for 16 year olds, but many airlines have the service available.  The fee varies by airline, but expect about $100 extra each way.<br>  <br>  If you need that service or not is up to you and your parents.  Basically, an adult brings you to the airport and releases you to airline custody.  Each step of the way, there is an airline employee responsible for you.  A customer service agent will bring you to the gate and supervise you until you board, at which point a flight attendant will assume responsibility until you land.  At that point, a customer service agent will bring you to the next gate and stay with you until you board the next plane.  When you arrive at MYR, a designated adult must sign a form to release you.<br>  <br>  If you have good social skills and common sense, you may not need that level of supervision.  The PWM airport won't be difficult to navigate.  Once you get to a hub city, you can go to the customer service desk (there's one at every gate) and say that you're traveling alone for the first time and the agent will give you directions to where you need to go next.<br>  <br>  For the most part, airports are fairly easy to navigate.  There are signs everywhere pointing you to where you need to go.<br>  <br>  Have fun!

7BHIyMFmaa	Your CV lacks the PI heads. The Crown Vic didn't get the PI heads/intake until 2001. So Marauder intake would be largely wasted on a non-PI engine.

qGpD9ntNaa	The cold air intake will do nothing except drain your wallet. Your truck already has a cold air intake. There is a piece of tubing that runs from your throttle body to outside of the engine compartment. (the strange thing is most cold air intakes do not do this) It will not flow any better than a good wix air filter. And will give you absolutely no horse power gains. It will just make the truck a little louder and make it sound like it has a vacuum leak.<br>  Cold air intakes are a complete and total scam the do nothing for you motor.<br>  <br>  The Throttle body spacer will give you a little better throttle response but only 1 or 2 horse power at best. <br>  <br>  The exhaust should give you 5 to 10 more horse power but i would not expect anymore than that. <br>  <br>  You can change the fuel, spark settings and shift points on the computer for a few more horse power. But the only real way to make a dramatic difference in horse power is to get head work done and upgrade the cam.|`|NZO3Nr0Baa	25 HP... maybe 30 tops......|`|mwu6aJuyaa	I'll agree. Your intake will make more HP because of your better exhaust flow, and your exhaust flow will make more HP because of your intake. It's a system of balance. If you had only done exhaust, or intake, neither would have given you much of an increase because the other end is the limiting factor. The fact that you have both, will allow both parts to reach their potential. (That is how intake companies rate their products as being able to give 15 or 20 hp). I would say 20 - 25 is a realistic number. Your TBS will change your power ban and give you a better air fuel mixture which means you will get a more complete burn. Being that you have alot more airflow, your TBS will do more for you than a guy who only has a TBS and nothing else.<br>  <br>  Now that you have better air flow capabilities, if you REALLY want to take advantage of that power, you need to tell your computer in the truck that it has more air at it's disposal which means it can mix more fuel into the equation. To do this you will want a chip or a tuner computer. I recomend the tuner because you can set it to use more fuel for when you want the HP, or you can change it to lean it out when you feel like getting better gas mileage.<br>  <br>  This comany sells them:<br>  Jetperformance.com<br>  <br>  Just remember it's a complete system. You need more air and more fuel to make more power. Right now you have the air, now you just need to make sure that your truck is going to be putting more fuel in there to mix with all that extra air.|`|HwbBJyMdaa	The Cold Air intake alone from the engine is a 10-15 horsepower increase. Headers is a great way to improve horsepower since stock manifolds are restrictive and headers have better flow. You can get up to 10 horsepower per header sometimes depending on what engine you are using. The smaller the engines bore is the less increase the horsepower will be. I put a set of cheap flowtech headers on to a 350 (casting No 3970010 meaning not original engine) in a 1981 Camaro that was making 220hp. Once I added the headers the power increased be 18.262 (off the dyno record). <br>  <br>  The spacer will not be much around 3 or 4 horsepower increase. You know back in the day when they never had spacers for carbed engines, many people including my self made are own spacers out of wood. This worked perfect since the wood would absorb heat transfer. This gave my engines a nice horsepower increase up to 8 to 10 horsepower, even more than a modern metal spacer would. All you would half to do is paint it silver so no one would notice it.<br>  <br>  I have a question about your exhaust. Is it a whole kit with mufflers too? If so stock mufflers don't create a whole lot of back pressure and aftermarket does. This means much more horsepower than stock. Although if you have to much back pressure you will begin to lose horsepower. In total it should be about 5 or 6 horsepower per muffler and about 8 for the rest of the exhaust so about 13 or 14 horsepower increase.<br>  <br>  With all your upgrades your looking at a maximum of about 48 horsepower off the engine. The back wheels I would say about 25 to 30 horsepower. If you really want to make lots of power get 30lbs injectors and get your cylinder heads ported. The heads getting ported is a good 15 horsepower per head so 30 horsepower and the 30lbs injectors will make a good 25 to 30 horsepower increase off the engine. But paying someone to port heads is expensive so i would just do it my self, and injectors! lets not even get into prices.<br>  <br>  If your interested in porting the heads your self all you need to do is move your finger around the ports and if you feel something grabbing your finger its a spot that should be ground down a bit. all you are trying to do is make the ports smooth at the entrance but taking off a minimum amount off the ports as possible. If you port it to much you will continue to make more power but you will start to lose throttle response. That means no power through idle to 3000rpm and a sudden **** load of power from 3000rpm to red line.|`|qxSlQoRAaa	if you're talking HP at the wheels..intake is maybe 3-5 (don't believe that 10-15hp crap people tell you).  spacer..very minimal.  Your exhaust setup is pretty good though. you might get 15 out of that.  I'd say 20hp to the wheels, maybe a bit more, but I'd say 25 max.

aZLRK7gTaa	Ciao, non badare alle risposte sbagliate.<br>  All'aspirante pilota non è richiesta alcuna laurea ma un titolo di diploma di scuola superiore, vanno bene tutti ma preferibilmente è meglio avere una maturità scientifica. Il top sarebbe il diploma presso un istituto aeronautico.<br>  Il pilota autorizzato alla condotta di aerei di linea deve possedere un brevetto particolare chiamato ATPL, cioè Air Transport Pilot Licence. Questo è il brevetto richiesto per i piloti commerciali (cioè che percepiscono uno stipendio per la loro attività volativa) e che trasportano passeggeri o merci.<br>  Esiste anche il CPL, Commercial Pilot Licence, un brevetto di grado inferiore che autorizza il pilota a percepire uno stipendio per il lavoro fatto con aerei traino striscioni, avvistamento incendi, rilevamenti aerei etc. ma non il trasporto di persone o cose).<br>  Il brevetto ATPL è molto costoso (più o meno 60.000 euro) e spesso si preferisce andare negli USA o, guarda caso, in Australia dove vengono rilasciati titoli compatibili anche con i regolamenti europei. <br>  Ti avverto che oltre al costo importante occorre molto impegno poichè al di là delle numerose ore di volo (quello possono anche essere piacevoli) devi studiare tantissimo e frequentare molte ore di lezioni teoriche.<br>  Ti consiglio il forum www.md80.it specialmente nell'area riservata alle licenze di pilotaggio. Li potrai trovare ragazzi come te che hanno iniziato e finito l'iter per ottenere questo brevetto oppure direttamente con piloti e comandanti navigati.<br>  A parte questo in Italia esistono molte scuole di volo ubicate presso gli aeroclub più importanti (Milano, Varese) oppure su professione volare.<br>  <br>  Buona Fortuna.|`|dSQ8WoLzaa	Vi sono varie scuole di volo in italia ma pochissimi istituti tecnici aeronautici. L'unico italiano ad essere certificato con tutto e più è il Turin Flying Institute. è una scuola (Istituto tecnico) in cui è compresa anche la scuola di volo quindi finiti i 5 anni (ti fanno fare anche il brevetto intanto PPL : private pilot licence) vi sono 2 anni di licenza per pilota di linea ATPL. Finito la scuola ti assumono in compagnia et voilà! PILOTA in 5 anni + 2. Io adesso sono in 2° ma se vuoi puoi anche iscriverti ora e finire la scuola (4° e 5°) e poi fare i 2 anni successivi.

A VOR transmits toward the horizon a narrow beam that rotates about the station's azimuth at 30 Hz.  There is also a 9960 Hz omnidirectional subcarrier that is frequency modulated with a 30 Hz reference.  This reference is synchronized with the rotating signal such that there is a positive-going zero crossing coincident with the rotating signal passing thru magnetic north.  VOR receivers use the relative phase angle between the two signals to calculate the bearing from the VOR site.    ///   NDBs transmit no such bearing information.|`|NpStGn5baa	Quite simple. Its called a non directional beacon cause it transmits a non directional signal. All the direction finding is done at the receiver or ADF.<br>  <br>  The reason it is not called a omni-directional beacon is because it does not transmit signals on each degree individually. i.e 360 degrees, which a VOR does.<br>  <br>  If you understand how a VOR works you should understand my explanation.

MDAsnqH0aa	Pennzoil es una marca que se elabora en la misma planta y con la misma tecnología de Shell, esta marca es mundialmente reconocida por lubricar motores de alta tecnología como los de la F1 en el equipo Ferrari, básicamente Pennzoil esta formulado con básicos parafinicos vírgenes altamente refinados de alto índice de viscosidad lo que protege la consistencia del aceite en diferentes rangos de temperaturas, esto te permite obtener toda la protección del motor desde el arranque, sumado a su paquete de aditivos que da una mayor estabilidad térmica, resistencia a la oxidación, baja volatilidad y reduce la formulación de sedimentos lo que contribuye en menor consumo de combustible y menor desgaste del motor, Quaker State es parte también del grupo Shell, sin embargo se fabrica en una planta diferente y con similar pero no igual tecnología a la de Shell y Pennzoil, por lo que yo te recomendaría Pennzoil.|`|CiJBhYEkaa	penezoil me suena a otra cosa<br>  <br>  y castradol tambien <br>  <br>  ninguno|`|0I7XHZSGaa	Ambos<br>  <br>  Verifica solamente el grado que requiere tu auto, debe estar en la tapa del aceite<br>  <br>  Depende mucho tambien de tu kilometraje ya que de ser alto puedes usar uno especial para alto kilometraje, ambas marcas lo manejan, o incluso usar un monogrado si tu motor anda muy cansado<br>  <br>  Yo en lo personal prefiero castrol multigrado|`|3A9qaBBgaa	Las dos son buenas tene en cuenta uqe estas hablando de primeras marcas|`|D0jyrJsOaa	PENZOIL sin ninguna duda|`|nJpa7du1aa	Sinceramente Castrol, ya que es una marca Legitima, <br>  No se si sabias pero la marca Penzoil es subsidiaria de la marca Quaker Satate.

Ee1qhvIVaa	Son muy buenas marcas. Y quisa hasta mas baratas y mejores que algunas nacionales.<br>  Para el tipo de auto y de clima te recomiendo que sea aceite Multigrado independientemente de la marca.<br>  Si no encuentras un multigrado un SAE 40 esta bien.<br>  No uses aditivos para aceite y constantemente revisa niveles, consistencia  y color al aceite. (cada 4,000 km)|`|AA10052473	Bueno el modelo es reciente no entiendo por que quieres arruinar el motor usando diferente aceite del que te recomiendan, lee la informacion en esta pagina <a href="http://www.automecanico.com/auto2002/aceite.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.automecanico.com/auto2002/ace...</a> en donde he vivido e estado a 112 grados F. haci como a grados bajo cero, y no he cambiado de aceite, ahora ya se usa el multigrado y los sinteticos, solo te recomiendo no cambies de numeros o tu motor lo va a resentir, pero en fin, solo piensa en esto los ingemieros estudiaron bastante para hacer que los motores cumplan al maximo en su rendimiento, por que nosotros que no tenemos ni idea de lo que es un polimero deseamos contradecirlos y cambiar algo que ellos ya comprobaron? bueno toma tu decision, alarga la vida de tu motor o matalo, suerte.|`|474728a7edc25a83eebcf695234902bfaa	USA ACEITES SINTETICOS|`|5b0eb9fe1783ec1eb9c09085ccd843f0aa	hasta donde se el 5 se refiere a la temperatura ambiente mas baja y el 20 a la temperatura ambiente mas alta, osea 20 °C.<br>  Es mejor el 20w50 o 25-50 si hace mucho calor|`|MDAsnqH0aa	El grado de viscosidad que muestra tu manual se refiere a un 5W20, en México no existe una buena marca que cubra este rango, por lo regular todas lo exceden, yo te recomendaría utilizar un aceite sintético como el Pennzoil Synthetic 5W40, este aceite tiene un índice de Viscosidad de 168 lo que te permite operar el motor en temperaturas desde -27 °C hasta 210 °C sin alterar sus propiedades de protección, antidesgaste y sin formar sedimentos o cenizas en los cilindros.|`|a29f617e9f2f28a8e96cbd2a51e5c8deaa	noooooooooooo ira si tu carro especifica 20 de viscosidad es por que las venas del motor son muy delgadas y seguramente el 30 o el 40 si pasan pero no con la rapidez que se requiere pa que lubrique bien el motor en cuanto al 5 eso no importa tanto solo se refiere a la resistencia al frió pero el 20 si es muy importante|`|xlKf0uXAaa	mira te recomiendo un catrol sintetico   ya que  con el calor el aceite se hace agua  y este aceite te guarda propiedades  al menos a mi me funcionaba super bien  es algo mas  caro  que los demas pero bein vale la pena  y es 10-35 el que puedes encontrar  en las refaccionarias si es que estas en la frontera ya que es el  gabacho  y te  serviria mucho para tu auto

MDAsnqH0aa	Hola, lo primero es saber que es lo que no funciona del cilindro, puede ser por alguna fuga en la camara, en la cabeza en el multiple, por que tiene flameada una valvula, por que no tiene chispa la bujia o por que se desgastaron los anillos o por que se rompio una biela, todo tiene solucion, claro esta que unas mas baratas que otras, te recomiendo que hagan una prueba de compresion y fugas y te de los valores de todos los cilindros, me des el kilometraje, vean si tiene chispa en la bujia, la saquen y vean si esta contaminada de aceite, gasolina o anticongelante (con el olor lo identificas), el aceite del motor que apariencia y olor tiene (con la bayoneta puedes obtener una muestra) y si al encenderlo principalmente en frio hace algun ruido en particular, tal vez con los resultados de estas pruebas podamos dar con la causa real del problema y verificar si tiene una solucion antes de anillar o ajustar el motor.<br>  Tambien convendria saber de que auto o motor hablamos.<br>  una vez que tengas los resultados de las pruebas que son muy sencillas y las puede hacer uno mismo, si quieres me los pasas a ver si te puedo ayudar a solucionarlos. <br>  Saludos.|`|ENcbhuUlaa	cambiate de mecanico porque ese no sabe nada!<br>  creo que lo tenes que cambiar al cilindro|`|7c4ddce44014913f4a71cce0a00c9369aa	ASi está medio cabron saerb de que se trata, lo mas habitual y el prodcedimiento que normalmente se sigue es:<br>  <br>  1. checar los cables de las bujías, que les chequen continuidad y resistencia, muchas veces aunque el cable saque chispa, ésta no es suficiente para hacer jalar la bujía, si el cable de ese cilindro está mal, cambiarlo y asunto arreglado, si no:<br>  <br>  2. checar la bujía de ese cilindro, muchas veces las bujías se aislan y no pasan la corriente del cable para la chispa, si no está aislada, muchas veces se carbonizan por una mala carburación o ajuste en la abertura de la misma, si está carbonizada, se limpia y deberia funcionar de nuevo, si no está carbonizada pero está llena de aceite, entonces ya es otra cuestion<br>  <br>  3. si está llena de aceite puede ser que esté mal el empaque de la cabeza, o algún sello de vàlvula.<br>  <br>  4. si no es nada de lo anterior, es necesario que le verifiquen la compresión a ese y a los demas cilindros, pues es probable que necesite anillos nuevos o en el peor de los casos un ajuste completo. <br>  <br>  Respecto a lo que te dicen arriba que puede ser que esté el pistón roto, eso lo sabrás por que tiene un ruido extra?o y desagradable en el motor.|`|1de25b617b59bd2fd4fd0e7acc300eedaa	A mí me pasó eso con mi primer coche, y arrancaba pero no tenía fuerza para circular y menos cuesta arriba...

TVC will only cost you time in court, and you will probably still lose, or get a lower speed (still get points)<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to call the officer that issued the ticket, and ask if there is some other charge you can plea guilty to in order to eliminate the points, even if you need to pay a higher fine to do so. Most officers will work with you (so long as it is in their power to do so). <br>  <br>  You WERE nice and polite to the officer on the stop... right?|`|v4BTTvfZaa	Never used them before.

UU76HDwoaa	Whynot do it.  As mentioned, your car is 14yrs old, it probably needs new suspension.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest a lower kit from a company like Eibach.  Some new struts from KYB and a camber correction kit.  Maybe some new strut mounts to replace all the old parts.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't be worried about bottoming up unless you reuse your old tired struts or buy new OEM struts.  Most struts don't have the damping to handle the higher spring rates offered by lowering springs.|`|AoNBI840aa	If you live on the salt flats, yeah you'll be fine for bottoming out. Anywhere that has terrain you'll be hitting the bottom and costing yourself lots of money to repair your oil pan, your axles...<br>  <br>  Or just do it and get skid plates.|`|lsjMmZuiaa	Problems with the suspension bottoming out should be rare - i think the bigger question is "do i want to sink a lot of money into a car that's 14 years old?"<br>  <br>  your camber worries should be fixed with a simple (cheap) tire-alignment.  any shop should be able to do that for $50.

4dntstR9aa	Ok, in short, it sounds like the part doesn't fit very well.  You mentioned two taillights...does that mean the side they didn't work on is fine and the side they did work on doesn't match the other side?  <br>  If you went through Insurance I would call your adjuster and let them know how unhappy you are with your repairs.  It could be any number of reasons why the light doesn't fit.  It could be an aftermarket part (which means the parts are made overseas by a foreign company - and NOT by your cars manufacturer)  These parts are very common in insurance work, because the insurance company saves money by putting generic parts on your car.  But heres the deal, if it doesn't fit, and your not happy, it needs to be replaced with another light.  Thats only one scenario.  It could be the metal on the quarter panel wasn't repaired properly.  If thats the case, the light needs to be removed and another repair needs to be done, then it would need to be repainted again.  Without seeing it, it's really hard to guess.  If you went through insurance, be persistent and talk to your adjuster though.  They can help you get it fixed.  Body work is done by people and people make mistakes.  <br>  <br>  I am assuming that you mentioned the fit to the body shop and they are not acknowledging your complaint like you want them to...so again, I urge you to talk to your adjuster and let them handle it.  <br>  <br>  IF YOU PAID CASH for your repair, you will need to get the shop involved.  Your best bet is to go get some back up, possibly at the Dealership that sells yor make of car.  Ask the Technician or service writer if they think this gap is normal.  It sounds to me like its not normal, and you need someone to give you more  info on why.  <br>  Sorry this is long winded!  <br>  <br>  Also, check into the warranty you have on the repairs.  Alll shops are different.  Some Insurance companies that have "direct repair" shops make the shops give lifetime warranties on the repairs, some shops have "taillight warranties" and some have 30 days.  I would look at your Estimate or your Repair Order and read the fine print...It HAS to state what their warranty is for the repairs.  Then if you did pay cash and didn't go through the Insurance, you will have to force them to fix it under their warranty policy.  If I were you I would be talking to the Shop Manager only and I would have all my homework done.  The more ammunition you have, the less they can argue with you.  Take pictures of the same model car at the New Car dealership and bring them with you.  If you have pictures of your car before it was damaged and it shows that it wasn't this way before, take those too.  But be persistent - that doesn't mean to go in there and be a B**ch...just go in and kill them with kindness, which may be hard, but you will get a lot further.  Trust me when I say, they will take care of it - but you will have to push if they don't want to admit there is something wrong.  Good luck and you can email me if you have more questions too.  If you want to take some pictures of the taillight and send them to me, I will try and help you more.<br>  Kimberlee|`|zOIgzIy4aa	sounds like they did,nt get the bumper adjusted right. it probably needs to be pulled up some to match the other side.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Not enough info. What kind of a car is it? Take it to a dealer who sells that kind of car and compare it with one that has not been fixed. Something doesn't sound right here. Good luck.|`|nAK8bm91aa	I would have to see it, But I do believe I know what your talking about.<br>  It could be what's called settling of the body parts. And after an accident sometimes a repair does not always come out with the best looking cosmetics afterwords. If your dissatisfied with the appearance ask for it to be raised the difference. With today's knowledge, I am not going to say it would be clearly impossible. Another way to fix this cheaply, would be to use silicone of the same color of your car and fill the gap.<br>  Hope this helps|`|b2dc60672d2dc34b132374bea24eb015aa	Any car repaired after accident cannot be restore its original body built so the gap and clearance little bit affected. You have to ask the repairman to make necessary adjustment to fix the tailight more nearly to its original position.|`|n3IQlhdFaa	The bottom line is...if it's not right, It's not right..contact your insurance company(who paid for the repair) have them work with the body shop to fix the problem

56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	You have an air pocket in the cooling system. Remove the radiator cap, top up the anti-freeze and then run the motor with the radiator cap off. Make sure you have the heater set to the highest temperature setting in the car and leave the blower fan off or on low. After the motor comes up to operating temperature you can rev the motor to 2,500 rpm and squeeze the radiator hoses to help purge the air. If air bubbles keep appearing you may have a bad head gasket. The air pocket may have been caused by a leaking water pump, hose, intake manifold leak or head gasket.|`|mKVFIklaaa	Sounds like poor coolant circulation: I'd suspect kinked or sludged up hoses to the heater matrix|`|sPiwb8Hraa	All of your answerers gave you correct answers. Congrats. There is one last thing that wasn't mentioned: air gap in the cooling matrix. If the cooling matrix is low on coolant, an air gap will occur in the system. This will cause the problem that you have stated. If this is the problem, what you have to do is remove the cap while the engine is running AND THE HEATER IS ON FULL BLAST, and add coolant until the system fills up. What you are doing is removing the vacuum voids. Now, some coolant will boil over during this process. You should wear safety goggles and stand clear. It will take about 12-15 minutes from start to finish. You MUST KEEP YOUR HEATER ON FULL BLAST while you are doing this.<br>  <br>  Do not panic over coolant overflow. It is going to happen as the voids are released. It is a process, of getting the coolant level back to where it should be.<br>  <br>  Safety! Safety!

Or does it rise and fall as you are driving?<br>  If it rises and falls then there may be an issue with the thermostat.<br>  If it warms up and stays constant then the most likely suspect is the hot water inlet valve to the heater matrix. When you turn the heater up a wire from the dial opens as simple water valve allowing hot water to enter the heater matrix.<br>  The inside of this valve is very small and often blocks up with rust or dirt.

Jiffy Lube would be the last place. high school kids, stoners, and females work there. <br>  <br>  of course you can take an acura to a honda dealership. thats asking if you can take a honda to a honda dealership. do it.<br>  <br>  btw, bad *** car.|`|UdIybwRpaa	I would inquire how much the oil change costs at the dealership. Many dealerships are now offering oil changes at a price very competitive with the Jiffy Lube type places. Any garage should be able to handle changing your oil. Jiffy Lube would be last choice.|`|RJwfuzGxaa	Yess u can bring it there. But u can also try bringing it to local gasoline stations that offer it.<br>  Its all about competition and where is cheaper than others.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	You will have no problem taking it there. Acura and Honda are the same thing, same engines, same transmission, just minor differences. I have a first generation TSX, and have had it serviced at Honda before. For future reference, if you need replacement parts, such as wiper blades, visit the Honda dealer, it's like half the price of the Acura dealer for the same exact part.|`|AA11606818	Absolutely!  I bring my 2003 RSX-S in to my local Honda dealership all the time.  Acura's labor rate is typically $110/hr whereas Honda dealerships typically charge $60/hr.    I would also expect oil changes to be slightly cheaper at Honda. <br>  <br>  I personally wouldn't take my car to any type of oil change center like Jiffylube or Valvoline. Too many young kids working there.   Either find a dealership or learn to do it yourself.
W3KqA9t1aa	OPEN SPEED LIMIT?!?!?!<br>  <br>   I have a Infiniti G37 that I might consider driving at a sustained 110-120 mph. over a long distance on street tires. If the factory had supplied better quality rubber I might be tempted to bump that up to 130-135 MPH but no more than that. Too many things can go wrong at those speeds.<br>  <br>   The guy with the Saturn SL2 is blowing smoke. Those things aren't safe at 90 MPH. on racing rubber.|`|GyXn2L4naa	1998 Pontiac Sunfire Sedan 130 MPH - ROTFL<br>  <br>   Actually, I wouldn't dream of trying to sustain more that 75 - 80 MPH in this car. It is in very good condition and has a brand new set of brakes and brand name tires on it. But, in all honesty, this car was never designed for the speeds indicated by previous responders.<br>  <br>   I'd like to know what the dude with the Saturn is smoking though.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I'm comfortable driving 90 or 95 mph in my 1991 Honda Accord. One time, I got up to 98 mph (tried to reach 100) and it felt like I was going too fast. 92-93 mph seems to be my limit.|`|JKQhSGEEaa	my truck right now top speed 130. 100 is good for me. ive done 165 before so 100 doesnt scare me.|`|4uf044sFaa	I have a ford mustang, so 100 feels very comfortable.  I drove from South Carolina to Virginia on Christmas day a couple years ago, and there were no cops and only a few cars on the road, and they were all doing 100 mph, so I decided to do the same for about 2 straight hours.  I am comfortable driving 100 mph for a long period of time in perfect conditions.  I have driven well over 100 mph, but I am completely comfortable at only 100 mph.  It felt weird when I backed off to 90 mph.  It felt like I was barely moving.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	No faster than you are comfortable with|`|ydUME5f9aa	well in sexual terms a proper speed limit is 68 miles per hour<br>  <br>  <br>  at 69 miles you have to stop and turn around|`|DV4xyeChaa	ive spent some time at 90mph in my 1999 s10 chevy pickup...my wifes subaru feels fine at 100/105|`|XLXncQu9aa	I would try my best to keep at a safe speed.  A safe speed in my opinion would be 55 or 65.  I wouldn't want to travel too high above 65.  Many drivers drive faster on highways as it stands.  Even if there were no cops, I would try not to speed above that range.  Driving at fast speeds is dangerous in general.  You shouldn't be wary of the speed limit for the police officer's sake or because you think you will be caught.  However it is a safety issue.  The faster you travel, the more risk there is for losing control of your car.  Just because the weather may be perfect on the roadway's and the speed limit is open, it doesn't mean you should ignore driving safely.  Having an open speed limit would only mean more accidents because many wouldn't have any regulations to stand by.  They would go based on how they feel rather than what is safe.|`|AA12103453	Well with no speed limit I'd probably still stop around 70. To be honest I'm happy going 55-60 and go around 65 when the speed limit reaches that. The reason though is because that is about the speed my car was designed for and after that the gas mileage goes down. I realize gas isn't that much(only $2 a gallon around here) but still better not wasting it just to go faster, I don't have anywhere that important to go. Now if I didn't care about the fuel economy I'd probably be happy going up at about 80 or up to 90 in that situation as well. I may be driving a little Honda Civic but it handles fine.
dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	No I haven't BUT my mother,  who is well into her golden years did something similar.  She and my dad went shopping,  they said they would meet at the car in about a half hour. So she went out to the parking lot,  found the car and got into the seat on the passenger side to wait for my dad.  She sat there for a while waiting.  She looked around and saw my Dad sitting in their car in the next row,  looking at her laughing!  She was so embarrassed!  He just wanted to wait and see how long it would take her to notice.  No harm done,  except that this is one of my Dad's favorite stories.|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	LOL. Meli's answer is great!!

crhJLuw5aa	The telephone pole and chain idea works just fine, but be VERY careful. I've successfully used this method many times, but the very FIRST time I tried it, I backed up too fast & screwed the whole thing up much worse than if I had left it alone. It's easy to do. Just try small tugs, at least at first, and you'll be OK. Also, if you can get a piece of wood behind it, like a 1" x  2"; it'll help prevent the chain from kinking the metal too much.|`|AHygXkmfaa	Don't take the bumper off.

Wmz1gB3Maa	Like everyone one else has said, its a really bad habit to have, and you should try to break yourself of it as soon as you can. When you are going up through the gears its a waste of time to move to the side every time, but make sure your foot is off the clutch pedal 100%, and then when you are cruising, just put it on your dead pedal, or the space to the far left. its designed for you to rest your foot there.<br>  If you do not, you will be replacing clutches a lot faster then you need to.|`|YnbWGbVvaa	Touch your clutch as little as possible... they are made from a similar material as the brake pads. If you rest your foot on the brakes, you will wear them out quick... just like you would your clutch. I dont even use it to take the car out of gear when coming to a stop. I just let off the gas and take it out of gear. That doesnt hurt it as long as you dont rip it out of gear...|`|0fb4589d7d6babcc79f63404f6039751aa	Nope|`|AA11808995	Don't tell that to the Garage under a Warranty claim.|`|XinTNCJUaa	No I don't rest my foot on the clutch pedal as this can cause damage.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Its a bad habit I have.|`|dmcsi7a0aa	As much as resting my foot on the clutch pedal is comfortable, i try my best not too.  But if you have an intentionally stiif clutch pedal (meaning its really got a strong resistance - if you don't bother having the difficulty of shifting gears with a heavy pedal as well) that's ok.  A feathery light clutch pedal might cause unwanted wear on the disk since the weight of ones foot can cause a slight clutch disk disengagement and, yes, that may cause the slipping.|`|1cc0530fb7fd6e139f507fa33c7d10f1aa	No. I don't want to change the clutch / bearings / operating mechanism any sooner than necessary.<br>  Your new car clutch is slipping? Surprise, surprise - now you are going to find out the cost of lazy driving.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	if your not pushing the clutch pedal to the floor, your foot shouldn't be touching it. That's how you burn up a clutch.|`|AHygXkmfaa	Yeah you shouldn't do that.

uDuwc7Yoaa	The big 3 is an upgrade to your stock electrical wiring. Its use is when you add electronics to your car that require more current than your factory wiring can safely conduct.<br>  If a large amount of current goes through your factory wiring it will gradually warm up, and the insulation may melt and you'll have a short circuit. Adding to or replacing your stock wiring will allow a larger amount of current to be conducted without it overheating.<br>  Be careful not to blast your stereo with the engine off or with it idling. Doing either of those will lay the smack down on your battery. Because an alternator is only going to put out enough current for your amp and for charging your battery and everything else once your rpm's get up around 1500 or so, and if the engine is off, the battery is just getting drained and that's always bad.<br>  A good, deep-cycle battery, like a optima yellow top or a kinetic is probably your best bet. I doubt you'd need the big 3 for that kind of wattage.|`|F3szT9qlaa	The "Big 3" is a very easy mod to your car's electrical system that will help it maintain higher voltages for more power hungry amplifiers.<br>  <br>  500 watts really isn't all that much.. The big 3 is recommended for very strong amps. You can always check your amp an all for voltage drops to see if you need to do this. You should be fine, you could have just had a bad battery. Don't run your system when the car is off.|`|PvlpJ1IFaa	500 watts. Thats weak, if you're car battery can't handle that, then throw the battery away! Get Optima, Kinetic (I recommend), anything that can handle a little power. When you drive at night and you bump, you're lights dim and bright up again?  if so thats normal don't worry, if they dim and don't brighten up, your altinator is fucked. Another way, you start your car, drive, bump, shut car off and try to turn it back on and you're battery is dead, then your altenator is bad. <br>  <br>  If your just losing charge w.o playin music, its your battery AND altenator cuz its job is to start car and charge battery. 2 reasons its for..  but 500 watts shouldn't do anything harmful to your car. I'd have to look to see which one it is. but good luck and hope this helps|`|uL5772kCaa	The big 3 is suppose to take away some of the stress of your electrical in the car. It's always a good idea to do it since it's not that expensive and your car benefits from it.|`|tLilNlptaa	The big 3 upgrade is recommended for any car audio install, but 500 watts is probably not enough to cause major problems, if you have a good battery and alternator and your car is newer.
bkhvdfJxaa	its a rare car...and with propar tuning and mods, itll be quick...the celica alltrack is mainly used for rally racing...so keep that in mind...and it also uses the same motor thats inside the mr2 turbos..so you could source parts for it from there...|`|P9x8n16Taa	GREAT car, and very rare. 0-60 is about 7.9 seconds, and top speed is around 135. A decent paint job starts around $1000, and you should be able to find seats at a junkyard for $200 or so. Those are all ballpark numbers, it's hard to tell without seeing the car, but if it was mine, I would definitely invest a little money to get it back on the road. You won't see many of the All-Trac turbo's around.
Rwn0svq0aa	I own a 2005 Mazda 3 4 door.  I say get the car. It is the real deal. Let me qualify my opinion.  If you want a car that has a sporty attitude that can be customized the Mazda is a great candidate. If your emphasis is on handling and responsiveness, Mazda is the right car for you. If fuel efficiency is important, but not "thee" most important issue, you would be happy with a Mazda. I cannot recommend a car in it's price range that performs any better than the Mazda 3. Hands down it is an overall excellent vehicle.|`|MmboDcaJaa	If you feel that that's the car for you I say buy it. I drive a 07 Mazda 3 and I love everything about it. If the 2010 model works as well as the rest of the Mazda 3 family its a good car. My advice is wait for it to come out. Test drive it and see how you like it.
LdclkiILaa	I like the Toyota Yaris. I learnt to drive in one.. Its a nice, solid car which has great fuel economy. <br>  I currently have a Kia Picanto. They are quite cheap to buy but have a lot on them for the money, such as an mp3 player, air conditioning, electric windows etc... They have excellent fuel economy. I can go over to my brother's house in manchester from Leeds for around ￡5.50. Some of the newer models are only ￡35 to tax for a year.<br>  I also like the new corsa. They are well made and look cute but i have never actually driven one.<br>  Hope this helps a bit|`|zEP0lVkQaa	A volkswagon golf. It's very quick, great handling, and 6 speed manual transmission, and shifts very smoothly<br>  <br>  as for the toyota yaris its a piece of crap slow as hell <br>  <br>  hope I helped|`|kbGjEeoLaa	I would also agree with the VW Golf.  I have a VW Jetta which is pretty much the same car and I think its a great car.  I have had no problems with it so far.<br>  <br>  I would also add the subaru impreza to the list as well.  Subarus tend to last a long time, they are all wheel drive (AWD), and they are sporty.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for a vehicle that's a little more higher end, I would say the Audi A3. Its essentially the same thing as a VW Golf or Jetta.<br>  <br>  To help you research, you could go onto youtube and watch people review these cars, and you can also watch the crash test.
SGYmfWWdaa	My brother has a 2001 mustang that developed a knocking noise whenever he touched the gas.  Turns out the car had a cracked exhaust manifold.  I guess a cracked exhaust manifold is not that uncommon.  If this is the case with your car, I would suggest buying a new mainfold, but if money is tight, an exhaust shop can usually weld it shut for cheap.|`|8e1fdf4cefa581a57ec81fd9d7c68728aa	A rattling sound would be something loose, probably something in the exhaust. A knocking sound could be a lot of things. It could be a bad spark plug or a rod knock. Can you be more descriptive of the sound?|`|RtmfVevbaa	Try having your oil changed first, if that does not remedy the problem, sounds like you have a problem with your valves!!!!!!!!!! Change your oil every 3000 miles!!|`|kFsviR9waa	Might be loose exhaust , might be the timing chain , or the engine could be shot , you have to be more specific|`|AHygXkmfaa	Could be anything.

That fresh air intake duct has a drain tube, that is plugged up. Remove the cowl and find the fresh air intake and clean out that tube. Then it will drain again like it was designed. You or someone must park under trees or bushes. It this a Grand Cherokee? It seems that they plug up more then other cars do.<br>  <br>  EDIT: A faster way to get at it is to look under the dash on the passenger side, at the bottom of the heater box you will see the small black drain tube going out through the firewall.

AA11606818	All 5th generation preludes should use premium gasoline only.  Higher octane gasoline is used to prevent detonation at high RPM.  <br>  <br>  While you technically can use lower octane fuels (which it mentions in the owners manual) it is not recommended.  The ECU will retard timing to further avoid the risk of detonation which will cause decreased gas mileage/performance.|`|DV4xyeChaa	the engine was built for premium...that said regular will not kill it..the timing/computer adjusts for it...but you get less power and lower mpg due to retarded timing|`|qxSlQoRAaa	Probably best to use premium if thats what it calls for. The reason some manufacturers recommend premium fuel has to do with the design of the engine.   In an engine that has a higher compression ratio, many times premium fuel is necessary to avoid what they call "pinging" which is what occurs when the fuel combusts under compression. This is not good for your engine.  A higher octane fuel will resist the compression generated in a higher compression engine and will not combust unless met with a spark, which is what you want to happen.|`|OzLm0sF0aa	it wouldn't ruin the engine but it will drop your horsepower. there's a knock sensor inside that prevents the engine from detonating when you're running on cheaper gas.<br>  <br>  but yea, the prelude requires premium gas.|`|NDMesTasaa	It sounds like you should stick to premium.  It is probably designed to use a certain octane.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about the gas in it now, go to the auto part store and buy a bit of octane booster.

Your GPS will likely not be very accurate or have many features. but it's sort of a trade off. You get what you pay for. Tom tom's can be cheap, but are pretty good. Garmins are better, but they are a little more expensive. The SONY ones are also excellent and I would say they are every bit as good or better than the Garmins. I like the user interface alot better on the Sony. Perhaps if they like the GPS they got, and find it a little inacurate, then maybe they will upgrade once they relize how nice it would be to have a gps that actually works. I tried to buy a Jensen GPS once at a Canadian tire, and the guy said he wouldn't sell it to me because I was just going to bring it back to him in 3 days.

AA10747736	You are not very clear about your question. Are you asking how much you would pay for a mini cooper? Or are you asking what would be the rate for a loan? In general you will get what you pay for some will be cheap and others a lot of money. I will make the suggestion that if you are in the United States that you buy it at the BMW dealer. You may pay a little bit more for it but BMW isn't going to sell you a car that they do not feel comfortable with . The car is made by BMW and they do not want to sell a car that they might think would tarnish their image. there are a number of really good deals right now but interest may be high. <br>        I went to borrow money the other day I only have a house payment but my vehicles are paid for and I have no credit card debt. my fica is about 800 I wanted this from a bank that I have been doing business with over the last 36 years. I have check to bank with them and the only money that comes out of that is the house so I manage to have almost $400 going to savings each month. Their special rate to me was 13 1/4% that was the reduced version the reg. version was 13 1/2%  If you have cash you will make out nicely but if not you are not going to find a lot of money cheap it has dried up.
5BiBamrxaa	Even if you had fully comp. insurance it would not necessarily have allowed you to drive another car. A lot of companies are now dropping that from their policies.<br>  <br>  You are looking at 6 points and a large fine - minimum.<br>  It really depends on how the magistrates feel at the time and if there are any extenuating circumstances. <br>  The totting up process means if you get 12 points then it is a ban.|`|HXW4i5Ajaa	The best advice has already been given - get a solicitor. <br>  <br>  You are past the first two years - you would be on very shaky ground on five points and a licence less than two years as the threshold for a ban is six points for newly qualified drivers. your threshold is 12 points. <br>  <br>  Driving without insurance can carry a ban directly. As a first offence it would likely be 28 days.<br>  <br>  Remember as well that an early guitly plea often reduces a sentence. <br>  Hands up and accept what is given and it will be likely to hurt less.<br>  <br>  It is down to you to make sure you have insurance.

Insurers really do not like convictions for no insurance. Expect your renewal to go up. Read your insurance documents - do they say you need to tell them of impending prosecutions? You will definitely need to tell them on conviction.<br>  <br>  There is the option to claim exceptional hardship if it looks like a ban.

Otherwise---<br>  <br>  If your shifter lever is on the column, your most LIKELY problem is a defective turn signal switch, shorting out somewhere in the steering column (And this doesn't mean the column ITSELF is bad).<br>  <br>  If your shifter lever is on the floor, obviously the problem is not in the steering column.|`|1z9zl6kuaa	sry no idea abt this......|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	Pipline & joe have Great answers, one more thing I have seen is does this car have a trailer hitch?

RWjvcCYoaa	A GM Smartbuy allows you to trade the car in at the end of term or make one huge balloon payment and keep it. If you decide to trade it in, it works just the same as if you bought the car with normal financing. If your trade in value is less than what you owe, you'll have to pay the difference or roll it into another standard loan.<br>  <br>  A Smartbuy is very much like a Smartlease.

You have to buy it with a balloon payment or trade it in.|`|e5ad8f28c7ff22ef97eeb600f8c72b06aa	Sounds to me like you've got some dough.  If it were me and if the Caddy is in MINT shape, I'd drop it off to where you leased it, eat the penalty for returning it, then buy something else.  Never get mixed up in the tricky sales tactics though.  What I'm saying is that the dealer will tell you you cannot do it, but you can, and should.  Perhaps if you have a legal associate that can research your situation, then drive into the dealer with you, they'll be less likely to give the 'we can't take it back story'.  You'll pay a penalty, but think about it.... Either you buy out the remaining part of the lease, which might be an option, or if you don't want that, then give it back legally.  Make triple sure though that the dealer doesn't screw you by showing it later on your credit report as a repo.  They cannot do this if you return the vehicle and pay your early return penalty.  GOOD LUCK.
WNRKLK8Kaa	The Smart Lease contract is supposed to have a buyout amount on it.  And yes, it's likely higher than what the vehicle would be worth now at auction. so you need to talk to your dealer about your options.  GM has a Smart Lease Return Kit online...link below.  If you like the car enough and plan to keep it for awhile, see if you can purchase it as a Cadillac Certified Used Vehicle with the 6 year/100,000 mile warranty - it's only around $1000 dealer cost.  <br>   <br>  A Smart Buy contract is different...and your question makes it unclear which you have...if you have a Smart Buy contract, it's not a lease, but rather a short-term buy contract with a balloon payment at the end.  Your options for a Smart Buy are as follows:<br>  <br>  GMAC SMARTBUY<br>  SmartBuy may be an attractive alternative for customers who want to own a new vehicle every couple of years. SmartBuy offers convenient, flexible terms and monthly payments that can be lower than traditional financing with a final balloon payment.(1)<br>  <br>  SmartBuy can offer consumers many advantages:<br>  ? Lower monthly payments based on the portion of the vehicle expected to be used during the SmartBuy term (plus finance charge).<br>  ? Attractive options at the end of the contract:(2)<br>  <br>  ? Sell the vehicle to GMAC, pay a disposition fee and (if applicable) acquire a new GM vehicle.<br>  NOTE: Wisconsin does not allow a disposition fee.<br>  ? Make the final balloon payment,(3) sell the vehicle and keep any profit.<br>  ? Keep the vehicle and refinance the balloon payment.<br>  ? Keep the vehicle and make the final balloon payment. The customer owns the vehicle free and clear.(2)
HZGao294aa	Originally, VW used two brands of changers for the Passats, most however, were the National (Panasonic) brand that was a direct interface with the factory radio.  The factory unit is very expensive, I haven't installed one in a while, but seem to remember is was close to $500 for the unit including the mounting brackets and tax.<br>  <br>     Personally, I'd go with an aftermarket unit (non VW).  Many manufacturers make a unit that will work with your factory radio.  You might have to purchase a special interface cable or adapter so that the unit will work with your factory radio controls, but its not a difficult thing to do.  <br>  <br>      If you have some experience working with simple tools, you should be able to install the unit without any problem.  I'd check with a local stereo shop and see what they have available to work with your radio.<br>  You should be able to get a fully functional unit installed for $300 or less, depending upon brand and size of the changer.<br>  <br>     The previous writer recommended crutchfield, which can be a good place to start.  I've found them helpful in the past.<br>  <br>        Hope this helps, a car nut.|`|gsjjiRGFaa	contact your vw dealer to see if they have an optional changer for your passat. also try crutchfield.com, parts-express.com. they may each have what you need for a bit less. hope this helps

That means that you need to get at least $3000 cash to put down, or try to roll that negative onto the next car(s).  Doing that is almost never a good idea.  You drive off even more buried than when you showed up, and start a long-term loan all over again.<br>  <br>  Add to that the fact credit is very tight right now.  Its hard enough to get a loan with cash down.  Trying to get a loan with no cash down AND roll the negative from one car in, that is nearly impossible right now.<br>  <br>  IN a way, that is a good thing.  It will prevent people from burying themselves even deeper in cars.  Keep the Freestar, pay it off and drive it til it drops.  You will be far better off financially in the long run.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	You say your Freestar is worth about $6000...let's be honest here.

I suggest your try to sell your van you have now, then go look for two vehicles after the fact. The dealership is going to try to make money on your trade in- and also on the two vehicles you are buying. If you are not trading anything in, it gives you more bargaining power|`|PA7kYyAxaa	You are $3000 upside down. You need to know this. Contact several dealers, speak to them over the phone, explain your situation and see who seems likely to help you.<br>  <br>  You really need some cash into this deal. You're getting ready to complicate your situation by doubling your lack of equity. It's a bad idea to buy without cash and get over advanced on a car loan.<br>  <br>  It's best ot pay cash for cars, or just not buy|`|e5ad8f28c7ff22ef97eeb600f8c72b06aa	Why Why Why did you buy a Freestar in the first place?  What were you smoking?  Gosh, the salesman must have been a dooosey.  Freestar's are like the old PACERS, junk, junk, junk.   My recommendation is that you sell it yourself.  Try Craigslist; it's free.  DON'T TRADE IT IN, UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE YOUR ***, TROUSERS AND ALL.   GOOD LUCK.

16vMIGPiaa	DO NOT use something abrasive like steel wool.  It'll just scratch the chrome.<br>  Get yourself some chrome polish like is used for car bumpers.  If the chrome is pitted, the polish will at least clean up the exhaust pipe, but it won't fix the pits.  You'll have to laquer the exhaust pipe (after it's been cleaned and polished) to stop the corrosion.|`|TZz1uPY2aa	It all depends if the rust has pitted the chrome. If it hasn't,which I doubt, SOS pads will take it off. And then something to protect it from happening again needs to be applied.|`|PmaB839Naa	Yes a SOS pad will work fine. Then wax but do not paint it will just burn off.

It will be a better/faster/better looking car than the Challenger.|`|033a5e91931aa693dfd0d410087ef5e8aa	Hi,<br>  I'm a Porsche owner, and I'm wondering if you have $150K as you claim to spend why are you buying little cheap toys?<br>  Albeit the Skyline has some potential, but don't you want a real car?  The $150K range has some really cool cars, and you could do better for your money.  Just wondering?  A GT3 could be had for that price range and it's waaaaaay more car...that is if you can handle it!?  In fact if you want a Dodge get a late Viper if money is not an issue.  In fact a GT-40 could be had too with that money, so again I ask why don't you want some real muscle and speed with some flare too?|`|kbGjEeoLaa	I think one of the main difference between these two cars is the fact that the Skyline has power and agility and the Challenger relies heavily on brute force horsepower. <br>  <br>  There are other cars fall into this price range.  Have you considered the C350AMG or a porsche 911?<br>  <br>  Well, good luck with your purchase.|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I would go with the nissan.

Buying a new car might give you piece of mind and not have to worry about it breaking down.|`|e5ad8f28c7ff22ef97eeb600f8c72b06aa	Hello little lady.  Jetta's are known for not necessarily transmission problems, but for stripping a toothed gear which connects your drive wheel (that's your drivers side - traction wheel) identified as an "AXLE BEAM".  Axle beams normally only last for 100,000 miles, then they snap or crack partially, giving drivers like yourself the feeling that the transmission is slipping.  <br>  <br>  If the mechanic is someone you really trust and you can trust what they're telling you, then maybe it is your transmission, BUT many a mechanic only replaces the cracked 'axle beam' and they charge you for a rebuilt transmission.  They'll say it's a rebuilt transmission and it can only be warrantied for up to 30 days.  Most times, if you get a new transmission installed, they'll give you a one year (MINIMUM) warranty included on it (this is routine).  If the mechanic doesn't want to give you any warranty at all, then RUN away from this type of service shop, I suspect all you've done is what I explained above, .... you broke you 'axle beam' on the traction wheel.  Get a second and even a third opinion on something like that.  $3,000 dallors is alot of money, hopefully you have towing included on your insurance or AAA.  Just have it towed to different shops if you cannot drive it.  Call your local chamber of commerce office if you're unsure about where to go and it's possible they can recommend a 'respectable repair facility.  Normally to replace an "axle beam" you should be charged approximently $30 for the axle beam  and the labor to install it is approx. 2 hours.  Most shops charge $75 an hour, so $180 total plus tax and gear oil etc.  maybe max $200 repair.  GOOD LUCK.

Once you get comfortable riding after a week or two you'll wish you had gotten a 500 or 600. A 500 or 600 will hold you over for a year or two. There are so manhy ninja 250's on the market from people who bought them and got sick of them it will be hard to sell it too. <br>  <br>  Personally I don't see any reason to have an R1 unless you live in a rural area. In a city you'll never have the chance to use all that power anyway so why pay the money for it? Also, I am guessing you are on the younger side, if that's the case an R1 will cost you several thousand dollars a year in insurance. I'm younger but ride a cruiser and only pay $350 although even a 600cc wouldn't be too bad on insurance.|`|W5epU2Eaaa	i smell a squid|`|t2rUhyANaa	The step will feel ginormous. On a 250 you will get used to wringing the throtle to maximum in order to extract the last bit of performance. The first time you will do this on an R1 you will feel as if it's trying to pull your arms out of their sockets and might actually wrest the bars out of your hands if you're not careful. The same is true of the brakes. You will bang your helmet against the fairing the first time you will use them in anger.  <br>  <br>  You will quickly adapt to all the extra performance as long as you take the time to learn to ride your 250 really well because, in the end, the training matters a lot more than the actual hardware.|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	you'll be ok...after all its the rider who determines the speed of the bike...it will only go as fast as you want it to...|`|lsjMmZuiaa	it's possible, but not advisable.<br>  <br>  consider that you're going from around 30hp to more like 160hp...<br>  <br>  in car terms, this would be like driving a ford escort for a year, and then getting a Ferrari Enzo - except the Ezno won't fall over, or loop you off of it if you hit the gas too hard.<br>  <br>  I rode a 500 for 2 years, then bought a 600.  I ride the 600 at the track about one weekend a month, and on the demo ride I took on a 2008 R1, I would not have felt comfortable riding one on the street without a lot more practice.<br>  <br>  You'll have a much easier ride if you work up to the R1 slowly.  Yeah, it's the rider who determines how much gas you give it, but do you really want to give yourself hte option to make a 160hp mistake?|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	Huge step. don't recommend it. probably an increase of 130 hp. the R1 will go as fast in first gear as the 250 will go! do an intermediate step to the R6 - that's even a huge jump - since they are now 120 hp motors.|`|AA11119636	if you're planning to buy an R1...and have experience on a bike<br>  I'd start with a R6...then after 1~2 yrs riding move up to R1<br>  <br>  if you don't have any experience on the bike...I'd STRONGLY suggest you take a beginner rider's course (MSF) ... get the 250R ninja still get the R6 first....then R1<br>  <br>  R1 is definitely not for a beginner|`|miyAb7cQaa	I'd move up to a 600 or 750 before I jumped up to a liter bike if I were you.

9ee6ddc38b0329a7f432890bc9b58804aa	Kelly Blue Book lists a vehicle like yours as having less than 700.00 of value. It's got some pretty high milage and the custom touches add zero value unless you find the right buyer. The electrical issue would be a major problem on the used car market. very few buyers would want to assume that problem especially women.<br>  <br>  The 700.00 price is as a Trade in<br>  KBB.com lists it at about 1,900.00 as a private sale.<br>  <br>  In this poor market the value of 700.00 is probably more realistic. If you fix the electrical issue you might get closer to 1,500.00 if you can find someone who likes the look of the wheels, and appreciates the performance mods.

It just depends if you want a more flat look,Rustoleum or the shiny look.
