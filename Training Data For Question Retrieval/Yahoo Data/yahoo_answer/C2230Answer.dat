xvey8ixPaa	Just keep in mind that they are almost old enough to not need a babysitter, so they might kind of resent your being there. Ask them what they would like to do. See if you can get permission from their mom to drive them some places in your area like the pool, the beach, or to the park to shoot hoops or to the library. Maybe you three could sign up to do some volunteer work at a loca art gallery, the library, the animal shelter, or something like that, you would all be doing something worth while and have something for college and prefessional resumes. Find a cool or funky craft that guys like to do and do some art or crafts of some sort. You can also find some easy meals that you can teach them to make so that they can cook for their family and have some easy recipes up their sleeve. Check out some kids cookbooks and find some simple and fun things to make. Make sure you all three have bikes so you can bike around too. You cand make a schedule together and go for something fun everyday. I bet the time flies!

62042d42a5ab723efc5a5c42f4ff8051aa	Ok here are some really fun things to do-<br>  <br>  Flashlight tag- you can play this inside or out. If your inside turn of all the lights and if your outside make sure its dark. Give everyone a flash light. Then choose one person to be "it" Then it counts while everyone else runs and hides. Then if you get the light shined on you by it, your the new it. <br>  <br>  Truth or dare- As you probably know just one person asks another player truth or dare. If they fail to answer or complete the dare they cant ask anyone the next turn. Play this inside and out. Inside maybe more private but outside can bring some funny dares like stalk a pedestrian or do something weird while a car passes. <br>  <br>  charades- Get a hat, strips of paper and a pen. For this have every player right down a few things on different pieces of paper like people from your class, animals or movie stars. <br>  <br>  Would you rather- come up with two horrible choices like would you rather jump of the top of a sky liner or be trapped in a tank with 50 live snakes.  Or you could do two really good choices like would you rather win the lottery, or get to co-star in your favorite tv show. <br>  <br>  First asleep- once someone falls asleep this game can begin. Do dares such us tickle her nose. Or wack her with a pillow.  After a dare everyone should then run back into their sleeping bags and pretend to be asleep.<br>  <br>  Wrapping paper models- you need lots of wrapping paper and tape. Since three of you all could take turns being the model, designer, and judge. The designer takes the wrapping paper and creates an outfit on the model after, you can take pictures and then the judge gives it a score 1-10. Then you rotate. Judge becomes designer, designer becomes model and model becomes judge. Do this so everyone has a chance to be everything and then rip them off. Warning: this will make a big mess.<br>  <br>  3-way capture the flag- get 3 of the same items and then split each player into a part of the room or all different rooms. The point is to get all of the flags. What you have to do is go get someone else's flag and bring it back to your flag. If your flag is gone then someone else took it. Then you have to get your flag back. If you get to the other person's base and see yours and their flag you can only grab one, bring that flag back and then get the other flag. Then you may or may not have one. Depending on if any flags were stolen. Also players may tag another player and then send them to jail where they must count to 100. <br>  <br>  Giant game board- You have to have a basketball, chalk and a big amount of space. Make spaces with your friends out of chalk. This game makes you the actual player, so you can really get into the game. Base it off of one of your favorites or come up with your own. Instead of dice put numbers on the basket ball by using the chalk. Put them all in row on each of the little spaces on the ball. 8 should be the most you can move. If you just want to have 6, then the other two blank spaces could be lose a turn or go again. Instead of rolling the player bounces the ball and catching it, and which ever space on the basketball your right thumb is, is whatever spaces you move. <br>  <br>  <br>  This should keep you all entertained!|`|9Nw85MAdaa	"Honey I Love You..." was always my favorite!

648027ace1a4720fb2f2c005258439e1aa	First question: Yes. You can play abilities after blockers are declared and before damage is assigned.<br>  <br>  The combat is a long process, and it works like this:<br>  <br>  1) You announce that you are going to declare an attack. Both you and your opponent get a chance to play instants and abilities.<br>  2) You declare all the creatures that you are attacking with, and then tap them. Both you and your opponent get a chance to play instants and abilities.<br>  3) Your opponent declares how he/she is blocking the attackers. Both you and your opponent get a chance to play instants and abilities.<br>  4) Combat damage is put on the stack--at this point the damage that will be dealt is "locked in." Both you and your opponent get a chance to play instants and abilities. If you play an ability at this time that results in a creature's power changing or removing it from combat, it still deals as much damage as it would have before you played the spell.<br>  5) After combat damage resolves, both players again get a chance to play spells and abilities before your second (post-combat) main phase starts.<br>  <br>  Second question: Yes. A card that costs red and green mana to play counts as both red and green. So, for example, a red and green creature can't block something with Protection from Red; nor can it be targeted by Death Rattle, which says "Destroy target nongreen creature."<br>  <br>  Hybrid cards also count as all colors that appear as part of the hybrid symbol. For example, a card that costs three white/green hybrid mana counts as both white and green (even if you only spent one color of mana to play it, and even if you don't have the other color of mana in your deck at all).|`|X9kNbpnQaa	1) Yes. You both have the opportunity to play spells or abilities after blockers are declared but before damage is dealt.<br>  Look up "309. Declare Blockers Step" on my link for what I quoted. It's in the first paragraph.<br>  <br>  2) A card is all the colors that are listed in its cost. For hybrid cards they count as being both colors.|`|1vRegzdAaa	As long as the effect doesnt say it resolves or is activated as a sorcrey, then its considered an instant, and can be used a chain effect, so yes, u can activate it after they declare blockers, and they cant change blocker too :)<br>  <br>  Multicolored cards, for insteances, Sprouting Thrinax which is red, black, and green, are counted as all the colors they have. So Sprounting Thrinax cant be targeted by terror, but cant do damage to a card that has protection form red, green, or black. So yes.

It's just that when you play weaker players, they aren't able to exploit those things as well.<br>  <br>  Tactical weaknesses include an exposed King, a vulnerable back rank, unguarded pieces and pawns, pinned pieces and pawns, pieces on a line (subject to pins and skewers), pieces vulnerable to a possible Knight fork, pieces with no retreat, overworked defenders, unstable defenders, vulnerable vital guards, etc.<br>  <br>  Positial weaknesses include a restricted King, open lines toward the King, a cramped position, "bad" Bishops, isolated pawns, doubled pawns (which are a weakness, even though they create open files which can be exploited by a Rook), backward pawns, hanging pawns, "holes" in your pawn structure, weak squares, etc<br>  <br>  Obviously, there are a lot of things to look for on the board. Things you need to do, things you need to avoid, and things you need to force your opponent to do in order to create weaknesses, etc.  <br>  <br>  You need to be able to recognize these things from BOTH sides of the board.  In other words, you need to be able to properly analyze the board before you make your moves.  You need to consider King Safety,  Material Status, Possible tactics, Piece Placement and Mobility, Pawn Structure, Contorl of Important Squares and Tempi.   If you can properly understand these factors, you can analyze any chess position.<br>  <br>  If you have it in your budget to get some good chess books, "How to Reassess Your Chess" and "The Amateur's Mind" are excellent books by Jeremy Silman.   Another great series is Yasser Seirawan's "Winning Chess" series, which should be studied in the following order:<br>  <br>  1) Play Winning Chess<br>  2) Winning Chess Endings<br>  3) Winning Chess Tactics<br>  4) Winning Chess Strategies<br>  5) WInning Chess Combinations<br>  6) Winning Chess Brilliancies<br>  7) Winning Chess Openings<br>  <br>  <br>  Susan Polgar's "A World Champion's Guide to Chess" and "Chess Tactics for Champions" are excellent as well.<br>  <br>  "Win at Chess' is a good one-volume comprehensive chess course for the intermediate player. Author Ron Curry has been honored by the USCF for his teaching efforts. He's excellent.<br>  <br>  I would ESPECIALLY recommend Curry's book if you only want to buy ONE book to learn the game (at least, to start...you'll be needing more later on!  Don't think you can learn to be an excellent player from just one book!).<br>  <br>  "How to Play Good Opening Moves' by IGM Edmar Medinis is an excellent book on how to play good openings without "knowing" the openings.  It teaches the principles upon which all good openings are based, and it shows you how to play a good opening and achieve all opening objectives without having to spend hundreds of hours studying individual openings.  You shouldn't really be "studying" openings anyway unless you've mastered all other areas of the game, which haven't done yet (if you had, you wouldn't be asking this question).<br>  Openings should be the last thing anyone studies, and only then after mastering end and middle games first.<br>  <br>  Because of the (incredible) number of tactical mistakes made by "class level" players (i.e. players with below-expert skill levels), openings themselves don't mean anything, basically because any slight advantage obtained from playing a particular opening is thrown away in the middlegame because of tactical errors made when the class-level player is  (to quote Chessmaster) "out of opening book".<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck to you.  Tigran Petrosian is another player who's games you could study if you want to learn how to defend. The former World Champion was known as a player who was almost impossible to beat because of his defense and his careful consideration of his pawn structure.|`|PVR0y9eOaa	just keep practicing and trying harder<br>  maybe excercise your brain a lot too to help it start working faster<br>  hope it helps!|`|Qas05nZraa	learn some techniques in winning easily and practice hard|`|EHI3h65paa	I agree, get the book: art of defense in chess. <br>  It is a little advanced tho.

lQGDV7MEaa	In no specific order:<br>  Kingdom Hearts II (PS2), Halo 1 & 2 (storyline and online play, respectively; Xbox), Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker (GCN), and Super Smash Bros. Melee (GCN).
U4tzz6RTaa	I would pick Munchlax because the huge amount of HP and its a normal type and can learn almost all kinds of moves so it gets useful, and teach him earthquake to defeat dialgo unless you want to catch it then go ahead. I would choose Munchlax :)
bo4dGu7Waa	You cannot go on all the rides in Magic Kingdom park in one day.<br>  You will need at least two days including dining,<br>  If you are going one day, you can't even go on most of the rides.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, all rides are the best rides in Magic Kingdom.<br>  I don't like it when people meant thrill rides by best rides.<br>  <br>  Space Mountain has no loops.<br>  It is a thrill ride and is very fast.<br>  The drops are about the size of the one on Pirates of the Caribbean<br>  It is fun and will scare you while waiting. Once you are on it, you'll forget.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you're going to Space Mountain about right now, you can't because it is shut down right now for refurbishment.|`|8yAQjqRpaa	calm down ...and definately go on space mountain!|`|J08K6Fqeaa	I doubt that you can get on all of them. However, some may be skipped. If you are older than 10, then rides like the Dumbo ride could be missed since the same basic type of ride is available at any carnival or local amusement park. Also skip the "race" cars in Tomorrowland, since they aren't really race cars but just a boring ride a circle.<br>  <br>  Go buy "The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World 2009". This was the best $20 I spent for my family's July 2008 vacation to Disney. The book contains reviews for restaurants, hotels, and attractions on and off Disney property. However, the best part of the book are the touring plans! The plans give you step by step instructions on where to go and when to go in order to avoid the longest lines.<br>  <br>  Go out and buy the book today. I promise you will not be disappointed.<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|L9mYaNXPaa	There is probably no way you can go on all the rides...but if the park is open to 12 that day then maybe. You just need to know what rides are good for the age levels...if you have no young kids then you can probably do everything just skip fantasyland and toontown. The best ride in the Magic Kingdom is probably Splash Moutain...but there is a huge drop! Space Mountain is scary but not for me because I love roller coasters. There are no loops, alot of little drops and a few big drops...Have a GREAT time!!!!|`|vZaLptZWaa	If you stay in Magic Kingdom from open to close, you can definitely do everything in a day. <br>  <br>  Space Mountain is tame, but fun.|`|d2635e5d3253618c3db1335b418bad59aa	I recommend getting fast passes for most of the rides.  A fast pass is basically a reservation to ride the ride.  You get a ticket with a specific time on it that you can return and it shortens your wait.  Here's a website with some more info on the fast passes: <a href="http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/fastpass.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/fastpass....</a><br>  <br>  As far as going on all the rides, I think you should be able to. If you get there when the park opens, one trick is to tour the park from left to right.  Most people will turn right into Tomorrow land.  If you go left into Adventure land 1st you are working your way against the crowd.  You also will hit one of the most popular rides 1st by doing that : Pirates of the Caribbean.<br>  <br>  Space Mountain - Ok I am so NOT a roller coaster fan.  I hate them.  I honestly disklike this ride a lot.  From my perspective is an older ride that is VERY jerky.  There are no loops but there are quite a few drops, some big, some little, not sure how many of each. I dislike jerky coasters with drops, but that's me.   My husband ( a roller coaster fan) will tell you that its a mild coaster.  <br>  <br>  I know this sounds crazy, but I honestly like Rockin Roller coaster better.   It's SOOOOOOOO  MUCH smoother and it's so fast it doesn't bother me at all  - you don't realize if you're upside down or not.  Rockin Roller Coaster has loops, no drops at all.  But I promise, you don't realize you're upside down.  Remember, I hate roller coasters, but I love that one.  It is the ONLY one I like.    <br>  <br>  Overall have fun, relax and try not to worry.  Oh and don't miss the Epcot fireworks show Illuminations.  It's the best!<br>  <br>  Have Fun!|`|4Hr6Kh2Yaa	I **** in my pants in roller coasters but space mountain is nothing! <br>  it's so much fun ! you might need to get one of these, what you call them...? uuuhm quickpass thingies cause the lines are pretty long for the space mountain|`|lWUZkOazaa	Ok, i got one word for you.................

It's a good mix between arcadey gameplay and sim gameplay. <br>  <br>  Here's there average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/projectgothamracing4?q=project%20gotham%20racing%204" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 85% meaning it's a very good game.<br>  <br>  2. Forza Motorsport 2<br>  <br>  Forza Motorsport 2 is a hardcore simulator where you can tweak every aspect of your car until you're satisfied. And I found it boring after a while.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for this game:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/forzamotorsport2?q=forza%20motorsport%202" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 90% meaning it's a brilliant game, techinally better than Project Gotham Racing 4.<br>  <br>  I would go with Project Gotham Racing though because it's a lot more fun. I got bored of Forza Motorsport after a while because it seemed too samey, but PGR 4 is constantly fun because of the perfect car handling and exciting tracks.<br>  <br>  But I guess what you decide on getting really depends on what style of racing game you prefer, the hardcore simulator or the arcadey fun game.|`|5iIPROd5aa	Well it depends on wether or not you're a serious car game junkie or not.  Forza is more realistic and has infinite amounts of depth, which many car freaks would applaud. However, it might turn off others, saying that it is less of a game and more of a simulation, so it just depends on what your preference is.  I personally prefer PGR4|`|RjGxEWLFaa	Project Gotham Racing 4 By Far|`|cTJqaCcQaa	project gotham racing 4: the game has lots of positive reviews (excellent graphics, gameplay, etc) i have fonza motorsport 2 and it had some B+ reviews but i didnt enjoy it a lot, i would prefer project gotham racing 4

6c329e2a9a2625c2e42cfa6fed1184deaa	I reccommend Yu-Gi-Oh! The Eternal Duelist Soul for the GBA. Unlike alot of the other crappy versions (I'm looking at you Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses) it plays like a normal Yu-Gi-Oh game. You get a choice of a random deck and you battle it out just like the cartoon. Everytime you win, you gain 5 more cards. There are characters from the old Yu-Gi-Oh cartoon to play against. <br>  <br>  Even if you never played Yu-Gi-Oh, this game is easier to get into while maintaining a level of challenge for those who are hardcore. <br>  <br>  Just like the show, if you use your smarts, you can dismantle even the toughest of cards with the simplest of moves. <br>  <br>  To further help you, I've included a link to where you can read the reviews of other Yu-Gi-Oh games so you can compare.|`|AA10207751	Video games such as yu-gi-oh pretty much always have the same characters and graphics.<br>  If you really want to know the best, ask the employee selling the video games or your friends.|`|7aff29b7fbf0ecfdd2147a496ed57e76aa	I'm playing yu-gi-oh ultimate master edition on GBA, lots of cards, very tough opponents and no trivial storyline to go through.

And then when it collapses on the town - they show your death scene! I always "LOL" at that. The moon is also very angry all the time. I wonder what got his anger going?<br>  <br>  The sad part comes from the fact the two fairies are split from each other (close siblings too) and for the Skull Kid not having anyone to be friend's with. I always feel bad for the Skull Kid! It's not like he took Majora's Mask to be evil on purpose, it controlled him.

At Gamestation we get faulty drums back almost every other day. If you still have your receipt take it back from where you bought it, by law they have to replace it. If not if you paid by card get a transaction report, they can check the date on their system. Otherwise get in touch with Activision, they should replace it for you free of charge.

okk5t1FXaa	Fallout 3 is amazing, the nostalgia and futuristic feel blends so well. The main plot story is short, just as many of the next generation games, but like other next gen. games, there is immense subplots and side quests to indulge yourself in other than just the simple linear plotline.<br>  <br>  Pros: Fallout 3 has to be one of the best games of 2008. The game challenges you mostly in the beginning, as your grasping for your barings in the game, and barely scraping by. As you progress, and become experienced, the survivalism is second nature, which may be a bad thing as well. The graphics are great, and the character models run well except a few glitchy spots here and there at scarce times.<br>  <br>  Cons: Fallout 3, despite all the story-telling is almost completely linear, the game is black and white, your either good, bad or neutral, and nothing else.The main plot is short, and can be finished in probably 5 hours if your good enough. The game doesn't let you see much change in the wastelands either, it would be neat if they added in ways for you to actually start to rebuild civilization and the what not. The torn and mangled look of all the buildings may be fit for right after the war, but with all the technology they possess, I'd imagine after 200 years they would find a way to make their clothes and buildings look more professional.<br>  <br>  Altogether, Fallout 3 has many flaws, but with participation in side quests and taking your time with the story, the game is well worth playing.|`|Mb31azhQaa	ih have it and i thinks its kinda lame, all u do is walk around and talk to people, try to loot stuff all the time, keep running and it takes so long, hardly any action, all u do is keep looking for towns and people, im like wats the point of the game?|`|PpheQM2naa	I liked it,<br>  <br>  It is very open world and there is so many things to do, but beware if you beat the game your charecter will die and you be able to play, i think bethesda could have made this alot better then it is but i love it even though =]<br>  <br>  I would get it.... definatly|`|UmM9GvZsaa	Im kinda inbetween.<br>  I played only the Xbox360 Version, so anything I say about controls.. yaknow.<br>  <br>  <br>  It has really great atmosphere, everywhere you go you get the sense of running around a wasteland - in some cases this gets a little annoying when you run around and think "man, heres _nothing_", mostly though i conveys teh feeling of living in an utterly destroyed world really great esp. when you walk into the first real city.<br>  <br>  Graphics mostly good (remember, I only played 360), but (as in oblivion as this game uses the same engine) EVERY face looks ugly in a way, same as oblivion - you cant create a good looking character in this engine. Didnt bother me tho..<br>  <br>  I like the VATS shooting system ("freeze time", select target, announce number of shots to targetregion, "unfreeze time", watch the action unfold)  - you have x amount of action points and every action (shot) subtracts a portion of these points, when the points are depleted you have to leave vats and wait for the points to be regenerated.<br>  You can shoot out of vats thou at least for me on the xbox that was a real pain, as this game is not a shooter. not a shooter. not. shooter. (just wnated to make that clear 'cause thats 70% of why people say its a bad game - they play it as a shooter and not an rpg).<br>  <br>  Your inventory/maps/abilities/whatever is all a bit crammed into a too tight space, there are some good mods for pc out tho so this shouldnt hold you back.<br>  <br>  Oh, the only thing that really annoyed me in the beginning was the day/night cycle as you cant do jack in the night in a town and in the beginning of the game you just dont have your own place to sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  All in all I`d say its a vry good game, story is nice, if you are remotely into scifi/doomsday rpgs go for it. <br>  and hey. its the fallout universe. go for it.<br>  Oh, and the PipBoy-Radio is awesome! :)

If you go for 99 hunter it is guaranteed money, you wont have to rely and wait on other people to help you out on this one.

Going to GWD you would have to rely on luck and how many people are on your team.|`|d7JQS6qzaa	Yes 99 hunter is a good advantage. It is easy to lvl up..and it can be to your benefit. Think about this...99 hunter is a Box Trap and its 100-300 gp..but when you hunt red chinchompas they are 700 ea and are stackable! So its your money and your not waisting none.

6N3yjlXhaa	You can use knits when the pattern calls for woven, but not visa versa.<br>  <br>  You can usually go down one size.<br>  <br>  You need to stabilize the shoulder, pocket openings and waist if you are making pants..  You can use twill tape or a strip of the selvage from the fabric you are using.<br>  <br>  Use a ball-point needle to help eliminate the possibility of piercing a hole in the knit.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Certainly, you can use any kind of fabric you want.  But you need to know the characteristics of the fabric you are using.<br>  <br>  For example, knits are usually used because of the stretch factor.  Wovens don't stretch much in either direction, but possibly on the bias, but knits will stretch in all directions.  It is best suited for body-forming shapes, because of the stretch, and it tends to sag if there is weight on it.  So you may want to take that into account when designing your clothing.

Start with the easy stuff and get to the harder, more complex, and extremely awesome looking creations. They are great gifts once you get really good at some. I think most anyone can do it if they can follow instructions (But i have to admit, some are just written REALLY badly). I started in the 4th grade and it was easy for me.<br>  <br>  All you need is square paper (you may be able to to buy some precut, but otherwise just fold the top corner down till the edges are flat and then cut across the bottom, removing a long rectangle. The more square it is, the better.) Any size paper is good. You may be fimiliar with the paper crane already (or at least have seen it) well bored in class one day I made a paper crane that was half a centenmeter tall when i was finished (i lost it by the end of the day =( made me kinda sad) but I have also cut a peice of poster board into a square and made a dragon that is about 15 inches from head to tail with about that for its wingspan.<br>  <br>  Once you have the paper, you can go here <a href="http://www.origami-instructions.com/simple-origami.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.origami-instructions.com/simp...</a> for some good instructions and pictures. If you find Origami fun, you can visit your local book store and probabally find a book on origami there (there are some kits that also include paper too)<br>  <br>  Some helpful tips when making origami is to always make good creases. if you have longish fingernails (2 long makes it harder) you can run them along the edge and crease it that way (after you fold it and get the crease made, this is to make the crease stay better and make your origami look better) you can also use the back of a spoon, or the side of a pen or pencil, anything really. Try to get corners and edges to line up the best you can, it makes the results better. Finnially, if you don't do well on your first try, don't give up!<br>  <br>  Give it a go and i'll check back later, if you have a question about origami, just ask it under add details and i'll reply again. <br>  <br>  Hope ive helped, have fun!

iENoAA84aa	Hmmmm.....not a bad deck...I'd give you 6 out of 10. I guess 56 cards includes your side deck of 15?? <br>  <br>  I have a full zombie vampire deck also.......except mine would punish yours.....lol :)<br>  <br>  You really need a 2nd vampire genesis....or remove 1 of the vampire lords (its a very weak tribute monster unless its being removed for genesis). I know ryu kokki is a relatively strong card....but i'd replace it with vampires curse (2500 atk on return). Then it;ll be a real vampire deck. Swap 3 regen mummy for 3 zombie masters. Obviously you need a mezuki....and where is spirit reaper? (a must have cheap card). I also play a grand neo spacian mole. These two cards are awesome defenders. Marshmallon would also help here.<br>  <br>  Playing 3 lightning vortex is crazy....1 is enough. Call of the mummy is also a must have spell card. I'd also have a MST....and definitely a Monster Reincarnation (this will get vampire genesis back from the graveyard to your hand for further summoning). I think 2 Book of life is enough....there is a million other ways to special summon zombies.<br>  <br>  You need to replace the trap holes......they are weak and dont stop special summoning. Try bottomless traphole...or even sak armors. Solemns are best....but they are very expensive.<br>  <br>  Guess I sound a little critical....but I'm just trying to help. <br>  <br>  Still....all this said......your deck will hammer any single structure deck on the market today.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the Yu-Gi-Oh :)|`|TOilCuG3aa	keep it at 40 cards<br>  <br>  dont use more than 19 monsters<br>  <br>  6/10
5iIPROd5aa	I would have to go with guitar hero if I were you. I also am a huge fan of COD4 and regard it as one of the greatest things ever made, so when I got news of the next COD installment, I just about wet myself.  But, sadly, when I finally got it I was very dissappointed.  I had not realized initially that it had been developed by Treyarch instead of Infinity Ward, and the difference is very widely apparent, as they clearly don't have the same amount of finesse.  Now I'm not going to say that WAW is a bad game by any means, it's just nowhere near as good as COD4|`|4AavBJy8aa	guitar hero  dont get me wrong  cod 5 is an amazing game but  you will end up wanting to go back to cod 4 as it set in the present|`|GDqitbgsaa	world tour becuase it is cool and has the drums man. rock on rocker socker. mr falker stop looking at my cat.|`|L8uq8VVTaa	cod 5|`|RXrDWms0aa	Honestly, if you already have CoD4, you may end up playing it more than 5 after a while, thats what happened to me anyway.

(like so many people do in cod5) also on the 360 you get a lot of young children shouting screaming down their mics  shouting abuse at you just for speaking (one reason i got rid of cod4) go for something abit different and get guitar hero and if you really  want cod5 then in a few weeks buy that.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|AA11558033	i say go with COD5 cos there's multiple levels compared GHWT. u will be playing those songs over and over again. no challenge in that unless u go waste your xbox points on some other new songs.|`|913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	My grandsons have both these games...they had Call of Duty 4 first.<br>  They like both but one grandson still prefers Call of Duty 4 to Call of Duty 5.

AA11850311	Moving your Sims2 folder to your desktop removed all the custom content from your game.  Since the game plays fine with no custom content, you obviously have a bad or incompatible piece.  You can put the custom content a few pieces at time back into your Documents/EA Games/The Sims 2/Downloads folder, loading the game between each add in to make sure it still runs.  When it stops working, you will know that one of the pieces in the last group is causing your problem.

cO10thlnaa	Doubtful. There are two ways that Pokemon are obtained in events:<br>  Key item distribution<br>  Pokemon distribution<br>  <br>  With key item distribution such as the original Shaymin and Darkrai events, you have the opportunity to encounter these Pokemon in the wild, which results in random generation of every aspect of it's stats based on the species. These include its IVs, Nature, Ability when applicable and of course, Shiny status. <br>  <br>  However, this Regigigas event gives you the Pokemon directly from a Distribution Cartridge. Any Pokemon on a Distrib. Cart always has the same stats; Capture Ball (usually the Cherish Ball with events) OT/ID, nature, IVs and Shiny status.<br>  Some might argue that a starter or egg isn't technically a wild encounter, yet it has a chance to be shiny. This is because both have their stats and other attributes randomized to any possible combination for that species when you recieve it, including being shiny, just as a wild does when you encounter it.<br>  <br>  I have the ROM filedump for the distribution cartridges of Deoxys, Darkrai and Shaymin events for my CycloEvolution DS and have distributed each to multiple saves via Mystery Gift over wireless just as it is done at events. <br>  <br>  Upon checking each Pokemon's attributes from each save inside PokeSav, all have the same exact attributes: IVs, Nature and all. None of them were different in any way, except for the PID which is randomized for every pokemon generated.<br>  <br>  In short, no. There is no possible way for it to be shiny as it is just the same, static monster sent out to everybody.|`|qZCzlkL1aa	I believe it is possible to get any pokemon from an event i.e. Dialga, Palkia, Azelf etc. exept for Cresselia and Mesprit, Cresselia and Mesprit because you have to find them, by soft resetting......Because like starters (in other games like gold and silver) you can see them in game and can save in front of them so in conclusion, yes you can.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	Well, for one, even if you were able to try 8000 times, it wouldn't work. the formula resets after each encounter. So, you get regi and go to the guy in the mart...you get a 1/8000 chance it will be shiny. You soft reset, and go to the guy in the mart, another 1/8000 chance. and so on. Each encounter is a 1/8000 chance.<br>  <br>  1 time or 1 million times, each encounter is a single 1/8000 chance.

Good luck. =)|`|oC08FheOaa	yes|`|DJoQnwNbaa	of course you do you need to download everygame u play unless its a flash game for flash games all u need to download is a flash player unless ur computer already has one if u want a fun free flash game search territory wars or u can click on this link <a href="http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/two" rel="nofollow">http://www.xgenstudios.com/play/two</a>|`|rrGc9HC3aa	Yes you do

(400m in the JP version) in the Home-Run Contest. To do such, stand next to the Sandbag and TAP the X or Y buttons to jump, then use the Down + A move to hit the bag for around 30% damage each time. Do that about 4 times to get the bag up to around 100-110% damage. Since you won't have much time left, get the bat and use a Smash hit to send the bag flying. If you did it all well enough, you should make it well over the required distance.<br>  <br>  Unlock events #40 through #50<br>  To unlock events #40 through #50, you must unlock all of the secret characters.<br>  <br>  Wallpapers | GamingUpdate.com - Game news feeds and forums | Juegoz.com - Trucos en Espa?ol <br>  .:Login:.<br>  username:password:<br>  <br>   Remember me  <br>  Sign up now! | Resend Details <br>   Home PlayStation 2 PlayStation 3 PS PSP PC XBOX Xbox 360 Wii Gamecube GB GBA N64 Nintendo DS DC DVD Arcade NEW: VIDEOS Expert Guides SF IV!

gfmTgLDKaa	They're not of the same genre, Sims is simulation and WOW is mmorpg. You can't compare the two, it really depends on your taste.<br>  <br>  Sims 3 is gonna be good, if you liked Sims 2, then your gonna love Sims 3, I guarantee it.<br>  <br>  WOW and Sims 3 has different goals, and their both really fun.<br>  <br>  Enjoy :D|`|DU8zxsKRaa	I don't really see how the two games can be comparible to each other.|`|3Nm1FOJ1aa	These two games are completely different. WoW is a MMORPG and sims is just sims lol. I play WoW so of course I'm going to say that WoW is better. Gogo WoW yay.|`|mg2BJbeAaa	Basically, if you have a strong internet connection or like social interaction or working towards a goal, go with WoW.<br>  If you have a weak internet connection or prefer to be left alone or like to endlessly customize every detail, go with Sims 3.<br>  Or just get both. You probably will anyways.|`|Syvig9Q9aa	If you like Sims 2 more than WoW then Sims 3 will probably also be better.<br>  <br>  in my absolutely fabulous, honest opinion, WoW is far better in terms of pure fun etc.|`|b0DXZiwCaa	same with llaffer but world of warcraft is better|`|36YoeltMaa	i dont like either. but i would have to say that WOW is better based on the number of players and the amount of content constantly added to the game.
cO10thlnaa	Get the key from the Green Guy in the PokeMart, go to Canalave City and go to the inn that is usually locked (Right side of the city, up near the water). Your character will go to sleep in the bed and you will see Darkrai in your dream, where you can battle and catch him.
YHgrZN0Xaa	Killzone 2 is very popular right now for online play, although it is by far not the best game ever made in the history of histories as the other person described lol...|`|jbkqTYRPaa	ps3 sucks balls watch both of these 2 vids to see why, <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfmBzllkbUM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfmBzllkb...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRH...</a>|`|ZlE4VBi3aa	The games I would recommand for you are : killzone 2 and cod4. All the other shooter games suck.|`|z4TdDnUMaa	i got both console, and i think cod4 is the only best online on ps3, xbox360 got quit a few that are good online games.|`|T6EUvapRaa	Halo and Gears of War. See where I'm going with this?|`|5WjdFqMXaa	got the answer for u... KILLZONE 2..<br>  Get it and be a witness<br>   <br>  of the best FPS every made<br>  <br>  <br>  .....and theres liek other modes than deathmatch and team deathmatch in Call Of Duty... theres search and destroy and headquarters and sabotage... so what r u talking bout... but yea Killzone 2
MqJYhuQ3aa	Millsberry probably?
T0QeVsMaaa	1 month, chores, massage feet, wash car
gfmTgLDKaa	They're practically the same, get whichever one is cheaper.
eEJGGEYjaa	i got him WAY WAY BACK, get action replay and do the walk through walls glitch, go to the edge of the mountain near the cave leading to elite 4. go in the place where u can only be after u beat them. go to the edge of the cliff with the rock and just go up for a long time.<br>  he appears at level 30|`|7AdXFnedaa	i think you catch a shaymion about lvl 40 (caint remeber been a while since i caught it legit) but unless you can find a friend to get it to you yes a AR is the only way to get it. if you use the right code(most of them work) youll be perfectly fine. just be sure to get the "oaks letter" for the event. it will take you to the route right next to the pokemon league to a shiney rock oak will ask you to inscribe a name on the rock then flowers will bloom like mad around you and shaymin will walk down. shaymin will spot you and oak and run up the sunset path. warning its very long so ride your bike right up to shaymin at the end and catch it|`|9sFwtEiwaa	actuallt u can cheat with action replay or by the event which past already or by getting oak's letter|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The only legit way is to get one through trade. Your out of luck. Your only other option is to cheat.|`|EUaIGX0Gaa	You can get by a Action Replay or R4, or you can get it in the movie Premier Of Garatina and the Sky Warror which will come out soon on DVD, and to get this is to go to Toy-R-Us and use the Mystre Gift to get the event.<br>  I prefer to get a real shaymin than hack and have a fake on<br>  <br>  Hope this helped <br>  Mip
mOTCr8Pxaa	Shut down your firewall. You will have to reset your wi-fi in your pokemon game. See the wi-fi points and numbers and stuff are programmed into the pokemon game. When somthing like a password is changed those numbers won't match and therefore you cannot get on. You will have to go to your wi-fi setup main menu item in your pokemon game. Remove your existing setup and setup a new one.|`|7AdXFnedaa	fidn the WEp key out (ask the person who set it up) and you should be fine|`|N8C9sEQDaa	About GTS in Pokemon Diamond can be read in <a href="http://super-info-blog.blogspot.com/?q=GTS%20in%20Pokemon%20Diamond" rel="nofollow">http://super-info-blog.blogspot.com/?q=G...</a>|`|ztugmTttaa	In the main menu, switch wi-fi profiles (yes, you'll still need to find out the new WEP key)

jhXBFN8Oaa	Sorry mate but dial up just won't cut it for xbox live. Any ways you won't be able to connect your xbox or 360 to your modem because it's different ports. It needs to be both ethernet. Even if you coils connect there would be way too much lag. Cheers|`|ZAQCvcIyaa	You are going to get lag no matter what with dial-up.  You need either a cable modem or DSL. I have been playing on xbox live for 5 years and never heard of anyone having dial-up. It's not possible.
br1FB5rraa	Yea, I had the same problem with mine. I guess when xbox released the 360 they were trying to get It out the same time that the ps3 came out, but when they did that, it wasn't finished. So everyone is having problems. But you can send it in and they will send you a new one. That's what I did|`|ZcAzvwFWaa	Play less lol...
C8DOT8Y7aa	Sorry I don't know that game

dRxi33u2aa	You could probably make clothes for them.If one of your family members knows how to sew,ask them to measure your webkinz and ask them to make clothes for them.I am asking my next door neighbor to make me clothes and she has already made like 2 outfits.Oh and by the way,you can get the fabric at many stores like Wal-Mart and Hancock.|`|Jff2i7msaa	well, i made hats for all of my webkinz once!!! i just got some paper, cut it into the shape of a party hat, wrote their names on it, decorated it, rolled it into the shape of the party hat, put tape on it to keep it together, then put on their heads! to keep the hat on them, you can just use a little piece of tape and stick it on there. it worked for me!!! hope this helps!!!!    = ] <br>  <br>  p.s. you might want to measure their heads to make them fit right!!!!|`|wUmJaLDcaa	How about a wand or something for them to hold.  I love Webkinz as well.
A2uxrHG1aa	get a gengar and make sure he keeps hypnosis, thats a common mistake, comin out first with hypnosis sets the tone for the whole battle. I also like brellom (With spore tho its hard to get) and heracross, Infernapes good. Starmies good but you have to be dedicated to him, best one is all TMs (Psychic, thunderbolt, ice beam, surf) And you could round it off with a Tyranitar, Dragonite, Garchomp, or Salamence.<br>  <br>  of corse all of these would be at their baby versions.<br>  <br>   Check smogon.com strategy pokedex for the move sets|`|fe7119b7b0b0139dbba639977251bf7daa	if your starting out you could have piplup, starly, luxray, bidoof, budew, and geodude.<br>  chimchar, starly, zubat, luxray, machop, and abra (level him up because he only knows teleport.<br>  turtwig, bidoof, luxray, starly, geodude, and abra

Although there are lots of other sites, I chose this because it is really easy for beginners to play online poker on this site..There are lots of freerolls every few hours, the community is nice and huge so you can discuss your issues if any..and its totally legitimate..|`|bJt2fYHSaa	I've been playing poker online for a while. The sites are pretty good. One thing I found is a site that just opened up called allinspot poker. It gives you four free dollars worth of game money and there is almost nobody on the site. You can create your own tourneys too. The website is www.allinspot.com hope this helps.
FdZySYsiaa	Well sims can be tricky i still don't understand which disc's i half to put in after i install them but if its asking for apartment life you will need it. :( You could try installing another sims 2 expansion pack or sims 2 stuff pack. It will cost you money but you MIGHT be able to play sims again.|`|kDdjf4qRaa	do not know so sorry try googleing it

msMDvcbQaa	there's the statue of happiness, leone's old mansion on the third island, time square. Then that's it I think. But if you want to reminise about the other games there is the mini golf course right by the first island bowling alley and you'll find some things like the world's biggest **** statue(GTA:SA) or the hippo(Manhunt) etc etc|`|iWSRZNv5aa	I wouldn't count on seeing anything familiar from gta 3,after all,liberty city is basically nyc,and if i remember correctly they made up their own islands in gta 3,I might be wrong though.|`|ECwPsFj3aa	The Only thing i see is the statue of happiness
83afe7Dvaa	I would make a frame out of chicken wire (wrapping the edges and arm holes with foam so it doesn't scratch you) and then wrapping that with batting from the fabric store. You can spray paint it the color of your choice.

j6MvCr6Naa	To activate a Skull (Silver or Gold) you need to go into the Campaign Lobby, then press "X" before choosing a level, you will get a screen where you can activate any Skulls that you have found. From here you will also be able to activate Campaign Scoring to get points while you play (there are Achievements for getting a certain amount of points for each level).<br>  <br>  Have Fun.<br>  <br>  If you need anything else, feel free to contact me.|`|pW5pGNTZaa	I forgot how to get to it, but theres a screen that shows all of the skulls, it shows the ones you do have, the ones you don't and lets you activate them.

udNWfgRnaa	PSP supports only MP4-AVC video, not general MP4 video, please make sure your video is compatible with PSP. Assume your video has the right format, you just need to format your memory stick, then copy the mp4 video to the "Video" folder in your psp memory stick, done. If you don't have the video folder, just create it by yourself. If you want to know how to convert DVD and video to PSP compatible video, I'd recommend this step by step guide to you, it works pretty well for me.<br>  <a href="http://www.freedvdripper.net/guides/put-dvd-video-to-psp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedvdripper.net/guides/put-...</a><br>  You can visit PSP official website to learn more info: <a href="http://www.psp.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.psp.com</a><br>  Hope it helps.

Greed has Roman ending up dead, and Revenge has Kate ending up dead (at least that's what I've read, I've only done greed so far). Or, if you saved before selecting greed, and didn't save over it, you can simply reload from that save, select one, save it on a different one, then repeat for the other.

j6MvCr6Naa	Yes you can still get your Highest Skill higher, but you won't get EXP for winning.
ORZBejxWaa	Here's the answer i've been saying to multiple players : tactics-<br>  <br>  1.) tactics<br>  i.) always watch your enemy, when you see them walking around a corner towards you, try throwing a grenade at them-if you can do it they're at no shields normally.<br>  ii.) if someone is chasing you-RIGHT BEHIND you, throw a grenade at your feet and jump-but not in front of you, when you look at the very bottom-as far down as you can. this normally gets them to no shields too.-if you can, do it on the corner of a door, and turn around and melee them. works like a charm for me.<br>  iii.) SNIPER IS YOUR BEST FRIEND AND WORST ENEMY-if you're good with the sniper, i mean GOOD, not you think your good but actually are good, then use it. if your not GOOD, but can easily manage body shots, use it as well, a quick body shot and a quick shot to the face with a BR give you an easy kill. However, it is also your worst enemy due to the fact that your opponents have access to them and while you are engrossed in an engagement with an opponent, their sniper may kill you. <br>  iv.) always rush rockets/camoflauge/overshield/power weapons in the beginning of the game. You NEED to start strong in a game in order to stay strong. This holds true ESPECIALLY for team SLAYER, i mean when the gametype shows up and it says team slayer(not team brs). Otherwise the opponent team might just get rockets over and over again and keep spawn killing you with them or a sniper-and you'll be helpless because you only have an assualt rifle. <br>  V.) If you can't use a weapon, and you Know the other team can, waste it. This is key in winning some matches. If your playing a pro sniper team for example, waste the sniper or if you just picked up rockets but are getting shot and know you won't live, just jump off the edge or waste it. Remember, you DON'T want them to use the power weapons.<br>  <br>  VI.) PAIR UP! remember, play 1v1s or 2v2s against people better than yourself and you may learn a thing or two about how to stop good players in their tracks. <br>  <br>  VII.) MLG-THE BEST BR PRACTICE EVER. Also, you learn tactics from playing mlg, like how to rush someone's team and callouts. <br>  <br>  VIII.)PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE! If you find some types of games that you aren't very good at, play those and get better. Also, you can practice if you're all alone by keeping another controller signed in. practice learning grenade throwing, like off the walls, and how far they go when you throw it across the map. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  If you want some more help, like on xbox live-e-mail me at darealsunny@gmail.com. I'll tell you my gamertag if you e-mail me. Sorry I can't tell you my gamertag-i keep leveling accouts to 50 and giving them to friends/selling them to people. so i'll tell you my account's name when i make it. Good Luck!!|`|mibcrpVFaa	Ok here is my strategy in Halo 3.  First of all always reload, you never want to get stuck without any bullets.  Two, really focus on aiming for the head especially with the battle rifle which is in my opinion the most valuable weapon in the game.  Third, if your close to your oponent go for the beat down after you of course have weakened them for a little bit.  And finally the most important rule is to never stop moving, you don't want to make it easy for anyone to pick you off from afar and get a cheap kill plus it's just all around harder to hit you. Hope this helps you in the war against the covenant lol.|`|exZGdQBRaa	well first off your going to want to try the noob combo (plasma pistol and eithor plasma rifle,brute shot, or smg) and charge your plasma pistol and then shoot them down with the second gun.  after you get really good at this try to battle rifle more often, but dont completely relly  on gun bashes because its not always best that 1 wrong move can get you screwed over compeletely, try playing matches that are headshots only to train in those, a headshot is your best friend for sure. also play the campaign alot it really helps|`|xrp88kKAaa	Practice playing against friends and familiarize yourself with all weapons and maps.<br>  <br>  Play online and get experience, you can't start off being great when your a noob.<br>  <br>  The noob combo(plasma/battle rifle trick) is cheap and won't get you far, it works well in halo2 but not 3.<br>  <br>  Always aim for the head, and try suicide bombing(using plasma nades against someone when you know he/she is going to kill you.)<br>  <br>  Over some time youll get better and be pwning people.<br>  <br>  Helpful tip- Remeber anything goes in love and --->war<---<br>  <br>  Following these steps is what made me good at this game.|`|edhs8ozAaa	Start using the Battle Rifle if you are familiar with the weapon and aim for the head. Don't be afraid to use rockets, shotgun or hammer or sword. People will call u noob but u shouldn't care anyway. Assault Rifle, dual wield spikers, Smg's are all deadly close range so that's a suggestion. When using BR or sniper, aim for the head if you need help play team slayer and you'll get experience. learn to use gearnades and don't fall for when enemies are throwing gernades around your area just stay back hope i helped|`|m26JkOvLaa	dual needlers

sWKGUPziaa	I found this on the web. I hope it helps. If I find more I will add it.<br>  If you want to build your own lot Down Town, you get there from the neighborhood screen. You can not build when you are there with one of your Sims. Building in Down Town is similar to building in your neighborhood. You select floors, walls, and items to use. Some items, however, can ONLY be used Down Town. The hot dog stand is an example of this. There are a handful of important rules to know if you plan to build successfully Down Town. Certain types of buildings need certain employees. You don't need to worry about that directly but you do have to buy certain items that are important to the business. When you build a restaurant, putting in a sink will hire a dish washer and a podium will hire waiters. Clothing stores must have cash registers to hire cashiers.

0dtMfPYdaa	Features of each Sims 2 expansion pack will be in The Sims 3. Other features will be included in later expansion packs. For example, cell phones from Sims 2 University will be included, but the actual university/college won't. Most things from Nightlife will be included, without the vampires. There won't be any pets from Sims 2 Pets, nor will there be any seasons from Sims 2 Seasons. I think there will still be weather but I am not totally sure. In The Sims 3, there will be no Open for Business like things, that will probably come in a later expansion. There will not be vacations from Bon Voyage, but there will be jewelery. From Apartment Life there will not be any apartments, but other things from the game will be in it like ceilings.|`|2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	well, they will take some small things from the expansions like cars, cell phones, music and education careers, fishing, gardening, etc. this is what i know about businesses: <br>  "Something new to me (and most likely you) is the fact that your Sim can buy into the partnership of these Community Lots. It's costly (around §7,000) but your Sim will then earn an income from that Lot. They can then go on to buy out other partners until they eventually own the business (at a cost of around §20,000). Once you own the company you can rename it, fire the staff if you don't like them and make use of its facilities for free, so free food or books or movies. You can eventually buy up many or all of the properties and have a Monopoly of the town, but given the huge expense this would be something you might aspire to later in Sim life when you have lots of funds and fulfilled many wants."<br>  <a href="http://www.thesimsresource.com/blog/CreatorCampDayThree1530" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesimsresource.com/blog/Crea...</a>|`|QiFj52Icaa	Well, i can't exactly understand what you mean. But, if your asking if the Sims 2 Stuff is gonna be in the Sims 3, the Sims 2 stuff won't be in the Sims 3 probably, because it's the Sims 3! They made the Sims 3 so there could be more stuff. <br>  But, if your not talking about that, here's one that you might be asking.<br>  Do you mean " are they gonna put One of the Sims 2 expansion packs on The Sims 3?" (for example: are they gonna make a Sims 3 Nightlife?)<br>  <br>  But then again, I might be really really wrong.

j6MvCr6Naa	No, it doesn't matter what difficulty you access them on. It's something else, when you access a Terminal you will see it go past all these blue cell type things until it stops and goes into a file. Well, what most people do, is leave the Terminal after that happens. What you should do is wait a little bit and the Terminal will start going through the blue cells again and go into another (the second one) file. Now you can leave the Terminal, you also have to do this (as in wait for it to go to the seconf file too) with every Terminal or you won't get the Achievement.|`|jkZWhpquaa	My little brother had the same problem.<br>  Access them all in either solo or co-op, you can't mix the two, and finish with the one on halo.<br>  Check out this link!<br>  <a href="http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=1056120" rel="nofollow">http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=10...</a><br>  You can get all kinds of free stuff, from videogames, to clothes, to books! It isn't a scam, I swear!|`|CzRLhrOTaa	For the terminals you have to play on any difficulty higher than Easy. You have to wait until the end of the writing then exit (there is a little arrow in on the bottom of the screen, once it turns from blue to red that means that the script is done) You also have to access the terminals in order. So the 3 on the Ark, then the 3 on the Covenant, then the final one on Halo. Once you do that you should get the achievement.|`|4IwVNpJ7aa	You have to access the terminals on a higher difficulty. It might be Legendary but I heard it also works on Normal or higher. Just not on Easy.

Z2EzfQFvaa	Only if you want to.Some people see it as just another Donkey Kong game with no specialties...others see it as a DK game that could be on a top 10 list.I have mixed reviews too...but over all its a fantastic game.If your going to get it...make sure you have the N64 expansion pack....other wise you can't play it :)|`|lQGDV7MEaa	If you have the expansion pack, you should definitely go for it. I personally enjoyed it as a child, but I haven't played it in several years.|`|sdv81QXfaa	Well, I've played that game, and owned it for quite a long time before I got rid of it, and let me just say a couple of negative and positive things about it.  I'll start with negative:  some of the bonus levels in that game were ridiculously difficult.  I was never able to beat it completely, because some of the bonuses just get to be borderline impossible.  And some of the regular challenges in the game were very difficult, too.  Also, when I had to get the Rareware coin and Nintendo coin from Cranky Kong by beating the classic arcade games, that too was insanely difficult.  The camera was also sometimes unruly and awkward.  If you like a good challenge, though, then I'll give you some positive pointers on the game.  In my opinion, aside from the three Donkey Kong Country games, Donkey Kong 64 was the best Donkey Kong game made.  And not all of the challenges and bonuses were so difficult; some of them were quite fun.  And flying around with Diddy's Rocketbarrels is pretty fun, too, though the camera can be a nuisance when using the Rocketbarrels to complete some challenges.  I would definitely encourage you to give it a try, but be prepared for a real challenge.|`|WoqukD0kaa	It's a pretty fun game, I liked it.

Xg6i8qX3aa	Yes you can but there are only certain games that are compatible, so visit <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/</a> backwardcompatibilitygameslist .htm to find which games can play|`|YlyN73Jnaa	Only if they are backwards compatable. Check GameStop and EBGames and see if any xbox games say (BC). If they do, they can be played on the xbox 360. At least that's what I think.|`|nIGKwfAQaa	I'm almost positive you can.
YMHsibG8aa	You cant but on chess.com you can.

lQGDV7MEaa	You should check out The World Ends With You. It's innovative gameplay brings action to both screens, it's text-heavy plotline is developed really well, and it's an enjoyable experience most DS owners should go through at least once.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for the old GBC games, check out GameStop, GameCrazy, or EB Games. They'll have them there, but you'll need a GameBoy Advance (non-micro) to play them.|`|Y6xanshEaa	Pokemon Platinum comes out this month,in 15 days.<br>  It's a sister game to the other 4th generation games(Diamond and Pearl),but it's much more better.<br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAMrtC4Ctzg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAMrtC4Ct...</a><br>  <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Platinum_Version" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/P...</a><br>  <br>  ..Hm,I'm unsure where you can buy them,but you can buy them online(try Amazon).<br>  <br>  Do you like simulation games? How about Harvest Moon Cute or Harvest Moon Island Of Happiness?<br>  Harvest Moon is a super fun farm simulation,but that's just the main objective. It's more like a life sim,you can befriend people,date people,etc. <br>  <br>  Do you own Animal Crossing Wild World yet,it's a fun life simulation where your town is filled with antromorphic animals. <br>  <br>  I've heard The World Ends With You is a fun rpg,it's from the creators of the Kingdom Hearts series but it's very different.<br>  <br>  Oh,and by the way,you can't play GB or GBC games on a DS. You need a GBA or  an SP to play them...Or a GB or GBC.|`|Qh95owjlaa	I would recommend, for a day-to-day experience, Animal Crossing: Wild World. For a more adventurous title, I would have to say The Legend Of Zelda: The Phantom Hourglass is a good pick. these are the games that I enjoy along with my pokemon diamond.|`|XD7s1VBkaa	If you wait 15 more days pokemon platinum will be coming out for nintendo ds<br>  <br>  It's hard to find the classic pokemon games anymore|`|LdCo6Kmeaa	places like Eb games or online
gfGsXVc3aa	The little green men store in Tomorrowland is the place to go, they sell Limited Edition Pins and Collectible Pins, as well as the Annual Passholder special Pins. If you are outside Disneyland sometimes the World of Disney Store in there Pin area has someone the ones I've looked for in the past. Also remember that on the Disney Pin Trader site <a href="http://eventservices.disney.go.com/pintrading/search/results?upcoming=true" rel="nofollow">http://eventservices.disney.go.com/pintr...</a> that you can also order them by clicking into it and emailing the place with your request, you could order a pin for WDW or Tokyo, anyway hope this helps and enjoy! *Jena
XxU94aKlaa	There are not cheats for the 360 version as there is for the PC version, though some glitches you can exploit:<br>  <br>  "Infinite XP (Pre-Patch):<br>  You can gain infinite XP if your speech skill is high enough.(My speech was about 30 at the time). Go to town called "Big Town" located north of Vault 101.If you spoke with a girl named Bittercup she should tell you about her dating exploits. After speaking with her, go into the house marked "Common House" and speak to a man named Pappy. There should be a speech skill dialogue option that says "You came here with Bittercup, right?" You will get XP every time you click it. (I got 6XP with each click). Continue to do this and you can rack up XP in mere seconds. Bethesda has not yet patched this glitch."<br>  <br>  "Sandman Glitch (Pre-Patch)<br>  This a glitch for getting infinite exp Steps: 1.) Reach level 10 with a sneak skill of 60 and get the Mr. Sandman perk. 2.) Go to Andale (south central part of the map) 3.) Wait until around 1am and go into the Smith house while they are sleeping. 4.) Go upstairs into the kid's bedroom 5.) Use sandman on him (crouch and select him and and use the first option) 6.)

wAiVxAKNaa	According to tip.it, you are level 93. It's going to be harder for you to do bosses unless you get your Strength up to 80 or so. <br>  <br>  It is not impossible for you to kill bosses, but it will be hard. I would recommend having a large team (FOR ANY BOSS), but Bandos is probably your best bet for a boss right now. Make sure that you get a tank with high defence to take the melee and range while you sit back and take only the range. Getting your prayer up will be huge as well because you won't have to take as many prayer potions.<br>  <a href="http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=bandos_stronghold.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=bandos...</a><br>  <br>  You can do Zamorak boss, but your Hitpoints level is not really high enough to withstand the boss' attacks, especially since he can hit around 49 and can combo attacks easily. Plus, Zamorak boss can drain prayer almost halfway with one strike. This is not going to be good for you if your tank messes up and the boss gets on you.<br>  <a href="http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=zamoraks_fortress.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=zamora...</a><br>  <br>  Sara boss is going to be extremely hard with low hitpoints because she can easily hit you for 50 in two swings, plus the minions are extremely powerful in Sara.<br>  <a href="http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=saradomins_encampment.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tip.it/runescape/?page=sarado...</a><br>  <br>  Armadyl is probably the hardest boss, and I would not attempt it without 80 HP and 80 Ranged, as well as a large team.
