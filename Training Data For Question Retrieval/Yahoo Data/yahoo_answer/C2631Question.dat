20090225152113AAhg4qk	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car doors not frozen but broken (not opening)?	OK, this is really frustrating. I've done everything to try to unfreeze my car doors (both of them) including heating with hair dryer, WD-40, etc. Nothing works. It's above freezing today and still they're not working.      I think the doors themselves have broken. This is a 1992 vehicle so I imagine the parts that cause the door to open may have initially been frozen but are now broken. I just want to get into my car so I can unlock the back doors and use them to get in (and obviously take the car in to get the front doors fixed)      How can I get into the car? Can I do it with a Slim Jim? Never used one before... do hardware stores sell them or are they not sold commercially? I feel like an idiot here, both doors breaking at the same time and me struggling like a fool to get into this stupid tin can!

The job is cool, but Palmdale not so much. Is it feasible (it's been done before, can be sustained) to commute from Santa Monica to Palmdale 5 days a week?  (get up at 5am, leave at 6am, arrive at work at 8am, 8-4:30pm, return at 630pm, sleep at 9am).  Possible?  This means 200 miles / day x 5 days x 4 weeks = 4000 miles / month x 12 = 48,000 miles a year.

20090128144447AA0lQqm	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I believe my steering rack MAY be bent. Need advice on possible solutions and outcomes?	I have a 2002 Nissan Spec V that slid into a curb recently. The steering wheel was vibrating between 60-70mph so I took it in for a rebalancing, which revealed that the wheels on the passenger side got bent, the front one fairly severely. Replaced all the wheels and the vibration problem is solved. However the day that I took the car in to get the wheels replaced, I noticed a tapping sound only as I progressively turned the wheels to the right at low speeds or while sitting still. This sound remained after the wheels were replaced. I jacked the car up for a look and I could clearly see the right side steering rack boot was torn on the outside seal and it had some trouble sliding smoothly as I turned the wheel.    An educated guess would say that I bent my steering rack when I hit that curb. I will have to get it replaced eventually, however I am tight on cash and need to do some high mileage driving next week. How bad is it to drive on it as is? What are the potential problems that could result? Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thanks.

20090128182115AAjqrRC	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Suzuki	My 2003 suzuki gsx-r 600 started idling roughly. any ideas?	It has 17,400 miles on it, but only 1000 put on in the last 4 months. It was recently serviced and I was told that I have to replace the oil filters and a few other things. Now, my motorcycle has run fine since then, with the exception of this past week. I've been thinking about anything that i am doing differently now than before and the only thing i can come up with is that when i bought the bike, i was putting gasoline with an octane rating of 87. Now i'm putting fuel with a higher octane rating, 91 or 93, i'm not sure which. Could this be the cause or could it be something else?

20090225153826AAyQOYE	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Is my auto start what is wrong with my car?	I have a 2003 Ford Explorer.  I had auto start installed in it about a month ago, I know its a Viper but I don't remember the rest of the details on what model.      Every once in a while when I start my car with the auto start  once I am in the car and start to try to drive away the car will try to stall and I have to stop and wait or it dies.      This morning before I left for work when my car was in the garage there was a blue light flashing on a senson attached to my windshield near my rear view mirror but I just assumed it had always done that and I had just never noticed.  When I drove to work this morning, the car drove fine.      Today at noon I hit my auto start button on the remote, and after 2 minutes the remote indicated to me it was shutting the car off.  When I went out to my car and tried to start it with the key, the car would turn over but wouldn't start.  It did the same thing with I attempted the autostarter again, and after a couple of minutes the autostart quit trying.      After several attempts I got the car started with a key but then when I shut it off and tried with the auto starter it didn't work.  It seems to be hit or miss, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. But when it doesn't it seems to incapacitate my car for up to half an hour.      What could be causing this?

20090225153621AAw8pkM	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;BMW	Why would anybody buy a BMW X6 when it gives none of the advantages of an SUV and costs $2,000 more than an M3?	I always thought it was pointless, but then I learned the price.  $56,000 for the twin turbo V6...      The point of this vehicle is to have a great driving SUV.  It is fun to drive, but it offers none of the advantages of an SUV.  Not much cargo room, cramped rear seats...      This car costs $2,000 more than the M3 sedan!  If you want a car that's great to drive and is only semi-practical, why would you buy the X6 over the M3 sedan!?!?!?!!      SERIOUSLY!??!?!?!?!  I saw two today, and it really pisses me off!!!!  lol.

20090128190512AApHj97	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Scion	Scion xB No-hassle price? Can you haggle or is the price what is on the sticker?	I am looking at getting the Scion xB 2009.  I am wondering about their No-Hassle pricing.  Does this really mean that you can't get them to come down on their price? Even by just a little bit ($500-1000)? What happens if the car trim and features is at another dealership? Will they transfer the car to my local dealer or will there be a mark-up for doing that? Or do I have to go there to get it?  I am wondering what incentives they have at the dealership as well for this car.  Any help would be great!!!      note: I know the 2006 and older had a cracked windshield issue.  I have contacted several people who have the 2008 and 2009 models and none of them have had a problem since Toyota "fixed" the framing and the window length and depth.
