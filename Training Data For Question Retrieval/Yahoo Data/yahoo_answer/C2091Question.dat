20090222161235AA5Grco	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	Questions to make you think....?	You meet a wizard in downtown Chicago.  The wizard tells you he can make you more attractive if you pay him money.  When you ask how this process works, the wizard points to a random person on the street.  You look at this random person.  The wizard says. “I will now make them a dollar more attractive.”  He waves his magic wand.  Ostensibly, this person does not change at all; as far as you can tell, nothing is different.  But – somehow- this person is suddenly a little more appealing.  The tangible difference is invisible to the naked eye, but you can’t deny that this person is vaguely sexier.  This wizard has a weird rule though – you can only pay him once.  You can’t keep paying giving him money until you’re satisfied.  You can only pay him one lump sum up front. How much cash do you give the wizard?       _&      You are sitting in an empty bar (in a town you’ve never before visited), drinking Bacardi with a soft-spoken acquaintance you barely know.  After an hour, a third individual walks into the tavern and sits by himself, and you ask your acquaintance who the new man is.  “Be careful of that guy,” you are told.  “He is a man with a past.”  A few minutes later, a fourth person enters the bar; he also sits alone.  You ask your acquaintance who this new individual is.  “Be careful of that guy too,” he says. “He is a man with no past.”  Which of these two people do you trust less?          lastly...      Your best friend is taking a nap on the floor of your living room.  Suddenly, you are faced with a bizarre existential problem: This friend is going to die unless you kick them (as hard as you can) in the rib cage.  If you don’t kick them while they slumber, they will never wake up.  However, you can never explain this to your friend; if you later inform them that you did this to save their life, they will also die from that.  So you have to kick a sleeping friend in the ribs, and you can’t tell them why.  Since you cannot tell your friend the truth, what excuse will you fabricate to explain this (seemingly inexplicable) attack?
