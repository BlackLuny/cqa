I have a new ipod nano and want to buy an fm transmitter that will work on both my home and (older, cd-playing) car stereo.  I don't want one that runs off of the ipod battery.  So...is there a model that will both plug into my car's power AND also plug into a wall socket at home?  Or, if I buy a car version with power adaptor, can I buy a separate home wall charger and plug them both in at the same time?  The nano only seems to have one place to plug in 'extras' (aside from the headphone socket) so I'm assuming one can't plug it into two things at once.  Suggestions??

20090202094749AAr3ktZ	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Would reading a camera's manuel before purchasing really help?	I just want to get a feel for certain cameras. I know going into a store and trying them helps, and I have used several of the cameras I am looking into, but in a point and shoot opportunity, not in the situation where I could really sit down and feel it out. I have tried the Canon rebel XT and Nikon D90.   I really want to make sure I am getting the right camera, and getting the most for my money, because SLRs are expensive and I'd like to make as little of mistakes as possible in this process.   So, when you personally are looking into getting a new camera, what do you look for, and how do you know it's the one?    Any help, information, and/or links are very greatly appreciated.    Also please know that I am diligently researching on my own also. I hate answering questions that can be easily answered by google, so I like to make sure I avoid it.    Thanks.
