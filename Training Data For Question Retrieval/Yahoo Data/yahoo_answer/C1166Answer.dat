I'm definitely against real fur though, I've seen enough videos of horrible animal abuse in the fur industry.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with everything PETA does or believes, but I do appreciate their attempts to get the message out about animal abuse.

There are a lot of spooky sinister things that go on behind the scenes when it comes to the fur industry.|`|FG248uVsaa	Atttractiveness is subjective. It depends what the individual thinks looks good.<br>  <br>  Real fur? Personally I don't think it's OK to wear a non-food animal's pelt unless you're an Inuit or live in a very cold country where fur is necessary for you to keep warm, and even then that is only if there's no alternative. For example, some native tribes use every part of an animal for food, tools, etc, so there's no reason why they shouldn't use the skin too. This is why leather and sheepskin, while technically fur (animal skin), are less of an issue than non-food animal skins, because otherwise the leather/sheepskin is going to waste. If people were exclusively vegan then all animal skin/hair etc would be surplus to purposes, but until that happens, I think it's perfectly valid to use by-products of an essential (ie, food) industry unless you have moral objections (and to be honest, noone's forcing you to wear dead animal - it's your call.)<br>  <br>  Faux fur? Hell yeah. If nothing's died for it, go for it.<br>  <br>  I've never worn "fur", but do wear leather shoes, jackets and belts. Sheepskin is also technically a fur, though I've never worn it. (I did lie on a sheepskin rug when I was about 16 weeks old though...)<br>  <br>  PETA (USA) and the RSPCA (UK, but I think there are branches worldwide) come to mind, and there are other organisations against cruelty to animals.|`|YXlIg3f5aa	i think fur is very unattractive.<br>  <br>  i think it's definitely NOT okay to wear real fur.<br>  <br>  faux fur, sure, if you like the fur look.<br>  <br>  i've never worn fur.<br>  <br>  yeah, peta2.org<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i think people should stop wearing real fur and eating innocent animals. it's not fair.|`|NAe0F1e0aa	Yes its completely ok.

AAjMQtzUaa	thanks for the answer on my question i am glad to answer yours, the cover up i would use is called kryolan derma colour camouflage system creme its dermatogically tested and it works very well, as i use it all the time and i have eczema and very sensitive skin also have used on a friend of mine that suffers very bad acne and it hasnt effected her skin at all, you can get this online from a place called www,performerszone-usa.com it is around $15 -$20 dollars but i tell you it is worth the money and it will last ages i mean you can use this everyday and it will last you at least 12 mth or even a little longer a little goes a long way with this stuff and it will cover up everything it even covers up tattoos as i have tried on mine. As for a foundation that wont cause acne i would go the Maybelline Mineral Power (natural perfecting foundation) if you are in the states you can get it for around $8 from walmart, target or kmart i use this as well and have had not a single problem with it at all and i have also used this on my friend that suffers from bad acne and it didnt have an effect on her neither so she uses this now, also just a suggestion airbrushing makeup on also is a great way as most of the airbrush makeup is dermo tested but airbrushing is a more expensive way to do your makeup but its is a flawless application and not like normal foundations and powders it doesnt clog the pores of the skin, its just a suggestion for you anyway , with your skin tone i would go for brown colour eyeshadows, and black,teal or brown eyeliners and lip gloss i would go a light brown or even a nice rose pink, just remember when you are doing the eyeshadow, use a darker brown on the bottom of your eye, then a lighther brown on the top and a little bit of  a charcoal colour on the side but blend in with fingers and then put the light over the top again this will bring out the eyes more and they will look bigger and give you an evening look, good luck with it all if you need any more advice please let me know, and i think you look maybe 16. and if you are in melbourne australia i will gladly give you a free makeover and advice if you like.|`|d6eb86ea1083363a2ee41e2529dc84a2aa	You are probably going to want to use mineral make-up. I would suggest Everyday Minerals because they give you free (or near free)<br>  samples and they are also very affordable. Do a search for them online.  Green toned concealer is good to cover red, something to consider. If you use mineral concealer( which is available in green), apply it wet, with a brush. Make sure you blend well. Then apply a concealer over it that is closer to your skin tone.Then buff the dry foundation on over it.<br>  <br>  Personally I think pastels are your color, but don't take my word for anything. Here is what I suggest you do:<br>  <br>  Go to  one of these websites:<br>  <br>  Covergirl.com<br>  getmakeovers.com<br>  beautyriot.com<br>  lifetime.com<br>  <br>  Cover Girl is the best cause you can find their make up anywhere. Then upload your photo to their "make-up mirror" and try on their colors!|`|bIpcVlBaaa	you looks beautiful!!!<br>  look dear dont harm yr skin with any cosmetics<br>  its obvious that yr skin sensitive so check yr food to see what increase the acne in yr skin.<br>  for myself my skin was just like yrs but I discovered that eating chocolate increase the acne in my skin when I stopped eating it,my skin started to recover,but in my period the acne return back to my skin and this last for a week,but in this case its out of my control........<br>  check what increase the acne in yr skin & stop doing it!!!!!!!.|`|AA12117293	I have found that NYX has amazing products, the twin cake pressed powder may be something you want to try.

Before applying any makeup, wash your face in warm water, regular unscented soap is fine, then apply an astringent like Witch Hazel to close the pores, this will keep the makeup out and help prevent breakouts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|QOsewJqWaa	okay so i use loreal infallible concealor and mineral powder instead of foundation its works great.<br>  <br>  its $10 but worth it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.echemist.co.uk/ProductMedia/536803143.Jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.echemist.co.uk/ProductMedia/5...</a><br>  <br>  clinque has great makeup that wont cause acne and they will show you want kinds to use and how for free and the stands at your local mall. but it is kind of expensive for their makeup.<br>  <br>  dont use too much eyeliner at any costs, it will cause your eyes to look squinty, i made that mistake for years.

SLInYvmGaa	Thin hair might be more manageable, but it can be so frustrating as well since you're so limited when it comes to styling!  I have super thin hair, and it is just so limp and boring.  I can't get it to look like most of the haircuts in any salon magazine, and trying to do anything than just a plain limp ponytail requires 4000 cans of hairspray and just ends up a nightmare.  If I try to curl it, my curls fall apart after half an hour and I just have stick-straight hair again.

If you're not to bothered about it simply get a pea sized amount of wax(preferably wax cos it looks natural) and spread it aroundyour palms. Then, RUFFLE up your hair and you're done. This is done simply to show the layers of your hair and add more volume to it and style.<br>  <br>  If you DO care about having 'stylish' hair though then you can grow it a bit longer and get your hair thinned. Ask the hairdresser they'll know what to do. Then simply get some wax making sure you start at the back first; go deep into the roots of your hair because this is what keep[s up your hair, secondly do the top of your hair by either ruffling it up and making it look messy or twisting it around for the 'spiky' 'jaggedy' look. then make the sides clean by twisting it etc.<br>  Optional to do the fringe but if you want just twist it.|`|JltE5LIHaa	Start off by going to the hairdresser for a really good cut then get a really good conditioner and use it each time you shampoo. Use an intensive shampoo once a week which you leave in for about 5-10 mins. When you blow dry it use a heat protective serum. Good on you for staying natural.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	You need to use specific shampoos and conditions for grey hair. Have a look in boots.

I came to college thinking oh god I need to go buy all new clothes, and I did.. I bought all the same things I wore in high school. Then I got to college and was like.. wow.. she looks cool.. whoa I would never think to wear those. Then everything I was too "shy" to wear in high school was perfect for college..

And by 4WD I dont mean your flashy fashion rubbish, I mean Land Rovers!<br>  If and I say IF with some reservations, if what you suggest ever happened to me then I'd engage the correct gear ratios and drive out properly.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	I<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Would <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Call<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mate<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Get<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Me <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Help<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Or<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Get<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Me<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Out<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  !!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Think <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  This<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Is<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Longest<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Answer<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hehe<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :P<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Xxxx|`|yDMaxiw9aa	Well first of all i'd try to avoid muddy bogs but if that was impossible then i'd sit in the car and laugh at my stupidity for a while then i'd ring my friends ad family to tell them what i have done. Then i'd sit and scream for a while to see if anyone will be willing to push the car out for me because i dont want to get dirty. If not then i suppose i'll ave to ring the tow truck lmao to get me out but they are nearly always busy and wont be available for another 3 hours or something stupid like that so i'd have to sit in the car for another while to syk myself up to get out of the car and get muddy. Then out i'd have to get and 1.. 2.. 3.. PUSH!! The car would probably roll out of the mudd after a   l  o   n  g while then i wouldnt realise it was moving and would most definately fall over face first into the mud and spend the rest of the way home laughing and my second dose of stupidity and wondering why my hair colour isnt blonde and that i must be blonde at heart. Then the next day i'd probably forget where the muddy bog was and drive into it again and will have to repeat the whole process again.<br>  <br>  The End!

6gJKJdC4aa	Depends on what you are planning to do... are you trying to put streaks in it? You could spritz some lemon juice on selected strands and sit out in the sun... or use peroxide... you say you don't want to bleach or dye it, but if you want to lighten your hair, you're gonna be bleaching it anyways, no matter what... peroxide is what hairdressers use in lighter toned dyes to lighten hair...|`|0I44bJjAaa	Hydrogen Peroxide

I'd consult plastic surgeons in your area and see what they have to offer. <a href="http://www.plasticcosmeticsurgerycenter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticcosmeticsurgerycenter....</a> A local cosmetic surgeon should be able to answer your questions.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Why?  If I want to pay my own money to do something with my own body then it has nothing to do with anyone else.|`|Moe5zGO7aa	I agree with plastic surgery. This reason why is because people aren't always happy with their bodies and can help boost self confience and self esteem. I don't believe in all procedures like labia reconstruction and toe shorten as examples. I also believe there should also be some sort of limit and people shouldnt go insane and get like 30 procedures to alt themselves way to much|`|Dk8AYLgKaa	okay, personally, there are two different kinds of cosmetic surgery: the unnecessary one and a correctional one<br>  i don't understand girls with perfect bodies and faces that want plastic surgery<br>  the surgeon should be able to say no to these girls<br>  <br>  on the other hand, I understand how some elderly woman would want a face-lift of some kind, or a woman that has had 4 children that wants a little belly-tuck<br>  doesn't every woman have the right to feel happy in their skin?<br>  but when it becomes compulsive, like having breast enlargement after breast enlargement (à la Pamela Anderson), that should be forbidden!|`|2inq4zHZaa	As another said, I think of it as a body mod, and people should be free to do with their bodies as they wish.  I see no harm in it.  I feel like it should be more focused on people who really need it though.  People with deformities, or that were in accidents.  At the same time, some people just feel like they need it to feel good about themselves, and I can't judge anyone who does that.  Everyone wants to have self-confidence, and many people achieve it through plastic surgery.  Sometimes I see perfectly normal people getting breast implants and think, "Wow, all that money could have gone to someone who really needed it"  and I think it's kinda sad.  But should definitely not be banned.  I say, "It's your body, it's your right"|`|XaYHMNusaa	No, b/c I believe it's a form of body modification and people shouldn't be dictated to on what they can and can't do to their bodies.|`|AA10236694	i think it should be banned on minors even with parental consent.once your of age its your body to do as you please but under 18 your still growing .
af0lmUtqaa	well if it doesnt have to be everything pink then really suggest a nice pair of jeans or cute denim shorts or white shorts, something that doesnt contract with pink, somehting that matches, like blach white denim and that. um nike airs go with EVERYTHING : ) especially cool : ) add some jewellery and your off. its just cas dress at school so dont be to fancy.
RlHW1G4Uaa	do it right after you have a shower so the skin is soft and the hairs come out easier. also use ice on the parts you're plucking so that they become numb, hence no pain!|`|v06bbtW6aa	the more frequent you pluck you eyebrows the less it hurts. so just put up with the pain if you want to look good. getting them waxed also hurts less than the plucking..but they still pluck when theyve finished but it is less plucking and hurts less.|`|AA11809403	placing a ice cube on the hairs for a few seconds can reduce the pain some.|`|oPi9GQk9aa	go get them waxed|`|PeNTl6KOaa	pluck them the way the hair grows.<br>  <br>  xx|`|3vwvLWrHaa	By shaving them off

Love curls. I can't even have a perm because muscle relaxers won't allow permanents to take. Enjoy your lovely hair.|`|w7tjaqh2aa	don't do it! chances are some chemical will overlap... i've done it 3 times and my hair splits like crazy... 2 splits, branched into 2 more splits etc etc... not a pretty site|`|RYs68lCvaa	don't do it! chances are some chemical will overlap..... something can happy !!!!!|`|vY0ScgeXaa	the fact well justified the ad. hmm if its permanent, why the hell you have to straighten it for the 4th time? it should be permanent straight after the 1st time trying.|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	You can't permanently straighten your hair.  Who ever told you you could was simply trying to make more money off of you.  The best chemical straigtener and conditioner is Mizani so find a salon that uses those products and ditch the stylist who told you you can staighten your hair forever, they are a liar or a complete idiot that has no idea about hair.
e81959782c59f9f811b7f1845377c429aa	no.regular waxing reduces the growth to a great extent.|`|32d808376cd2ba67d02e1e31adfd3d09aa	ask the experienced people!|`|2fHM4fIxaa	it does not and actually it  slows down the growth...|`|YNFuWGpwaa	Yes it does!|`|1dM04rNraa	yeah it does.. but it looks sexy!..|`|3y8Y8Qlfaa	Waxing does not make hair grow back thicker, it may look thicker but it actually grows back thinner. It does cause the hair to grow at a slower rate and will make your hair growth less after it is done for a long period of time, if done correctly.|`|oAGNmGfqaa	I think it actually eventually grows back less.|`|ySfHzOdgaa	No, it permanently reduces hair growth.|`|RWiom35vaa	no, it grows back weaker in fact. happy waxing!|`|CkVS9Oxzaa	no...not at all<br>  they remain still...can grow even thinner|`|sOCLwxnFaa	yeah but it doesnt grow back very quickly|`|rBpxxtH9aa	NO|`|qwXNl0n2aa	no i don't think so|`|bOQQR2pYaa	FFS NO.

xfAk2KaUaa	Best home remedy is lemon juice! Because it's acidic and is known to not only cleanse your skin (get rid of pimples, blackheads, etc.), melt away top layer of dead skin cells, it can fade freckles!<br>  Simply get some lemon juice and you can rub it straight into your skin, BUT if you have sensitive skin, dilute it with water or honey first. Leave on for 10-15 mins every day, and hopefully in a few weeks you will see a difference.<br>  <br>  But for now, stay out of the sun as much as possible as this will just give you more freckles, use sunscreen whenever possible.|`|xypkwlpBaa	you cant get freckels removed.<br>  i think the add character.so u should be proud of them.<br>  but bare minarles cover them up best.|`|W55tjTcbaa	there's no way to get rid of freckles.  stay out of the sun and they will fade but only time will tell.  they may stay forever or disapear!...freckles are so cute anyway!!|`|o83jqZwOaa	i love freckles...hot|`|T47eNWkOaa	sun tan lotion..use spf 60 or higher and reapply<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090310035119AAYgCd5">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|WttToNwtaa	freckles are beautiful :)<br>  leave them, but if you realllllly need to get rid of them try coverup or avoid sun contact for a couple days, they should fade.<br>  <br>  best of luck :)|`|6e2p7fjXaa	aww freckles can be cute! :)<br>  <br>  but concealer should do the trick. and ive heard theres laser removal, although thats a bit too drastic in my opinion|`|DTrqM46taa	I'm not sure if they disappear within time, but I guess stay away from the sun, or put sunblock lotion on

OEc9lp5paa	Try style.com<br>  <br>  I am a huge supporter of forums.vogue.com.au - Once you go Vogue you won't go back!<br>  <br>  When shopping online, do try to follow the trends but the most important thing is to make sure the clothes actually suit them. You can put someone in the most stylish piece of clothing but if it doesn't suit them they'll look terrible. <br>  <br>  For websites, try something like topshop.com as they do focus on interesting clothes. I'm assuming you are from Aus due to the mention of Jeans West (although I may be wrong). This way you'll always have something no one in your area will have. <br>  Also, if possible, try to venture into the city now and again to get some inspiration.<br>  <br>  :)|`|ixmaM395aa	Are you from Australia? Just thought you were because you mentioned Jeans West. <br>  <br>  Anyway, don't rule out Jeans West as being behind in fashion because come to the city and you'll find much the same style in all the other stores. Jeans West are currently selling two of the biggest trends (in Oz). The boho chic trend & the boyfriend trend (relaxed jeans, oversized cardigan). So if that's all you've got then shop up big at Jeans West as they're good quality clothing too. <br>  <br>  And Target are good for the essentials. Comfy t-shirts and cute accessories. So work with what you have. <br>  <br>  If you're after more info on fashion trends then start to buy a couple of fashion magazines. Vogue is great, you may not be able to afford all that is in the magazine, but for up to date, high end fashion then that will be your bible.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	why do you care? who are you gonna impress, a bunch of hicks that dont care one way or another?<br>  <br>  EDIT: cool. i'm a male and i know fashion? just because you're a girl doesnt mean you have to, and if you knew anything about fashion, then you wouldnt be asking us, now would you

From what i've seen, these girls are treated with respect and taken care of while they are on a shoot and they love what they do.

Is being admired physically that important to you?<br>  <br>  Too many girls use their bodies, to not much avail, as a means to an end and as an end in itself. But developing your talents and intellect will get you much further, and give you much more latitude in life, than a spread in Playboy.|`|6e2p7fjXaa	haha yeah..cuz all the guys who look at the pics are usually prolly quite dirty? if you want to pose nude, try posing for more arts photographs? :)|`|PnE35NZlaa	i agree with brooklyn|`|WVnrjYnvaa	For women who have class, it's bad.

AsnGFwafaa	- Get pumped! Get in some cardiovascular exercise for at least half an hour every day. Whether it be running, biking, rowing, dancing -- anything that gets your heart rate up is awesome.<br>  <br>  - Cut down on the starches and sweets. Loading on too many bad carbohydrates (white pasta, rice, bread) can make you feel heavy, and, consequently, look heavy. Likewise, too much sugar can make you feel hyper. Eat ice cream, cake, cookies, bread, pasta in moderation. Try whole grains instead.<br>  <br>  - Water! If you can't drink eight glasses, start off with four a day. Then steadily increase. <br>  <br>  - Create a workout journal. Jog down your results on paper. Not only do you feel good, that also makes your achievements look good.<br>  <br>  I would also check out <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page</a><br>  It has a lot of useful articles.|`|7lQylFnyaa	Cool youve got a really good attitude and energy so im sure you will achieve your goals no problem!<br>  <br>  To help you out you need to be doing tonnes of exercise.

rjac15O0aa	Yeah you will have to stick grey.  Or you can do grey with white highlights.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I have never known a shop to offer metallic inks. But your options are obviously to hunt around in the hope of finding somewhere, or give up on the idea. No vaguely professional shop is going to tattoo you with a bottle of ink you've brought in off Ebay. Bug Boi is correct - you know a decent artist can easily create a silver, metallic appearance with grey and white tones, and probably more 3D looking this way than with one flat shade of silver. And this way you aren't risking intoxicating yourself - I love tattoos a huge amount but I think it's plain stupid to risk your health for one, that's a very precious thing.|`|4vqzkIr4aa	There are silver inks available from most of the big name brands. NO INKS ARE MADE FROM METALLIC PIGMENTS. Yes, some are made from zinc or iron based pigments. But I presume you are speaking of like a metallic paint job.<br>  <br>  Most any artist when doing a metallic piece will use several different colors to create the metallic look and most likely none are gray or silver. When you look at a metallic object it is almost like a mirror reflecting all the colors around it. A metallic look is created by stratigic placement of surrounding colors and proper highlights. Not by silver or chrome ink. Most of the time this silver color is created by mixing a purple, a brown, a gray and a white (not going to list exact hues of these colors - some things we keep sacred). But this mix is created for the base color of the metal surface and only used sparingly around the highlight areas.<br>  <br>  But any good artist has done his share of metallic looking pieces and can make just about any color or surface look metallic. It is not a very difficult task for a skilled artist.|`|9HQVrydZaa	It is obvious that you would go to another tattoo shop or you could try buying mettalic tattoo ink from ebay and take it into your tattoo shop and ask the tattooist if he would use it on your tattoo. hope this helps.|`|AA11451457	Go to another shop? or ask them why they dont do it. If its a health issue then you may want to rethink your design and have the silver done in light grey (or similar) instead<br>  <br>  Good luck :) xx|`|N2XKAzZQaa	if it can be toxic then i doubt any tattoo shop will do it for you<br>  you'll have to change yout tattoo idea<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  :)
0rPxUIpAaa	I got my first tattoo right above my bum. Its a large heart with my 3 sons names. It only hurt in some small spots. People made it out to be so much worse than it was. The first few seconds is the worst then your body kicks up the adrenaline and the pain dulls. Im not saying you wont feel it! Just talk to your artist or friend while its being done and keep your mind busy. Hold still! And start thinking about your next cause you never stop at one lol!|`|yQFHoEqxaa	Well, I have one on my right hip area, and it hurt REALLY bad. I love my tattoo, but I will never get another one again because I personally thought it hurt A LOT. However, everyone else is correct, it also depends on your pain threshold and where you get it done.<br>  <br>  Also: make sure you follow the tattoo artist's instructions for after-care. If you don't you could get scabs and it will ruin your tattoo. I have seen that happen.|`|3uBwwFE0aa	of course it hurts. everyone has a different level of pain that they can handle but it does hurt. when i had all of mine done i handled it pretty well. i let the guy get on with it so it was over quicker but it still felt like a hot knife. the outline of the tattoo hurts but the colouring in doesn't. <br>  <br>  my ex bf and other people i know almost passed out and had to have sugary drinks to help them feel better when they had theirs done. <br>  <br>  where you have it on your body will make a difference. but make no mistake, there will be some level of pain, but hopefully manageable|`|P2zbIXztaa	not really pain its just really uncomfortable if it hurt that much ppl wouldnt get more than 1|`|55c6bcdec944656754c033c36667ba6baa	I got my first one on my lower back and it hurt soo bad, a lot more then I thought it would|`|U2tx9gDHaa	Yes it does.|`|9HQVrydZaa	depends on your pain tolerance.|`|JEteneuUaa	My friend. <br>  <br>  Tattoo wont hurt if you really want it now will it. <br>  <br>  Well thats the way I thought about it.

Yesterday I gor one on my ear and it didn't hurt at all.<br>  <br>  Generally where the skin is close to the bone (wrist, ankle, collarbone, etc) it's more painful, and stomach's meant to hurt a bit too, but it's far from unbearable.|`|ec75e725937fc92000f2745410651420aa	All tattoo's hurt, but the level of pain depends on on were you get it done.

It does depend on how well you can take pain, and how big the tattoo is and where it's at. But if you have an average pain tolerance, like I do, it won't hurt all that bad. I got my tattoo on my shoulder blade. It stung, but didn't feel that bad. Now I'm thinking about what I want for my 2nd tattoo...HAHA.<br>  <br>  You just have to relax and tell yourself that the pain won't last forever. It'll be a little tender when it's done, but you'll have the tattoo to admire for the rest of your life.|`|qcWdop9uaa	really depends where on ur body u have it done and what ur own pain threshold is...i myself have 5 tats,and each one felt like a different experience at the time.

But it may be best to get it done professionally.  You would also need to go back every couple of months because when the hair starts to grow out you will need to have the hair palm-rolled so the roots will start to locks too. Once it is done small and neat it will look nice and there are a lot of hair styles that you can do with locks. And if you get bored and want them off just let the hair grow and not palm-roll the roots until you think your hair is long enough and just cut off the locks.|`|QwdQQSzAaa	i would go to a perfosinal and did you know the only way to get rid of them is to cut them all out so i will have to get really shout hair if you dont like them any more|`|3ckc7waBaa	you dont just grow them!<br>  dont wash your hair or brush it for ages.<br>  or you could do them the clean way.. <br>  <br>  twist it up and then matt it all up by back combing it with a brush. <br>  or comb. <br>  but either prob takes a while...<br>  <br>  <br>  but whhy would you want them ?|`|luTfdMETaa	grow? you make them,i dunno how though(would ask hairdresser lol) but my mate has fake 1s,its like a hair band,looks really cool and very real though. x|`|x6vgZmTXaa	It would take a lot of work and be really gross BUT thankfully there are several videos on youtube that show you how to make synthetic dreads and you can either keep them temporary or sow then into your hair like a weave.|`|ySfHzOdgaa	Get a professional to do it, it looks a lot better.|`|pf2QP0BNaa	dont wash it for ages, and then twist with a little bee's wax

A coat of face powder should do the trick, and I recommend that you do not use foundation underneath as it usually contains an oil that makes eyeshadow crease.  A primer is best.<br>  Next, apply the liner of your choice generously making sure to go into the lash line and blending it out on the lid (both top and bottom)<br>  Apply a medium tone eye shadow starting at the lashes and blending up to the brow bone.<br>  Use a darker toned eye shadow as a soft diffused line all around the eyes.<br>  Also, apply to the inside and outside corners of the eyes to add definition.<br>  Apply a luminescent eye shadow in the center of the lids and the inside corner of your eyes.

I know it sounds weird, but it won't turn your skin green, I promise. The green counteracts the red tones in your skin and gives you a more natural colored finish. Try Loreal mineral powder foundation over the top as it has good coverage, minerals that feeds goodness into your skin and a kabuki brush applicator that exfoliates your skin as you apply it which could help lessen the red patchy appearance.
adyNCp6eaa	Try using this old shampoo called Prell. It totally strips your hair of all of its oils and greasyness. It works wonders for people with really greasy hair.

mp5Vg7Peaa	I have blue eyes and I do this look all the time.<br>  <br>  [1]Sweep the beige colour across the lid, starting with the inner corner<br>   <br>  [2]blend a medium-dark brown into the outer corner of the socket.<br>  <br>  [3]sweep a lil of the beige into the brown to help with the blending<br>  <br>  And voilà :)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	yes it will work check out youtube.com for smokey eyes|`|s8Wwk7H7aa	Yes! Browns, bronzes and golds make blue eyes pop. Try the Revlon Colorstay Quad in Coffee Bean.  Use the top three colors for daytime for a neutral look.  For a more smoky look, apply the darkest shade on lids, starting at the lashline and blending toward the crease.  Use an eyeliner brush (or the pointy sponge that comes with the quad) to line all around eyes with the dark color.  Use finger or qtip to smudge and blend for a nice "smokiness".  Use the lightest color, or a shimmery highlighter, under brows to highlight.  If you want more dramatic definition, line the inner rims of your upper and lower lashes with black or dark brown waterproof pencil.  Top with volumizing black mascara.  voila.|`|axRmUSCJaa	What I do is...<br>  <br>        I first apply a brown eyeliner on the top lash line, and then take a eyeliner brush or very small brush, wet is slighty, and dip it in the brown shadow.  The just kinda smudge that over the liner.  Using the same shadow (or a lighter shade if you prefer) fill in your lid crease with an eyeshadow brush and blend it down into the lower lid.  For the lower lash line, just use the smudging technique with the eyeshadow on the small damp brush.  Don't use eyeliner on your lower lash line, as it can weight your eyes down and make the makeup look less natural.  Finish with a couple coats of mascara on top and a light layer of mascara on the outer-bottom lashes. :)  Hope that helps, let me know how it works for ya!|`|NJzye6kJaa	Which quad did you get? I was a Revlon makeup artist for ages. Go to the Revlon site --<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.revlon.com.au/default.taf?pg=43&type=4&category=50" rel="nofollow">http://www.revlon.com.au/default.taf?pg=...</a> <br>  <br>  It has a basic "how to". If you want a smoky look, try to create a "triangle" on the outer corner of your eyelid with the darkest colour. Blend, blend, blend. Then apply a dark brown eyeliner over the top. Try to use a crayon style one rather than a liquid so that you can smudge it. Take it all the way along the top lid and 1/3 of the way along the bottom lashes, starting from the outer corner. Apply lots of mascara over the top and you're done!|`|XiChBHl1aa	Yes, browns and golds go well with blue eyes. :)<br>  You could try applying a medium brown all over the lower lid, and then a darker one in the outer corners and a lighter one in the inner corners, then blend well! blending is the key to smokey looks. <br>  :) good luck!

It won't look good and your body may not be able to handle the implants. If it can't handle it, the skin stretching will cause stretch marks and you may bottom out and need more surgery. Go between 1-2 cup sizes larger. Possibly 3 if you've got a lot of extra skin from something like weight loss or pregnancy. Any more than that it has more complications and your breasts may end up on your collarbone and the skin will feel very tight.

fAaLjlI0aa	Well, it's chilled, not frozen tea bags that work on puffy, not dark eyes. The tannins in the tea reduce swelling, which reduces the puffy appearance, and it also soothes the eyes. You can also use tea bags for minor burns, sore nipples from nursing, stop bleeding gums (after tooth loss), and more. Tea does good inside and out!|`|afkygHMgaa	LOL...not frozen.....cold steeped tea bags. There is "tanin" in the tea which draws out the puffiness but not dark circles. However, it may decrease darkness created by the shadows from puffiness|`|SiomJ10Saa	I believe they more so take away the puffiness .. you can use a spoon stuck in the freezer as well to remove the puffiness, in the cool that reduces the swelling . . i wouldn't feel the tea bags though, just get them cold<br>  <br>  I guess there is something in the tea, not sure if it's the caffeine or antioxidants in it  .. that's supposed to help (more so than just a cooled object)|`|xktBgoKFaa	They don't work.

K0LbkHZuaa	Mary Jane was a character created by Richard Outcault for his comic strip, Buster Brown, which was first published in 1902. She was the sister of the title character, Buster Brown.<br>  <br>  In 1904, Outcault travelled to the St. Louis World's Fair and sold licenses to up to 200 companies to use the Buster Brown characters to advertise their products. Among them was the Brown Shoe Company, who later hired actors to tour the country, performing as the Buster Brown characters in theaters and stores. This strategy helped the Brown Shoe Company become the most prominently associated brand with the Buster Brown characters. The style of shoe Buster Brown's sister wore came to be known by her name, Mary Jane.|`|7vTRVOZQaa	Mary Jane invented shoes in the winter of 1916 on the Somme because all the soldiers toes were falling off.|`|8722fd3dd81caab576ff98023c172d15aa	yeah but who is mary jane lol.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Because Mary Jane wears them|`|b378fc3361a04779c15bf427c58b87afaa	Mary Jane is a nick name for marijuana..

This help circulate blood flow to the scalp with stimulate your roots.<br>  <br>  Also, for conditioning, stay upside down, however do not use the conditioner on your roots, just massage it into your ends.<br>  <br>  Some great products would be Phyto products which come in serums and pills (Phytophanere or Bioten dietary supplement). Sephora sells great Phyto products.<br>  <br>  Also, keratine shampoo and conditioners are great because the hair and nails are made of keratin.|`|ovkS3dW3aa	There are lots of natural foods that help your hair growth. Truth is, its very hard to eat EVERYTHING you need daily like veggies and fruits and extracts that help your hair grow faster. SO, the most effective thing for me has been an awesome complex for hair, nails and skin. Its from Nutrilite. Its like the most awesome products ever!!! Not only has it helped my hair, my nails are beautiful and it has even helped my skin have a natural glow. Hope this helps!|`|zlXofrG4aa	Nothing makes hair grow faster.  Your hair has grown at the same rate it always has and will continue to do so until you die.  You can only make it healthier and to do that you can take biotin or prenatal pills.  Massaging your head helps blood flow and can make your regrowth healthier as well.  No products, pills, or miracle anything will make your hair grow faster though.|`|x5NzYL8Taa	Massage your head for like 10 minutes thats ment to help. Also when you finished washing your hair pour cold water over your head :)

AA11271819	No, why should it?<br>  <br>  It's not as if they're cutting / digging ur hand, they're applying gel / acrylic on ur nails...<br>  <br>  isit ur 1st time geting them done or sumfin?<br>  <br>  X|`|lc2WYfeTaa	No, they shouldn't!! But some places people can be rough..I've had someone make me bleed before obviously I don't go there anymore!!! But if your going to get artificial nail get the gel nails they are much better!!|`|WGFtXo6Paa	No, not at all. Afterwards, if you rip them off accidentally, that will hurt a lot.|`|B2F4B1CBaa	Not even a bit. Unless they are cutting of your cuticles. Which is not a problem to all. They did it to my friend and her cuticles started bleeding. bad nail spa.. anyways u'll be fine.|`|SbZG9iPfaa	Not at all.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, when they are buffing your nails they will hit the skin a little bit and it might scare you a little bit but it doesnt hurt.|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	they dont hurt when theyre getting done<br>  if u hit them on something or accidentally rip one of then be prepared for some pain.|`|CKCtfqpBaa	nooooo it doesn't hurt at all! only when they're buffing your nails and they hit your skin....but when you rip one off it does but if you let them come off slowly then they won't hurt. :)
RdeoVdlIaa	use salt as a facial scrub, but don't scrub too hard, you may irritate your skin. a good way to get rid of blackheads is honey. it tried it once and it worked. you leave the honey on for about 10 minutes. when i lightly pressd down on a blackhead it came out. try it!|`|532XA7lkaa	Well, I wouldn't recommend smearing it all over your face...because peroxide can discolor skin...but toothpaste is a great home remedy.  It sounds like you need a new skin care regime all together.  Have you considered ProActive?  It's affordable on Ebay...under $20...maybe that will help.  I use toothpaste if I get one big one before bed or something, I just dab a little on and it crusts over and reduces the swelling for the next day....then just washes off with your normal face wash.  I use Clean and Clear, it's got a purple pump and it's bright orange in color.  It's for oily skin and works great for me....$4 a bottle too.  Good luck!  Sometimes it's just hormones.|`|V1QpnziHaa	i don't have an acne problem but have you tried seeing a dermatologist?<br>  also i notice that if my skin is becoming uneven, i go tanning. it dries my skin and gets rid of extra oil that cause zits. never sleep with makeup and wash your face 2 times a day.  <br>  <br>  i don't know if this will help but its worth a try.|`|U6rPVKhPaa	Bless u sound so clueless, like i used to be 2 b honest. <br>  <br>  I bet ur making many mistakes like i used to. I know have crystal clear, smooth skin...u want tha 2? follow these steps...<br>  <br>  Dont use soap to wash ur face! why people do this i will never know.<br>  I creates so much grease. Whenever u wash ur face, always use wet wipes, i use johnsons baby (blue n pink pack) they are cheap, smell nice, deep cleanse and dont cause nasty zits!<br>  <br>  Secondly, always take make-up off b4 bed, this is a must!<br>  Also if you wear foundation, u need to put a top coat over it 2 stop it getting greasy throughout the day. A top coat such as compressed powder. I recommend collection 2000 comressed powder, its only ￡2.00. Pik the right shade 4 u and ther is nuffin else 2 it.<br>  <br>  Finally get an exfoliating face scrub, from anywhere such as boots/superdrug. Basically its cream with little black bits in it! The best thing since sliced bread, rub that all over your face, real hard, ye it will kinda hurt, but its worth it! Trust me! After rubbing it in, leave for 5, thn swill with COLD water. Do that every night after removing make-up.<br>  <br>  Follow these 3 steps and trust me, u WILL get a nice clear face<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|8OOF3141aa	first drink tons of water and eat healthy. then scrub your face with sugar, or some baking powder mixed with water to make a mask, then just wash off. you should buy a face cleanser those work good like clean and clear or clearisel blackhead scrub works good.|`|VtJcCUvMaa	wash your face A LOT- and never touch it. wash three times a day- but not always with face wash- wash midday with water just to clear away oils
rxKvdkFyaa	Some do because it clogs your pores. My mom says it results in more acne because you don't give your acne time to breathe. So try not to use foundation. Tons of teens and such have acne and have to deal with it. In my opinion, I think putting make up to cover acne kinda draws more attention to it. So yes, it probably is true and if you do want to cover it up, use a good quality product that wont further more your acne. (:|`|KH9HROrSaa	it depends on what your using and how your skin will react, overall foundations have developed enough that they won't break you out. stick to brand with minerals in them and that are talc free.|`|p3GZERIsaa	Depends, the better the brand the better Mine doesn't so i'm sure you'll be fine :] As long as you wash it all off at the end of the day!|`|AGXk7TTWaa	I don't know for sure, but it probably would. and putting on too much foundation is nasty. Unless it's like one huge problem zit that you have to cover up, just leave the acne be and let it clear up on its own. everyone gets pimples so its not a really big deal. =)|`|x8Io7ENXaa	my foundation, <br>  maybelline pure liquid mineral, is good because i have some acne, and it hasnt made me get anymore and it covers it up quite nicely aswell :)|`|q90ozSQ9aa	Some can, mine doesnt..|`|QeALCWbqaa	no|`|CKCtfqpBaa	well for me no...but it depends on your skin type and the type of foundation you use....try oil free and talc free. and you should try washing your face with this oil-free nuetragena face wash that clears up acne...and try not to use too much foundation on the acne becasue this could just irrate it. use a moisterizer before you apply foundation and alwasy wash your face before going to bed and apply more moisterizer so your skin won't be dry...try clean and clear oil-free morning glow moisterizer.|`|kNJBwpgNaa	Try an oil free foundation.<br>  Also, take off your makeup with toner or makeup remover every night BEFORE you use soap on your face!! The soap mixing with your makeup will just rub that oil into your face. Then, in the mornings, use the toner on your face (with cotton ball) to remove dead skin cells. Dead skin cell buildup can cause acne like you wouldn't believe. I have had breakouts, and they only come back when I stop doing this!|`|RWYMy7jOaa	yeh, acne needs air to clear, if you want to get rid of it you can go to the chemist and ask. I got a really good cream, and pills to get rid of mine. <br>  <br>  (:|`|CdYvOnZqaa	well it will but if u get oil free it will help a little but it will cause acne b/c of the oils.. they put to much oil with it and it mixes up with the oils u have in ur body then in creates acne|`|cpfcRw0Oaa	yes and no. some foundations can. <br>  make sure ur face is cleaned well before applying <br>  and whatever u use to apply it with has to be clean as well.|`|u1AMsbdkaa	yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!

lU8e0VQFaa	Try an aspirin mask, I've heard very good things about that. Also, while it may be tempting, always wear a strong sun block, sun light can temporarily help acne but will make it worse in the long run (tanning thickens the skin and will make break outs worse in the future). For those big nasty ones that won't go away, try some neosproin and a band aid over night, this usually helps me the most. <br>  <br>  Just don't fret about it too much, stress makes acne worse, so try to relax and do the few things I suggested and it should be getting better.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	Don't eat any oily foods like crisps. Soft drinks can also cause acne.|`|h4hSJzdcaa	you could also use eye drops or tea tree oil|`|H6rPxpHWaa	How TO Get Rid Of Acne Fast:<br>  <br>  1) Green tea is, by far, the most superb herbal remedy for acne ever to be discovered.<br>  <br>  2) Lavender oil that is used for acne. <br>  <br>  3) Strawberries/Strawberry Leaves - Used in a poultice are recommended as an herbal remedy for acne. <br>  <br>  4) Lemon juice is a citric acid which is a part of AHAs group which is an effective home remedy for reducing the acne scars. <br>  <br>  People who suffer from acne are desperate to get rid of this affliction. Consultations for acne are more frequent than for any other skin disease, so it's no wonder products promising to fight acne is big business. <br>  So the real root causes of adult acne are something deeper than just bacteria. Those who suffer from acne are all of different ages, different backgrounds and different lifestyles. Mild outbreaks of acne are best kept clean, treated and then left alone. Drink lots of water throughout the day to flush the toxins out of your body which might help to lighten your condition.
wlEtGs0Maa	The neutrogena thing does work, but you have to use it faithfully to see results for fine lines etc. but either way it's nice for exfoliating.

I have it on my hip, a place visible if I'm in a swimsuit or crop top, but not in a wedding gown or suit.  Although Pitt's arm tattoo looked pretty cool in Oceans Eleven.<br>  <br>  I think the look of way-too-many of tattoos lacks class, especially on women.  If a tattoo'ed-up woman were to wear a wedding gown, with her arms and legs covered in ink, it would kinda ruin the effect of the gown.<br>  <br>  Tattoos hold a connotation in our society as being "badass".  It's hard for a girl to pull off ladylike class and "badass" at the same time.<br>  <br>  There are exceptions to every rule.  L.A. Ink's Kat Von D is exponentially more classy than Paris Hilton, for instance.|`|YIAZmSW7aa	I love tattoos.

I think they have more of a problem with them on women than on men - I don't think a tattoo on a man would even be something they'd notice. <br>  I find it interesting people think tattoos are a fad because that's one heck of a long fad and as to the professional thing, I've known plenty of people who are college grads and have high paying jobs who have tattoos.

2YzZ7DWoaa	Natural:<br>  <br>  Browns are great for eyeshadow and eyeliner. They look natural but define blue eyes magnificently!<br>  <br>  Fair, light pinks are great for fairer blondes.

This is great for blush and a sheer pink lip gloss is perfect, too<br>  <br>  Dramatic:<br>  <br>  Thin black liquid liner is an easy way to play up blue eyes and look great at the same time! Thick liner is cool too, but keep your lips nude if the eyes are the focal point. Too many focal points and you'll end up looking like a hooker! ;-)<br>  <br>  Red lips are great and totally bombshell- especially on fair blondes! (think Gwen Stefani or Marilyn Monroe)- but again, pair this with less dramatic eyes. If the eyes are more dramatic, but not totally out there, try a berry color on the lips.

tHdkwK2Daa	You can definitely put it on any blemishes - whiteheads, pimples, anything!!  It works very well because its an antibacterial oil.

Im sure they all work great!<br>  (If that link didnt work just go to lancome.com and go to foundations)|`|swxiulwtaa	I use Bare Minerals foundation and use it with That Gal Face Primer from Benefit<br>  my concealer is Boi-ing from Benefit. I like them both a lot<br>  Btw whats with your screenname? Are you trying to brag you can buy expensive clothes or something?|`|kT72QtHPaa	Revlon Colorstay!<br>  <br>  Use a stippling brush,and if you do you dont need much product! But blend it quickly because it adheres rather fast.<br>  <br>  It's full coverage.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take it off with a really good face wash or a cleanser and scrub,because its long lasting heavy duty foundation.If you don't you'll probably break out from the left-over foundation on your skin.<br>  <br>  But it's awesome!!|`|4M7ELAp4aa	i really like maybelline mineral power. its really nice and evens out my skin tone perfectly. It is made from 100% minerals and is a very good foundation. Also it doesnt look like you are waring founation, more like you just have very nice skin, :)
B2F4B1CBaa	It actually depends on who your getting it done from. Some ladies do it soft and just pull hair out from the top.. those last for like 3-4 days. other ladies pull hair from the root and those last for 6-7 days .. so you can say a week. And it really depends on the growth of your hair. you can always keep a tweezer on you for touch ups.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	When I had it done the first time it lasted 6 weeks and then has grown in thinner so lasts about 7-8 weeks before I "notice" and get it done again.|`|4l2qOy7Paa	less than a min for each eyebrow. it really depends how your eyebrows are.=]
FIOOKpz0aa	Once you establish a base tan then its more likely...once every week would be more efficent though. Especially depending on the beds, I went to one salon I went everyday for two weeks and had slight color a different salon I went everyday for a week and had a dramatic change in color. If you don't have a tan to maintain to begin with that would not work.|`|ofz43OY4aa	seriously you need to look after your skin sunbeds wouldn't help your problem, it would make it worse, you need to try a really good fake tan, there are thousands of products out there if you took the time to look i'm sure you would find one that would not make your skin problems worse, and even possibly one that could make it better!<br>  i'd also look up the effects of skin damage due to over use of sunbeds, once every two weeks will make you seriously baked, and when your hair is falling out because of all the treatment you'll be getting i think the eczema will be the last of your worries!|`|SiiMRyYQaa	Don't use a sunbed! Get a spray tan.<br>  <br>  Using a sunbed carried many risks, the main one being cancer. To be tanned you don't have to risk cancer so go get a spray tan.|`|2iB5erd9aa	go watch the documentary of claire oliver|`|KhRFf1L1aa	No, I don't think it would make you permanently tanned, but it will give you a tan.<br>  Even though you said you don't care about the risks, sunbeds can damage your skin really bad, making it worser than it was before!<br>  Fake tan is probabally cheaper, and might not irritate your exma :)|`|oRPvkExwaa	Tanning beds do help a lot with skin problems, and you will probably be tan all year long if you go this route, if you only go for a few minutes each time, maybe it won't be so drastic though. It also depends on how well you tan.|`|5318c2d46c71911df8843e0c385cf271aa	I dunno. But I got sunburned crazy bad three years ago and I still have tan lines. It wouldn't surprise me if something like that happened gradually to you. But tanning beds are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... bad for you!|`|Au0HK3O6aa	Possibly but you would be putting yourself at great risk of skin cancer.   Light treatment can help skin problems but only if used under clinical conditions.  Go consult a dermatologist and get professional advice for your skin.
4XKCa47haa	LIME GREEN, NEON ORANGE, OR BRIGHT YELLOW. OR BRIGHT BLUE WORKS TOO.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Warm colors.<br>  <br>  Pinks, corals, peachy nuetrals.<br>  <br>  Or bright colors.<br>  <br>  Bright blue, teal, yellow, white.<br>  <br>  Blue is a great color that is now 'in'. It contrasts against tan skin, and looks gorgeous. You could go for yellow that would go with the sunny vibe.<br>  <br>  Also gold would go great.|`|bIugOadQaa	maybe a a shiny hot pink, bright baby blue, shimmery light purple, color changing green (so it looks like blue in the dark). oh and maybe a glittery gold or bluish chrome.
PQx5Hniraa	try telling her how much it means to u or that it makes u feel more comfortable about yourself.. try 2 make her c it frm your point of view and tell her 2 try and picture her in your place/situation.. it worked with my mom.. try to ask her 2 at least let u wear eyeliner and lipgloss and with time u can build on from there =]|`|afh2poksaa	Personally I think you are a little young for makeup, but whatever.  Makeup is fun to play around with so I guess I can understand where you are coming from.  Sit down with your mom and talk about her concerns, is there a particular reason she doesn't want you to wear makeup?  It could be that she doesn't want guys to get the wrong message about you, etc.  Once you know her reasoning it may be easier to convince her otherwise.  See if you can compromise on a minimal makeup look to wear everyday and then on special occasions have the opportunity to add more colour, drama, etc.  For example, for someone your age you probably don't need to be wearing foundation, etc.  I think mascara and lipgloss is a nice day look for someone younger.  Then for parties maybe talk about adding some colourful eyeshadow or some eyeliner and a more dramatic lip colour.  Basically what you need to do is act like an adult about the situation and I'm sure you will be able to work something out.|`|4bDPhnCKaa	i go with ur mom makeup bustes ur face and u don't want to be ugly|`|AA11212023	Rationalize with her. <br>  Promise you won't go overboard with tons of eyeliner and mascara and lipgloss and blush all over. <br>  Say you'll wear mascara, concealer, and CLEAR lipgloss maybe, twice or three times a week. Print out pictures from the internet of people wearing nice, soft makeup that accentuates rather than covers up. <br>  Maybe she thinks you're pretty enough without it, so let her know that whatever you wear won't make you look horrible. If she thinks it'll ruin your skin, find makeup that is sensitive to your skin type. If it's too expensive..it's not. You can find clear lipgloss and mascara for under $10, I swear. <br>  Swear you won't abuse whatever power she gives you. If she completely disagrees and won't listen to you, then maybe talk to your dad/grandmother/someone else. <br>  <br>  As for the boyfriend, you don't have to tell your mom you have one. I don't think you even need one at that age, just focus on school. But if you find it necessary to get involved with someone, simply don't tell her. Ask a question about convincing her of that in another section where they can help you.|`|lLRBc2kzaa	my mum didnt let me wear it either<br>  when i wore a little and she saw she grabbed me by the hair and took me to the sink and turned the tap on and slapped water in my face<br>  i was 15 near 16<br>  what i did was at xmas bought really good stuff myself and said my friend bought it and she let me wear it so it didnt go to waste<br>  you should do that at your bday or xmas

When our bodies starts to change, our roughly 3 million sweat glands become more active. This is especially true for glands in the armpits and groin and on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. When the sweat comes in contact with bacteria on the skin, it can produce an odor, which may be stronger in some people than others.<br>  <br>  hope i helpedd|`|8aH0Ul1taa	Honestly I have the same problem as you.Do not use any of those secret,dove,ban,or degree.The best deodorant is totally Certain Dri by far.It works amazing.|`|UYzzlHzoaa	look for a deodorant that has aluminium chlorohydrate and every few hours or so, apply talc powder.<br>  <br>  i recommend dove deodorant.<br>  <br>  :]|`|GPMHV4C9aa	well i dont know anyone in the world who sweats like that! just stay home no one wants to smell that !!! or just see your doctor and get a persription.|`|Ne9fbdLdaa	Use Ban.<br>  I swear it helps(:

MRekIzQSaa	If you can stand waxing, I'd recommend you do that. It's a lot less painful, you don't get red bumps, it lasts three times longer than shaving, and your hair will gradually get thinner.<br>  But, if you're like me and can't stand the thought of ripping out your hair with sticky strips of paper.. You'll just have to bear through the shaving.<br>  When you first start shaving down there, it does hurt and gets really red and bumpy and you'll get a lot of ingrown hairs, but it gets better as that area gets "used" to the idea of going bald.<br>  First, "exfoliate" the area with some soap on a loofah. Then, always start by shaving WITH the growth of the hair (downward). THEN go upward. For the first couple times, do not shave every day, but wait for it to grow a little longer, then gradually start shaving it when it's shorter and shorter until you are comfortable with an every day routine.<br>  Also.. this is the MOST important.. ALWAYS start with a fresh, brand new/barely used razor blade. Save the dull blades for your pits and legs.<br>  Exfoliate again after shaving, and get some WItch Hazel and apply it after to help with any ingrown hairs.|`|5K0eYC35aa	eww i know its all spiky and it hurts a lil andits hard to shave idk about waxing it i wouldnt it willl hurt b a d l y|`|qRDbYqWFaa	I'm assuming you're using a shavers with blades, and no wonder it hurts, jeez... Check out local stores like walmart for an electric shaver (one like a man would use for their hair) a straight edge obviously, not a fancy circular one....  You can shave as often as you need to, no stubble and no cuts.

They probably put your head under a dryer for a while, too, I bet, huh?  That's when you really know they have no clue.<br>  Your hair is really, really damaged now, as I'm sure you know.  So don't do anything to it yourself, but don't go back to the same salon.  Go to a highly recommended popular salon in a suburb or city (no small town salons!).  Spend a good $100 or more, and they will use products to fix your hair condition, color, everything.

hRTUPGhoaa	well for starters you've got really pretty green eyes and gorgeous long lashes. so you've got a something great to work with.<br>  <br>  start by curling your lashes with a good quality eyelash curler<br>  <br>  apply a good, even coat of brown/black mascara (black will look too harsh) on both your top and bottom lashes<br>  <br>  get some pearl eyeshadow (the lighter the better but light neutral tones will work too)<br>  <br>  dust it lightly under your bottom lash line to brighten up the skin beneath your bottom lashes<br>  <br>  dust it on your lid and most importantly on the inner corners of your eyes (this is what will make them pop above anything else)<br>  <br>  now apply one last coat of mascara on the top and bottom lashes<br>  <br>  your look is finished!<br>  <br>  here's the end result:<br>  <a href="http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f313/a3kautzky/blah/xmas.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i50.photobucket.com/albums/f313/a...</a><br>  <br>  it takes some practice but you'll get the hang of it and your eyes will be the attention grabbers you want them to be|`|jWmnSXlLaa	You have great eyes and lashes already. Use some bolder colors for your lids. Search on yutube for some great ideas.|`|7355ad702ae490769df9563b4fb4bed6aa	I'm into extreme stuff so you might want to tone it down, but this is what i do:<br>  <br>  1. Teensy-weensy plucked eyebrows, but fill them in with eyeliner so they're defined.<br>  2. Bright color eyeshadow! I usually do purple, hot pink, or neon green. Occasionally I use black.<br>  3. Black liquid liner on top, & wing it out on the outside.<br>  4. Lots of mascara :)<br>  5. Just a little bit of eyeliner & bronze eyeshadow on the bottom. That way it looks defined, but balances out the craziness on top.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TADA! you're done. Don't put anything on your lips (except maybe chapstick) or your skin unless you need a little concealer.<br>  <br>  I like my eyes to be over-the-top, and then have everything else pale and natural.<br>  <br>  PICTURE OF THE END RESULT: <a href="http://i42.tinypic.com/11b1ykn.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i42.tinypic.com/11b1ykn.jpg</a>

lU8e0VQFaa	Ok, UV light does help the body produce vitamin D which is good for all sorts of things and can actually protect against some skin cancers (however you'd get the same help by just walking around out side for 15 minutes). They claim that less skin damage is done since you're not burning the skin, this is true to some degree, a burn is skin damage and WILL increase your risk of skin cancer but just because you don't burn doesn't mean that you're not damaging your skin. It has been shown that a little sun (again 15 minutes walking outside) can actually trip your skin into repair mode, fixing problems in the DNA strands. There's also the emotional effects of tanning, most people feel better not only from the light but from the cosmetic boost of being tan. It can also cause a short term improvement in acne but in the long run will cause more problems since tanning thickens the skin making it easier for the pores to clog.<br>  <br>  The simple fact is that sunlight/UV rays are in themselves not bad per say, it's over doing it (like anything else in life) that causes problems.
Hj6SFfK7aa	Use a soothing lip balm or Vaseline to soothe your lips after you ice your lips a bit more. Throw out the lipgloss, it definitely is an allergic reaction. The same thing happens to me with some of the Bath & Body Works lipglosses. Look at the ingredients of the gloss. Try a different brand. If you have the same reaction, compare ingredients and research it. Knowledge is power, and can definitely save time and money.|`|KHhRgzXtaa	yeah u must b allergic, it will calm down, just dont use it again,, i brought a showbag last year and there was a lip gloss in it, within seconds of putting it on my lips felt numb and swollen, i quicky rubbed it all off,,, i can only imagine if i left it on any longer<br>  <br>  im not allergic to any other lipgloss ive worn, just that brand,, so try others till u find one thats good<br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|yqVojuXVaa	Try a lukewarm wash cloth, and don't use that lipgloss again!

H3PcFertaa	There are a million and one images of butterflies that have not been made into a tattoo. You can take any picture or photo and have your tattooist make a tattoo design for you from it. You can also have your tattooist do a freehand drawing or a custom design. That way you will have a unique one of a kind personal butterfly image.<br>  Here's some inspiration:<br>  butterflies:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=butterflies&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um...</a><br>  rare butterflies:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=rare+butterflies&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um...</a><br>  drawing of butterflies:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=drawing+of+butterflies&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um...</a><br>  painting of butterflies:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=painting+of+butterflies&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um...</a><br>  butterfly jewelry:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=butterfly+jewelry&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um...</a><br>  butterfly art:<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um=1&q=butterfly+art&btnG=Search+Images" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&um...</a><br>  Put it on your shoulder blade, or your thigh.<br>  luck~|`|AA12140329	Its really cute def get it and if you want some color in it put purple <br>  and you should get it on your lower back to the corner|`|GUsxY709aa	probably in ure top left on ure back<br>  =D|`|eLrdQqQ3aa	front of hipbone or the ankle|`|jj3gaWHiaa	down stairs all the way baby!!|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	shoulder/ankle/neck/hip/foot...<br>  <br>  I mean it all depends.

kCdISEGqaa	Sorry, this is not the place to look for a job in tattooing.  Have you ever had a formal apprenticeship?  Have you ever worked in a shop?  I have never advertised a position in my shop, it is by word of mouth or I accept an apprentice and they work for me until they get established.  If you've never worked in a shop, your best bet would be to look around, get to know the local artists, and try to work your way in.|`|2dya7YeKaa	What on earth are you asking here for? Why aren't you hitting the pavement and showing your portfolio to shops in the area? <br>  <br>  The odds that someone who would be hiring at a shop where you are looking for work would be a.) looking at this site and b.) willing to hire someone who isn't even interested in taking the time to come out to the shop to look for work are pretty much astronomical.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you have not sat an apprenticeship yet which would be your first step toward getting licensed.
b2GJ5nHPaa	hi i am a beauty therapist so i know all the pros and cons to hair removal  Shaving only cuts the hair from the surface and encourages hair growth the more you shave the coarser and darker it will come back and only lasts up to 5 days max. <br>  <br>  Waxing last between 4 to 6 weeks - DONT USE COLD WAX STRIPS  they only snap the hair and dont pull them out from the root.<br>  <br>  If you want to was your own legs i advise warm wax that you heat always apply the wax the same direction that the hair grows. When you put the strip on top give it a frim rub and the remove quickly in the opposite way the haor grows.<br>  <br>  The more you wax the less you feel it your legs will appear red and dotty this is called an erythema and is normal <br>  <br>  Warm wax opens the hair follicle and allows the hair to be removed from the root therefore it takes the 4 to 6 weeks before the next hairs are formed and will start to appear. <br>  <br>  Please Note : do not bath for 12 hours after waxing as the your legs will be sensitive and after you wax apply tea tree lotion to put moisture back into the skin and exfoliate your legs twice a week to prevent ingrowing hairs this applies for shaving aswell|`|1o7hk8rKaa	i think waxing would be a right choice for you since it would be your first time, and the hair doesnt grow out for up to two weeks longer than shaving, waxing would hurt but it's a quick action, it gets done quickly, or you could always try nair or another product of that source i personally really like those types of lotions.|`|hp0ztzG0aa	i would just shave, because waxing is a hastle, and it really hurts! shaving will keep your legs usually smooth for a day or two. and i think you being twelve, thats all you need. the only painful thing is the ocassional nick or whatever.|`|UoUzfHKCaa	WAX IS BETTER THEN SHAVING.|`|HFazdzZ4aa	Agree'ing with 'char'<br>  <br>  =)|`|TYHFL5NSaa	just shave|`|0Ji5L32gaa	if you want to, then do it<br>  theres no reason y not|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	wax|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yeah i would wax them because shaving makes them thicker and waxing thins out the hair.|`|W89Q30J7aa	Shaving if done properly is a painless, quick and easy to do... But it will need repeating every 2-3 days and the hair will come back thicker and very prickly<br>  <br>  Waxing is pain full and uncomfortable for a short while after, but it will last up 2 4 weeks and if repeated regularly the hair becomes thinner and requires less frequent treatments<br>  <br>  So i'd suggest shave for a month, then get waxed and then decided :)|`|f280030b5c3fd08f70ea29f8d59505d5aa	wax, it lasts longer, and it is wayyy quicker, yet painful. sooo if you can take it than do it. if you cant, then shave|`|GLEGh4N0aa	yeh if you're self conscious you should but you're quite young talk to your mum about what would be the best way to go about it|`|fJBLg6zbaa	hmm, yeah, shave for now....

tidw3kY5aa	get a small plastic earing, then take the peircing part out you could put it on your lip instead. its cheap, and found almost anywhere|`|tFEQOsfKaa	thats trashy!!!
oqsrPBZ3aa	I got 4 tattoos.  To me it never hurt but I describe it as a hot knife running over your skin (not a cut pain).  But yes, after a while, you feel nothing really - you get used to the feeling and its over before you know it!  It really depends on your pain threshold.  Everyone is different.  It depends where you have it - the less the thickness of flesh, the more painful it is.  I have one on my lower back.....it wasn't too bad - hurt a bit more than on my belly.<br>  <br>  The outline is a bit painful as the needle goes in deeper than the filling in part.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yes it is going to hurt all tattoo's hurt but that is part of the process. It is also pretty hard to explain therefore everything you hear won't make sense when you are getting it. It's like child birth you know its painful but you can't really tell someone what to expect. Anyways they way i see it is in about 15minutes you will be use to the pain and even tho it hurts it won't be that bad. The first line is probably the hardest since it's the first time you experience it. Anyways you can say that it feels like a sun burn that is being rubbed. Make sure you take a friend to help you keep your mind off the situation. Good Luck!|`|BILIAKSOaa	I don't think you will completely stop feeling the pain, but it will grow down after a while. The back is a lot more painful area than the arm. I guess it all depends on where you have it. Like the less flesh the more pain. I'm sure you will be fine and once it's finished it will be worth it. Hope it looks great ! (:<br>  <br>  By the way, I loved the part where your like "cluck cluck."<br>  AHA (:|`|MTF0Rz90aa	Yes it is true that the pain level drops of a little over time, however it still hurts.<br>  Some tattoo places can offer "Pain free" tattoo's were a lotion is applied to the skin and this makes the tattoo virtually pain free.<br>  Ja.|`|fox5a3ePaa	No its not true and a tatto on your back is much more painful than on your arm|`|H3PcFertaa	here's a tattoo pain chart:<br>  <a href="http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/DoesItHurt.html" rel="nofollow">http://users.zoominternet.net/~rayvin/Do...</a><br>  <br>  One big thing to help you out, would be for you to calm down. Your anticipation and fear will make you tense up and cause more pain by not letting oxygen to your body parts.<br>  Practice relaxing yourself, start at your toes and work your way up. If you concentrate on doing this, instead of where you are getting tattooed, it will be better. Also, get a good nights sleep, and eat about 1 hour before going in. And, I would go in and talk to your tattooist, and watch him/her work for a while to desensitize yourself.<br>  You need to hold still to get the best work done, and then do excellent aftercare.|`|PiMcAb0Haa	To be honest i dont think it hurt at all, it felt like a burning sensation abit like when u get sunburn on holiday and after a while it does feel numb.<br>  But then it depends where on the body it is and also how thin you are, i have heard that on boney parts of the body it can be very painful.<br>  <br>  I have only had one tattoo and going for my second one on friday in a different area, so it may be a different feeling to the first time.<br>  <br>  Just got for it, if it's something u really have your heart set on im sure you would just do it without a doubt :)<br>  xxx|`|AA11037376	I have a tattoo at the top of my arm and at the top of the right side of my back and the pain is not as bad as people make out and yes after awhile it feels numb, only thing that i found was that when he was shading in it felt sore in places as he went over it. My Tiger took 3 hours to do and believe me hun if i can have one done anyone can as i am not good with pain,lol you will be fine. Good luck|`|dioPrRFjaa	on your back it wont really hurt - i have a few tattoos and am also ridiculously afraid of pain!! it feels kinda scratchy at first but then you get used to the feeling its a bit weird. everyone is different though - i would still say go for it!|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	im skinny also and have a few tattoos let me just say that i would rather get a tattoo over getting a shot anyday! lol sounds weird but its less pain. i have a farily large one on my back. i think youll do fine. i was nervous too.|`|3faz90KDaa	im covered in tats they dont hurt <br>  my father who is 68 just got his first one and said is that it he didnt feel a thing either    dont worry bout it :)|`|ZlfPl6B1aa	Depending on your pain tolerance and where the tattoo is located is whether or not you'll feel pain..<br>  <br>  Myself (8 tattoos) felt awful amounts of pain while getting the top of my foot done...(i had to stop 3 times during it!) my lower back also sucked..but the position I was in was super comfortable, so I didn't care! My top of the hips didn't really hurt all that much..inner hip near the pubic region, SUCKED a lot..maybe even as bad as the foot..both ankles howerever were a piece of cake..<br>  <br>  it depends on you!!|`|bJgz5xGzaa	I have several tattoos, and during none of my sessions did my skin go numb. The pain really isn't that bad. I mean it 'hurts', but it's totally bearable and isn't a traumatic kind of pain. It's more of a stinging/scratching pain. It does depend on where the tattoo is though. For instance, my most painful one was on the inside of my index finger, which is more boney than the other areas I've had tattooed.<br>  <br>  If you really want the tattoo, and it means something to you, then do it. The pain is totally bearable and you won't regret it if you really want the tattoo.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|bRcwqYhiaa	errmm y dont u get the tatoo done smaller, iwas thinkin of getn a tatoo done ov a butterfly on my foot, i spoke to a tatoo artist he tol me it will only take 10mins so instead ov goin through the pain for hours i think making the design smaller would b betta|`|eD51aBzlaa	im nervous about getting mine too. im getting 2 in a week. well one on sunday and one on the next saturday. one takes up ALOT of my lower back and my sides and goes up backbone. and the other one will go in between my shoulder blades. i got my belly pierced wen i was 16 and i thought it tickled lol. i laughed. and my dad is all like you will be fine it wont hurt at all. he has alot of tatts. and my gpa who is 68 jus got one and he said "is that it" when he was done so go get it! it will be worth it! just a lil bit of pain but ur back will go numb so then u wont the pain. mine will take a couple of days to do. and dad said that my back will go numb b4 it starts to hurt. lol. so im excited! its all good! <br>  good luck! ;)|`|qasOb5Jraa	Hi i have two tattoos and im 17 they didn't hurt its more irritating then anything to begin with, like being scratched really hard and then it does go numb. It's the outline that hurts more and the shadings nothing, as long as you don't tense as well make sure you relax, it really helps. One thing though you wouldn't think it but there really addictive lol Hope you like it when it's done good luck.|`|9HQVrydZaa	hi,to begin with people have differant pain tolerances.also dont know who told you your tattoo would take hours to do as thats rubbish.yes it will go numb but the only pain you would feel is a pins and needles feeling.Im a tattooist and i can assure you of what ive said as i have over 35 tattoos myself and im boney on my back and have 3 on my back.so i know what im talking about hun.so go for it and good luck.|`|hK67Kf41aa	it does go numb but not totally. i have ten tats and they all hurt with diffrent amount of pain. a tat on ur arm will feel totally diffrent on ur back leg or chest ETC .. trust me lol .. i have had my inner lip tattooed and that was nothin compared to my other tatts .. i am guessing, ir ur skinny, the guy will hit ur ribs which will hurt but not loads .. the pain is bearable and its worth it when its finished :D hope this helps :D|`|d2PqwMQMaa	I have 1 on my upper arm and 1 on my shoulder blade..I am afraid of needles and pain.., but I really like tats...I just went for it..the only thing I didn't like was the coloring, they have to use more pressure..the only way to know is to just do it.|`|V09bBUbhaa	well you do feel pain and if you want a tattoo so bad then just face the pain its nothing to fear your not going to die you know.|`|SwtENJdOaa	Wow that sounds awsome! Originality is the only way to go with a tattoo so congrats on that! I know how your feeling about experiencing the pain though. I have my whole back tattooed and yea it was painful. Not to scare you but especially on and near the bone. But the most important thing to do is relax and trust me youll get through it! I bet you when he first starts it you wont think its as bad as you thought it would be. I seem to ALWAYS think the worst of things so before I went to get first tattoo (which was my back) I was scared shitty about it. I was only 16 too. If the tattoo your getting is fairly large, then youll be offered to take breaks with it, if it is painful for you and you cant tollerate the discomfort then you can continue doing it another day. Which is normal, since I had to go back 6 times to finish mine,only because we would usually run out of time since it covered my whole back. Its all depends on your tollerance for pain. Some people, like my good friend (shes only 102 pounds and really boney) found that her tattoo hardly painful, while be on the other hand, a 150 pound 17 yr old guy, thought it hurt. Maybe im just a wimp but hey im telling you my truth lol. Best of luck with your tattoo though! I hope you go throught with it since it will be definately worth it!|`|s0lcBI5baa	Yes and no. Once a tattoo is begun, the blood rushes up to the skin to heal it. It does start to go numb, from everything going on. Tattoos hurt depending on the person. The lower back and shoulders are probably the best places to get tattoo, hence why there are so many tramp-stamps, and shoulder work done. But it all depends on the person, and how they react to tattoos and pain. <br>  <br>  Example: When tattooing my chest, I was in tons of pain, I cried, didn't want to finish it, and kept holding my breath.<br>  When my friend got hers done, she was totally fine, didn't have any pain what so ever.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I've never bought a product that gave me that wet look all day. But I did find a way to make my curls look hydrated, instead of always looking like they were dry. I put pure coconut oil in my hair before I took a warm shower and then used Giovanni Direct Leave-in and sealed with pure olive oil. This might not work for you, though. You'll just have to experiment with different hair proudcts. <br>  <br>  I've seen quidad on QVC and her products work for anyone's hair, curls and without curls, and the people who use her products look like they have wet hair, to me anyway. <a href="http://www.quidad.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.quidad.com</a> . <br>  <br>  You might also want to look into mixed chicks leave-in.

N7I1NT6Maa	Honestly, to keep my  hair that tends to curly up when I get hot straight, it requires like... three or four products.

BvjPU3wkaa	The best concealer that I have ever tried has got to be Benefit's Boi-ing.  It's a pretty heavy duty concealer.   If your dark circles are very dark I would suggest trying a concealer that has light reflective particles as the particles will reflect light and diminish the appearance of darkness.  There are plenty on the market, Rimmel's Recover is actually really good, as well as Benefit's Erase Paste.|`|7wrko11Vaa	clinique !|`|5Jvw2l7raa	Hii,<br>  Rimmel London is a brilliant brand and has a wide range of concealer shades. <br>  <a href="http://well.ca/images/large/products/rimmel-london-recover-anti-fatig_1186690370_LRG.png" rel="nofollow">http://well.ca/images/large/products/rim...</a><br>  Concealer's from Rimmel that are like that really work best.

5UV91RCkaa	You probably have oily skin.<br>  Try oil-free blush and make sure to use a primer!|`|p6AOyv6zaa	Do you put on liquid concealer/cover up or moisturizer before blush? If so, that's the reason. Try using powder concealer instead (if that is the reason). Use a larger brush and a minimal amount of blush and sweep upwards along your cheekbone to your hairline.
gfmTgLDKaa	Honestly, From this picture an 8, but the picture is too bright, and the brightness diverts away the real motive of the picture, which is your features. <br>  <br>  I can tell though that you have pretty eyes, and I see how they stand out in the picture, even though the background and the brightness mess it up. Your eyes still shine through.<br>  <br>  The nose is partially hidden by the light, and I can't comment much on that.<br>  <br>  Your lips, I can't comment on either, because your tongue is in the way! :D If that is your tongue, it looks pretty big, I like that ;D.<br>  <br>  Your hair is long and straight, just my type. But I can't see the details, texture, or the liveliness of your hair because of the light once again.<br>  <br>  Your eyebrows are finely arched, although you have them really up because of your expression.<br>  <br>  Overall, because of the circumstances I'd give you an 8.<br>  <br>  -Edit: this is an add-on, I've checked out your myspace profile, and if that is you on your interests box. Then you definitely deserve a 10. Like I said before, I just love your eyes, they were the first thing I noticed! I love your skin and your figure, from what I can see. Although, once again there is that light taking your nose away! Overall, Love it.

BtbSZabqaa	OK,  first, tanning is not a very good thing to do, especially since you have already stated that you have pasty white skin.  This is an invitation to melanoma. (if you don't know what that is it is skin cancer)<br>  <br>  But if you insist, this is a really cheap way of getting a great tan.  Get a can of Budweiser  pour it into a spray bottle and spray that on yourself.  I honestly don't know what it is but, I learned that from a cousin of mine about 25 years ago.  for some reason you get a really dark tan from it?  And if your old enough you have a great tasty beverage to drink in the hot sun!<br>  <br>  But, be careful.  If your not paying attention, the follow may happen.<br>  <br>  1) it attracts a lot of bee's <br>  2) you need to make sure you get out of the sun every so often.  Because you pasty white folk, you will fry like a beer basted chicken if you don't pay attention.  <br>  <br>  if you do it should work pretty good...|`|eKL4kJqiaa	spray on tans work very nicely. just make sure it's a place that you trust. make sure none of the ppl coming out look orange! then after that you can use some of the jergan's tanning lotion. i haven't have a problem with it streaking or splotching after a spray on.|`|v30TPwUtaa	I use Giesee but since you sound like you don't know how to use sunless tanners I would definitely not recommend it.<br>  <br>  You can buy tan enhancers from Banana Boat.

Face it, if you were a supplier of something that could not only cause a great deal of regret about a mess of an infected blob on someones body, not to mention possibly give him Hep C, or the Aids virus, you would feel a measure of responsibility about who you sell that stuff to, as well. Years ago, Huck Spaulding started selling to the general public. He may still be, I'm not sure. But you can find out by trying to order something from his supply house. Urge your brother to knock on doors, and get involved in the legitimate tattoo community.

In order to relieve some of the puffiness you are going to need to get the puffiness to go down. Some good ways to do this is before you go out, use either an ice pack, caffeinated tea bag or some sort of cool compress. This really helps the puffiness to go down. I would even try this when you wake up in the morning.<br>  <br>  You can try a concealer and see if that helps somewhat. But it can't really "cover up the bags". They will still be noticeable with concealer on.<br>  <br>  Try getting more sleep, drinking more water, and eating healthier. I know its hard to do in college - but healthy food is really the key to anti-aging and better looking skin.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

4sWc6tf5aa	Those aren't freckles, they're beauty marks, which are very common. There is no way to completely cover them unless you wear an enormous amount of make up.

It's drugstore and a great dupe for high-end Mac ones!) you need to set it before and after to have it stay on and no sweat off!<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Apply a moisturizer on a clean face.<br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Use a concealer on each of the freckles.<br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Apply foundation with fingers, a damp makeup sponge, or brush. If the coverage isn't complete, build it in thin layers, letting it dry.<br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT. Set the foundation with a powder (pressed, loose, translucent, or skin colored all work fine). This will protect your coverage from wearing off!<br>  <br>  Sincerely hope I helped!

Also, dry your hair with a hairdryer. Use the medium or light heat and wind speed, and dry slowly. Never use the highest temperature, it can damage your hair. Also, you can use special shampoos that strengthen hair against damage and breakage. Just go to a store like Target and look around. Good brands would be Pantene, Herbal Essences, Garnier, and brands like that. Good luck!|`|Y7X5fKK2aa	ok to start off do not braid it as much as you do now. and you should never brush your hair while it is wet. it causes more breaking|`|KwNpyp3saa	When you relax it again, are you relaxing only the regrowth? If you are then this might not be the problem. If you relax the whole hair again, you are damaging your hair. You might want to look into the kind of relaxer you are using. If it is the right one for you. Another question I have for you is- how tight are the braids? If they are micro braids, you may be adding too much stress to your scalp and this could be the reason for your breakage. <br>  <br>  You should also do a deep conditioning treatment weekly. Apply conditioner in your hair and wrap in a shower cap or towel and leave in for about 15 minutes. Rinse with cool water. I hope this helps you.

P7rosHBNaa	I use hydrogen peroxide to lighten my eyebrows, if you just apply it like once or twice a day it will look natural, but if it is used to much it will make your eyebrows fragile.|`|MSM66SEnaa	Well..<br>  I'd go to a professional. <br>  I got mine highlighted by someone who had no idea what they were doing and had to get it emergency colored again.

I don't think it would fry your hair.<br>  But if not.. they could always just lighten your eyebrows.
bQSjtjgQaa	I have kinda curly hair that if I put nothing in it after I shower  becomes a frizz ball, so after its dry(blow dryer or a day in a tight low ponytail) I straiten it(chi) and then carefully get the ends wet so that they will curl, once you get the ends wet dry them with a towel and just keep twisting them around your finger till they're dry. It ends up with a bit of curl at the tips and the rest stays strait like children's hair. Try and only let an inch or two get wet. the curl stays better than when i use my chi to curl it like they do in salons.<br>  Good luck?|`|SAtReshHaa	when you straighten in have it at an angle so the hair will be flipped towards your face. do each layer seperatly to give it a more bouncy, layered look. dont use hairspray.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	I would advise you to not straighten your hair so often, because when you do people can start to tell that it isn't natural, people to keep their hair healthy arer only to straighten their hair once every 2 week's.|`|UojyaVglaa	instead of using a straightening iron, try blowing it out straight instead. after you take a shower, let your hair dry naturally or blow dry it until it's about 80% dry. then, using a large diameter round brush (preferably boar bristle) take small sections just like you would using a flat iron and use the round brush instead. start at the root and work it all the way through the ends holding the blow dryer right over where the brush is. this will straighten you hair, yet still leave body and volume in it instead of making it look unnaturally stick straight.
bQSjtjgQaa	I have tried so many things to my hair, so here are some of my faves...<br>  <br>  depending on how long your hair is you can get the scrunches and wrap your hair in and out of it really tight like a braid, making a really condensed s curves. do this when its wet. separate in sections just like when you straiten it, and leave it in overnight. the result is squiggly curls and you will probably want to put the top layer in a half up half down style(personally I love the salon clips, I twist it an clip it. it looks  different for sure kinda like the chopsticks style.<br>  you can do a half up half down thing and have a princess Leigh bun in the back on each side, mix in some braids( might bean out of date style though)<br>  my newest  thing is letting my hair dry in a low pony tail and twisting the end all day so it creates a nice curl at the bottom you want to change the position of the ponytail a few times so that you don't get one big crease from it. when you let it out of the ponytail it looks really nice and wavy. this one can take some practice <br>  this one works with mid neck length strait hair and  medium long curly hair. you can mix match between pony, pig tail, and half up half down. You also need quite a few of those baby clippies, preferably to match what your wearing. Put your hair in a high pony tail, then scrunch your hair to fit on top of the pony tail in a scattered way that covers the band, then strategically place the little clips to hold your hair in the messy style. it looks really nice with curly hair if you let a bit hang down and fall from the cluster of hair, almost like a messy version of a prom updo. It takes 5 min tops, people usually think i spent a long time on it. <br>  <br>  Also brows around stares and look for unusual things to put your hair up with, that a good way to make old looks more interesting.<br>  Good luck?|`|x5NzYL8Taa	Heres a website that tells you some different tips <br>  <a href="http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/styling.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.loreal-paris.co.uk/styling.as...</a><br>  :)|`|LROAETQCaa	vv|`|dfb9b87320e57cbd3b0d12aacb92921caa	Cute?

kUE3Ddktaa	I tried both on at the store - I could wear a woman's small or a youth extra-large. I ended up getting the youth size because it was cheaper!<br>  <br>  The only thing that I'd be careful of is if you're small but chesty - the youth sizes aren't cut to accommodate curves.|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	for the most part i think it should fit.. however keep in mind your chest.. childrens sizes arent cut for a bigger chest|`|S61oU0yFaa	The xl youth actually would be a little big on you.  I am a size medium in the north face women's jacket and the xl was actually really boxy around the middle.  The sleeves are kind of short too.  I would go for a youth large or just splurge and get the women's small.  I thought I could do an xl youth too to save some money, but the women's ones are cut much better and fit a woman's body better.  Good luck!|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Why not simply try it on?

JndG75tuaa	use a primer for your eyes like Urban Decay Eyeshadow Primer Potion|`|xdF08Uqfaa	Put your make up on,and then varnish your face with clear varnish....It'll stay on all year then.That's what some ladies do here in the UK.|`|5SiFjlBGaa	maybe you should try a better cosmetic line(s). I use an almay comcealer, a chanel foundation, mac mineral powder, and nixie black eye shadow as liner and brow liner. My makeup lasts me a good 6-8 hours. Play around with a few cheap brands from your local drugstore. See which one you like. If none of them work, go to your local mall and go to the cosmetic counters and talk to an associate. They can help you out. Whatever you do, don't use airbrush/spray on makeup. The sprayer breaks apart the makeup into little particles as its being sprayed onto your face. Since there are uber tiny, dirt can get in there and go deep into your pores.|`|f5RzWf1Gaa	Well for the eyeliner use waterproof. For the lasting of everything else-use a primer/base. Even for the foundation. It creates a smoother surface for the foundation to glide on and stick to. For your eyeshadow use a base as well-if you have oily skin/eye lids look into buying some oil blotting sheets :) and toner before you even put on a primer-it cleans up most of the oil and dirt under the the surface of the skin.|`|yT8GfnfKaa	Use a primer or makeup base<br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/search/search_results.jhtml?%2Fcom%2Flvmh%2Fcommerce%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2Fiphrase%2Fproxy%2FIPhraseSearchFormHandler.search=search&_D%3A%2Fcom%2Flvmh%2Fcommerce%2Fcatalog%2Fsearch%2Fiphrase%2Fproxy%2FIPhraseSearchFormHandler.search=+&command=toggleSort&attr1=Sku+List+Price&attr2=0&v0=primer&i=Product+id&s2=Name%2F%2F1&s1=Product+TopSellers%2F%2F0&s0=iphrase+relevance%2F%2F0&as=1&q=15&s=297235057252&t=0&c0=i%3A770%3BCategory%2CDescription%2CName%2CNo+Show+Category%2CProduct+Keywords%2CSku+Name%3Bprimer%3B%3Aprimer%3B%2B0&searchString=&_DARGS=%2Fsearch%2Fsearch_results.jhtml" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/search/search_results...</a>|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I do use a small amount of foundation on my eyelids. I also use a face and eye primer. This really helps your makeup stay on longer.|`|OgcdoEDvaa	Applying foundation and powder on your eyes before the liner and shadow will help it last longer... and then throughout the day it is best to use your compact powder to lightly blot on your eye lids, nose, cheeks etc. Using the powder over the top of the shadow and/or blush like this will help set it in as the hours pass. You can also use press powder over your lipstick to make it last longer, although it will give you a matte look. And as far as working out with make up on goes, it's wise to choose a very light weight foundation. To make sure that it doesn't look streaky or run while sweating you must apply it properly first. It is important to not just smear it on, but rather apply it evenly in small circles using your finger tip or a make up sponge. Then finish this off with loose translucent powder that you apply with a large puffy make up brush. Also, be sure to prep your face well. Are you using a good soap, toner and light moisturizer? That's important.|`|bksZg2BBaa	I dont think  so  but if u refresh your makeup like at lunch or after gym ull wont look so sloppy also go with natural looking substances so u cant tell that itss running also use oil free stuff|`|9RHmTygyaa	Si ..it works...if ur not comfortable..try getting the waterproof mascara with the waterproof eyeliner...lol|`|GYqu1txiaa	yes the concealer does work on your eyes when you wear eye shadow or liner.|`|zKf7nUI4aa	Use primer, or i would buy some water proof makeup!! :]|`|EOL6PEvgaa	Herbalife mist... spray it on your face every time you put makeup and it will last all day!!|`|j2WZPQNMaa	buy the good kind|`|U2U624i5aa	exspensive makeup stays on all day like merle norman :)|`|iWLPGpoCaa	My make-up lasts me all day. <br>  My routine is to apply bare minerals foundation.<br>  Bare minerals eye-shadow, it works great.<br>  My eyeliner is the blackest-black glimmer stick from Avon, and my mascara is full and soft from Maybelline.<br>  My lip-gloss lasts me a pretty long time to, its the Yearning from Victoria's Secret Very Sexy collection.|`|SqFmGtjjaa	Try wetting a cloth (damply) and putting it over your face (hot water) then apply makeup, works for me!|`|msRMYvcYaa	put baby powder on before<br>  you put on your makeup the oil on your face<br>  makes your make up come off

dt2Vl76Gaa	I use John Frieda lustrous touch shampoo and conditioner, as well as the John Frieda clear shine glaze, which makes your hair shinier over time.<br>  I use Moroccan Oil, which is this oil for your hair that is light an absorbs quickly, the only setback is that it's about $40. but it's really good. I use Herbal Essences curl gel, garnier fructis hairspray and pantene pro-v curling mousse.|`|JZMfUDylaa	ISO bouncy cream. Really good stuff because it keeps my hair wavy for a couple of days and it doesn't make it stiff! I am currently using garnier fructis color shield to keep in my thick honey blonde high lights but thanks to my friends little sister's research I learned about that using apple cider vinegar and baking soda is better for your hair than shampoo and conditioner itself. The apple cider vinegar and baking soda helps get rid of all gunk and bad oil out of your hair and it makes your hair light so it will come in handy for my high lights. They put a lot of harsh chemicals in shampoo and con. that you buy, that can be really damaging to your hair and the reason they do that is so you will buy more of their product in hoping that that product will help when really it doesn't.

wn85sBGJaa	From what you describe it doesn't sound like you need to lose any weight, but to just tone your muscles. If you have a Wii you might look into getting a Wii fit, and you can just do some simple exercises every day to tone up your muscles. It's refreshing to see somebody on here who is happy with their weight though! Also refrain from snacking a TON, that way you don't give up any meals, and it's healthier. You may consider looking into a vegetarian diet, it's a really healthy thing and it slims you down, I'm a vegetarian (for personal choices though). Good luck, and remember to stay happy with who you are!|`|yvAyaiMdaa	First of all who is telling you that you need to lose weight, you are a tall girl and 140# for someone of you height is just fine, maybe instead of losing weight you need to tone your body. My daughter is 5'8 and 135# and she does track and her body is rock hard. In the end and it's you who has to like what she see's in the mirror, so who cares what other think.   PS I think  you look great a very healthy your women, I should know am a mom.|`|hLozB0MUaa	me-exact same sitchyashun! lol idk, i'm not losing weight either, it's so hard!!!|`|msNXomjTaa	You did not say how old you are, but I would suspect if you are a teenager at least, you will not be able to look like the 2nd picture.<br>  <br>  She has the body of a very young girl - like when boys and girls basically have the same body.  Usually, around 12 or so, a girl begins to turn in to a woman - this means curves.  Many girls think they are getting fat, when actually their bodies are changing from skinny kids to curvy women.  The girl in the picture is probably a late developer, or one of those who will have a little girl body until adulthood (which happens, but is not that common).<br>  <br>  At 5'7" and 140lbs, you are on the very low side of average.  A quick rule of thumb is to add 5-10lbs for every inch over 5'0".  You should be 135-170.  This depends on age, and body type, but it does give a rough idea.  <br>  <br>  Remember, the key is having a healthy body.  Too skinny is not healthy, for a whole set of reasons.|`|2erBmZAYaa	stay away from white carbohydrates, such as bread, potatoes, milk, ect.<br>  Don't drink calories, if you do, drink green tea. take in as much water as possible.<br>  on saturdays, piiiiiigg outt so much that you won't want to touch sweets for the rest of the week.<br>  <br>  its a good diet, and you can even skip the pigging out and it would be better :p|`|AA10755943	I'd recommend you get into aerobic exercise.

nrTVlo8Eaa	Don't put lotion on it just yet. The dryness you're seeing is most likely the peeling from the swelling going down. You don't want to irritate the new piercing with perfumes, or, clog the whole thing with products.<br>  <br>  You're doing exactly the right thing by spraying both holes with H2Ocean. Take it with you and spray it 4 to 6 times a day. The warm salt water soaks are also a good idea, but almost unnecessary since the H2Ocean accomplishes the same thing.<br>  <br>  Don't pick at the crusties with dirty hands. NEVER NEVER NEVER. Also, never ever use alcohol or alcohol based products to clean it; never use hydrogen peroxide to clean it and don't use any petroleum based products such as neosporin on it. These products just slow the healing process down that much more. Read about proper aftercare at <a href="http://www.bmezine.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com</a><br>  <br>  You'll find, even with meticulous after care, that navel piercings take forever to heal because there's so much movement at the waist; both up and down and side to side.<br>  <br>  If you get infected, and you probably will, just keep up the salt water treatment every day and be patient. The piercing WILL heal eventually. <br>  <br>  The only reason you'd have to abandon the piercing is if the placement was incorrect, or too small for the jewelry. In that case, you'd notice rejection taking place. This is easy to fix: abandon the piercing, let it heal, and then have it repierced correctly the second time.<br>  <br>  Good luck and take care of it. It'll be  fine.|`|DErBSfZgaa	Believe it or not the crusties helps it heal, and are like a form of<br>  cover against bateria. Son don't ALWAYS take it off. <br>  make sure you clean it atleast twice a day, and keep using<br>  the salt water because it really helps.<br>  <br>  Don't put lotion on it.|`|7ki9mfh6aa	all you can really do is keep cleaning it.<br>  use soap and water in the shower,<br>  and i use alchohol or peroxide to clean my piercings.<br>  <br>  alchohol works the best:)|`|M8a4Qe2Maa	Never put lotion on it or anything that contains alcohol either. If you stop banging it off stuff it'll heal and be fine, but it'll probably be sore (if it is) for a bit until it recovers. Crusties are a good sign because it shows the piercing is healing so you want crusties even though they're gross. Do the sea salt twice a day for about 10 minutes. It should heal and go back to normal if you start taking better care of it.

MjPvMY8Baa	i dont really understand either. Dewy could mean drenched eyes or it could mean clean I'll type you out clean but that's all i know<br>  <br>  First start by getting rid of your bags( i use a lipstick like tub on concealer by chanel)<br>  Blend that in and get rid of any pimples<br>  Then use your foundation powder( make sure this really  matches your skin- bare minerals is great but that makes mr feel as though i am wearing too much. Try Sephora powder. They have several colors and shades which match well)<br>  Add a little bronzer if you desire NO ALOT!!<br>  Use an eye shadow base that is creamy and has a glitter hue( try mary kay)<br>  Put that on your lids<br>  Now you're going to need three colors for eye shadow ( light pink, light maroon and tan i have all 3 in a Chanel pack)<br>  put the pink where you put the base. on the lid of the eye. make sure it is even all around he lid<br>  add a little pink under your brow<br>  and the tan by your nose. you want the edge of your eye to be pinker than the inside<br>  add the maroon in the crease. <br>  liquid eye liner would be preferable for this step.. they're all the same. Try urban decay in a brown. put that across the top of your eye as close to your lashes as possible<br>  add blush(SMILE) dont use too much<br>  you should look fresh now!<br>  add some gloss try a tan lipstick then a pink gloss <br>  as for mascara try to make your lashes long and not clumped i like the new cover girl LASH BLast... enjoy|`|a1KT2SQlaa	fix + spray by mac|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Lancome with oil helps|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	i don't really understand. but i kind of know what you mean.<br>  just curl your lashes and apply some mascara.<br>  then apply blush!<br>  <br>  something natural. . no eyeliner , eyeshadow.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	It's really all in the face, not necessarily eye or lip colors. <br>  <br>  Use Biore Skin Boosting Night Serum in the AM before applying foundation. <br>  Use Neutrogena Healthy Skin Glow Sheers Natural Radiant Look SPF 30 for your face, applied with a Foundation brush of your choice.

REAd52Nlaa	I love it and have been using it for 4 years and have not had any problems with it at all. Mine lasts for a little over a year, which is great because I always buy to much when I go into the makeup store. lol.  If I were you I would go somewhere were they sell it and try it for a day, most places that sell it do free makeovers. That way you know how it looks on you and if is irritates your skin :) That's what I did, and I went back and bought it the next day, I love it so much! As far as the price goes, I think that it's worth it, you are only supposed to use a little bit at a time, so it will last you for a long time. And as for what the one person said about having to use the finishing powder, I never do, and people are always asking how I keep my skin looking so good. Most people don't even realize that I use foundation, which is just what I want :)  I hope that this helps!|`|wFN8bVqsaa	LOVE IT! All of my friends swore by it, and finally I decided to try it out.

It has a flawless look to it, and it lasts all day. Mine lasted a few months.

0f6mGogcaa	Plato's Closet is a good store to shop at, its like a goodwill for name brand clothes.  Also another good store to shop at is "GOODWILL"  don't think because its a thrift shop that its nasty or bad clothes.  If you can find some cute stuff there.  Yeah, I'm sure most of it is out of date and ugly, but once in a while you can find some good stuff in there.  <br>  <br>  There is 100% nothing different between Plato's Closet and Goodwill.  They are both selling other peoples old clothes.  Plato's closet is just a little more picky on what they take, and they sell stuff for more money because they can.  <br>  <br>  As for the skinny jeans, I"m not sure what to tell you.  I don't find them to be cute, so I would say stick with the flare jeans. <br>  <br>  Also, stores like Target, TJ Max, and Wal-Mart have lots of cute clothes!<br>  <br>  My fav store of all time is TJ Max!!!|`|yESGH991aa	you can go to easy pickins (the jeans there are 10 dollars and they sell skinny jeans at the price too), Mandees, or Forever 21. To make skinny jeans cut one side of the botton part on each side. Put then on and wrap the bottom around your legs to find your comfort. Put thoseneedles with the ball on it so you know where u want it sewn. FInally, take out that needle and sew it. For an edgy alternative, dont put the pin with the ball thingy on top, just put pins along the bottom of it. My friend did that and it looked awesome (: Good Luck!|`|4ig5netwaa	seriously...go to thrift stores and department stores, it takes a little more effort to find stuff but when you do you can customize it to make it "you" and not many people will be wearing what you have.|`|SIE3HuHRaa	Check out old navy! They have a jean sale going on right now. Any clothes DIY is sure to turn out a disaster if you arent trained as a tailor and stuff!|`|AA10370707	Thrift stores are your best friend for cheap clothing. You have to hunt through the racks to find good stuff but it is completely worth it, trust me! Also, to make skinny jeans:<br>  <br>  To start, find a pair of flare jeans and make sure that you really do want to alter them.<br>  <br>  1. Turn the flare jeans inside out and put them on.<br>  <br>  2. Get a lot of safety pins (about 30) to use in the alteration.<br>  <br>  3. Starting about halfway down you thigh, pinch the seam on the outside side of the jeans, and pull outward. Then, using a safety pin, make the pants snug by vertically pinning the safety pin into both layers of the jean material. Make the jeans snug for about 3 large safety pins (that are touching at the ends) or until you get to the point right above your knee. The point above your knee is about the legnth of one large safety pin.<br>  <br>  4. Now, beging pinning the material (at a slight angle for the first few pins) about a vertical finger width away from your leg.<br>  <br>  5. Keep on pinning in a line that goes straight to the ground after you pass your knee, and then starting at the knee, pin the inside of the jeans the same way.<br>  <br>  6. It is VERY IMPROTANT to now turn the jeans right side out and try them on. if you pinned them too tightly anywhere, simple take them off and re-pin them where it was too tight.<br>  <br>  7. Repeat on other pants leg, and then sew a seam along the outside side of the safety pins, removing the pins as you sew.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions, e-mail me at alligatorperson13@yahoo.com|`|ZnDK3dHIaa	Try Charlotte Russe, which is EXTREMELY cheap, or wetseal, if your going for bulk shopping. all of their stuff is super cheap, and you can find some cute stuff. If you want a little bit more expensive then try Delias, Alloy, Forever21, H&M, or Urban Outfitters. <br>  <br>  And I am uberly jealous that you can make your own skinny jeans.|`|DKiftd4Naa	Go to TJ Max or Marshalls if you can find one. Or look at Lord and Taylor. They have tons of unique brand name stuff that no one will have seen before. I love these stores and I'll never pay full price again.<br>  <br>  Some clothes you find there are from sample sales, overstock or just test runs that major brands put out. Nothing wrong with them. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, look at a thrift store- you can clean up, re-dye and modify any of the stuff you find there for a super unique look. It's what a lot of fashion designers do in my city and they sell them for big $.|`|xNUQs9qMaa	forever 21. cute, cheap, trendy. so they're also unique.|`|y1MdH9bZaa	wet seal i got some shirts for $5 each and some skinny jeans for $15 dollars each they have them in colors and in reg. blue jeansss also chekc forever 21|`|QuokZhuqaa	<a href="http://www.forever21.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com</a><br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com</a><br>  <br>  &<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delias.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.delias.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  (:|`|CV4bDv65aa	Forever 21, Wet seal, Target and Kohl's are all amazing.

NyhP8Gzbaa	my mom doesn't die her hair and she started 2 have grey when she was 33 .|`|nSSCWkBlaa	absolutely not!!!!  Greying is related almost 100% to genetics ......other factors can include stress , and illness , but the application of hair color has nothing to do with it !!!|`|kygBk5sAaa	lol same, Just ask my mom =), she use to dye her hair to different colors a lot . She now is grey so now she dyes it for a different reason lol|`|zfrPmiFtaa	How does that even make sense? Hair dye is coloring your hair, and when it grows out it stays on the part of the hair. How would it make you grey earlier?|`|nn8AdxnZaa	yes<br>  my mother reminds me everyday, thats why we have to keep dyeing our hair lol
0NYQNr9saa	If it's grey you can put another colour over the top.  If not it'll probably have to be black or a dark colour, unless you get it lasered first.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Let me get this straight - do you already have the first tattoo that you're considering covering over?<br>  <br>  If not, then please don't get it. You really shouldn't get a tattoo if you're already thinking about ways to change it. The whole point of tattoos is that they're permanent, and covering them or removing them is a pain in the backside.<br>  <br>  If you do already have the tattoo and just worded the question a little weirdly... then yes you can have cover up tattoos but it really depends on the colours and style of the tattoo you want to cover over. If it's just that you want the same tattoo in a different colour - then your base colour will need to be much lighter than the colour you intend to put over it. Colours are transparent. So if you put red over blue, you'd come out with a dingy purply colour. If you have black, you haven't got a hope of covering it with anything other than more black. I would talk to your artist and see what you can work out with him. But if you don't already have the tattoo - just do yourself a favour and don't go there - not until you have a design you'll never want to change. If you want something temporary, try henna.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	yes i have done it a few times...  the only bad part is the new one will be a little bigger and darker...  But in can be done...|`|95hnLTSaaa	u could get the color u want removed and try getting a diffrent color and putting a tattoo over the 1 u have depends wat tattoo u want
KH9HROrSaa	yep it helps remove buildup that dulls your hair.<br>  <br>  -towel dry your hair.<br>  -fill a spray bottle with about a 1/4 cup of vinegar.<br>  -spritz all over.<br>  -massage it through your hair.<br>  -leave it on for 5 minutes.<br>  -wash until the smell is gone.<br>  <br>  for future reference, a clarifying shampoo is a lot more effective and it doesn't make your hair stink. try suave, its about $1.|`|u1FlCXL0aa	yeah it does<br>  You do in the shower.....<br>  but you don't put alot of vinager the ration is 1 to 4<br>  4 cups of water to on cup of vinegar<br>  thats what i do|`|ghISlqExaa	You are supposed to put vinegar into your hair before taking a shower/washing your hair. You put the vinegar into your hair and rub it in and keep it in for 10 mins, put a plastic bag over your head. Wash your hair with your regular shampoo and conditioner afterwards. Wash it well because it will smell otherwise. :)|`|A6tkE0fAaa	yes it does, use it when your washing
l6OMftUkaa	do a vinagar rinse (type in "vinagar rinse" on google) it is supposed to relieve your hair of all build up and it is safe to use on the scalp or try using a bit of baking soda and mix it with water and use as a shampoo|`|sOkTUYq7aa	is it residue, or just dandruff?<br>  Try the Herbal Essences Degunkify shampoo (green bottle).

ZFNXq0FWaa	So i just curled my hair today and i totally understand where your coming from,<br>  heres my adivice:<br>  dont wash your hair on the day of the curling! The night before or sometime the day before works much better. The oils in your hair make the curls hold better and also will make your hair look shinier and more attractive! Also make sure your curling iron is hot!<br>  Well i hope this helps :)|`|lSr7u0mSaa	mine does the same thing ! but i just put mousse in my hair before i curl it,and it hols for a long time ! i dont think what i told you is what you were looking for, but i just wanted to suggest it .|`|PJrdb15qaa	what you could do is at night use a little leave in conditioner (like infusium 23) and set your hair with rollers and when you get up you'll have a lot of curls. hope this helps you out|`|AA12128230	I have the same problem but what I do is I dont wash my hair the day I am going to curl it. What helps me is I use a dry shampoo and make sure the curler is hot and when you are taking the curler of do it carefully and dont touch it until it cools also a great alternative to hair spray is a little bit of mousse before you curl it works great but make sure its alchohol free that way it does not damage your hair because the hot curler.|`|tlzJvBSOaa	put the curling iron in postition and then sing the abc's. then take it out and dont touch it until it cools. :) my hair doesnt like to curl either but my mom told me it works better without hairspray like that|`|ee9AoGPMaa	Heat Styling<br>  Curling irons make the process easy. The hair must be dry, and there are many different iron sizes available. Small sizes create a tighter curl while large barrels create looser, more open curls. When the hair is wrapped around the barrel, it is reshaped as the heat breaks the hair's natural pattern. After releasing the hair, the curl forms as the hair cools. To ensure the longevity of your curls, spritz hair all over with a light hairspray both before and after curling. <br>  <br>  Flat irons are traditionally used for hair straightening, but they also act as superb hair curlers. Using an iron no larger than one and a half inches wide and made with ceramic plates, begin by taking a two inch section of hair and clasping it from the top in the iron. The sectioned hair that hangs below the iron's grip should then be wound over the iron (essentially, you will lift it up and bring it over the top of the iron so that it forms a loop over the appliance). Next, rotate the iron so that the looped hair faces back down. Finish by sliding the iron slowly down (just as you would while straightening). The result is a magnificent curl. Practice makes perfect, but once this trick is mastered it is quite simple. <br>  <br>   Curls without heat.Hot rollers require a bit more time. Start with clean, dry hair. Apply a styling cream from roots to ends. Separate and clip the hair into three sections (one on each side and one at the back). Release one section, brush it out to remove any tangles and mist with a light hairspray. Taking a two inch section from the hair you've released, wrap it around a hot roller making sure to roll it all the way to the scalp. Do this until your entire head is covered with rollers. Mist light hairspray over the entire head and allow the rollers to set for at least 20 minutes. Release the rollers, finger comb the curls.<br>  I know hairspray is in it...but if you find a good light hairspray it will make the hair hold way better...just spray very light with light hold.|`|9OjelayMaa	Wave it with a curling iron. Take a section of hair and let it sit on the iron for about two to four seconds. No more than that. When you have finished doing your whole head, slightly, and I really mean slightly, tease the ends of your hair a little. Brush it out and your hair will stay all day. It also creates a natural wave which is beautiful.|`|xPoenaMpaa	first of all whats with the 10 points thing everyone is doing that now..<br>  you can't give 10 points!<br>  <br>  anyway itz called a curling iron.......<br>  <br>  %|`|PNdtSrgZaa	hold it 4 a while and wait untill it cools to touch it1 works every time cause i dont like hairspray when i curl either!

To make your dull looking face look fresh and bright, rub the milk ice cube on the face. It will moisten your face and bring it some life.<br>  <br>  - Don't use a lipstick for more than 8 months, bacteria develops in it and it is harmful for health.<br>  In fact, make sure you buy lipstick with no or very less lead content, as it causes cancer.<br>  <br>  Check this link to know what lipstick has high lead content (including good ones like dior) and a list of lipsticks that have very low lead: <a href="http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11/is-your-lipstick-safe-lead-in-lipstick.html" rel="nofollow">http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11...</a><br>  <br>  - instead of toner, use natural rose water as toner. It is very good for skin.<br>  <br>  - Spray perfume in the air (at your body level) and walk through it, this way it would spread well all over your clothes and last longer.<br>  <br>  - Use Scarves to brighten up your outfit and create different look. <br>  Check this link on Scarves: <a href="http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11/scarves-fashion-item-to-pep-you-up.html" rel="nofollow">http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11...</a>|`|U90ZvDlgaa	Follow these tips:<br>  <br>  Always apply your moisturiser in upwards sweeping motions. Dragging it down your face will only cause skin to sag. A mini massage will boost circulation too, so rub in the cream in circular motions.<br>  <br>  If you’ve overdone the fake tan, don’t panic! Look for body lotions that contain alpha and beta hydroxyl acids like Palmers Skin Smoothing Lotion. It boosts the speed that skin exfoliates.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your skin gets shiny, don’t apply loads of powder, as it makes skin look clogged. Instead, mist your face with facial spritz, the blot with tissue to lift excess oil and freshen. Powder if you need to. Try The Body Shop Vitamin Face Mist.<br>  <br>  Hope this aswers your question :)|`|wPT33kEUaa	i put moisturizer in my hand and feet mitts and wear them to bed to keep the skin soft and feeling nice<br>  i also use extra virgin olive oil to remove make-up and revitalise my skin|`|2wrAX0qaaa	use mineral make up!!!its the best make up for your skin!!! but i guess thats more like a beauty secret and not a tip...

cxNLOPHNaa	No, not true. Just an old wives tale. You're getting a second gray hair, because you're aging and getting a few grays, that's all. Not because you pulled that first one out.<br>  <br>  I started getting gray hair at your age. I got a dozen or so gray hairs, between ages 23-27. I kept pulling them out faithfully every two months. After age 27, I never got any new ones until I hit age 40. Then every year since it seemed I got a few new ones just before my birthday. I'm age 46 now, and have about 3 dozen gray hairs. If that old wives tale were true, then I should have many more gray hairs than I do. Especially since, I still pull them all out. I don't have enough gray hairs growing in, to make me take up dye, yet.|`|avlVHXDCaa	Don't pull it out just dye ur hair the same color it is|`|IuP9LZZUaa	Yes, this was proved by scientists who write for the American Journal of Medicine in 1948 in the famed "Gray Haired Ape Test." During this test, the scientist took an Ape and raised it. When it's first gray hair was produced the scientist documented the date and the place. With 24 hours of this happening, 10 more gray hairs appeared in that ones place. They continued the experiment, removing all gray hairs each day. Just over one year after the scientists began the experiment it ended. The results were an entirely gray ape . So, yes, I am sorry, you are going be to "gray" within the next calender year.|`|7N0hbw6Taa	not true, but if you have grey hair's coming, you oviously have more.
shc2YpAAaa	Sometimes it works a little too well.... My friend and i both used it. For me it worked just as i wanted it too but i have never dyed my hair. She has, and it BLEACHED her hair albino! I would suggest testing it on a spot that you wouldn't mind a highlight on, just in case. I don't know if they dye has anything to do with it, because she also has really fine hair, and i don't. But, test it first on a small lock of hair so you don't get it bleached white.|`|avlVHXDCaa	yes if u sit under it the color would come better<br>  and about 4 hours<br>  my mom would always make me wait for hours and some time under the sun and it would come out perfect

Try putting ice on it to reduce the soreness. But if that doesn't work, see a doctor. :)

vRZolfOraa	I have exactly the sam problem! And as my hair dresser keeps telling me, the only way to prevent split ends is to have a regular trim!<br>  <br>  But if you are trying to grow your hair, try using a repair and protect shampoo and conditioner that is especially formulated for dry hair and split ends. Also if you use any heat stylers (such as a hairdryer or straighteners) on your hair make sure you protect your hair first with a heat defense spray or other spray specially designed to protect hair from heated tools.<br>  <br>  Other tips to try is use a comb to brush your hair - they are not as harsh as hairbrushes and try not to over brush your hair. Also try and refrain from over styling or playing with your hair as constantly snagging hair elastics and scrunchies out of your hair can split your hair more.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  xxx|`|sMTVcfiVaa	Once you get split ends, that's it. You can't stick them back together, so you HAVE to cut them off. Get your hair trimmed. Your hair grows back healthier once it's cut, so it's always a good idea to get regular haircuts. It will only be a little bit shorter for a few weeks.|`|UojyaVglaa	once the damage is done there is absolutely nothing you can do for spit ends. in fact if you don't cut them off they will just spit up the hair shaft further, causing your hair to break off which is entirely counterproductive to growing your hair out. if you get them trimmed regularly every few months or so your hair will grow out long and healthy.|`|8pZBZG7Iaa	Some causes include:<br>  <br>  Excessive use of hot styling tools (irons, hot curlers, blow dryers, hot combs). <br>  Overuse of chemical treatments (relaxers, perms, hair color). <br>  Use of inferior styling tools that rip or snag hair (cheap synthetic brushes or combs, brush rollers, etc.,). <br>  Environmental damage from heat, cold, wind and other climate issues. <br>  Lack of routine maintenance such as regular trimming. <br>  Improper detangling techniques. <br>  Overwashing. <br>  Use of inferior hair care products. <br>  Excessive use of styling products such as gels, waxes and sprays. <br>  Trimming with inferior scissors. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Trick To Temporarily Repair Split Ends<br>  For a temporary split-free finish follow these steps:<br>  <br>  Shampoo hair and use a moisturizing formula like Phytojoba or similar.   <br>  Use a good rinse out conditioner making sure to slather the ends where the splits exist. <br>  Rinse well and then do a cool to cold rinse to seal the hair's cuticles and ends, adding instant sleekness and glossiness. <br>  Towel blot and then apply your favorite leave-in conditioner like Phyto 7, Phyto 9 or similar to your damp tresses. <br>  Detangle your strands with a wide tooth comb. <br>  Pour a pea sized drop of shine serum like Phytolisse or Robert Hallowell's Shine Drops Serum into the balms of your hands.   <br>  Glide your serum coated hands over the ends of your hair making sure to focus more serum on the most frayed ends of your hair. <br>  Use a large paddle or round brush and a blow dryer and blow your hair completely dry. <br>  Make sure that the split end areas are dried as straight as possible since splits look worse when they are allowed to wave, curl, frizz or spike out. <br>  When your hair is 100% dry apply a light layer of heat protectant spray or product.  Then use a ceramic or teflon flat iron to flat-iron the bottom 1 1/2 to 2 inches of your tresses from side to side.   <br>  When you are finished flat ironing all around your head, spray with a light hairspray with silk to help maintain the temporary mending.<br>  <br>  This treatment will temporarily bind your split ends back together.  It is a little like using super glue on a broken cup.  The glue will hold the pieces together, like the serum will hold your split ends together, but ultimately they will have to be trimmed off to prevent the rest of the hair from ultimately splitting up the shaft.|`|U9QSOLUtaa	Actually, your hair will grow faster if you get rid of the split ends through a trim. Right now, the split ends are a barrier, preventing the hair from growing well. Go to the salon as ask for just a trim, and that will get rid of your split ends and promote healthy hair growth.|`|49139d951a4134b87ccf7193a9401347aa	there is a way to get rid of spit ends without geting ur hair trimmed or short..<br>  go to a gud reputated saloon and ask for this remedy..<br>  i hav done this..<br>  they will twist a buch of hair nd split ends comes out from side nd dey cut it ..they repeat it many times i dnt remember d terminology of this treatment jst go nd ask it in saloon dey will let u knw..

All that matters is if it looks good on you. <br>  <br>  If you're concerned about looking "cool", don't shop at Target or the mall- everyone's seen that stuff before and chances are they'll know where you got it, when and how much you paid.|`|iDTeJAGQaa	I say, if target has cool clothes that you like, get them!

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Hi, playmate, <br>  <br>  A texturizer is a low grade relaxer. You should not put a relaxer over another relaxer because this could lead to over-processed hair and all your hair could fall out (beleive me, I overlapped a relaxer twice and my hair fell out both times). Let your relaxer grow out and then get a texturizer, if that's what you want. <br>  <br>  1. Virgin hair is hair that has never been chemically treated (color/texturizer/relaxer/curly perm/etc). I would think you can put it over color-treated hair, but you should ask a professional to be sure; I just know that you can add hair dye over a texturizer and relaxer. <br>  <br>  2. Yes. Unless you want to risk going nearly bald. <br>  <br>  3. <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com</a> - this forum is for most hair types (relaxed, texturized, natural, curly perm) and there are a few threads created by people with texturizers and you can get advice and tips there as well as general hair advice. <br>  <br>  4. It depends. A relaxer completely straightens your hair. A texturizer will loosen your natural curl pattern. This are two different things and will depend on what you want. Some people will under-process their relaxer so that it will give the same effect as a texturizer, this is called textlax. <br>  <br>  5. Yes, you can use heat on it. Many people who use texturizers at the forum I gave you above use flat irons to straighten their hair. <br>  <br>  HTH.|`|u1FlCXL0aa	1.do I have to have virgin hair for my hair to be curly when i get it<br>  (to use a texturizer, u have to have hair that not relzxed....it doesnt have to be virgin but you have to grow out all your relaxed hair)<br>  <br>  2.should I let my perm grow out before I get one<br>  (YOU HAVE TOO...theres no way you can get it with a perm. THE SAFE WAY)<br>  <br>  3. Where can I more info<br>  (<a href="http://www.curlyhairsalon.com/texturizers.html...THIS" rel="nofollow">http://www.curlyhairsalon.com/texturizer...</a> IS WHERE I LEARNED ALL MY INFO)<br>  <br>  4. Is it better than a relaxer<br>  (well you'll learn that texturizer and a relaxer are the same thing the only diffrence is the texturizer leaves the perm on for less time and doesnt complety straigthen hair)<br>  <br>  5.can Ouse heat more on it<br>  (Yes you can use heat....but you shouldnt. If you want straight hair get a relaxer)|`|9OjelayMaa	Relaxers are better if you want that pin straight look. Texturizers are good for some volume in your hair because it preserves a little bit of the wave in your hair. Virgin hair is hair that has never been chemically processed or cut. The roots that grow out after a relaxer or a hair colour session would be considered virgin hair.
TpEGKOFNaa	Well, there are a few things you could do.<br>  <br>  You could be patriotic and put the Australian flag on your foot, or put the shape of Australia. <br>  <br>  If you feel like going extreme, you could put a Kangaroo, Koala, or something else that reminds you of your country, and instead of the traditional colors of that thing, you could make it with the Australian colors, or Australian flag behind it.

It will end up looking choppy...in the really bad, chop cut way. Go to a hairstylist and have her cut in some layers for you. But if you do insist on doing it yourself, then yes, esentially that is what you do. Start from the bottom up. And clip any pieces of your hair that you dont want to get cut.

AA11901859	I would be more concerned about finding a creeper on the internet rather than an ugly guy, but no, it isn't terrible to want to find someone that is attractive.  If you base your opinions of guys off only looks, then that's bad, but there's nothing wrong for hoping for a cute one|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	i think if you like someone enough<br>  no matter what your first opinion of them was<br>  you will start to find that person more and more attractive<br>  so give it some time <br>  maybe you will start to think he is more attractive<br>  and no, i would rather be in a relationship <br>  with someone who respected and cared for me <br>  rather than someone who i just thought was hot<br>  if i can have both, then great<br>  but if not, that i'd rather be with the person <br>  that i loved spending time with<br>  its not too bad what you said<br>  but ya i think its a little harsh <br>  if you dont know him personally <br>  and have never talked to him<br>  you dont even know if  there is a good connection <br>  it might have just been a bad picture..|`|9dd18f9e6c34eb25a0a374720657f305aa	I would never date someone I wasn't physically attracted to.

I couldn't imagine anyone fainting while getting an industrial piercing, but I am sure someone has.<br>  <br>  I think you can get 2 barbells, but honestly, using the bar is better to make sure both holes heal correctly with correct placement.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I wouldn't trust anything from Claire's.  Most of their jewelery is sub par.  A professional piercer will not use someone else's jewelery.  Professional piercers use 316L surgical grade stainless steel.  Which is vital to your piercing healing correctly.  Claire's jewelery is less than stellar, mostly plated jewelery with nickel which a lot of people are allergic to.|`|h8OqX12Haa	i had my industrial for almost a year now i had 2 hoop rings for 5 months then i changed it into the bar but im tihnking about changing it into the hoops again <br>  it will hurt but now a lot but healing wil lbe worse as you will probably hit it with the comb or hairbrush you can catch it while your getting dressed <br>  etc... <br>  i paid 30$ for the piercing plus 20$ for 2 hoop rings and then i bought that industrial bar which cost me 35$

I wore lipgloss in highschool, very low-maintenance. I started wearing it a lot when i was 18. I was allowed to wear makeup in highschool, but I just usually wore lipgloss because I didn't see a need for makeup because I had clear and naturally rosey skin. But since I started, I look washed out without it. <br>  <br>  I think natural-looking makeup is okay around 13|`|dCPH9pGgaa	You really need to show her that you understand where she is coming from, but that you are mature enough to not go over board with it.<br>  <br>  Maybe start off with saying you want something like a lipgloss, then a clear mascara...<br>  <br>  Work your way up, but don't throw any tantrums or argue about it, as she will most likely stick to her word if you do.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps :)|`|NL5I2jbvaa	Wearing makeup isn't all that important.  I believe I started in maybe 8th or 9th grade.  If your mother doesn't feel you're old enough, DON'T go behind her back.  Trust her.  She's trying to look out for her, and remember she's been around longer than you have.  I'm sure she has her reasons.|`|qSdMqVZ4aa	I was 11, but you are naturally beautiful, so if your mom doesn't want to see you with goop on your face, than don't wear it. But if you realllly need to, then ask her if you can start with something little, like eyeliner.|`|RbCsBbhLaa	I wore eye shadow forever but when I was 13 I started wearing eye liner and stuff.

I just viewed the hair journal of a girl who's stretching her perm to a year and she's on month 8; she said she usually goes 6 months between touch-ups. <br>  <br>  With my hair I had to get touch ups every 6-8 weeks or it would start breaking off. Some people can go longer than that. You'll just have to take very good care of your hair between touch-ups. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com</a> - has many threads from people who go long amounts of time between touch-ups and you can get a lot of advice and tips from them.

That's the main problem in that pic. <br>  Step two: Use a little concealer under your eyes. The best kind is bare minerals or another nicer brand of powder foundation/concealer. They cost a bit but are really natural, easy to use and don't cause pimples. <br>  Step 3: Use a little blush to warm up your cheeks and just a tiny touch on the end of your nose and on your chin to give you some color. <br>  Step 4: Buy some Sun In (at Wal Mart or Target) and drench your hair. Let it dry and repeat this until it is a bit blonder (you'll be able to see it lightening). You can also just separate a few strands and drench them over and over for some highlights. <br>  <br>  P.S. you're REALLY not ugly at all. You're cute.

0xU3YhGhaa	I think side swept bangs would look better :) <br>  I also think darkish red, blond, or light brown looks good on an asian :)<br>  hope i helped!|`|ee9AoGPMaa	There are certain shades to avoid when you have warm coloring. These include white, platinum blonde, or violet and blue shades of black. These shades have the tendency to give your coloring a washed-out look. The best shades for women of warm coloring include red, auburn, and dark or golden brown. Orange and golden highlights can often accent these colors well. Be careful when opting for a lighter shade, such as golden blonde. This can give you a striking look, but it may also clash with your natural skin tones. Because Asian hair is difficult to color, it may be necessary to choose a color that is a shade or two lighter than what you want. Then you will be sure to achieve the look you desire. And both bangs will work great with your face...just  get the right hair color thats the trick ;)|`|9OjelayMaa	Those are both the exact same thing.|`|TvyEB2i7aa	SIDE SWEPT|`|cIzyMg0haa	hm, side swept def' :)<br>  um, maybe red? or browwn.. :)|`|pIMXHktGaa	whats the difference between side and side swept?|`|NIIF3tG4aa	side swept-defiantly!<br>  side bangs kinda make people look trashy -no offense to anyone who has that already-<br>  but side swept bangs are sorta in right now,<br>  and look great on almost anyone.|`|NrXDYAPGaa	Side bangs <br>  Get dark blue highlights!!|`|xPoenaMpaa	How long is it?<br>  and it just depends how it looks on your face cuz on some people it can look really good and on other people it can look not good.....<br>  <br>  sorry iiiidddkkkk|`|HP4AGp9Uaa	side swept bangs duhh!!?!|`|xNUQs9qMaa	wait arent those the same thing?

A4dc4Heoaa	OK...i just tried this on my ridiculously dry, frizzy, tight curly  hair today, and i can't believe how absolutely GORGEOUS  my curls look right now. If you try this, your hair will look like it was straight and then curled-with no frizz or anything. It's cheap and not very complicated!<br>  1) Start with wet hair (I wash mine with Garnier Fructis Hydra-Curls Shampoo and Conditioner---works great =D).<br>  2) Take a LOT of Sunsilk Captivating Curls De-frizz Leave in Creme in your hand and put it all over your hair...comb it through.<br>  3) Put your hair in a tight, neat, low bun until your hair is damp (not too dry).<br>  4) Now, I know you said you don't like Herbal Essences Shampoo, I hate it too, it makes your hair feel gross. I use the Totally Twisted Curl Scrunching Gel. <br>  So, after you take your hair out of the bun, it should still be pretty wet and easy to handle, or this won't work. take the GEL and put it all over your head, from roots to tips...comb it out, twist curls around your finger, whatever. <br>  5)Then, put your hair in a HALF ponytail (If you leave some bangs out it will look pretty good later). Put each part of your hair (the half in the ponytail and the part left out) into a bun, so that you have two buns, one higher than the other.<br>  6) Leave the two buns in until your hair is just about dry, then take them out and leave your hair in the half ponytail until dry.<br>   I REALLY hope this works for you like it did for me...PLEASE let me know how it comes out...try it, I didn't think my curls could ever look so good.

lU8e0VQFaa	Well, that's your choice, you can take it out and let it heal and get it done properly or you can let it heal as is and deal with the pain that will last for a while. I was 16 and stupid and got mine done with a gun too, and it took a good solid year to heal and I was in pain the whole time (Even now they're more picky than my other piercings). <br>  <br>  If you want to try and heal them go ahead, but at least follow proper aftercare, which means ignoring anything they told you. First DO NOT turn the earring, there's no need, just make sure that the back isn't on too tight. Throw away whatever crap cleaning solution they gave you, it will actually cause more problems. Just use a warm sea salt soak 2-3 times a day for 10-15 minutes each (1/4 teaspoon per 8oz water, I suggest premixing a gallons worth so it's always ready). Keep hands, hair and any products far away from it. If you're planning on a hair cut in the next 12 months remember to mention it to your stylist, or they may get it caught on a comb and pull it out >.< Healing time is 8-12 months but since you went the gun route it will probably be closer to 12. Also, no pools or hot tubs for 2 months, no oceans for 1 and no changing them for at least 8 (or more).<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember to always be pierced properly in the future.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	You'll be fine.<br>  I had mine down by a gun a few years ago and haven't suffered any problems.|`|zcE2pS56aa	i had mine done by the needle but the best way to stop any infection is to get rid of any solutions they gave you and in an eggcup put a pinch of salt and then add boiling water, using a cotton bud clean around the ear, to get rid of any make-up, shampoo, gunk etc. make sure you wash your hands before touching the piercing and make sure the back isn't on too tight. rotate the earring as soon as you can without it hurting, and always clean the back of it too. ignore the fact about staying away from swimming pools, oceans etc. as long as you clean it thoroughly afterwards it will be fine. don't change it for about 6 months and when you do make sure you buy good quality earrings, not cheap ones as these cause infection. good luck xD|`|D3KzcRYMaa	i repierced mine and never had any trouble.
lU8e0VQFaa	Yes they do, there's no other way around it, tanning outside in the sun will do the same thing, just at a slower rate. You want to be tan? Just pick up a good fake tanner, they won't streak and won't leave you orange.|`|F89MNQheaa	They have the same harmful rays as the sun. The reason you get wrinkly is because when you tan/burn you are drying your skin out and basically you are cooking it.|`|vtW3qPZmaa	As with any UV exposure, yes it increases your chance of skin cancer and will expedite skin ageing.  Basically a tanning bed is a higher concentration of UV light than being out in regular sunlight that people expose themselves to without any sort of sunscreen.  They're dangerous and play to people's vanity.|`|AA12147036	No tanning booths are not safe.I'd try a spray on tan.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restricted-Act.463583" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restr...</a>|`|ptert8E6aa	their plenty safe, just leave the raw chicken in and crank it up to "sunburn"

vJIuGhHcaa	you shouldnt get a tattoo because 95% of people regret getting tattoos.<br>  if you want quotes, you should get things like:<br>  -     The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear.<br>  -     "Being frightened is an experience you can't buy.<br>  -       Courage is not the lack of fear but the ability to face it."|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	Please no words . Your tattoo should tell the world who  u are . <br>  A picture, a theme , a reason is a good start.   It isn't up to us. !!!! <br>  The time will come one day when you will express yourself. <br>  Being individual comes with being a grown man . Now is not <br>  the right time. LOL father of 3 daughters.|`|8THz1sp9aa	You can always look up quotes. Really think about things you have gone through etc. Just make sure you find something that holds a lot of meaning to you. <br>  <br>  'True Love Never Dies'<br>  'Love Kills'<br>  'Death Before Dishonor'<br>  'Stay True'<br>  'Hold Fast'|`|H3PcFertaa	You kind of got this backwards. You should have and image or a quote that you want, that you identify with, that is important to you, that has great meaning to you, something that you love. A quote from a favorite poem or book, that you like 1st, then decide to have it tattooed.<br>  You are wanting a 'look' more than the content. <br>  It isn't that this is a bad idea, but I think that you should wait, and ask yourself 'why' you want a word tattoo on your ribs? Don't get it because you think that they look 'cool' or 'hot' or whatever. Don't get something that you kind of like that someone else found and presented to you, just to get a word tattoo on your ribs.<br>  If you want this about being an individual, it might be counter productive to ask others (who you don't even know) to think of it for you.<br>  Don't you have books, novels, authors, poems, sayings, something your grandma said, .. something that you tell yourself, ... something that comes from you in some manner? And why do you say 'fear quotes'? You are vague, and all over the place, because you may be thinking of this as more of a fashion statement, and/or because you are growing up and thinking of being independent, then because you know what you want.<br>  You seem excited, and it makes me wonder if this is for your 18th birthday. At any rate, you need to be very careful about quotes, sayings, words that you get tattooed. You need to hold back to think it through, see how the meanings change over time, and do you still want those words a year from now, let alone 10 or 20 or more years.<br>  And usually, less is best. <br>  Take your time, there is no hurry, and good luck~|`|RIcMWeSKaa	If you don't know what you want to have written on your body forever, tough luck.<br>  You will know the saying when you see it.<br>  <br>  Google it, Ed Hardy has cool sayings too, like "Love Kills Slowly" and such.|`|FxBcccS6aa	Im like a bird<br>  I always fly away<br>  -Nelly Furtado<br>  <br>  She shines brighter than all the stars.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	My favorite is "To thine own self be true." Good daily reminder to be true to yourself.|`|YCyLuKZKaa	Well it kind of depends on the eperson you are becuase you want and quote about being an individual then maybe you should find your own quote or even make up ur own quote which would be even more original<br>  good luck but here are a few anyway.<br>        “Hunger, love, pain, fear are some of those inner forces which rule the individual's instinct for self preservation.”<br>  <br>  “The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.”|`|p3YD7qzvaa	"Carpe Diem"<br>  <br>  "Truth is beautiful, without doubt; but so are lies."<br>  <br>  "Knowledge speaks; wisdom listens."<br>  <br>  "If you rest, you rust."<br>  <br>  "Boredom's not a burden anyone should bear."<br>  <br>  "Rest your trigger on my finger."<br>  <br>  "My body is a temple."<br>  <br>  "Live fast, die pretty, crash and burn."<br>  <br>  "Family"<br>  <br>  "Mi Familia."<br>  <br>  "Money talks, bullshit walks."<br>  <br>  "Cry me a river."<br>  <br>  "I'm gonna buy a gun and start a war,<br>  If you can show me something worth fighting for."<br>  <br>  "Blood, sweat, and tears."<br>  <br>  "Shepards we shall be, for thee my Lord for thee.

7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Yeah they have em.  But they dont look like plugs really.  More like normal earrings at that size.  You might wanna upgrade before you put in plugs.|`|8THz1sp9aa	It concerns me that you don't know how to get the rings out. Why exactly do you ask this? are they cbr's? if so you just pop the little bead out and then slide the jewelry on out. If these are newly pierced or stretched I would keep the jewelry you have in for about a month. They do sell 10g plugs but make sure you use stainless steel or titanium only. other materials are very bad for your ears (why they are mostly so cheap in price) <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=3882" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai...</a><br>  <br>  and if you have sensitive skin (such as myself) you probably won't beable to use the black o rings that keep most plugs from falling out. i usually use flesh tunnels that screw on or double flare. like these:<br>  <a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=883" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetails.asp?ProductID=1404" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodyartforms.com/productdetai...</a>|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Yeah, I've seen 10g plugs.<br>  <br>  How in the world did you get your rings in if you can't get them out?  What kind of rings are they?<br>  <br>  Well then go back to your piercer to get them taken off.  If it hasn't been long since you had your ears pierced, I would hold off another two or three months before changing jewelry.

TjPwxbuJaa	OK, I have large stretched ears (1 1/2 inches = 38mm), so I have a lot of experience with this. I wouldn't recommend wearing the taper for any period of time.  A taper is meant to be used to help you get from one size to the next, not to wear. Therefore, you should put a (non-flared) tunnel in following the taper. However, your ear should not bleed during the stretching process. If it does, you are stretching too quickly. The ear lobe needs time to create new skin and tissue. A stretch from 5.5 to 8mm is bit much as well. At these sizes, about a mm at a time is better.|`|8THz1sp9aa	Honestly you really need to have patience when stretching. The best thing for you to do (since you are bleeding) is downsize. Take the taper out and put your old plugs back in. If you really have no patience then you can push the tunnel through but if you end up with a blowout it's no one's fault but your own. Make sure you do religious sea salt soaks every morning and night. Keep your hands away from your lobes at all times to prevent infection. Next time wait about 1/2 months before you stretch, and only stretch ONE size up! <br>  <br>  Also buy some vit. e oil and do vit. e oil rubs every night before you go to bed, it will help with the ear cheese smell and it'll break down the scar tissue so it's easier to stretch in the future.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Holy crap your ears should never bleed while stretching.<br>  <br>  Take your taper out, put in a 5.5mm tunnel or whatever and take care of your ears.  Sea salt soaks twice a day, after a couple of weeks you should massage your ears once a day with vitamin e oil.  Holy jesus man, you've really torn your ears.  You're going to end up with thinned out lobes, and you might even end up with rotting lobes.

I would go with a medium brown to start out so it won't be too dark.  If you don't end up liking the color then wash it out with dish soap asap.|`|0f6mGogcaa	I don't like the blonde at all, I think you should go dark, or at least a light brown with (a prettier blonde color) highlights. <br>  <br>  You hair looks orange and its not very pretty!

7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	Highlights will damage the hair because it's a bleaching process. There should be instructions on the box, but the longer you leave the bleach in, the lighter the highlights. If you have a Sally's beauty supply near you, go there because they know the products and will be able to help you.

28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	Waxing is by far the easiest way. You can get a Wax Kit made especially for your face [Nair makes the one I buy]. It has precut prewaxed strips that you just stick on and rip off. It costs about $6 a box, and each box lasts up to 6 months, depending on how often you need to wax.|`|f36589e6e79860b7c91907c99e22a735aa	Go to your local nail salon, they will wax it for $10 or so.|`|pD5rvAKSaa	Going to the electrolysis is the only permanent way of getting hair removed (although it can be a tad expensive - $20 for a 15 minute session about once a week over the course of 1-3 years) <br>  It does hurt a bit (but then again, I have terribly sensitive skin, so perhaps that's just me) but all in all i'd say It's definitely worth it. My mom had it done when she was my age as well (19) and hers never grew back. <br>  <br>  Good luck :D <br>  <br>  -- oh, and if that isn't an option, I would recommend using bleach - and perhaps pulling out the most noticeable hairs with tweezers, that's what I always did... shaving it is probably not a good idea.|`|9c27503b79201fde467bfe0f1ef26915aa	Waxing is pretty good.

TFYlv3bxaa	I work in an office environment.  I have about 8 tat's, most you cannot see, but a few (even small ones) you can, people DO judge you by what they can see.  Alot of office people find it very unprofessionall to have large tatoos.  Think realy hard about what you are doing.

Work them through your hair while it's wet and then blow dry it with a paddle brush.|`|yVM6lIjmaa	Use a straightner ^^;;|`|AJH7TiAmaa	1. Use a flat iron.

For your kinda-sorta short-ish hair, if you go to 'Sally's Beauty Supply' , They usually have mini-straightners there. And, they may be a tad expensive at around 30 bucks, but it is well worth it.<br>  <br>  The reason why it is straight, is because the water weighs it down. And, whatever you do, NEVER straighten your hair when it is wet, or even damp.

5v1c50Ybaa	NO. Get it done professionally, because i naturally have dark brown hair too, and it totally messes up! Your hair turns a orangish color, and for the first week looks like a halloween wig! A professional will not mess this up, and if it doesn't work then, ask them to strip your hair after about 6-8 weeks, but this can damage your hair badly, but just buy conditioners and shampoos to repair it!
KwNpyp3saa	These are good products for you. You don't have to use all of these. Just shampoo and conditioner. <br>  <br>  Side note: If you got your hair colored anywhere in the red family, these colors fade faster than any other color. Good luck!
PeNTl6KOaa	Let's get started with these helpful tips.<br>  <br>  Wet hair is much easier to cut than dry hair. Start with freshly shampooed, tangle-free hair. Keep a bottle of water with a spray nozzle nearby so that you can dampen your hair if it begins to dry while you are working on it.<br>  Be sure that your scissors are nice and sharp to avoid pulling your hair. If you plan to cut your hair on a regular basis, it will be worth investing in a good quality pair of scissors designed specifically for use on hair.<br>  No matter what style you choose, cut a little at a time, especially if you are a beginner. You can always cut it a little shorter, but once you've gone too short, all you can do is wait for it to grow back!<br>  Simple styles are best for home hair cuts. The easiest cut will be one length everywhere. Decide on an overall length (it's a good idea to measure your hair when you have a cut that you find especially flattering) and then grab your ruler. Working in small sections, comb your hair straight out from your scalp and hold a section smoothly between your index and middle fingers. Measure to the desired length and carefully snip off the excess. Continue in this manner until you have cut all of your hair. This method works equally well for both men and women. The length of the chosen cut can vary from quite short to shoulder length and beyond. Do you have dry scalp and dandruff, or do you dream of regrowing hair? I recommend you strengthen the hair you have and regrow what you've lost using this ancient Indian remedy, known simply as the Herbal Hair Solution<br>  You may want to start with a professional cut and then just trim about the same amount of hair from all areas of your head every month or two to maintain the style. Be aware that on most people, the hair on one side of their head grows faster than on the other, so if you choose this method, you will need to visit your stylist every now and then as the cut begins to get uneven. Another idea for a simple, yet attractive cut is to lean over and comb all of your wet hair straight forward. Smooth sections of your hair through your fingers and cut all hair in one straight line across. Be sure to work in small sections and continue from one side to the other. Double check to see that the cut feels pretty even and then stand upright. Part your hair in the middle and comb it straight down. Run small sections of your hair between your index and middle fingers to see if there are any long pieces. If you find some, carefully snip off the excess.<br>  If you have curly hair, be sure to cut your hair considerably longer than the desired finished length. Curls shrink up quite a bit as they dry, so you must allow for this. If your hair is very thick or coarse, hold very small sections of hair for trimming. Trying to cut too much hair at once, especially for thick hair, can make the hair bend between the blades of the scissors, instead of cutting evenly.<br>  For all styles, when you think that you are finished, be sure to check that the cut feels even everywhere. Simply take sections of hair from opposite sides of your head and gently tug them toward your eyes, nose, chin and jaw line to see that the sides are fairly evenly matched. Carefully trim prices that seem a little too long.<br>  For bangs, begin with your hair parted in the center. Using your comb, take an equal amount of hair from each side of the part line and comb it forward. Smooth the hair between your index and middle fingers and cut across, being careful to maintain a straight line.<br>  Currently, many men are choosing to wear their hair "buzzed" or cut extremely short. This cut can be easily achieved at home by using an electric hair clipper. These lightweight clippers allow you to set the blades to your desired length, ranging from completely bald to several inches of hair. By simply running the clipper across your head repeatedly, you will clip all hair to the desired length. For the easiest men's haircut of all, simply lather up with a thick shaving cream and shave your head smooth. This look is especially favored by athletes.<br>  One word of caution--keep it simple. If you are inexperienced at cutting your own hair and looking for a complicated style with many angles or layers, you will probably need to enlist the help of a friend to be sure that your haircut is even in areas that are difficult for you to reach. Dating Blogs.<br>  As you get more comfortable cutting your own hair, you may want to attempt more complicated styles. There are a number of terrific books and videos available that offer step-by-step guidance. A video can be especially helpful since you get to see the procedure in action and can replay it as many times as necessary to help you fine-tune your skills.<br>  <br>  Hope this has helped. Enjoy :)<br>  <br>  xx|`|hMMU02iuaa	I think you should go to a different hairdresser. DO NOT take a chance at doing it yourself. You are likely to mess it up. Cutting hair should be done by professionals. That is why you see so many people with messed up hair and when you ask them about it, they say they cut it themselves.|`|YnEKOJayaa	do it<br>  <br>  i often cuttt my own<br>  <br>  and i like it better than the hairdressers could do|`|B7abZOTJaa	Scissors,Mirror, comb and Good Luck.|`|C3sqTngtaa	itsreally not worth it love, you will end up making a mess of it.... cant you go to another hairdresser?|`|bvUMwDgyaa	First, I suggest getting a inexpensive hair cutting kit from a place like Target, or Walmart. Usually you can find these kits in the area with straighteners and hairdryers. In this kit you'll find the specially designed hair cutting scissors which won't ruin your hair like kitchen scissors or papers scissors would. Cut your hair when its wet, to avoid any mistakes or accidental mishaps. Dry and style, and if you still need to patch up a few hairs give it a trim. Also, if didn't make much sense and you still need help, the haircutting kit usually tells you alot about cutting your own hair.|`|HQlFZpbuaa	i would try a different hair dresser, you are not a prefessional and yeah, your hair might be different from everyone else's but it might not be in a good way, so print out some pictures of hairstyles you would like and take them to your new hairdresser and see how it goes, i just am afraid it wont turn out how you like!|`|lEAvhDheaa	if you don't mind the "different look" option can cause you to heard not positive comments from people around you, go ahead.

From experience id say you'd be better off getting someone else to do it.

You can't do it yourself because you can't see or reach the back properly, so ask your mum.  Cut tiny bits at a time, so if there is any mistake it isn't noticeable!
M7Cdycxpaa	omg dont force your children into doing something that is so materialistic and that only being pretty etc...matters in life when you should focus on the childs education as a future employer is not going to look at how many beauty pageants they have won but their school results and their intellectual ability!!! i just dont understand all of these pageants!! i live in ireland and completely disagree with all these pageants in america and the children in them look really unnatural!!|`|QWTLw9DEaa	well, I can't help you with information on it...<br>  But please don't put your children into these pageants.

XaYHMNusaa	Eyebrow piercings, navel piercings, and surface piercings.  Eyebrows and navels are notorious for rejecting and migrating but I think, if they get placed perfectly on someone, they could last.  I've had my navel for 3+ years.   And surface piercings usually don't last b/c not many people know how to perform them correctly, they use the wrong jewelry, and/or they're placed on an awkward part of the body [somewhere w/ a lot of movement, somewhere that doesn't get much ventilation, etc.].  Just go to a reputable, experience piercer and you'll have less risk of problems  :]   And do the correct aftercare.|`|dHkvVlONaa	I have heard that eyebrow and belly button piercings almost always reject, even if it isn't for like years, they always seem to reject or migrate.<br>  <br>  My belly button piercing rejected the first time, so i got it re-done and it migrated a little bit, but now it seems to be fine.<br>  <br>  But personally I think that ALL surface piercings have the highest rejection rate, especially like the hip surface piercings and stuff.<br>  <br>  if you want a surface piercing like belly button, eye brow or anything else that they normally put a surface bar through, you can still get it just get it done with mircodermals instead because they have way less chance for rejection and heal faster.<br>  <br>  But piercings that have very low rejection rate would be like:<br>  any ear piercings<br>  lip <br>  nose<br>  tongue<br>  andd those kind of piercings.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|IuIp7Eevaa	eyebrow piercings always migrate out no matter what after a period of time, also nape, clavicle, anti-eyebrow and other surface piercings like that.

vwoqIUR6aa	normally takes about 6 weeks to grow back,sometimes 4. you can take some advil or something before you go. I think it jhurts more doing it yourself than having someone else do it. It grows back finer. what ever you do-don't go around your period|`|LZzsDARUaa	any time u want, it ides at 1st sessions, but then ir ur hair roots burn out and u don't feel pain or u will get used 2 it. It really depends how good the person doing it is. If she/he can do it with less strokes, as in taking of the wax then it's less pain<br>  <br>  and as it will burn ur roots it will make the hair grow back slower and lighter|`|DsNEpN95aa	You can get your legs waxed any time, just make sure the hair is longer than 1/4 inch. It might hurt for the first time, but after that, you'll get more used to it. Some people really can't stand it, but others think it's not that bad, so it also depends on your skin type. <br>  <br>  It's definitely worth it, because since it pulls the hair out from the root, it slows down the hair growth cycle. Whereas, shaving just gets rid of the hair on the surface, but it grows out within a few days. Waxing makes the hair growth slower and it makes the hair thinner as well.|`|RsC1az2Gaa	If you have hair that is appearing and starting to make you feel embarassed ( no skirts etc...) then you should go for it.<br>  The first time will hurt you but waxing will make your hair grow out slowly ( about a month) and it will be soft.<br>  Shaving wont hurt but it will be like a beard with time lol and waxing makes your hair less with time:)|`|KBkTDOZUaa	Till you're ready. I'm not gonna lie it hurts a lot. But it is definitely worth it and if you continue consistently, after a while it doesn't grow back again apparently. And no it doesn't grow back longer or faster, however don't wax away blonde hairs because they do grow back darker. Good luck|`|52bb38389ace91aedab5837d20eb5996aa	i dont think its worth it at all. just shave. how ever brazillians are completely worth it|`|kIOVadeTaa	i think u shuld wait until the spring so they will be looking sexy 4 the summer and u can show them off
VN2wyTnFaa	You'll really need something like rice powder to absorb the oil because there aren't any mascaras out there that are oil proof. Waterproof is the best that you'll get because the strongest makeup removers contain oil because they need something to get them off. Definitely try some rice powder or some blotting powder. Good luck!|`|X36cVh4faa	you don't need to get new mascara, just put some loose powder under your eyes to absorb the oil and keep it from running.|`|f6rHiAe2aa	This person on this link can help; she has a lot of reviews.<br>  Check it out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/MakeupGeekTV" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/MakeupGeekTV</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped!
o5g5qBOFaa	Ahh<br>  they only hate A & F and Hollister because its more exspensive and aero isnt that exspensive|`|H0BrZ1Goaa	No, I think Aero is NAWT the same category as Abercrombie or Hollister.<br>  <br>  Aero clothes are ALOT bigger and they have extra larges and fat ppl <br>  can so totally fit in it.<br>  <br>  Plus aero is like $10 cheaper then evrything in abercrombie/hollister<br>  <br>  But preppy ppl still wear it but not alot and evrything in aero is all graphics! They rarely have any cute shirts (beside polos) ALSO they dont have alot of LOGO stuff but evrything always has aeropostale on it! and THAT is why AERO is cheap wannbe-abercrombie/hollsiter and sorta preppy for people who cant really afford abercrombie/hollister OR because they dont fit.|`|fnogJGNoaa	Same category: for the popular preps.|`|jrW8wtRRaa	The ppl that hate them just don't have the money and are not thin enough to wear the clothes|`|N49HTaF6aa	I love all three!!!!!! But aeropostale is a few levels down in quality.|`|XOMX2pEqaa	i love all those stores....but i do put them in the same category|`|ubk21UBvaa	no, aero isnt as preppy and prep-school.<br>  <br>  plus its cheaper and not everything has the brand name written across the chest|`|KWl605JTaa	people usually don't like aero just because it's not as expensive as hollister and a&f.<br>  <br>  aero may not have as cute stuff but they are same fit and what not. and not to mention a lot cheaper.|`|t2sRfYgPaa	Yes. Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister are owned by the same company, that's why they are sometimes put in a different category, but many of the clothes at Aeropostale and the other two stores are very similar.|`|GykCnbR7aa	no i really don't i wear those brands too they're clothes are not really similar to me  i can't explain it but the clothes don't look the same so i don't put it in the same category but those are some of my favorite stores|`|uCsu1VYgaa	Oh people hate areopostale, for some other reasons, it's terribly cheap and unflattering. <br>  however one could say the same about hollister and abercrombie as welll....|`|hfGE5jieaa	Abercrombie and Fitch.<br>  Hollister.<br>  Aeropostale.<br>  <br>  Now, you tell me.<br>  Which one of these does not belong?
fSn4KSuPaa	i have the same exact hair. <br>  <br>  what you NEED to do is rub lots of shampoo in your bangs, the top of your head, and the hair closer to your head, and only a little tiny bit of conditioner in those areas. put more conditioner in the parts where your hair is frizzy. <br>  <br>  also the kind of shampoo + conditioner you use contributes a LOT to the way your hair is. the better the shampoo, the better your bangs, and conditioner the same with the rest of your hair. <br>  <br>  if you use suave, that is not a good one for hair like yours. use pantene or garnier and find one that especially treats fizzy hair. <br>  <br>  what i do to calm the frizz down it use john frieda frizz-ease hair serum- <a href="http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/products.asp?pid=94&section=products&subSection=frizzEase&lineID=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.johnfrieda.com/products/produ...</a><br>  also, dont fiddle with your bangs to much because that makes them more oily. also, to make it less frizzy you should use a ceramic hair straigtener to straighten, or flatten the frizz. <br>  <br>  hope i helped! :D|`|d8OwsZC2aa	get some frizz cream|`|8vIh7iewaa	If you style your hair like this :<br>  <a href="http://i214.photobucket.com/albums/cc200/Zom-bee/more%20scene%20hair/2584780298_0b0a5652aa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i214.photobucket.com/albums/cc200...</a><br>  you wont have a problem with it looking bad
btWTd7yvaa	A similar situation happened to me, and I was like AHHHH, but then I found out that if you have black eyeshadow on you, or very dark eyeshadow (or any colour you want), just apply the eyeshadow to either a cotton bud or the normal eyeshadow applicator and do what you would to with the eyeliner! I do this and I've completely abandoned my eyeliner - I think eyeshadow is much better!!<br>  Hope I Helped ;)<br>  Bonnie x|`|hQA8Ql21aa	Put a little black eyeshadow on bottom?|`|RiStkJT9aa	instead of making it dark put the eyeliner penicil but if its liquid it would be better but put the eyeliner in mascara and used that then wipe off the excess mascara on the eyeliner
rJtFSDxkaa	this is normal , I'm not much of a tube top girl but i really like them...during the summer i wore one without shirt, turned out okay but preferred to wear it with a shirt under, that's what i did at school cause of dress code. or find like a sweater...there like about half way down your torso(i don't remember what they're called) and put that over :) good luck hope i helped :)|`|fSn4KSuPaa	depends- if it were more on the really fancy side then yes it would look out of place. but if its simple like <a href="http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3477388&cp=&sr=1&kw=tube&origkw=tube&parentPage=search&searchId=" rel="nofollow">http://www.charlotterusse.com/product/in...</a> then maybe if it were tight, not exactly spandex, and not baggy.|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	If you're asking if wearing a t-shirt under a tube top would look weird, yea. Although, you could wear a wife-beater under a baby-doll tube top. but why don't you just let your bra straps show with your tube top?|`|ZnDK3dHIaa	Clear bra straps!
oj8oCNzGaa	bendy curlers, they look like wiggly worms...u wrap them up to help create loose curls or a tussled effect, plus a little serum for the fly away bits!<br>  or u could plat hair the night before?|`|jplsgmpoaa	use a hair clip (medium size) and loosely clip back some of the top layer - it looks good on curly hair :) x|`|VykkX7TEaa	Dampen it then scrunch it up with moose
gf4X8FOnaa	I have one too!<br>  I put vaseline on it and its gotten better and I always slather lotion on it. And I also rub it with a toe shrubber like to rub off callouses with (I know but I only rub it on the spot and I do so rather gently) and its almost gone.
LGkp7isUaa	It's very stupid. But unfortunately, we live in a world where looks will determine business. If you have tattoos, dreads, nappy hair, you'll be less likely to be looked at for a position... regardless of your skill level & ability. <br>  Not saying it's fair, but it's just how it is. If you want a good, or great job, you gotta roll with the rules thrown out at ya.|`|AA12370001	regardless of what you think, the place you are working makes the rules and if you don't follow them, you can't work there.<br>  <br>  Whether you want to believe it or not but the majority of people dislike tattoos and think differently of people who have them.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	When you deal with the public at any level then I think employers are well within their rights to ban visible ink - it is effectively the public making the rules, not the employer - it is an unfortunate but true fact that there are many members of society who will be less inclined to use their service if they are dealing with somebody who is tattooed. The employer is running a business and compassion doesn't come into it - it is his job to make decisions that will be most beneficial to the success of his business.<br>  <br>  For jobs that don't deal with the public at all - then it is simply about professionality. This, I don't agree with so much. There is nothing in a tattoo to say that a person is less capable of doing a job, and if there is no chance that anybody paying money into the business will see you and potentially be put off - then there is little other logical reason for it. But some employers, even in private offices away from the eyes of everyone else, want to maintain a professional image, and tattoos don't come under the cloak of professionalism as far as they are concerned. Others will actively discriminate against the tattoos and see you as a rebel or a thug and not want you on their payroll.<br>  <br>  The short answer is it's all about discrimination at some level - whether it's the public or the employer. But things are changing slowly and, while I doubt there'll be a change in our own lifetimes, in a few generation's time I think things will be much different. One day hopefully tattoos will be up there on the list with age, sex and race of things illegal to discriminate against.|`|g3IXprk9aa	Because it's not all the way accepted in society yet.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of older generations that still frown upon it and don't understand it. If you aren't someone that is a tattoo enthusiast then it can be hard to understand why people want to get tattooed and have something on their body forever, or why they want to "mark" their body up.<br>  <br>  Also, religion can come into play as well. It can be offensive, and some religions aren't allowed to have tattoo. So there is really many different reasons why you can't always get a job and have a tattoo.<br>  <br>  The upside though is that more and more people are now getting tattoos and it is getting more accepted. It's not so looked down upon as it used to be. Meaning, for our kids generation and their kids, I'm sure it will be accepted by then. And some jobs don't mind as long as you can cover it up, some even let you expose some of them. So there is a plus and negative side to this all.|`|ZlfPl6B1aa	tattoos are often looked down upon by the professional community..<br>  <br>  yes, it's stupid..esp if your tattoo isn't offensive! <br>  if you have a naked woman on your neck, then yeah, you aren't going to get that professional job..<br>  <br>  just like plain white walls that aren't marred up with scratches..companies often think of their employees as an extension of themselves..and if your sporting a logo they don't like, then your not going to get hired.<br>  <br>  just keep your tattoos hidden. I have eight. You can only see one of mine bc it's on my wrist and I could cover if needed, but most places don't care bc it's a small script name. <br>  <br>  it sucks but thats corporate america!|`|LIxpXTnLaa	Because most people with tattoos share your intellectual bandwidth.|`|L2dxBXQRaa	For some reason body art can be frowned upon. x|`|s0lcBI5baa	Tattoo hatred goes back as far as one can remember. In Corporate America, it is frowned upon because the employees are the face of the company. When you have someone with tattoos all over them, it shows everyone how the company is. Older people know tattoos as kids that are trouble makers, or gang members. But now-a-days, it is getting more and more accepted. I have tattoos myself, and work in huge corporation. Everyday when I work, I must cover up my tattoos, but on some days they tend to show a little, and the customers tend to discus with me abut them, and they tend to like it more often than not. Which has led my manager to not be so strict on it.<br>  <br>  So give it time, and I am sure they will be accepted more. But if you have tattoos, you must know that it does effect getting a job in more places, cause of the rules. Be prepared to cover them up and get treated differently. But stay true to yourself, and do as you please, just take their criticism with a grain of salt.|`|i0SyPs0iaa	because supposedly its unprofessional..its dumb but some people are threatened and scared by people with tattoos so they arent hired just so that business isn't ruined|`|eOiAfudfaa	some employers are just to close-minded|`|IBnt3W0Yaa	well you might think its "cool" but they think its a gang symbol

Take some bobby pins and take some hair to sides .<br>  <br>  Examples :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii55/nudraat/207-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii55/...</a> <br>  (thats me.)<br>  <br>  and ...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i410.photobucket.com/albums/pp190/FindStuff2/Music/Katy%20Perry/katy55.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i410.photobucket.com/albums/pp190...</a> <br>  And katy perry's hair how she has her hair pinned to her sides to emphasize her bangs .<br>  <br>  hope this helps <3|`|Vge3KBaMaa	dry your hair

As for the dark circles, there are a lot of products that claim to reduce or remove them, but I haven't had much luck finding anything that works. My best solution is a good quality concealer to cover them. Bare Minerals is supposedly an excellent concealer, but I haven't tried it yet. I'm currently using either Clinique or Physician's Formula. They both work fairly well.|`|xv3opX9Maa	drink tons of water and your skin will glow<br>  dont drink any soda or carbonated beverages because it makes your skin really dull<br>  and get something like this<br>  <a href="http://www.olay.com/images/product/detail/re1010de.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.olay.com/images/product/detai...</a><br>  its a targetted tone enahncer and i love it ... its about 18 dollars but its worth it. just put it all over your face and it even kinda helps with dark circles <br>  and it really brightned my face alot <br>  ( =|`|2qPtGTNcaa	The best way to get glowing skin is to eat green and red vegetables and drink 8 glasses of water a day.

vXR5L8Jfaa	First off, you're right, it's called the waterline. <br>  And second off, well, you can, but it is not advised. From my own personal experience, I didn't know you weren't supposed to use liquid eyeliner on the water, so I ended up doing it and it felt as thought I was literally burning my eye. It took so much scrubbing to get it off too since it seemed to be pretty tough liquid eyeliner. The next day it was irritated and a little puffy and hurt like heck! If I were you, I would stick with a nice pencil for the bottom and I'm sure if you look around you'll be able to find one that is creamy enough to go on smooth but won't actually irritate the waterline and hurt your eye.<br>  <br>  ?MB|`|HHnQyjFBaa	NO, you definitely cannot put liquid liner on the water line.

It is really terrible for your eyes. I've hear about this from a really great makeup guru. Stick with liquid liner for your top lash line. If you must line your waterline, stick with a creamy pencil. Also, why would you put something on your eyes that hurts??<br>  Hope this helps :)|`|REAd52Nlaa	You can but... I did it the other day and my eye hurts sooo bad!

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Are you natural or relaxed? You might have better luck growing your hair long in its natural state, and if you want it straight then you can use a flat iron - the both of best worlds = naturally curly one day and straight the next. <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with what you do to it now. I actually think the combination of oils will help keep your hair healthy. I do hot oil treatments with extra virgin olive oil before I cleanse my hair and this helps keep it healthy and strong. I used to do this every time I washed my hair (1-3 times a week), but I stopped for like two weeks and I noticed my curls began to loose elasticity (the ability to bounce back into its natural state), so I began doing hot oil treatments again. One thing about your natural oil mix, try warming it up and turning it into a hot oil treatment and your hair might fair better. Another thing, use a daily moisturizer, if you're not. Many people mistake oils for moisturizers, but oils are generally used to seal in moisture and they are not a moisturizer. For daily moisturizers I use Neutrogena triple moisture and Nexxus daily moisturizers. Currently I use Giovanni Direct leave-in because I do a lot of "wash n go" with my hair. During the summer start using a moisturizer with a humectant (spelling is off) because this will draw the moisture from the air and into your hair and will help keep it moisturized. Nexxus has humectant moisturizers. You can also go to a store and buy vegetable glycerine because this is a natural humectant and you can mix it with your other hair products. Sometimes (only during the summer) the only thing I need for my hair is water (moisturizer), glycerine, and a natural oil (olive oil) to seal. <br>  <br>  Make sure you do a good deep conditioner at least once a month; I do mine 1-2 times a week. I'm natural, but before this I used to be relaxed for 13 years. I had hair passed my shoulder in the front and in the back it was down my back, but with constant breakage it kept getting shorter (which is one of the reasons I went natural). One thing I noticed about my breakage was that my hair would grow longer but as soon as I started combing and brushing it it would break off and I would loose the length I had gained. I eventually learned through a lot of research that blacks have the most fragil hair out of any race and it EASILY breaks off due to rough combing, brushing, styling, and using a lot of heat. <br>  <br>  I stopped using heat when I got heat damage and it broke off a lot my hair and gave me a tons of split ends. I also learned about the proper use of a heat protectant which I wasn't using and helped contribute to a lot of the severe breakage. I also noticed that every time I grew a bang down to my eyebrows (LOVED my bangs) it would always break off to less than one inch of hair. Again, through my research I learned the breakage was due to the way I brushed my hair and the type of brush I used (boar bristle and rough brushing). <br>  <br>  Have you considered asking your family for hair advice since they have long hair? The key to having long hair is to focus on length retention. The ends of your hair is the oldest parts - it has been through EVERY thing you've put your hair though (dyes, split ends, chemicals, heat, etc) and it is the driest parts of your hair as well as the most fragile - when your hair breaks off it breaks off at the ends, not the roots. You have to focus on treating with tender loving care those ends and make sure they get plenty of moisture so they don't dry out and break off. <br>  <br>  On average, hair grows 1/2 inch per month, or 6 inches per year. Hair growth is pre-determined by genetics and nothing can change this. Your hair might grow faster or slower than average, but most people will probably fall into the average - I'm one of them. You've also noticed the truthfulness of this because you've mentioned that none of the products for instant hair growth has worked for you. These are all marketing ploys by companies who prey on people who desperately want long hair, and these "miracle" forumlas do not work. <br>  <br>  I got my hair cut last summer in order to go back to my natural hair. I cut my hair from past shoulder-length to less than one inch. Six months later I had hair past my ear and it's still growing. My hair seems like it's growing "faster," but in reality it's actually been growing the same as it always has. The difference is that I'm retaining more length/growth by keeping my breakage to a minimum. My hair isn't breaking off so I've retained every bit of hair that has grown within those 6 months. If I keep doing this then I estimate that I should have shoulder-length hair one year after I got it cut. The key to hanging on to all my growth is by cutting down on the daily styling. I don't comb and brush my hair everyday, and when I do "comb" I will use my fingers to get out a lot of the shed hair and some of the tangles (my hair is curly and tangles, but it doesn't form knots and is easy to detangle). I untangled my hair fully for the first time recently with a comb and went though my hair peice-by-peice to get out the tangles  and I had absolutely no breakage. This could be because my hair is generally healthy and the hot oil treatments have made it stronger. <br>  <br>  Okay, enough about my long hair sermon, lol. Cut down on how much daily styling you do with your hair. If you can, use your fingers to style your hair and get out the kinks. If you must use a comb then use a wide-tooth comb to comb your hair - beleive me, you'll cut down on breakage this way. When you wash your hair ALWAYS detangle when your hair is wet and has conditioner in it; this will make it easier to detangle and it will cut down on breakage from the tangles. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bRcwqYhiaa	massage your hair in a circular motion from the top of your head n use some kind of hair oil and keep it in for the night and wash it out in the morning, do this every week atleast,oil is like food for the hair and needs it to grow n stay healthy you could massage ur head daily if you want. try it this should help x|`|sh9rQ5unaa	tea tree shampoo and conditioner :) x|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	tea tree shampoo and conditioner just makes the hair and scalp very clean, its a good way to clarify the hair. our hair tends to be dry so first i would say is too wash and deep condition at lease once a week and moisturize daily. hair growth will not come if you do not take proper care of your hair in the first place. for our hair its health first then length follows<br>  <br>  here are some sites that well help you on your hair journey<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://keepitsimplesista.ning.com" rel="nofollow">http://keepitsimplesista.ning.com</a><br>  <a href="http://forum.blackhairmedia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://forum.blackhairmedia.com/</a><br>  <br>  good luck

S39tjYvcaa	Well:<br>  1. To get a haircut your hair has to be wet, so why not shampoo it while you're at it?<br>  <br>  2.

They have been working and they have dirty, sweaty hair.<br>  2. The client asks for me to wash it because they enjoy it.<br>  3. Dry hair will dull my scissors.<br>  4. Wet hair is easier to cut.<br>  5. Dry hair will fly all over the place, so I will wet it.<br>  6. I will wash your hair after your haircut to wash out all the loose hair.<br>  <br>  I have a few customers that wash their own hair before they come.  Several clients will wash their hair  that morning and they won't need their hair washed again.  In that circumstance, I will mist their hair with a spray bottle.|`|vAhpjdNJaa	it's just so that they can style your hair.<br>  hairstylists like to work with wet hair to cut it. but they wouldn't wet your hair without shampooing it because your hair would be too dry.<br>  don't complain though... don't you love getting your head massaged when they rub the shampoo on your head?|`|42uWWzubaa	sometimes people come into the salon with product in their hair like hair spray and mousse. It makes the hair clump together. They might wash it to get rid of all that chemical and they cut your hair wet. Even if you decide you dont need a wash, they will still spray water onto your hair to cut it.|`|K8qXXubdaa	its easier for them to cut it if its wet<br>  <br>  also some people are into the whole head massage thing, and it makes your hair all smooth and lush :)|`|Nupv5Uzlaa	Don't you ever notice how they cut your hair when it is WET?

If you looking for something that will attract the guys though.  You might want to wear nice looking, tight pants and a tight shirt.  A lot of guys are attracted to that kind of style.  I'm one of them.|`|fsVqGQstaa	Hey! I've been there!<br>  <br>  Ok, so first: with the makeup problem, of how you can't wear any, you should ask your mom! Specify that you won't be wearing a lot, and seriously, you shouldn't. Mostly because foundation and cover-up is bad for your skin and causes zits. If you have a zit or a blemish, it's OK to use just a bit of cover up or foundation, to "cover" it up, but make sure it's the right tone, because if it's not, it can turn out pretty weird looking without you knowing it!<br>  <br>  So before you ask your mom, suck up a bit. Just a bit. People say it's bad to suck up, but when you REALLY want something, it's good to do it just a little bit, without being too obvious. So:<br>  1) Suck up a bit! :p<br>  2) Say, "Hey Mom?" really innocently, smiling... positively!<br>  3) Say, "I know that you don't really want me to wear makeup, but is it OK if, just for the dance, I wear maybe just a little? Not a lot, I promise. Just, like, a little. ONLY for the dance. Not again, I promise! It's just that it's a really big thing and I REALLY want to look especially good." or something along those lines. Don't get mad if she says no, because later she could change her mind if you're good about it. If you freak, she'll definitely keep the rules strict.<br>  <br>  Hope THAT part helps.<br>  <br>  Now for the dress!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gracemagazine.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/clarisse-9103300.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://gracemagazine.files.wordpress.com...</a><br>  <br>  Now READ this before you freak: I'm thinking, the middle one-ish. Maybe more of a red, because brunettes look nice in red. I really like the top, where just the boob part of the dress is sort of bunched up really cute. It's a super nice look. I know something: The frills are a little funny sometimes! Maybe, to stay on the safe side, you should keep away from the frills. A dress just like that, minus the frills, and in red, would be gorgeous! Just at knee level, or a little lower. You'll need a strapless bra, though, which can be annoying, but stick it out for the dance! Pull it up a little extra high before you actually go into the dance (mom purposes, heehee), but when in the dance, let it linger a little lower. No boob cracks, but JUST higher. I think something like that would be perfect! Try to stick with the strapless. I think that's the prettiest.<br>  <br>  Now for the shoes!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.smarter.com/blogs/BEES_RED-LEATHER_zoom1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.smarter.com/blogs/BEES_RED...</a><br>  <br>  These are nice, leather-like, red (for your dress!) and with the tiny, subtle bow. The little tiny lift at the end is for walking purposes only, so don't worry! If there was no lift, it would sure be hard to walk. That's why you don't see people walking around in ballet shoes! AND DON'T YOU DARE WEAR SOCKS WITH THEM! I really might have to hunt you down if you do. Shoes are simple, but with even the simplest pair, you can be dazzling!<br>  <br>  I know you didn't specify jewelry, which is why I'm going for the very small, subtle, cheap jewelry. But here it is, in case you want it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iluvm.co.uk/acatalog/liza_925silver_necklace.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.iluvm.co.uk/acatalog/liza_925...</a><br>  <br>  That's a cute necklace to go with the dress. Make sure that the heart hangs just above the dress. If it's longer, just bunch is up at the back or something. Or shorten it. :D   THAT exact one looks expensive, I know. You can find them at cheap little stores, even dollar stores! The hearts are quiet, (Not screaming, "LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME!"). Stay away from bracelets. They sometimes get a little overdone and they get annoying! The silver is best with the red, btw.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewelrysilverworld.com/images/Anklet100-1%5B1%5D.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewelrysilverworld.com/images...</a><br>  <br>  A cute little, thin-chained anklet can make those plain flats look even special-er. Anything with a very thing chain and only a few charms or beads. It MUST be silver, as gold or bronze doesn't look as good with red. The charms should be small and few-at-a-time, because too many makes it look bulky. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml07/07210.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtm...</a><br>  <br>  Little round, silver studs are simple, subtle... cute! Really, these are the best. No gems, jewels, diamonds... just silver. It's kinda weird when people with earring holes don't wear earrings, so these are the best!<br>  <br>  HAIR!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://s304.photobucket.com/albums/nn186/uncoofbe/?action=view&current=hilary-duff-03.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s304.photobucket.com/albums/nn186...</a><br>  <br>  I don't think that that length should be curled for this exact dress and event, so I recommend something pretty and easy. First, straighten your hair. Pull it all back, leaving a few strands out in the front, and bunch it up at the back, with a clip. Preferably a red or silver clip! Let's stick to the same theme! OK. Good to go!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped. I really hope I got everything! Have fun!|`|J1kJb98Maa	<a href="http://www.zappos.com/product/7404121/color/3" rel="nofollow">http://www.zappos.com/product/7404121/co...</a><br>  super cute!|`|jUzcucmQaa	oh

I use to supply the transportation for other vendors who shipped their products into mac, so that they could relabel and resell under that name. alot of companies do that and not many people know this. The same applies for store brand food. Store brand food is 1/2 made by the stores manufacturer and 1/2 purchased from name brands but relabeled under that store brand and sold for a cheaper price. If i was able to release the vendors to you and give you an example without breaking company policy everyone here would be EXTREMELY surprised. <br>  <br>  all in all, I would buy something you might think you like, try it, if you dont then go on to the next label.|`|eH8c068yaa	I have used almost every type of makeup that you can buy at a drugstore.

JWNzoksmaa	both...at night and weekends a pad, during the my mon-fri work week tampons...only b/c it's not as..umm well messy.  But i believe it's healthy to let it "flow" ....b/c it's a cleansing process you know what i mean.  Plus my cramps aren't as bad if i don't wear the tampon at night.|`|nKwcGLQraa	tampon, but then i usually have a thin pad just incase it leaks :).<br>  <br>  tampons are really nice cause you don't feel them at all. And its much less bloody.|`|j9nhk1v2aa	I personally use a pad. As for some women, its really not for everyone. I know of one girl, hers had got lost. She had to go to an gynecologist to help get it out. And I heard of stories that it may cause toxic syndrome. Nothing's wrong with wearing one, you just have to be mindful that its there.They might have improved since then, but I rather use a pad.I hope this was much helpful.|`|NZ5pOYJFaa	I use both, but i use tampons at school. They are mostly comfortable if you put them in right. And it's okay if you've never used a tampon, a lot of people don't use them for many reasons.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Tampons are great...I use pads sometimes too but tampons are wayy better. They are a tad bit uncomfortable the first few times,but you get used to it :)|`|m9eySP2Paa	tampons are more dependable. and they last longer without having to worry about leakage.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	both. I normally wear tampons during the day and sometimes over night with a pad during heavy days but yes both|`|Klk25W7Gaa	I prefer tampons.  But occasionally they seem to make me cramp more.  At the times when I'm more crampy, I use pads.  Tampons have seemed to get a bit more uncomfortable since I had my son a year ago, but they are still what I prefer.<br>  It's not weird to have never used a tampon.  I know plenty of women who haven't used them, or just don't like them.  I tried at 14 to use one for the first time.  It hurt like hell!  I waited a few years (actually until after I had lost my virginity) to use them again.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	I prefer tampons because I dont feel like I have a nasty sticky icky diaper on my *** for a week lol. But the only ones worth it are the pearls I think they are by platex not too sure but these are great at preventing leaks.|`|cKDBwNITaa	i like tampons better because i know that nothing will show and pads are healthier kinda but wayyy less comfy. So i hope i helped you decide. good luck!|`|1JU8gJ7jaa	i like both.. i use tampons the first couple days whenit heavy.. and a pad at the end.. their both comfy to me.. its your choice|`|A8k9NHigaa	tampons are great, but maybe a pad at night to prevent tss.|`|gGSFeUWbaa	pads, and only stayfree.|`|9waLV4Miaa	pads|`|QCdpBqhHaa	Both|`|eMSP740Taa	A tampon can be comfortable if you wear one correctly and if you wear the one that is appropriate for you. If you are a virgin, you can't just wear regular tampons. They make some specifically for virgins. I personally try to stay away from tampons even though I've had children. They have been known and proven to cause vaginal cancer with constant use. I think pads are a much safer option especially for young teens and adults.|`|a2O4qDpnaa	I like pads, tampons are good for swimming and things of that sort but they scratch the inside of your vagina and really aren't very good for you plus the risk of TSS. Pads never really leak (unlike tampons) and they aren't bad for your body. Have some tampons on hand for swimming and sports and things but I prefer pads.|`|sX9StUeYaa	Both<br>  Tampon is uncomfortable the first few times and when you walk you get a bit annoyed and if your a virgin and you put it in when your dry, when you pull it out it hurts, so just remember to put it in when your um... lubricated. If you going in a pool definately use a tampons cause all sorts of accidents can happen if you use a pad in a pool.|`|RNqHL8y7aa	I used to be so afraid of tampons! until about 2 years ago, where I had to go to the beach and I was on my period and I had no other choice. You have to relax when you insert it in. it's really uncomfortable at first, but you'll get used to it. I use mostly pads, I only used tampons as my very last resort. When you use tampons make sure you change them every 4 hours to avoid toxic shock syndrome.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	tampons for out at the mall so you dont have to feel it drip down, but pads when im chillin at home<br>  <br>  its all about personal preference i guess, but tampons dont hurt at all, and if you put them in right you wont even feel them|`|CvWp7PZ2aa	i use tampons and panty liner they are like pads ony thinner and not as wide and yes tampons are a little unfomfertable but you have to insert them right youll get used to it after a while o yeah tampons last longer|`|24sK6L2uaa	I use both just in case of leakage. Tampons are cool but i use a pad too just in case it leaks. Some people just don't like tampons.|`|KZfYzhZRaa	i love tampons im 13 i feel more free in them with pads i feel more i donno uncomfortable i guess i only ware them at night:)|`|KkVUPatCaa	I haven't tried a tampon either,they look confusing.|`|XaYHMNusaa	Tampons, no question.|`|UJdg5zRkaa	I wouldn't trade using tampons for anything. Pads to me just get in the way and are messy.|`|bmu6uhQ3aa	I never tried a tampon either.|`|17v9Y30Uaa	Pads. I only use tampons if I need it (swimming or something)|`|lhxe2XOeaa	i use pads|`|nCMUA50Raa	pads|`|DsNEpN95aa	Definitely Both! You don't want to use tampons all the time, especially when you sleep at night. It's really bad for long periods of time. Tampons are safer and it's less gross because it stops (the you know what) before they leak thru, so in a way, it's cleaner. Make sure you change it in a couple of hours, or else it will leak! <br>  <br>  If you insert it right, tampons are comfortable, or at least they should be. It's all opinion. Do switch back and forth depending on occasions.|`|yaAhsEwxaa	i use tampons.<br>  pads are extremely uncomfortable.<br>  its like sitting on your blood all day <br>  and smelling like a fish,,you dont want that now do you?<br>  <br>  tampons are comfortable its just like wearing underwear you dont feel them sometimes i forget im wearing them and you cant feel stuff coming out either.and i dont get cramps either.<br>  but if your a virgin it might hurt the first time you use them if your not a virgin then its a piece of cake just make sure you put it in right.|`|iUbph2c8aa	I prefer a tampon<br>  if you're not a formal user than it would be uncomfortable but you'll eventually get used to it.<br>  at first it will hurt if you are a virgin but if you are not then it wouldn't hurt......|`|85xUAjBpaa	both. tampons and a pantyliner. tampons are comfortable. pads are gross i think. your sitting in your nasty blood all day :/|`|d2PqwMQMaa	I use tampons during heavy days with a panty liner for back up, on light days I use pads..be sure to buy the correct size..too small, won't work..too large, very uncomfortable.|`|SccU9zdNaa	Pads for cars and everyday stuff-<br>  Tampons for wearing skirt, gym... <br>  <br>  They aren't that weird, you get used to them after the first one or two times.|`|RsC1az2Gaa	I tried tampoons and its a weird feeling...i dunno it depends on the person but pads are good.<br>  Some people feel saffer with tampoons because there is a less chance of leaking:P|`|jcDkS0KIaa	Tampons all the way.|`|tX40VG9Xaa	tampons are a TON less messy and easy to use and they dont hurt.|`|Myah2jU2aa	i use pads; but i've never used a tampon before either. they kind of creep me out.|`|hV5ctpkEaa	Pad all the way........tampons freak me out!|`|w2si6gFMaa	pads! you dont have to worry about TSS and leaking!|`|CBEnnsnxaa	tampons..

Ppev4EAJaa	stereotypes are mean i wear the same thing and i dont consider my self scene/punk|`|AA11387133	I think you should try your best to fit under the "Lola" stereotype.

Even people that don't fit into the hardcore/emo/indie/scenester package wear those.<br>  <br>  What really sets those kids apart is how they wear it.  Their accessories.  Their hair.<br>  <br>  To really tell you what "stereotype" you are, we'd need a picture.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, don't worry about what you are.  I used to really want to fit into the whole scenester group... and I did.  For a long time.  I realized I was much happier and felt much more like myself when I found my own unique style.

That would make such a great campaign! People need to realize what they are wearing!! Sheep would agree :)<br>  <br>  This is a petition to get UGG? Australia to stop using real sheepskin for their shoes. the sheeps may not be killed to get the wool but chances are the sheeps will be slaughtered eventually. If the sheep is no longer needed then it will be slaughtered, also if the sheep has some sort of skin disease its fur cannot be used so it will also be slaughtered. The sheeps are having their fur taken away from them, in a process that can cause them to get cuts that probably hurt. The sheeps grow the fur to protect themselves in certain weather. Also flies feed off of open cuts or the thin layer of exposed skin on the sheeps, causing new wounds. Maggots lay their eggs in the exposed moist skin of the sheeps causing the sheeps to get sick and distressed to the point where they cannot eat drink or sleep and then they die. There are probably many vegans out there who would like to wear some Uggs but wont because they are made with real sheepskin.|`|Ppev4EAJaa	tall u can roll them =]<br>  <br>  answer myne??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ao8DpRxT6exmFrKn.vd_T5Psy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309115019AA9UuQN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AA11172455	I think the taller ones are cutest.|`|lmtusbb7aa	id say middlish, if not long :) xxx|`|gZd5R6TIaa	i think short...

AA11332651	I would personally go with a 14g, since it will be a bit sturdier. That also depends on the location of your veins.

HteSVX6iaa	Ok I have the same problem! =] Pull all your hair up somewhat High bun. Leave pieces of your hair down and then straighten them. Then pull more pieces down and straighten them. When you are about half way down with the back of your head then act like your going to pull that half in a ponytail and look and see what is there. If you see any curls you know where they are. Just grab the curl and let go of all the hair except for that. When you are done run a tad bit of water on your fingers and gradually run your fingers (That have the water on them) through it and it won't be frizzy. If you still have problems just IM me and let me know! Add me! Oh and it might be the straightner you have! Hope I helped!!! =] =] [= [=

I can only wear sterling silver or real gold posts. Use some peroxide on your ears and clean the posts of your earrings after you wear them.

The German flag is fairly simple, and you could just stop by a Hobby Lobby and pick up fabric, acrylic, or 3D paint.<br>  <br>  The sources I found suggested cleaning the surface with a bit of alcohol and (depending on the canvas of the shoe) rubbing it with a very fine sandpaper before painting.<br>  <br>  I've listed some examples of (much more detailed) shoes below:|`|Bdqg2WNvaa	glue it on then put lamenet paste over it|`|u40nkLNGaa	There is a website that allows you to design your own clothes and shoes.

Just use an Anti- Emergency Frizz Control Product until they come in the mail.

Below is a website that carries Garneir Fructis Products. You may find a better website but Good luck! =] =] [= [=

LJkPRqN0aa	i get mine cut every 2 months (but thats a full cut) . its also said that trimming your hair makes your hair grow faster but 4 weeks seems kind of rediculous to me to be cutting it.... i would recommend every 6 weeks for a TRIM|`|UhmrCbHuaa	It is recommended that you cut it every 6 weeks. It depends on your hair type, i'm also trying to grow my hair long and if you go every 3 months or whatever, the more you cut off.. <br>  I went yesterday after not going for 6 weeks and they said they had to give me a 'pretend haircut' because i didn't have any split ends.. if i keep going like that, i suppose i can grow it. I straighten my hair every day, but i use heat defence sprays, maybe you should try them or get a shampoo like Head & Shoulders Damage Rescue.. the review is good and apparently its good for split ends. Your hair does get more split ends in winter though because of the weather, so maybe it will grow more as it gets to summer...<br>  well, i don't know if that answered your question, because i can't remember what i put xD so, good luck in making sense of it :)<br>  You could try this too <br>  <a href="http://www.leestafford.com/uk/products/product.php?pi=37" rel="nofollow">http://www.leestafford.com/uk/products/p...</a>|`|vAhpjdNJaa	4 weeks is really too early.<br>  i would suggest 6-8 weeks. more toward 8. <br>  that gives you 2 months to go to the hair dresser, which is the perfect amount of time i think.|`|VkXQq2y2aa	I'm growing my hair out also...i Just get my hair trimmed whenever the ends are damaged.

tuhjIVH6aa	so youre not fat, by any means.<br>  but i cant exactly guess your weight unless i know how old you are.<br>  and i think you look great in skinny jeans.<br>  skinny jeans make everyone look taller and thinner.<br>  <br>  if you post your age, i could help more.<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  id say you weight MAX 135.<br>  minimum, 120|`|xqljgDHmaa	You. Are. Not. Fat.<br>  Skinny jeans are not flattering on most people, so I suggest dressing for your shape.<br>  You've got a tiny waist and a really great curved shape, so definitly use that to your advantage! Wear jackets that outline your waist, or dresses with belts to accentuate it. Also, waist high skirts will make your legs look longer, giving you an over all slimming effect.<br>  <br>  You are not fat, or ugly, or gross. You aren't dressing for your body though, so start by treating your body like it's beautiful, not like it's something you hate. Love your body! You've got a tiny waist, great curves, and good legs. USE THEM!|`|iWLPGpoCaa	Girl you are not huge or massive.<br>  You are average.<br>  I would say you were around 140-150.<br>  I think a flare jean or boot cut would compliment your shape better than skinny jeans.|`|N7LYAqNJaa	You're alright.

QzfHwGOQaa	Well I would work with some things that you have at home. That being said you could make your own jewelry out of random things around the house.

I always mis-match my socks, it is just cute and fun! For tops you could do to different colors of layers then your tee shirt, you could also layer tanks on tees and do a bunch of crazy stuff. It is not over the top it is just finding yourself and creating your own style! <br>  Peace and Love<br>  ~Nicole|`|ABACQTi1aa	SCARVES.<br>  i am like obsessed with them right now, so i'd definitely go with that. <br>  plus, jewelry, lots of bracelets or necklaces, just throw stuff together and see how it looks, that's what i do.|`|JTZN35sWaa	I say belts, scarfs, bangles, purses, anything like that.

srjPOxW7aa	Keep in mind you can dye your eyebrows too, but there's plenty of blondes with dark eyebrows.. I'm one of them.|`|avlVHXDCaa	ya it would look awsome|`|1rRw5e1Eaa	it really depends on what your face looks like,  if it looks bad you could always dye it back|`|ogdLyldRaa	hello ^_^<br>  <br>  oh i just colored my hair blonde today.<br>  it was originally medium brown and i had dark brown eyebrows,<br>  and blond hair with medium to dark brown eyebrows doesn't look attractive.<br>  so what i did was after i was done putting the bleach on my hair.<br>  i took a q-tip and dipped it into the leftover bleach.<br>  i then smeared it evenly over both eyebrows, being extra careful not to let it drip.<br>  you will want to leave the bleach on your eyebrows for about 4-6 minutes.<br>  just until its about 1 or 2 shades lighter than the original color.<br>  you absolutely don't need to match your eyebrows to your hair color.|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	You could always dye it back if it doesn't look right, but it should look fine, unless the brown is really dark.

KmC0K59taa	When I was a teen flat irons weren't around yet.  I always got mine straight by using a big, round brush when blow drying.  Just work with one section at a time.

Are you a jew. If so nothing. You could stand in front of a moving car, but that could get messy. Try makeup.
uwCcIY8Aaa	What you need to do is this:<br>  1. Get a shower and clean your hair. Make sure it's shampooed and condition thoroughly so you do not cause a lot of damage to your hair when blowing it dry/straightening it.<br>  2. Use an after-the-shower product on your hair to seal the cuticles. I use Moroccan Oil. You can buy it at any local convenient store, and it comes in a small brown bottle. You can also use other products such as BioSilk.<br>  3. Put a small amount of this product into your hair while it is still wet and combed through. Rub it into your hands after pouring out a quarter sized drop. Start rubbing it in from the bottom to the root, so you get the most protection on the length of your hair, where the most damage will be.<br>  4. Blow dry your hair. Grab a hair brush and brush through your hair again to get any lasting snarls/tangles out. Then hold your hair up with the brush and blow it dry so it lays flat. It's okay if it's a little poofy at this point. Do this for the entire head. Make sure you only take small parts of hair at a time. Also make sure your hair is COMPLETELY DRY. If you do not have it completely blown dry, the straightener can cause split ends and burn your hair. It can also possibly catch on fire.<br>  5. Straighten your hair. Divide your hair into to large sections. I suggest going down from the dividing part on the center of your head down your back. So then your two parts of hair are on your shoulders. Then tie one up with a pony tail holder. Then take the other side and brush through it again. take a tiny layer of hair horizontally and leave it down. Then grab a clip and pull your hair back over towards the other side to keep it out of the way while straightening the first layer. Then you just take your flat iron and pick up a piece of hair and start to flat iron. You do this in small sections of hair. You can run over it as many times as you want to get it flat, but the less is the better. It damages your hair less.<br>  <br>  You can usually go a few days without washing your hair then and have your hair look great! This is why you need to have your hair clean and snarl free to make it look nice. Hope this helps! (:|`|vAhpjdNJaa	look up a tutorial on YouTube.<br>  i would give you a description but i think it would be easier for you to learn through visuals. <br>  here's one video that i found, but i don't know if it's exactly what you are looking for:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov7NWAWPbzk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov7NWAWPb...</a>|`|JNsyAxbXaa	I have a tip, not an instruction per se. <br>  <br>  Take a section of you hair, medium thick. This will depend on how thick your hair is. Clamp the straightener down as close to the root as possible and straighten away from your head.<br>  <br>  Before you do this, you may want to section off your hair layers. Take the top layers of you hair and put them in a ponytail on the top of your head. Straighten the bottom layer first.<br>  <br>  Another thing you may want to use is Chi Silk Infusion. It protects your hair from damage and frying and makes it super smooth and frizz-free.|`|2K6i0M2naa	Use it like any other straighter and if you don't know how to do that go onto youtube and type in 'how to straighten hair'. BUT BE SURE TO USE A PROTECTOR SPRAY OR CREAM ON YOUR HAIR BEFORE STRAIGHTENING, make sure it says protects from heat damage or else you hair will get FRIED, trust me, I have a chi.|`|DnZqpdQDaa	What you do is:<br>  1. Think<br>  2. Get some hair<br>  3. Put the straightener on the hair and squeeze it<br>  4. Pull down in a vertical manner (FYI: not towards your face)<br>  5. Repeat until done.<br>  <br>  Simple enough, right? All you had to do was use that organ that is in your head, but in your case, it's a lacking in basic thinking functions, but that's alright to be a little slow.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you think in the future. ^_^|`|oJEtWqMYaa	its really not that hard..you put your hair in the straightener and straighten..|`|YAjmiDJraa	Clip parts of it up and straighten it in layers.<br>  <br>  And definitely sprat stuff on it to protect it..like Biosilk.
XaYHMNusaa	All piercers are prepared for if someone so happens to pass out or freak out, so I'd do it if I were you.  When I got my navel pierced the piercer had me lie down on a padded-table thing when she pierced me.

A normal belly button piercing is a 14 gauge.<br>  <br>  For you, I'd say no.|`|04hIdBbYaa	ummmmm... i don't know if you should since you passed out when you got your ears pierced, you only should do it if YOU really want to not if your friends want you to, plus, pierced belly buttons look good during swim suit season!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|jBpPesehaa	No. You couldnt handle your ears what makes you think you can handle the belly button?

edCUawppaa	I would get it done a few days before your trip because IT HURTS!!!! Mine lasted for about 3 weeks. And I didnt get any red bumps or anything but it did bleed a little after she did it.|`|XaYHMNusaa	I used to get them once or twice a month  :]<br>  <br>  -It last 2-4 weeks.<br>  -You can get ingrown hairs from getting waxed [the hair being yanked in awkward positions].  After I started have problems w/ ingrowns one of the ladies who worked at my spa told me to start exfoliating every day w/ St. Ive's Apricot Blemish and Blackhead Scrub, w/ a loofah.  It works so well!<br>  -If I were you, I'd get it the day before the trip.  You'll probably be a bit swollen after getting it done, but it's not crippling.
PevIirOcaa	You're really pretty........but I think have one length instead of layers could really work for you.....and have it cut straight across in the back...and have your front hair tapered in..and have side bangs..would look hot! Good luck....

HMhUKAgkaa	I get about 1/2" to 1" a month. It makes my hair really shiny and strong too. I can't tell what it does to my nails though because I have acryllic nails. My skin hasn't changed either.

1Gf4Ylz6aa	I have damaged hair too.I just bought a deep conditioner and used it. My hair feels a lot softer after just one use. The name of it is organic root stimulator Hair Mayonnaise. I believe you can get it at sally beauty supply altough I didn't buy mine there. You might also want to use a shampoo for dry/damaged hair so you won't dry out your hair even more by shampooing it, I would have bought the aloe shampoo from the same line if it wasn't on the bottom shelf because I couldn't reach it because I had surgery. Also after conditioning your hair you also want to use a hair lotion.|`|KkVUPatCaa	Just keep taking really good care of your hair until it's fixed :P<br>  <br>   I don't think there are any quick fixes,except a hat.<br>  <br>  But I do reccomend a product from CHI called silk infusion. It makes my hair soft,smooth,and healthy.|`|5v1c50Ybaa	go to a salon and get them to help you, wait a month or two otherwise your hair might damage, or fall out.<br>  if you want to get rid of it NOW, go buy this powder stuff called Quick Blue by Loreal, it strips hair of the color and it should get rid of the treatment too, and will not damage your hair.
EL45UeUJaa	Yeah its fine, as long as you use a q tip after you put them on to help them into place. Also you can trim them a bit if they are a bit too long. Put on eyeliner along the lash line after wards, to hide the line between the lid and the lashes. Curl the lashes carefully if you need to also, and apply mascara :D|`|9zet0NWXaa	If your alright with people knowing that you're wearing them it's fine.<br>  No matter what you do they will look fake...but I say have confidence and rock them!|`|5Jvw2l7raa	Hi,<br>  It'll be fine hunnie don't worry.

eIBNzTXHaa	i have it and it works very well but you cant use it too often because it could irritate your skin. also if the hairs are too long then it wont work. but other than that i reccommend it. its easy and painless|`|wnnudNp5aa	I think it will work, although I haven't tried it. Basically, it's a fine grade of sandpaper! That held little appeal for me!|`|XCzpQvDvaa	I have no doubt it works, im a welder(and a man) and it looks just like sand paper...i once hit my arm with a grinder that had a sanding pad and it took the hair off(along with a few other layers) so yah i think it would work...not sure how it would feel if you got agressive with it tho (remember you are literally sanding off the hairs)
IUeav3oXaa	You are very pretty!! Since you have brown hair I would chose dark blue!|`|GZUZqazcaa	to upload a pic,go on tinypic.com and upload and paste the url here,or go on photobucket and upload then post..because I can't tell by an avatar.|`|C23OXIbpaa	i think you would probably need a dark color contact because your eyes are already dark, so maybe a deep blue?|`|d662a7ad0f118e08f311eec065c3ac54aa	i think light blue would look nice.|`|2h913O0Saa	green and black and lizars
XaYHMNusaa	I've heard that you're supposed to keep a piece of a specific kind of tape on them for a while...I think when you sleep?<br>  And you should definately be careful after how much shampoo and stuff touches it.  Or at least makes sure to rinse it all off if you get some onto it.<br>  Saline solutions [such as Blairex Wound Wash] is good to spray on your anchor [then you must rinse off w/ fresh water] and you may do warm compresses [take gauze, dip it in a warm sea salt solution].  Sea salt soaks aren't recommended for surface anchors b/c, unlike a regular piercing, there's only one exit hole [well, just one hole period] so the site can't drain well.
snGWtzX5aa	Absolutely nothing, its no different than getting a tattoo on any other part of your body.|`|pvrLSTZzaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with it. The only problem that I can think of is if you are looking for a new job, they might not like that you have a visible tattoo.|`|04hIdBbYaa	I don't think so, but it depends on what type of tattoo you get on your finger. I would get it on my ankle or the small of my back, that way people can't really see it.|`|rlBkq8cpaa	because you cant hide them, it can make it more difficult to get a job. Also the colour doesnt stay aswell.<br>  <br>  but i have tats on 2 fingers and i love them|`|tOYzBlRDaa	i think that its hard to hide your tattoo on your finger but its not that bad.  i usually see people that have like fake rings or flowers on their fingers.|`|EqlBgfgTaa	The only reason I would avoid tattoo'n my hands is because it is one of the more painful areas where one can be tattoo'd.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Its probably because they are so visible and the color doesn't stay too well.

Oh, and both girls are in art school.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	Get a tattoo of a piece of string tied in a knot.<br>  <br>  That way, you'll never forget you have a tattoo of a string tied in a knot.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	most places wont tattoo fingers because the ink will fade to a ggreen mush very very fast. the skin on your fingers constalnty changes because whether you notice it or not they gain and lose all the time. and so the image will be hideous|`|5FNxzZleaa	lol listen to that guy!<br>  or get a mustache tattooed on your finger and be like habalaba
BZEN8QXbaa	he has a tattoo gun and is pretty decent with it. <br>  <br>  That does not sound good,or smart to get it done by him..|`|ss48BEk5aa	If he's as good as he claims to be, he will have thorough instructions for you. Just so you know, those tattoos don't last long at all. (teeth and gums constantly rubbing against it) Not worth it in my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I love tattoos and have plenty, I just think lip tats are pointless.|`|PPvk105Caa	Well you getting it done by a non-professional can make you at risk for one day getting your lip cut off or skinned to prevent further infection that could build into your whole face & possible paralyzing you etc. <br>  It's very dangerous to do something like that at home, or a friend doing it. The tattoo gun doesn't make a difference, ink is going into your face either way, but getting it done by a pro will keep you safer & they'll provide you with steps & cream to care for it. If you're mature enough to get a tattoo, be responsible enough to care for it.|`|SwtENJdOaa	Are you crazy? Sorry to come off kinda rude but please dont have anyone every tattoo you if they are not a professional! Since tattoos are perminate they will be on your body for your whole life, therefore you deserve the best by trusting someone who KNOWS what their doing and is professional. With that they will tell you the proper way to take care of it afterwards and plus they would know how to tattoo properly, since the lip is a delicate small area. So please, leave work like that to the professional, its worth the money!|`|HzCBOwlyaa	Yes, your lip swells for a couple of days after you get a lip tattoo. If it gets infected, it will get all hot and produce pus, just like a normal tattoo infection. You'll have to go to the doctor for antibiotics if it gets infected. It CAN fade quickly

I have had mine for about three years. good luck!
RWYMy7jOaa	How close are you to this friend?<br>  <br>  ask him why he wants to know if you still like him. <br>  <br>  (:|`|FivqlPUCaa	HMMMMM|`|9RjeQxeQaa	It seems like you don't really care about your friends feelings.<br>  <br>  Boys over girls eh?<br>  <br>  Fix up.|`|bVp9CeTIaa	i wouldn't hurt my friend over some lame crush.|`|FGSNuP1Uaa	Since he's going out with your friend, don't steal him from her, but DO let him know you "fancy" him.|`|EBrfolf7aa	Don't go for him and don't let him know you fancy him. He's taken and clearly wants to 'have his cake and eat it', so next time he asks you if you like him say 'Why would i like someone who's going out with my friend? so long as you make her happy, that's all I care about.'
STLYxP39aa	Yes, I think a lip piercing would suit you well.<br>  Also do it while you're young and it doesn't really matter. Remember that piercings aren't permanent and you can take it out if you get bored of it.|`|fGs6DLoraa	i dunno<br>  maybe|`|YGoz8wiZaa	i don't think it would, no offence.|`|XaYHMNusaa	I think it would suit you really well, but get it b/c YOU want it and think it would look good [not based on someone else's opinion].
Gy1YkHoeaa	That dress is so cute and metallic shoes are totally on trend. Make sure you wear silver jewelry. You can wear those shoes to dress up skinnies for a night out. This hairstyle would be cute for your semi <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/78779495@N00/1339856580/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/78779495@N0...</a><br>  Have wonderful time!<br>  :D|`|Mkh6V7CXaa	the silver shoes would look good with the dress but you could also wear the black ones. if you were going out for dinner you could wear the shoes with nice pants and a fancy top or you could wear them with different dresses or skirts. depending on what you weaar them with they could be dressed up or down. i would put your hair up or at least half up because the dress is very busy and colorful. here are some ideas.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/prom-hairstyles.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.masslive.com/prom/2008/04/large_prom-hairstyles-ochoa-back.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blog.masslive.com/prom/2008/04/la...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/prom-hairstyles-4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hrhairstyles.com/eva-longoria-updo-hair-styles.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrhairstyles.com/eva-longoria...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|AA12221436	Nope.

Your not ugly hun you're very pretty!!<br>  <br>  And i think that would look very pretty on you!<br>  And like other people say take that picture into the hairdresser.<br>  Its what i always do when i don't know the name of a haircut.|`|KkVUPatCaa	Don't say anything, hand your stylist the picture and if you do want any differences between yours and Selenas (longer,shorter,etc..) tell them that. That's what I do:)<br>  <br>   And no,you aren't ugly|`|PHkDtKcVaa	first you aint  ugly! and just take a pic and tell them that what you want!|`|f0fQlwMlaa	just print out that pic. and show your stylist. & nope your not ugly :)|`|05XKZC8Gaa	No u are not ugly and you should get a picture out of a magazine like one of those kid gossip magazine where they talk about people like the jonas brothers and demi lavato and take it to your hair dresser and tell her that's exactly what you want?|`|4XKCa47haa	ONE - you're actually sorta gorgeous [ NO HOMO ]<br>  TWO - print the picture, if you cant then..<br>  THREE - say you want shoulder length hair, with blunt bangs.<br>  <br>  (:|`|YAjmiDJraa	Just take a pic of Selena Gomez to your stylist. Yea it would look good.<br>  <br>  And nah not really.<br>  <br>  Everyone is beautiful in God's eyes. :)|`|5v1c50Ybaa	it already looks like it a lot, just take the picture to them after your hair grows out. and ask about having it layered.

cQJGaUK4aa	To keep your hair looking healthier you need to trim 1/2 to 1 inch every 6 weeks...<br>  Also that is just an old" wives tale" about cutting your hair to makes it grow quicker because your hair grows from  roots out not from the ends...<br>  But my mom always told me that too....|`|xv3opX9Maa	i go every 3 - 4 months <br>  i hate getting trims because the least they ussually take off is half  an inch or more and it takes atleast a month to grow hair that much<br>  it has no effect on your hairs growth, it will still grow the same wether you trim it or not, but the reason why people tell you to trim it is because when your hair does grow out and it is long and it has split ends half way up it will look really bad and frizzy and its not gonna be pretty.<br>  have you ever looked at someone with long hair down their back and thought it was so pretty but then seen another person with the same length hair that looked awfull because it has so much split ends<br>  ( =|`|j9nhk1v2aa	Every two weeks|`|pWqkGJl1aa	yes you should get your hair cut cut every two months because when you don't all the ends just keep breaking off and your haril will never grow.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	no, what does your ends have to do with your roots. cutting your ends just give you a neater appearance it has nothing to do with your growth rate|`|3b2ecc694fa7536f10ef0b60f4c9c939aa	every 2 months|`|3XAdFuXcaa	Some people have a healthy scalp,that they can easily produce more new hair follicles. Some have not, just like me. So it all depends on the person's head/hair production capability.|`|HFsRHZS6aa	Yes, you should cut your hair at least one inch, if not more, every two months to avoid dry or split ends. Split ends can stunt hair growth.|`|nfAM7NcMaa	well i have long hair the hair dresser told me every six weeks your suppost to get your hair cut to get rid of dry split ends|`|jYQxGhSuaa	Trim 1-2 inches every two months and it will grow out.|`|YAjmiDJraa	1 to 2 months. And trim them ends because your hair will grow healthier.|`|KkVUPatCaa	You should get your hair trimmed every 4-6 weeks
kTAMsqT2aa	your brother is a perv if he wants to touch his own sisters boobs, any brother that would enjoy doing that is messed up. just tell him that. kicking him in the balls probably isnt a good idea. just see if he does it again and if he does i say go for it! and dont do it too hard cuz that can affect him being able to have children later in life|`|AA10792562	1) Yes, with shoes<br>  2) Yes<br>  <br>  But you are going to need some girlfriends to hold him down while you hit him.  It may be more difficult to connect than you think.|`|yPsbuFgvaa	Haha. Kick him in the balls and wear shoes and don't let him have Advil afterwards.<br>  Your mom's right, give him a taste of his own medicine.|`|SWsDa1iXaa	Make sure you are wearing some pretty painful shoes (like heels or steel-toed) when you DO kick him in the balls, and hide the advil.|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	yes deff. wear shoes <br>  no let him suffer hahahahahahaha|`|PevIirOcaa	Thats some weird sh*t!|`|LuTjBw4Laa	kick him in the balls and wear shoes so you don't have to feel them. if your mom says its okay then she wont be mad, and once your brother either stops crying or starts to breathe again after you kick him in the balls sit him down and tell him that if he touches your boobs then that'sgonna happen again. and if he is smart he wont EVER do it again. have fun kickin some balls! (:|`|9a8ad2bd74ef14daf7f98aee3567f253aa	HEELS/STILLETTOS<br>  <br>  get him HARD<br>  <br>  right in the crotch that freak deserves it haha. <br>  <br>  oh and <br>  NO<br>  ADVIL<br>  <br>  =]<br>  mwahahahaha.|`|DhTtm3ayaa	Kick him in the balls while wearing heels.

zTw7IuYHaa	kick him!!!!! and no advil whatever that is lol xD|`|oWTXPtxwaa	I agree with Stacey.|`|1Hx7MFUvaa	Why is your brother going after your breasts? He might have some sort of sexual disorder if he continually goes for that region.  Your mom shouldn't tell you to go at him back with violence. She needs to step in and reprimand him. Your whole family sounds like they need help.|`|ls7tcUpiaa	kick him really hard with like spikes on or something,,and no advil....he sounds like a huge jerk, and i would have kicked him in the balls before i got permission...|`|d0WK1j47aa	i would totally kick his nuts for you haha. i say no advil, ive been in similar situations.
LtP7oOtraa	wow...KICK HIM...HARD....don't give him advil...tell him to take a midol. i would leave the shoes for if he's stupid enough to do it again.|`|a2wZg7DQaa	hell yeah kick him back and tell him to stop doing that to you because its dangerous!|`|KkVUPatCaa	Kick him hard!<br>  <br>   Advil after like,an hour if he needs it:)<br>  <br>   Ha!|`|CiDV0Y6Waa	This is stupid. If your mother thinks that thats a good idea she has an interesting view on parenting. Why doesn't she just make him stop. And if your old enough to have boobs your old enough to answer this on your own.|`|y2gBPwUVaa	i agree this is totally stupid! maybe your mom should step in and tell him to stop and then punish him herself. this is so stupid|`|FVPOxaeJaa	You let him give you a purple nurple? How old are you? Of course tell your mom and let her kick him in the balls and don't let him take any Advil. If you let him do this, he might do it to his girlfriends if he has any. I would wear shoes.

Most schools dont have it at all anymore because its to much liabity. I don't think you have to worry about that, but if they do schools nowadays arent as harsh as tv, and you will probly not have to climb very high, or as high as you feel comfortable. In gym classes nowadays its just all about if you try your best, you dont have to be the best at gym!|`|yPsbuFgvaa	Every middle school is different in what you do in gym class. We had strength days where we went into the workout room and there were different stations, and yes one of them was climbing a rope. Don't let this simple thing freak you out though. It's realy not that difficult and you shouldn't let something like that make you so nervous.|`|wF3Znuodaa	I didn't have to. it depends on the school and the P.E. teacher you get I think, so maybe ask around people who already went to middle school.|`|9a8ad2bd74ef14daf7f98aee3567f253aa	um...we had to do that in elementary school.....|`|DhTtm3ayaa	I'm in 6th grade caus we consider middle school 6-8.

kTAMsqT2aa	don't you'll look orange! my suggestion is tanning mositurizer like the jergins stuff it builds up a tan gradually so if you start to look orange you can just stop. im a redhead and im really pale and it works for me|`|yPsbuFgvaa	My suggestion, don't go spray tanning at all.  It makes you look orange no matter what level you do and you get streaks, really bad streaks. My suggestion would be to go to a tanning bed. Go for little incrimates of time, that way you won't get burnt.|`|wnnudNp5aa	An airbrush tan is the way to go. Go to a good salon that has been offering this service for some time, that way you be assured of getting a good one. I got one for vacation a few years ago, and it looked great, not fake at all! It lasted for almost two weeks, too.<br>  Your other option is a high-end tanning salon. They now offer "no-burn" beds. I still burned a little bit (I'm a redhead, too), but if you go for the minimum amount of time, you can probably get some decent color with a few sessions. I've also used regular beds, but only go for about 10 minutes instead of the usual 20. I've managed to get a tan that way, too.<br>  Don't try a do-it-yourself self tanner. It's really hard to get good results with those. You usually wind up with streaks, and/or dark knees and elbows.|`|7epndEFHaa	find somebody that does custom airbrushing!! call a few salons, they would prob have it. and its not even too much like $30 for the whole body plus the color lasts up to like 2 weeks. and you wont turn orange bc she will give you a color consultation and even do test patches!! haha ps i just got my airbrushing license sooo i would most def recommend doing this rather than spray tanning! and its much more healthy than a tanning bed. let me know if you have anymore questions, and enjoy your prom! :)|`|ne2ltUKwaa	get the lightest one. just be careful cos you dont want it going wrong for your prom. <br>  have a nice prom!<br>  :D
