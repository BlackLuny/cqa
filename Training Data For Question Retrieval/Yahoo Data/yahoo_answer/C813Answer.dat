C090xHPQaa	In the United States, authentic Cuban-made cigars often carry a mystique among some aficionados for being perceived as "the best smoking experience" of all cigars, and for being "forbidden fruit" for Americans to purchase.<br>  <br>  Cigars are often presented as stereotypical rich man's accessory. Cigars are often smoked to celebrate good fortune, like the birth of a child, a graduation, a big business accomplishment, etc. Some buy and keep a cigar 'for luck' with regard to a bet, with the intention of smoking it after winning the bet. The expression "close, but no cigar", said after a near miss, derives from that tradition.So if your site is dedicated to this kind demographic then you will definitely excel promoting our cigars.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Buying cigars for someone is very difficult as premium, hand rolled cigars are a very subjective choice.<br>  <br>  If your friend smokes Black and Milds, he may not get the nuances of storing, clipping and smoking a 'real' cigar.<br>  <br>  That being said,  based on his preference in B&M's, I would suggest something in the Acid Line by Drew Estates.  They are flavored cigars and would be inline with what he is used to.  I would just make sure that you get him something that is mild to medium in body.<br>  <br>  Some good places to buy them are:<br>  <br>  Famous-smoke.com<br>  CigarsInternational.com<br>  JRCigars.com<br>  MikesCigars.com<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.......|`|jW2Q7xvvaa	Instead of buying him a box maybe you want to create your sampler. The website below will allow you to pick and chose individual cigars. Here are some brands I love and I'm sure your friend will to. Montecristo White, Romeo y Juileta Vintage,  Ashton Cabinet Selection or maybe Partagas!  Good luck and enjoy!|`|41Qwr0Eqaa	buy him some swiss blunts and a sack of weed....lol|`|Lzsm5L0Naa	Hear you get best one sir<br>  In the United States, authentic Cuban-made cigars often carry a mystique among some aficionados for being perceived as "the best smoking experience" of all cigars, and for being "forbidden fruit" for Americans to purchase.|`|c9bf9e4444e41a5ed824a8c1d8210db4aa	u can get black and milds at any gas store for like 5 bucks a box. it not bad. i personally love them.
MN5PwQKBaa	It will cut it down, yes, but it is not impossible. The reason for eating soy is that it is a legume so it makes it very easy to get the complete set of essential amino acids. If you eat the right combinations of vegetables, you can still get those same amino acids. For instance, black beans and rice are a complete amino acid set. Other legumes also are rich in protein, such as lentils and sprouted beans. There is rice milk and rice dream ice cream available that contains no soy. If you eat a well balanced diet high in whole fruits and vegetables (not canned), whole grains (such as quinoa, couscous, etc, not processed breads or flours), and nuts/seeds (sesame seeds, peanuts, etc) you will be fine. You can also supplement your normal meals with things like wheatgrass drinks, nutritional yeast, rice bran syrup, etc. There are many ways to be vegan without eating soy.|`|6SlQHPoMaa	i dont eat soy, except on the rare occassion, and Im a vegan. To be a vegan u do not need soy. I use rice milk that is fortied with chick peas instead of soy. Most people probably eat soy for the protein that u can easily get from other sources instead such as chick peas and other legumes and a variety of nuts, espescially almonds. Also it may not  be soy u are allergic to but a type of protein derived from brazil nuts used to genetically modify many soy products, which is proven to be highly allergenic. worth looking into.|`|kqrxVgDBaa	Soy isn't at all a staple in the vegan diet.<br>  <br>  When you look for a non-dairy "milk", just go for something non-soy like: rice milk, hemp milk, almond milk, oat milk, hazelnut milk etc.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just eat regular plant foods: fruits, veggies, grains, beans/legumes (kidney, pinto, peas, etc), nuts & seeds, herbs & spices.<br>  <br>  Good plant sources of calcium (other than soy) include: spinach, kale, great northern beans, small white beans, figs, almonds, tahini, chickpeas, oranges, collard greens, oats, seaweed etc.|`|WcMMBENAaa	I don't think it will cut down your options that much more than they're already cut.  Soy seems to be in nearly everything (everything packaged, that is), vegan or not.  <br>  <br>  As people have pointed out, there are plenty of other options.  The biggest problem might be butter alternatives (which are important if you're big on baking).  There are even some soy-free vegan convenience foods (like vegan ice cream, etc.).|`|O3ejRFVjaa	it will cut it down a bit. a lot of people see soy as their big dose-o-protien. like the  man said, there are MANY other sources of protein and hemp/rice products rather than soy. go to a whole foods store or look around online. you'll find something.|`|kQQ6o81caa	just eat fruits and veggies, soy isnt a "must"|`|Sseypv3caa	Soy is like a drop of water in a lake. It's just one plant out of thousands.<br>  <br>  Bread, pasta, rice, beans, peas, lentils, nuts, seeds, fruits and veggies. That's all that you need.

Está interesante esta información y hace mas de 10 a?os que todos los dias al desayuno como 1 platano y un jugo de 2 naranjas, el jugo lo hago yo en el momento y la verdad es que no me gustan otro tipos de jugo, solo los que hago yo, lo hago y los bebo: una maravilla; cuanto a la fruta que como por dia es asi: el platano y las 2 naranjas (en jugo), despues a medio de la ma?ana como por veces una papaya y antes de la cena como siempre 2 manzanas, esto es lo que hago siempre, pero por ejemplo ahora es el tiempo de las fresas/frutillas y las como a medio de la tarde o las bebo (hago un jugo puro sin agua), también como otro tipo de frutas y es muy raro comerlas despues de la comida o de la cena, durante la comida y/o cena lo que pasa es que muchas veces hago una limonada (limones mios 100% biologicos) y me encanta...la verdad es que me encantan todos los tipos de fruta, menos los higos.

Millions of people drink and only a small percentage become alcoholics or winos. Social drinking is a staple of western civilization. As someone once put it, 'Alcohol is the great lubricant of society'. It's nice you care for your friend, but it really seems like you're mothering him here. He can make his own decisions. If it gets to the point where he's drinking in the mornings (generally a bad sign), getting drunk alone (nothing wrong with a drink or two on your own, but getting drunk alone is generally another bad sign), or drinking heavily almost every day, then you might consider holding a sort of intervention with his family, if everyone close to him can agree it really is a problem.<br>  <br>  As it is, a bit of drinking is both perfectly normal and healthy, and you have neither a right nor reason to interfere.|`|c3vWKdKyaa	Does he show signs of a problem?<br>  <br>  There is absolutely nothing wrong with the consumption of alcohol when done correctly.

First, she'd cook the bacon, then sauté the onion (a medium sized one) in the bacon grease, then add the beans (a can), mustard (a squeeze or 2), ketchup (a large spoon-full) & brown sugar (around a 1/4C packed) to the onions & cook it all together, then put the bacon on top & let it simmer a bit.  She never really measured anything precisely, thats just how i remember watching her make it!|`|5DEjWiWUaa	Fry up a small onion and some Green peppers(Serrano) if you like it hot and then add the baked beans from a can.

You can also eat quinoa... a fabulous complete protein grain from Peru.

KzU8MYGWaa	thats funny to me because i grew up in phoenix, where pomegranate trees abound! the hard way- one at a time. the easy way- juice them, or better yet, go to your store, avoid the seeds(al beit they are fun in a way, kinda like sunflower seeds)and drink "pom". lol i like the ques. though! thanks for the memories and the two points!!bon apetite|`|0buyqUvsaa	I use a knife to peel the skin off, exposing the seeds inside their pods.

Separating the red arils is simplified by performing this task in a bowl of water, whereby arils sink and pulp floats.

4zp6Uz2Haa	The trick is to make one liquid much denser than the other which ever you want on the bottom should be the denser liquid, you can add sugar, starches, etc to make it dense.  The bottom part will be a lot sweeter than the top so make the top a little tart to balance each other. poor the syrupy liquid in the punch bowl and then using a ladle poor the second liquid over the spoon gently to create your layers....if using alcohol is an option maybe use guiness as the black and then a fruit punch as the top....not sure what would taste good with it though....LOL|`|jWk72GNSaa	Two ways - Make your punch red, remove some and mix it with black food color. Freeze the black punch into and ice cube (freeze it in one big lump and it will last longer). Float the black ice in your red punch.<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  Make jello, let it "set" in the bottom of a clear glass punch bowl. Now pour the real punch on top of it. It will stay at the bottom. You can mix all kinds of colors doing it this way. <br>  <br>  If it's for Halloween, you can put gummys into the jello only part way, let it set, then when you pour the pucnh into it, the loose parts float and look like they're trying to escape. 
DKdQ7swZaa	no worries. fruit juices and soda's good to go...... diet soft drinks for women uh uh.... (Aspartame is killing women all over the world do your research) though I think you mean alcoholic beverages, as drinks are already mixed (usually)|`|TJOHxhEUaa	The only danger would be that you're diluting the alcohol, so might end up drinking more than you would otherwise.  Sangria is red wine mixed with fruit juice and it's been around for centuries.|`|JqUGmk3Paa	As far as the danger aspect goes, even mixing drinks isnt necessarily dangerous, it will just make you sick.<br>  <br>  sodas, juices, and energy drinks aren't dangerous when mixed with alcohol, they just dilute it and make it taste better.

Also, the energy drinks may also mask the effects of the alcohol until you have consumed enough to make you vomit or even end up with alcohol poisoning which can make you seriously ill or even cause death.|`|QZlH0ziaaa	Probably not since some of the most common drinks combine the two. ie:  rum & coke, whiskey & 7-up, vodka & grapefruit juice, vodka & orange juice.|`|6sbxVtE3aa	Rum and coke, gin and tonic-it's been going on for years.

Chill Jello; when it begins to get firm arrange the mandarin slices evenly in the Jello.<br>  <br>  When the bottom layer is set, make the middle layer. Prepare the lemon Jello using 1/4 cup of lemonade concentrate as part of the cold water. Add the crushed pineapple to this layer. Allow to set.<br>  <br>  For the top layer, prepare the Dream Whip and lemon instant pudding according to directions. Then combine and blend well with a rubber spatula. Add this to the top of the lemon layer.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Just make your jello using less boiling water and lthan add your ginerale in place of the other water.

N0dTWMwXaa	You begin to enjoy your drinking.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	in the same sitting? that sounds kinda gross, but I dont think you will get any ill effects like when you mix whiskey and beer.|`|XwacWyy6aa	Mixing the grape and the grain will give you a worse hangover.|`|TeY6Q2gpaa	The first few drinks of beer will taste horrible. Soon you will adjust and enjoy the beer. Mixing any drinks and getting sick is just a matter of how much alcohol you drink and how fast you do it. But that is it the alcohol whether it is beer, wine, whiskey, or anything will not get you sick just because you have mixed them. Again, it is the amount and time that you drink so go slow or even very slow.

If you can control yourself - and not scarf down more than 10 (250 calories)  you'll be alright.|`|8lYZROjuaa	Karen Collins <br>  <br>  <br>  Q: Are olives fattening? <br>  <br>  A: No single food can properly be called fattening. It's the total number of calories you eat compared to the amount of calories you burn up that determines whether you have excess calories that will be stored as fat. Of course, the more foods you eat that are high in calories, the quicker you reach the fat-storing stage. <br>  <br>  Olives are higher in calories than many fruits and vegetables because of their fat content. Five jumbo olives (or nine small ones) contain about 35 calories. By contrast, the same portion of carrots would have about 15 calories, and celery or radishes would have only about six. <br>  <br>  If you include only small amounts of olives in salads or mixed dishes, the extra calories won't matter. The fat content is nothing to panic about either. Although five jumbo olives contain about three grams of fat, the vast majority is a monounsaturated fat, which is not linked with risk of cancer or heart disease. <br>  <br>  <br>  ---- <br>  <br>  (Karen Collins is a nutritionist with the Washington, D.C.-based American Institute for Cancer Research)|`|fe6a754aca8e788e17af28f07592cd0aaa	Honestly, anything you eat is considered fat that the body uses.

There is no one to impress by the "amazing" things that you can do when your drunk. And there is not much to be entertained by if you are alone. Also you said that "nothing matters but getting more beer into you". This is a little frightening. When you get drunk it is usually about having fun with friends. If not it is sad. And to only care about drinking more could mean that you care more about the alcohol than the fun, meaning you could be an angry drunk or just angry all around. I would not drink alone.

But getting high is stupid, and getting drunk can be fun if you don't go overboard. But, it also affects people differently.

If you have a lot to drink you can feel sick and puke and feel spinning,   or you might have a great time and dance haha it depends. And as for being high (I assume you're talking about weed?) it feels weird but good most the time, and naturally you feel happy and want to laugh, but it depends.

I40vnqNyaa	I can see what your asking and its a good question.  If you dont have an oven and the microwave is your only choice then this sounds like a good recipe.  <br>  <br>  The microwave is a handy tool but can be a little tricky to cook things like chicken breast in.  The quantity you use in the microwave affects the cooking time greatly, as will the size of the chicken breasts.  Its better to cook for a longer time at a lower power setting than it is to cook for a shorter period of time on high.  14 minutes in the microwave on high seems like a long time to cook 2 chicken breasts. If you cook them for this length of time on high you'll probably find they will be overcooked and dry on the ends and possibly undercooked in the middle.  <br>  <br>  If it were me i would cook for the first 7 minutes at 60% power, then take it out and check how done it is at this stage.  It will probably need to go back in for the next 7 minutes but again i would do it at a lower setting so it cooks through more evenly.  In the oven they would normally cook in approx 20-30 mins depending on the size of the breasts.  To check if chicken is cooked all the way through, use a sharp knife and make a small incision in the chicken, if the juices run clear and arnt pink it will be ready.  When done set aside on a plate,  loosley covered with foil and allow to rest for five mins.<br>  <br>  Here are a few microwave cooking tips to help you make the most of your microwave.. <br>  <a href="http://www.plasticsinfo.org/s_plasticsinfo/sec_level4_alt.asp?CID=576&DID=2297" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticsinfo.org/s_plasticsin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.plasticsinfo.org/s_plasticsinfo/sec_level4_alt.asp?CID=576&DID=2298" rel="nofollow">http://www.plasticsinfo.org/s_plasticsin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-gourmet-recipes.com/microtips.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-gourmet-recipes.com/micr...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck..  Let us know how it turns out :)|`|1hciyvKdaa	Cooking any meats, its about the temp that makes it cook long enogh to taste good, but more importantly to kill any bacteria. Invest in a food thermomter its marked with the minimun temperature and you check after you think the meal is done.  More and more people are getting food poisoning, they do not realize that the microwave can leave cold or lesser than done temperatures, we all get that cold bite occassionally on a lot of foods. Since you have to cook using the microwave, invest in a cheap food thermometer and use it religiously. Also sliced the chicken up so that it cooks faster, or beef or whatever. I saw that people had already helped with the time issue, so I thought I would write about something that has been in the news alot lately.

Look for a banana that is yellow in color and lightly speckled with small brown or black speckles. Large brown spots indicate an over-ripe banana with a mushy consistency. Green bananas usually need more time to ripen, or use a method to ripen the banana.<br>     2. Peel the banana. Some people prefer to peel the entire thing and then eat it, while other peel as they go.<br>            * You can peel from the stalk, as you have something to hold on to.<br>            * You can also peel from the non-stalky end in the same way that monkeys peel them - this usually leads to less "banana strings" and you can use the stalk as a handle.<br>     3. Remove the "banana strings" as you go. (The fibrous bits that run the length of the banana between the edible part and the peel.)<br>     4. Throw the skin away.<br>            * If you are in a closed environment (such as in a car on a trip, or in a hotel room) either seal the peel in a closed bag or find another garbage can away from your area. Banana peels can fill a room with their scent in no time.<br>            * Banana peels make very good compost. You may want to save your leftover banana peels if you collect compost for your garden.<br>            * Alternatively, banana peels can be used in many recipes. Banana peels are a main ingredient in many east-Indian desserts and main courses.<br>  <br>  <br>  ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO EAT A BANANA<br>  <br>  Try any of these ways to eat a banana:<br>  <br>      * Make recipes like banana cake, banana milkshake, banana pudding, a banana split, banana bread, or chocolate banana bread!<br>      * Fry sliced bananas in butter, splash on some rum, and when the rum is hot, set fire to the fumes to impress your guests. Add a little orange juice and cook till hot again, sprinkle with dark brown sugar and serve with cream or ice cream. This dessert is so nice it is illegal in some countries.<br>      * Mash a ripe banana and mix it with natural yogurt to make a delicious breakfast or dessert.<br>      * Freeze a banana to eat as a nutritious Popsicle-like frozen treat. You can also coat in melted chocolate or insert a stick before freezing to make it easier to hold.<br>  <br>  TIPS<br>  <br>      * Some people think that you can open a banana only from the top (the part that is longer.) The best way is to pinch the bottom nub of the banana and the peel at the top will begin to split. This way, no excessive mashing will occur. Enjoy your non-squished banana!<br>      * If the banana you want to eat is too green, put it in a brown paper bag for 24 hours and the next day it will be yellow! Alternatively, you may leave the banana at the ready on your counter, where it will ripen nicely on its own.<br>      * Ripening bananas emit an enzyme that causes other fruit to ripen more quickly! This is why some people store them away from the fruit bowl and even hang them up on little wooden stands.<br>  <br>  <br>  WARNING<br>  <br>      * Bananas go bad if kept out too long. However, if the smooth whiteness is spoiled by a little bad spot, you don't need to throw the banana away -- just carve that nasty bit out with a knife.<br>      * Keeping bananas with apples may imbue the banana skin bad color (brown instead of yellow).<br>      * If you store your bananas in refrigerator, this will cause them to turn brown/black. However, this is only a cosmetic change. The interior regions of your crescent-shaped produce will stay nice and banana-fresh.<br>      * To tear a banana in half, pierce the skin half-way along its length with a fingernail. Do it just enough to snap the fibers, so you'll be making a cut about half an inch long. Gently bend the banana away from the cut and the whole fruit should tear in half with no mess or bruising at all.<br>      * The peels are slippery.<br>      * For some reason some people feel bloated or have a big stomach when just eating half of a banana. Make sure you know who you are. You will feel like gas is in your stomach even if you didn't eat anything or not that much. It is really weird and not all people have this though.|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	OM NOM NOM|`|i0jVqB0Gaa	i like to eat bananas in many ways <br>  <br>  1 peel it eat it<br>  2 i add it in/on my pancakes<br>  3 i put it in fruit salad<br>  4 i eat it cut up and dried<br>  5 i put it in my peanut butter sandwich<br>  6 i put it in my smoothies<br>  7 i put it in my muffins <br>  8 i put it in banana bread<br>  9 when i was in a different country i drank milk from a small carton and in the ingredients it said that there was banana in it<br>  <br>  now isnt that alot of ways to eat and drink bananas!!<br>  now isn't that alot of ways to eat bananas (and drink)|`|4763cbf8c73d2cc7f8d102e43edfee1daa	1st: peel da peel<br>  2nd: put ur mouth on it<br>  3rd: close ur mouth<br>  4th: swallow<br>  5th: repeat until gone<br>  6th: throw away peel|`|lnAiP4Q2aa	Normally, I cut the ends off of the bannana, then its easier to peal. Peal back the skin and make sure their aren't many bruses on it- that means its going to taste bad.

I'm trying to 'change-it-up' and cook a little lighter with foods that cook faster, rather than the usual 2 hr, slow roasting winter foods.  I'm really enjoying my mayo, lettuce and cucumber stuffed pitas for lunch, throw in some iced tea and I'm feeling a bit of spring fever.  I'm also loving the avocados right now too.

wbZp6ZcPaa	"Margarine is made from vegetable oils, so it contains no cholesterol. Margarine is also higher in "good" fats — polyunsaturated and monounsaturated — than butter is. These types of fat help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad," cholesterol, when substituted for saturated fat. Butter, on the other hand, is made from animal fat, so it contains cholesterol and high levels of saturated fat.<br>  <br>  But not all margarines are created equal — and some may even be worse than butter. Most margarines are processed using a method called hydrogenation, which results in unhealthy trans fats. In general, the more solid the margarine, the more trans fats it contains — so stick margarines usually have more trans fats than do tub margarines. Like saturated fats, trans fats increase blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In addition, trans fats can lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol levels.<br>  <br>  When selecting a margarine, choose one with the lowest trans fat content possible and less than 2 grams total of saturated plus trans fats. Manufacturers are required to list saturated and trans fats separately on food labels. Also, margarines fortified with plant sterols can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels by more than 10 percent. The amount of daily plant sterols needed for results is at least 2 grams. The American Heart Association recommends foods fortified with plant sterols for people with levels of LDL cholesterol over 160 milligrams per deciliter (4.1 mmol/L).<br>  <br>  However, if you don't like the taste of margarine and don't want to give up butter completely, consider using whipped butter or light or reduced-calorie butter. There are also spreadable butters with vegetable oils added. Per serving, these products have less fat and calories than regular butter. The important thing is to use these products in small amounts — just enough to add flavor to the foods you're eating." - <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/butter-vs-margarine/AN00835" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/butter-...</a><br>  <br>  "Traditionally, the word shortening referred to any solid fat, including butter, lard, and suet — some or all of which are not appropriate for you. But nowadays, when you see the word shortening in a recipe, it is referring to a solid fat made from vegetable oil. Hydrogenating the oil, that is, adding hydrogen gas to it at a high temperature and pressure, is what transforms it from a liquid at room temperature to a solid. Vegetable shortening is flavorless." <a href="http://www.ochef.com/698.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ochef.com/698.htm</a>

64a4NB15aa	White flour : is whole wheat with the chaff or graham removed and often bleached to be white .<br>  Whole wheat : is exactly that . It is the wheat berry in the natural chafe and graham intact for the milling process and does not get bleached .<br>  Multi grain : this is flour made up of no less than four different cereal     grains milled and blended together in their natural state chafe intact and unbleached <br>  Your next question is not totally as simple as gluten content (protein )<br>  Yes bread flour must be milled of wheat varieties known for their high content of gluten . This is necessary for the yeast to react and give it rise .<br>  Cake and all purpose flour have an equal amount of gluten content . The difference between the two is the milling process . All purpose and hotel restaurant flour are neutral milling processes so it can have multi uses in any baking or cooking process . This is usually heavier and more dense . Cake flour is milled to a finer fluffier texture which is necessary to give a good cake recipe that lighter than air sponge to it .<br>  If you are making pastry or pie dough pastry flour is what you should use . Dutch milled pastry is the best if you can find it in your market .|`|TQCSwCpQaa	I'll try to answer your second question.  The difference between cake, all-purpose and bread flour is the amount of protein.  For bread, you need to develop gluten which helps to give the dough structure.  Cake four, though, is low in protein so that you get something that is light, but low in gluten and not chewy like bread needs to be. All-purpose is, obviously, right in the  middle.  So, the answer is protein levels and the ability to produce gluten.

16XpYCBmaa	No lettuce will not make you gain weight. It is very healthy for you and good for your health. The ice burg lettuce is not very nutritional, the romaine lettuce is the best. So have yourself a salad with lettuce,cucumbers,tomatoes and even add a little shredded cheese and add whatever dreesing you desire.|`|i2GRGLIpaa	Lettuce and other vegetables and fruit are pretty much made up of water and fiber. Foods with high water content actually keep you full longer. But before you try iceberg lettuce in your salad, try other, darker greens. The darker the vegetable the more vitamins it has. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the only sort of weight you may gain from lettuce is "water weight". So go for it.|`|GksSFTcVaa	No. As the fibers inside the lettuce soak in moisture, it loses most of its original mass.

If you stay at a place where your friends are smoking weed, and the police bust in, they will take everyone to the police station, you included, whether you used or not, just because you were there. Guilty by association. You may not want to believe me because that wouldn't be "fair", but it's all true and that's just the way it is. You did try to stop them here, but if you know people who smoke weed on a regular basis then you know how it seems to make them into people who really don't care about what anyone else thinks. So, like Bill M said, Leave.<br>  <br>  Edit: OK SPH, telling a young 16 year old girl to smoke weed, which by the way is illegal, is harmful to minors IMO. You don't tell a 16 year old to go out and do illegal stuff, it's like leading her to do something she can get into legal trouble for. Just plain dumb.<br>  <br>  Edit Again: How'd I know she was 16? - Another Post of hers:<br>  "Ok my birthday is coming up! Sweet 16!?<br>  My birthday is the 17 of October!

Using marijuana moderately can in fact be good for you. Abusing any drug is bad. For the person who said you can overdose on marijuana; no you cannot, it is physically impossible to. The LD50 (lethal dose) is about 1000 pounds smoked in a matter of minutes, compared to alcohol, which can sometimes be even 7 drinks for some. Alcohol, which is a a drug, a hard drug at that, is much more dangerous than marijuana. Alcohol kills thousands each year, makes users do stupid things, makes them aggressive. Other than the legal repercussions for using marijuana, there is no reason to why you shouldn't use it rather than alcohol.|`|wfmreO95aa	if they like it they are gonna do it. almost all of my friends smoke..ill join them sometimes its not that bad. it wont hurt them

0dbbb948636ec1c95b44b9e48d12e2cfaa	In the United States oats were viewed as nothing more than horse feed until a German grocer named Ferdinand Schumacher emigrated to the United States in the mid-1800s and saw a ready market for oatmeal in the growing immigrant population. In 1854, Schumacher began grinding oats in his Akron, Ohio, store, using a hand mill similar that used to grind coffee beans. Within two years he opened the German Mills American Oatmeal Company. Using a water wheel to generate power and rotate two large millstones, Schumacher's business was able to fill twenty 180 lb (81.7 kg) barrels with oatmeal daily. Oats were hulled by passing them between two stone wheels turning in opposite directions. The hulls and residue were sifted out of the oat grains, which are known as groats. The groats were crushed under a second set of millstones, producing a meal that could be eaten after it was cooked for three to four hours. But there was still enough powdery residue in the groats that the cooked oatmeal was pasty and lumpy.<br>  <br>  Today the groats are coarsely ground to make oatmeal, or cut into small pieces to make steel-cut oats, or are first steamed, then flattened to make rolled oats. The quick-cooking rolled oats ("quick oats") are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. "Instant" oatmeal is pre-cooked and dried, usually with sweetener and flavor additives|`|53giV6PFaa	The oats (grains) no longer grows once it has been separated from the plant.   Oatmeal is a dish made from oat groats.  The groats are coarsely ground to make oatmeal, or cut into small pieces to make steel-cut oats, or are first steamed, then flattened to make rolled oats. The quick-cooking rolled oats ("quick oats") are cut into small pieces before being steamed and rolled. "Instant" oatmeal is pre-cooked and dried, usually with sweetener and flavor additives|`|36a3ynpJaa	Oats look like barley before they are processed. They are steamed to soften them and then they are put through rollers to flatten them.  This is why they are called rolled oats.|`|thoMmZAvaa	Most oatmeal is steamed, cut and/or rolled and dried. Steel cut groats (irish oatmeal) are steamed and cut only, they require overnight soaking and significantly longer cooking times. Oatmeal as we know it (rolled oats) is dried and rolled and takes about 5-10 minutes to cook (depending how you cook them). Quick oats (or any small package oatmeal) are rolled oats that have been chopped down, they cook in about a minute or two and can be easily microwaved. All in all it's pretty close to it's natural state in most cases, obviously the more processing the further it is away (and usually not the sole ingredient anymore).

hBBQZ6yDaa	I love Olivie, but I make it differently though it's not Russian in origin - we adopted it from the French.

Most cows never get abused while being milked, and it actually relieves them.

Bad things will happen. BUT:<br>  Yes, cows are abused. To the employees and milk company owners, cow=money, not cow=living, breathing, feeling thing.<br>  To make cows produce milk, they are artificially impregnated, then soon after their calf's birth, it is taken away and sold as veal. This is mental abuse. The cows and calves cry for each other for days, as they are very closely linked. <br>  Milking cows receive little to no veternary care, so their udders are all mess up, inflamed, and very painful.<br>  Also: Vegan is very healthy if you do it right. <br>  Cheese is basically bacteria and spoiled milk: Very bad.<br>  Milk is linked to prostate cancer.<br>  Milk can actually contain puss from infected udders.

Baby cows stop nursing after two years (cow's milk is so fatty they quadruple their size in that time!), then eat grass on there own.  When a mammal lactates they produce a different balance of hormones which puts the brain in "mothering mode", and I for one wouldn't want my body to be trapped in that hormone wash for my entire life....its just not following the creature's natural life cycle.|`|LywQYxDsaa	<a href="http://www.vegan-nutritionista.com/vegan-cheese.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegan-nutritionista.com/vegan...</a><br>  <br>  I have a whole review on dairy-free cheeses here, including pictures of the labels and places you can find them.

In a large bowl, mix the Muenster, mild and sharp Cheddar, and Monterey Jack cheeses. To the macaroni, add the half-and-half, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded cheese, the cubed Velveeta, and the eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer to the buttered casserole. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheese and dot with the remaining one tablespoon of butter.<br>  <br>  Bake until it's bubbling around the edges, about 35 minutes. Serve hot.

k6eJO1Iraa	E' stato dimostrato che anche la forma influisce sul gusto e quindi sull'appetibilità di un prodotto. Con una forma ed uno spessore diverso, le diverse sfumature di sapori e di aromi sono distribuiti in maniera diversa e quindi sono percepiti in maniera diversa dal palato. Un buon contributo lo dà certamente anche l'atmosfera di festa che ispira la confezione e gli stessi prodotti, oltre, naturalmente, al magico effetto del Natale che rende allegri e mette appetito (chissà perchè si ingrassa durante le feste?!?). L'effetto è maggiore se li si gusta in compagnia...|`|2S4qt3Bkaa	hihi ti stavo scrivendo la spiegazione poi ho visto ke l'hai già data!!!
