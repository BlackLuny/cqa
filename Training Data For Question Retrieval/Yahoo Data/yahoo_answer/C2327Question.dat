Maybe I ENJOYED being asleep for so long, and I actually am fond of the thirteenth fairy.    3. Maybe I KNEW that I was going to prick my finger on the spinning wheel, before I turned fifteen.   4. Maybe I'm ANGRY at my parents for not inviting the thirteenth witch?   5. Maybe I wasn't really sleeping?   6. Maybe I was ANGRY to be woken up, because I didn't really fall in love with the prince?   7. Maybe I didn't really live 'happily ever after'. Maybe the witch came back for me.    8. Maybe the fairy that saved me from the thirteenth fairy's witch is actually my enemy for some reason?   9. Maybe I did not appreciate the other fairys wishes for some reason?   10. Maybe the good old woman spinning the wheel in the attic really DID know about the curse   11. Maybe I was a spoiled brat, and the fairys only gave me nice wishes because my father, the king, BRIBED them.

Okay obviously I'm not going to show my whole speech, and obviously I'm going to summerize in point form that conclusion, but is that conclusion okay?         Though it is true that the color of your parents eyes plays a big role in determining what color eyes you end up with, it isn’t the only factor. The genes that were passed on to them, will be passed on to you. So if you’ve still wondering how you ended up with blue eyes when both your parents have brown, or vice versa it is because your parents both carry a gene for blue eyes, and you inherited both. Predicting what color eyes a child will have is next to impossible, even though we know  brown is dominant, and that genes come in pairs, one from the mother, and one from the father it. There are countless combinations.

I recieved $4,000 after my tuition and fees. i used that money to pay to books, supplies, a laptop, and a car b/c i was riding the train to school.   So what should i do, my taxes are already sent and filed, and i am afraid me and my father might get in trouble. Should i call and explain this simple mistake, or what.   P.S. i am having trouble about filling out my FASFA b/c it said Scholarships and Grants reported on your tax returns, but my problem is that it wasnt reported. So what do i put there, i know i should wait. but the longer i wait, the less money i get back from the school b/c the aid goes out fast!

I have been accepted to the three colleges I narrowed it down to, but when is the best time to decide? After you get your financial aid packages and know where you're going to get the best deal? The thing is, of the three, there's really only one I REALLY want to go to....should I just send it the form saying I want to go there, or wait for the award letter saying how much they're going to give me? I've already gotten a $20,000 per year scholarship, but at a $47,000 per year school, that doesn't really do me much good. Should I wait? I just want to be able to say, "I'm going to _______!!!" But I also want to see what other schools offer me. One of my schools already sent the award letter, and I'd have to pay about $13,000 per year (out of $43,000), which is kinda a lot....But it's a private college, and so is the one i really want to go to. The last school is a State school, and i dont really want to go there. So, what should I do? Wait for the financial aid package of my top school, or just say, I'm going there! HELLPPPP!!!

20090223154935AAJ0gO4	Education & Reference;Teaching	Should I complain about my English teacher?	Although having been predicted A*s for my English and English Literature GCSE, my new English teacher isn't giving our class good enough notes to write an essay on. He gave us only 35 minutes to do a practice paper instead of 60, using the reason that he gave us "planning time" beforehand. As if we would use 25 minutes planning anyway. He made us do 2 assessed practice papers in which I achieved a grade D- and C-. He does not always plan lessons and gives us too much "gimmicky" group work when we don't have the time to be messing around. He also keeps jumping around when giving us notes on poems, and doesn't give as in depth information as other classes. We have 1 top set class and 3 mixed ability classes, and being in a mixed ability class, I don't feel I can work to my full potential. I have another English teacher I have half the time.    I was thinking of telling the English teacher in concern, because then he might change his ways. Or should I speak to my other English teacher? What should I say? Should I go with other people who feel the same way (I'm not the only one). I feel the first option may be best because then we're not going behind his back? Oh, I really don't know?!
