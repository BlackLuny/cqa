20090220072931AAIsKzt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Almost 39 weeks, doctor said baby was in a very weird position?	Just got back from my appointment   My doctor actually had to get another doctor to come in because she said she never seen a baby lay like that   They did an ultrasound, and hes laying on his side but his face is up   So what does this mean?   Could he turn?   Do you think I'll have back labor?
20090220072939AA5lzfr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	These Aren't Pregnancy Signs Are They?	I know I need to go to the gyno for this and I plan on it. I just have to wait a couple of weeks for my insurance to kick in but I just need some sort of idea. Ok, Yesterday when I went to the bathroom a had some pink spotting on the tissue. It lasted for several hours and disappeared. Then last night when I wiped myself the pink was bank again and then later turned to brown. Now it's gone again. I feel bloated (not as bad as yesterday) and I was cramping yesterday. I keep having mild headaches and my body aches (although that could be from excessive excercise). I have also been ridiculously hungry for the past few days. I am pretty much experiencing period symptoms but my period was just over 9 days ago. I have been having unprotected sex with my bf but if I calculated correctly my ovulation time didn't start until Sunday 2/15 and he pulls out everytime (I know it's not 100% effective). Any ideas what it could be. I thought maybe ovulation spotting, even though I have never experienced that but what's up with the other symptoms? Thanks so much!   One more thing...My friends all said it looks like I'm losing a little weight and for the past two days I was extremely tired but last night I kept waking up and couldn't get back to sleep for a long time.
20090220073009AARN2Tz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it ok to ask my doctor to have a c-section at 36 weeks?	I am going to have a 5th c-section, and I was advised by a medical professional who knows about labor and delivery to try and have my c-section at 36 or 37 weeks. This person was afraid of uterine rupture and that is why they advised me to do it.They are just trying to look out for me and the baby. Is this a good idea to follow through on?

I really am not sure if my cycles are 29 or 30 days so it might be in 3 days, but yesterday I had what could have been implantation bleeding, one little drop of light brown... so that was 10 or 11 dpo and 3 or 4 days before AF, and I never get AF that early. Also AF is really red.      So NOW can I test? Will it be more accurate after that little drop yesterday?      After implantation the cells divide so shouldn't I have HcG if its been 24 hours?

So, I've already decided that I would like to pierce my baby's ears, but I don't know when the best time would be.  Someone told me that I could have them pierced at the hospital, after she's born, but that seems a tad bit too soon.  I was thinking around six months or so.  However, I've also heard that it getting it done at the hospital is the safest most sanitary way...      Has anyone else pierced their daughter's ears at the hospital?  How did it turn out?  Who would I ask about that (my doctor, a nurse...)?      Has anyone had their daughter's ears pierced after 6 months?  Where did you have it done?

My little girl, Stevie, has been throwing a fit since she woke up at 8 am.  She has been crying, screaming, and rolling around in the floor.  When I pick her up to comfort her she rolls around, pushing on me like she doesn't want to be bothered.  I had a really hard time getting her to eat breakfast and she just started sipping on her juice.  She doesn't want me to play with her or hold her.  Is this normal?  Is she already into the terrible twos?  Or could something be wrong?  At the moment she is standing beside me laughing at her cup of juice.  As soon as I say something to her or touch her, she gets really temperamental.  Should I be concerned?  She was born 3 months early, so developmentally she is a little behind and acts more like a 17 month old.

I've tried putting them away and trying to redirect him toward his toys - no interest. Should I be concerned and when will this annoying behavior end?  PS...I've bought all kinds of toys geared toward building, taking apart and anything else you can think of.

I talked to my Dr. and got on pre-natal vitamins and starting counting the ovulation days (between the 14th and the 16th) but havent gotten pregnant. My OBGYN said that if we do not get pregnant by next November (1 year) than we can look into other options (which is scary in itself).

My 19 month old does not speak, only babbles, he has never pointed at an object, he walks on his tip toes, spins around and around, and hand flaps, he puts everything in his mouth.He will look sometimes when I call his name, but most times he does not. He doesn't mimic ie: spoon for eating, or brush for brushing hair, he does not use toys as they are intended to be played with, if he has a truck he will throw it instead of pushing it or spin the wheels on it. He will open and shut cabinet doors over and over again. On a different note, He has wonderful sense of humor, he laughs at things such as peek a boo, chase, and tickling. He has great eye contact and will move my face to look at him. He knows the meaning of some words such as No and Come here, Juice, Milk. He will hum songs such as "This old man". He has a ride on car and got on it the first day and mastered it. He talks A lot but not real words, gibberish. My gut tells me this is Autism, and why do people make it out so bad? He is a great loving kid, he loves to pat me and hug me and give me kisses, loves for me to hold him. I know this is a spectrum disorder, in your opinion where would he fall on it? Sorry this is so long, I appreciate any feedback
20090220075048AA9LXQ9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did i do the right thing !?	dear all ,i would appreciate your feed back . i need some reassurance whether i did the right thing .please read on .   It all started when my 38yrs old unmarried sister in-law moved to live next door . the main reason was to leave her parents before they die .. as she thinks she should leave them before they leave her . just to give u an idea, her parents are slaves to her .they do what ever she wants ,since she used to have a medical nervous condition !   at the beginning ,i thought i could fix things , like i can be a sister and listen to her ..and an abnormal relationship started ! a relationship based on her nagging to me while i give her solutions . ( i bet that is what she did to her mom! i see her turning us into slaves ,giving my husband tasks to do around her house every now and then . she is around us everywhere we go (she doesn't have friends and never a single boyfriend) and to tell you the truth ,i have never met a more negative depressing person in my life !   i held on to the relationship for my husband's sake and because i pitied her and thought i could help !   the problem started when i gave birth to my daughter which made her around us all the time ..she says she feels like her mom since she felt her kicks in my tummy and since she knew her before she was born ..she feels , my daughter is going to be just like her and nag just like her ,and take the same antidepressants just like her,   she wants to feed her and mother her everyday !   once we went for a month's vacation ..she told me she can't live without seeing her !   so there she is every night after work , cuddling ,feeding and bonding with my new baby !   finally , i couldn't bear this anymore ! i tried gentle ways to tell her which ended in failure ..so i cracked up by telling her that she is very possessive ..and that she wants everything done for her ..and that she is obsessed with being the mother of my baby ! and that she wants my baby to be an extension of her !!   now ..we don't talk ! please tell me if i did the right thing ? i really don't need someone to put negative ideas in my child's head since day 1! would you have felt the same way ? or was i jealous of her bonding with my baby ?? i am really confused and feel guilty !   thank you
20090220075023AAngRLn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My 9 year old son is aggressive and has hit me and is starting to hit my 3 year old son.  PLEASE HELP!!?	My son has a history of being abused.  I have divorced his biological father, as I call him the "sperm donor" and he has now been adopted by my new husband.  We have been through counseling and meds and he still continues to be aggressive.  He is doing poorly in school with classmates, hitting and pinching them, and not wanting to do any work getting D's and F's on all papers.  ( I have thought about home schooling him, but I don't think I could handle him at home doing that.)  He is an outstanding wrestler rating 4th in Ohio but this year, he has no will to keep wrestling any more.  He has given up on everything and just won't listen.  He gets mad when he is told 'NO' on anything that it most of the time results in him hitting me and I just take it.  I do NOT encourage hitting as a form of punishment at all because of everything he has been through.  His most recent fit resulted in one of my ribs being kicked out of place and a right hook on my face.  He is starting to hit on his 3 year old brother more than normal brotherly stuff.  I HAVE to put a stop to this and break his cycle of hitting and being so mean all the time to every one.  I don't know what else to do.  The counselors have told me that meds can fix him.  I even had a counselor tell me that he didn't need conseling.  His doctor is telling me that he will just be this way and hitting is a reflex because of him being abused from when he was 9 months old until he was 2.  Can anyone PLEASE give me some guidance and advice?

20090203125025AAdXC9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	A question about the mom who had the octuplets..?	I have heard so much about this story that I decided it was my turn to ask a question on this nonsense. We all know she already had six children, and she just gave birth to 8...and that there is no way she can support all of them and that she wants her on tv show and I think it's quite pathetic. But don't people think it's a bit like Jon and Kate who had their sextuplets. I mean Jon and Kate have a tv show which when the babies were young, it was cute to see how they did it, but they're in preschool and the cameras should be out of their home by now, in my opinion. Jon and Kate are married, have a house and seem to make a good living but this Octuplet mom just hit a nerve with me. And what's with Jon and Kate who keep doing the tv show just for the money and this octuplet mom wanting her own tv show, are people that desperate.

Today we all had the day off from the snow and she stayed in bed all day while I was at their house (she's seemed okay other days). It got to the early evening and we realized that she had locked herself in her bedroom (an actual key lock, not just a lock), turned her phone off and we couldn't get hold of her.       My boyfriend was going to go and knock on her bedroom door at six-thirty but he asked me to leave so he could have the space to sort her out. I am very worried. It is now nine pm and I want to call to see if she is okay but I don't want to get in the way of any deep talks they might be having (this woman talks for hours). Should I call now or leave them to it for a while longer?

20090203125422AAzgRW2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Should i contact the parents?	My 15 year old daughter attended a surprise 16th birthday party for her friend.  The parents were there the whole time.  Three junior boys ended up doing a strip tease act down to a g-string thong (with there butt exposed and all) to the birthday girl.  My daughter video taped the whole thing and I can see the father of the birthday girl sitting in the back ground watching everything.  Infact, the boys danced over by the father and the father picked up a fireplace poker and broke the string on one of the boys g-strings.  Some of the girls I believe got an extra show.  The father also helps coach the wrestling team that they are on.  I have not called the parents direct.  I might have annon. leaked out info to other parents and/or to the school.  But should I bother contacting the parents to give them a piece of my mind?  The only reason I haven't as of now is because of my daughter... I don't want her to deal with it through the kids at school because of me.  What would you do?

Do they WANT to have the responsibility of raising a child at such a young age (I just saw a 14-year-old with the username "Due 4/5" or something like that, which made me even more worried about these people)? It's absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. Could all you teen mothers tell me why you feel proud of yourselves for ruining your childhood? I'd really like to know your opinion.

20090220093705AAihRuT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you give your baby's stuff away, or do you sell them?	I have a friend who had a baby after mine, so I have been giving them all of my babies clothes, bassinet, bottles, slings, etc. They have offered me money but I would feel really ackward taking it and don't know how much to ask for or take. Well now I am selling his crib and changing table, and all the furniture which was used only a few times so I can get the set that I really like, but my friend kind of thinks I should just give her that whole set, like $800 worth of furniture. I was actually going to sell it on ebay. She said I will give you like a $100 for it. It is worth a lot more. I don't want to hurt a friendship, but it is my fault for just giving all of that stuff away without ever taking money. I don't know what to tell her without hurting her feelings.

20090220084032AAFhNzV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	When did you have your implantation Bleeding?	I ovulated some time last weekend either Fri Sat or Sun. My hubby and I had sex on Fri, I had lots of jelly like CM. Then I got blood tinged CM on the tissue when I went to the bathroom on Wed night (more brown)and Thurs morning (more pinkish red). I am wondering when your implantation bleeding happened for you? Can it happen this early? With my son I got one tiny pink spot on the tissue the day before I tested pos. Do you think implantation or just the blood from the shed ovum? I will be fine either way.My son is 1 and we would love to be pregnant again but wouldn't mind wating a little longer either. Whats your take?

I know this may sound crazy but I had bought Xanden a pack of wipes to go in his diaper bag. They are huggies cucumber melon scented. Then I reached the point where I go number 2 a lot and thought they may make me feel better and then I also got worried about the scent (i hadn't thought of it before) So i decided i would use that pack and get him new unscented ones. Well, a couple days after using them My skin down there in between my legs (i used them there for freshness) Got raw and burned and hurt really badly! I figure its gotta be from the wipes! So then i used his destinin cream stuff - which by the way STINKS! - but works - my "rash" is gone!       I feel silly! Anyone else have such an experience?

20090220082609AAKXT94	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What would you do in this situation?	I am a stay mom of a 3yr old. I babysit this little girl who just turned 4 yesterday. Here is my problem, the little girl that I babysit had kicked  my daughter(on her left side) out of the recliner. Needless to say she was crying & told me that her arm hurts. So, I took her to the Emergency Room & they did an X-Ray. The doctor came in & told me that there was Good & Bad News. The bad news is that her collarbone was broken. The good news was that it wasn't broken into. The doctor said that it wasn't anything that they could do because it'll heal on its own. They said that she'll be in a great deal of pain for awhile & suggested that she should take Motrin. They gave her a sling that she has to wear during the day. Well, I called the father of the little girl & told him what had happened & I'm sure that he had called the mother & told her. I had called him back & left a message asking him to go by the store to pick up some Motrin, I told him that he could take it out of my pay, if he wanted to, but considering that your child had done this mine its the least that you could do. Well, he called back & said that he couldn't get it because he had ice cream cake in the car. I feel as though they the parents of this little girl laughed about what had happened, that's how they are. I feel so angry & disgusted because these people claim to be my best friends, but neither of them apologized. If this would've happened to their little girl I would've apologize, & asked if there was anything that I could do to Help. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I know the little girl didn't mean for my daughters collarbone  to break, but it happened. The parents know that my kids have Medicaid, & I guess they feel as though they don't need to help. How would you handle this. The babysitting $ pays for my girls dance classes.Please Help! I am not after in suing, I am not that type of person, I just wish that these people would have the decency to do what is right.

20090220083114AAOmkAc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	As a parent what are your expectations from your child?	I was brought up in a very sheltered environment and have always been an obedient and studious child. I did good in school. college etc and now am successfully employed. So far I was the epitome if proper child to my parents ...as they kept telling me how proud they are of me.      I moved away from home...fell in love and got married to a guy I had know for 4 years. He is also educated, responsible caring loving...all!. he was raised in a different religion. The 4 years I knew him...I questioned my beliefs etc...to make sure what I felt and if I was ready to commit, and I was.       Ever since the day I told my parents I wanted to marry him...their attitude towards me changed completely. They told me that marrying him was the biggest mistake I could make...and how they never expected me to do so...and how difficult it would be for them to accept this.      We got married anyways and every time I talk to my Mom or Dad they will say something to put my husband down. Its so disheartening to see this. My husband thinks that they just need more time and when they see how happy we are they will come to terms with it.      Sometimes I feel that I was too harsh on them...that I was too selfish  . I love them but I don,t fell i did anything wrong.      So as a parent what are your expectations from your child...if you had been in my parents place would you feel the same way too?

20090220090500AAOKTDd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I Possibly Be Pregnant?	Ok, so I looked at one of those WebMD ovulation calculators and it said that my most fertile time for ovulation was 2/11-2/14 and that ovulation probably started around 2/15. I had sex every day (sometimes more than once) between those days. I did three different calculators and the latest I was most fertile was 2/12. The reason why is because on 2/19 I experienced some pink spotting and today a little brown spotting that has stopped. I am achy all over, bloated feeling, tired, very hungry and irritable and emotional (ask my friends) LOL. My bf pulled out everytime but now I'm thinking it wasn't as effective as I had hoped. Could I possibly be preggo? My last period was all weird acting (extremely early and longer than usual).

20090220091033AA5jeN4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 1 year old is not sleeping as well lately... is it his teeth or just changing schedule?	My 1 year old has slept 12 (or more) hours a night since he was 4 months.  Since we eliminated his evening cat nap a month or two ago, he has been going to bed between 7 and 730, and then getting up at 8 (I know, it's wonderful!).  Once in a while, he won't want a morning nap, but usually he sleeps 1 1/2 hours in the morning, and about the same in the afternoon (goes down around 10 and 2 or 230).  The last couple of weeks, he has been more restless at night, and getting up as early as 6.  This just isn't like him, and I just was wondering if you think it's teething (which he is!) or that I need to get him down to one nap.  Or both.  Has anyone else had this happen?  Any feedback would be great!  Thanks!

My question is, why am I just looking fat and when will it stop?! :(  Or how can I not be so emo about other woman as far along as I am looking beautiful and definitely preggo.  If I have one more person tell me oh, I didn't realize you were pregnant, are you sure?  I am going to cry!  Of course I am sure!!

20090220092218AAxK6Hj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	6 month old suddenly waking often at night?	My 6 month old daughter has been sleeping through the night for about 2 months.  She might wake and stir a little, but she wouldn't start crying.  Last night, we put her down for bed at around 6:30 like usual.  By 8:30 she was up screaming (we normally wake her for another feed around 9:30 so she can make it until 6 the next morning).  So, I fed her and put her back to bed.  I went to bed, but my hubby stayed up and she woke up at 10:45 and again at 11:30.  She finally woke up again at midnight and he woke me up so I could feed her.  At about 1am, she went back to sleep in her crib and slept until we had to wake her to get ready for daycare.  What could be going on?  We had a growth spurt a few weeks ago, but I didn't think she could have another one so quickly.  She doesn't have a fever or anything.  We have started rice cereal with breast milk for over a week, but she gets most of her nutrition still from breast milk.  Any ideas?

I read so many on other questions in this category that it gets annoying. I just want you to impart your knowledge on this subject! Thanks and God Bless!!!

20090220090207AA3qjCs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding questions?	I am 30 weeks pregnant and I have decided to breast feed. I am getting a lot of weird reactions from people when I tell them this. My two neighbors are also pregnant and they are bottle feeding their babies with formula (which is completely fine with me) because they get WIC and welfare and free formula and they say that breastfeeding is disgusting and it hurts too bad.   Okay, I dont understand how any pregnant woman can think breastfeeding is nasty?! I understand some people cant/dont want to but to tell me that I am nasty because I want to nurse my child? I was astounded. It is natural and more healthy for my child and myself. I know it will probably h urt at first but as of right now I am adamant about nursing my child and pushing through the pain because it for the benefit of my child.      Do a lot of people think like that breastfeeding is gross and nasty? Even if they do I am not going to change my mind I just have never thought I would get yelled at/picked on/name called because I decided to  breast feed =(   Also they brought up a point about what about when I cant be home to nurse, I told them that I planned on pumping my breastmilk and having it bottle fed to my child and they said that it is not the same and you cant say you are breastfeeding exclusively if you pump for bottles. I only planned on doing this in an emergency as I will be staying for home for the first year.Also, I got attacked on the subject of breastfeeding in public. I think it is perfectly fine if it is done in a descreet and respectful way...      Does anyone agree with these women? I am very upset about their reactions.

20090220090119AAQzPsi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would I be eligible for Medicaid?	My husband wants to start a business. If we do this, he will lose his employer's insurance coverage. If I am pregnant in the near future, would I be eligible for Medicaid to cover the birth since he will be technically unemployed because business start-ups are hard and all businesses take a while to generate great revenue?       So, instead of paying $200 a month for private insurance for myself and then a huge deductible for the future birth, I had Medicaid in mine. After all, we've been paying into it all of these years and we would use it just for the birth.       Thank you for your help.

20090220084429AAFturN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant? 2 weeks 2 days- 2 weeks 6 days scan showed thickness of uterus?	ok here goes. Had miscarriage 6 mths ago. Since then periods been a little irregular. Period due 11 th Feb, felt preg few days before. Had few faint positive results. THEN..... started bleeding on 12th Feb, moderate flow for 48 hrs then spotting for another couple of days (very unlike my usual heavy periods)Repeated test-big fat NEGATIVE!! Went drs, referred for scan. Had scan today.Lady who did scan said no evidence of pregnancy inside uterus HOWEVER my uterus measuring at 11 mm thick which either means early miscarriage OR too early in pregnancy to see a sac... so she wanted to scan me again in 7 days. She said if this a healthy pregnancy the uterus will at least be a little thicker by then even if still no sac to see. So one way or other she will know if pregnancy continuing. Well spoke to midwife after the scan who did a urine test which was again a big fat NEGATIVE but she not altogether convinced of that result as my periods have been a little irregular and Ive still got pregnancy symptoms, so she has taken some blood to check for HCG levels, results on Monday. I did ask the midwife why I would have several positive results then some negatives. She said could be early miscarriage  but she doesnt altogether trust negative urine results and would rather do bloods to be sure.She said depending on level of HCG she may take more blood Monday but if levels low she said I dont need another scan. Any1 else been through something similar? Whats the chance of this being a healthy pregnancy?I know I need to wait on the blood results but Im really anxious and holding on to any bit of hope. Please reply if you think you can shred abit of light for me.Thanx....

20090220095647AASoaBw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Ok, what could be causing this?  its starting to get worse...?	our son is almost 8 months old.  At 2 1/2 months old we changed his formula b/c of GERD and lactose intollorance.  Since then he's been doing really good with his formula...up till the last month though.  He has started spitting up after all of his bottles everyday and when he spits up its really soured/spoiled smelling...TMI, but it honestly smells worse than somebody puking after a night of bar hopping...its terrible.  Its probably 1/2 ounce per 7 1/2 ounce bottle that gets spit up.      He burps really good after all of his bottles, I haven't given him anything new food wise here lately...he's just been having baby food that he's been getting since about 4 months old.  He knows if I try to "short" him on his bottles by reducing how much he gets...anything less than 7 1/2 ounces doesn't seem to fill him up.      He has to get another dose of medication Monday from the doctor's office so I'm fixing to get on the phone to make an actual appointment for him so I can talk with his pediatrician and see if we can figure out what could be causing this.      Any ideas what could be causing him to spit up like he is and reasons for it to smell like it has been smelling?  i'm stuck here...      Oh, and he has finally settled back down some since he was having fits earlier this morning...
20090220101858AAfrYG8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	What Are Some Unique, Unusual, But Pretty, Latin, Greek or Italian Names For A Little Girl?	Basically, I'm writing a story, and in it there is this little girl, with bright blonde hair, with a reddish tint, and big blue eyes. She's quite unique, and unusual, and her parents saw this from the start, so they decided to choose a very unique, but pretty, name to go with her. Middle name suggestions would be great too, and they don't have to be as out there as her first name.       Her surname will be Whistle.       Any questions just ask, and also no rude answers. The person who I feel has got the name that seems to suit her best will get the 10 points.       G2B

20090220094511AAjlaLU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant and not sleeping! What can i do?	I'm 17 weeks pregnant, and although this is not a recent issue, the side effects are really catching up to me right now. I can't sleep! It doesnt matter what time i go to bed at, i'll normally fall asleep, wake up a few hours later (normally 3 to 4 hours later) and then i cant fall back asleep. I lay there in bed and try to fall back asleep and it just wont work.   So i get 3-4 hours of sleep a night, maximun 5 if im lucky and I am dead tired! They say that pregnant woman should try to get minimum 8 hours of sleep a night because they are splitting their energy with the baby, but im not getting even close to that, but no matter how tired i am, i still cant sleep...      Any idea what i need to do about this? Anything that can help you sleep?      Thanks.

I haven't spoken to her in about a year. My husband hates her too because of what all I've said bad about her. I feel bad, I really don't hate her. But she was pregnant at the time and a year has passed. I just recently had a baby too. She never called or anything while I was pregnant. suddently yesterday, I saw her and she talked my ear off then she said she had a gift for me and brought it up to me yesterday. I'm so confused. Why hadn't she talked to me in a year and then act all friendly to me. She even told me we ought to go eat out sometime. I almost started crying. I don't know whether I should believe her, I don't know if I should make the next move or what. Please help. What would you do???
20090220095324AADz9s2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My friend didn't even get me anything when my child was born!! Please read. Need honest answers.?	I had a friend, who had been a friend for 2 yrs. We did everything together. Her son and my daughter were the same age and they did alot together too. Her husband was friends with my husband. So we did this about 2 yrs. Then she got pregnant, and she changed. She told me I was getting on her nerves. She had her child in May, I've only seen her a couple of times since then. I, since then, got pregnant too. She never called or emailed me to ask how I was doing nor did she get me anything when my baby was born. I started a new job yesterday and out of the blue I saw her there (it was a daycare & she was dropping her child off). She actually came looking for me. She talked my ear off, told me we should do lunch, then said she had a gift for me and then she went home, got it & brought it to me yesterday afternoon when she picked her child up. I almost started crying. I don't know what to feel or think??? Why after a year is she acting like this? I mean, I want to be friends, I want to do something with her but, I don't know if I can trust her again. What should I do?????

20090220094844AAR8bDt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can she be in labour?	It's a bit long, but here goes: I live in a condo, rent, a postgraduate student. The neighbours next door own. There is a father, mother and two daughters. One is about 18-19, the other is about 13. The elder daughter went away to study or what not, and came back with a young man, big, huge fists like footballs, at least 6'6 tall, they got married, now she is pregnant. He does not work, leaves with his in-laws, gets about. The in-laws just redecorated the place, everything is new, down to big expensive plasma TV which the new bridegroom watches all the day long. He brings a lot of young females and they all shout on the stairs, and we endure. Now the in-laws are no good: he beats her, and kept beating her all the time, and swearing at her (so loudly I could hear as if in my own room). On the other hand, he is the main provider, and feed his wife, his both daughters and his son-in-law. His wife likes to invite friends in and have one drink too many. He likes to have one drink too many on his own, and then fights, swears and says that they "had driven him to the edge". The newly wed were given a bedroom just a wall from me. Today, at 1 a.m. they started fighting, he throwing heavy furniture at her and shouting that he was a man, so she had to obey. Today there is constant sound coming out of there, like "Ah!- ah! ah! ah" - frankly, to me just like a woman in labour from the documentaries. He seems to smoke on the stairs and laugh with some females. Now do you think she can be really in labour - her belly is big but I am not an expert - and all the others parting or what not?  On the other hand, maybe she is exercising beforehand, or how you  call it, you know training with the DVD on breathing or something?

20090220094553AAGwbKx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is sex behind the common trend of marriage and parenthood?	I have a feeling that given how things are these days it is probably not so much social pressure as it is romantic satisfaction the probably pushes people to marry and have kids and buy homes these days. Where I live that is what I have noticed as a trend. Lots of parents with children in the neighborhood or walking their babies in strollers in the park. It does seem interesting in a way that advertising is linked to satisfying romantic desires and then coping with the financial stress afterwards (buying cars, credit card debt, mortgaging homes, healthcare, education). It does seem quite interesting in a way although I know it's all a personal decision in the end since arranged marriage is not the custom here in the U.S. If it were I think the population would be way bigger than 300,000,000 though because of wanting to comply with the social acceptance of having lots of babies. It is interesting how here most of the focus is on having small families (I think for financial reasons) but in other countries India and maybe even Nigeria the emphasis is on having lots of children. I think the women who has the 14 kids would be very accepted over there because of the cultural custom of having large families is encouraged.
20090220094733AA94kg8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Have any of you parents dealt with sleepwalking children?	It happened to me for the 1st time last night. My almost 5 yr old son got out of bed, came to my room wide eyed, walked around and then walked out. I called out his name, but he was unresponsive. He then went to stand in the middle of the living room. Again I called out his name, and still nothing. He then proceeded to the bathroom when I noticed that he was peeing and walking! He completely soiled himself and the living room and bathroom floors. I kept calling his name and...nothing! So as he just stood there, I cleaned him up and changed his PJs and walked him back to bed. He went with no problem and fell back to a deep sleep immediately. This morning he asks me, Mommy why am I wearing different PJs?  He didn't remember anything.       Has anything like this happened to you and what should I do about it happening in the future?      Thank you

20090220101139AASR44S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Why is my son being held back simply because the others in his class aren't as advanced?	Every few weeks we get one of those Scholastic book order flyers and we'd love to get him some books, as a couple of the other kids get some and he doesn't like to be left out...The thing is this: He's in Grade 2 but reads at a level way higher, ie Grade 5 or 6. The school goes up to Grade 6 and we asked if one of the flyer from those classes could be given to him to choose from.   They won't do it, citing the 'reason'(a cover their a$$es excuse I say) that the lists need to be grouped according to age and grade...and that he shouldn't be singled out, as it might make him or others feel self-conscious about  reading skills.   WE don't want to stop ordering books, but the books they approve of, he'd read through in 10 minutes if that...and we don't want to order 40 books just so he has a weekend's reading.      Why is it that kids need to be so rigidly grouped by age and not by individual ability...(we also had a heck of a time getting him math assignments that were up to his ability as well, because that would mean actually dealing with him as a person and not as a Grade 2er.)

I took two of the Clear blue easy ( non digital ) BOTH OF THEM showed a faint line RIGHT AWAY! ( DID NOT READ IT WRONG )  I then took First response and it was negative!   So, This morning I started spotting brown, which is now my Full blown period! I know I was NEVER pregnant because I went to my doctor.    Im pretty upset that I trusted this test!  I was told a + is just that.. well for those of you who have had luck with them, I haven't!   I did not have a chemical pregnancy, because it did not show up in my blood test. I did not have a miscarriage because I was checked for that too!   SO Just be warned about this type of test!

Long story short, he came in the condom (outside of me). We both weren't satisfied so he put on another.    We kept going, and then he soft (too tired) he pulled out and says... "Oh I hope I didn't get *** on the outside of this condom."    ^ But I'm, not sure how he could have gotten *** on the outside of the condom in the first place.       Anyways.... I'm majorly paranoid. My mom already knows, but she doesn't think I'm pregnant.       Is there a pregnancy test that I can take now? Or do I have to wait 3 weeks?

But, I'm petrified. I've been pregnant 2 times already. Possibly three times, but I didn't go to the doctor's so I don't know for sure. My last pregnancy was just over four years ago. It resulted in a miscarriage at twelve weeks. It was devestating to me! Three days after that, I was rushed to the emergency room with MAJOR blood clots in the arter and veins of my leg and in my lungs. Pretty scary. As a result, I lost a leg due to no bloodflow to my foot. I am now on life-long blood thinners.       My question is this:  Has anyone been pregnant and had to take the Lovenox shots since BEFORE getting pregnant? What are the chances of miscarrying? If anyone can help, I'd greatly appreciate it! :)

I have no idea to go about this, but all I know is that I'm the money maker, so there's no way I can stay at home for more than the first couple of weeks after my childbirth. Is there any way that I could milk my boobs so he can feed the baby while I'm at work? I know nothing about this, I'm not the maternal type and no one I know really has kids, so I'm asking out. And that premilk I saved in the freezer, is it any good now that I froze it? Real answers please, I don't like jokes when it comes to important matters like this.

I used First Response Early Result. 2 or 3 days ago I had some very light brown spotting for about a day when I'd wipe. Could that have been my period? I thought it might have been implantation bleeding but I thought that only happened before your missed period. I also had pretty bad cramps during the spotting and since it's stopped I've had no cramps. I also have sore breasts, slight nausea after I eat, headaches and a few other pregnancy signs. I don't feel like I'm going to get my period at all. My doctor said to wait a week then if my period still hasn't come to call her but not knowing what is going on is driving me nuts! Have any of you been 5 or so days late and got negative tests and it turned out to be that you were pregnant? If so, when did you get your BFP? Could I still be testing too early? Your advice would be so helpful! Thanks in advance.
