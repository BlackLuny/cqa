While around it have you made any comments about how a Playstation 3 is superior, or that you want to get one, etc.  Maybe it just cracked under the pressure...in other words, committed suicide.  It's not pretty, but it does happen...      Ok, in all seriousness, why do you need to fix it now anyway?  I mean, now that you have the good laser in your new PS2, you won't be able to get your old one working with the damaged laser anyway.  My guess would be a lose connection somewhere, so just look for that kind of thing.  But, I still don't see how you can fix up your old one and sell it seeing as you put the broken laser in it.  I mean, used PS2's that are in good condition sell for like $50 with no controllers or games included, so you'd be lucky to get $25 to be honest.
CKRfaRYvaa	I can only speak for Verizon Wireless, but it is unlimited for all practical intents and purposes. The actual amount of minutes per line is something like 99,999 per month, which is more minutes than there are in the month; therefore it is impossible to go over on nights and weekends.     The only exception to this is if you have one of the old plans from several years ago. Some of these plans did have limited features such as 1000 or 3500 night/weekend minutes. Just check your bill and it will say if you have one of these plans, or call customer service and ask. Generally, if your bill says you are on America's Choice or Nationwide, then you're on a newer plan and have unlimited night/weekend minutes.|`|CD0JesQeaa	well i know for unlimited texting the actual limit is 999,999     it will be impossible to go over the limit so don't worry about getting any overages!

If you use a site like Amazon or iTunes Store, it is legal. However using free music download sites or torrents is illegal because you are not paying the producers for it, and are effectively stealing the music from them|`|81xlGgHuaa	Downloading music from the internet can be okay. Like from Amazon or iTunes. (They pay the artist just as you would if you bought a regular CD.) Where as other sites just have the MP3 there ready to download without paying the artist.

EJIsHdZhaa	Shutter speed is one of the exposure controls (faster shutter less light, slower shutter more light) but also has a bearing on motion rendering.  If you are shooting sports and want to freeze the action then you need a fast shutter, if you want creative blur, say as on moving water, then a slow shutter is used.    Focal length can dictate perspective and alter how a subject appears in the frame.  Wide lenses can distort where are as tele lenses can overly flatten.   If you tell us about your intended subject we can recommend suitable settings.    There is a rule of thumb to avoid camera shake when hand holding, which links focal length & shutter.    Generally your shutter number should be the same or higher than your focal length to avoid camera shake blur:    So if you have an equivalent to 50mm lens you should be using 1/60th of a second or faster to avoid camera shake.    If you have a wide lens such as an equivalent 28mm then you should use 1/30th.  If you have a 200mm equivalent lens then you need to use 1/250th or faster.    In practice if you brace your body against a car or tree etc and use a smooth shutter release you can sometimes get away with a slower shutter.  If your lens has IS or VR then you can usually use a slower shutter.  Although at big zooms motion blur from the subject can become the problem.    I say equivalent mm because many DSLRs have cropped sensors, which effectivley increase the focal length, so that an 18-55mm lens behaves more like a 28-90 lens would on a traditional camera.|`|Lyl3mHIKaa	the answer given by Paul R is very good and I concur with his statements.  Shutter speed must be faster for the longer focal lengths because of the bad effects of camera shake have to be controlled.  The longer the focal length the faster the shutter has to be to give you an acceptable picture.   Of course, using a tripod will help control camera shake, and absolutely has to be used when doing very long exposures anyway.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	The Exposure Triangle is made up of ISO, shutter speed and f-stop.     If you set the ISO, say to 100, and don't change it then you have two variables: shutter speed and f-stop. If you change one then the other has to change.    ISO is a measurement of the sensitivity to light of a light sensitive surface, either film or digital sensor. A low ISO (50, 64, 100) is very insensitive and requires more light. We use a low ISO when we want the best possible images. A high ISO (400, 800, etc.) is very sensitive and requires less light. We use a high ISO for sports/action or in low-light situations where we can't use a flash. The ISO also has a part in determining our shutter speed.    The f-stop or aperture (they're the same thing) is formed by the diaphragm inside the lens. The diaphragm is made up movable, of thin metal metal blades and is represented by numbers such as 1.4, 2,  2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16. The smaller the number the larger the opening in the diaphragm. A large opening such as f1.4 will admit all the available light. A small opening like f16 will admit very little light. The f-stop also has a part in determining shutter speed.    Our shutter speed determines how long the light admitted by the lens is allowed to expose our light sensitive surface. If we are using ISO 100 and an f-stop of f16 our shutter speed will be slow. If we "open up' to f4 our shutter speed will be much faster.    The best way to show this is by using the old "Sunny 16 Rule" which states: "On a sunny day, set your aperture to f16 and your shutter speed to 1/ISO."     ISO 100  f16 @ 1/100 sec.   f11 @ 1/200 sec.  f8 @ 1/400 sec.  f5.6 @ 1/800 sec.  f4 @ 1/1600 sec.  f2.8 @ 1/3200 sec.  f2 @ 1/6400 sec.  f1.4 @ 1/12800 sec.    By f4 we are likely close to the minimum shutter speed on most cameras. If your camera has a 1/4000 sec. shutter speed then you could go to f2.8. (NOTE: If it were possible to achieve all 8 shutter speeds shown in our example all 8 exposures would be identical).    As we "open up" from f16 to f11 our lens is admitting twice as much light and our shutter speed gets faster. More light = a shorter required exposure.    When we're out shooting we have to pay attention to our shutter speed to avoid ruining our picture due to camera shake or subject movement. This is especially true if you shoot in "Aperture Priority" like I do. I prefer to set the f-stop and let the camera set the shutter speed. I watch (in the viewfinder) what shutter speed the camera sets and adjust my f-stop if needed if the shutter speed is too slow.    The focal length we choose has more to do with composition than anything else. For a sweeping landscape we might use a 12mm lens. To isolate a section of the subject we might use a 200mm lens.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	they're not the only functions you need to consider. shutter speed when you want to stop motion, or, blur motion. focal length for field of view, perspective and composition. aperture for depth of field and light control, and bokeh. iso for sensor sensitivity to gather enough light. composition...do i want to shoot from above or below?.

Cl8FwsI2aa	You can't do much without jailbreaking an iPhone 3G. You can access the AppStore and buy applications but that's it.    I suppose phone stores would jailbreak your iPhone 3G but what's the point. Research and do it yourself.    Jailbreaking is totally worth it. I, myself,  jailbroke my iPhone 3G the third day after I bought it because I was getting bored.    If you want to unlock your iPhone 3G, you can only do it by jailbreaking it first. The result of unlocking is allowing your iPhone to operate on a carrier other than the one it is locked to.    The most common reasons to jailbreak an iPhone 3G are to gain access to third party apps for free without using the iTunes App Store, video camera features, extensive personal customization and using the iPhone as a modem for laptops, but there are other features available that make it worth performing a jailbreak on an iPhone.    The biggest advantage of jailbreaking an Apple iPhone is gaining access to the following features:-    1) Open SSH is a handy tool for copying files to and from your iPhone. Open SSH gives iPhone user root access to the phone to enable the transferring of NES roms, voicemail, text files and more.  2) VNSea is an amazing app that allows you to remotely control a home computer from your iPhone.  3) Better Gaming options are available on the Apple iPhone but only if you are willing to shell out the bucks to download the apps from the iTunes App Store. Jailbreaking your iPhone gives you better gaming options like the NES Emulator for free.  4) Categories is an app that's available through Cydia on an Apple iPhone that's been jailbroken. It works like a filing cabinet that allows you to organize the icons on your iPhone springboard.  5) Backgrounder is one of the most useable tools for the iPhone since an iPhone that has not been jailbroken can only run one app at a time. What the backgrounder app does is allow iPhone users to run more than one app at the same time.  6) 'Cycorder' allows you to record video.  7) 'WinterBoard' allows you to change the themes for the Keyboard, SpringBoard, Lockscreen etc by downloading them from Cydia.    With Cydia you can install apps that allow you to customize your springboard, change your sounds, alter icons, install themes and more for free without ever accessing iTunes.    Performing a jailbreak on an iPhone 3G will void your warranty, however if you restore the iPhone back to the original factory settings before you ship it back to Apple you will still have an intact warranty.    Good luck.|`|PwjxhDAXaa	never jailbrak it automatically takes off the warranty and it makes it much slower and worse. besides their is really no reason to jailbreak it

As the video has to be compressed to get large amounts of data/video onto a small card (10-20GB)    HDD As above but also they don't like to be bumped or jolted.     Mini DVD Have lots of problems with jumping, write fails also when you want to finish the disk (finalise) Read link need lots of spare disks    Mini DV still is the best format. High quality video, no compression problems. No problems with any video editing software. Fill a tape up and change it they are cheap.  one hour of high quality video.    I use Mini Dv and have done for a long time now.       the make well thats up to you because its down to what you like and what features you want.

If it can, and the cable fits, then it'll work - USB is a standard interface.

If your phone is under warrantee & has been in for repair more than 3 times ithen should be entitled to a new handset ! also if your having the same problems each time then obviously the phone is not being sorted properly when it goes in for repair 2 things you could do either go direct to sony ericsson & complain or go to o2 & complain to there complaints department ! also as for your friends phones freezing it depends on the phone as the newer sony's seem to suffer with software issues but normally after having the software upgrades it seems to cure them ... hope this helps|`|7LcOePwuaa	yes it is a common problem with sony ericsson phones.i have the k800i not too different from yours perhaps and it happens to mine too.but very rarely and only when i keep pressing and then press something else like mad when i get angry at it for some varied reason.you can try to fix it.i don't care to fix it because i know what's causing it and i can stop it by not letting out my frustration on the phone.try it out.maybe it'll work.

e4hMIUGCaa	To make your phone enable accessing the internet and emailing you need to set your phone with gprs setting parameters provided by your cellprovider.As it is differ from one to another,you have to contact your CS cellprovider for this purpose,or visit its website.Most provider provide its subscribers with an automatic gprs setting parameter sent via sms,upon receiving this sms subscriber have to save and make it as default gprs configuration.Just press Yes,when the phone prompt to do so.To request this setting subscriber have to send  sms : GPRSMobile brandmobile model,e.g: GPRS Sonyericsson w990i  and send it to a number provided by the provider for this purpose.So,as you didnt mention your provider,you have to contact your cellprovider to ask if they provide an automatic setting or you have to instal it manually or you have to go to their office.  . POP3 and SMTP setting is need to as if you want to do emailing (send receive email, with built in email client.To use this feature,you need to have an email account that support POP3 or IMAP4.Gmail has this feature for free,im not sure yahoo has it.   ..

502de2cc3792d16d3d9fb9314dac8743aa	I just recently got a blackberry (Curve) and i like it.  Like you, i had an LG (not the shine, though) and i'm able to figure it out pretty well.  All i did was pop my sim card out from the old phone and put it in the new one and voila! It only transfered one number per contact but otherwise, everyone's there-- no ringtones or pictures, though.  You'll have to keep your sim in the LG, bluetooth them to your computer, put the sim in the blackberry and then transfer them from the comp back to the bb.    I have AT&T and they're okay i guess... i've never had another provider.  And i don't think they have a 'pay as you go' plan for Smartphones (like Blackberries) but you can see    Good luck

But you should know that Bush is not a good brand.   Your mum may remember famous Bush radios from the 1960s but these days it's just a name given to low quality cheap products.    Sorry, but the sound will be less than hi-fi, the picture will have a low  contrast ratio and a very poor viewing angle; more importantly, it will be unreliable. It's a sad fact that cheapo televisions fail about 10X more often than mainstream brands like Sony, Panasonic, LG or Philips. Normally just after the guarantee expires. They are not normally economically repairable.    Spend an extra 50 and get a Sony. You'll have an excellent set that will last for years and years.

AA12116276	Um, restoring your iPod is not the answer. This is just an iPod issue, and restoring won't help it.     I don't know what kind of iPod you have, but I have a Touch and when I have this issue usually just deleting the artwork from iTunes and then adding it again helps. Delete the song from your iPod first. Then right-click the file in iTunes, click "get info," go to the artwork tab and then delete the art. Either try to let iTunes find it again, or--I'd recommend--go somewhere like amazon.com and paste the artwork into iTunes from there by copying the art first from amazon. Then sync the song again.|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	same happened to me,... leave it like that, dont try to fix anything, it may ruin ur ipod,...

qaPyaFUcaa	There are 2 differences that I know of.    1:  the wire (obvious)  2:  the wireless one is just a small device that clips on your ear while the wired one is a full headset that goes over your head and a microphone in front of your mouth    That's it, as far as sound quality and microphone pickup they are both basically the same.    What I actually use is a cell phone headset.  The 360's input is just a 2.5mm jack with mono sound.  Any cell phone earpiece/mic that is only for one ear should work fine.  I picked one up for $10 and found it much more comfortable than the big, bulky xbox 360 headset.    However, I do HATE the wire for any headset when playing Rock Band.  It doesn't bother me when playing a game using a regular controller though.|`|xpu4XgPXaa	The wireless one is really good and worth the value i would go for that one|`|mavWffD5aa	The wireless one does not have the mute feature while the wired one does.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	I disagree with the delay as well.  In my city, the TV stations are going to shut off their analog stations anyway.  The electric bill for a TV transmitter is very high.  Most stations simply didn't budget the added electric cost and don't want to continue paying it.  There may also be expensive space rent, both for the transmitting equipment and the antenna on the tower.      Apparently the new bill doesn't require a TV station to continue broadcasting in analog.  A short quote from the article below:   "276 stations have told the commission that they plan to shut off their analog signals on the current transition date of Feb. 17".    The switchover in the US was indeed a deadline.  The analog transmitters were to be shut off on Feb. 17 by FCC order.  That order has now been delayed until June 12 by Congress.|`|7HEZhx46aa	I agree, some people just refuse to grow with the times. I call those people "technologically retarded".

You watch -- in June, it'll be the same sob stories.|`|q5m9g1yWaa	I think they voted against it anyway.

The digital "changeover" is not a deadline, since there two aspects to this.    The first is obviously the installation and operation of a digital transmitter. When this has taken place, you will be able to buy and install a digital decoder to receive the signals. There is NO deadline. When the transmitter is sending digital signals, you can choose when you buy the decoder and receive the signals.    Has a date been set for this transmitter coming on line? It can be that such a date is not achieved, for technical or practical reasons, and in that case, you will have to wait before you need to buy the decoder.    The next stage will not occur until after the digital transmitter has been in operation for a period, and that stage DOES NOT offer you any advantage. It is, quite simply, the closing down of the analogue transmitter, and when that happens, ONLY digital pictures will be available in the area. I don't see how this "deadline?" is of any advantage to any viewer, as it means that anyone who does not have a digital decoder will lose their terrestrial TV. Surely, that cannot cause you any concern?    Passed the deadline? This sounds like a story written by a journalist trying to sell newspapers. Each area of the country has a different date for the installation of digital TV, and consequently, the closing of the analogue transmitters.|`|9mTctb7jaa	The "delay" is just hyperbole. The fact is all analog television broadcast licenses have already expired, and no television broadcaster is currently legally required to operate in the analog mode.  Several hundred have already shut down analog rather than make expesive repairs that would be of benefit for only a couple of weeks. Many hundred more have made firm commitments to shut off analog on Februrary 17, and will do so despite the "delay" legislation.  Considering that most people get television via cable or satellite, the deadline is mostly a non event. The reason for the "delay" is the government rebate program for converter boxes ran out of money and congress is trying to cover their *** with angry constituents who missed out.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?    It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential output size, not image quality.     In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera.

You can't assess a camera's quality on number of pixels it used or the size of its onboard memory though!  At 32MB though you WILL need to invest in a card to save pictures to - 32MB will only save about 10 pictures taken using all the pixels.|`|38c6373fd3b19e3800899c623919c0e0aa	Canon's always use decent quality sensors and their color-capture is pretty accurate. The Megapixel issue is only about how big you think you might want to make a print at some point. With 7 MP, you should get a photo, up to an 11" x 14" at a decent quality.    You will need MUCH more memory though, and as cheap as memory cards are now, I'd get at least a 1 to 2 GB memory card. That would hold at least 100 photos for the 1 GB.
HekFanRvaa	the package says it includes 3.5mm stereo cable to connect with MP3 players. The simplest way to connect it, is to directly hook up the 3.5 stereo plugs of this speaker to your TV (if you have HDTV you must hve this jack for headphones) so that you can also use these speakers even when your are only watching TV programs. This way you can leave the HDMI setup of your TV and PS3.|`|cdf3e1235bb8fdfcc5571d382014cebfaa	check their website they have an info sheet.|`|IZIi27HYaa	not sure i'm using a digital audio lead to conect ps3 to surround sound as well as the hdmi so this might be what you need

You can't attach them to the PS3.  You could attach the PS3 and speakers to a receiver, but a decent 5.1 surround sound system is going to cost you more than what you're willing to spend.  I don't know about prices in the UK, but in the US you can't get even a low-end surround system worth a squirt for less than $300.|`|AA11593071	Anything but bose.|`|3u2QqrNfaa	Bose are the best
lebKMTaQaa	Well, I will be perfectly honest in that I am not familiar with that particular sound system, however I used to have my PS3 hooked up to a computer monitor and running sound through a tiny surround sound set up. You can go in the menu on the PS3 and have the audio and video delivered by different cables. In this case you want HDMI video and the A/V (you know, the red and white cables the system comes with, it may be referred to as SCART in the menu) cables should also be hooked up to deliver audio to your speakers.    Now, this was a while ago that I did this so I am not completely sure how I went about it. You may be able to just go in and change the sound setting to A/V or you may have to go to the display settings to hook up the HDMI video. PS3 will ask if you want both audio and video through the HDMI, at which point you would say no and choose a separate audio.    Now, there may be a more optimal way of setting this up with that particular sound system, like an optical output cable, but I don't know too much about that sort of thing!    Hope I helped! My knowledge on these set ups is pretty limited, but I saw no one answering you and thought I would tell you what I could!

Anything beyond that an then get a plasma or a projection system.    Both LCD's and Plasmas will suffer from screen retention when left on a still image for a certain period of time.

If thats YOU, click the I Did This button. Rate:  (0 Ratings)   Televisions have come a long way from their black and white days. Now the act of buying a television takes learning a whole lexicon of foreign verbiage. Phrases such as refresh rate, stuck pixels and viewing angles are an integral part of the television purchase. When purchasing a new television technology it is imperative to know the parameters of comparison to know the right television to buy.    Email Send to Phone Print ArticleAdd to Favorites Flag Article    InstructionsDifficulty: Moderate   Step1Determine the relative screen size and the different size ranges available. In other words, which television technologies not only offer the largest screens but which one offers the most amount of variety of sizes to choose from.   Step2Ascertain the screen refresh rate of the Plasma and LCD video displays. The screen refresh rate is the ability of the image display to handle fast and sudden movements on the screen without any noticeable flickering.   Step3Make sure to ask about burn-in or stuck pixels. Though this is not the problem it once was, sometimes these television technologies can suffer from pixels that are stuck or burned permanently into television after prolonged use. So be sure to research any brand of flat television for a history of this problem.   Step4Check the viewing angle of the Plasma and LCD video displays. The viewing angle is the greatest angle at which a person can view a display without noticeable depreciation in the definition of the display. So be sure to view each technology from different angles to compare them properly.   Step5Contrast the product life span of plasma and LCD video displays. In other words, how long will it be before a person has to replace the product?      Plasma TVs operate in a manner similar to a fluorescent light tube: both contain inert gases, and both "glow" because of electric charges passing through the gas. A plasma display is made up of many thousands of tiny cells that are filled with neon and xenon gas in a plasma state. When the plasma TV is on, electricity passes from electrodes into the gases, causing the gases to become charged and bounce off of phosphors, creating red, green or blue colors. (The pixels, or tiny squares of light on the screen, are simply groups of red, green and blue phosphors.)   LCD TVs Use an Older Technology  LCD TVs use the same technology used in many hand-held calculators--they use the liquid crystal displays (LCD). A flat-screen display consists of two, polarized layers of transparent material, one of which has a coating of liquid crystals on it. When electricity passes through the liquid crystals, they bend in such a manner as to filter white light which comes from a light behind the screen. (Liquid crystals do not generate their own light, so we need a light source to see the image the crystals create.)   Pros and Cons of a Plasma TV  Plasma TVs offer 160-degree viewing angles, which allow the picture to be viewed clearly from the side. They offer richer colors and are more suitable for darker rooms and for watching fast-moving pictures, such as sports. Very large screen sizes are available; however, plasma TVs are usually heavier than LCD TVs, which makes them more difficult to hang on a wall. Plasma TVs are susceptible to "burn-in"--the permanent etching of an image into the pixels when an image is left on the screen for a long period of time. Plasma TVs generate a lot of heat and draw more power than LCD TVs because they must light each pixel on the screen. This type of TV does not do well at high altitudes because gases are sealed between glass, and at altitudes above 6,500 feet, these TVs can buzz like an old neon sign.   Pros and Cons of an LCD TV  LCD TVs use a third less power than plasma TVs and do not generate as much heat. These TVs are best for bright rooms and for using as display devices for video games and computers. There is no fear of "burn-in" with LCDs, but viewing the|`|pk4dteZnaa	You should check out the HDTV guide at:    elmlife.com/guide/HDTVBuyingGuide?595    It features interactive advice from a real home theater expert...you can even click on the questions for more information on a specific topic.

They consume too much electricity. At least one manufacturer has already dropped them.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	In your specific case, since your primary use will be gaming, I'd recommend LCD.    Plasmas have historically suffered from burn-in when displaying static images for long periods of time.  They've improved, but there is still some vulnerability.    Games often have static areas of the screen that never change.  If played for hours and hours, they could results in some burn in.

pZGLhV2Waa	I would say the Canon G10. The reasons are that it can be fully manual, the ability to shoot RAW, build quality, and it has a viewfinder.|`|EJIsHdZhaa	For feature set & quality of build I would agree with the G10.    However as i already have an DSLR I would probably want to go the opposite way with a compact camera, rather than all out range I think I would choose something for compact size rather than extensive feature set, as such, and as a former afficianado of their GR-1s compact, I would probably opt for a ricoh GRD mk2 or GX200.    Thats just me though.  When all out user control and image quality were my objectives I would be using my DSLR or 35mm SLR, for just having a camera in my pocket giving acceptable results, then it'd be a ricoh.    I haven't bought one yet because my ancient 4MP canon powershot s40 refuses to die!  Its a good solid camera with good images shot in raw up to 12x8.

Connect the player to the television set through an HDMI cable. Only when you do this will you get the full High Definition delivery.    An ordinary DVD will not give an HD picture because it does not have HD content recorded on it. No playing machine can add high definition detail where it wasn't there on the disc in the first place.   An upscaling DVD player (or computer) that outputs through an HDMI link (not an ordinary DVI link) will provide a better picture than an ordinary one but it still won't be HD.    Laptops are not HD players so you will not be able to play a Blu-ray disc through one. It may have installed video software that claims to be capable of handling HD recordings but the built in disc drive won't play or record it.     I don't know of any mainstream computer (laptop or desktop) that has a built in HD compatible (Blu-ray) disc drive. These drives alone would cost nearly half the price of most PCs.

AA12116276	Can't tell if you mean in a sitting or over a lifetime.     In a sitting: The highest I've seen advertised is about 36 hours on music. But it really depends on how you use your Touch. In general, it will last over a day long. But you need to have wifi off and have the screen auto-lock on the lowest setting (i.e. one min or whichever makes the screen go black quickest). You can also press the sleep button to preserve battery. Video time differs from audio, but I can't remember specifics on that since I don't use my Touch for video.    If you use applications, in general your battery will go down quicker. This seems to be application-specific, i.e. dependent on which application you're using. Your Touch probably will not last a whole day using applications, though.     You can do an internet search on this info and easily find the info. I have seen several articles and online forums with users citing specifics for audio and video.

tHjBr4L4aa	Every lens for your D40 will work with the D90.  Likewise, any lens for your N6006 will function perfectly. The only Nikon mount lenses that won't work on your D90 would be an evasive fisheye and Pre-AI models.  AI, AI-S, and AI-converted lenses will mount, but must be metered manually.    Here's a chart to help  http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/compati...|`|HBNx77BBaa	Yes your old lenses from the N6006 will be fine. The D90 has a focus motor built in so it can work both with lenses that have their own motor and lenses that require the focus motor to be in the camera.    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond90...|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Yes, Virtually every lens made from 1959 on will work on either camera to some degree. The D40 does not have a focus motor in the body so the only lenses that will auto focus on it are either AFi or AFs models. You can manually focus them though. As for the D90 any auto focus lens will work as it has a focus motor.|`|3TqPF1zMaa	It would be more helpful to know the specific lens models you're curious about, rather than the camera they are currently connected to. However, generally, a Nikon F mount lens will work with any Nikon F mount camera. Every Nikon SLR camera made since 1959 uses the Nikon F mount.    The details come down to the specifics of the lenses as to whether they will autofocus or work with automatic exposure modes.    Your D40 will likely work with your older lenses using manual focus but the exposure meter won't work correctly. Go ahead and try it. The only caution about connecting old lenses to a newer camera is to not force anything that doesn't feel like it wants to connect and avoid older fisheye lenses with strange designs until you double-check the compatibility with that particular model.    To get working automatic exposure with your older lenses, you will likely want to consider a Nikon D200, D300 or D700 camera. The D90, although very advanced, does not have to ability to meter with older lenses. The D90, D200, D300 and D700 also all have an autofocus motor & screw to operate older AF autofocus lenses.

All so called Voice over IP (VoIP) carriers who use the Internet for transport cannot assure voice quality.  It makes no difference who the carrier is.  It cannot be rectified by a faster broadband internet connection.  The problem is that VoIP packets are time and sequence sensitive (packets must arive in order and on time).  If there is any delay due to any congestion, packets arrive out of order or not on time and this degrades quality markedly.  Congestion delays are common on all routers, even those on the Internet.    On private networks, VoIP packets are marked for and receive priority whenever congestion occurs. This provides voice quality.      However, the Internet routers do not respect or pay any heed to packets marked for priority.  Therefore any VoIP carrier that uses the Internet for transport just cannot assure quality regardless of what they claim.  They are cheap - but they do not work.|`|vLvfjCNLaa	Phone quality depends a lot on your internet connection and also your computer. First of all, make sure you're using a high speed internet connection. Magic Jack will not work well if your internet connection is slow or spotty. Also, I found that if you don't have enough RAM and you're running too many other things at the same time when you're trying to use the phone the quality gets bad. Make sure you have at least 512 MB of RAM if you're using Windows XP. 1 or 2 GB would be better. If you're using Vista you will definitely need 1-3 GB of RAM, the more the better. So, close everything you're running, reboot and try using the phone by itself and see how the quality is. This may solve your problem. If it doesn't, make sure you have enough RAM. If all this fails, Magic Jack's online chat is normally pretty helpful. Hope this helps.

qaPyaFUcaa	OK, here's what I've found about the issue.  It doesn't matter, but when you choose one, keep it that way.    It seems to me that people usually have the scratch problem when they move the xbox, and that you have a really good chance of it happening when you switch the xbox from horizontal to vertical, or from vertical back to horizontal.    That's why you hear people say it needs to be one way or the other, when they try it the other way, they suddenly get scratches.    However, since you said you were purchasing a new xbox 360, you wouldn't have to worry about that problem.  The new systems come with stabilizers in the dvd rom drive so that the discs won't scratch anymore so that MS can avoid anymore lawsuits.|`|ae528b98e69adf3dc67010ecc9bc16fcaa	okay, here's my input i'll say it doesn't matter.    some say it's better flat because the disc is spinning horizontally and there's a less chance of it cracking or scratching games because there're less opposing forces    while others say if better standing up for almost the same reason.    the console spins the games at very high speeds if the disc is unbalanced, (a sticker on the cd could be enough), the normal vibration that occurs could scratch the cd or crack it.    so i've had problems both ways, i've had 2 xbox360s (first one was replaced) in 3 years and both of the cracked 1 game. The first one used to be flat and the newer one stands.    if you use it flat make sure it's not on carpet, so it has better ventilation.|`|QzVIrrgFaa	laying down because standing scratches  your disc|`|xS1EiyDEaa	yeah, laying down is better. first, if it is standing up, it will easily fall, and i have had mine standing up for about a month and it already scratches my discs a little bit. and it seems like it is a little bit louder.|`|Rgqhr3zRaa	NO laying down is the best cuz standing scratches your disk|`|9wblT5sYaa	go with lying down.

But, just keep it on it's side, it hasn't tore up, or scratched the discs or anything.    Hope i helped ya out.|`|rLuKkSpeaa	well my brother had a xbox he lied down and it broke he got the 3 red rings. my xobx has lasted me years and not a single problem so ill have to say standing is better.|`|Ps3kMSFyaa	You should definitely keep it laying down. The main reason Xbox'x mess up is because of a little metal piece inside the disk drive. when you have the system up right, overtime the metal piece bends from the heat and eventually ends up touching the disk. that usually cause the Xbox to freeze, scratch the disk, or just shatter the disk causing the fragments to destroy the inside of the system. so just make sure it is laying down.
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?    It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential output size, not image quality.     In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

The number of pictures you can store in any memory chip depends on two main factors:  1)The size of the picture the camera takes (the size selected from a list in the camera) and   2)The definition, or quality, which is chosen also in the camera; you can many times select basic, normal, fine and high.  This selects the amount of compression the chosen picture size goes through before it gets stored on the memory chip.  Normally, the camera will tell you how many pictures you have left when you put the chip in the camera, and turn it on in shooting mode.

KtBfxkNAaa	If you have downloaded the game correctly, you should have an mulitplayer option on your desktop next to your single player. I am on CoD4 and this is how I get online.     Once it loads and you are at the main screen. You'll have to choose your profile. Then you need to choose "join server"     On the server screen you can pick different types of games to play such as; free-for-all, teamdeathmatch, sabotage etc, I personally like free-for-all.     Hit the refresh button, and all available servers will be shown as a list, choose one. It will load and you will choose your class(which type of primary weapon, side arm etc.)     Once you choose, you should start playing. But be careful, there are alot of gamers with cheats that make it no fun. join a "mod" that doesn't allow. I play at "totalrealismnobullmod" They have better and bigger maps compared to just the standard CoD4 maps.

LIVE is better.|`|pTSk4O8Aaa	PSN is much better. i have both.

UAYzLyN4aa	Briefly, you are correct.     The notion that you should run the battery down is based on gross misunderstanding and rumor, and the misunderstanding did not even come from lithium-ion (LiIon) batteries (the type used in the iPhone). It came from nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries, which were the first type of small rechargeable battery in common consumer use (in flashlights, radios, etc.).     People thought you always had to fully discharge a NiCd to avoid "memory." The notion was that if you didn't fully discharge it, the NiCd battery would "remember" how much charge you'd used and would only provide that much charge in the future.     Fact is, consumer NiCds never showed "memory effect". EVER.     "Memory effect" was first seen in very large NiCd cells used in aerospace (specifically aboard satellites), and to get it you had to repeatedly - hundreds of times - discharge the cell to exactly the same point (within a percent or two).     The problem consumer NiCds did have is called "voltage depression". It's caused by long-term trickle charging with a "dumb charger" that doesn't know when to shut off. A lot of people called it "memory effect" because it had the same net effect: The cell wouldn't run the gadget for as long as it used to. But it wasn't because of failure to completely discharge, it was because of failure to stop charging the poor thing.     "Voltage depression" can be avoided in NiCds by using a smart charger.     ( Note that overcharging a li-ion battery is bad too - very bad, in fact - but all devices that use li-ion batteries use smart chargers; they stop charging when the battery is full. )     Now, both problems could be cured by a deep discharge/recharge cycle or two. But that doesn't mean that *routine* deep discharge/recharge cycles are good for a NiCd. They're not.     So... we have a myth that was not true in the first place; the myth didn't even apply to the type of battery that's in the iPhone; and what flimsy basis in fact the myth did have would have been avoided by using smart chargers, which all li-ion devices have.     I think that can be summed up as "three strikes, you're out."     In fact, deep discharge is bad for ANY rechargeable battery type.     Ever leave your car lights on and run the battery down to dead? Sure, you can get a jump charge and keep going. But you'll find that battery won't hold a charge well any more. You'll be replacing it soon.     The "discharge fully once a month" thing isn't really great for the battery either. However the charge monitor circuits in some devices *may* need this in order to stay calibrated correctly - to show the correct amount of charge remaining.     One other thing to be aware of: Li-ion batteries just die over time, no matter how you treat them. THis is calendar time, not charge cycles or run time or anything else. This is a chemical decay process that begins the moment the cells are assembled. Useful lifetime is generally two to three years. A few will fail sooner than that; a few are still going strong after five years,but two to three is what you should expect.     So when your iphone needs a new battery after two years, please don't think it's because you didn't discharge it fully every time. Li-ions just do that. When yours does, either get a new iPhone (you'll probably want the new model by then anyway!) or have Apple replace the battery. I treat my laptop batteries the same way: Periodic battery replacement is part of the expected maintenance cost, just like it is for a car.     Also, despite the warning that deep discharge is bad, don't let this stop you from enjoying your iPhone. i.e. don't worry about an occasional deep discharge. Just don't do it routinely.
vkzkXWfzaa	A true macro lens will do a ratio of 1:1.  The sensor crop just alters the focal length of the lens it does not alter the magnification of the lens (how close it will focus). What it does alter is the distance from the subject to your camera, which will be greater with a smaller sensor, but the frame will be exactly the same and will still have a magnification of 1:1.    Chris|`|Lyl3mHIKaa	Macro has lost a lot of its precise definition these days.  Almost any camera that can be set into a 'close-up' focussing setting is called Macro. This mode is generally denoted by a flower symbol.  Many manufacturers have only very limited "35-mm equivalent" numbers and they are largely giving that up now since it is not really a help.|`|rnzFaYM3aa	"Macro" with compact cameras is simply a term used to describe the fact that it can get "close" to a subject - just a relative close. I have seen very few compact cameras which indeed do achieve the 1:1 ratio. Macro when referring to a dSLR does indeed still mean the 1:1 ratio. Because the formulations of the lenses are identical for dSLR's as they are for film SLR's, they must reproduce at an equal size, meaning 1:1. A full frame dSLR will fit just as much of the object being reproduced onto its chip, yielding a "less" magnified look, while a condensed sensor dSLR will fit less, therefor giving a "more" magnified view.
O8qdCBzLaa	For every company that has been hurt by the computer age, there's one that's been helped by it. If companies can't change with the times, they go under and some on-line company takes its place.     As far as the post office is concerned, they may be losing money on regular mail delivery. But, they make a lot of money on shipping of parcels that people buy on line. And, while many stores are going bankrupt lately, sites like amazon.com had their best holiday season ever in 2008.

Xxviy63Paa	without a doubt, the Commodore 64 has given the most bang for the buck. What did it cost, $150, I can't remember... what I do remember is almost nobody paid for a game, every game was pirated and widely distributed, and the industry was powerless to make effective copy protection. The C64 saw the birth of video game piracy.     Good or bad, right or wrong, back in those days, everybody played copied games. Practically everybody. And you didn't need the internet to do it, either. You just got the game from your friends, or on a private BBS.     It also was better at playing games than the consoles of its time, the ataris and colecovisions etc.    I know the C64 was a computer, but its use was 95 percent for games. And that's the same for the ps3. PS3 is for games, but it can be a computer too. If ps3 is a console, Commodore 64 should count as one also.    But if you refuse to accept Commodore 64 as a game console, the next most worth-the-price has been the playstation 2. It's an easy question to answer if you look at buying a console as an investment. Playstation 2 is almost 10 years old now, and still more used than any other game platform, more than twice as much. This was in an AP news article recently. To still be on top after 10 years is an incredible achievement. More games have been made for ps2 than any console in history. And nowadays you can buy them all for $1 to $5 in a second-hand cd store. They still sell ps2 games new, too. They still sell new ps2's! 10 years old and still king.|`|5d3857ef7e838b0d10440e9b9f7eb802aa	I would have to say SNES for me.  Got it for Christmas as a kid, now its worth like 1000, cuz its perfect.

AA11417192	A couple things to address.  A FTA box is designed to get unencrypted signals from a variety of satellites, true the free programming that is offered is probably not the best.  Your "friend" has uploaded a modded bin to his fta receiver which allows them to view Dish channels as if they were subscribed and then some.  This is basically theft of service, I don't know how the laws would apply to someone outside of the US but if you live in the US then it would be illegal to steal dish service. The chances of getting caught are slim as someone would have to physically enter your house and catch you in the act.  Dish network is constantly battling FTA boxes to shut them down so it is work to keep up, the coming year should introduce Nagra3 which should stop FTA either supposedly and perhaps but not maybe for good.|`|fxXJZZRKaa	It's 100% legal. Why do you think they're making the switch  To digital from analog broadcast? This is made specificaly for people with an over-the-air antenna. It's true it's free but you don't get ALL the channels other paid subscribers offer and the quality of the channels is not as good.|`|4xyMw64Iaa	The amount of channels you get has to do with your antenna's strength.  With the digital transition, you get crystal clear channels.  They look exactly like they would with cable or satellite (paid).  I have two antennas facing opposite directions and I get 20-30 channels. They're the channels you would get on basic cable.    The nice thing about free to air is:  you spend about $150 and some installation time and never have to pay anything again.    All we needed to purchase was a DTV converter box for every TV, cables to connect, antenna(s) and hardware to mount the antennas.    We get NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, PBS, and other channels that are specific to our area.    The sources below will assist you with antenna selection and aiming.    Good luck!

Would choose 3) Medium2 - 1600*1200 as this is equal to a 3 MP setting unless you plan to print a photo larger than 8 x 10 inches.  You actually lose picture quality when you crop a higher MP photo down to an 8 x 10 print.  It also takes more money, memory space, processing, and transmission time with a higher setting.  Megapixel resolution is about potential output size, not image quality.     Most companies are touting high mega pixel to sell cameras, but high mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for large pictures or enlarging parts of pictures. Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.   http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...   http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...     The memory card I like, bought, and have tested is the Kodak 1GB for $10.88 at Walmart. Had liked SanDisk, but had trouble with two and these were a little more expensive so took them back.  Both seemed about the same speed, but PNY was really slow.  Don't like to put too many pictures on one card because something could go wrong and all pictures would be lost.  Also, different cards could be used for different subject areas.     The number of pictures that memory will hold depends on the mega pixel setting on your camera. My camera will hold about 900 pictures with a 1 GB memory card and a setting of 3 mega pixels. It will take 84 minutes of video at 30 fps.  Could use a 5.2 mega pixel setting, but there would be no improvement in picture quality.     The best way to move pictures to and from a memory card and a computer is with a card reader.  If there are no memory card slots on your computer, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6 each on Tuesday and Wednesday.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.

Ha!  I'm the same way.  Currently have my eye on a 46" plasma, a new iPhone and a Wii.  What's wrong with us?    I put together a list of products you'd need to go from nothing at all to HD, but with value and budget in mind:    http://www.amazon.com/The-Best-Hi-Def-Ho...    1.) I have the 40GB PS3.  It's no longer made.  Although you may be able to find a 20GB, 40GB or 60GB--some of which were backwards compatible--currently Sony only makes the 80GB ($399) and 160GB ($499) models.  I'd go with the 80GB.  If you ever need more room you can install a larger hard drive yourself for less than $100.    2.) TV - I have a 32" 720p Samsung LCD right now.  I have my eye on the Panasonic Viera TH-46PZ85U.  It's a 46" 1080p plasma.  There are better HDTVs out there (i.e. Pioneer Kuro), but I'm all about bang for the buck.  This Panasonic is a really good value.  Cnet likes it too.    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/det...    3.) Surround sound - Forget Bose.  The systems suck.  The speakers are OK, but they're way overpriced.  You're paying for commercials and b.s. image.  If you want to DIY, go with the products on my list.  It's reflects what I have in my home and I stand by it.  If you want a bundled package (aka HTIB), go with the Onkyo HT-S6100.  It's fully HD compatible and will only cost you around $600.    EDIT: If $1,000 is too steep, check out the Samsung LN-32A550.  It's a 32" 1080p LCD.  Amazon is selling it for $758 today, although it was $50 less 2 weeks ago.    http://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0014...    It's a great TV if 32" is good enough for you.

PS3 get the cheapest. Hard drives can be easily upgraded    2. Go Plasma or PJ( You can get a nice 720p projector off ebay for around 700. Get a Sanyo PLV5, PLV4, or Panasonic AE900 or higher.     You can DIY on the screen or project it on the wall. :-)    The LCD Projectors can be shelf mounted! And you won't find a TV with that big of a picture anywhere!    3. Bose sucks. Don't ever buy a speaker from them. Period. They don't play a full range of sound. KEF, Infinity, JBL, SVS, Mirage, Martin Logan, Anthony Gallo, Paradigm, Polk, Klipsch, EMP, The Speaker Company, and many other make better speakers than Bose at a fraction of the cost. Bose sells their products on hype and marketing not true quality.

Plasma vs LCD(most videophiles prefer Plasma)  http://www.audioholics.com/education/dis...    You can go cheap and used. If you want to go that route. an old Panasonic HE100(my old receiver) goes for less 100 as a receiver. Then throw in 2  Infinity Beta 20s off ebay and a 250 for the center(my fronts). Grap 3 Kef 1000 satellites from accessories4less and you have a nice cheap 6.1 home theater.    If you can afford an www.svssound.com system then go that route. You could even just get 5 speakers without the sub and add a Dayton 12" from parts-express. That would hold you over until you can afford or build a better sub. I currently use a Dayton 10" while I'm building 2 Kappa perfect ported subs.     Another option is to buy a 5.1 set of EMPs or from the speaker company.     All the above options will be better than a HTIB.

3yvuMkzTaa	when you try to activate it, verizon will ask for the IMEI number. When it comes back as stolen, you will be in the possession of stolen property!!!|`|2LfMvxwBaa	Why? You shouldn't steal phones...|`|E0rJfuZcaa	Of course you can: just go the nearest police station, they'll help you out.|`|WJRise7taa	Yes, I have a different phone company and my phone was stolen, the little sh*t who had it charged up $89 worth of music and apps before I could get it turned off, then when it was off my account they activated in their name. I couldn't do anything about it cause I didn't have the receipt or the box with the esn number. So someone can activate a phone if they have the esn.|`|KXfGa4Quaa	nope.. i guess you're out of luck.    it'll pop up at verizon that it was stolen and you'll get busted.  best thing to do would be sell it to some poor kid and get them in trouble.
WJRise7taa	Wow, the only way to do that it to delete your pictures or some of your older music.
wK2DE2kbaa	maybe whoever told you that was talking about the shivering isles|`|rLuKkSpeaa	i have never heard of that but my brother plays that game nonstop you could ask him over xbox live his tag is White Boy 8908|`|kOrYXVedaa	I'm not sure,becuase of that,i suggest you go to these sites:    cheatcc.com/games/x360/ Elder Scrolls: Oblivion /hints  neoseeker/x360/games/ Elder Scrolls: Oblivion   cheatguru/games/x360/ Elder Scrolls: Oblivion   cheatplanet/games/ Elder Scrolls: Oblivion|`|bYzWWOQXaa	Perhaps it's too simple of an answer, but are you talking about the Shivering Isles expansion? The portal to the quest is on an island in the middle of a lake, and the people in that dimension are insane. I haven't heard of anything else similar.|`|924cab6fa10b9e6f74864d845336998baa	Yes, It appears after you install the expansion pack "Shivering Isle's"  It is available for about $10-15  after you install it to your hard drive, you should never have to mess with the "Shivering Isles" disk again.  It adds alot more game play to Oblivion.
UAYzLyN4aa	GSM in the US operates on two bands, called 850 and 1900 MHz.  In most of the rest of the world one or two other bands are used, 900 and 1800. A quad-band phone obviously covers all four.     A tri-band phone leaves out one of the four. You have to read the specs to know which one is left out. A lot of older tri-band phones leave out 850, as it is relatively new for GSM. Newer tri-band phones sold in the US will more commonly leave out one of the ROW bands, usually 900.     If you plan to use international roaming with your phone, getting both 900 and 1800 coverage is very important.     In the United States, 850 MHz coverage can be very important. The GSM 850 band is not older than 1900, it is newer, and GSM 850 MHz usage is NOT diminishing!  A lot of areas, particularly rural, are covered only by 850 MHz, because it takes roughly half as many towers to cover an area with 850 than with 1900.  If you stay mostly in cities and along major highways this might not matter to you, but there it is.      850 is used in some downtown areas too, as it penetrates buildings better. No way would I get a phone that doesn't cover 850.     Again, a "tri band' phone in the US might cover 850, 1900, and just one of the ROW bands (900 or 1800). Usually such a phone will leave out 900. This is because a lot of manufacturers were making 900/1800/1900 phones before the US started using GSM 850, and it was fairly easy to replace the 900 radio with an 850 radio. So a tri band phone does not necessarily mean you're giving up 850.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	The number of frequencies it can use.  A quad band phone can use the 850 frequency while a tri band cannot...Only AT&T and T-Mobile still use the 850 and in very limited areas.
CKRfaRYvaa	Ordering online requires a credit card for verification purposes.  As long as the screen says the phone is free, you will not be charged anything.  This is just a security measure to give them some way to trace it if the phone is ordered fraudulently.  As long as you are authorized by the account holder to make the purchase, you'll be fine.|`|7uISqpLCaa	Phone Plans always have loopholes. So if you buy the phone online, it will be free but it probably will cost you a 2 year plan and mail in rebate which also costs. So in the end, the phone is free but you have other things such as 2 year plan and mail in rebate that cost.   If you go to the verizon wireless store than I am assuming the same thing.   - Hope this helps!|`|FncktQ4gaa	Generally going to a Verizon store is the same price check the phone online first however most stores will not give you the instant rebate you get online. It comes in the form of a debit card later. If you are new to the account they will probably want you to pay up front also

K0YgJQgWaa	Here is one way:    http://www.ehow.com/how_4451456_buff-pla...|`|X4hz3a9haa	No, looking at the instructions i got with my TV they strongly recommend that you DON'T use anything that's going to mark the screen, and that you should only use a damp cloth to remove stubborn marks.|`|qvl3PjdEaa	I'm guessing it's a flat screen with a somewhat felt like texture on the screen.    I have a flat screen LCD an my cat has scratched it with it's collar rubbing on it. As far as I know there is nothing to get rid of scratches on something which is so delicate. On things like hard plastic then sure no problem, it'd just buff the scratch to smooth the surface and match it, but with more delicate plastics or the screen itself -- should it be a LCD/Plasma etc -- then I highly doubt there is anything.    Always follow the manual instructions for cleaning.    Sorry to hear your TV is scratched.    Peace    FX
621WF3xoaa	Unless you have your mind set on getting a Wii then just go for a PS3! Far better.

Hope this help.|`|AA11045021	Well, it depends on what kind of games you play. Hardcore gamers would despise this system because 95% of the games on the Wii are for little kids. There's a few jewels like Super Mario Galaxy and Super Smash Bros. Brawl. If you're a casual gamer, you might enjoy this.    I say it's well worth the money if it's what you're looking for.|`|jPB4tHx4aa	Whether or not it's worth the money is up to you. To me, it's definitely NOT worth that cash. I picked up mine for 100 US dollars used off of a friend. I wouldn't have paid a penny more for it.     It has a severely limited game library, more junk then gems. Mario Galaxy, Smash Bros. Brawl are probably the best games available, and they've all been out now for over a year.     It's also going to depend on your taste for games. Do you like casual games like Wario Ware's Smooth Moves? Or do you like more hardcore games like CoD4, GTAIV, MGS, Gears of War, God of War, etc...     If you're more of a casual gamer.. maybe this is the right console for you, if not... stay away from it.|`|GxaGHGBNaa	Its only 120 odd you must be looking at the multipack deals.|`|D2sMKkchaa	Yes,it is worth buying one they are great you can get games like:Animal Crossing,Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games 2008,Super Mario Galaxy(  :)|`|qaPyaFUcaa	200 is a ripoff.  you should get one from the store for retail price.  I guess it's good if you would play it once a week or probably less than that.  Otherwise it gets boring too quick.|`|GJycKc5Laa	i recomend getting the PS3 it has a huge library of games and the best are soon to come out this year. i bought one not to long ago and i love it. also if ur a online gamer i recomend this one over the 360 because the online playability is completely free. (unless u want to buy extras) but anyways the wii isnt worth it. buy a ps3|`|kpaEzVCpaa	It's definitely worth the money. The Wii has been the best console I've ever had and I've never had any problems with it.    Save up your money and buy a Wii.
8QhPUxllaa	You would have to buy a phone which is either on three or unlocked.  as unlocked phones mean that you can put any network sim inside it and it will work.  For unlocked phones though you have to buy it from a company like carphone warehouse as if you buy a phone from the 02 shop then it won't be unlocked to every network as obviously they want you to use them!    Good luck and hope that helped.|`|qfUnwHyFaa	it should do   i used an o2 sim in an orange unlocked phone.  and im on contract X|`|4biGrjPkaa	I dont think so, 3 phones are network specific so far as I'm led to believe.|`|dSQxCGbJaa	If the phone is unlocked, then you should be able to use your contract sim card no probs.

AA11525080	iPods don't get viruses , You messed it up when you plugged it into a Mac. You will need to restore it.|`|GVzeszQLaa	When you first plugged your ipod in you plugged it in to a windows computer. That is the problem because your ipod is formatted to windows when you plug it in to a pc or when you plug it into a mac it is formatted for the mac. When you plugged it into the mac it probably had problems because it was formatted to work with windows. To change it, when you plug it into the mac it will probably have a message about the format. It should have an option to change it, then change it!    Hope I helped.    xx
TwIK4Ivlaa	It's more than sufficient. You'll require a good internet connection though to make full use of this webcam at 30fps.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	30 fps is close to the speed of light|`|Lyl3mHIKaa	fps has changed from the old feet-per-second to modern frames-per-second and it states how many pictures are being taken in one second, the speed at which it is taking pictures.    30 fps is good for showing motion, on a wen cam.    Even half that at 15 fps will be adequate for most web cam purposes.  60 fps is very fast and like a regular movie, largely unnecessary for a web cam as most action happens slowly and you don't want to bog down your internet connection, or that of others.  60 fps is probably more suited for a helmet cam than a web cam, get it?

But, these phones suck.|`|VEw6Z4Gcaa	AT&T service is pretty okay. On average you'll have anywhere from Best to Moderate voice and data service. However, based off of my own personal experience I found Verizon has the BEST service in New York State hands down!     Also, I found that their service is semi dependent on the phone you have. With At&t's Blackberry 8310 service was good, yet with the iphone 3g service was choppy.     But in all honesty, i think if you get At&t you won't be disappointed and you'll be very happy with their service.    Good Luck =]

Ae5IYHjVaa	Yea...you may need a slingbox or such....I can do it with either my XBox360 or PS3....|`|Ces5k5R7aa	it depends on your video card.      to tie "hd" and "computer" together consider this:  1080p, 1080i, 720p are all just resolutions (e.g. 1024x768 on your desktop settings).    So if you're running into an regular VGA input in your TV..  1080p (or "full HD") would be 1920x1080.  Check your tv settings to see if your tv can handle that setting, and if so, change your desktop to that resolution. (if your video card can handle it).    If you have a DVI out on your video card you'll need a DVI to HDMI cable.  in this case your video card will probably let you select a resolution like 1080i or 720p.

tHjBr4L4aa	Since you asked this in the Camera forum:    1. Adjust your camera's exposure, dependent upon where the lens is aimed.  Dark clouds may require a higher ISO, and bright lava can cause overexposure. Compensate as needed by checking your lcd review screen after each shot.  2. If you are shooting skies filled with ash, be sure you have a protective UV or 1a filter to protect the front element of the lens.  There are also weatherproof hoods or cases for most cameras.  3. Use a wide angle lens to capture the vastness of the destruction.  4. A very, very long telephoto is great to get closer images of the eruption, while keeping you and your expensive camera equipment at a safe distance.  5. A tripod is handy, but I'd recommend a monopod for stability.  A monopod will allow you to run faster as the lava surges towards you.  6. Practice with the controls and menus of your camera, as standing before an erupting volcano is no place to whip out the owner's manual.  7. Don't change DSLR lenses, if possible, as the ash in the air can cause major problems with your digital sensor.  8. There may be a great deal of ground-shaking, so I'd suggest turning on your camera or lens' vibration reduction/image stabilization to compensate.  Usually this is turned off for tripod or monopod situations, but this scenario isn't a typical one.  9. Don't leave your camera bag laying open, as a couple of hot embers or some volcanic ash can wreck havoc with your photo equipment.  10. Bring water, as you'll need to hydrate yourself.  You may also need to pour water over your hands before packing your equipment away.  The fine volcanic ash will coat every surface (see Mt. St. Helens, for example) and is extremely abrasive.  Any ash on or in your photo equipment would be very destructive, so be careful.    But most of all, enjoy your photo opportunity, as it's not likely to be repeated soon!    p.s. Be prepared to be crowded, wherever you are, by scores of Japanese photographers.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Tokyo will be in trouble.|`|HBNx77BBaa	The battery in your camera goes flat.|`|Lyl3mHIKaa	I'm not an expert, but I can only imagine an awful lot of damage and loss of life.

(Also i've seen the 650 on sale for around $1500...  rare, but it can be done.  other than that 1800 is probably a good price)    I, of course, went with the 47" 120Hz Vizio from Sam's club for $998, but that's because i'm cheap.|`|nEuQVkigaa	I have worked at Best Buy for 5 years now and am in the TV department. The 750 and the 650 have absolutely no difference between them other than the frame that surrounds them. The resolution is the same and both sets feature the wonderful 120hz engine. This means that the pixels refresh 120 times per second, twice the speed of most LCD's. The sharp in my opinion is no competition to either of the two Samsungs.

5lnwpiyAaa	It depends on what kind of phone you have. All cell phone carriers have a website that you can go to, and there should be an "accessories" category where you can buy the specific headset for your phone.   For example:  If you have a verizon phone: go to verizon.net  if you have sprint: go to sprint.pcs.com  etc...    Good luck (=
mZlPj8Guaa	I reset mine with the menu and center button. I hold it down for a good 3 or 4 seconds. The unit will respond (Hopefully).|`|U3GQNrrzaa	thats their way of making you get a new one|`|HeMhMQmEaa	If a Nano:  Step 1:  -Press Menu Button and Center Button, for Six Seconds  -Then Wait for apple logo, wait for it to come up.  Step 2:  If it doesn't come up, then it's broken,try again, then if all fails go to the apple store and they can give you a quote to fix it. If it is more than a new iPod get a new one.  ______________________________________...  If It's a Video:  Step 1  -Slide the Hold switch to HOLD and back again. Press the  Menu and Center buttons at the same time for about 6  seconds, until the Apple logo appears.  Step 2  If it doesn't come up, then it's broken,try again, then if all fails go to the apple store and they can give you a quote to fix it. If it is more than a new iPod get a new one.
rB86DhJiaa	I would definitely agree with the ipod. There are other options out there at "better deals" but they are not worth the hassle. With the ipod you won't have to worry about software (you can get itunes for free, plus practically everyone has it now anyways), it will work on a mac or pc, you can take it to the apple store if there are problems... etc. They last longer too. Seems everyone gets an ipod in the end.     Of the ipods, the classic is definitely the best ipod looking at price per gig. However, because it has an actual hard drive, don't buy this one if you are planning on running with it. The nano is extremely popular and not too bad price-wise. The touch is great but more expensive and has many more features than just playing mp3s.    I have had my classic for 4 years now. It still works, still looks brand new (I also recommend a case) and I use it everyday. I am obsessed with music.    My last recommendation is about the size. If you are looking at the nano, I would get the 16g for $50 more than the 8g. I can't tell you how many people I know said I will never need 16 gigs and bought the 8 and eventually filled it and said they wished they got the 16g. You cant add more gigs unfortunately. Think about this too, you double the size for a third of the price more. Great deal.|`|6s0IZdv8aa	Get the ipod classic. ipods are the best quality mp3 players out there, just buy a case for it because if you drop it it will get scratched very easily. That's probably the only thing I hate about ipods. I've had my ipod for about 5 years without any problems until I got my ipod touch with is the best ipod you can get.
9nCPjRxcaa	Sounds faulty.  call binatone
hJP9y6kjaa	If you get that Viper set up professionally and upgrade the pickups, I'm betting it will sound and play just as good as any Gibson you'd be looking at.    I took my EC-100QM (ha ha el cheapo) and had it professionally set up, rewired, new pickups (Seymour Duncan Alnico II Pro in the neck and Alternative 8 in the bridge), an onboard buffer circuit installed (a specific type of preamp)... In the end, I play it side by side with guitars that are much more expensive, and it sounds and plays better than most.    I brought it to Guitar Center the other day and plugged into a few different amps, while my buddy plugged in a guitar loaded with EMGs... he was just shaking his head the whole time, since I'd be plugging in and getting these huge, full distorted chunky rhythms and whatnot... He got even more appreciation out of it when I showed him how well both pickups coil-tapped, and just how versatile of a sound I could get out of it...     Sure, it cost a bit of scratch, but since I paid less than 300$ for the guitar, and spent just under 300$ for the custom work, it's still cheaper than most decent guitars, and most guitars still need aftermarket pickups to sound really good anyways....    If the neck works for you, I'm telling you, all it takes is a bit of selection to find the right pickups and sometimes other wiring/electronics to turn your guitar from a "bleah" to a "hell yeah!"        Saul|`|cQklLbL1aa	Gibson makes Epiphone guitars, and some of the Epiphione necks are slighty thinner than the Gibson models.I have been playing both the Gibson and the Epiphones for years, and to be honest, sometimes the Epiphone beats the higher priced Gibsons.
LCbYG99Raa	Might help if u tell us what kind of phone it is?! lols  xx|`|Upcbl25waa	thats a toughie!!! if u have a mem card in it take it out cuz itll give it less to "think" about lol! try leaving it turned off for a good few hours (take battery out too id say!) and the break might do it some good! if u manage to get it back on delete any unnecessary stuff in the fone esp txts! if u have no luck bring it into a store and they might be able to do a repair if its under warranty!
7XGa9zcdaa	It will work, just not with stereo sound.  On composite cables (red,white, yellow) the yellow corresponds to video, which is very important and you will need this to see any image.      The sound is split between the red and white cables.  If you plug in both, you will have stereo sound output.  If you plug in only one, you will still have sound, just mono sound.      So your TV will work just fine.|`|VQdqFT5Uaa	Yes, it will still work.  The important plug is the yellow one, it is for video.  The red and white are for stereo, if you only plug in 1 you just won't hear stereo sound, but will still be able to play and hear the game in mono.

If you borrowed or rented the video, it is technically illegal, although it is unlikely that you will be nailed for it.

kXF6JBFLaa	You could get a DVD recorder. They're cheap, but I don't know what you mean by "cheerful". Use rewritable DVDs (DVD-RW or DVD+RW) and you'll have the closest analogue to a VCR. Just make sure to get one with a built-in QAM tuner so it can tune digital cable.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Connect the second tv/video to the S-VHS or RCA jacks output on the cable box.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	You can buy a DVR from the store that will handle "plain old cable TV".  If you have digital cable, the DVR won't be able to pick up those channels.    This DVR won't have as many features as the one from you cable company.  For instance, it won't be able to record a show by name.  You'll have to tell it what day, time, channel and duration you want to record - just like the old VCRs.  Still, you won't be paying a service fee for this.    Simply connect the DVR to your cable in the other room.  You may want to get a splitter so your DVR can record 1 channel while your TV watches a different channel.  Also, don't forget to connect the DVR to your TV so you can watch recorded shows.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	If your DVR has a coaxial output, then use that (and add a splitter if you need more) - but all connected TV's will receive whatever is happening on the DVR. If you add a splitter in front of the DVR than the other TV can view channels independently.
G8Po13Uaaa	Well seeing you are on a tight budget, I am going to recommend some good games that are under $30 used at gamestop    Bioshock  Assassins Creed  Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion  Gears of War ( the first one)  Condemned 2: Bloodshot  Burnout Paradise  Guitar Hero 3  Fight Night Round 3    these are just some of the great games that are cheap now, I would highly recommend Bioshock out of any game on my list, cause it is an amazing game, the graphics are simply amazing, the story line sinks you into the game. Bioshock was Game of the Year in 2007 also, it has received a 10 out of 10 by alot of critics.  Well worth it.|`|LKiVXEcCaa	first off check the used games, EB games or Gamestop usually has used games, they're cheaper and have titles like halo and gears 2. That's where I got half my games. I'd go for gears 2, real time battle style|`|l5AOEcZ4aa	Buy Kane and Lynch $24|`|eAFbIiWWaa	i say it is a good game. I think it has the same expectations as halo but the game really hasnt shown|`|Kemz9EBraa	Gears of war   or dead space|`|849gv8khaa	if your a halo person, id buy the whole series. you can usually get them for cheap at gamestop. i enjoyed and still enjoy the need for speed, if your a driver game type of person. i heard the call of dutys are fantastic. also any other 1st person shooter are fun and usually pretty tactical. ive enjoyed all of the splinter cells. gears of war 1 & 2 are awesome games, also left for dead and fallout are also suppost to be great "just comeing out" games. if your into halo like i said before theyre coming out with Halo wars. its kinda like the old final fantasy version of it. where you move a piece and play that way. ive never liked games like that cuz im really not an RPG person but if you are you may enjoy that. the new resident evil thats out or is coming out is suppost to be gory from what i hear.also any of the guitar heros/rock bands. theyre addicting and each have theyre own style. and street fighter are also out and you could try. dead space was suppost to be fantastic and kinda graphic from what ive heard. ive never played it. also the condemed series, ive always enjoyed the suffering series, not that great but i enjoyed them. i also enjoyed black but most people didnt enjoy that either. assassins creed and bioshock were both rated a 10 with consumers so they were both great. i never finished bioshock but it for some reason freaked me out and i never finished it.back to the rpg's if your into those games i suggest fable and oblivion. oblivion can be pretty lengthy so they will eat a huge chunk of your time away.   the classics for xbox original you could always find and find cheap. fi i was you if your not looking to spend a lot of money if you want rent em' out at blockbuster and if your willing to spend the money on the game, then youve already played and either enjoyed or hated it. i tryed to give you a wide variety to the list of games that i played and to the games that ive never tryed or played just cuz im not that type of gamer. but i hope you enjoy.|`|g54tGcRvaa	Gears of War 2 was worth it!|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	If you like adventure, get Assassin's Creed.

The thing I didn't like about the Krave was that it's a touch screen only.  It didn't seem to work as well as like the Blackberry Storm would.  I also watched a video on youtube for  each one and liked the Env2 better.

imaeeL9Naa	Sure can.    You will need: An Ethernet cable (like the one included with your Xbox), a pc/laptop connected to the internet via wifi, and of course an Xbox.     It might be beneficial to set your firewall to a low setting.    Next is to enable ICS.    1. Click Start, click Control Panel, click Network and Internet, click Network and Sharing Centre and then, on the left, click Manage network connections.    2. Right-click on your wireless connection, and then click Properties.    3. Click the Sharing tab and enable the 'allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection' option. Click ok.    Now connect the Ethernet cable to your pc and to your Xbox. Give it a minute to connect and then on your Xbox go to the system tab and click network settings. Next click 'test Xbox live connection'. If everything worked as it should the test should finish ok except the NAT settings will be set to strict.     This is the point where most people get stuck. Strict means that your router is not letting certain information through. You can still connect to Xbox live and play some games but other features will not work (voice chat, ranked games ECT...)     The only way to set NAT to open is to open certain ports on your router so the information will be allowed through (this is called port forwarding), however port forwarding will not work when you are connected through this method. The only way it will work is to bridge your wireless connection and you Local Area Connection.    1. Click Start, click Control Panel, click Network and Internet, click Network and Sharing Centre and then, on the left, click Manage network connections.    2. Right-click on your wireless connection, and then click Properties.    3. Click the Sharing tab and DISABLE the 'allow other network users to connect through this computer's internet connection' option. Click ok.    A NETWORK BRIDGE WILL NOT WORK WITH ICS ENABLED.    4. Disconnect for your internet connection (or switch of wifi if your laptop has a switch for it). YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BRIDE A CONNECTION IF YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET.    5. Highlight the Local Area Connection and the Wireless Network Connection, right click and either of them and select bridge connection. When complete you can reconnect to the internet.    6. Open any webpage just to make sure you can still connect to the internet.     Test your Xbox live connection again, just to make sure it is connecting. You NAT settings will still be set to strict, so now you must open the correct ports.     1. On your pc go to your router homepage (open internet explorer/firefox and go to 192.168.1.254).    2. Click custom services on the left and in the service name dropdown box select Xbox live games. It will be near the bottom of the list. Click enable and in the select host device dropdown box select the pc your Xbox is connected to. Click enable.    And youre done. Test your Xbox live connection again just to be sure but your NAT settings should be set to open.|`|huto12P3aa	You probably can, if you can thro your pc|`|ZdZlNAa2aa	Yeh, if you have internet connection, http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/|`|94Q4QGleaa	You can login at www.xbox.com by clicking the "sign in" button in the upper right hand corner.

ioKKaSvEaa	Just choose o2 its great!!!!|`|J6hMlpncaa	I know for a fact the best coverage and the fastest network for Mobile Broadband is Vodafone, I was lucky enough to test all providers so have experienced the good bad and ugly (3 network - don't even consider)    You can have a contract option however from points 3 and 4 you are best off with a Top Up and Go option.    So on Vodafone you pay for a USB Dongle 39 and it comes with free 1GB of usage worth 15    so instead of having a monthly bundle each month you just pay for what you use!   Just top up 15 for another 1GB as and when you need it.    You can plus in the USB dongle to any laptop or desktop as long as it has a USB port so you can take it with you and use where ever you are!
RpCwfcRzaa	Transfer cables are only for hard drive to hard drive. Once you attach the hard drive, it will be listed under your system's memory devices. The internal one should be too. On the system section of My Xbox (if using the new NXE version of the dashboard) or on the system blade ( the purple blade if using the old dashboard) all of your memory devices are listed. There should be an option to copy or move saves found on your internal memory and then select the new hard drive as the place to put them. This is how it works with a memory card and a hard drive, but I haven't had a chance to look at the new Arcade with internal memory yet. If this doesn't work, you will need to buy or borrow a memory card and move the info from the internal to the card and then over to the hard drive in the same way as I already mentioned.

You can also design a simple 555 timer and or op-amp circuit that outputs a continous 1000hz signal if you want a no frills circuit.  You may even find kits on the web.  http://www.national.com/nationaledge/jun...|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Loudspeakers put out frequency ranges and can't be designed to put out one specific frequency. You could build a simple resonant circuit with a capacitor and coil that can be tuned to 1000 Hz by using the right capacitance and inductance values. But, the speaker will still reproduce any other frequencies going to it.    The only way to get a pure 1000 Hz signal out of a speaker is to send a pure 1000 Hz signal to it. To do this, you would need an audio signal generator tuned to 1000 Hz going to your amplifier and then to your speaker.|`|475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	You need an "audio oscillator" - there are some free ones online.

ZQeXKdrAaa	I don't know what you're looking at, but it's best not to go by specs but actual user reviews.  In that price range, I STRONGLY recommend either Koss PortaPros or Sennheiser PX100s.  Both are great headphones and the two top dogs in their price range.   PortaPros are well-known for the ridiculous amount of bass they have, you will not be disappointed if you buy a pair of them.    EDIT:  I didn't realize you were looking for earbuds, I didn't see that.  Sorry.  Try some CX300s, they're around $30 and they have plenty of bass.    Also, if anyone ever recommends Skullcandy to you, just walk away.  They're garbage.

RvXwjC7Yaa	Solution.    Im pretty glad you asked this question because iv'e been wanting to know how to do it for a long time and ive finally found out:)    An ipod only takes music from i tunes, it does NOT play mp3 or mp4 music unless the track is asociated with itunes.    For this, there is only one way you can get free music associated with itunes on your ipod- Using a file converter.    The way this works is you convert youtube videos into itune downloadable files, so basically, you search the song you want from youtube (get a HQ one) highlight the URL and copy it- Once that is done, go onto http://zamzar.com/url/   and where it says 'step 1',  paste the URL ino the little box- then where it says step 2 click on the arrow, scroll down until you find 'ipod' and click on it- then where it says 'step 3' type in your email adress and then click 'convert', now you need to wait for a few minutes until zamzar converts the file and sends it to your email address, once that done, you go onto your email address and open the message from zamazar, click on the link given by them, you then will be redirected to zamzar's site where it'll say 'download file' and bam your done with that file, so now you can send it to your ipod!  (sometimes the converted file takes some time to be sent to your email address, oh, and you have 24 hours to download your file once its sent, if the time goes over this limit and you have'nt downloaded it, you'll have to do it all over again)      There is another way you can download free music, go to http://90percentoffamazon.googlepages.co...    scroll down until you see the 'music lemon' thing, you just search the song you want and download it, easy as that, and its completely free, but to put it on your ipod you must do what i told you above but instead on going on http://zamzar.com/url/  you need to go on http://zamzar.com/    instead....on step 1 just click on browse and click on your downloaded file from the 90percent site i gave you, and do the same thing....Easy!!!  i really hope this helped, took me agggeessss to type up!  good luck!|`|KvmjaU86aa	There's alot of free music on the web through various downloading  programs. I personally use Limewire or Utorrent for my downloads. The music you have can be converted through itunes so it can be compatible with your ipod.

xQjToANXaa	Both are touchscreen phones but viewty is better regarding camera and battery stand-by. Viewty has expandable memory up to 2GB while cookie is lacking in camera with only 3.15 mp and 350h stand-by inspite of being updated version. So I think viewty is good stuff to be tasted.  http://l8shop.net/products/Sim_Free_LG_K...

However if you want a full touch-screen experience, the Cookie would be a better choice.  The cookie can hold up to 16GB microsd while the viewty only a 2gb microsd.      If you want to compare the other features of both these phones, follow the link pasted below.    But as of a choice between these 2, I would go with the Cookie.    http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idP...|`|AHY3UUIiaa	I wouldnt recommend getting an LG phone.

And a few of my friends with the same phone had the same problems. Orange never helped fix my phone or i had to pay 300pound to upgrade or i can wait till April 27th to get new phone for free.  Waste of space!

5lnwpiyAaa	I have the LG rumor phone (=  I don't have the memory card though, but I'm pretty sure that if you plug the usb cord into your phone (not included) just save the pics onto your computer, and then copy them into the memory card when your phone is plugged in.    I hope you know that the phone did not actually come with a memory card. You bought one separately right? Just checking to make sure you know that.

w4I9oj2Maa	Alignment ICs generally cost about $300 to $330 for parts and labor and trip to your home...of course that's a local trip.    How easy is it?  Well if you're skilled at soldering, you wouldn't have any problems with it...    Unless of course the ICs have dried out the heatsink compound and they are now cemented to the heatsink...THEN you REALLY have to know what you're doing to pry those off !    A good technician will know how to remove those without damaging the Circuit board.

e8e0e4cc6750f11d7eebfe0f3af8eb0daa	You seem to be asking about a ferroresonant transformer.  You can use this type of transformer with electronics.  There is an advantage to this type of transformer, but there are 2 shortcomings with them.  A ferroresonant transformer does a better job of filtering noise than a standard transformer.  Unfortunately, they are inefficient, wasting more energy than a standard transformer and they also create a lot of heat.  If you use this type of transformer make sure it's well ventilated.    The web site below has a very good article on transformers.  The ferroresonant transformer article is just over half way down the page.

STUsNoNTaa	If you have more hdmi equipment than you have inputs you can get a hdmi splitter from e bay or another   supplier to give you the input commections you need the sound should pass through these to the home theatre unit to give you proper sound whichever item you are using and connect the 360 by component cable and it should do the same|`|AA10616019	Ideally, if your receiver has enough HDMI inputs and a HDMI output, you should put everything through the receiver and then HDMI to TV.  In fact, get a HDMI cable for the 360, too.    Unfortunately, this isn't always possible.  If you have too many HDMI inputs for your receiver, you'd need to run the HDMI cables to the TV and then use optical or other outputs on your sources to connect them to the receiver.  While the TV has optical audio output, it does not pass through surround sound - it will downgrade everything to stereo except for TV.    It sounds like you might be confused about running audio to the TV.  You don't do that if you have a receiver.  You go to your TV's settings and disable speakers/sound - unless your receiver doesn't have speakers, in which case you don't need a receiver and you should plug everything into the TV.

8XS7xeiXaa	if you have texting you can just enter your email address into the recipients area & it'll send the pictures straight to your email address & you can download them to your computer.      that's how i do it.
Gnu7w3K8aa	It all depends on the type of viewer you are.    If you are a casual viewer, then you will probably be okay with a simple calibration that you can do through any THX certified DVD I'm sure you already own (Star Wars, Pixar movies are just a few).  You just simply go to the section on the DVD and follow the onscreen instructions and your picture will likely look better (not extremely better, but it will probably improve).  Or AVIA and DVE (Digital Video Essentials) are some discs you can buy for some more thorough self calibration.     If you are a major movie buff, and plan on spending a whole lot of time in front of the screen, I would recomend ISF calibration, which usually sets you back $300 or more.  P.S.  If you don't want to do either of these, then you should select the mode in your T.V. usually referred to as Movie, or Cinema, or something like that.  This is usually better because the default of most TV's, LCD or otherwise, tends to be rather bright in order to stand out in the major electronics stores.|`|H8tsynxTaa	you tend to get more from calibration on plasmas then u do on lcds...so for lcds i would say its just a wast of money|`|qGfAlDd2aa	The factory settings are good enough for the vast majority of home users.  In a stand alone situation, where you don't have two displays next to each other for comparison, people won't be able to tell the difference.  Calibration is a really high profit item for retailers so they push it pretty hard, especially in this economy.    We've been calibrating monitors in TV stations for years.  Even in that environment, we don't do all of them, just particular ones.  Save your money.

KLL0Acrwaa	Essentially, you're going to want a 35mm film camera, as that uses easy to find film that's relatively inexpensive to process and print.  While there are 120 film cameras available and you can find 120 film, processing and printing is much more problematic if there's no pro shops handy.    In terms of manual focus 35mm film cameras, I'd stick with just a few used ones.    Nikon FM2n.  One of the truly great cameras of all time.  Used, runs from $150 to $275.  Available in black or chrome.  Best of all, while it has electronic metering, the shutter speeds are purely mechanical--you can use the camera without batteries if you need to.  And it will take some of the best Nikon lenses made, including AF lenses that have an aperture ring.    Pentax K1000.  The classic student camera.  Takes a huge array of Pentax K-mount lenses, which were sold by a lot of other companies besides Pentax.  Built like a tank. Used, should be around $150.    Whatever used 35mm SLR you get, make sure it has good light seals.  As a camera ages, the light seals deteriorate.  Older cameras should be checked/cleaned by a pro, including having the seals replaced if needed and the shutter speeds checked for timing.    Now, if you're looking for an autofocus 35mm SLR, try the Nikon N80 or even the Nikon F100.  Both are high quality (i.e. not cheap plastic like the low-end Canon 35mm Rebels) and great performers.  For Canon, try the better Canon Elan 7 series cameras.  Again, make sure the light seals are intact in any used camera and that the shutter timing is accurate.    For vintage look, just change the film.  Try B&W film.  Try slide film.  You get the idea--the film affects the look of the image.    For Polaroid, try a Polaroid 360 packfilm camera.  Compatible packfilm by Fujifilm can be found at pro stores.      I don't know what part of "cheap" Empenage can't understand.  His choices are expensive.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	look for Bronica, Yashica, and Hassalblad, (large format cameras). look for reviews and prices in a web search. Hassalblad is like the Rolls Royce of cameras.|`|AA10722993	I would never buy any electronics from ebay.   Too many dishonest sellers on there.   You would be better off looking on Craigslist, or even going to a pawn shop where you can handle the camera and make sure it is in good shape.|`|567c6b249f5eaa8b96d284566ebe653faa	That's the wrong way to go at this point in time. Get you a used Nikon D1 professional camera in good working condition and one Lens such as 24 to 120mm zoom and learn it from ground up.

YHu0s3JZaa	I had the same thing.  And my router is fine.   It seems although this happens a lot.   There is no actual fix for it, but you can try taking the disk out and putting it back in.  That worked for me. And it also worked for everyone I helped on Y!Answers.   But there is no actual fix.   Yeah, the resetting your router might work, but it will only work for maybe less than a week.    It is actually the online server it is running on. The creator (Can't remember who) hasn't tried to update the servers. Meaning if they do not update/maintain the servers, people will have a problem connecting which could lead to a frozen PS3.     I Hope This Helped!    -Wiiplay_ds|`|Hiasgb75aa	The problem is that you net connection is too weak for it to download the game settings. Basically, find a way to speed up your internet connection. This happens with CoD4|`|6eROUvT1aa	no i had the same issue on my ps3 today with COD5! i resetted my wireless router then it worked, must be the connection?|`|iB9ROoOqaa	it's the internet connection.. be sure to check the router. i had the same problem COD5 . it taes forever to download the game settings and i couldn't play even the FREE-FOR-ALL match. i reset my router and it was all good. and if you're connecting wirelessly. i'd advice you to connect wirely althought it doesn't have nothing to do with ur problem but its better connection.|`|LSXdwRDUaa	it your connection. Turn the router off and turn it back off,  Always happened to me in COD5. I thought it the server, but it  was my router all along.
