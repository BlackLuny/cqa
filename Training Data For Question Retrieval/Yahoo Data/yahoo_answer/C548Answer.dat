WXExyAlWaa	Telling your mum is probably a very important step here. Unfortunately you have no way of knowing if she will be supportive, but she loves you and will want what is best for you overall. If she asks how you are (not when she's, like, just tossing it out on her way out the door obviously, but when she has time to listen) you could say "well, actually, I've been feeling kind of down lately." Otherwise you could bring it up yourself - "Mum, do you have time to talk? I need some advice."<br>  <br>  If you don't feel you can open a conversation about it, you could write down how you feel in a letter for her. That will give you more time to figure out how to say exactly what you mean to say, and she will be able to think about it and figure out how best to respond.<br>  <br>  I hope this works out for you.|`|jQz5vABzaa	She's your mother and she will love you regardless!<br>  Everyone passes through ups and downs and because you are asking what you can do to get better shows a sign of strength and determination! <br>  Go up to your mom calmly sit down and talk to her in a serious mature way.. Tell her what you feeling and ask for her help.. Explain what you're feeling! be frank and stay strong girl!<br>  <br>  Take good care now and DONT EVER think of hurting yourself..

Please keep in mind that I can't give you advice that will work 100%. <br>  <br>  You need to go to your mom and ask her to go to ice cream, coffee, dinner, it doesn't matter. Move someplace out of the house, you're aiming for neutral ground in this matter. You just need to tell her as straight-forwardly as you can, and you need to tell her how you've come to find these results and why you don't feel like it isn't hormones. You need to have the guff to back it up and don't get grumpy about it either. You need to stay as calm as possible and tell her exactly how you feel. Tell her that you want to go see someone about this, to get help for it. <br>  <br>  If you need me, please contact me via e-mail and I'll see if I can't give you advice via e-mail at: death_head102@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|eC9NUrBkaa	I'm 15 and i know exactly what you're going through <br>  i had to take the same test aswell and it came back over 21 (which means severly depressed) i used to think know one would notice if i was to die but i actually kept thinking about killing myself nearly everyday and after about 5-6 months of suffering with it i managed to tell my mom in a non suttle way that i wish a bus would run me over on the way to school (sounds stupid but it was really how i was feeling i just didnt want to live anymore)<br>  and she hugged me and took me to see my doctor who made me do the Depression Test and it came back i was severly depressed and i am now on 40mg of Fluoxitine and because i wasn't sleeping properly he put me on Temazapan too.<br>  as for the answer just explain to her how you feel <br>  it's nothing to be ashamed of, i think you should tell your mom and make an appointment at your nearest doctors.<br>  hope i helped <br>  Natalie <br>  xx
Eec9JeXbaa	of course you can get delays from stress etc...even when on the pill. However should you be getting back on the pill if you didn't get your period?? I usually wait a week extra to get the period, one week won't do any damage to the protection. <br>  <br>  However if there could be a chance you might be pregnant, check asap, so you don't keep taking the pill and damage the baby (if you'd keep it)|`|Q2dJhKJraa	Stress and Dieting can affect your period even if your on the pill. <br>  What do you mean "going back on the pill tomorrow" can you be possibly pregnant if you missed taking the pill a few days here and there?|`|tV4Yk6Wkaa	go and see your gp he will put your mind at rest.
fFqzD3aMaa	See a doctor|`|0jwXQPCoaa	When you're all stressed out, your food can't digest. It passes to your large intestine where it is digested by bacteria--and then you have gas. You probably also have some infection in your gut which will also go away, in time.<br>  <br>  Just don't freak out. I know that's easier said than done. In time this will pass.<br>  <br>  Do what you can to stop worrying and eat a healthy diet. This will make the problem go away a little more quickly. See if your parents will let you stay home from school for a few weeks. Your doctor can provide a note.<br>  <br>  The best answers for dealing with stress and anxiety are in the Bible.|`|b917e460c4bd4d15c5be28935e4b415faa	intestinal disorder perhaps???<br>  There is medication that can help that, so why the worry.|`|2Utx6skNaa	hmmm have you tried baby shampoo? lol i know it sounds weird but it gets all the bad junk off me and what excatly does this new smell smell like?<br>  and dont blam this on anyone it just happens sometimes you didnt do nothin wrong|`|QCOcls8caa	take Vitamin E pills, that should neutralize that smell. If it doesn't try a detox for 7 to 31 days like fruits and veggies and juice and dried fruits and water of course. If that doesn't work try working out and a combination of the things mentioned above and going into a sauna. If those don't work try searching on google on how to remove odors.But those above should help.|`|neUiCEB3aa	You're 15, so it's probably puberty. Guys continue to grow throughout their teen years. So, if you don't already, try showering in the morning before school. Carry deodorant in your backpack and leave it in your locker so that in between classes you can apply it. Maybe even bring a small hand towel to wipe yourself off between classes, too. Watch what kind of clothing material you wear, too. Wear something light, something that doesn't stick to your body; that way you stay cooler. <br>  <br>  If your doctor is hot, so what? She's your DOCTOR. You're supposed to tell her stuff like this so she can help. Silly.<br>  <br>  As for the thing of telling your mom, yeah, parents usually don't listen. So psh. Whatever. *shrugs* I don't know how to help you there.

bCudUSvtaa	Some ladies I work with just started taking vitamins from Juvenon?  It's supposedly a vitamin that helps with all the normal stuff, but has anti-aging benefits and boosts energy levels as well?  They've been taking it for a few weeks and have mixed reviews, but all of them like it (some are seeing more benefits than others I think)  They talk about it almost every day at lunch, and they forward me the newsletters they get, because I love all the science that goes into health stuff...  <br>  <br>  They all ordered online, I'm not sure if it's available in stores or not?  <a href="http://juvenon.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://juvenon.com/index.html</a> <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0JB4eb6raa	What about those prenatal vitamin?

FMuCItoeaa	Low potassium cooking is simple cooking - for example, baked chicken breast has much less potassium than chicken kiev or curried chicken, plain rice or pasta are healthier without cream or fancy sauces, oil and vinegar dressing is best for salads.<br>  <br>  Avoid salt substitutes, artificial sweeteners, bran, nuts, whole grain, milk, raisins, carrots, greens or beans, chocolate, prepared sauces, avocado, tomatoes, potatoes,  oranges, bananas, cantaloupe. <br>  <br>  Links show example diets, reduce them to 1600-1800 calories.

d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	I can answer this thanks to my bro who is more of a socialite. He started at a bit later than you and drank mainly at parties and so on. Sometimes he got **** face. The thing is he did not do it on a daily basis to say he is an alcoholic but all the weekends combined and a couple of decades later, he has a lot of health issues. None of them are life threatening but he almost got his foot amputated due to it. He also has some other issues that are quite serious.<br>  <br>  The thing is this. You may not feel the physical side effects yet but the partying will compound throughout your life and the effects will start showing later in life. So take that advice to be careful about what you do today because it will affect your future.<br>  <br>  I am a bit sad that you live in a place where drinking is the normal thing to do. Vegas might get you in a worse spot. When I lived there I noticed everyone had an addiction. Either smoking, gambling, drinking, or drugs. I did not meet anyone that was "clean". So beware when you go there and choose your friends wisely if you can.<br>  <br>  Besides that, a few school buddies are no longer alive due to alcohol but that is the same story everywhere. So on a personal level I think my bro's story is a good warning. As to him, he still drinks once in a while but it is rather seldom he does so. He has learned obviously.<br>  <br>  In a sense, at 21 you are still growing up and learning about many things. Take this issue about alcohol and learn from it. Hopefully, you control it more than it control you when you both meet at a party. Once you learn to control it, you wont be as impacted. Remember, everything is okay in moderation. As to how you act and feel afterwards, that is part of what alcohol does. Hence you need to be in control. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Cfw74k3xaa	you are asking the wrong people.... get a close person to talk to:) or you can just email me....|`|AA11492897	I wouldn't call you an alcoholic.  We can all do dumb things when we are drunk.  Try not to be too hard on yourself.  If you feel like you should limit yourself, you should really try to do that & stick to it.  At least you are aware of what is going on and that you aren't drinking all the time.
lkxFy681aa	Cut a potato in half, put a lil salt on it.<br>  Rub on face. (silly, but worth it)<br>  Do this twice a day, and it usually gets rid of a good portion within a week or so.<br>  <br>  Works well also against blackheads.<br>  Btw, there's no way to permanently stop the spots. Puberty is a beeeyatch.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Over-the-counter acne-removal products don't work -- they're literally just fake stuff designed to get you to pay for them.

I know how it feels going to school and putting tons of make up to make your face flawless. Use Aloe Vera (the plant), they sell this at some supermarkets, or you can even buy the plant and plant it in your backyard. Every night, cut a small piece, take out what's inside with a spoon, it will feel a little weird to the touch. Put it in every pimple you have and leave it all night, it will smell a bit funny. In the morning wash your face with any cleanser. Don't wear makeup!<br>  You might want to visit your dermatologist. Diferin and Benzaclin are great for acne.|`|xnxrpKAqaa	first, recipies might actually harm your skin if you don't use them properly. i tried a homemade scrub once and it actually cause me to break out more.<br>  second, if your so worried about acne why dont you see your dermatologist? that way they can see your skin for them selves and decide which med is right for you. don't even think about ordering products such as proactive or acnefree. they dont work on most types of skin. the usually only work on people who allready have clear skin and are just trying to prevent their skin from breaking out. <br>  third, if you do go to your dermatologist then ask for doxycycline. it works wonders on skin withtout drying it out because its a pill you take once a day.it also for some reason makes my hair shinyier.|`|6CNhhTsDaa	you don't make it but you can buy clean & clear i find it works|`|Nvx3IYYraa	For me i just have to wash my face with soap everyday.|`|PrgnX7Ngaa	No don't make it.

DI3u9gMSaa	I'm in my mid-20s and was very worried about my appearance.  Opted for Invisalign but things didn't turn out perfectly at the end, and I switched to traditional braces.  I'm really comfortable with them and what made my experience with them better is that I didn't (and still don't) care what people think.  After the first time your classmates see you with braces, they're not going to think about them the next time around.  Don't be insecure with them - just pretend it's like having glasses, some more extra gear.<br>  <br>  Metal braces are cheaper than Invisalign and more effective - go with metal.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	There are options other than metal...porcelain, Sapphire, ceramic etc. Metal is not that bad and lots of adults are wearing braces nowadays. good luck
Z79wWLpAaa	I Totally understand where you are coming from, I have the same exsact problem with getting overwhelmed and want to cry or just sit in my room for hours at a time by myself or just go home and sleep for the dayy, my grades dropped, im not talking to anyone and i was beginning to thinki was going crazyy =S when i have no reason to, But the reason for this is i have recentally found out that i have clinical depression. This has to be treated with medication becuase sometimes it can get soo bad that someone can have to think about commiting suicide, and you wouldnt want that to happen. Clinical depression comes from genetic problems, it runns in a family or someone that yourr closly related to, You should probebly see a doctor and talk to them about what you can do. I have medication and i find myself not having the short waves of depression or sometimes they last up to weeks where i will not talk to anyone at all. So see a docctor.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	Talk to your family|`|jIEdTCiBaa	Godddd. <br>  It is like talking to myself. <br>  You can try ignoring it (thats what i do - it doesn't work)<br>  you could tell your counselor. <br>  but what about your doc?<br>  couldn't he/she give you anti-depressants??<br>  x<br>  sorry i couldn't be of more help.
BRXg8Mcpaa	Absolutely!  L-Theanine is an amino acid that relaxes the muscles and calms the mind.  If you take 200mg about an hour before your speech, you will be cool as a cucumber.  It won't hurt you - so don't worry about anything.  Good luck!|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Nothing OTC, go see your doctor, be honest and he'll probably give you a pill or two.|`|D4ot0qLpaa	Some herbs are very calming; try looking up kava kava, passionflower, valerian, and chamomile - one of those should fit the bill. Be sure to only take the correct dose, and it's a good idea to try taking it at least once prior to the day itself so you'll know what your tolerance level is. Valerian in particular will make you very sleepy if you're sensitive to it. (Which might be useful for the night before!)<br>   <br>  Chamomile is the easiest to find; you can get chamomile tea, or an herbal tea that contains chamomile, in just about any grocery store. You can even fill a bottle or thermos cup with it and sip it while you do your speech, instead of plain water. I like it best hot but it's also quite palatable when cooled down. Chamomile has almost no flavor at all, but it smells a little like wildflowers. Looks kind of like pale iced tea in color.<br>  <br>  Now, an herbal calmant in the proper dosage is not going to work the same as a tranquilizer, and that is intentional. It should have a gentler effect. But trust me, you don't WANT to feel "tranquilized" when you're doing a speech - because if you're TOO calm, you lose the energy that will help you make it work. Nervousness is just misplaced energy, and if you dampen down all your energy, you lose the opportunity to channel it and use it to help you connect with your audience. A little nervousness is a good thing. It keeps you a little excited, a little on the edge, sensitive to the momentum of the situation. It's only if the nervousness is out of control that you want to try and tamp it down a little.<br>  <br>  Above all, try just remembering that there's really nothing to be that nervous about. The worst that can happen probably won't happen, and it would probably be survivable even if it did! Remember to breathe - that helps. I suggest that when you practice your speech, always begin this way: shut your eyes, take three deep breaths, open your eyes, and begin. If you always do it that way when you practice, then when you stand up to do it for real, that action will help to bring you into a calm, familiar mental space, as if it was just one more rehearsal. <br>  <br>  Some of us actually find public speaking to be lots of fun, and we enjoy the energy rush that comes along with the nervousness. So the most important thing to do is to approach it as if it could be fun, not a form of torture. Whichever one you decide it is - torture or fun - you can turn it into just that. So don't dwell on the fears; just plan to enjoy your "15 minutes of fame". :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Zg4Wfjnnaa	valium!!!
iK3YYRaTaa	How are insulin resistance and pre-diabetes diagnosed?<br>  Health care providers use blood tests to determine whether a person has pre-diabetes but do not usually test for insulin resistance. Insulin resistance can be assessed by measuring the level of insulin in the blood. However, the test that most accurately measures insulin resistance, called the euglycemic clamp, is too costly and complicated to be used in most doctors’ offices. The clamp is a research tool used by scientists to learn more about glucose metabolism. If tests indicate pre-diabetes or metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance most likely is present.<br>  <br>  Diabetes and pre-diabetes can be detected with one of the following tests:<br>  <br>  Fasting glucose test. This test measures blood glucose in people who have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours. This test is most reliable when done in the morning. Fasting glucose levels of 100 to 125 mg/dL are above normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. This condition is called pre-diabetes or IFG. People with IFG often have had insulin resistance for some time. They are much more likely to develop diabetes than people with normal blood glucose levels.<br>  <br>  Glucose tolerance test. This test measures blood glucose after people fast for at least 8 hours and 2 hours after they drink a sweet liquid provided by a doctor or laboratory. A blood glucose level between 140 and 199 mg/dL means glucose tolerance is not normal but is not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. This form of pre-diabetes is called IGT and, like IFG, it points toward a history of insulin resistance and a risk for developing diabetes.<br>  <br>  People whose test results indicate they have pre-diabetes should have their blood glucose levels checked again in 1 to 2 years.<br>  <br>  So to finish the answer , yes a blood test.|`|pRF5LLloaa	To test for Insulin Resistence, The doctor ALSO needs to perform a Blood Insulin Level Test. [No -- saliva or urine is NOT possible]<br>  <br>  If the Blood Glucose test is HIGH but the Insulin Level Test is LOW then your pancreas is failing.  if the Blood Glucose is high but the Insulin Level Test is mormal-to-high, then you are insulin resistent.<br>  <br>  Many doctors just "blow off" the Insulin Level Test, and start you on medications for insulin resistance for a short time.  If that works then you ARE insulin resistent, and no further tests are needed.  This apporach has the added advanatage that your treatment starts immediately, without waitng for the test results to return.  This is an important concept in any treatment of diabetes. -- regardless of the cause, start agressive treatment NOW!<br>  <br>  <br>  [BTW: It is a Glucose TOLERANCE Test, not INTOLERANCE test  :-) ]

This will help your body to adjust to your new routine and prevent injuries(remember not to over do any exercise as an injury will put you out of action for any period from 2 days to a couple of months)Keep you time limit to 30 minutes for the first month and then gradually increase it.

At the point of an orgasm your body is overwhelmed maybe causing a little "stiffness" in your body.<br>  <br>  It is normal to feel this way, and some people are addicted to this feeling.

aHPDAqw0aa	Well it would really depend on how your parents felt about it but have you thought about home schooling?...I used to get horrible migraines and they would come in giant chains so if I had one, I had two or three more in a row. I missed so much school that by the middle of the year I had only one day left before they would hold me back a year. My dad decided that I could do homeschooling but after about three months I decided it wasn't for me anymore and I went to get my GED (I had been a really good student and was always in advanced classes so I was a bit ahead of the curve anyways). Right after that I started college when I was 16 while all of my friends (some who are way smarter than I am) were still in high school. I am now 18 and a junior in college with a 3.78 GPA and I am doing equally as well as all of my friends who finished high school (it really doesn't effect you that much anyways because a lot of what you learn in high school is either a repeat of all you learned in elementary-junior high and it is just prep for college anyways). I think it was a great decision for me because I will earn my degree a lot faster than any of my friends will and it looks really good on a resume when you can say that you started college young and did well at it. It may not be the right decision for you but it is worth considering because it will pay off in so many ways.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	I have the same problem.  You can always go on birth control to lessen your periods, but if you don't want to go that route, I recommend Advil or Midol.  And you have to get ahead of your period with it.  Start taking it AS SOON as you feel cramps!  And then every 4-6 hours thereafter.  <br>  <br>  It really helps me, but you have to keep on it.  I notice my cramps getting worse as soon as 4 or so hours have elapsed, and I have to take more meds.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I absolutely feel your pain.|`|KfBk9UMraa	If you are a regular or just about to that point, then maybe take tylenol or whatever you use to relieve cramps. I know people that do that and they said that it works cause' the pain isn't as bad.

Its the most reliable way to go!! Just think NO MORE CRAMPS = WONDERFUL!!!|`|u9QV92KQaa	idk

You girls all want to grow up so fast and as soon as you show signs of maturity, "Pubic Hair," You feel the need to shave it off and look like a 10yo again. The only other reason are, "All my friends are doing it." Don't be a lemming, the only other reason is some guy  asked you to. Well if that's the case, ask yourself, why does he  want me top look like a 10 year old.<br>  You are becoming woman, pubic hair is a part of that.

I just go up and your first few times will probably hurt and once your hair is growing back, it will probably itch a lot but your body gets use to it and i never itch anymore. maybe you can use nair, i never tried it because the smell makes me want to puke. and as to the comment of looking like a 4 year old- thats untrue. you look so sexy with no dirty hair down there and being able to wear sexy things w/o worrying about a few hairs stickin out... yuck!<br>  <br>  btw, if you do try shaving upward- wait a few days before you do it again. it will start growing back the next day (and this is when it might start itching for you) but once you hit the third day, you can go at it again.|`|yQDxgLBPaa	Wow alot of these answers are pretty dumb. But yes you can shave and like another answer do NOT use nair it will burn and you will scream. When I use nair on my eye brows it burns it is so strong can you imagine down there? Yeah not a good idea I shave down there my boyfriend hates it if I don't. Use a new razor and soap or shaving cream and just be careful. I suggest trimming it short first then shaving it. Yes it will be itchy if you let it grow back all crazy. If you shave it at least twice a week you'll be good. I've never got any kind of razor burn the only way that is, if you use a dull razor.

Just stick to the bikini line.|`|p4jSfeqqaa	The first few times you do it, I guarantee it will itch and you will get ingrown hairs. After you do it for awhile though chances are you will have fewer problems. Always use a new razor, and I wouldn't recommend a cheap one either. Try and use a sensitive skin shaving cream. One downside to shaving is hair grows back fast and it requires upkeep. Waxing is a better alternative and costs around $40-50 dollars most places. Good luck.|`|JghXh9dQaa	OMG...

WXExyAlWaa	Unfortunately your mother is probably not thinking rationally about the situation. Sitting her down and telling her how it affects you might not help very much. I would probably advise actually going in to talk to her doctor yourself - yes, it will upset her if/when she finds out, but you are in a very difficult situation here. You're too young to have this kind of responsibility for your own mother.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if you know how many different medications she's tried, but if you feel she's actually a danger to herself there might be more that you and the doctor can do. The doctor is probably the one with the most reasonable answers here, though, and your only real choices are to move out and give up on your mother or to ignore her wishes and try to do what's best for her.|`|1envyw1iaa	Next tim e she is stable have her write down the signs of her depression and mania.

A certain level of stress is unavoidable, in modern society, so it is a good idea to develop effective coping methods. Light to moderate daily exercise helps fight stress. For some people, it helps to visualise a quiet, relaxing scene (imagine, as vividly as you can, that you are on a tropical beach, reclining comfortably; you luxuriate, as the the sun warms you, and a gentle breeze caresses your skin lightly, inhaling the tangy, sea scented, salt laden spray from the sparkling, translucent, aqua waves, crashing on the white, coral beach sand, and feeling the hot sand slip through your fingers in one hand, sipping your favorite drink with the other; all the while, the seagulls call, swoop and cavort playfully overhead in a cloudless, azure sky: you feel just like one of them, free to soar and cartwheel, or just glide in the moist, heavy air, and that this moment will last forever ... ). <br>  <br>  Options: Try: <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat..." rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/meditat...</a>  & <a href="http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio.asp?f=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthjourneys.com/free_audio...</a> & <a href="http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditation-content/" rel="nofollow">http://www.meditainment.com/free-meditat...</a> & <a href="http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hypnosistreatment.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.freehypnosistreatment.com/hyp...</a>  Relaxation Hypnosis  & www.meditainment.com/stress-buster/ Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. The supplement DHEA is thought to counter the stress hormone, Cortisol. Ginseng & Lady's Slipper are recommended herbal remedies: see section 55, at ezy build, below. Practise daily, one of the relaxation techniques in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i; whichever works best for you, but the mindfulness breathing for 15 - 20 mns is ideal, although the progressive muscle relaxation can be learned quickly, and takes only several minutes, if pressed for time.

Employ the EFT version for use in public, for which you can reasonably claim that you have a headache, as you massage/tap your temples, but it may be advisable to restrict yourself to subvocalising (saying it to yourself, in your mind, not aloud). Section 53, and pages 2, 2.q and 2.o refer. "Even though I sometimes suffer from stress, I deeply and completely accept myself". A variant of EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy, which has been used successfully for those people suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, insomnia, and anxiety, is shown in section 42, on page i, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> (also see sections 19, 48, & 4). I have found that the 2 - 3 minutes spent using the EMDR markedly reduces distractions to the relaxation process, and is well worthwhile. You can also multitask, using the gazing technique, as you walk/jog or exercise, by focusing on a distant object, or just focus awareness on how each step feels, noting any thoughts which flash across your mind, without pursuing any particular train of thought, just gently redirect your focus to the task at hand.|`|xywgBurHaa	I've been through the Mill as they say.<br>  It's sometimes hard to chill.<br>  Close your eyes & breath deeply.<br>  Any stress ??

Also, for your meals do not eat anything extra or more than what you need. A healthy amount of times to eat per day is 5. 3 meals and two snacks, one in the morning, one in the afternoon.

Those stages are:<br>  <br>  Denial: The initial stage: "It can't be happening." <br>  Anger: "Why ME? It's not fair?!" (either referring to God, oneself, or anybody perceived, rightly or wrongly, as "responsible") <br>  Bargaining: "Just let me live to see my son graduate." <br>  Depression: "I'm so sad, why bother with anything?" <br>  Acceptance: "It's going to be alright.<br>  Growth: Grief is a chance for personal growth. For many people, it may eventually lead to renewed energy to invest in new activities and new relationships. Some people seek meaning in their loss and get involved in causes or projects that help others. Some people find a new compassion in themselves as a result of the pain they have suffered. They may become more sensitive to others, thus enabling richer relationships. Others find new strength and independence they never knew they had. After the loss, they find new emotional resources that had not been apparent before. Kübler-Ross originally applied these stages to any form of catastrophic personal loss (job, income, freedom). This also includes the death of a loved one and divorce.<br>  <br>   Kübler-Ross also claimed these steps do not necessarily come in order, nor are they all experienced by all patients, though she stated a person will always experience at least two.See www.amazon.com/ for books on the various stages. After a while, consider making a photoalbum/scrapbook and/or a shrine, in remembrance, and set aside; say; one day every month, perhaps on a significant date, (for example; the 17th, or the second thursday) on which to reflect. Many religious organisations offer counselling, or you may feel more comfortable with a therapist, to express your thoughts, and feelings. Journalling may help in this. Celebrate that life; be thankful for the experience, and remember the good times.

Most of your situation has to do with grief over him. It's perfectly normal to go on for maybe a week or two and you'll realize that it'll be okay. He was probably extremely lucky to have you! In the mean time, try to focus on things that make you happy. like friends, family fun, and just having good times. Make a scapbook of all the great times you have had with your grandpa and look at it when you're feeling down. Another part of your situation could be from school or if you have gotten in a fight with a family memeber or friend. This is also normal and what helps could be talking to a parent about it, asking a close friend or relative for help and just shaking the stress and sadness off by doing things you like and giving yourself reminders that you'll be ok and you grandpa had a great life and was very lucky to have you as a granddaughter! I hope this helps you alot! Again i'm sorry for your loss and i hope you feel better!! :)|`|TR95nukuaa	You're grieving for your grandpa. It's expected. Everyone deals with grief in different ways. Try spending some time with your family remembering nice things about your grandpa.<br>  <br>  Death isn't easy on anyone, but unfortunately everyone experiences it.<br>  <br>  In time things will start to get better.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss.

8H9JHVZeaa	did you try flossing?.....  If there is redness or swelling and bleeding it is definately sign of inflammation.  make sure you floss and brush in the next days and inflammation should go away.  If you feel there is definately something going on you can also rinse with salt and water.  I dont think you should be getting yourself stressed too much, it is probably due to plaque accumulation/bacteria-probably your oral hygiene was not at its best during your vacation, and you dont need too much for your gums to bleed or become inflammed.  So good luck
WXExyAlWaa	You may not feel like it, but your family would be devastated if you died. It's likely that with your friend's death so recent everyone's feelings are mixed up and confused. It would be good to find someone to talk to, a counselor or therapist, to discuss your guilt and shame and depression with. Grief counselors have seen very many different situations and might be able to help you through this to a place where things look okay again. It sounds practically impossible, I know, but it's worth a try, isn't it?|`|ParFJxnSaa	See the advice, and weblinks/hotlines regarding suicidal thoughts/ideation, in section 5, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> and contact them, as needed. <br>  Often, such feelings result from depression, or at least this has been my own personal experience, and when you find effective treatment for this disorder, thoughts of suicide diminish, and eventually disappear.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you view section 2, on depression (page R first) at ezy build, and seek treatment, including counselling ASAP: whether this involves medication or not. Antidepressants can start becoming effective in 2 - 4 weeks, but if you decide to accept the risks and side effects, check them out first at <a href="http://www.drugs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugs.com</a> & <a href="http://www.rxlist.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com</a> and read the labels, and/or inserts with the medication. Only you really know the true extent of your depression, and whether you have actually made any viable plans. Be on the lookout for any worsening of your situation, immediately following antidepressant use, as advised in the literature.<br>   Some people in the mental health field believe that, although a severely depressed person may feel suicidal, they have neither the energy, nor the planning ability to organise such an attempt. There may be a "window of opportunity", in the first couple of weeks, following antidepressant use, when the antidepressant effect has not yet begun to reach effective levels, but energy levels, and planning abilities are beginning to be restored, and it is in this time frame, particularly with young people, when the likelihood of a suicide attempt is at its highest. <br>  <br>  Also, I am informed that most doctors tend to prescribe on the conservative side. Some people require as much as 30 times the dose of a particular medication, for it to be effective, (it shouldn't be anywhere near that margin, with antidepressants) so they tend to initially prescribe on the low side. The patient may return, saying that they were ineffective, and want to try something else, with similar results, or may seek a second opinion. So, if you begin with an antidepressant, and find it ineffective, ask whether the dosage can be increased. <br>  <br>  Realise that it can take several weeks to begin reaching peak effectiveness; that, once commenced, antidepressants should be continued for at least 9 months, (since the average length of a depressive episode is 6 months) although a maximum of 18 months is recommended. After that time, they should be weaned off, with medical advice as to how long, to minimise withdrawal symptoms, and the situation closely monitored. Depression recurs in around 50% of cases, so be on the alert for the signs, and take early action. Neither antidepressants, nor St. John's wort should be relied on as a sole treatment for depression, but used in addition to the core treatments shown on page R, above.|`|hV6UhcpSaa	SEEK HELP IMMEDIATELY! your life is worth living, believe it.  you have self worth please believe it.  i beg of you please seek help you need to keep your life people WILL miss you.|`|ikm8hJYZaa	They will never realize if you do not speak about it.<br>  <br>  Tell them.It will help release your pain.|`|D3fsk3SCaa	If you have friends why would they be better off without you?<br>  If they didn't want you around then they wouldn't be your friends.<br>  You answered your own question. Your friends are against it. They obviously care for you and don't want you harming yourself.<br>  You've had two boyfriends (and hopefully this doesn't come out as mean, but it's what I believe) and you loved both of them so they were nothing more, really, than just really amazing friends (with benefits lol) and you'll eventually meet someone who really really makes you happy, but you have to cheer up first. <br>  Rather than hating yourself and feeling guilty for your dear friends death I'd be hating the person who told him that and led him to commit suicide. Yeah, hates a bad thing, but I think it's better to hate someone else then to hate yourself. (People are probably like I give horrible advice but hey, it's true). <br>  Is your friend a christian? If not then he doesn't believe in an afterlife therefore he would've never been with you in the first place. He also was probably already majorly depressed, which wasn't your fault, which is what actually led to his suicide not you, so don't blame yourself. <br>  Don't wait for your parents to talk to you. Talk to your parents. They probably don't want to upset you so they're avoiding conversation. Maybe they want you to give the first word. <br>  Also, if you're hiding behind a smile and they don't realise who would they know you were moping (You kind of contradicted yourself there) <br>  <br>  I know, I would respect my friend a lot more if she came out and told me she was depressed and suicidal then having to find out after you commited suicide. <br>  <br>  There are actual people in the world right now at this very moment with noone at all, but they aren't commiting suicide. You have people, you said it yourself. You have friends and they obviously love you enough to be there for you so go tell them now!|`|jQz5vABzaa	Trust me, one passes through downs and extreme downs but for ou to ask here displays courage.<br>  I don't know you and i already care so much that I dont want to see you get hurt!

But your friends are FRIENDS and they are there for you. So you should be honest with them and talk to them about it. Get your feelings out because your mental/emotional/physical health is very important. Even if they are against it, they'll listen and try to help you out. It'll feel much better if you tell someone about how you've been feeling. Good luck. *hug*<br>  <br>  Also, you have NO reason to feel guilty. YOU did nothing. So let go of it, sweetie. <3 It'll be okay.
GgClh7dbaa	She probably has diabetic ketoacidosis and is breathing rapidly to blow off carbon dioxide in an attempt to raise the blood pH. The hormone would be insulin in such a case<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure that you've left out some of the information given with this problem. I'm assuming that you have been told that Mary is diabetic, probably Type I diabetes, which is insulin deficiency. One of the metabolic consequences of insulin deficiency beside excess glucose in the blood (hyperglycemia) is the accumulation of ketones, a condition called ketosis, which makes the blood acidic, a condition called acidemia. Acidosis is the state of having too much acid in the body, whereas acidemia refers only to the blood being acidic.<br>  <br>  When acidosis is due to the addition of an acid to the body, it is called metabolic acidosis. The pH falls below the normal 7.40 The body compensates by hyperventilating, which creates what is called a compensatory respiratory alkalosis and helps bring the pH back up toward 7.4|`|SZgOodf1aa	What it sounds like you are describing is a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.  Basically, this is a condition that occurs in diabetics (usually type 1 diabetes, but it can also occasionally happen in type 2 diabetes).  Basically, this occurs when there is an inuslin deficiency in the body (i.e. the person forgot to administer their insulin dose, or they are a new onset diabetic and were unaware of the disease).  Anyway, without insulin, glucose cannot enter cells and remains in the bloodstream.  Since the cells cannot get glucose, they begin breaking down fatty acids as an alternative fuel source, which results in the development of "ketone bodies" or ketoacids.  These compounds are acidic, causing the pH within the person's body to fall.  The body tries to compensate for this by blowing off carbon dioxide from the respiratory tract, which is why such a person breaths very rapidly in a sort of sighing manner (they call this Kussmaul respirations).  In the question, "Mary" needs to be given the hormone insulin (in addition to some other interventions to stabilize her blood pH, etc).  But, she needs insulin to correct the DKA.  If it is left untreated, and her blood pH continues falling, the result will be coma, cardiac arrest and death.
AA10284965	The best things you can do are:<br>  Keep those areas clean. DO NOT SCRUB, this will make the acne worse, as it will irritate it.<br>  Drink lots of water<br>  Get an acne spot treatment.

It travels into the blood stream so quickly that trying to suck it out won't help and could introduce infection. The best thing to do if someone gets bitten by a venomous snake is to call 911, keep them calm and treat them for shock if necessary, make sure the victim can breath. Be sure to note the breed of snake and the time the bite occured. I could be wrong but I think you are supposed to elevate the biten area if possible. make sure 911 knows the person was biten by a snake so that antivenom can be prepared at the ER and ready to go.

e8FiZHkRaa	I began running on the treadmill this time last year and I lost 28lbs. 45mins will be OK to start with but once you get better you should be aiming for an hour. Gradually build up your speed, don't give up, and thr weight will start to drop off. Right now, I cover 7.5miles in my hour. At first you may only be able to cover  5 but it just gives you an idea of how much you can improve. I find it usually says around 100kcals every 10mins for me but obviously that'll vary on the size you're at now (the heavier you are, the more calories you burn) and the speed that you're running at. So if you were going for 45mins, round about 450kcals. It's easy to say "I'll do 45mins" but you probably won't be able to do that much to begin with. Don't get disheartened though, just keep on using the treadmill, walk/run if you like and you'll get better.<br>  <br>  If you see a trainer in the gym, some of them specialise in "special populations". They can guide people who have specific requirements like yourself, and give you muscle workouts to suit your body. It may be worth looking into it so they can give you some fun and exciting things to do.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  x|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Same as running, more effective yet harder if put on an incline.|`|174ecf3bb83bf13823e446b49ed3fa4daa	I've been doing a "treadmill" workout now for about 2 months and have lost 10 lbs. I walk/run for every other "lap" around the track for 30 minutes. My average caloric burn is 275. I'm also doing the Slim-Fast diet. A shake in the morning, a shake at lunch, plus 200 calories of healthy foods. I have a rice cake (chocolate flavor, yum!) = 60 calories and Yoplait whipped strawberry = 140 calories. Then a delicious dinner! It seems to be working well for me. Oh, and if you can, get the Slim-Fast powdered shake mix you mix with milk, waaaay better than the canned stuff. Good Luck!|`|4b8MLoJNaa	I have seen studies that found that running "X" number of kilometers or miles on the treadmill burns about 10% less calories than "X" number of kilometers or miles on the ground, while walking/running at the same intensity. That is the key though, intensity. You need to get your heart rate up into that 75%-85% of max heartrate zone whether you are on the treadmill or on the street. And you need to keep it there for 20-30 minutes. This will kickstart your metabolism and keep it going even after you get off the treadmill. You definitely need to work some bodyweight resistance exercises like push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, squats and lunges into your routine too though. It is very important to build muscle and to keep yourself interested and challenged.|`|dKi2R2oHaa	I recommend that you forget the treadmill and do some weights instead.  You can get some nice spinlock dumbells from Argos for under ￡30. <br>  <br>  Doing weights will be more interesting, cheaper and give you better fitness.
y4SUDnpaaa	It's probably a habit you picked up when you were very young and you've grown so accustomed to it you don't even realize you're doing it. Ask your Nana and your friends to tell you when they notice you doing it. If you start to become aware of it, you may be able to stop. If you don't stop it's no big deal, lots of people have little quirks they are unaware of.|`|wNtBzGGYaa	theres nothing wrong with you. A girl in my class does that to......it looks really stupid so try to stop haha. well good luck?|`|ANsznbWsaa	I do it too.

yCUOXInFaa	No this not normal behaviour to have sexual feelings for animals. Definately seek medical attention.|`|RIZpDdNgaa	Okay, well I would not consider this to be normal.  Do you get pleasure out of seeing animals have sex?  Maybe it is just pleasant to you, I'm not really sure of the psychology behind this, but i wouldn't think this was normal you should get help.<br>  And you can control yourself, you aren't gonna rape your dog.|`|ZX1nU9Vzaa	You will have a hard time finding anyone who could help you with this.  What you have is a psychosexual mental disorder called a 'paraphilia'.  There may be a psychologist who could help you somewhere, but good luck finding one.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to pray for help.  Pray for help to stop lusting and to stop masturbating.  Lust and masturbation are serious sins.  In Biblical times, Israelites who committed acts of bestiality were put to death.|`|0jwXQPCoaa	The Bible provides the answers of how to live and how to think. By following God's rules, everything in life becomes easier.<br>  <br>  Bestiality is a sin. Masturbation, in and of itself, is NOT a sin.<br>  <br>  Instead of going to a psychologist, I'd start reading a bible. You'll solve your problem and not waste years of your life on therapy.|`|ikm8hJYZaa	No this is not normal behavior.<br>  <br>  You should visit a psychologist asap.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	LOL|`|354ee70c2c4423a17f2d4f038d00cafbaa	This is a double sided sword... For those of you that think it's wrong let's just stop and think about this:<br>  <br>  Everyone gets off differently than the next person. Not every person is going to have the same sexual desires as anyone else. No one is the same! She may be genuinely turned on by animals, and if it's what she gets off to, it's what she gets off to. No one has the right to throw her to a therapist if that's what stimulates her.<br>  <br>  Now, you've been doing this for a while and now that you have a live animal in the home you're attracted to it and love it (depending on the definition) that's just fine. If you're coming to fear the animal in belief that you'll succumb to your sexual desires and possibly harm the animal I would suggest that you at least talk to a professional. The fact that you're still attracted to humans but have a unique sexual stimulus towards animals suggests possible confusion, that's just my opinion dear.<br>  <br>  No one has the right to look down on her or laugh at her for that. Keep that in mind the next time someone opens the door for help and you brutally throw rocks inside of a very small 4x4 room.|`|BnjMdTwUaa	If you masturbate to animals, you have zoophilia and it's not THAT uncommon.<br>  <br>  It is a strange fetish as you well know and I have one, also.  I have Coprophilia.<br>  <br>  You could seek a psychologist if you will, or you could satisfy your fetish.  Pick one.|`|31Y7QUmkaa	you definitely need a psychiatrist because it is not normal to be sexually attracted to an animal. I'm sure you won't rape your dog. This is not normal, seriously seek help. <br>  <br>  and people who are laughing or making fun just shut up!|`|OPcaJwiuaa	OK, u just feel a strong , friendly connection wit animals, and alot of ppl masturbate u no, its totally normal. So ur fine, u wont rap3 ur dog.|`|Xmxaxi5Gaa	HAHAHA THIS IS SO BIZZARE|`|hV6UhcpSaa	i saw a youtube video on this disorder.  your not alone BUT its definitely not normal get help. its an animal....|`|TIZlphrlaa	...|`|8KFpNE3Kaa	umm... wow! it could be worse, I knew a guy who would steal a womens shoe after having sex with her, go home and shove it up his @ss, but yeah get help
WQ3uCllqaa	Sounds like virtual braces...like on the internet. I had braces and it hurts for the first few weeks and then for a few days after they adjust them. I had to take Tylenol all the time. But it was so worth it cuz my teeth are beautiful now! Let me see what these iBraces are now...<br>  <br>  Interesting. They may look like they's be uncomfortable but you'd be surprised what your mouth and tongue gets used to over time. Maybe the tongue gets calluses on them much the way the sides of your mouth do with regular braces to protect from scratching. I had an expander which goes in the roof of your mouth and at first it was very uncomfortable and awkward and it made me talk like a handicapped person. But I got used to it and it worked out. <br>  <br>  These are a good idea because they accomplish the same thing and no one has to see them. I wish I had gotten those. Cool beans. I say go for it!|`|c3Cy3tdKaa	I think you should just get regular ones because they look like they would cut your toungue.|`|jIeupHgJaa	Isn't that the same thing as lingual braces?<br>  Or is that just another name for them?|`|2R9IrRfCaa	It might make you talk weird.|`|TgIMUmZPaa	iBraces look cool. They take a while to get used to (talking, eating, etc.).<br>  <br>  They are expensive though.|`|R2YjrRbYaa	Looks like it would hurt... and be very uncomfortabel

XsqlvtI9aa	Stop for a second.  I'm telling you this, and I know what I'm talking about.<br>  People who think that losing weight alone is healthy are WRONG on so many levels! When you decide to lose weight, <br>  <br>  you should lose the extra pounds safely and in a healthy way. You don't want to end up with anorexia, bulimia, or any <br>  <br>  other eating disorders because inorganic supplements disrupted your body's normal processes instead of helping it get <br>  <br>  back on the healthy track.<br>  <br>  The Acai Berry weight loss pill helps you avoid that because it's both safe and organic. Not only is this product <br>  <br>  popular with mothers who choose organic supplements for their family but is also greatly popular with international <br>  <br>  celebrities and the Brazilian people. It is also an easy way to give your children the daily nutrients they need.<br>  Now I'm not just saying this.<br>  The Acai berry is bursting with vital nutrients. It's consisted of 52.2 grams of carbohydrates, 8.1 grams of protein, <br>  <br>  and 44.2 grams of fiber forms for every 100 grams of the fruit's extract. It also has the highest antioxidant matter <br>  <br>  among organic and inorganic fruits alike.<br>  <br>  Best of all, it helps your body burn fat properly by speeding up your metabolism and improving your digestion and not <br>  <br>  by forcing your body to flush out whatever food you eat.<br>  <br>  So stop just thinking about it and take some massive action by ordering a free trial here: <a href="http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/" rel="nofollow">http://acaiberryselectformula.tk/</a>|`|d7qhitG4aa	break up with me.<br>  <br>  i have found it has apparently helped many girls lose weight.|`|eXsaXt5qaa	-Control your calorie intake to 1500 a day or even 1400 these little things go a long way.  <br>  -Also dont drink soda or diet soda, even though its diet its still bad for you.  <br>  -Lastly have a a bunch of small meals a day not three big ones. <br>  -Oh yeah and to give your diet an extra boost try working out in any way for 30 minutes a day.<br>  GOOD LUCK :]|`|03g0WSvZaa	try the Baby Jack workout <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a> it is fun and it works

GBG2hbQ4aa	No, you aren't crazy. It is common (when you are young) to become fixated with death....it's an unknown, and a scary one at that.  So your mind plays with all the different ideas related to death.  It's exploring all the possibilities.  Somewhere along the way, the frequency of thinking about death should subside. <br>  <br>  Still, it is a good idea to talk with your parents or a school counselor.  Part of the [learning] process we call life includes coming to terms with our own mortality (the fact that we will die someday).  It is easier to navigate this process with someone who can guide you and keep you from becoming overly anxious about your own thoughts and ideas.|`|Xmxaxi5Gaa	what do you mean help i do this all the time|`|31Y7QUmkaa	i would talk to a counselor. its really not good to think about death like that whether youre depressed or not. really my mom worked with people when she was a social worker and she said that people would often think about their death if <br>  a) they misuse medication<br>  b) they have a mental disorder (depression is one)<br>  c) they lack emotional fulfillment<br>  casually bring it up like its no big deal and maybe you can see a therapist.

qiYjhM4Gaa	its called a sty, i actually am getting over one now. it's not a big deal health wise, although it can be REALLY irritating. basically, a duct in your eye line got a lot of build up in it (from dirt, makeup, etc) so now it's infected. if you can stand the pain to pop it, go ahead, but sometime that can make it worse. all i did was just leave it alone, it'll be gone (the irritation) within a week and after that, it'll slowly just disappear. good luck tho!|`|llxqG6Otaa	Ok it's quiet possible that it is a white head (which is like a hardened pimple puss collects under it and it cannot be popped) or it is a STY which is more like a wart. You definatly don't want to POP it, or mess with it, you can infect it and make it bigger or worse. A visit to your regular dr, or clinic, or even a dermatologist would be the best answer. Because it is close to your eye don't wait, have it looked at. You cannot get STD's with out having sex, so who ever told you that it's herpes of the eye is ridiculous. Don't worry, just have it looked at.|`|FOWKU8iCaa	im not sure what it is called but its some type of parasite that needs to get removed by surgery my uncle had one and the surgery was easy and fast if Im wrong sorry 2 scare you matter of fact just go see your doctor hope all goes well ")|`|7niAbH6gaa	awww seriously good luck!!i have one right now and it hurts soooooo baddly!!i was looking for treatments when is utbled on to ur question<br>  whatever u do to make it feel better,do tell me!!cuz i have one whihc is hurting tooo much!!

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|zkovxRseaa	eat donuts every hour, 3 at a time|`|51jR2Lmlaa	Eat healthy food. Do cardio. I left my answer vague on purpose. Follow these rules and you'll lost weight. Obviously the healthier you eat and the more you exercise, the better the results. End of story.|`|AA12114705	Cut down on carbs and sugars and fats. Try not to eat a lot of snack junk food through out the day, but replace those snacks with fruit or a veggies with a fat free dip. Eat frequent small healthy meals, not 3 big ones. Eat breakfast, protein is good for you especially in the mornings. I like using the treadmill personally, but the bike and stair climbers are good. Maybe you could find a cardio class or something fun like kickboxing. Try to make your workouts interesting, if they aren't you'll get bored and be more likely to quit. Once you do start losing weight, be sure you know what your weight goal is. You want to keep some muscle on you, so being a tiny little twig isn't a great idea.<br>  <br>  My favorite all time exercise is lap swimming; I love the water!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
UL3XOKJxaa	No sharp objects...Prozac!
r7OfoWbnaa	Good for you, questioning the opinion of your doctor! Your doctor got it only half right. Yes, the rule of thumb is to try for at least 12 months to conceive before seeking professional help UNLESS there is a reason to believe that there is a problem. Switch to a better OB/Gyn and ask for a HSG (Hysterosalpingogram). This is a test where a dye is injected into the tubes to see if there is anything wrong with them. This is the only non-surgical technique, which allows insight into tubal patency. If questions of tubal patency are associated with other medical conditions your doctor might recommend a laparoscopy or hysteroscopy to gain more information. Best of luck to you!|`|muHctmaGaa	I am very sorry you had to experience a miscarriage.

Birth control pill prevents the ovaries from releasing an egg for the sperm to fertilise. The pain could be from adhesions on the ovary.|`|5KndPRJfaa	Birth control pills are really only a short term solution to ovarian cysts. Often they will get rid of the cyst or at least reduce it, but only temporarily - it will come back.<br>  <br>  Conventional medical approaches to ovarian cysts are very limited, and treat the symptoms rather than the underlying root cause. Have you considered the natural approach? If you take a holistic approach to treating what really is a profound internal, metabolic and hormonal problem, you are much more likely to get results.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in getting more information, I found a good website at <a href="http://www.OvarianCystsHealed.info." rel="nofollow">http://www.OvarianCystsHealed.info.</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.

You should watch what you eat and exercise for the health benefits. I know that at your age you feel like you need to be tiny, but that's not healthy at all. Look at toning your muscles with things like squats, lunges, crunches, and push ups. you can do these any where. and add in cardio like the dude said, if your breathing hard its cardio, I recommend an 1/2 brisk walk, daily. Too intense cario can burn muscle. Watch white carbs, like bread, rice, etc and sugar and saturated fat. Eat good lean protein like fish and chicken, after strength exercises to promote healthy muscle rehabilitation. And remember you should give your self a day to eat whatever you want and rest.

AA10551261	Body aches are a side effect of the immune system response to an invading pathogen or germ. When your immune system detects the presence of these foreign objects, it uses certain proteins and chemicals (called cytokines) to communicate with the rest of the body. Some of these cytokines (like interleukins) can cause such things as fever and body aches, because they trigger these specific reactions.

vwtVRW11aa	Oh it is normal. I had it before. Don't worry the doctor won't remove your tonsils. The white patches are just a normal way of tonsillitis. Be sure to ask you doctor to give you some antibiotic medicine or something else that you feel comfortable with. If you hate taking pills or tablets just tell your doctor! There is always a way to heal your virus without these medications. Ask for some syrup that would help your tonsils heal. However there is a good method without medicine. You could gargle with warm salt water every before bedtime so additional bacteria would stay away. Do that and the bacterias that are going to infect your tonsils more will avoid your tonsils. You will need a lot of extra sleep and you need to drink warm water a lot. I recommend at lest like 6-8 glasses of warm water a day! If you don't want to go to the doctor and no medication you would have to still gargle with warm salty water and you have to wait at least 2 weeks for the swelling to go down.<br>  <br>  Hoped I help!<br>  <br>  Edit: Don't do any drinking it would just infect your tonsils more.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh yeah if you are allergic to PENICILLIN do not buy antibiotics tablets ask your doctor if there is something else.I am not allergic to penicillin so I don't know anything without Penicillin.|`|Ss6MeyDYaa	ring NHS direct, they will be able to help you and are available 24 hrs a day|`|6E7VGyNgaa	white spots on the tonsil are tonsilitis. only way to cure it is gargle warm salt water and get amoxicillin from doctor.|`|91b447d14a20a5eb99e6371357163e4faa	Like Natalie says, it does sound like tonsilitis and the advice to gargle with warm salt water is good. be careful with requesting amoxycillin though as a lot of people are allergic to it (Penicillin). If you feel ok generally, there is no need to stay away from college, especially with exams coming up. Just don't do any drinking at the college disco if you are on antibiotics and try not to kiss to many people. A good antibacterial mouthwash may also help.

D100ixUgaa	The right weight depends entirely on how strong you are and what exercise you're doing. 8 pounds might be the right weight for bicep curls, but it's probably way too low for chest press. On your first set, lift a weight that you can feel, but not one that's too challenging. Then up the weight. The second set should be difficult to finish. On the third set, use the same weight, but keep going until you can't lift it any more. If you can do more than 12 reps on the third set, you should use a heavier weight next time.<br>  <br>  Aim for 8-12 reps on all your sets. This whole "high reps is best for women" thing is a myth. You will NOT get huge unless you dedicate your life and your diet to getting huge; women don't build muscle that easily.

IF that is the case go to the ER and let them know what's going on and they will decide if you need to be hospitalized. Not everyone who goes into the ER will be hospitalized but most times they will help set up some kind of therapy for you so that you have on going support and care.
nBKSMnTSaa	Besides the smell and texture of the discharge, are you feeling any itchy, burning, or like you need to go pee but in reality you don't kind of symptoms? If you have these along with the cottage cheese looking discharge, then it most likely means you have a Yeast Infection. A Yeast infection basically means you weren't clean enough down there (it can be gotten through being sexually active or just from stress and being dirty) and so there was an overproduce of fungi causing an infection. This s easily treated, do not go out and get your own medicine for you do not know what you might be allergic to. Go see the doctor and they will prescribe you some medicine, then it'll go away.

ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes of exercise, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly in daytime, outside. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, (a free E course in it is at: <a href="http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome" rel="nofollow">http://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome</a> ) or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	Jim 31115 Amen|`|8LhEs3WLaa	Sorry but you can't. Depression stops us from thinking logically and usually means there is a chemical our body/brain is lacking in. Medication helps replace the chemical and therapy helps our thought processes. A therapist will help you find what is actually causing the depression so that you can deal with it and hopefully over come it. This is a harrowing process but if you put in the hard work now, your issue won't effect you throughout your life as you have dealt with it. Once you  have found the cause of your depression and worked through it your doctor will then hopefully be able to wean you off medication. If you don't find what is causing the depression and work through it, you will suffer for the rest of your life. Do the hard work now and live a life of knowledge and peace.

nnpEcqZdaa	Of course!  Speaking from experience, most of the reason you feel bloated is due to gas from eating too fast.  Do you belch and fart when you work out?  If so, that's part of the reason in the difference of feeling.  The best way to eat is, of course, slowly but more importantly follow this credo: STOP WHEN FULL!  It does wonders for your weight.  Aside from exercise, most weight loss happens not when we replace regular food and drink with diet food and drink but when we stop when we feel satisfied rather than packing it in.  It's no sin to save leftovers or get them to go.   It's a great way to save money too! Also feel free to toss out leftovers if it's not enough for a future meal or just snack on it when you get hungry.

You might as well go with condoms paired with a spermicidal lubricant or contraceptive foam.

Put the condom on your partner yourself, so you can verify there aren't any tears and that it's rolled down completely.|`|0jLj7yJpaa	Well a condom is always the best option! But there are other options available to you. If I'm correct, you don't need to be 18 to buy birth control from a supermarket. You'd be amazed the kind of birth control for women at the supermarket. They have sprays, spermicides, dissolving things like those Listerine Pocketpaks. As long as you use a condom AS well as these forms of birth control, you'll be fine. There is also something called a female condom that is basically like a male condom except it is placed within the woman's vagina. If you do need to be 18 or you aren't comfortable, find a friend who would be willing to help. Also, your aunt would probably not be a bad resource.

I promise.|`|DTiphZNKaa	Okay if you go to the sexual clinic or planned parent hood its completly confidential and if the nurses called your aunt or told anyone that you were there they are risking having there nursing license taken away and being sued.

Probably your boyfriend becuase they will give you guys free condoms most likely and help explain some things that are useful to know for your first time.  If your worried about seeing someone you know there, they probably wont say anything to anyone else becuase they were there right? Which means they dont want people knowing they were there.

CQVzUcw7aa	Your eating fine and healthy. My only concern is if you don't have some source of calcium you'll get very weak bones. If you don't drink milk at least take a supplement pill or drink soy milk, rice milk, or almond milk. And you also should drink water, it's what were made out of, unless you want to get dehydrated and die, that's fine. Water is a good drinking source than anything else (besides milk) because it has no calories, which will help you lose weight.|`|88MByjTxaa	That's actually really UNhealthy because your getting low calories and almost no vitamins since what your eating pretty much gives you iron and fiber. Dont get rid of the milk since cacium helps regulate your metabolism. And low calories and vitamins causes your body to eat MUSCLE not fat. Take vitamins 2 times a day if your going to use that diet but I wouldn't recommend it since you'll need maybe 6 specific vitamins at a time.|`|NwoCBHyMaa	Looks like you are doing alright so far. But what most people don't believe is that you need to throw a healthy snack between meals. it keeps your metabolism going and you'll rarely feel that hungry feeling which leads you to overeat in your meal to come.<br>  <br>  Also it wouldn't hurt to get to the gym a little more regularly. :-)

fk9AvB25aa	You could possibly get an infection but animals carry slightly different strains of stds then humans do making transmission between human and animal not likely to happen.

mjC5XldXaa	That little tube is called a fistula.  I usually acts as a drainage canal for an area of infection.  If it would plug up it could cause your face to swell and alot of pain.  Antibiotics will temporaly take care of the problem, but not eliminate it.  I would go back to the oral surgeon who took it out and ask his opinion.  He was right that usually those root tips will not cause a problem but not so in your case.  He may well have to try to go in and remove the root tip even though there could be a risk of nerve damage.  Sometimes it is a very small risk and other times the risk can be more.  If the nerve is damaged you will have a numb feeling in half of your lower lip.  No paralysis, just a numb or tingling feeling.  If so this usually heals over time.  Ask the dentist.  Also your insurance should cover all costs.  Good luck|`|UL3XOKJxaa	Good answer 'walleye'! I agree 100% Good Day!

771454b5e041b041d8c1257a9a391ad9aa	Yes I think that you should ask your mom about being prescribed birth control for your unexpected and heavy flow periods because you really do seem to need it. I know you said that you're not sexually active but make sure when you ask your mom about it tell her that its only for the purpose of helping you deal with your menstraul periods and its not because you want to have sex or are having sex because you're not, make this clear to her because sometimes parents have their doubts especially considering the fact that you're 16 and its now becoming a normal thing to hear that teens your age are having sex. Also tell her all your other reasons why you would like to be prescribed the birth control pills so that she will understand more and hear you out.<br>  <br>  Also if you don't want to ask your mom, you can go to your doctor or a free clinic and I think they could probably give you the birth control pills free and your mom wouldn't have to know, but I really do think instead of being secretive about it you should ask your mom.<br>  <br>  Personally, I've had the same problem as you I got my period at 13 and its never been regular and I have a heavy flow most of the time and if I skip a month or two, maybe more then when I finally get it during the next month its really really heavy and my cramps almost make me so sick to the point where I'm gonna throw up. Now, I'm 17 and I'm not sexually active either. Lately its been under control so I decided that I didn't need it that much and that I could just deal with it by taking Ibuprofen and since it really isn't affecting me that much right now but my mother does know that when I get my period its really painful for me especially when its unexpected so I just take it so and try to stay calm while doing the normal everyday things in my life.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure your mother will understand because she is a woman and knows that having your peiod isn't something that everyone really looks forward to and she witnesses the pain and discomfort you go through with your unexpected periods so I don't think she would want to keep you suffering like that, just open up to her, don't be afraid to say how you feel.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|sJClbSHGaa	I would. That was one of the reasons my mom actually made me go on birth control. My periods, though not irregular, were heavy and they lasted about eight days and I had horrible cramps. I've been taking YAZ for about two weeks now, and it's supposed to help with all of that. And it helped clear up my acne. :)|`|Tx72PihIaa	yes or you can ask her to take you to the doctors and if they're a lady doctor (not like gyno but if your doctor is an actual female) most likely she will tell you that birth control would be okay for you to take cause it does help with periods. :-) ....You could also go to your health department but they would give you them more on the basis of sex. So just go to your doctor and tell her or wait till you have an appointment and bring it up! Or just tell your mom you heard birth control shortens periods..|`|zWNu03PRaa	Well im not sexually active either. I got birth control because I have severe abdominal cramping causing me to take muscle relaxers and 800 mg of aspirin.<br>  <br>  Just tell her you want it because of your heavy flows and about how your ruining your sheets and underwear---i also had heavy flows and im small so i dont think its because your overweight.--it depends on how heavy your moms or even grandmothers flow is.<br>  <br>  It may come unexpectedly if you change eating habits, do more or less physical activity than before, or if you been stressing around the time you should get your period--probably are other factors but those are three i know can make you late or early.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.
70o2fl5taa	A bra is designed to support your breasts as well as to aid your appearance.  From an appearance perspective the bra, at a minimum, helps to keep your nipples from being obvious and poking through your shirt.  Of course various types are designed to give fullness, shape, cleavage, etc.  It sounds like you are young and don't have a lot of chest to worry about so perhaps your concern is more about the health aspects.  Frankly, if you have very small breasts then there really isn't any physical advantage to wearing a bra.  Big breasted women sometimes suffer from sagging and jiggling and in extreme cases even muscle strain and torn ligaments if they do not wear a bra or wear one with insufficient support.  If you have just little nubs and are concerned about nipple peeking... just put a piece of tape over them and let it all hang out!  Hope this helps.|`|bA4YjF2paa	once your in sixth grade atleast|`|AA11481224	put on a thin top stand before a mirror  are your nipples visible and is the shirt raised at all if yes to both put on a bra<br>  <br>  <br>  sounds like you need one|`|gnhl6hXYaa	hi[:<br>  well hmm... try putting on a thin shirt. if you can see ur "boobs" sorta sticking out (pointy) then yeahh you need a bra<br>  thats not very attractive :P<br>  hope this helped<br>  -andrea<3|`|ORUAtr0kaa	You should start wearing a bra whenever you personally think you need one, or when it starts to be uncomfortable to be without one.|`|v0UuWJSSaa	Take a pencil.<br>  Stick it between your boobs.<br>  Squeeze your boobs together<br>  And if they can hold up the pencil<br>  Then you should wear a bra :)<br>  Easy as that|`|a3bq277Gaa	Whenever you start growing boobs I guess.<br>  Or whenever you're ready to wear one.|`|x7FjDcjzaa	if you have boobs|`|Svo5Kqbyaa	deciding to wear a bra is a personal choice. if you want to wear one, go ahead, if you don't want to then don't! as simple as that. it's up to you. i started wearing a bra when i didn't really have boobs, i just a had little bumps, a.k.a, breast buds. i would suggest that's a good time to start, but when ever you want is fine.|`|SMtmnx6Kaa	i would suggest wearing them if i u had pointy breasts because u dnt want ppl to stare but yet if u dnt then there is no need to wear one. i cant really tell u without actually seeing u. ask ur mom or a close friend. u can trust them to tell u the truth better than an internet stranger. i got my first bra in the 5th grade. it was a sports bra. i didnt have very big boobs at all then. i am now 15 and i still wear 32 A. i mean it just depends. best of luck. :)|`|R0BIzZ13aa	aha wearing a bra is a personal decision.

XkPgw7ZRaa	False, Dear, Sorry I know you did not want to hear this but any exchange of body fluids makes you vulnerable to infection.<br>  <br>  I am not sure what women get from giving guys oral sex anyways.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	False.  Any exchange of body fluids puts you in jeopardy--male or female.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	True. Nowhere in your question does it say a woman is preforming oral sex on a guy who is HIV+. If he is negative she can not get HIV. <br>  <br>  There is always a risk for HIV if you are having unprotected sex with someone who is infected. BUT oral sex is a very low risk.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	False.  Any unprotected sex, including oral, is a risk.  However, risk of transmission of HIV through oral sex is lower than risk of transmission through any other form of sexual activity.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	false!!|`|nOrWOZU4aa	I'm guessing that a guy is telling you this.|`|AA10928446	False. HIV is spread through exchange of bodily fluids. Theoretically if a woman has oral sex with an infected male she could become infected through microscopic abrasions in the delicate skin inside the mouth. Keep in mind that simple actions such as eating and brushing your teeth create small tears in the skin of the mouth which can open you up to possible HIV transmission.|`|zFpIgi0haa	If the guy has HPV and/or has warts on him, yes you can get them orally. You have HPV 24/7 for life and if you have sex with someone who has it, you will get it and if you have it, he will get it. There is a blood test at your gyn for HPV. It is nothing to mess with. I am HPV positive and have had laser evaporations of my cervix, leaves you more prone to have cervical cancer, had to have warts lasered from within and outside. Get yourself checked.|`|LJrBkT1zaa	If you have any cuts (even tiny ones) , open sores, mouth ulcers, or your gums are inflamed, these are ALL routes straight to the bloodstream for HIV.|`|fWYuJLQ5aa	False.|`|UUAFoGgLaa	possibly if your teeth cuts him and you suck his blood. literally.

fd5924c397f5b6b2236018882cccd4a7aa	You should tell her to get on the scale and if she still refuses take her to the exam room and tell the doctor she refused.  She is allowed to refuse any part of her examination.  Do not give out confidential patient information on another patient - it is ILLEGAL and you can lose your job.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	That's against the HIPPA law. Do you want to lose your job? <br>  Maybe tell her that it is illegal for you to repeat what her weight is to anyone but the doctor?|`|Tkno91Wwaa	Lie and tell her a pound more than the other patient really was. This way you're respecting both of them.|`|YgGi07Rpaa	what?|`|JPlVt9xYaa	I assume you are a helper in the clinic, it is hard to tell from your question, but let's assume you have a reason for being there. It is definitely not ethical for anyone connected with the clinic, office or staff to divulge information of this sort. Would you make one person feel bad to make another feel good? First of all, unless you are assisting in the weighing process or helping to keep records, you shouldn't have knowledge of this and you have an obligation to the duty of your position to keep silent about the matters that come before you. You are there to help and that does not include sharing any information that you learn from being in a trusted situation. Be nice, be sincere, be the kind of person that everyone can respect.|`|2vidb5ZAaa	I would tell her the weight of the other girl<br>  <br>  But, i dont think that would really help.<br>  <br>  I would tell her how to eat healthy and excercise and tell her mother to do that along with her to modivate her.<br>  <br>  Then come back and see if she gains the confidence to get weighed.|`|zKM9P2kYaa	dont give out the other girls info imagine if you did that to the first girl. besides its not the first girls place to know anyway.|`|hk7d5e6Faa	IT might but help but there is a law against sharing that info with other patients. If her weight gets around you coul dget in HUGE trouble. Its a personal risk but if you feel its impotant enough then go for it|`|w13sAqHnaa	Never give out any information about a patient. It's against the law.|`|N1ay8hzFaa	You don't say anything, because 1) you have an obligation to maintain confidentiality, which overrides your desire to be nice 2) you do not need to reinforce this girl's desire to compare herself to other girls. Tell her to focus on herself and her own health.
G9GRib7raa	Oatmeal is one of the healthiest carbs to eat. However, its a complex carb which isn't good before bed. I eat complex carbs with bfast, lunch and then veggies with dinner. Complex carbs give you energy and gives you that full feeling so you don't over eat through out the day. Dairy protein before bed is very beneficial. You can add fruit to cottage cheese as a evening snack....|`|FJpPCVTCaa	very healthy, i even add it to my breads.|`|QjgxH7Ouaa	sounds GREAT.|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	Definitely healthy. Try it with maple syrup.

And drink water and don't change your eat habits or exercise then you will loose weight.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	Yes because you're not putting a ton of fat and sugar into your body.

Whether you do it on a treadmill, or you do it outside, you should shred some pounds. We did sprints for Varsity soccer at my school and I lost weight really fast.<br>  <br>  Now on eating, eat strictly meat and salad. You get the protein you need from the meat and the nutrients you need from your salad. Try to drink only water, but some juices wouldn't hurt you either.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cc6jOYleaa	Take it from someone who has quit drinking soda. You really do not lose any weight.

Google Dr. Oz and he will tell you and give you an idea.|`|POA493NBaa	i cant tell you if you would loose weight but i sure will help your kidney's and When you drink water its serves as a fuel for the body and it filters out Pretty much everything|`|FyuaaiKIaa	depends on how many sodas ur drinking if you cut out 4 then thats about 500 calories a pound every 7 or 8 days put in 10 min of jogging or other cardio to kick it up.|`|vyU59X7zaa	You probably will drop only a few pounds, but don't expect continuous weight loss.|`|MOqtlWeoaa	If you pair that with exercise and healthier eating, you should see more prominent results.|`|6TFrcaoyaa	good for you! you most likely will. and youll definitally be healthier!|`|wec4Mixcaa	If you are serious about losing weight, have a look at the list of sites.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://the-fast--weight-loss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://the-fast--weight-loss.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <a href="http://weight--loss-help.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://weight--loss-help.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|uJKTR4d2aa	If you consistantly had 2 cans a day each day of the week you'd lost about a pound every 2 weeks.

Although it is difficult you need to work on it and learn to trust the man.  That does not mean that noting can go wrong but showing that you don't trust him is going to piss the man off.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Addendum:  I just checked out the photos.  You have absolutely nothing to worry about.  I'll pay money not to be with the girl in the first photo.

He may be true to his word that he loves you and only you.|`|Z1GR3x8uaa	i think its just because there is a place that jealousy hides in us and when someone tries to steel our guy, even though we know that they love us, it jumps out of it's hiding spot and reveals itself.<br>  because this is life and and it just isnt fair|`|AA11231063	what a fugly slut she is.<br>  omg.<br>  idk who would ever be intrested in her!!<br>  EW.|`|UBiIQ1wXaa	Dont worry about it....you are much hotter than that girl on that first page|`|S7lB5hQkaa	I don't think you have nothing to worry about. You are good looking by the way. What guy would pass you up? This girl is just hating on you. That's all. Jealously. You should applaud the haters out there for hating on you and your man. That means that YOU and YOUR man are doing a good job. No worries.<br>  <br>  I faced a similar problem in my life-time. My wife and I have been through a lot since we known each-other. Don't worry you will get through it. Everyone is insecure. Communicate with your man and you will be fine. All you can do from your part is be honest and do your best to be YOU. That's all. The rest is left to him. <br>  <br>  It is normal to feel the way you feel. Being from a foster home is more than justified to feel like you are not in "control". You have realize that the only person you can "control" is yourself. That's it. Be confident and have faith that everything will work it-self out. Everything in your life has happened for a reason. <br>  <br>  Take care
gVejeg9maa	You can relax.  If you hurt your eardrum(perforated eardrum) and the blood was from that you would be experiencing diminished hearing, likely a "stabbing" or "ice pick" feeling and often their is a constant "ringing" sound even when it's perfectly quiet.

It can also result in arch pain. Plantar Fasciitis is often caused by abnormal pronation of the foot and improper arch support. Contributing factors are weight gain, intense physical activity, jobs that require a lot of walking or standing on hard surfaces, or shoes with poor arch support.<br>  <br>  Research has found that a combination of proper exercises and arch support by wearing orthotic insoles can provide effective relief for plantar fasciitis.<br>  <br>  An explanation of the importance that proper arch support plays in controlling over-pronation, and some stretching exercises for relief are provided in the links below

Even if we practiced safe sex, a condom would likely break at some point.  I would also be afraid to administer first aid to my significant other.  And there is always the possibility that my love's HIV would progress into AIDS and that he would have to suffer.  Of course, I wouldn't abandon someone I loved as a result of illness, but it would pain me to watch someone I loved die.  My mother died when I was 14 following a long illness, and I do not wish to watch anyone else deteriorate.|`|tBXn97NNaa	I have to answer this question? Ugh.<br>  <br>  Probably not.

B12E4rYiaa	Some people's weight is distributed in a way that they don't look as heavy as opposed to someone whose weight is all in their stomach and very obvious.

anMng9O6aa	Uhhh...tea is tea.  It's water with herbs soaked in it, making it something else.  Doesn't dehydrate you, it's a good source of antioxidents! =)  No cancer for tea drinkers lol! =D|`|MCuoH07Taa	yes, tea is like water in the respect that you can count cups of tea consumed towards your daily goal of water consumption, but the same goes for most other beverages, such as juices, milk, etc. they all count as fluid intake because they primarily consist of water. things with a lot of caffeine can dehydrate you (colas and coffee), but tea doesn't really have enough caffeine to dehydrate you, especially if you drink herbal or green (black has the most, but still not much). the benefit of substituting some water with tea is that  white, green and black tea have a lot of antioxidants that water doesn't, and herbal teas also have beneficiary affects to your health depending on what kind you get. many studies confirm tea is just as effective at hydrating as water, but you can run into added calories if you add too much real sugar or honey.

Gsqt4ODYaa	Alright, since I can't see your tonsils, can you have a friend or something take a look at your tonsils?<br>  <br>  To see them, have them hold your tongue down with a butter knife, and shine a flashlight in your mouth, while you say aahhhhhh.<br>  <br>  If they are swollen, and have red and white gashes in them, that generally means you're sick.  It could be a minor tonsilitis, if your nurse said it wasn't strep, what did she do to assess that?  The only way to assess strep is with a swab, swabbing your tonsils, and then running it through a strep test.  They're really easy to do at a doctors office.<br>  <br>  If it's mono, you'll be feeling really tired, and fatigued.<br>  <br>  It could be a number of things, best to head to the doctors and get it checked out.<br>  <br>  Honestly though, if you wanted to wait a day or two and see if it gets any better, that would be ok.  Otherwise at the doctors, they'll give you cough medicine or antibiotics depending on what it is.|`|wwP3ONCFaa	you might be having tonsilitis. <br>  Gargle! If it hurts when you swallow, the sore area may be high enough in your throat for gargling to bathe and soothe it, So gargle frequently with one of the solutions below. But be aware that if you're hoarse or have a cough, the sore spot is further down, and gargling won't help.<br>  <br>  Saltwater. Mix 1 teaspoon of table salt in 1 pint of warm or room-temperature water. That's just enough salt to mimic the body's natural saline content, so you'll find it very soothing. Use every hour or so, but don't swallow the liquid if you're concerned about your sodium intake.<br>  <br>  Increase your fluid intake. Taking in as much fluid as you can will help hydrate your parched throat tissues, Although it doesn't really matter what you drink, he says, here are a few things you might want to avoid. Thick, milky drinks coat your throat and may produce mucus, making you cough and further irritating tissues; orange juice may burn an already inflamed throat; caffeine-containing beverages have a counterproductive diuretic effect.<br>  <br>  Reach for vitamin C. Vitamin C may help build up your tissues to fight the germs that are making your throat sore. Double the recommended daily requirement of 60 milligrams,<br>  <br>  other than that, its better to check it with a doctor|`|tZEOtpGpaa	You could just have an infection in your tonsils.  My son used to get that alot.  He just got his removed due to having strep throat too much and infections.  Just gargle some warm salt water and spit it out after you gargle it.  And you might want to go to the doctor just to be safe.  Good Luck|`|fc7b20afac68e7410c1951d371513a8daa	Sounds like your tonsils are infected,the cure is antibiotics.In the meantime,gurgle with lemon and salt.Also,eat some ice cream and stay away from hot drinks because the bacteria there spreads with heat.Get well soon!|`|BJERgbM5aa	Either, a common soar throat - maybe screaming too much.  Or tonsil infection or strep.  Since the nurse excluded the last two, you have a soar throat.  Drink juices, lower your voice!  You'll be fine.

bKIlVkOtaa	That's really good. Of course, 30 is better than twenty. But doing that on top of staying active through house work is commendable. It may take a while to see results but I'm sure that if you stick with it you will. Another good idea for weight loss is to not eat after 7:30 at night. That has really helped me, along with exercise and reduced calories. Best wishes to you!|`|xv7YlV29aa	ya it is because its better then not doing any at all.|`|a7f0a207efd4bfde7a89a1744872689baa	better than nothing|`|fOfqPATaaa	I'd say 30 min of more is perfect =)

Except it doesn't sound like you're eating much. I don't know how old you are but, just make sure you're not starving yourself ok? =); that will actually be counter productive because your body will think that it's dangerously low on food and will hoard everything you eat, making it hard to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about "low-fat" this and "low-fat" that. As far as I'm concerned, that either was started by someone lacking in nutrition research thought up and/ or a gimmick to get people to pay attention to something non-important so that they won't focus on the most important thing - the ingredients. As a rule of thumb, if you can't pronounce it, don't eat it, and the less ingredients it has, the better. It's unbelieveable the amount of chemicals, sweeteners, sugar, salt, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides are found in today's "food". Have you ever noticed how lots of people are completely addicted to certain foods even though it makes them feel bad afterwards? Learn to pay attention to the food labels and learn to listen to your body.<br>  <br>  More specifically, I'd switch the bowl of cheerios with homemade oatmeal - stay away from quakers instant oatmeal - and mix up a bowl of some oat bran, quick/rolled oats, a pinch of sea salt and some minced fruit, pour some hot water ontop and voila! A delicious breakfast without all the crap from the colorfully packaged stuff.<br>  <br>  Cooking your own food is a big step to eating healthier, but when it comes to soups and the such, be careful about what type of broth/ bouillon cubes you use, many of them use msg and other things you should go without. Be adventurous and make your own from a variety of spices or search the internet for recipes. Or use a spice mix like Mrs Dash (read all the labels, most of them have no msg, no salt, no "natural flavors" but not all). <br>  <br>  Great on the whole wheat noodles as well, but why not try a different kind of grain? Like rice, millet, quiona etc. I've tried many of these as cooked grains, pasta, crackers etc and they all taste great and are very nutritious. Give wheat a break and go for something "exotic" =). One thing I've read often is that it's a bad idea to mix grains with proteins - like meat/ fish and nuts/ potato.<br>  <br>  If you're interested, I've got a bunch of recipes and lots of tips on eating healthy and making smart food choices on my blog Eat Smarter! The No-Crap-Diet <a href="http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://nocrapdiet.wordpress.com/</a> It sounds like you eat pretty well, I'd really love to hear any suggestions or recipes you might have =) Feel free to ask me any questions you might have, and keep at it!|`|bsqYJ0suaa	after lunch have a snack like a nutrition bar or some assorted nuts (unsalted).

QjwBMQbjaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I have Borderline Personality Disorder and apart from Cognitive behavioural therapy which in itself is hard enough to get there is no treatments or groups at all where I am from (N.Ireland). Borderline Personality is apparently best treated by Dialectal behavioural therapy but we do not have this treatment.<br>  <br>  The groups and treatments for personality disorders are very sparse in my opinion- perhaps they are better in the USA?|`|TdqeC0vmaa	borderline and avoidant<br>  <br>  I know theirs cbt for borderline I havent a clue whats out there for avpd. But I do not have 50 to 100 dollars an hour to drop for therapy. And I think its a crock that they say cbt is the therapy to use for bpd but do not provide it for those who are of low to no income. <br>  <br>  Guess you have to be wealthy to have good mental health. <br>  So I haven't been able to try any treatment for either. Ive been to a free intern therapist a few times. But I knew more than they did and they told me that I was beyond what they could do. So that obviously didnt work.|`|skJihSWSaa	i do find here is a lack of treatment. I was offered CBT but left the area before an appointment came through.

As long as it happens infrequently, it's probably not cause for concern. However, if you regularly salivate sooner than you  wish — such as before you eat or shortly afterward — you may have a condition known as premature salivation. <br>  <br>  There is no known treatment or cure for premature salivation. The condition progressively deteriorates until you are salivating almost constantly. <br>  <br>  Premature salivation is also an early warning sign of leprosy. Please see a doctor ASAP to get tested.|`|27IeVZNeaa	She is kidding. People droll when food smells good, its a natural reaction|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	That was a joke.|`|eMPeOsRBaa	haha she was kidding.|`|h35XA5Piaa	That's either the most funny...or sad question I've seen so far today.|`|QeFqUkjvaa	This sounds very serious, you either need to see a surgeon and have your saliva glands removed, or your lips sewn shut.

Besides calories you should look for carbs, protein, sugars and etc on the foods. Just because a cupcake has 12 calories does not make it healthy.

HD29O7Ataa	False<br>  <br>  Dissociative amnesia is actually a medical condition rather than a traumatic condition.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dissociative amnesia has psychological roots and is completely unrelated to traumatic amnesia. While a traumatic form of amnesia and dissociative forms of amnesia may show similar signs/symptoms, the way to differ between the two is to identify if trauma is/was a mechanism of injury.
XU4ZIlBuaa	You should try and talk to her about it first. Like seriously sit her down and do not let her get up until she tells you what's going on. If she's your best friend, you should be able to do this. It might take a while to get it out of her, but you have to let her know that you're there for her - to support her through a bad time. And encourage her to eat also. Don't go and buy her McDonalds or anything, that's just a total "You are a twig. Gain a few pounds for heavens sake." Just like get her to eat little things at first and then gradually move up to the bigger foods. Just let her know that you're gonna be there for her. If you tell someone before she's ready it might turn out really bad. But if she refuses to talk and everything, then you probably should tell her parents or a dean/teacher.|`|7utsLRfyaa	You could tell the counsellor also another thing that has worked for many with an eating disorder is taking  picture<br>  this may sound stupid but go swimming with your friend "helping her to lose weight" and then like take photos ogether when in the changing rooms like of you posing in ur swimsuits, i know that sounds TOTALLY wrong but it isnt, show her the pics of how skinny she is and it will shock her into gaining weight<br>  good luck<br>  x|`|uKXgg9heaa	She seems to be anorexic they seem to have distorted body images and really need mental help.

4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Lubricate, lubricate, lubricate.  And go s-l-o-w.<br>  <br>  After you get used to it, going faster feels better but for a beginner, go slow.  Take it easy because it will hurt a bit.  It's different for everyone but I would say at least a 5 on the pain scale.<br>  <br>  Take it easy and don't rush it.|`|b7U7uoTpaa	Obviously I am not a woman, but I am in the medical profession and I personally love having anal sex.<br>  First off.  The pain factor is different for everyone.  Some girlfriends just couldn't take it, some wanted to be jackhammered and loved it.<br>  My advice it to start slow and work your way up to full on anal.<br>  If you feel more comfortable, start by doing it by yourself.  Try masturbating and then using a well lubricated finger or small vibrator.  That will give you an idea of how it will feel just passing through the anus.<br>  If you prefer to try it with a partner, I suggest having him go down on you and have him insert a well lubricated finger into you anus and gauge it from there.  If that works move to a small vibrator, then a little larger one.<br>  Take your time, be patient, and use lots of lube.  Also, there is a product call Anal Ease (also Booty Ease...etc).  It is a cream that has benzocaine in it, which will slightly numb the anal tissue and help you to relax.<br>  There are a lot of nerve endings around the anal area that both men and women have.  If your boy friend really wants you to try it, ask him to let you try it on him too.  You never know, it is quite stimulating and he may like it.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	im regarded as a local expert around here, some even say that i am an anal connoisseur or is that a anus connoisseur... anyway, i say use plenty of lube and if you are with a loving partner, he will be gentle anyway, so you will be able to communicate throughout|`|OnDIrxNEaa	This is terrible but I was pretty drunk the only time I really did it, and he wasn't that big so it didn't hurt too much... definitely hurt though!<br>  I, personally, don't care for it but a lot of women do.

[Not excruciatingly bad.]<br>  It even hurts the next few times too.<br>  But, the best thing to do is to make sure you have enough lubrication and make sure your partner enters you slowly and gently.<br>  [Nothing fast and rough the first time !]<br>  After the first couple of times, there's little pain [if any.]<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  Good luck !<br>  =)|`|skV9BRriaa	The pain in my case was horrific a definite 10, i guess it depends on how big  your man is, but i wouldn't recommend it. I also can't understand why males like it so much, if you do decide to go through with it lube and relaxation are the key, and make sure he doesn't go from one hole to the other because  any trace of poop in the vagina can give you a nasty infection|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	Much of this answer depends on the person you are with. If you are with someone that is slow, patient, and knows how to do it (clipped nails, etc.) then there may not be any pain.

Let me just say its not so much painful as it is UNCOMFORTABLE. Quite frankly, it feels just like taking a massive ****. There I said it, there's no other way to describe the feeling......Anyway, when he first goes in, be sure to use LOTS of lubrication, and go SLOW! You have to relax because if he's trying to get in, and you're squeezing, it will be painful. Just relax and push a little to get your muscles to not resist. (Does that make sense?) Okay, then when he goes in, it actually does feel pleasurable, but as he pulls out, it feels like number two......haha. <br>  <br>  All in all, it only feels good if he stays deep inside. Otherwise, as he pulls out to gain thrust, its going to feel like your going to the bathroom. Just be prepared.<br>  <br>  Oh and the first time I tried it, I had a hard time concentrating because I didn't want to accidentally fart or do something nastier! hahahaha, So just be sure you go to the bathroom beforehand and don't eat anything that makes you gassy! <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|3vWpUXsmaa	Okay, the first time will be a 10 in pain. You never really get used to it and no matter how many times you do it, it will be quite uncomfortable in the beginning. So relax, make sure he is WELL lubed and just do it. Sometimes a ********* helps. It's worth trying at least once.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	The pain is as good as the joy...make sure your man knows what he's doing and allow yourself to take your sweet time-as long as you need-to take it all in.  It'll hurt about a 8 -8 1/2 (i'd say)but remember to RELAX and do it very very slooowly and LOTS and LOTS of lube...as much as you need....GOOD LUCK, AND YOU GO GIRL!!!!!!!|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	All I can say is, it's worth trying twice (because first time will probably hurt, if you're at all nervous).<br>  Women who are "psychologically attuned" to it can c.u.m from anal stimulation alone.
IrBzsJpWaa	relax your muscles and squat down.<br>  just push it in slowly and a 45-degree angle,<br>  aiming toward your lower back.<br>  it should go in painlessly.<br>  but if it hurts, then try a smaller size.|`|bbR79Js0aa	Yes pads are a burden .<br>  <br>  Let me help you out a little, okay [:<br>  <br>     2. The best time to practice inserting a tampon is during the heavy part of your period. The tampon should glide inside your vagina easily without any discomfort.<br>  <br>     3. Decide if you prefer to insert the tampon standing or sitting. If sitting is your preference, sit on the toilet. If you want to try standing, putting one foot on the bathtub helps.<br>  <br>     4. Hold the tampon applicator in your right hand if you are right-handed, or left if left-handed.<br>  <br>     5. Use your thumb and middle finger to hold the bottom of the larger, outer tube.<br>  <br>     6. Point the tip of the applicator toward your vagina, facing slightly towards the back. The smaller tube should be pointed away from your body.<br>  <br>     7. Use your other hand to open your vagina.<br>  <br>     8. Place the tip of the applicator at the opening of your vagina.<br>  <br>     9. Gently push the smaller end of the applicator in until it is <br>  completely inside the larger outer tube. This pushes the tampon into your vagina and out of the tube.<br>  <br>    10. With your thumb and middle finger still on the outer tube, release the smaller tube and let the strings dangle freely.<br>  <br>    11. Gently pull the two tubes out together.<br>  <br>    12. Dispose of the applicator according to the manufactuer's instructions.<br>  <br>    13. When you are ready to remove the tampon, gently pull the withdrawl strings down and forward. The used tampon may be flushed down the toilet.<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  <br>     1. Lubricating the rounded end of the tampon with a water-based lubricant such as K-Y Jelly can make insertion easier the first few times. Don't use petroleum jelly.<br>  <br>     2. Always read the manufactuer's instructions throughly before using any type of tampon.<br>  <br>     3. If the tampon feels uncomfortable it is probably not inserted far enough into your vagina. Try again with a new tampon.|`|fDGesUPJaa	Its really ok if you're not ready for tampons yet.  Maybe you're wearing the wrong kind of pads if you hate them.

When I went to the doc he said that when I was little someone who had a cold sore must of kissed me on the nose and that's how I got it. (I'd love to go back and punch that person!) Once you get the virus it usually is generally located in the same place. There's not much you can do! He did prescribe be acyclovir which if you take at the first sign of that itch it usually doesn't even develop. I get them on top of my nose, under my nose, inside my nose, and usually when I am sick or just about to be sick. It's the same thing as getting a cold sore on your lip.

AA10928446	First off, do not panic. Almost all cysts are benign. Most people experience no symptoms and do not even know they have them until they are found on ultrasound. All a cyst is is a fluid filled sac located inside of your kidney. When you see your doctor in 3 weeks he/she may ask you questions regarding any symptoms that you may have been experiencing. If you are not experiencing any symptoms your doctor may decide that they want to have you undergo another scan in 6 months to keep an eye on it. You did not mention your age but more than half of people over the age of 50 have cysts in their kidneys. I hope this helps.|`|lbb4luo2aa	renal means kidney. so its a cyst of the kidney, sounds scary. o.0 are they giving you meds or anything for it?<br>  <br>  im sure though, if it was something really bad they woulldve told you, or told your doctor who wouldve called you.|`|zFpIgi0haa	A simple benign, not cancerous, will not cause you to get kidney cancer.

d60e8f20b683cbea453ebac252df94f5aa	I have had this chronically since I was a child.  Often at night before I go to bed i will put boiling water on the stove to put moisture in the house.  I also use a humidifier with just water.  There are over the counter saline nasal sprays that help lubricate the nasal passages which do help somewhat. Stay away from Afrin or other sinus sprays , they can be addictive.<br>  <br>  Also, take a hot shower before you go to bed, let the warm water hit your face and forehead to loosen the mucus and blow your nose when you get out of the shower.  This helps with the overnight post nasal drip.|`|sg6JieT8aa	well, I am a yogi ( person who does yoga ) and try this tip to clear your nose. put down your pointer and middle finer. so you pinki ring and thumb is still up. place the thumb on one nostrol. breath in and out slowly ONLY out of your nose. (1 nostrol, one that is uncovered ) even if it seems difficult to breathe, slowly alternate to the next nostrol with a different hand. when the other hand is placed on, you may remove the other. after about 8-10 breaths on each, you can notice all of your snot has drained down. you have to do it a lot though. great to get it out. also try halls and/or fishermans friend. breathe right nasal strips, and just rest. it will go away sooooon. also maybe to some other yoga. hope this helps. good luck and get well..piper|`|bd12e48132951f215b7fe910f10580d4aa	Mucinex works great for me.

PImvmP1paa	Okay.<br>  <br>  Most females are on birth control now-a-days, so they think they're protected and that's why they have sex. <br>  <br>  You don't know for sure if they have been sleeping together for 7 months now. They may have been going out/dating/in a relationship for 7 months and they could have just started having sex with each other a month or two ago.<br>  <br>  She may not even be comparing a human life to that of a kitten. She may have said that as a little joke for dramatic relief. You know, like the scenes that they have in a drama that are supposed to be a bit funny to relieve the dramatic feeling? <br>  <br>  It's called naive. It's not being naive if the guy is a jerk and would cheat on her. Now, if she knew he would and wouldn't think he was, then that's naive. <br>  <br>  Being insecure is another thing, because believe it or not, you will be insecure in about 4 years.

Why? Because people are either sluts, or they're just simply ready to have sex with someone they care about and love. <br>  <br>  I do believe that it can be the pressure from guys, but if you're stong and not ready, you won't give in. <br>  <br>  Did you ever stop to think that the persons parents are trusting and believe that if they say be home at this time, they will be? <br>  <br>  Did you ever stop to think that maybe the parents don't care about them?<br>  <br>  Did you ever stop to think that maybe they have sex during the day when they're alone or watching a movie in their room with each other, and that their parents trust that they won't do anything innappropraite or that they're not ready for?<br>  <br>  I don't think you did.|`|t1aYyBHWaa	I know how you feel.

If it doesn't go away, go see a doctor I know you don't like them but at least you'll be able to get it treated.<br>  <br>  And no...I don't think a lump on your thumb is going to kill you.

AA10815212	Seboxone (Buprenorphine) is an agent used to treat chronic opiod addiction and also has been useful to treat chronic pain in the transdermal patch form.  After your doctor sent you to a pain management clinic, he/she is more than likely not inclined to go against their recommendations (DEA reviewing prescribing habits for narcotics would question this as well).  That said, there is no reason you can't go back to the pain clinic to report failure of their therapy.  Chronic pain is one of the most difficult things to treat in all of medicine.  It is not surprising, the very first thing they used did not "fix" the problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	suboxone is given to patients to help wean them off of opiods or regular pain killers. apparently, the doctor who gave it to you wanted to get you off the lortab. did he even discuss this switch with you? suboxone contains two ingredients, one of which counteracts the effects of opiods, which could be why you are not getting the pain relief you need. if you were not addicted to pain killers and did not request help getting off of them, then i would tell your doctor that you feel you were put on this drug under false pretenses and that it is not the same thing as a regular pain killer. here is a link to suboxone's website that will tell you more about it. i would get a new doctor or tell your old doctor that you are upset about being put on this drug without it's full effects being explained to you... <a href="http://www.suboxone.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.suboxone.com/</a>|`|hieQHR0daa	Unfortunately there are some pains which cannot be resolved by any of the current medications. Nerve pain usually comes from nerve damage and it is very difficult to find something which resolves it. You could ask to be referred to a "pain control" clinic if they have them where You are. You would have a waiting time but then you would be offered a variety of therapies.<br>  Some pain can be treated successfully with antidepressants, some with acupuncture etc. I really think a Pain clinic would be your best  bet.<br>  <br>  My mother has a similar problem but she has not found a medication or treatment that is completely successful in relieving her nerve damage pain.|`|emKXU1QFaa	Some pain killers work better than others for different individuals.  Also you can build up a tolerance to your medication so 2 doesn't work like it did before now you need 4.<br>  <br>  If your Dr. sent you to a pain mgmt center go back to them and ask to be switched from Seboxan to another pain killer (sorry don't know if this drug does more than get rid of the pain).

If so there has to be a reason that your pain management doctor decided to prescribe this for you.Your medical records would have been sent to him from your regular doctor to begin with so there must have been something in them to think this would be the best thing for you.You have the right to see your own medical file.I suggest as long as your over 21 that you ask to see them.You can't take them from the office.You can get a copy of them for yourself but they'll charge you usually by the page and it will add up.If you want to see them call and make an appointment so they know and can have them available for you.This is your right by law so don't let them discourage you.Your only other choice is to come right out and ask the doctor.

Relax your muscles. <br>   -- Press on two pressure points at the back of the neck.  These<br>       points are about two inches apart, just below the base of<br>       the skull.  Press for a minute or two.  This releases<br>       endorphins that help against pain. <br>   -- Massage or press on the fleshy area between thumb and<br>       forefinger.<br>   -- Gently lean the head to left or right to stretch the neck muscles.<br>       Massage and relax any tense muscles.<br>   -- Avoid sources of stress.

If you do turn to this, try Tylenol, or anything with ibuprofen in it.You should also stay away from tv and computer monitors, they aren't any good for you when you have migraines.

Ebola virus and Marburg virus originate primarily in the tropical forests of Africa and cause hemorrhagic fevers that can lead to extensive bleeding (hemorrhage), organ failure and shock. Ebola virus and Marburg virus initially move from animals to humans, then can spread from person to person through direct contact with blood and other body fluids.<br>  <br>  The first reported cases of hemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola virus were in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) and Sudan in 1976. Outbreaks in the 1990s and early 2000s also occurred in sub-Saharan Africa.<br>  <br>  Public health officials identified the Marburg virus in 1967, when laboratory workers in Marburg, Germany, developed hemorrhagic fever after handling infected African green monkeys. Since then, limited outbreaks of Marburg infection have occurred sporadically in southern and eastern Africa.<br>  <br>  No treatment or vaccines are available for hemorrhagic fevers caused by the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus. But for most people, the risk of infection is extremely low.<br>  <br>  This is an example of what type of language to expect. Hope you find what you need.

Hq6nSl1Qaa	First problem, you are using radiant heat.  Only gas or oil heat drys the air of excess relative moisture during the winter.  Drying your clothes on the radiator compounds the problem by putting that moisture into the air.  This increases the relative humidity to a range where mold will grow easily and start eating latex (paint), clothes, dust (dead skin), etc etc.<br>  <br>  All it will take is a bad cold, especially a chest cold, and the mold proteins floating around that room will start the life-long process of allergies for your children.  The further this progresses, the more likely they will also develop asthma.<br>  <br>  Another problem could be your bathroom.  Hot showers followed by an open door to the apartment will boost relative humidity in the apartment.  You need to be conscious of how much moisture is getting into the air.  When it is high, then crack two windows on opposite sides of the apartment, preferably one high and one low.  This will draw air with much lower moisture into the apartment and allow higher moisture air to escape.<br>  <br>  Other than that, a dehumidifier is what you need.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	If you're drying washing on the radiators you are creating moisture, which causes mould - you need to keep the windows open to prevent moisture in the air.<br>  <br>  To get rid of the mould that's already there, wash the area down with a mixture of fairy liquid, hot water and a little bit of bleach, that will kill all the fungal spores, otherwise it will just come back.|`|xeW6Mvbdaa	You need to open a window, you need a vent in the room, plus a heat source.

It'll happen when it happens, no way to know when that will be.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|lAQRpH2Iaa	I don't know if it means you are going to get you period but if you have a lot of this discharge and it has an odor you may have an infection.

Ow6lKFXiaa	Make an appointment to see your doctor and discuss this since you have questions, although he/she can probably answer the question over the phone as you've already been examined.<br>  <br>  You probably don't need to do more have the TSH, T3 and T4 tests redone periodically to keep an eye on things.  Doctors usually look at the results of all 3 tests to determine if treatment is needed.  Since only one of yours is outside normal, and very slightly, there is nothing to treat at this time. Had the TSH been very high but your T3 and T4 still normal, your doctor would have had additional tests done and then decided what, if any, treatment was appropriate.

But you have to keep at it.  Some people like to exercise everyday which is fine too.  It also helps to have a schedule and rotate what type of activities you do each day.  Like some aerobics and a walk one day and some strength training the next with some ab excercises.  It's all up to you how you want to do it.  Everyone has their own way and what works for them.  You just have to figure it out.|`|oJ2bwej9aa	You need to do more research.<br>  <br>  Your body gains the benefits from exercise when it is at rest.<br>  <br>  This is when the cells repair themselves, add to their systems and gain growth etc.<br>  <br>  They can't do that whilst you are exercising. That's also why elite athletes and sports people have massive durations of rest.|`|g8pRhElsaa	that looks good to me...making sure you have a rest day and alternating cardio and weight lifting.<br>  <br>  i'm not sure about the calories (since i'm a girl, mine are obv different than yours), but make sure to get a lot of your calories from lean protein! it can help you add muscle without adding fat.|`|POA493NBaa	you don't want to over work your body or put to much stress on your body but if you think you are doing good continue but you are on a good track keep it up
twuEvpiVaa	no lol it doesn't really matter how old you are..and basically if you haven't um shoved anything up there before then it's gonna hurt. maybe you should try the smallest size..also if you're trying to put it in while youu don't have your period, like if your practicing or whatever then it'll really hurt. just relax while you're putting it in. you won't screw up an organ, you can't push in a tampon that far. click on hte link cause i don't wanna explain it word for word hahaa! <a href="http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/yourperiod_inserttampon.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/yourperio...</a><br>  there are also a million other videos/articles on google that will show you how. hope i helped|`|Y6K9jwXzaa	try putting one leg up on the toilet or the side of the tub and point the tampon towards your back while inserting it. you may not be spreading your legs far enough. it could also be, if your not sexually active, that your hymen is not broken and that's what hurts. it's not going to mess anything up so don't worry.|`|TIqFAXo1aa	nope ur vag is like a pocket.  You cant get it in there wrong.    Get smaller ones maybe?<br>  <br>  also if you are a virgin there is a small piece of tissue called your hymen, it could be the source of the pain.   <br>  <br>  But it shouldnt keep you from using tampons.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|CBbsulYCaa	Follow the instructions on the box carefully and you will be ok.

Use the ones with applicators that way you can't go wrong (anyway you can't really mess it up theres nowhere for it to go).<br>  It's more an uncomfortable feeling you get for the first few times you try it, also it sounds like your using a tampon with a high absorbency rate, use the lowest absorbency one first then see where you go from there eg do you need to go up a level etc etc..<br>  Also sit down and read the leaflet carefully that comes with the packet.<br>  Good luck!|`|BRDqfAy3aa	see below pictures - all steps how to use the tampon

8R5fnAGlaa	I havent personally had my period yet (that I know of, i might have it now) but i have a ton of research, yes, it is sometimes feeling like you are about to pee, sometimes you get cramps, sometimes girls get PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome, VERY COMMON!!!) it's like being moody, migranes( ten times worse then a headache, and sensitive to light, and sound) so yeah, also you might feel sticky in between there. so i hoped this helps.|`|lAQRpH2Iaa	Well kind of but you can tell it comes from a different area.

But usually you can't feel it, really.|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	You don't feel like to have to pee because pee and the blod come out of 2 different holes. You get cramps in you stomach a few days before.

678oGIupaa	Hi i am a dental nurse it sounds like you have Temporomandibular joint condition (TMJ) this can be caused by the biting of nails grinding your teeth and clenching teeth.<br>  <br>  there are simple exercises you can do to help this, one for example is if you put your tongue on the top of the palette as far back as possible and open and close your jaw. <br>  <a href="http://www.maxfaxsho.co.uk/index_files/Page8028.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.maxfaxsho.co.uk/index_files/P...</a><br>  <br>  your dentist may refer you to the hospital for x-rays and second opinions and he may make you rubber teeth trays to wear at night to help the problem.<br>  <br>  TMJ cant be fixed but it can be prevented form getting worse and it can be helped by relieveing pain and lock jaw. however surgery may be needed depending the seriousness of the problem.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Some chiropractors would claim to be able to fix this, by what they call " adjustments". Not all chiropractors can do this, as it is an advanced technique. Try first ringing up a Chiropractic college to get a name of someone who can do this. It involves the chiropractor putting his ( gloved) hand into your mouth and twisting your jaw fairly gently.<br>  The chiropractic college might offer you a clinic-tutor, who may charge less for the treatment if you offer to be a teaching-clinic patient, so that students can watch this special technique being demonstrated.|`|AA11103493	Go back to the consultant - didn't he give you tips or suggestions on how to fix it?|`|tGEMwgyBaa	Try and get a second opinion by another dentist, I work in a dental office and this is not normal, it sounds like you have a TMJ problem, ask your dentist if they have an appliances you can wear to help with the clicking. However, if it's really bad you may need surgery to correct the problem. When you go into the dentist ask them it could be TMJ and I think you will at least be on the right track. I hope this helps|`|50ca49acd54c91d903d473e093ea2d38aa	my jaw does this too, but it pops really loud, just like popping knuckles. There is an actual name for this.

Can you imagine having sex with another guy? If that turns you off, your not bi! But like I said, there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING BI! But some people think that there is, and you just have to deal with that.|`|9YM3EtdSaa	i don't think it's wierd because you can like who you want and u should'nt need anyone elses opinions|`|9Djc08mSaa	I really think its natural be who you are on the inside|`|ugRN86bYaa	Yes, but no worse than my sins. God will deliver you from all of it. Being a child of God is as easy as ABC.<br>  <br>  A. Admit that you are a sinner in need of God.<br>  A relationship with Jesus Christ begins with your admission that you need God. You must admit you need God to do three things:<br>  <br>  You need God to forgive you of your sins, those attitudes or actions that don't meet God's standards.<br>  " If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:8-9). <br>  You need God to give you eternal life.<br>  " For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 6:23). <br>  You need God to show you His purpose for your life.<br>  " The thief [Satan] does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I [Jesus] have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly." (John 10:10). <br>  B. Believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again for your sins.<br>  Believe That Jesus Died For Your Sins<br>  The penalty for your sin is death. But God loves you so much, He provides a way for you to escape that penalty.<br>  " For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." (John 3:16).<br>  Jesus can and will save anyone from an eternity without God. He died and rose again for your justification, to right your relationship with God. <br>  Believe that Jesus Rose From The Dead<br>  " He [Jesus] was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification." (Romans 4:25).<br>  Belief in the death and resurrection of Jesus for your sins is essential for salvation, but it is not enough.<br>  " You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe--and tremble." <br>  (James 2:19).<br>  You must do more than believe in Jesus. You must confess him as Lord of your life; He must be the one in control. <br>  C. Confess Jesus Christ as Lord of your life.<br>  Confessing Jesus as Lord means to commit total control of your life to Christ. You give him the ownership of your life. He becomes your new boss. If you confess Jesus as Lord of your life, the Bible says you will be saved.<br>  <br>  "If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9-10).<br>  <br>  The following prayer is one you can say right now to confess Jesus as Lord and ask Him to save you:<br>  <br>  Dear God, I admit I am a sinner in need of You. Please forgive me of my sins and give me abundant life here on earth and eternal life with You in heaven. I believe Jesus died and rose again for my sins. I confess Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior of my life. Thank You for saving me. In Jesus' name, Amen.<br>  Scripture Promise if you have accepted Christ:<br>  <br>  "And the witness is this, that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life. <br>  <br>  These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life." (1 John 5:11-13 ).|`|Z4OeKTToaa	if you need to talk msg me|`|ZRu2DxEqaa	No its not weird. Your just questioning your sexuality. There is nothing wrong with that.

Maybe not<br>  But maybe since you control the way you feel....you shouldn't destroy your brain and make yourself suffer.|`|AA10892706	You are paying way too much attention to the woman's friends reaction. Obviously, the woman you were with did not have a problem with your actions.  She obviously shared what happened with her friend. You seem like a very decent person. Please don't let this take over your life. I remember one night, I too was drunk in a bar, and just for the hell of it, I leaned over the bar and started making out with the bartender.  We all know what happens when people drink...we become more sociable...so to speak. So please remember, what you did with the woman was obviously consensual - because SHE did NOT say anything to you about what you were doing. Her friend is probably an idiot so just forget she even said that.|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	ok dude, thats in the past, she probably liked it, because seriously if she hadnt she wouldve backed away or heer friends wouldve defended her, so no i guess it was just something that happened, quit feling so depressed|`|h3NJO9dWaa	I'm sure she's fine, she was probably drunk too and if it bothered her she most likely would have said something. Unfortunately things like that happen alot and if she felt like she had been assaulted her friend would have said "hey you are the one who assaulted my friend" instead of stick your tongue down her throat.<br>  <br>  You sound like a nice guy, I know guys who have done way way worse things and I hope they feel bad for it|`|kcmRROk0aa	Let me share with you my impression of you based on what you have written here: you are good guy who is waayyy too hard on himself. :-D<br>  <br>  Do you think back on the situation and feel angry at yourself? Embarrassed?<br>  <br>  Do you wish you could go back and change it?<br>  <br>  Do you wish you could just forget about it?<br>  <br>  Do you wonder if the girl still thinks about what happened? Maybe you wonder if she still talks to her friends about it? Maybe you wonder if they joke about it (and you)?<br>  <br>  You are giving this girl/this situation too much of your time and energy. There is NOTHING you can do about it now!<br>  <br>  I would bet you are the kind of sensitive soul who hates to make mistakes. I would bet that you *hate* embarrassment.<br>  <br>  I can't say *why* your mind is choosing to "torture" you with this memory, but I think there is something deeper going on.<br>  <br>  You didn't assault her. Chances are she doesn't give any thought to the situation.<br>  <br>  Can you forgive yourself and move on?<br>  <br>  Forgiveness means letting go of the hope that the past could be different. (I didn't come up with that -- I read/heard it somewhere.)|`|tSnpPTAwaa	Wow -- okay, first thing's first -- you are absolutely RIGHT when you say that if the woman was not okay with what you were doing or if she did not like it, she would have pushed you away or asked you to stop.  She pretty much gave you the green light so at that moment, to you, it was the right thing to do.  So don't feel guilty about doing it.  Second of all, girls and their friends -- add some alcohol and guys and we have the potential of acting silly or plain out stupid.  She could have been playing it off to her friends making it seem like you were really into her (which it sounds like you were) and that she wasn't (because trust me, girls can be mean and catty like that).  Her friend took it upon herself to go up to you and make that retarded remark -- so what?  Doesn't mean anything.  I think you are reading way too much into her friend's comment.<br>  I'm really sorry that you've gone thru so much over this.  It really IS sad because it really wasn't worth it.  You did not sexually assault this woman.  You did not do anything she wasn't okay with.  Just accept that it was something that happened and let it go.  You sound like a super nice guy who met a girl he really liked and went along with what he was feeling at that moment and that's it.  II've seen this happen a lot.  I really hope you stop torturing yourself over this.  That girl has probably moved on and forgotten about that incident and you're over here letting it run your life.  People make mistakes, do things they later regret, but that's life.  You live and you learn.  But i don't think you did anything wrong here.
xbKnkxyoaa	You need to go see the doctor. When you masturbate and ejaculate it does not "empty" your balls. Your semen is actually stored in a little thing called the prostrate. There shouldn't be any reason besides something medically wrong. Its NOT from masturbating. Don't be embarrassed to tell your parents, you need to go in.|`|sCCjAKllaa	No. Even if you ejaculate 20x a day, there is no way your testicle should ever decrease in size. Consult your parents or face not havin a healthy sex life in the future.

0jwXQPCoaa	Bipolar Disorder sometimes involves what are called "psychotic features." Typically, these are auditory or visual hallucinations. Usually, voices telling you bad things about yourself.<br>  <br>  Regardless of what psychologists will tell you, these voices are almost always demonic. The Bible explains what is going on.<br>  <br>  If your symptoms cannot be controlled by Biblical interventions--and you are a danger to yourself or others--then you need to be evaluated for medication.|`|Cpmfx6L9aa	Oh yeah. Without medication or the understanding of the disorder it can happen. It's caused by stress.
JTHtrla9aa	WATER AND SOAP IS POSSIBLY THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO!<br>  <br>  despite what people may think, soap is bad! soap dries out the skin, which then makes the skin produce more oil, increasing the chance of more acne to come about.<br>  <br>  Acne which appears on the back, signifies that your skin condition is quite bad, i reccomend you go to your skin specialist, usually they will suggest medication which in the first week you will see BIG improvements.<br>  <br>  But if you don't have time for that, i suggest maybe using fake tan, or waterproof zinc, to cover up the acne on your back, YES- THAT MAY BE BAD FOR YOUR SKIN, but i guess it will make you alot more self concious.|`|sxNSGu3eaa	for a FAST way, just smear your back with concealer.<br>  <br>  but it seems like youre over-washing your skin, which can lead to irritation. lay off the acne pads. just wash your back in the shower and see if that will help. also, if you've been sweating from a physical activity, be sure to change and wash right after so the salt doesnt linger and clog your back pores.|`|yvMmTEOCaa	use a scrub like St. Ives apricot scrub and then use a drying acne medicine like neutrogena.(Salicyc acid) Oxy products work really well because they dry the acne up (which is what gets rid of it).

Many people have a lot.<br>  Mainly it is the teenagers that stress over it though. Why? Cuz teenagers tend to tease more and put each other down to make themselves feel better than someone else.  <br>  Some people keep doing this as they grow into adults too so it is best to just learn how to deal with people who want to make you feel self conscious.  <br>  Act with confidence.  Act like it doesn't bother you.  Get ready to put the light back on the rude person and make them see their OWN behavior is the issue!  Prepare an answer in advance so if anyone says "Ew... gross." to you ... you have a comeback... ...Like..."You mean your hair/face?"  "You mean your manners?" or "Well, aren't you 'Little Miss Manners?'"   "How kind/polite of you to notice!"|`|aSdUzlIiaa	try this it's GREAT!! ?:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearskin/index.view" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinid.com/econsumer/clearski...</a>|`|fjOMthF1aa	Go out in the sun for 15 minutes a day & have someone wash your back with witch hazel..

Use your hands and be extremely gentle.<br>  Visit a dermatologist so they can prescribe you some special medication; my dermatologist prescribed me Clindamycin Phosphate lotion and it got rid of all my back acne within a couple months.<br>  Keep in mind that before any acne gets better, it'll get worse first.<br>  <br>  And for now, don't sweat it; people won't judge you or think you're gross because you have back acne.<br>  Acne is normal and extremely common.<br>  Just be confident, and have fun!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Its only 20 bucks and it has left my skin clear and soft. I still have a few breakouts every so often and i still have scaring from previous acne but it really has worked well in keeping my skin clear. I also scrub a couple times a week with the clinique face scrub. Its a little expensive but it is well worth your money. I have been using the same tube since december.

sKTmxnx1aa	If you are new to your period, that could be why they are so irregular.  No, you can't get pregnant from humping your pillow.  If you are experiencing stomach pain, I would see a doctor.  Hope this helps, and have a great day!|`|PImvmP1paa	1. If you're new to having your period, it's completely normal.<br>  <br>  2. Discharge is normal. It's there all the time. It helps clean the vagina, helps lubricate the vagina for when you start to have sex, and helps sperm travel. <br>  <br>  3. You can't have cervical cancer unless you're exposed to the HPV virus. If you haven't been having sex, I wouldn't worry about it. <br>  <br>  4. No. You're masturbating. Masturbation doesn't get you pregnant. If you're not having sex, then you're not pregnant. If you're not having sex, you don't have diseases. <br>  <br>  If you're that concerned about it, talk to your mom and maybe go to a gynecologist.|`|70o2fl5taa	OK calm down.  If you have never had sex then at least you aren't pregnant.  It is normal for girls to have inconsistent periods when they first start having them.  Some get one perio and then never get it again for a year or so.  Believe me, when you do finally get it regularly you will wish you didn't!  Discharge is also normal as long as it is not green or smelly, like a mucus.  That would indicate an infection.  And humping your pillow... and just about any other type of masturbation, is not going to give you and infection (other than putting things inside you that don't belong there.) Just keep it clean and relax.  It's gonna be OK!|`|z0torDIWaa	1. Well no, its not normal. Even if you are new to it, although it will be irregualr 8 months is quite alot...<br>  2. Discharge is normal between periods, it is just a way for your "V" to clean itslelf out. Unless it starts to smell ot turn green or brown then you do not have to be concerned. If it does tho you could have a yeast infection.<br>  3. I don't know much about cervical cancer but I don't think it would have anything to do with missing your period.<br>  4. Uhmmm, okay. Hahahahah. That's okay to do...it will not affect your period in ANY way. At all.<br>  <br>  I mean you could just be irregular but your best bet it to see a doctor ASAP. Becuase I doubt you have cervical cancer but you could have something else. Talk to your mom, or anyother woman figure in your life and then make an appointment with the doc.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope this helps!|`|Nj4Dbce0aa	if you just started your period..its normal for it to be off track. even for 8 months. and the discharge is usually normal. idk though if your getting pains...<br>  #4 could be reason for the discharge<br>  <br>  just to make sure, i would take a pregnancy test and go to the doctor to check for cancer.

I'm 5'3, so I guess you'd have to add maybe 10 pounds to what my weight would be at a size 7. I'm 120 and size 2, so add say 10 pounds per size, that's 130 in a 4, 140 in a 6. Size 6 and 7 are the same, just 7 is the junior version (dif proportions), so add on that 10 for your height and I'd say 150 pounds.<br>  Now I weigh more for my size than most would (dense bones- literally! As unlikely as it seems, it runs in my family.) So you could say that I "should" actually be 110 or 115 pounds. That brings our total for the average, normal boned person down to 140 or 145 pounds.<br>  And finally all this depends on amount of muscle. A more muscular person could weigh 150 or 160 pounds in a size 7 if they were 5'5, while a very unmuscular person could weigh more like 135 pounds.<br>  As you can see it is very complicated. Congrats, though, on focusing not on the number on the scale but on sizes/ inches. It's proven to be healthier.<br>  Well that was a very roundabout way of saying that a 5'5 person wearing a size 7 would probably weigh about 145 pounds.<br>  I would like to end that babble by saying I of course have no professional expertise and am a 13 year old girl who knows next to nothing about all this, only common sense.<br>  Good luck with your quest to size 7! :)|`|jhbJNPC4aa	Between 111 and 149 pounds would be the healthiest weight for you

U GIVE UR SON HAND JOBS?? OMG!!!!!!|`|AIBKiHm7aa	There are several things that are wrong with this situation. First is obviously the fact that you are sexually stimulating your own flesh and blood.  I understand that it is a concern. However, even after seeking medical attention and learning that your sons condition is not a threat or true medical concern or ailment, you still insisted on "treating" him. Especially at 19 years of age, I am sure he is more than capable of doing this "treatment" all on his own. If it is that big of a concern for him, he would be "treating" himself, instead of literally putting it in your hands.<br>  <br>   I honestly do not know what is worse, the fact that you find that this as an appropriate form of "treatment" because you simply cannot afford a purely cosmetic procedure, or the fact that he allows you to stimulate him in a sexual manner and is okay with it. Do you even realize that this "condition" could make it easier for him to properly pleasure a woman, considering the fact that he could probably hit the G-spot like nobodies business?  <br>  <br>  This is an issue of incest and could easily be reported to the police for further investigation if this information is given to a concerned individual. <br>  <br>  Another thing is the fact that you are a single parent, which is almost making it seem like you are taking advantage of your son for some type of sexual release. It makes me question your psychological state and I think that you are the one who needs to seek treatment from your local counselor or psychologist. If you have insurance, you should be able to contact the company and they can give you a list of clinics that accept their coverage so you can seek help promptly. Please keep in mind, that insurance is not necessary to seek treatment and by law, the therapist must keep all conversations and treatment confidential, no matter how illegal the act is. It may also be a good idea to enroll your son in some therapy as well.<br>  <br>   I don't think you understand the current and future psychological damage and social failure that you are implementing in your son. This is something that he will have to keep secret for the sake of saving both of you from thorough embarassment and scorching judgement. This can affect any type of relationship or friendship in the future and put his well being at risk. Especially since he has been given the impression that it is "appropriate." He could become a sex offender, pedophile or sexual abuser. I pray for any offspring left unattended with you or him.  I think that the only advantage in this case is that he is of legal adult age. Do keep in mind, that down the road, he could decide to press charges against you for basically ruining his life and normal functionality as an individual and that this could be setting up innocent and good hearted people to be victimized by his mental disfunction. My advice is to stop "treating" your son immediately and seek treatment for yourself. Let him address his own issues and concerns. Your son probably already has insecurities, and they don't need to be replaced with more severe issues.|`|Xw6RRbHIaa	I have no idea what to say but i think what your doing can help because when my sister was younger her feet were curved and everyday my grandma would massage them straight and it worked but im not positive that it might work for your son because its a penis so i unoo wait for some more answers  or even go to your doctors and show them the improvement and see what they say, dont take my word on it im only 14|`|feYHoPQaaa	put the middle part over a ledge and jump on the tip.

BNAzjSO1aa	If you used the condom properly and it did not split it is unlikely but not impossible to be pregnant. Did you put it on as soon as you started? because sperm can be leaked out during the early stages of sex. You might just have been sick because of your illness but if you are worried do a pregnancy test in about 3 weeks time if you have not had a period.|`|8a719441d739d9411f7c186796d5fd5aaa	Only if the condom had a hole in it.

73fuqfSyaa	Alright, I know I am not a man but I think it is important that you have female advice. Here it is:<br>  If you have a lot of pubic hair and it bothers you...trim it. If you are wondering because you don't want a girl to be turned off...shave it. Most girls like it clean down there. I know you are a little too young but here's the facts, if a girl is giving head or something, she doesn't want a bunch of smelly pubes in her way and hell one might even get caught in her teeth ( I have heard horror stories ) and most girls shave as well so they would probably prefer skin on skin. But ultimately it is up to you, it is whatever you are comfortable with. There is no point in trying to impress someone if you are not comfortable with it yourself.  Do what you want when you want because your opinion is the one that truly matters. Don't be in a hurry to grow up! Hope this helps!|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	dude, its ur manhood here.  its your pride and glory. start shaving it once you can make braids or somthing. ive never shaved and im 14|`|M63kq3AYaa	Only if you plan on wearing lacy underwear, a skirt and carry a handbag around.|`|tvy2K59haa	Sorry I know I am violating the topic: I am not a male.<br>  <br>  But anyways..

It is about 5 cm. long, and its wall is much thinner than that of the parotid duct.<br>  It begins by numerous branches from the deep surface of the gland, and runs forward between the mylohyoideus, hyoglossus, and genioglossus, then between the sublingual gland and the genioglossus, and opens by a narrow orifice on the summit of a small papilla at the side of the frenulum lingu?.<br>  <br>  It drains saliva from the submandibular glands and sublingual glands to the sublingual caruncle at the base of the tongue.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	Everybody has funky webbing other than the frenulum.

Given that it is used in baking, it also implies safety. Baking soda is sprinkled on the toothbrush, and teeth then cleaned using a gentle, circular motion. Care should still be taken though, especially for people with gum sensitivity. Old wives’ recipes often state that a paste of baking powder, a little salt, and a few drops of white vinegar, works effectively.<br>  <br>  Salt, used exactly as baking soda, is also touted as being a good teeth whitener. However, it might just be its osmosis, dehydrating action that makes teeth appear whiter, since dehydrated teeth look whiter. <br>  <br>  Lemon juice is often used, but it had high acidic levels, so teeth can weaken in the long run. Other natural, fruit options regard rubbing the inside of an orange peel on the teeth. A strawberry cut in half and the inside rubbed on teeth also works. Mashed strawberry can also be applied with a toothbrush. Apple cider vinegar is also said to be effective. Dried orange rind, and walnut bark, is also good.<br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|TSVPV6Nvaa	Hydrogen peroxide is your best bet.  Rinse with it for about one minute.  It won't taste the best and creates a lot of foam, but it's goooood stuff!  It will also take a lot longer than using bleaching products.  I really like Listerine Whitening.  It reminds me a lot of peroxide.  <br>  <br>  Avoid dark sodas, coffees, teas, etc. as well.|`|unas9YBraa	Hydrogen Peroxide and baking soda mixed together whiten your teeth. Make a paste out of it and brush your teeth. Then for a couple of days just use baking soda and water paste mixter. You should see results in a short period of time.

I8lFqyyFaa	The bill from a hospital would be insane, so I wouldn't go there unless there's a problem.  I'd suggest visiting your local planned parenthood.  They don't offer obstetrical care, but you can do an initial prenatal appointment there to verify your pregancy, have a pelvic exam and basic STD testing, get pregnancy advice, etc, and be pointed in the direction of other community resources that might be available to you.  They charge on a sliding scale so you can discuss with them what you're able to pay.  I'd also read up and take charge of my own prenatal care at this point too.  There's not much to visits at this point - the most important thing is your diet, nutrition, exercise, and avoiding drugs and acohol.|`|NNwEuC8paa	Maybe find a clinic, or a hospital, they will just bill you at home.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	You can't, and there's no reason to want to, periods are as good or as bad as you make them so if your periods are difficult it’s time you did something about them. <br>  <br>  You can induce periods, which means to bring them on early or bring them on if they’re late, theoretically the methods used for inducing your periods may help shorten your period once you have it. You can combine different progesterone blocking, uterine contracting and oestrogenic herbs, or try different methods such as having sex or masturbating, this helps as during orgasm a hormone called oxytocin is released which causes uterus contractions, relaxation and increased blood flow from arousal also helps, as too does semen which softens the cervix. Hot baths and massaging the lower abdomen also helps as they promote circulation.  <br>  <br>  You can also use extraction, this is a menstrual option that was popular with feminists in the 1970’s, and it’s essentially the same thing that is used today in abortions, only it’s used to get rid of periods instead. The uterus lining that would normally shed is basically sucked out, without the uterus lining there to shed there is no period – it won’t speed your period up, it’ll get rid of it all together for that month, then you’ll get your period as normal next month. It’s hard to find practitioners willing to do this these days.|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Exercising... it totally works|`|xnrGEJZQaa	birth control pills<br>  stress<br>  over excitement<br>  some times LOTS of excersice im talkin 3-6 hours mate<br>  but before your period if u excersice say and hour u get ur period on the same day or the next day<br>  i got my first period straight after P.E<br>  and got my second period (which im on now) the next day and the day before i had P.E. last lesson! lol<br>  coiinky-dink or wat?|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	It all depends on why you want it gone faster!<br>  <br>  Birth Control can make it go away, but you have to decuss that with a doctor because you have to get a prescription for it.|`|NNwEuC8paa	You just can't.

If you don't think that you can hula hoop, you probably can you just need one that is sized for an adult. The great thing about building your own hula hoop is that you can fill it with water which makes it easier to set in motion or you can weight it down with fishing weights to increase your strength training. Another great thing about it is that you can do it in the comfort of your own home and you can work your stomach while standing. No more crunches on the floor. I just put some music on and it is pretty easy to do it for like an hour. You can do it in front of the tv. Plus it can make you feel more sexy. They are pretty easy to make and the results are really good. Just search on Yahoo "make hula hoop". You can find all of the materials at Lowes or Home Depot and you can decorate them with a variety of colorful tapes.

For the most part, it would be an hourglass figure, but if your hip bones are twice the size of your rib cage, there really isn't anything you can do about it. If you lose the weight and exercise, you will get more of the hourglass figure, but in all honesty, very few people have the "ideal hourglass figure" that you see in all the fashion magazines.

9VciZ2Czaa	I guess anything is possible, but most likely not. If you think you have a life threatening disease like DM, you should really see a physician. Diabetes Mellitus is that the pancreas does not make enough insulin to bring blood sugar down to normal levels. Or the insulin produced doesn't function well. It is a lack of the hormones insulin and glucagon. The amount of fluid that leaves the body has nothing to do with diabetes mellitus. The amount of fluid that leaves the body is related to the amount of fluid taken in the body, by drinking liquid. It is possible to have a genetic predisposition to diabetes mellitus, but it is not a contagious disease. Researchers really don't know why this disease occurs, they have theories but no absolutes. See here<br>  <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/about-diabetes.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetes.org/about-diabetes.j...</a><br>  Your physician will be able to order the appropriate lab tests, and interrupt them. Doing a one time blood sugar stick with another persons  meter isn't going to give you any answers, nor diagnosis. There are more specific tests that look at a longer period of time.

Good for bones and<br>  hair as well.|`|CXwjdUgDaa	eat lean meats and eggs...<br>  also u should be taking whey protein|`|o5HQIKhnaa	Well i assume you want to gain weight in muscle, maybe you want to gain a little fat, i put on weight a little easier than most guys so this has never been an issue to me what i have recommended to buddies of mine who are kinda skinny and want to gain weight is to get at least 1.5 to 2 gram of protein per pound of body weight, if you are lifting weights then this can increase your overall weight, another thing you can do is buy weight gainer protein powder its jam packed full of protein, carbs, and good fat i think the 2 shakes a day serving is like 2500 to 3000 calroies, if you have a GNC near you go ask those guys about the weight gainer protein shakes they may have a little more insight than i do, another thing to do is just KEEP EATING CARBS carbs carbs this will help you increase your body weight, another thing is are you eating 5 small or big meals a day ??? if they are small than that actually helps keep you skinny just keep eating, but you have to eat good nutritious foods, not the fast food that you would think help you gain weight, i hope this helps|`|Wm3GDO9jaa	I'm sure you don't want to gain weight that makes you look heavy, but instead you want to look toned?<br>  <br>  The best way to do that is to eat plenty of protein. In order to gain healthy weight, you're going to need to go to the gym or look up some ways to do muscle building. Muscle will help you gain weight and will not make you look large, unless you go over board. <br>  <br>  I weigh 150 pounds and can honestly say that I think I look good. I am tall and have played sports my whole life. I am toned from lifting so much, but because muscle weighs more than fat, my weight is more. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|POA493NBaa	Well its not really good to eat that much.. But i have a Question when you eat "5" times do you exercise or do alot of moving around after you eat.

Anyways i would just eat as much as you possibly can! And don't do any physical exercise at all! Good Luck! =)
mKaFvU9waa	Stress doen not normally lead to puking blood. If the blood is frothy and comes with cough it could be from the respiratory passages. A chest exam is necesary to find the couse. If it was in vomit and bright red in color it could be from the upper GI Tract. The cause can be determined by Endoscopy. Blood from Stomach and lower GI Tract is more blackish with passage of Malena(Black stools) due to digested blood. Whatever the accompanying symptoms or signs Passing of blood should never be overlooked as something trivial. Check up by a doctor to determine the exact cause is mandatory.

RgEtKVaKaa	So sorry for your pooping problems.  Scary & painful.  It sounds like you have hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids are varicose veins in the rectum - they can be internal and/or external.  It is very important that you learn bowel health.  Lots of water, veggies, fruit, fiber, etc., to keep your stool (poop) soft & regular.  Do you suffer with constipation - hard,infrequent pooping? <br>  Generic Metamucil or Miralax will help.  Stool softeners will be beneficial until you get your bowels regulated.  Good luck to you. <br>  Colonoscopy is not painful - it is done under sedation.  The prep is not so pleasant - you will  be cleaning out your entire system.  Serious problems do not usually present themselves with frank bleeding (bright red blood)<br>  Your symptoms are not typical of cancer.  Usually, polyps do not cause bleeding as you described.  The bleeding usually seen with polyps is occult - meaning not seen with the naked eye.  I am a nurse with more than 25 years experience.  This is not to say that you don't have something serious going on - however, it is not likely. Try not to worry too much.  Your doctor probably won't do a colonoscopy right away.  He/she will check for hemorrhoids & prescribe treatment.  Hang in there.  Let me know what you learn.|`|l1ULKxclaa	Go to the doctor this can be very bad..|`|4YSSurSXaa	Hemorrhoids?  I had something similar happen.  I freaked when I found the toilet full of blood.  I went to the Dr. immediately and it was a tear.  I didn't know I could bleed that much!<br>  Go to the dr anyway and make sure it's not internal.|`|a3f2PqC9aa	Those are symptoms of polyps which could lead to cancer or already be colorectal cancer in your body.  I would suggest seeing a doctor asap.
wPXwC7Ufaa	A hand-made card would be best.  Kids that young enjoy home-made cards.  Obviously you'll want to include nice words, but the majority of the card should probably be nice pictures.<br>  <br>  As for what to write, well, you know your cousin, I do not.  Just write what your heart tells you.<br>  <br>  That was very sweet of you to knit a hat for your sick cousin.  I hope she pulls through  :)|`|HfBLQ4sQaa	you sound sweet.<br>  putting emotion, is hard to do.<br>  Think about it for a while, make it have a sence of humor too.<br>  She's 5 and needs a laugh to pick her spirit up!!<br>  I'll pray  for her!!|`|wPNtVytKaa	I would just say what is in your heart, that God only chooses his strongest for the biggest trials, and that you are praying for their full recovery and strength.

PAvYZJK2aa	it is good and above average size|`|DsPhM1Vjaa	the average size for an adult is 6in...u said u have almost 8in and ur only 14....it seems that you are lying.|`|dkoGI9nfaa	Of Course it is OK.  You have also just proved once again that there is no connection between an erect penis length and a flaccid penis length.  7" to 8" is enormous.  If you can maintain a good erection it will most certainly satisfy a girl.  It however depends what you do with your penis and not just the length that will determines how good you are at satisfying a girl.|`|izGGWskkaa	Mine is the same, and I am 14 as well, so I think it is pretty normal. I'd say that is still pretty big, but I believe your not sh*tting! I have the same size!|`|yz72NmWcaa	yeah thats a great size im 15 and mine is about 10 inches|`|Z4OeKTToaa	if u wanna chat more msg me bk|`|ET6zKRuKaa	Ah I really cannot see how your penis would be 7-8 inches hard at the age of 14 but if it is true, yes it is a great size. I personally think that if it is that big at your age, it probably is still growing and will be huge which may hurt your partner in the future. I am not a doctor or at all knowledgeable of this topic.|`|cCqwugA1aa	Did you like pull on it a lot when you were younger, or did the size all go th length instead of girth. Your girth is what, a centimeter?|`|rC2vLonRaa	that doesnt make any sense it cant be that small when ur not hard and then when ur hard its like huge|`|IDXlEQymaa	It's normal|`|AA11231063	i am guessing that that is a great size!!<br>  have fun.|`|9YM3EtdSaa	yes the minimum you need is 3 inches to satisfy a girl so u will be more dan fine|`|wvZoOS9uaa	yeah i'm 14 but past 8 so nothing wrong with that cuz|`|UBiIQ1wXaa	(sniff...sniff)......is that bull I smell....yeah I think so|`|FAoUUQMCaa	I would say tht is above average|`|BGPkhulLaa	7-8 inches for a 14 year old is HIGHLY unlikely.

You should aim for 225 pounds to be healthy at that height.|`|7UNAvadgaa	No hun, you sound about average, if you want you should go on a site called www.mypyramid.gov and check your BMI (body mass index). that tells you what a healthy weight for your age and height should be<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and remember, its whats in the inside that counts so don't be feeling self conscious about your weight, a lot of it could be muscle and muscle weighs more than fat =]|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	You are NOT fat.

b7y1SCAOaa	NO.<br>  <br>  Cephalosporin antibiotics and penicillins are similar in structure, but only slightly. Some people with a penicillin allergy who are allergic to this specific part of the penicillin molecule can have a cross-allergy to cephalosporins. However, there are other parts of penicillin that can cause allergies, which are not present in cephalosporins.<br>  <br>  In the past, it was previously thought that if somebody was allergic to penicillin, they would have about a 30% risk of being allergic to cephalosporins such as cephalexin. However, after many years of studies, it has been found that the true connection is that only about 2% to 5% of people with a penicillin allergy experience an allergy to cephalosporins.<br>  <br>  The only way to be sure is to have an allergy test, but we now know that the chances of being allergic to a cephalosporin if you have a penicillin allergy are quite low.<br>  <br>  I have recently had an anaphylactic reaction to penicillin (which is the worst type of allergy you can have - the life threatening ones). I had to be tested to see if I was also allergic to cephalosporins, because sometimes I need cephalexin for kidney infections. I was tested, and I am NOT allergic, although I do have a serious allergy to penicillins.<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, NO it is not 100%. It is more like 2 to 5% chance, and may even be less than that. However, doctors are always cautious about it, just because it is always a possibility. The biggest worry is when the patient has had a serious anaphylactic reaction like I did.<br>  <br>  I hope this information helps.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	No it isn't. ther is evidence that there can be a cross sensitivity in some people, but that it does not always occur. I can't take any penicillin or Ceftin but am perfectly fine taking Keflex.|`|rcPnnfmmaa	It appears to be about 10% fact.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rxlist.com/keflex-drug.htm#" rel="nofollow">http://www.rxlist.com/keflex-drug.htm#</a><br>  <br>  However a doctor that lets you take something with a 10% risk of causing a potentially lethal reaction unless you absolutely have to is not a very good doctor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalosporin" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalospor...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_rou...</a>

QqFPNti4aa	There are a lot of testimonies about people losing weight from Mona Vie  the majority of them say it is due to the extra energy that they feel.  There is no site that actually has testimonies on it except the official mona vie site and any forums about Mona Vie that you might find by googling.  As for it being healthy for you it is, so have a drink to your health and see where it takes you.|`|oi0eamukaa	MonaVie is very good for you but it will not make you lose weight. It has helped me with energy and clarity. Any weight loss is due to carb cravings being less and me having more energy.
ajBh55Tyaa	Maureen with regards to portion size if you feel full that's all that matters! The only thing you may want to change/consider is substituting peanut butter with almond butter as almond butter is really good for you. <br>  <br>  P.S. keep the skin/peel on the potato when you eat it.|`|AA10847265	You need to be eating meat, vegetables and a little fruit.  Grains are all highly inflammatory and not at all good for you.  You do not need any grains in your diet.  If you want to lose weight limit the amount of fruit you consume.  You will be very healthy and have good muscle tone if you stick to this.  Peanuts are high in Omega 6 fatty acids which are very inflammatory so I would skip the PB & J.|`|HaNMN21Paa	You're on the right track, but I would add some veggies to dinner and as a snack (carrot sticks, etc.). Also, it doesn't look like you're getting enough calcium, so milk, yogurt, etc. I suggest a multi-vitamin, too.|`|tluT02tvaa	That all sounds great.And peanut butter is wonderful to get a good protein fix.Good choice of bread,is the Jelly low sugar? it should be.<br>  You have a great amount of good carbs,protein and fruit.keep it up :)|`|AA11835015	if you are not hungry or STARVING, it is not too little. jelly is sugar, needed for energy, and fruit rendings (juice, basically). do you think you could make your own?? it is better than store-bought...<br>  peanuts, especially p-nut butter from a natural jar is not bad. i can almost eat it. the others have sugar and salt and are nasty! what kind of bread you eat it on too, is a concern. american white bread is not so grand. consider making your own there, also. i have a bread machine in usa, but while in russia, my wife makes rolls etc, by hand. as far as kasha (russian word for porridge) also try buckwheat. it is sold in health food stores, usually, and can be eaten with sweet additions as oatmeal is usually sweetened. oatmeal, or with meat as is rice. buckwheat is i think, 17% protein, quite high for a vegetable source.<br>  i an a fruit-a-holic (addicted to fruitahol!) i would add a ton of apples, 1/2 ton peach and all the berries i could find. (over)eat cabbage, too. and all vegetables you like. (you can't overeat good vegetables!! :) )<br>  my rule: eat foods as near to the way the Good Lord made them. unprocessed. and remember- the scale may lie to you. if you add pounds, it can be from losing fat but gaining heavier muscle. so don't starve yourself into failure.<br>  good luck!!

72t32mzKaa	ER is for people who are really sick.<br>  Go to your local pharmacy and get some proper migrain pills - migraleave is the best thing. If you dont have that where ever you are from then ask your pharmasict whats the best thing for it. if they come on darken the room, cold face cloth on your head and no noise.<br>  If your migraines persist make an appointment with your doctor. If you go to the er with this you will be stopping people who need urgent medical help.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	This is what my daughters and I use for migraines you can get it at the nearest drug store you don't have to go to the ER.  Go to the nearest drug store and get a bottle of Excedrin they are made of 250 mgs of aspirin and 250mgs of acetaminophen and about 50 mgs of caffeine.  You don't have to get the one that says it's for headaches they have the same amount of medicine in them.  Or look for the store version.  After you take two go into a cool dark room and lay down.  It should help your headache.  IF you don't get rid of your headache in about three hours take another two tablets.  But for the most part the Excedrin should work.  Than if you get a lot of headaches talk to your doctor about going to a neurologist to get some preventive medications.  This is how I've dealt with migraines for the past 40+ years.|`|isnHOG0Waa	Nothing. Sorry. <br>  <br>  I have Migraines all the time. Its healthy for my body.

rDl9XR76aa	I'm in the army. Before I went to basic training, I could do a couple. But the first 3 weeks of Basic training, they totally break your muscles down to where you can't even walk without wanting to cry.<br>  <br>  So after I got to basic training, I couldn't do push-ups until I was in AIT (like 9 weeks later).. <br>  <br>  So what I did on my own time when drill sgts weren't up our asses.. I would get into the pushup position and just hold it for 60 seconds. Then I'd rest for about 15 seconds, then I'd do another 60. I repeated it about 5-10 (depending on how much free time I had) a night. Then I would put my knees down and into the "girl" push-up position.. I would go down like I was actually doing a push-up and just hold it, with my elbows bent slightly further than a 90 degree angle and I would hold it for 60 seconds, then 15 second break, then 60 again... <br>  <br>  But my thing here was teaching myself to keep my whole body straight while I did it, so that way when we had a PT test I knew they would count. Which means, your butt isn't sagging or sticking up in the air. <br>  <br>  Do yours in front of a mirror to "train" your body into the correct form.. So when your doing them without a mirror, you can just knock them out.<br>  <br>  Anyway... So day 1 at Basic Training... I could do less than 5.. Then I could do zero for whole time during training.. Phase 5 (20 weeks in) PT test so we could graduate and come home, I knocked out 49 push-ups, and I only needed 17 to pass.|`|fSzEGjUlaa	yup. everyone is suppsed to be able to do one. <br>  <br>  lol. if you are determined enough, then you can do it!!! i know many high schoolers that don't know, but it's embarassing--stay determined: <br>  <br>  cause when you wave, that fat on the bottom--yea. you don't do pushups. it's called working out your tricepts.

ZzAxCBy4aa	Ok, First off you are much shorter then I am. I too am also 13 and i am like 5.7 or something! I hate being the tallest in my class to. I know that eventually everyone in my class will catch up... i also wanted to know how to stop my body from growing(height wise). I found out that Coffee stunts your growth! But i don't want to start drinking coffee and its a nasty habbet anyways!  So i finally came to a conclusion that I should just be happy with my height, and everyone will soon catch up to me! Im not a freak for being tall and neither are you! So be happy with your height for now!|`|ecLVTXKUaa	Don't worry so much about how u are growing right now.  When I was in middle school there were some very tall girls and these girls turned out to be average height in highschool.<br>  <br>  Your body doesn't grow at the same speed throughout every year.<br>  Some years are different.<br>  I stopped growing when I was 13 or 14 years old.  I am 4'11 and I'm in my 20's.<br>  <br>  Be happy with how you are it is what makes you special.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	You are at a good height according to your genetics.

LfLJtSTxaa	There's nothing you can really do to *shorten* the time you'll have to wear them, but you can take steps to avoid lengthening the time you'll have to wear them.<br>  <br>  Always wear your elastics - always. Take them off to eat and brush your teeth but put new ones in immediately after. Don't wear them for longer than about 8 hours - you should eat more often than that anyway, so just replace them whenever you eat. They lose their elasticity, and thus their effectiveness, after that time, and if you need more they should be available at the orthodontist's office. Mine personally has several little baggies of elastics taped to the window outside, so even if the office is closed you can run up there and get more. They should also give you another little baggie or two at every tightening - ask if they don't do it automatically. Mine does, anyway.<br>  <br>  Do NOT try to put two elastics on the same hooks in an attempt to double the speed at which your teeth are being moved. You WILL over-correct and you WILL actually have to wear the braces longer.<br>  <br>  Also remember, your orthodontist is not clairvoyant. He cannot predict the future exactly, so if things are progressing more slowly or more quickly than he initially thought, the length of time you'll have to wear the braces will change.
AA11295695	An answer is really dependent on a lot of different factors.<br>  <br>  1. What type of health insurance you have.<br>  2. If you have (or have not) met your deductible for the year.<br>  3. The radiology facility will have its own price according to what type of MRI you need to have and if you need contrast or if you require IV sedation or if it is an open or closed MRI.<br>  <br>  But first, you need to see a doctor to check you out.  You'll probably have to have a physical exam and a pelvic exam.  CT, xrays and the MRI are possible tests as well as blood tests and urine analysis.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Ejc2WxcRaa	Like in your situation,I would like to advise you have a look here <a href="http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...</a>|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	First another physician would have to order the MRI and state the reason it is deemed necessary.  Then you should contact the number on the back of your insurance card and explain that you are having the test and they can advise you as to how much you will have to pay.  Depending on where you live, without insurance, it could cost $2000.<br>  <br>  good luck..
nr5VfSguaa	Add more fruit and veggies in your diet. Instead of long moderate cardio try short intense circuits and weights. Other than that you're fine.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	You ate a lot of packaged foods. You should eat whole, fresh foods. <br>  Fresh meats, vegetables, and fruits. <br>  <br>  Special K, vegemite, spaghetti, toast, custard tart are no good, they are all processed and packaged. Also bread and spaghetti are empty carbs. You need more protein: organic chicken, free range beef, organic eggs, wild salmon.
rHqe7oMoaa	If it's true that he doesn't have the hockey tournament, then yes, he's blowing you off. Maybe he has better things to do? Maybe he feels he has outgrown you or fallen in with a different type of friend?<br>  <br>  Perhaps he did not want to offend you, and that is why he made up the hockey thing? What most people say online (ie. "oh that'd be great!" etc..) is not necessarily what they'd say/do in real life.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I think he doesn't want to hang out with you (I could be wrong though). <br>  <br>  Chin up! Plenty more fish in the ocean and all that! :)|`|zfD0NX5oaa	maybe he thinks you have a crush on him. chill, and make other friends. obviously he''s being an *** and doesn't want to "hang" with you. so make other friends.|`|XjSr6phSaa	Yeah it seems that he doesnt really want to see you and he doesnt have enoght ***** to tell you so, just get new friends, and ditch him, ppl that cant be honest is not worth to waist time with|`|v7MGxOGUaa	well, he might accually have hockey. because one of my brothers has states this weekend and my other brother has states next weekend.<br>  but still, dont act desperate.
F1igZsMXaa	flexed arm hang will increase static strength, meaning just the muscles worked in that fixed position. what you need to do is increase the strength in your lats. instead of pull ups try a pull down machine, works the same muscles as a pull up, but youll be able to gradually increase the strength in these muscles.|`|g2xlxZEZaa	do curls and bench presses and if u have access 2 a lat pull machine it will help alot|`|3nyoCTBxaa	Yes, actually that will help lots!

cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	When you lit weights, you break down the muscle tissue, when you rest it, it grows back stronger.  The importance of your rest day depends on the intensity of your workouts.  If you're going at it hard, you never give them a chance to re-build.  If faster results are what you want, alternate muscle groups daily, giving them time to rest.|`|SJunThLBaa	If you lift every day your wasting your time this is because when you lift your actually tearing your muscles which create spaces for proteins to fill then resulting in bigger muscles overtime and if you dont give your self a break those muscles are already torn open which wont result in bigger muscles they will stay the same.
B7fS9hWOaa	Yeah I took Lipo 6 before. I liked it. I lost about 10 pounds from that mixed with diet and working out.<br>  <br>  The lipo 6x is better though.|`|kmOx8Hu6aa	Cabbage soup diet!!! Oh my gosh... please dont waste your time with fad diets, they dont work! If they did, why are so many people overweight???<br>  <br>  Just eat sensibly, and I know you know what that is! Eat 3 meals and 2 snacks a day. Include lean protein, whole wheat carbs, vegetables, fruit and healthy fats.... <br>  <br>  Exercise!<br>  <br>  Lipo 6 doesnt work the way you think it does- the ads in those magazines arent REAL! Like sure the women dieted and did cardio- but I dont think  you understand the extent these women go to get in that type of shape (I know because Im one of them!) We will do up to 3 hours a day of cardio, train with weights 5-6 days a week, eat a restricted diet (not cabbage soup or any other fad diet) and we do this for up to 20 weeks! The women in those magazines dont look like that year round- its IMPOSSIBLE to maintain that physique, its not healthy! They look like that for a few months, for contests and photo shoots and then gain their 'off season' weight....<br>  <br>  Ive used Lipo 6 along with a million other diet drugs, and no, they dont work
tBZ2BbuEaa	I heard that the average person will have the majority of their acne until the age of 20. I dont think it matters when you started having acne.|`|M2I0BNQUaa	No, the earlier you get it does not mean the earlier it will go away, it means you have bad skin and will most likely have it into your twenty's, I'm sorry, but people are not given a acne time limit in which they are miserable and then the mask comes off leaving them thin and beautiful, but I seriously wish that's what would happen.
twuEvpiVaa	that happens to me too, sometimes I just get pains like that randomly..I dont really know what it is so I just ignore it. of course it's not a heart attack you would definitely know if it was.. 8-10 hours of sleep is really good, you're lucky I barely get any sleep lol. but if the pain keeps bothering you or if you're worried, you can tell your parents or just ask next time you go to the doctor|`|uDsk8s4qaa	u should go to ur next dr appt and tell the doc about it. i had that prob for a while, it comes and goes. u also wouldnt have a heart attack cuz ur young. u will no if you do. i have heard from old ppls that it feels like someone is ripping your chest apart.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	8 hours of sleep is the recommended amount..<br>  and definitely not heart attack.<br>  <br>  just go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  might be something worth going to the doctor about.

02d0dbba77861d90576aef0958f8bca9aa	I don't think that being African American would necessitate using a different kind of sunblock.  If anything, you have more melanin, so you have better protection against the harmful effect of the sun's rays.  If you don't want to tan, use a high level of SPF.  I believe the highest available is SPF 90.  But anything beyond 15 or 30 would normally prevent tanning.
Oe3zFzRlaa	you can put it back right where it was and don't even say anything about it. and if she does ask about say "eww.... you have a vibrator? that's gross? and why would i even use it after you? <br>  <br>  or, you can can put it in between the drawers and make it look like it got broken from being jammed between two drawers. <br>  <br>  this might be a good time to ask her about sex, and maybe ask for a vibe of your own. my dad's given me a magazine or two, and it's ok to masturbate and to be curious|`|IkHTD61Gaa	just put it back and say you did npothing :P|`|V6GI0m8Caa	hahahaha! f*ck masturbation and go get some spelling lessons darlin.<br>  but yeah i suggest you put in back in the drawer, in the same position - surely she will just assume she did it last time, and wouldn't even think to ask if her DAUGHTER used her vibrator. <br>  <br>  this sh*t is wrong.|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	well, don't tell her because she'll be totally freaked out and disgusted that you used her vibrator.<br>  <br>  If you can't fix it, just place it in EXACTLY the same spot you found it in and just make her think that she broke it the last time she used it and didn't realize it.<br>  <br>  And if she asks you about it, look her straight in the eye and lie.|`|cWenZqsfaa	well hopefully she doesnt know you know she has a vibe cuz thats honestly kinda wierd - sorry but it is - so just put it back exactly where you got it from.. in the exactly same way and all... and hope she thinks she did it.. and just act dumb.. not really dumb.. but enough that you can honestly pull off you dont know what shes talking about|`|eMPeOsRBaa	just pretend that you don't know anything. if she asks you about it then just be like 'WHAT?! you have a vibrator? eww!!'<br>  or, if she knows that you know then say "Gross.

I do it because I like the feel and also the way it looks, neater and sexier.|`|M0YFa6Tmaa	Both, for these reasons:<br>  We figure women like it better trimmed or clean-shaven. Also, it's a lot more comfortable, and it doesn't feel like it's getting in the way. And it makes the junk look bigger too.

9OyIL8P9aa	Yes you are right, some of these sound like low iron, but they also sound like it could be a thyroid problem as well. <br>  I would get to the doctor and they will do a blood test to see if it is your iron or not. I had a blood test done to find out about my iron because I was passing out, no energy,sleeping problems, and not wanting to eat. If it is iron problems there are iron pills that you can take, make sure they are taken with orange juice,helps it get into the blood faster. <br>  But best bet is to get to the doctor and get tested out to see what it is.|`|AlM5xtc4aa	Ok. so i'm your have low iron because your tired, brittle nails  and headaches.

biMINS1Eaa	well your body doesn't get enough food so it stores all the fat and eventually you will lose weight, but not healthy or permanently.  Eat healthy and exercise if you want to lose weight permanently and in a healthy manner|`|YLQpcjQPaa	that's not too healthy. eat 4-6 several very small meals a day every 2 hours.|`|OP8sRCbTaa	Eating only once a day is very unhealthy.  When you eat less, your body slows down its metabolism, and it will eat away at your muscles before your body fat.  Not eating doesn't really make you lose weight as much as it makes you unhealthy and weak.  If you're looking to lose some weight, try simply eating healthier and exercising.  Running can help to increase your metabolism so you can burn off calories quicker.  If you have a serious eating disorder though you should talk to someone you trust and get help before things get worse.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  *If you're just 'not hungry', eat smaller meals more frequently anyways.  It will likely trigger hunger and keep you from becoming unhealthy.|`|0KDOSIJPaa	if you only eat one meal a day that meal will turn into fat instead of burning off you will lose little to no weight and you will be constantly hungry even if you dont realize it yet and if you keep it up you might pass out. SO EAT MORE. just eat healthy|`|u4xecGynaa	eating one meal a day isn't healthy. You will get headaches and stomachaches. it's best if you eat normal healthy meals and exercise daily

zGPaH7tjaa	Interestingly, just for you I have made a blog on how to lose weight. It tells you when to drink water and between what meals and how much. Don't bother with pills. Follow my diet plan that I have made and combine it with some weight loss programs I have reviewed and you will have a killer diet plan and you will reach 100 pounds lose in about a quarter of that time!! Visit my blog in my source.|`|eKDYbe9Laa	walking|`|99Znmg81aa	Try a website like sparkpeople.com.  They have info on what your calorie intake ranges should be, and how many calories you need to burn doing exercises.  They will suggest exercises you should try.<br>  <br>  In addition to the walking, you should do some resistance exercises (either at a gym, or home exercises) in order to build up some muscle.  More muscle means that you're burning more calories even when you're not being active, and you'll need that to lose that much weight.|`|pQbYaNf2aa	Kudos to you for doing this! <br>  <br>  I find that I lose weight quicker when I cut back on carbs. I limit my rice and bread. Someone has told me that great abs are made in the kitchen. Eat 6 small meals a day. Keep a journal of what you eat. Do not eat 3 hours before sleeping. It is hard at first but your body will just get used to it.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend you taking pills specially at your age. You are young and your body can lose weight fast if you stay active. Join a dance class or buy a dance video to watch and follow at home. Add variety to your exercise.<br>  <br>  Food and exercise go hand in hand. <br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join.

L0jKFBHWaa	umm obviously the other people on here dont know what the heck binge eating is. Anyways, at first i started to not eat anything and then binge after school. Now this is what i do, i eat breakfast, which lasts me until lunch, and i eat yogurt, then after school, i eat saltine crackers, and by dinner, im not really hungry. I try to do things that distract me from eating, like keeping myself busy with school work, soccer, cheerleading, ice skating, hanging out with friends, and exercising. If i know im gonna have to be home after school, i make plans. And usually it keeps me from eating. I know once i start eating after school, its extremely hard to stop, so i just try not to start. Well good luck =]|`|v721s9KKaa	Im getting tired of the diet answers always trying to sell something! From experience what I have found is that the only way to break this habit is to replace it with another habit that you really like, but is not going to affect your health negatively. Then, when you get home instead of getting food, let yourself do the other thing. Maybe you like to play sport, go swimming, go to the library, go shopping, go see friends, I don't know. There will be something for you. Maybe you want to do something towards a job you would like to have. The point is, after time you wont let yourself be in the situation where you are home and bored and in the habit of eating at that time.
AA10450066	It sounds like you're dealing with allot of stress going through this particular break up.You must have had deep feelings for this person. With what you're describing you'd need to say how long you've been feeling this way.It may just be the fact that you still need time to deal and your body is showing it in physical manifestations. If it's not a radiating pain then I wouldn't worry too much, but if it's been going on for more than a couple of days you need to get it checked out. Stress can do a real number on people.Especially woman. Our hormones get us into more problems then we're aware of sometimes. I hope you can get over this person soon.I'm not going to say that they weren't worth it because no one else knows exactly what that person meant to you.|`|uXO8X565aa	when one is sad or feels like crying ,his or her chest muscles are worked up which results in pain.This pain is normally mistaken for heart pain.The stabbing in chest/heart could be due to gas or acidity.|`|6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	Being sad HURTS.

7zBbm8C8aa	impingement syndrome
oMIHruTtaa	I was on the pill for 11 years from teenage years to regulate my period.  When I came off, it hadn't corrected itself.  I don't think the pill can actually correct it.  I have a bit of a problem with my ovaries though so that probably caused the irregular periods.  Its called polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is a common cause of irregular periods.  Hope this helps in some way!|`|kprKXEOSaa	I'm not a doctor, I'm just talking from personal experience here.<br>  <br>  This makes me really angry.  Doctors prescribe the pill for just about every female ill, and it doesn't solve any problem, it only masks symptoms and gives you different symptoms.  The pill is artificial hormones, and it basically shuts down the female reproductive system.  <br>  <br>  I went on the pill briefly when I was about 21, to regulate my period.  It really made me moody, I mean I was a mess.  I decided I'd rather have irregular periods than be a mess, and went off them.<br>  <br>  About 5 years later, I went on the pill (a different kind, thinking it would be better that time) when I got married.  I was on it for about 9 months, and was a mess again, really depressed to the point I thought I was going crazy.  (My poor husband!)  The pharmacist told me that you have to take a multi-vitamin when your'e on the pill.  I started taking one, and immediately my mood improved.  I thought--"problem solved" until the problem gradually came back, despite taking vitamins.<br>  <br>  About that time, we decided we'd like to have a baby, so I went off the pill, and guess what?  No periods.  For a year.<br>  <br>  If your periods are irregular, you basically have a hormone problem.  Taking the pill will not fix it, it will only mask that symptom, and give you new symptoms.  If only I had known then what I know now!  I would never recommend a woman or girl use hormonal birth control, for any reason, and especially not to regulate her period.  This goes for all period problems, whether it be heavy bleeding, moodiness, severe PMS, lack of periods, or whatever.  The pill will not fix the problem.<br>  <br>  I researched and used a wild yam cream.  It basically absorbs through the skin and your body uses the natural chemicals from the wild yam to make hormones.  The brand I use is called Syringa, you can find them online, or there are many other brands, just make sure you get a good quality cream if you decide to try it.  At first I would use it 5 or 6 times a day, every day.  As my cycles returned and normalized, I used it 3 or 4 times a day, and only when I wasn't menstruating.  When I got pregnant, I continued using it.  <br>  <br>  I believe you really have to educate yourself about a lot of these things, because the medical community just has their typical things they prescribe, and often they don't fix the problem, it can actually make it worse in the long run.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
DI3u9gMSaa	Expect your teeth to look good with clear braces on top.  Expect food to get stuck in your brackets and using your tongue to constantly fish out the food.  Expect a hard time flossing.  Expect your inside lips to be irritated or occasionally cut up.<br>  <br>  My teeth hurt so badly the first several days I had them on, but the pain greatly lessened after that.  Don't even try eating hard stuff in the beginning.  I had trouble eating pizza, sandwiches with hard bread, and chips.  But only for the first several days.  <br>  <br>  Avoid eating hard food, stick food, food with lots of sugar.  Hard foods can bend wires and break brackets.  I sometimes eat hard food but I make sure to eat carefully.  Sticky foods can pull the cement loose and bend wires.  Sugary foods can cause tooth decay.  Sure, I eat ice cream and junk food but I brush immediately after.<br>  <br>  I just brush my clear braces normally like I would without braces.  Spend time brushing your teeth.  Braces are an expensive investment.  <br>  <br>  I love having braces because my teeth started out really crooked and it pleasures me to know that they are going to make my teeth straight.  I started out with Invisalign for the looks but switched - clear braces look fine on me.  Plus, I'm a nerd so these braces look good on me.  Check out pictures (below) of the braces on my teeth.|`|mGJpWBpdaa	First, you should expect some pressure the first day, through the first week. Take some pain killer pills if they hurt. You can eat soft foods, for your own good, you don't have to, but you might want to for the first two weeks. Clear on the top and metal on the bottom won't look good. You should get clear on the bottom. Cleaning clear ones is not going to be faster or slower than metal ones. I don't have braces, but  my sister does, but i am getting them in April! You should be excited! To tell you the truth, i am actually looking forward to the pain! :)|`|uq0d0wkCaa	you should expect your teeth to hurt for like a week to maybe two  because they have something on them pushing on them braces are fun to have i guess sometimes they suck but that is expected but it will feel so cool when you get them off but you will kinda miss them make sure you don't eat and thing too hard cause then you will break a bracket hope that helps ...good luck!!|`|qaWtwRGpaa	TRUST ME! if u had spacers they feel like that but on ur front teeth for the first 3 days then they just feels wierd.. um u get used to them in like 5 days! they still cut my mouth and ive had them for 2 months already... jsut beacuase the wires become more distict because my teeth moved SOOOO FRIKIN FAST!!!!! ummm all i have to say is brush ur teeth really really well and eat ALOT! because the first week all u can eat is like pudding and yogurt.... although i liked that cause i love pudding and yogurt!<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and its gunna be weird eating food for a while.. it feels a lil uncomfy still.. and gum get stuck on them.... but its easy to get out without anyone noticing at school lol<br>  <br>  good luck! hope u enjoy them! i love editing the colours!|`|J62umtpDaa	For the first couple of weeks (maybe a couple of months depending on how bad your teeth are) your teeth will ache.  During that time I suggest eating anything soft: yogurt, jello, soup...  Also, anything you can tear into small pieces is usually ok to eat, since the molars tend to hurt much less than the other ones.<br>  <br>  After you adjust to your braces, you can't chew anything sticky (soft candy, gum, don't chew hard candy), don't eat popcorn or anything that might scrape the braces off your teeth either.  Don't eat things like whole apples, cut them up before you eat them.  Your dentist can give you a full list of stuff if you ask.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to clean the clear braces is to brush your teeth.  Carry a travel tooth brush in your pocket, and after a meal just take a few seconds to brush it off, you don't need toothpaste to just get the stuff out from under the braces.<br>  <br>  You'll want to carry the wax they give you around with you for the first couple of months at least.  Usually braces will be stabbing and scraping the insides of your mouth for a little while, wax helps prevent that.  And no, while i like that braces will make my teeth straight, i can't wait to get them off.<br>  <br>  Lastly, once you get them off, wear your retainer.  Otherwise your teeth could shift again later.
vycAqfkiaa	Yes. Stop worrying about it coming. Just bring lots of pads, tampons, underwear, pantiliners, thong pads, midol, advil, and whatever else you need to make yourself comfortable. By being prepared and not worrying about it coming your mind may delay the signal to start flow. Stop worrying your a woman, it comes with the territory, and can often be a great excuse. If your sharing a room, just lock the door when in the bathroom, and take your time to make sure your secure enough to be active and running around. If that means wearing a tamp and a pad, then so be it. Flush the tampons, and wrap pads well, and then again in tissue so that the guys don't suspect anything.|`|fSzEGjUlaa	lol. it's bad if it comes late, though it's okay. <br>  <br>  stress, and lack of sleep, food, nutrients, ect. makes it come later, though that's bad--meaning your body isn't healthy enough to become pregnant--look up how your period works. <br>  <br>  i hope it helps!!! <br>  <br>  but if you have acne, then use salysalic acid/benzoyl peroxide--drugstore face wash. just use it 3x a day... clearasil, neutrogena, clinique (macy's)<br>  use tampons--no messy pads.<br>  <br>  the pill also helps--4 periods every year.|`|wPXwC7Ufaa	probably not.<br>  <br>  p.s. if you have a medical condition that makes your period irregular, heavy, painful, etc (doesn't sound like you do, though) you can get on B.C. to regulate it regardless of your age.

DSzG23WRaa	Any discharge from nipples when there is not a baby involved should be seen by a dr. Unless you are breastfeeding, I would go asap. Good luck.|`|AA10450066	Since you're 18 you really aren't going to grow anymore. I'm not sure why your mom doesn't know that,but at 18 you should go to the doctor anyway and have your first pap smear and mammogram so that there's a baseline reading on file. That way if everything turns out to be alright with the discharge you're having there's a normal record for the doctor to refer to in case you do have something go wrong a littler later. You should have a physical with other readings.Most people in the late teens and early twenty's think they are so young that they skip this and then surprise,they find out 5 years too late that there was something that would've been caught if only they would have done this.You already are an adult, so please do this as an adult should.No lecture, just fact.|`|LRJmHA7vaa	You need to have a mammogram.

I still use the moisturizer but have been using the DOVE BAR for sensitive skin and I like it better.  I am also on minocycline- an anti-biotic.

I also use Tazorac cream at night- it is not indicated for acne but for psoriasis my dermatologist said they see results for acne too.

Whichever Diet product you're drinking, check the nutrition facts first. Keep track of how much calories you are consuming each day if you're concerned about gaining weight.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	That is a common size and you should be able to purchase it anywhere bras are sold.  In case you are not sure of your new size, here is how to properly measure:<br>  <br>  Here is the way to measure for a bra size.  Take a tape measure and go under the arms and around the back to the chest, comfortable, and write down that number, lets say 34".  Then take the tape measure and go around the back at the fullest part of the breast, lets say 37" and write that down.  Now you subtract the first number from the second, or three inches.  For each inch difference, you add one cup size, so this person would wear a 34C; thirty-four for the size and up three sizes (a,b,c) for the three inches or a C.<br>  <br>  hope this helps..|`|6aa0f7105f19c51829e4f53b2559887eaa	You need to go to a store and ask one of the ladies there to measure you. Bras are kinda funny in sizing-- if a 36b is too small, 38b is not necessarily the right next size. If you go ask them, they can help you, and it won't be a big deal at all.<br>  <br>  edited to add-- if you're REALLY against it (it's not a problem-- you leave your shirt on.) Then here's how you can guess.<br>  <br>  If a 36b is too small around, but the cup its correct, your actual size is a 38a. They are inversely proportional. So the cup of a 38A is the same as 36B is the same as 34C. See what I mean? And the cup fits correctly if it doesn't dig in and you don't overflow, and the band is correct if you can JUST slide two fingers under the band on its LOOSEST hooks. (you tighten the hooks as the bra gets older and stretches.)
Zt6eh6VRaa	Having suffered from acne myself, i can tell you that usually the prespcriptions from dermatologists, not only do not come with specific instructions, but fail to work consistently because of their harsh nature....here's what you can have her begin with to start seeing some clarity....<br>  For a start, you can get some Neutrogena On the Spot benzoyl peroxide and start of veeery slowly with it. Just wear it for 15 minutes a day, but make sure she wears it all over the face. Then double the wearing time every three days. Then, when you are up to wearing it for 3 hours for 3 days in a row, then start wearing it overnight. You need to wear benzoyl everyday in order for it to work and not just "on the spot" but all over. It prevents the acne from forming in the first place.<br>  <br>  That will help your acne alot, but it usually takes more than that to get clear. <br>  <br>  For free information about:<br>  <br>  1.

I do not have bad acne  only the occasional pimple here (im 18) and there so i don't know if it works the way they say it works. Also not sure if you can by it over the counter, you can certainly ask and shop around for it. But to keep my face fresh and pretty much pimple free i just use an exfoliation scrub designed for your face - removes dead skin cells and cleans your pores, than i apply a facial cream from Loreal (Don't know if thats how its spelt but Its used for sensitive skin because i seem to have sensitive facial skin only!!) and it seems to keep my face free of pimples until the week before "that week" i may get one our 2 pimples. I also do not wear make-up on a daily basis and when i do its as light as can be so i avoid a few acne problems from not clogging my pores which seems to send peoples faces into acne over drive.. <br>  <br>  But i would consider trying and looking for Pro-Active

AA11693263	BV is not a STD. In fact you can get it without ever have had sex before. It's caused by a disruption of the normal bacteria that is always present. You can get if from taking baths, certain soaps, laundry detergent, fabric softener, and other things that can throw off the Ph balance. It is treated with an antibiotic that you can take in pill form or there is a gel that you use for 5 days that is inserted the same way yeast infection medication is. The antibiotic that is used is one that makes you violently sick if you drink any amount of alcohol while you are taking it so avoid drinking while on it. Don't even use mouth wash as that contains alcohol and just swallowing a little can make you sick. Make sure you finish all of the medication so that you are certain to clear up the infection. And men cannot get BV. You should refrain from intercourse until you are finished with the medication. Some women can get it from intercourse and from certain brands of condoms as well.|`|rmHDABOzaa	In order to determine whether you have BV or a yeast infection, your doctor will take a sample for a pH and possibly a culture. This is the best way to tell. It may take a couple of days to diagnose, but your doctor will likely send you home with some form of treatment. <br>  <br>  BV typically occurs because of changes in the pH levels in the vagina. Sometimes it is because of sex or because of a period. When the pH is to basic (high) good bacteria do not survive well enough to kill bad bacteria. <br>  <br>  You may also have a yeast infection. Some woman experience a yeast infection that has no discharge, but rather a white coating on the vulva. Some woman experience BV and have no odor. It is best to see your doctor and be tested. <br>  <br>  If you experience this chronically, I recommend Yeast Arrest. It is an insertable capsule that will help to regulate your pH and keep bad bacteria at bay.|`|PImvmP1paa	Okay. <br>  <br>  If you or your doctor thinks you have Bacterial Vaginosis, then he will put the speculum up there and bring some discharge out on it. He will look at it. He will put it in a sterile container and send it off to the lab. My doctor called it an Affirm test. Normally it will take 3 days to get results back. <br>  <br>  Bacterial Vaginosis is not an STD. It is a Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI). It's not exactly proven how one can get Bacterial Vaginosis. It is more common in women who are sexually active. All that is know is sexual activity and semen increase the pH balance in the vagina. The increase of vaginal pH can increase the growth of "bad" vaginal bacteria in the vagina, which in turn the "good" vaginal bacteria may be out numbered and cause an infection.<br>  <br>  Even if you've only had one sex partner, you can still get it.  <br>  <br>  You can go to this website. I understood it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_vaginosis/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/bacterial_vag...</a>|`|RKTNDLDKaa	A friend had this.    My understanding is that it's caused from bacteria or other agents that don't interact well with your body's chemistry.     My friend was told that she should avoid intercourse with her husband until after he'd showered because the sweat and dirt from the day would cause her BV.   (he works construction).       The doc also told her to not take a bath because the dirt/soap can float into the vagina.  Wear cotton underwear and avoid a thong or g-string because they can transfer bacteria from the rectal area to the vaginal area.  <br>  <br>  The doctor did a test in the office and had the results immediately.     She got a prescription for some cream to use daily, internally.      The medicine for a yeast infection IS NOT the same as the medicine for BV.    <br>  <br>  No, it's not an STD at all.|`|OnDIrxNEaa	Ugh, I've had it more times than I care to count, beginning when I was 16 and still very much a virgin.  Everyone else is right on, it is not an STD, men can't catch it (damn them!), and the results come right away.  I am always prescribed Flagyl (metronidazole) and have to take it 2x a day for 7 days.|`|lAQRpH2Iaa	I have this right now too and have tried every medication to cure it and it didn't work so the next step for me is surgery but this is rare. The medication should work right away but make sure you go back if it doesn't.|`|GFS30K0Eaa	The Dr. will get a sample of the discharge by doing something like a pap smear. You will then know right there!  Its not an STD and its no concrete explantion of how you get one. Dr.s have said anything from tight clothes to the soap you use. Ive had more than enough! You will be prescribe Flagyll which is an antibiotic  you take for 10 days I believe 2x a day. The nastiest pill you will ever take. Or you may get the vaginal cream. The last time I tried some other remedies I saw on the internet, which was taking probiotics capsules orally and inserting one at night vaginally. It actually worked cuz by the time I got to the Dr. it was barely there.
rHqe7oMoaa	Tell her that you don't like pads (and give reasons why) and ask what else you can use. Then you can avoid coming straight out with "I want to use tampons!".

GaRMkddiaa	For my stretch marks, I use BioOil. You might think its a bit pricey for the size you get, but really, you only need one or two drops of it to cover a lot of skin area. It won't remove the stretch marks that are already white, but if you have like reddish or purplish stretch marks, you can use it, and it'll help fade it away. It really softens your skin and smells great!|`|SMTE2KuPaa	There is a product called Strivectin,you can get it at drug stores. I bought mine at Shoppers Drug Mart.

I took zoloft a few years ago, and I started to feel great within a few weeks.  I felt so happy that I think I made people around me sick.  But then I started to feel really bad again, and it was worse.  A co worker of mine told me he took the drug zoloft to and it really messed with his head.  He felt it did permanant damage to his brain.  <br>  Quite often people end up getting worse and many people have died because they took their own life over it.  The people who make zoloft have paid out alot of money to familys who have lost someone.<br>  I would stop taking the meds right away.  You will be fine.<br>  Try not to depend on meds for help, they really don't do anything to help, as you must know by now.   Be more positive and don't think that anything in the form of a pill is going to change your life, cause it won't.  If I were you, I would check out some of the info I have given you and show it to your mother.  She won't want you to take it either.<br>  Also doctors are not all good.

71u8FVwyaa	Depo is my favorite birth control, but that is because nothing else works for me. I personally don't get any of the bad side effects.<br>  <br>  The problem with Depo is that if you do experience bad side effects from the injection, it takes the full course of the meds to ware off... that means three months. <br>  <br>  I hope that the depression is not caused by the depo. As I said before I LOVE it. I don't get a period so I have no cramps or bloating. I lost five pounds after starting it (no more midnight periods brownie batter cravings)... and my skin cleared up really well. <br>  <br>  If the depression really is triggered by the depo, don't get the second injection and the side effects should go away after the 3 month period. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

23aRL3Jmaa	wow.. that actually brought tears to my eyes. My younger sister has lived with Leukemia for 18 years. She was diagnosed when she was 3. I was only 6 at the time, and I must say, it wasn't easy growing up with a sibling going through cancer, but I know I was never that cruel. If he's been in the system most of his life, he can have issues simply with the fact your foster family has to spend alot of time with you because of the chemo and he feels left out. I know I did when I was growing up, but he needs to understand there's nothing you can do about that.

CciXZNYraa	You can try these;<br>  <br>  Belly rolls strengthen your vertical abdominal muscles. Sit with your legs bent, with feet flat on the floor and arms straight in front of you. Exhale and roll back until your lower back touches the ground and stop for a moment. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  In the same position, exhale and roll back until your shoulder blades touch the ground and momentarily stop. Inhale and roll back up. Repeat 15 times. <br>  <br>  Tummy curls work on your horizontal abdominal muscles. Lie on your back and bend your knees at an (almost) 90-degree angle to the floor with your feet raised slightly higher than your knees. Breathe out, lifting your butt and rolling back to your shoulder blades. Inhale and roll to your tailbone and stop. Try not to let your bottom touch the ground. Repeat 20 times. <br>  <br>  Cross crunches are hard work but they're miracle workers at cinching waists. You will need a liter bottle filled with water for this one. Lie on your back with your knees bent at a 90-degree angle with the floor. With your left hand cradling your head, hold the water bottle in your right hand. Lift your head and shoulders off the ground and reach across your body, so the bottle is outside your left knee. Pulse 20 times and then switch sides and repeat. <br>  <br>  Tailbone lifts work your lower abdomen and can help reduce a belly pouch. Lay on your back, with your arms stretched straight over your head and legs fully extended and crossed in the air. While breathing out, lift your tailbone then slowly lower as you inhale. To get maximum effect from this, don't let your bum just drop, you want to resist on the way down. Repeat 30 times. <br>  <br>  This is a favorite of mine as inverted crunches work your lower back which improves posture and strength. Lie on your belly with your arms in front of you as though you are flying like Superman. Exhale, lifting your right arm and left leg as high as you can. As you inhale, lower slowly. Switch, lifting your left arm and right leg.

2eztcCO0aa	You might just need to take showers that aren't so hot and use a moisturizing soap.  Also, get one of those scrubby things and use it to scrub your skin and get off the dead skin cells.  I use Dove extra rich shower gel, and it works great.  Don't shower more than once a day.<br>  <br>  If you still itch, it may be an allergy to your soap, your shampoo, your laundry soap or something else you come in contact with.  Or you may be sick.  If you have diabetes, your body will pull moisture from your skin to make you want to pee more often so it can get rid of the excess sugar in your blood.<br>  <br>  See your doctor, just in case.|`|B24W8w43aa	It is a sign of liver disease.|`|8nRVVuoKaa	You might want to read this...<br>  <br>  Mystery in the Skin:<br>  <a href="http://www.feb.se/ARTICLES/OlleJ.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.feb.se/ARTICLES/OlleJ.html</a><br>  <br>  And this...<br>  <br>  Electro Hypersensitivity - Talking to Your Doctor: <br>  <a href="http://weepinitiative.org/talkingtoyourdoctor.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://weepinitiative.org/talkingtoyourd...</a>|`|NnDkqau6aa	It is winter time, you might just have dry skin.

6ee4bbb0c984b702af22f462fd54e1caaa	That's wonderful that you are exercising although exercise isn't the only factor to losing weight. It is also your food intake. Like I always say, you can eat whatever you want just in proportion. Try to eat foods in smaller portions and slower than usual. the signal that you are full reaches your brain in 20 minutes so the slower you eat, the faster you will get full (ironic right?) Try not to eat in front of the tv because studies show that it makes you gain weight. Make sure that when you exercise you incorporate some cardio. you HAVE to get your heart pumping there is a certain rate that your heart has to be pumping before you burn ANY calories at all.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	you have to watch your diet to loose weight.  Also if you arent really working it and sweating you should increase what you are doing, step it up a bit and you will notice a difference.  What exercises are you doing?|`|AA11447210	If you don't change your diet, or you eat less, and you exercise an hour a day then yes...you should start to see some weight loss. Be careful that you don't eat more (or more calories) because of your working out.<br>  <br>  It may be a slow process, depending on the type and intensity of your exercise, versus your daily calorie consumption. You might go a week or over before you see the scales change.<br>  <br>  Also remember, when you start exercising you will start to tone and build a little muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat so while you may be losing inches, the scales might not change because your body is building heavier tissue (muscle) but it takes up less space than fat. You may notice your clothing becoming loose or you wearing your belt a bit tighter, even before you see the number on the scales go down.<br>  <br>  Have patience...the weight doesn't fall off overnight. A loss of 1-3 lbs/wk is a healthy rate (not too fast to risk it coming right back later).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1NPVVxW0aa	What exactly is this excercise for an hour every day?

Well, Okay I am, but still, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out you need to get more days off than once a week. My suggestion is run every other day.

This can be a bit unnerving, what with all the reflection, the bounce and any audience in attendance.<br>  <br>  I suggest, instead going for the porcelain bus.  Then you can shut the door and have a bit of privacy.  When you're in there, do the deal, be like the fireman with the hose, whatever.  Get to the end, do the shaking dance, let those drips fly all over (the cleaners love us guys).  When you've completed that, get some paper (toilet paper).  Just a bit.  Wipe the man eye man.  Pick up any lingering moisture.  A little bit of a squeeze should be applied.  Don't grab it hard and cut of circulation, just gentle, but expel any thing left and get it all dry with the absorbent paper sheet.<br>  <br>  See if that doesn't fix it.

Maybe they would if you had some sort of problem or infection there, but i would still doubt, I'm no doctor but I'm 99.9% sure they don't during a physical, They might look at you, but that's part of a physical, but they would not stick anything in there.|`|hc9deZ7aaa	No. If you have urinary symptoms (problems with peeing) then the Doctor will send you to a specialist who would do a lot of tests first before being invasive. If for whatever reason you needed something put into you it would be done in hospital.|`|hPbZcqLhaa	i have never heard of a doctor sticking anything in there during a physical. that would be horrifying. they just grab your balls and have you cough. and they have cold hands.

0HqIXMnWaa	Depends on individuals.  Could be 2 weeks to months.<br>  <br>  Best to try stop smoking weed altogether especially now it's hard to get a job.|`|wwP3ONCFaa	Im going to put it to you straight. All of the products they sell at GNC, Vitamin Shop, &Health food stores are absolute wastes of your money.<br>  <br>  If you are a small time user 1-2 times per month and have low body fat you should be clean within 2 weeks. If you are a chronic user it could take up to 6 weeks to detox.<br>  <br>  The metabolites of THC are lipid soluble, they are stored in fat cells. The individuals metabolism and exercise habits can make a difference in excretion of metabolites.<br>  <br>  A skinny person who exercises a lot and uses infrequently can test negative 3 days after using. A heavy person who doesnt exercise is in a bit of a bind.<br>  <br>  All those herbal extracts mentioned are now tested for first, before testing for illegal drugs, and may be considered by some labs to be a positive immediately. Some will forward it on for gas chromography analysis and a mass spectrography assay which will then find the metabolites you have tried to mask.<br>  <br>  Now I can tell you as a Medical Technologist and Pharmacist who conducted an experiments in a lab what does and doesnt work. The herbal masking agents do not work and will cause you more trouble then they are worth and will waste your money as well.<br>  <br>  You must detox using water. Large amounts of water must be ingested starting at least 36 hours before the test, up to 1 liter per 14.25kg of body weight per 24 hours. You must also supplement with creatine monohydrate, a bodybuilding supplement found in healthfood stores, at a rate of 1 teaspoon per 14.25kg of bodyweight. Just mix it with your liters of water. A prescription diuretic called Furosemide should also be added to ths water/creatine therapy at a dosage of 1 mg per kg of body weight per day administered in 2 doses. AM and Afternoon.<br>  <br>  When a specimen is examined they look for the diluteness of the sample by checking creatinine ( a byproduct of muscle metabolism) levels. Supplementing with creatine causes a sample taken after heavy water consumption to look as if normal creatinine levels are present. The diuretic which is very strong helps to flush the toxic and excess fluids from your body. Its like getting an oil change of sorts.<br>  <br>  THC metabolites may be present in your fat cells but you are essentially a faucet when you donate your specimen. The day of your test you should avoid excess physical activity and drink the water and creatine mixture and use the furosemide as stated above. You should also take Super B complex vitamins as well as vitamin C several times on the day of your test. This will provide color to the urine so that it does not appear as dilute. When you donate, urinate for a short time then hit the cup about 1/2 way through urination. This is so anything in the urethra is expelled prior to donation.<br>  <br>  Cranberry exctract may be added to the detox therapy above if you are concerned about kidney function while using the creatine monohydrate. I have been a regular smoker, 10-15 times per month, in average shpe, and used the above program to pass a screening exactly 7 days of no use.<br>  <br>  My colleagues have also used this method to test negative in screening. You may want to practice this several times, without the Furosemide. Follow the water and creatine method for 36-48 hours then get a clear glass and urinate in it as directed. Hold it up to the light and you should see the excess creatine monohydrate that has not been absorbed by the body floating in the urine like a suspension. Take your vitamins and repeat this process again. If you get a call from the testing agency inquiring about the creatinie in yoru urine simply tell then that you lift weights and jog and do use performance supplements. Good luck, this process has worked for many health care professionals who like to puff. That is why my colleagues and I set out to decifer a way to "pee clean". Good luck.|`|AA10034051	forever|`|HReTc9J5aa	For regular smokers the detox time is about 90 days.<br>  Drink a lot of water and you could shorten the time, probably by a month. <br>  <br>  For the week before your test, eat a lot of fiber, carbs, veggies and protein. Exercise too, to increase your metabolism and help speed things up (THC is stored in fat cells). Also during this week, be careful not to drink too much water since it could lower your creatinine levels and make your employer suspicious of other detox methods.|`|Su1TzeQpaa	Can take a long time to get out of your system, weeks or months.<br>  I'm pretty sure you can get stuff from a doctor or chemist that flushes it out in a matter of days but I can't recall its name.|`|13k2WKx8aa	You'll need at the very least one month to get it out of your system.<br>  <br>  Pre-employment screenings may also give way to random screenings.|`|RNdowYxeaa	Maybe a month in a half.

What makes it feel better, and what makes it go away? Example - positioning, movement, medications, distraction, time of day, eating, anything - what makes it happen and what makes it better?<br>  <br>  Identifying the pain is going to be a big part of trying to guess what's wrong with him.

He just talked to our doctor and found out that he qualified for a program that allows him completely free care from our doctor and the hospital that put doctor is affiliated with for 6 months. He also gets his blood tests, MRI, and X-rays done for free. He has to have surgery on the 16th and the surgeon that is doing it also offered the same financial aid so he gets the surgery covered as well. There is no reason for your brother not to see a doctor with these symptoms going on. There is help out there, you just have to do some asking and you will find it.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight. Effective weight training and a smart diet can help you exceed your genetically predetermined weight.|`|ilUkTIkWaa	okay, there are drinks such as sustagen that are designed to help with calorie intake. most supplement drinks have about 200-300 calories every 200mls, depends what brand. if your friend drinks that, as well as having normal meals, she should be able to gain weight at a healthy pace. she should consult her gp to find out more.<br>  xo|`|uY3nu8pPaa	Um..eat?

M2I0BNQUaa	I have angeline jolie lips, and I'm short and white, no beautiful african features for me, and I hate them, what I do is use a toner on them made up of a little vinegar, water, and lemon juice, it helps reduce the puffiness, and the over all puffiness is a result of too much slat in your diet, just to let you know! ;)|`|HDBIHGdMaa	yea i have that same problem..my lips are small but full...there is no way..but try waking up earlier so it will go down more
4UXJoMbKaa	I wouldn't call this an eating disorder, but rather just an unhealthy way of eating. If you're eating most/all of your food in one meal, you're slowing your metabolism way down. You're body needs nutrition all throughout the day. You should start eating breakfast. Even a bowl of cereal or some fruit is good. And definitely eat some lunch, even if it's just a granola bar, some fruits or veggies, or whatever. So basically, you don't have to be eating for these meals, but just eating in the first place. This way your body is getting the vitamins it needs and something to burn energy off of. Also, this keeps your metabolism moving. When you're not eating for such a long period, and then eating suddenly, your body automatically starts to store that energy for when it knows it will need it in the future, in the form of fat.<br>  <br>  :)|`|9OPoLvm7aa	If you honestly aren't hungry<br>  (which is pretty unlikely),<br>  then it's not an eating disorder,<br>  it's just unhealthy.<br>  You're probably not getting enough nutrients.<br>  <br>  However,<br>  if the reason that you don't eat<br>  is because you want to lose weight,<br>  or you're depressed (or something like that),<br>  then it is an eating disorder.<br>  It's not as extreme of a disorder as some are, though,<br>  and you don't need to take drastic measures.<br>  Just eat breakfast.<br>  <br>  Remember: a disorder is just something that is a little wrong.<br>  It doesn't have to be as extreme as bulimia to be<br>  considered an eating disorder.|`|iYvNKwwlaa	Ya my doctor told me to keep eating breakfast eat alot for lunch and less for dinner|`|AA10700407	not so much a disorder as not healthy.  it's never a good idea to skip meals.  lots of people don't like breakfast, but a piece of toast or some fruit would help fill your body's gas tank.  OK, you make it sound like you eat a bottle for lunch, but I know you mean you drink a bottle of water.  water is good, but has no real nutrition.  you should have some protein, like some tuna or a hard boiled egg or something.  you don't need to eat a lot, but fuel your body.  it's not an eating disorder, just your personal preference.  eating light meals or maybe having a nutrition drink would help keep you healthy.

While it was previously thought that HPV stayed in the body forever, new studies have found that it is rapidly cleared by the immune system as long as the person is in good health. If the person has HIV, cancer, or some other serious health problem, then the person may not be able to fight it off and it can turn to cancer..<br>  <br>  Most people have HPV. It's not a big deal.

A high glycemic index means that it the food will full you up for 10 minutes, and then you will be even more hungry, avoid foods like that when on a diet.
dbXnW5emaa	Welcome to puberty.  I think that's probably what it is.  That or sinuses.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You are dehydrated. Drink a bottle of water as soon as you wake up.

You may not be getting enough vitamins and water in your diet.|`|LC1fQjwGaa	Period?|`|YGYMocGRaa	been having constant headaches since my parents split up when i was 12. sodium metamizol has helped me ever since|`|Wj4nUvk4aa	Alright, first thing you should do is stop taking that aspirin. When you keep taking medicine every day your body tends to develop a habit of needing it. This actually makes your headache WORSE sometimes because the body begins to beg for it, and since you took it for headaches, it gives you one so that you take the aspirin. If you stop taking the aspirin, your headache should be a bit worse but after a day or two it'll either be gone or back to usual. Also, if your waking up tired and getting headaches, you might not be eating enough. You should eat healthy and don't worry about weight, if you do stuff during gym(unlike other teenagers) you'll be fit and slim. You might not be getting enough sleep also, which is generally what happens when you wake up tired. If your only getting about 6 or 7 hours of sleep, go to sleep earlier, it makes a HUGE difference. The only thing else I can think of is that your working yourself to hard, take a day to relax or to slack off, preferably a weekend is when most people like to recline.<br>  You should feel better after trying some of these things, and if not, then I suggest you let your parents know so that they can help you out too, sometimes a visit to the doctor's office is all you need(or advice from mom or dad).<br>  Feel Better Soon!

CyNFIa99aa	I really dont know WHAT namairb2 answerer was talking about! Down syndrome has nothing to do with recessive genes blah blah blah but instead a triple set of the 21st chromose in some or all of the cells. It can only be passed on from a parent who has DS otherwise it is just a chance occurence. Did they even answer your question, geneology and so forth rarely has anything to do with DS. but to answer your question, I did have a positve blood test and negative ultrasound and my son was born with a rare mild form of Down syndrome called Mosaic Down syndrome. I know how you may feel right now if this is your situation, I was there once myself. I was scared for my baby, then releaved after the ultrasound, then scared again once he was born and did indeed have Down syndrome (mosaic). Talk about a roller coaster. All I want you to know is that<br>  1.   I wouldnt EVER ask for my son to be any different than he is now. He is the most beautiful, wonderful little guy ever! <br>  <br>  2.  He is in early intervention which helps him reach his milestones at a good pace along with his peers and he will continue to get the help he needs throughout his life. He is very bright and charming, and everyone who meets him says hes the cutest kid ever and they fall in love with him<br>  <br>  3. Down syndrome is not what you think it is (unless you know someone with DS) you most likely have false ideas about it so I will lead you to some sites to help you learn all you can about it.<br>  <br>  I went along with my pregnancy a happy one, refused the amnio, and Im glad I did and not risk my son's life to find out something that wouldnt change me being his mother FIRST and FORMOST and him being MY SON! I thought after the ultrasound, 1 in a 100 chance, thats not me. But it was and thats ok, in fact great! Im very blessed. The only thing I regret is not looking into what DS is, not doing my research, because when he was born I was devastated. That is only because I didnt know anything about it, or what he could accomplish. I now know he can go to school, go to college, have friends, be smart, have talents, play sports, even get married and live on his own. What else would a mother want for their kid? The sky is the limit. Take care and just know everything no matter what will be fine. Also now that blood tests have high numbers of false positives so most likely your baby is typical. And before you take any other steps, PLEASE go to these sites.............|`|AA10450066	As you didn't come down with downs yourself, then it would probably be a recessed gene, giving any child only about a quarter chance or less depending on the genealogy of the father. As long as your ob/gyn knows than don't worry about it. That is what they do.Your body is going through enough changes to have that on your mind too. Stress isn't good for you or your baby. Remember, you're already a mom with a little one depending on you to keep yourself healthy.

wwP3ONCFaa	burns that demand a doctor's immediate attention:<br>  Burns that show signs of infection, including a blister filled with greenish or brownish fluid, or a burn that becomes hot again or turns red.<br>  <br>  Inspect and measure your burn. You can usually self-treat first- and second-degree burns smaller than a quarter on a child or smaller than a silver dollar on an adult. See a doctor for larger burns or for burns on infants under 1 year old or people over 60.<br>  <br>  Dab on an antimicrobial cream. An over-the-counter antibiotic ointment containing the active ingredients polymyxin B sulfate or bacitracin will discourage infection and speed your healing.|`|U9lhqpaHaa	oh my gosh, i feel your pain!! i swear there is no greater pain on earth than a burn!

LfLJtSTxaa	Okay, so you're going to the orthodontist tomorrow. Yes, you'll probably be getting your braces on. Here's a HUGE piece of advice: BRING SOME LIP BALM. Blistex, Carmex, any kind of moisturizing lip balm. You WILL need it. They'll put a plastic or metal thing in your mouth to keep your lips away from your teeth, so they can glue on the brackets. This will dry out your lips like you wouldn't believe.<br>  <br>  The braces also do hurt. It might not hurt right away, but because your teeth aren't used to having the tension on them that the wires and elastics create, by the next morning you're going to be in pain. Plan on having oatmeal or scrambled eggs for breakfast because that's about all you'll be able to eat without difficulty.<br>  <br>  As for the jaw thing, I'm not sure precisely what you're talking about but it might well involve breaking and resetting your jaw.<br>  <br>  Final tip: Always, ALWAYS wear your elastics, but DO NOT try and double up to cut the treatment time by wearing two elastics on the same brackets. My cousin tried it, he overcorrected and had to have his braces on an additional six months.|`|2FsNdcXEaa	No, they aren't. Why? Because they are dentists. Dentists don't give braces, orthodontists do.|`|hh403SkVaa	they most likely wont give you braces cause they aren't orthodontists..<br>  <br>  they will probably give you choices of orthodontists and such

BdlGBdE5aa	You are right in asking for help with your bad breath, however, the solution is actually very easy if you understand the real cause of bad breath.  Up to 90 % of bad breath is caused by bacteria that are on the top of the tongue.  These bacteria often appear as "white stuff" on your tongue.  This material must be cleaned off in order to get rid  of bad breath.  Mints and gum just cover up bad breath for a short time, they do nothing to get rid of bad breath.  Good oral hygiene is to brush and floss the teeth and then clean the tongue.  I use OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and scraper.  It only costs a few dollars at: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>  It will be the best money you ever spent.|`|0uvgAKSZaa	Have you tried brushing your tongue/buying a tongue scraper to scrape all that gunk and bacteria off. If your tongue is really white then that can be causing some bad breath, you need to brush your tongue really good and rinse with mouth wash.Im not sure about the mucus causing something tho, unless you have an infection but who knows you'd have to go to your doctors for that. It also might be maybe if one of your teeth have broke and its rotting so it causes the smell.

6MCHDMbzaa	you really shouldn't be thinking about boys testicles.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	It's usually a misuse of the term. <br>  <br>  Testicles 'dropping' normally happens in the womb. The testes start to develop in the abdomen, near where ovaries would be. As the fetus starts to show sexual differentiation, the gonads migrate down into the scrotal sac and develop into testes. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, one or both testicles do not descend into the scrotum, and stay in the abdomen. If they do not migrate down (or "drop") sometime before puberty, they will need to be surgically brought down to the correct place before they grow too big.<br>  <br>  Now, a lot of times when people refer to a guy's "balls dropping" they are simply referring to the growth that occurs during puberty, when the testes become larger and the scrotum begins to stretch more, making them hang lower from the body.|`|VIM4XmYNaa	When the testicles get too warm, they drop a little farther out from the body so as not to kill the sperm with high temperatures.  The scrotum must constantly be 1 degree below body temperature to produce sperm.  I've also heard it used when a guy is being a coward, like, not being "manly".|`|b2d07243a56fe86e58deeafb008493abaa	it means when a boy enters puberty and his testicles have to be lower temperature than his body to make sperm so the ball sac loosens up and the testicles start to hang lower than the body  and make sperm|`|eHkmAYR5aa	butter fingers.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	WTF you talking about?
RXI8ImdIaa	You're probably not done at 15. But with your parents' heights, you are already within the expected range so there's a chance you could be done growing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally I was done growing in height around age 15-16, but lots of guys grow more until they are in their early 20s.<br>  <br>  I don't think your early birth is affecting this, you're already as tall as your mom, and your dad's not a very tall guy either.|`|9xhkOuuBaa	Ignore the 1st guy above. Maybe but at 15 you've got a long way to go|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Has nothing to do with premature.  You're parents are small so you may be short too.  You may still grow though, but maybe not much.  Go to your doc and tell him to give you HGH.

438bb86a06aa4d7e209129e38aeefd72aa	I was in the same position as you, and unfortuantly the only real option is the surgery (Im waiting for my op date atm) You can have braces but it will do nothing with your overbite, just correct your teeth, and from what i know and have been told by my orthodontist, there really isnt any other option.<br>  <br>  The surgery is called "Maxillofacial" <br>  <br>  The only thing i can suggest is to see your Dentist / Othodontist, and ask about it|`|1ZNNKY2uaa	i have braces and i did have an overbite i got my teeth fixed and my over bite it does work but if you teeth are not that  bad talk to you dentist and see about a retainer.|`|wOecmtrzaa	No, you shouldn't HAVE to have surgery.  You probably could get braces to fix it, dependign on the situation.  Most mild overbite can be fixed with braces.<br>  <br>  You would really need to talk to your ortho, because it depends on the case.  Sometimes they can squeeze your top teeth back, sometimes your bottom teeth can be pulled forward.  It really just depends on how bad your overbite is and your tooth crowding situation.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Remember, even if you have to have surgery, you will be so happy with a beautiful smile!  And dental surgery is not as bad as it seems.  I would much rather have oral surgery than anything else like it anywhere else on my body.

RgEtKVaKaa	How frightening! Why does your friend believe this is an ulcer on his tonsil? Has he had this before?  As a nurse, I have seen "ulcers" on tonsils however that is not what they are customarily called. Your friend needs to see a doctor ASAP.  Bleeding like this must be diagnosed.  Tonsillitis & strep throat can cause "ulcers" on tonsils.  Medical attention is necessary.  Good luck to you & your friend.|`|AA10450066	Did you see any off this blood? If not maybe he wants your attention and to feel sorry for him.Maybe he bit his tongue.But there's no such thing as an ulcer on your tonsils.Believe me if he was coughing up blood he would probably be so scared he would have showed one of his parents by now.Tell him if he's still coughing it up and he doesn't tell them then you have to call 911 so the EMT's can come and take a look at him.That should tell you if he is or not.Maybe you should let his parents know,tell him and see if he wants attention or he's really sick.
IkHTD61Gaa	firs of all just sneak some meds with yu ;p that what i do .lol. and i would start with the regluars with the plastcic aplicator. also i fould that for my first time some vasiline helped. it takes ALOT of patience for the 1st time. the box always comes with instructions. <br>  i would reccomend:<br>  -PLATEX SPORT (the best of the best)<br>  - tampax pearl<br>  -platex soft comfort<br>  <br>  <br>                                   *best of luck!|`|uAzToWC7aa	just read the label, and its pretty straighforward, get the right size and only leave it in for maximum of 5 hours. ( :|`|AA10755633	hey so i would try to insert your first tampon before you to camp so you will feel more comfortable when your their. Try Light tampons like tampax lites or playtex gentle glide slender tampons. A plastic applicator is best for the first time. It is easist to insert a tampon on your heaviest day.  Relax, and aim for your lower back. REMEMBER never leave a tampon in for more then eight hours! and always use the least asorbency for your flow - which is why it is good to start at home! if it doesnt work the first time try again! also if your gonna be active and the tampons arent working out try a pad with wings, it will help your pad stay in place while your active. You can always ask the nurse for meds, i know its embarssing but it will be worth it!<br>  <br>  also try watching this video - no worries not graphic! <a href="http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/yourperiod_inserttampon.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/yourperio...</a><br>  <br>  that site also has lots of info for girls about periods and tampons<br>  <br>  Remember to bring MORE then enough supplies for camp! you never know! also dont forget overnight pads which are important so you dont leak on your sheets because you cant just throw them in the wash at camp! also keep a secret chocolate stash just for your period!<br>  <br>  good luck|`|k2M4CG03aa	ok, using a tampon is easy the first time. trust me! and make sure you get the right angle, u should probably look it up on the internet.  good luck!

qrGLcTh4aa	Yes you can eat. They should tell you to eat whatever you want, but eat on the opposite side until you get the crown. If you're going to get the crown on the same day of the root canal then you should wait a few days to eat on it because you will be sensitive.<br>  You actually shouldn't be in too much pain, you will be sensitive that is normal but you shouldn't be in pain.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	You can drink.

8WYWEDOpaa	I'm sorry that you have to go through this.  I know what you're going through, though.  My curve was around 45 degrees in high school.  It increased to 60 degrees by the time I had surgery later in life.<br>  <br>  45 degrees is in the range that surgery is recommended.  We usually say 50+ degrees but 45 isn't unheard of.<br>  <br>  If you're not seeing a scoliosis specialist, you should find one.  Any help a chiropractor gives you is only temporary.  They can't change the shape that your bones (vertebrae) have grown.<br>  <br>  You've done the right thing by reaching out and trying to talk with others.  I was pretty sad in high school but I thought I knew everything and never tried to be with others.  Looking back, I wish I had.<br>  <br>  I've posted the following a few times for other people with questions. I hope I'll answer the things that have you concerned.<br>  <br>  Scoliosis comes mainly in two flavors - functional (the curve is caused by another issue (uneven leg length for example) and structural.  There are two main kinds of structural scoliosis - congenital (present at birth) and idiopathic (unknown cause).  It is important for you to know what kind you have.<br>  <br>  If you have functional scoliosis, a chiropractor may be able to help.  Shoe lifts may help with uneven legs, but there can be many causes of functional scoliosis.  I don't have much experience with functional scoliosis.<br>  <br>  If you have structural scoliosis, there's not a lot you can do.  The main treatments depend on how bad the curve is and how much more growth you have to go.  Its not possible to predict how much or how fast a curve may increase.<br>  <br>  You need to see a scoliosis specialist if you're not doing that already. A doctor that is not trained as a scoliosis specialist doesn't have the expertise to treat it.<br>  <br>  Any curve under 10 degrees is considered normal and probably isn't monitored.<br>  <br>  Curves from 10-25 degrees are mild but should be monitored, especially if you're still growing.<br>  <br>  Curves from 25-40 degrees are moderate with bracing possible. You will need monitoring, especially if you're still growing.<br>  <br>  Surgery may be recommended if your curve doesn't respond to bracing. Bracing will do no good if you're through growing. The purpose of a brace isn't to make your curve better, but rather to keep the curve from becoming worse.<br>  <br>  Curves greater than 45 degrees is major. Surgery may be recommended. This depends on many things, but whether you're done growing, whether your curve is increasing, whether your heart and lungs are in danger of being squeezed by your curve, whether you're in pain, quality of life, etc.<br>  <br>  If your curve is over 30 degrees, there is a good chance that it will increase even when you're through growing.  (Mine did.)<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, nothing can *fix* idiopathic scoliosis. Surgery can keep the curve from getting worse, and in most cases, will reduce the curve but most likely your spine won't be straight (unless you are very flexible in the area to be fused, then you might be lucky).<br>  <br>  Chiropractors, message therapists, acupuncturists, etc., can't fix idiopathic scoliosis. These people adjust the soft, connective tissues and that may (or may not, you can't tell ahead of time) make you feel better, but remember, idiopathic scoliosis is not a connective tissue disease. Your spine is growing curved.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	I too have this and i know the pain your going through(mine is 60 degree),and i have had surgery for it,but you should rest plenty, try when you lie down put a pillow under your knees,and when you lie on your side put a pillow between your knees, this helps take the pressure off your spine so eases the pain! i have also got a step stool by my bed, to help me climb in(about 10 ins high)this helps you not to twist your back at the waist, so you should try it it really helps.|`|pkSNFO5paa	Sorry you feel this way. I also gave scoliosis, but it's only 25 degrees. I had a spinal fusion surgery for a severe slipped disk last year,though, and I needed to wear something similar to a boston brace for 5 months. And I'm always dislocating joints because I have hypermobility syndrome, so I know how that feels. I'm fifteen years old, so I can kind of relate to you. I know it sucks, but when you think about it, this is only going to be something for a short term. Your 13 years old, so your probably going to be done growing soon, and you wont have to wear your brace=) If you need someone to talk to, your free to email me if you want. I hope everything turns out okay!

FU4TyghIaa	Which is worse and everything.  Good question.<br>  Hey, i'm thinking that alcohol kills more people who are innocent.<br>  By that i mean, more drink drivers crash and kill innocent people who have never touched it, like children and stuff.<br>  And they talk about passive smoking?<br>  Try to call the road toll passive drinking.<br>  <br>  Which is worse?<br>  There's no hard and fast answer as far as i can see.  Depends on the individual and what they're mental state/personality is like.<br>  <br>  Pot can really mess up people with a propensity for mental illness.  That's true.<br>  Alcohol kills people on the road and sets off people who  have a tendency to aggression.<br>  <br>  Pot must be contributing to the road toll, it's hard to get stats on this and make a proper comparison.  But then, stone heads might even be less likely to drive while people who have been drinking, even not to excess, might be more confident to drive, even when not drunk, but just with a reduced ability.  In an accident situation, they respond slower.<br>  <br>  Direct effect, like brain damage, lung damage, versus brain damage, liver and kidney damage.<br>  They both destroy the brain.  Pickled or fried?  <br>  <br>  I think the alcohol is worse, that's my view, but if you wanted to get technical, it would be hard to get a straight answer.<br>  <br>  There's many factors to consider when you include the innocent parties in the analysis.  <br>  Then the answers may be effected because you ask what's worse and people answer it sure, but worse they mean what's more uncool?|`|sefh6mJ6aa	It would depend what you value more, the brain, or liver and health? smokin pot will cause your brain to not function properly, and it will make your memory shorter, in other words, you'll be getting dumber each cone you rip. but drinking, it'll make you fatter, unhealthy, and give you permanent liver damage. Smoking pot damages your brain much much more then drinking would, but in my opinion, i think casually smoking pot is worse, because imagine living with a **** brain that you cant use? you can always regain health by eating properlly and excersising.|`|vx2MaQg0aa	I say alcohol is much more worse for you than weed.. I smoked weed for 4 years every single day and i stopped it cuz i didnt enjoyed it as much as i use to so its def not addicting..

They both do some damage if done everyday but if its casually i say weed is better.. Cause its illegal doesn't make it bad..<br>  You decide yourself|`|BeMvDZUAaa	Two main reasons why drugs are worse:<br>  1. Pot is much more addictive, and has greater health problems associated with it.<br>  <br>  2. This one matters if your over 21: Alcohol is legal and socially accepted, (or if your under 21, you shouldn't be doing either!!"|`|oxPt0KTPaa	drinkings more dangerous than pot, just because its illegal doesnt mean anything...heck, having sex,riding bike, and jumping on a tarmpoline are more dangerous than smoking pot...alcahol isnt that dangerous really either but...i mean cmon pot just makes question reality and makeya hungry...and tired.|`|nkiwlf7Paa	They say drugs because it's a normal programmed response because pot is illegal.

Menstruation can be very irregular. Sometimes you can miss a month entirely. It may be a result of your endometrium being very thick.  But you say you get off it for like 2 and half months. I think that all the blood and tissue is building up during those months and then your on it for around a month straight because all that stuff is built up in excess amounts. But if your that worried about it yeah go to the doctor.|`|QewQsVCaaa	First of all, it is normal to experience irregularity. A month long however? I think a short trip to the doctor might be able to clear this all up. A hormone problem could even be the culprit. <br>  <br>  So, yes, I believe you SHOULD see your OB/GYN. She or he will be able to help you figure out a  solution- because who wants periods that last a month anyway? :)|`|lbqZ05KBaa	You do need to see your OB GYN.  They will help you resolve the root of the issue.  This should not happen.  You will probably also need to take iron supplements as your are probably anemic as a result of losing so much blood.  <br>  You may just need a simple procedure called a D&C- which cleans out the lining of your uterus and makes it easier for the lining to shed each month.  <br>  Also, my periods were never regular until I went on birth control.  I would skip for up to 6 months at a time.|`|6mpfxYwmaa	ive only heard of that from a story in the bible. so yeah id see a doctor as soon as you can good luck :)|`|pkUkIQoEaa	one of those "periods" was me poppin ur cherry did u 4get? lmao jk idk u prolly jus got alota blood idk|`|S3Mqe64Aaa	you REALLY need to go see and OB GYN ! like...seriously ! that's bad.|`|2aMKigAWaa	well a lot of people have told you to see a doctor...<br>  don't worry you will be fine.

Women usually start to have fewer periods between ages 39 and 51. Women in their 40s and teens may have cycles that are longer or change a lot. If you are a teen, your cycles should even out with time. If you are nearing menopause, your cycles will probably get longer and then will stop.<br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor if you notice any big change in your cycle. It’s especially important to check with your doctor if you have three or more cycles that last longer than 7 days or are very heavy. Also call if you have bleeding between your periods or pelvic pain that is not from your period.<br>  here is a link from the source I used for this info, hope it helps.<br>  <a href="http://women.webmd.com/tc/normal-menstrual-cycle-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://women.webmd.com/tc/normal-menstru...</a>
RzaP9bQmaa	Well lets just say you won't be going a sleep for a long time. <br>  In fact you might even try to climb the walls|`|6lmFyr2maa	i dont know about taking red bull- vodka with pro plus but red bull- vodka on its own gives you very bad heart paliptations because the red bull makes your heart beat faster whereas the alcohol on the vodka tries to make it beat slower.<br>  <br>  smoking, drinkin & pro plus = not good, not good for your body at all, i wouldnt make a habbit of it, one off is probably not going to do much damage<br>  <br>  xxx|`|Rk46lIBwaa	Do you really think anything you did was healthy.<br>  <br>  Moderate your alcohol, stop smoking all together and avoid Red Bull and for that matter Pro-Plus.|`|paJ0oHhHaa	you will be fine, unless you are sentitive to caffeine then you will be fine, 35cl is not a lot, at all and if you had loads of red bull with it then there won't be a problem, you might just have a tough time sleeping lol but you only live once, you don't need to sleep|`|mhp7JKMNaa	FACT: Nothing is good for you besides water. Everything has a little harmful side effect.<br>  <br>  quit smoking, NO BENIFITS.<br>  <br>  And for the drinking part, red bull just has a ton of caffeine. Annoyingly a lot.|`|K4Y76H3qaa	Red bull has lots of caffeine, and mix with vodka can get you very well intoxicated, However, the hang over are very bad.|`|sNPjBNEqaa	i did this and had palpitations|`|9T09iprPaa	red bull and pro plus are just caffine fix so dont worry, if i have a session i have a drink called a TVR which is Tequila Vodka and Red Bull im well into double figures when it comes to how many i drink of them, my only fear is not being asleep when the hangover starts|`|ly0SWLwxaa	Im not sure about the pro plus<br>  <br>  but the red bull/vodka is very dangerous.  the caffeine speeds up the alchohol into your system.  I say if you're able to type this you'll be fine, but if anything feels wrong get in touch with a doctor.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	That wouldn't be the smartest thing in the world to do. Do not do it. <br>  <br>  I would say it is not safe.|`|eXYfweD6aa	idk it says on the red bull bottle not to mix it with alcohol, i wouldn't mess around with that shitt|`|2pqxRCyLaa	safe as a dollar store condom|`|S0zbFmcMaa	dfdffffffffffffffffffffffffffff|`|fubvELd2aa	Lol R ur a geek man shurr upwe cant just live from water u gorra liv a lil man
wOecmtrzaa	Ok take a breath, you'll be okay whatever happens!<br>  <br>  There are two diffrent ways to fill a cavity: good old drill and fill and newer air abrasion or "airbrushing". With air abrasion you need no type of anesthetic; in fact it really is more painless than getting your teeth cleaned!<br>  <br>  But say you need a drill and fill fix. ( airbrush only works on small surface cavities). You will most def. Need Novocain in this situation, but you'll be okay!  Your DDS can give you nitrous oxide, which is a gas you breath to make you kinda high.  He will gas you up and, really truthfully, you shouldn't care what's going on! <br>  <br>  Since you are nervous/scared, THE BEST thing you can do during your apt will be talk to your dental assistant and tell her how you feel. Since you will probably have NOx, she will stay next to you the ENTIRE time you are in the chair. She can help you SO SO much feeling better and less worried. <br>  <br>  Getting a cavity filled you shouldn't feel any pain AT ALL, really. Your DDS will apply a topical anesthetic so you won't even feel the needle go in.   If you are ever in pain during g the process, you should just raise up your hand and your DDS can stop and reapply pain meds. <br>  <br>  You will be FINE as long as you talk to your dental assistant!  That's the biggest piece of advice I can give you, and I have a lot of dental patient experience!<br>  <br>  Also, I also deathly Hate needles, but never have had a problem with dental needles. Perhaps you will be the same? Just don't look at them and talk to your dental assistant and you will do fine!<br>  <br>  I know you can do it! Just think of how much better it will be without that cavity!|`|tBZ2BbuEaa	I depends on how bad the cavity is. Mine were on the surface of the teeth, so I did not need it.
VZ90Erh7aa	um I don't think it makes your teeth less sensitive I think it's for people with sensitive teeth you know like they make sensitive baby wipes for babies with sensitive bums<br>  ....wow I've written the word sensitive a lot haha|`|VjKZhIywaa	i does not it just makes people who have sensitive teeth feel better it is not as minty or as strong|`|nBjQQ3yraa	fills in holes in the enamel I think!|`|9EW08emXaa	I asked my dentist...she said it is the toothpaste makers trade secret.  What kind of lame answer is that.  <br>  <br>  I think it's because they are higher in fluoride...maybe?|`|vDSRgHxDaa	I think it's just marketing to try and make you buy it, as it does not work for me.
Yc6eUIW9aa	Maybe you need to floss.|`|TSVPV6Nvaa	Sounds like you're teething.  When wisdom teeth grow in, they can be painful and cause the gums around it to swell.  Try rising with warm salt water or hydrogen peroxide to keep it from getting infected.  <br>  <br>  Third molars can also grow in weird.  (Mine grew INTO my cheek and carved a hole into it!)  Sounds like you'll need them pulled.  They are only effective if you can keep them clean or if they grow in properly.  Otherwise, get rid of them.

nr5VfSguaa	Depends on your height. Try more physical activity and instead of dieting cut out unnecessary foods and try fruit and veggies.|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|F5ptObE8aa	ur fine!! don't get mad just cause you don't have the body of a six year old boy. your nine. you shouldn't be worrying about this yet. <br>  <br>  try eating healthy foods and exercising. it'll help<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|UkOAxlDRaa	seriously you don't need to go on a diet.  you are soooo young. you are still growing which means you need all the nutrients you can get.  All you have to do is eat healthy.  like the first person said eat lots of fruits and veggies. eat those like crazy!!!!! eat balanced meals. you can find a food guide pyramid anywhere. just type in food guide pyramid in google and youll find it from there.  that will give you an idea of what you need to be eating and in what amounts.  Don't get all obsessed over it though to the point where you are counting how much you eat.   you don't need to be so precise.  you're still young so your metabolism probably still in very good condition. don't eat so many sweets like candy, those make you fat. also way greasy foods aren't good for you at all either.  Once in a while it is ok to indulge in a little fun food but not all the time. And another thing, do something physical!! GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY!!!! at your age i was always outside playing with friends. i don't ever remember even thinking about my weight. Do anything that involves moving.  don't just sit and watch tv. go to the park or walk your dog (if you have one).  you will eventually grow and everything will portion out! don't worry about it too much. try to be as healthy as possible!!<br>  i really hope this helps a little <br>  good luck!|`|35hviVqFaa	calm. down. Here's the diet that worked for me: salad (only a little bit of ranch) for lunch. plain oatmeal for breakfast (only one pack), and fish or chicken for dinner. I lost 10 lbs that way.<br>  I don't think you are 'fat', but remember to exercise a lot
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Okay, I have motivation for myself, get this.  I'm having a tubal reversal so my husband and I can have a child together.  I have 8 lbs left to lose BY the end of this month, Kinda freakin out, but I'll be fine.<br>  Anyways,<br>  From my sisters...<br>  No sodas, drink plenty of water, fruits before noon, salads after, No more than 1-2 nights with red meat.  All other nights fish and chicken.<br>  On top of that, did you know that when walking, or whatever you do to work out, within the first 20 minutes, you have burned most of the calories you have taken in for the day.  after that, you are burning fat.  I also swim.  Its easier on the knees and the back and is really a great Cardio workout and to lose weight, you definately want Cardio.<br>  Get a photo of you now and when you were smaller, or a pic of a dress or a cute short outfit, or whatever.  Definately do it for you, but when you start losing, you are going to feel so much more energy and you will start glowing from feeling better.<br>  When I started noticing the jeans were hard to hold up, I got even more excited about losing weight.  <br>  .|`|47dc2f11cb6ecb3751db2c71a12b6c33aa	The answer is you and self motivation. It is such a simple task which becomes difficult because of our abilities to find reasons or other excuses to put off what your after till you finally quit.You got to make not a option but a task that you are going to complete, learn not to take it too serious keep a sense of humor and tell yourself that you are going to do it..

Works like a charm. A constant reminder of where I want to be is REALLY motivating.|`|c922633c597731abb86aae9cac7f9c32aa	i dont about running but try this<br>  <br>  Stop the fizzy drinks.<br>  exercise for about 15 mins or more everyday.<br>  Eat healthy food<br>  Drink ALOT of lemon juice or make it yourself and drink it instead of fizzy drinks and its much better.<br>  whenever you have nothing to do go for a walk<br>  also go to the gym<br>  <br>  do this for a week and will see a BIG difference!!

It will still kill bacteria, but your tongue won't be the color of the mouthwash and your mouth won't feel so raw.|`|cZcS54ujaa	Yes the salt will help draw the swelling out of the tissue. mouthwash will burn do the salt water as hot as u can stand it|`|FIG58FVpaa	Yes.

It's a diet based on mostly vegetables/fruit and some protein is a way to eat healthy and loose weight! The anti-inflammatory diet is based roughly on the "paleolithic diet." And, it's basically about making all the food you consume count toward something your body needs. It sounds simple but so many of the things we buy at the grocery store are not foods at all! You don't have to count calories, you just replace the junk food with a snack that's good for you. Google "deflame" and "Dr. Seaman" and you will find the link. There's a great pdf file that you can download for free and it tells you how to follow the diet. <br>  In terms of your arm. I'm not sure how old your injury is and what the circumstances are around the bone. So, if you're going through physical therapy tha would be the best place to start since they will know what your limitations are. I hope this helps. Best of luck to you and good eating!

A papilloma is a non-cancerous, wart-like tumor with a stalk which grows inside the breast duct. Other benign conditions that cause suspicious nipple discharge include fibrocystic conditions or duct ectasia (widening and hardening of the duct due to age or damage). A nipple discharge is more likely to be of concern if it is bloody or watery with a red, pink, or brown color; if it is sticky and clear or brown to black in color; if it appears spontaneously without squeezing the nipple; if it is persistent; if it occurs only on one side; or if it is a fluid other than breast milk.
4KRSUhXLaa	Low-level cardio is good for burning fat. Walking, biking, rowing, something that will increase your heartrate no more than 65% than your resting rate (typically 120-125 for 20-30 yr olds).<br>  Unfortunately, the abs are the last area we lose fat from. The changes start at the extremities and work towards the core. However, do plently of upper/lower abs, obliques, and lower back exercises to focus and start toning that area.<br>  <br>  Do regular crunches, then alternate side crunches (lie on back, knees bent, rest right calf on left thigh and bring left elbow to right knee, do the same for the other side)<br>  For the lower abs, lie on back, hands to sides, lift both legs slightly off the ground and hold for 2-5 sec. OR lie on back, lift both legs slightly off ground and open them up to shoulder width and bring back together. repeat as above.<br>  For lower back, lie on stomach, legs stretched out, put hands behind head and using abs, lift your shoulders off ground and do "backwards crunches".<br>  For sides, stand with feet shoulder width apart, arms down to sides,holding weight (5-10 lbs) in one hand, bend to the side from the waist lowering weight towards your knee, use other hand to reach over head as you bend.<br>  Some other great exercises are lunges, push-ups.<br>  Challenging one for legs, thighs and butt: lie on floor on side one leg onto of another. Use the top leg to "spell" out the alphabet or numbers 1-25. The bigger the letters the more you will feel it.<br>  (I've tried it and I can only get to letter K before the muscles burn)|`|c7KCto2Raa	When you workout you burn fat all over your body, its doesn't matter what your working out.

WwPkz3Emaa	Well this one is also about $8 but it is realllly good.  The dove clinical protection.  Its really good|`|AlM5xtc4aa	Dove Ultimate clear. I only put on 5 layers...lasts through school and through 4 hours of dance class. I LOVE IT|`|a2ol5COXaa	i heard dove was good :)|`|hZU4K49baa	dont get dove if you sweat bad because it made my pits smell like cat piss|`|blwDnJy4aa	I hear that this clear dry deoderant completely stops the sweat for a day. You have to get a prescription though, and the cost runs around 15-20 dollars, not to mention that it literally dries out your armpit and you'll have to moisturize it often. But other than that, it sounds like the shizz nizz.<br>  <br>  I personally have tried Dove Clinical Strength and it didn't do a darn thing. I still had sweat marks, and I still sweated like I usually do.|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	Secret is pretty good. I HATE dove. <br>  Don't get secret gel. It is really wet.
c7KCto2Raa	listen gloves will not do jack for you sorry to tell you, but if you wish to get stronger you may want to look into so lifting straps, those are the real deal..... plus you can do forced sets with more reps and heavier weight at certain times leading to increase in strength|`|487515c85b64d4c719964adadc2e3e0eaa	the pretty pink ones are soooo cuuute on guys.
tXONUHBIaa	To protect your body you should use your normal stride length when walking. If you abnormally shorten up your stide or lengthen it you'll change how the biomechanics of your body function and you could risk getting knee, hip or low back pain. So, monitoring your heart rate is probably the best way to stay in the "fat-buring zone" and get the most benefit from walking. There are some great free websites that can help you determine your "target heart rate." Just google it and there are may to choose from. Best of luck to you.|`|c922633c597731abb86aae9cac7f9c32aa	i dont which is better but dont put your in stress try these tips<br>  <br>  Stop the fizzy drinks.<br>  exercise for about 15 mins or more everyday.<br>  Eat healthy food<br>  Drink ALOT of lemon juice or make it yourself and drink it instead of fizzy drinks and its much better.<br>  whenever you have nothing to do go for a walk<br>  also go to the gym<br>  <br>  do this for a week and will see a BIG difference!!|`|q0ecHVRFaa	what she said is right
VQlXF8Ucaa	Yes it could be osteoarthritis, I have it and fibromyalgia, very painful stuff.  I hated the shots to the knees, omg after one shot I couldn't walk for a week, my knee would not bend.  Osteoarthritis is hereditary so if your mother has it it is very likely that this is what you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  They have this stuff at the pharmacy, it is called Percogelsic, it is the strongest over the counter pain killer you can buy.  It does make you sleepy though.  Also instead of ice, try the heat wraps that you can buy at the pharmacy or a topographical cream like Ben Gay.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes things don't show up on X-Rays, I had X-Rays of my back done and nothing showed up on the X-Rays, they had to do an MRI and a CT Scan.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	Yes. Or it could be early-onset Calcium pyrophosphate-deposition disease (CPDD) which can take place between the 2nd and 5th decades of life. See <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1801178" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a><br>  <br>  Those who work in occupations that require a great deal of physical exertion, such as construction workers, are at a higher risk of developing osteoarthritis at a relatively young age. People who are overweight may also develop it early on.<br>  <br>  But it is rare in people under 40.
9d8k5hBfaa	I definitely would recommend keeping a food journal. That is the only thing that helps my eating under control. Write down what you eat and the number of calories and aim for the 1200-1400 calorie per day zone. Whenever you feel like eating something unhealthy, fix something nutricous like a fruit smoothie. I personally like flavored water (0 calories) and 100 calorie yogurts. Once you look over your food journal and look at the numbers of calories, you will feel much more motivated to eat right. good luck :)|`|TT7O1JXUaa	Eating the wrong foods can cause havoc with your blood sugar levels which causes you to be hungry and put on weight. <br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.scarsdale-diet.com/good-and-bad-carbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scarsdale-diet.com/good-and-b...</a>

Even if it's just for "a moment" you still run the risk of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  At this point, it's too late for Plan B to work (you need to take it within 24 MAX 72 hours after the first unprotected encounter happened).<br>  <br>  Basically, if you don't get your period when you are due, take a test. If nothing comes up and you STILL don't get a period, go to the gyno and get some blood work done.<br>  <br>  Best of luck whatever happens.|`|qHOTa0Pbaa	You should be good. Wait it out and try not to stress because if you stress it will make your period late.

I suggest you do more serious exercise like cycling or running (running is one of the most energy-consuming activities, cycling is less than half the energy output). The thing is, running will make you fit if you keep at it for like an hour every second day. The point of getting fit in relevance to losing weight is that when you are fit your body will be far better at breaking down fat. When unfit, your body breaks down mainly carbohydrates.
Voq6D4a1aa	Actually a 5'3 person should be 111-118 and thats if you have a small frame so you are perfect weight really. For a medium range it is 121-135.   Ab workouts could tighten your abs but you don't really need to try to lose more weight. I say you stay the way you are and just continue doing mild exercise working on things you want to improve such as abs.

2sycPf8Daa	Heart palpitations cause the sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats. Although heart palpitations can be worrisome, they're often harmless. Common causes of heart palpitations include: <br>  Anxiety ,Stress .Exercise ,Caffeine .Nicotine .Fever <br>  Hormone changes associated with menstruation, pregnancy or menopause <br>  Certain medications, such as pseudoephedrine, an ingredient in some cold and allergy medicines <br>  Often the cause of heart palpitations can't be determined. However, occasionally, heart palpitations can be a sign of a serious, underlying problem such as hyperthyroidism or an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Arrhythmias may include very fast heart rates (tachycardia), unusually slow heart rates (bradycardia) or an irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation). <br>  <br>  If you're concerned about heart palpitations, consult your doctor. He or she may recommend further evaluation such as heart monitoring tests. Seek prompt medical attention if heart palpitations are accompanied by: Dizziness .Shortness of breath .Chest discomfort or pain .Fainting <br>  Take care as always|`|FqrKjtzwaa	There are a lot of possible causes. You really need to see a doctor ASAP.

I will assume it is how to deal  with your constipation and or yeast problem.<br>  <br>  To deal with constipation make sure you are drinking a minimum of 8 glasses of 8 oz's of water a day.<br>  Exercise daily, it can even be as little as walking a mile.<br>  Eat 8 servings of vegetables and one serving of fruit a day-limit the fruit as it is sugary and sugars increase yeast.<br>  Eat no added sugar and limit your carbohydrates to 4 servings a day only.<br>  Drink 3 glasses of skim milk and have 3 protein servings a day.<br>  Avoid the use of antibiotics.<br>  Avoid steroids, like cortisone.<br>  Decrease stress <br>  Sleep 7-8 hr a night<br>  Take probiotics, available in the fridge section of your local health food store and take as recommended.<br>  Take a vitamin and mineral tablet.<br>  Do eat plain yogurt.<br>  Avoid pop and or sugar drinks and juices.<br>  Do try a high fiber drink you can buy in grocery stores like metamucil or prodeim or continue your miralax.<br>  Ask your doctor for a renewal of the creamy medication you were given.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

a11023e02b07df04afc3a46c9b088dfbaa	If you have ruled out STDs, look here:<br>  <br>  From Men's Health Community Forum by Morgannon<br>     <br>  Morgannon <br>  Male <br>  <br>  , Jan 23, 2008 01:55PM<br>  To: All<br>  Prostatitis.  That's what it sounds like you all have.  I have it too, and I regularly experience this pain upon ejaculation.  Also the urinary burning, frequency, urgency, the whole shebang.   <br>  <br>  The bad news is that antibiotics really don't fix it, because something like 90-95% of prostatitis cases are non-bacterial (no one knows why they occur).  The best theory out there is that somehow urine travels back into the spermatic cords and back into the prostate, causing the burning.  But results are inconclusive at best.  You might notice some improvement from the antibiotics, but more than likely it will be temporary at best. <br>  <br>  The good news is that it won't kill you, and you can treat the symptoms.  I have been taking 50 mg of zinc a day, which really seems to have helped the symptoms.  I also try to drink as much water as possible, which does that "tube clearing" thing.  In addition, I take cranberry pills, although I'm not 100% sure if they really help. <br>  <br>  Morgannon <br>  <br>  P.S.  One last thing - check your scrotum during a hot shower.  See if you find anything around the testicles that feels like cords or thick threads.  These are called varicoceles.  They're not going to kill you either, but they can mess with your circulation.  There seems to be some evidence that varicocele can cause prostatitis or vice versa.  So I wouldn't be surprised if you have those too. <br>  <br>  P.P.S.  Just to be on the safe side, make sure you get tested for all STDs.  Then, once you've ruled everything out, you can be fairly confident that you have prostatitis.|`|bimwlw0qaa	go to the doctor|`|LsvPNA2Faa	i wouldnt worry.   <br>  <br>  ur penis is a muscle, its like when you work out a lot ur abdominar or biceps and u get this burning sensation after wards.<br>  <br>  u may ge t that after masturbate.  been a male i dont really worry about the burning sensation of the penis about more of the pain sometime you have to go through when your balls for some reason squeeze it self , it only happens like 2 or 3 times but hell its annoying, it has happeend to all my mates.. prob u too or will<br>  but dont worry mate. just dont masturbate more than 8 times a day lol<br>  <br>  save some protein for the rest of ur body|`|YW9syZpbaa	you might have a bladder infection<br>  <br>  drink alot of cranberry juice<br>  <br>  <br>  i know girls get that more than guys, but guys can get that too, cranberry juice can help.  try that for a week and then if that doesn't work then email again.|`|f0IlPkkTaa	then you probably have a std.|`|Y38ZGHUDaa	u got aids|`|6r3lbJgsaa	YOU HAVE HERPES!!!!!!!!!!

0WHJhEXZaa	From what I read on the reviews about the program from people's personal experience, it doesn't work at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are numerous ways that you can lose weight - Hypnosis, diet, weight loss program and such.<br>  <br>  Do you want to lose weight doing nothing or do you want to lose weight without stopping half way?<br>  Also, there are many myths that most of us still fall into.  Here are a few myths: eating low carb, eating low fat diet, and a few others.<br>  I will demystify them and explain to you.<br>  <br>  Learn here for free: <a href="http://www.LoseWeightNOW.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.LoseWeightNOW.tk</a>|`|SJunThLBaa	If its the 8 Minute Abs video that's on youtube then YES. You'll start seeing results around 2 weeks into it if you do it every day. Although its hard to keep up with the first couple days and you'll sore im telling you now. But if you manage to stay motivated and continue it you'll be pleased with the results.
jhJ6AGkVaa	You are not fat. I am way fatter than that. You should consult your doctor in just in case.
yJSPecgoaa	Do you mean MRSA?  I contracted it in the hospital immediately following major surgery.  I was on oral antibiotics, with frequent hospital stays for IV antibiotics, for about 4 months.<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  My hospital tested me for MRSA prior to my surgery.  The test  result was negative.  I still contracted MRSA in the hospital anyway.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	It's very important to be aware of MRSA and to get tested before you have surgery. The test costs between $10 and $20 and you may have to pay for it since most hospitals/docs do not routinely test for MRSA. Some places are getting better informed but, right now, it is just being realized how serious MRSA is and can be. It's up to the patient to be proactive and get the blood test. You can have MRSA (be a carrier) and not even know it.|`|b485914a06c3effeedd194cd72b67c9aaa	i got a staff infection in my bone  from a surgery  when i was 10 it took 12 surgeries an illiseroff cage around my leg 3 take home ivs and a broken leg that no one knew about for 3 days (i just suffered in silence)  and 4 years to get rid of the damn infection
3f6tFiLGaa	yeah i had the same problem when i was 12 i'd actually cry because it hurt so bad and the adult tooth was growing under it too and i had to go through that pain for months and if anyone tried to pull it out it'd hurt so bad!! so finally my dad took me to the dentist and they gave me like 4 shots to numb it but the shots don't hurt and really the whole thing doesn't hurt and once it was out it felt so good and then my dad left me there without telling me because he had forgot his check book lol. but just go to the dentist it'll feel way better!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|ATSLuU12aa	Heyy i had that same promblem, well it was loose but it wouldn't come out and it was there for months...so i had to go to the dentist..they had to pull it. But it doesn't hurt:)|`|Rc7Gyqj9aa	i usual wait a while and it pops out eventualy, but if you want to get it out right away you can do a couple things. the easiest way is to close you eyes, grab, and pull. you could also take a string of floss, wrap it around your tooth, and take the two ends and pull. if it hurts, you might waant to talk to your dentist. <br>  hope this helped!|`|jhJ6AGkVaa	Tell your dentist if they could do something about it.|`|SAJitWLfaa	I had the same problem times 7. The dentist had them surgically removed. See a dentist.
6olZBGDGaa	it is very likely it is oxycodone. i looked it up on a website called rx list that is used to identify pills and give information on medications. whether you need them or not really depends on the overdosing. i would suggest only taking one or two to keep it safe. if they were prescribed to you try to find the prescription label.
BlMNm9Ccaa	If the tuna was the same quantity that they would put on a 6" sub, that alone is 7 points. I would assume that the veggies were 0 points so I would put you at 7 points. Below is a link showing the point values for subways menu items. Check it out...|`|S2FhDtfSaa	i always guess at the points when info isn't handy. Look at the roll and compare it to a slice of bread. Each slice of bread is 1 point. Your roll was probably 3-4 points. Maybe more if you got a 12". Add another 2 points for enough tuna to make a regular sandwich on a piece of bread.<br>  Veggies are free from points, Just a guess, but I would allow 5 or 6 points for a 6" sandwich and 11 points for a 12" one.
DI3u9gMSaa	Heather, I'll stick it to you right now: get metal braces and forget about Invisalign.  I had crooked teeth and opted for Invisalign.  While I had a good experience, it couldn't move some teeth and now I have traditional braces... and I really like it.  Metal braces is the most effective and will correct your teeth better than Invisalign.  <br>  <br>  Buttons did not hurt my mouth at all.  Pain from wearing Invisalign braces is not even that bad.  My mouth got sore a little but I could still eat.  Braces will hurt much more but it's worth it.  It's worth it.  I get food stuck between the brackets all the time but these are minor annoyances.<br>  <br>  Take the safest route and go with metal braces.  I created an Invisalign site (below) if you want to read about my experience.  Believe me, I had crooked teeth and you could tell by my aligners.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	The thing to remember about teeth is that they readily move and will easily become straight.  The type to use is what is the best buy.  Get some prices on the different systems and then choose the one that feels right to you.<br>  <br>  May I also share with you an answer to a bad breath question I just gave to someone else?  You are right in asking for help with your bad breath, however, the solution is actually very easy if you understand the real cause of bad breath. Up to 90 % of bad breath is caused by bacteria that are on the top of the tongue. These bacteria often appear as "white stuff" on your tongue. This material must be cleaned off in order to get rid of bad breath. Mints and gum just cover up bad breath for a short time, they do nothing to get rid of bad breath. Good oral hygiene is to brush and floss the teeth and then clean the tongue. I use OraBrush tongue cleaner because it is both a brush and scraper. It only costs a few dollars at: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a> It will be the best money you ever spent.<br>  Not having bad breath will give you a great deal of Personal self confidence, just like having straight teeth.  I give you a strong recommendation to get your teeth straightened and also control your bad breath.  You will become a new person.|`|Htv32zN6aa	This is a rather difficult decision.  Here are your options:<br>  <br>  1) Metal braces all have plastic coatings around them, and are good for your teeth, but bad if you get hit in the mouth.  They will cut your lips and gums easily.  <br>  <br>  2) Invisalign are nice, but usually only used for minor corrections.  The are just like wearing the mouth trays you see people use to whiten their teeth.<br>  <br>  3) Usually to have the dentist to align your teeth, they have to remove healthy teeth and it's still a wait and see process.<br>  <br>  My suggestion... your dentist will tell you what the best option is for you.  Not to mention, he will give you pamphlets and have several detailed discussions with you before you ever see the braces :) ... You don't walk in and get them on your teeth!  You have plenty of time!  <br>  <br>  (I would choose metal.)

NEVER EVERYDAY . your muscles need time to heal from all the soreness that will occur in the first few days. take it slow. and never overwork yourself, if you feel tired stop for the day, and pick back up later.<br>  OH! you need a balanced diet and drink lots of fluids to allow eletrolites to flow through....good luck.

pRF5LLloaa	You mom is probably sending you for the Human Papillo Virus shot (HPV), This disease causes cervical cancer in women, and may cause penis cancer in men.  This shot is not for what your are (or are not) doing now, but for what you will be doing after you are married.<br>  <br>  This shot will help prevent you from getting cancer.  Lame or embarrassing is not the question -- staying alive is.  It is MUCH better to be embarrassed but still alive than to be not embarrassed but dead.<br>  <br>  Most shots don't hurt.  The needles are very sharp, and you only THINK you feel something.  To prevent imagining that you are hurt, look in the other direction.|`|e9bf9e6ce8b6f5364d434c119cd4e8b2aa	Gardasil?  It's for cervical cancer.  And while it's well and good that you're going to wait until you're married, but you can still get it from your husband at that time.<br>  <br>  It is a relatively painful shot.  However, it's in the arm.  The second and third actually hurt more than the first.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	It is probably the shot to prevent you from getting cervical cancer. It is a very good idea to get it. Think about stubbing your toe.

You get them over time. The needle going in doesn't hurt, it's the pressure of the medicine going in that does. After wards, the site of the injection might seem a little sore but not too bad<br>  hope i helped :)|`|Rx0ae0suaa	You have three shots, probably over a period of six months. I found that the shot themselves don't hurt, but the first one hurt considerably afterwards - the second and third shots didn't hurt at all.<br>  <br>  You'll probably get the vaccines in your arm.

uC75y83Taa	Does it hurt from inside, like when you breathe in?  If it's bruised on the outside, I don't know what it is.  You should see a doctor.<br>  But if you have pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lungs) your rib cage would hurt terribly everytime you take a deep breath in.  So that would be a lung problem.<br>  You should see your regular doctor to start with. S/He will know if it's possible pneumonia, and/or a pulmonary problem. If it isn't, it shouldn't be hard to diagnose your rib cage problem.  You need to be examined.<br>  <br>  Please make an appt. on Monday. You'll be glad you did. :)

I have never ordered form this company and my Chase Mastercard was billed 34.84 for the month of February and I have never received any product and I am completely baffled as to how they got my CC Number. I hope this helps you. Also, you may try looking for their website and if they are a part of the BBB and what their score is.
NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join. This site has a lot of helpful information and also other people your age that are facing the same challenges that you are experiencing.<br>  <br>  www.sparkteens.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  w8losschick|`|VVSqTdaOaa	You can start seeing results in 2 weeks if you are on the right program|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	probably a while, the best thing to do is run. like 3 times a week. make a schedule so you don't just say "oh i will tomorrow." start out small if you have to, like 10 min. runs, then build up maybe add 2 minutes every week.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	There are many diets out there and exercise regimens, but scientists and doctors keep doing studies that show it doesn't really matter exactly what kind of food you eat, or when you eat it, or what kind of exercise you do - as far as your body is concerned, a calorie is a calorie. <br>  <br>  So the simple answer is, you need to eat less calories, and/or work off more calories - and how you do it doesn't really matter as long as you hit the correct numbers.<br>  <br>  So eat less (if that's easier for you), and exercise more (if that is). Try to do both, but if you enjoy exercise more than dieting, than there is no problem with exercising more and not dieting, though dieting will help.|`|lJhl3wLAaa	Work for 1 pound a week until you leave. So maybe 20 pounds down. Anything more than that and it could be harmful. <br>  <br>  Go to weight watchers or the biggest loser website and get ideas. <br>  Drink lots of water, stop all junk food and fast food. Do cardio 5 times a week and weight training 2 to 3 times per week.|`|Lg6Y8HdZaa	it depends on your bodytype and how hard you work to know how long it will take. you should eat healthy and jog. that's the best way.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	If you can actually apply yourself and do it all the way, P90x, 90 days.|`|AA11474128	hey man if you are serious then u basically have to live in the gym...know how many calories u take in and how may calories you burn. you will lose more weight in the beginning of the diet than at the end. run until u sweat. lift until you cant no more. this will take many months. try below 2000 calories a day <br>  good luck|`|z2TjjnxVaa	Just go running....at your I was the exact same size....I had a somewhat flat stomach, but I just had a larger frame and was a bit muscley.

Sit up, push ups, pull ups (if you can do, not everyone can) and swimming, which works the whole body.|`|yncFd0KMaa	depends how u work it out. if u od on ur body. then it won't take longer than a few months if ur lazy slacker, maybe a a year or 2|`|A7xxJWJPaa	two weeks. go to gym. eat lots of good food(salads) and drink lots of water|`|5rYChsWFaa	First off, there are no quick fixes or easy diet pills that you should be taking.  It all comes down to a proper diet (not a diet but changing your diet) and exercise.  A good start is to figure out how many calories you burn in a day.  A widely accepted standard in figuring this out is the Harris-Benedict formula.  I have included a link below to figure it out.<br>  <br>  You may think this number is way to high but make sure that you take that number and try it out for your activity level.  Now that's what you should be eating to maintain your current weight.  Cutting approximately 200 calories from your diet each day will result in approximately 1 pound of weight loss per week.<br>  <br>  You should, however, not go below 400 calories lower per day, especially if you're working out because you will put your body in starvation mode.  This occurs when your body gets far too many calories and it ends up storing more fat because it feels like it may not get enough food.  When this happens, you're going backwards and just adding on fat.  Many women and many active women that I know have benefited from adding 200 calories to their diet each day because it has been far too low.<br>  <br>  Overall I would say you should focus on eating healthy foods.  Avoid packaged food and processed food.  Try to eat vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats.  You can also track your calories and what you eat at the second link below.<br>  <br>  For working out, you would probably benefit from finding a personal trainer that can make sure you're exercising your overall body and are incorporating weight lifting.  You will be much happier with the results if you incorporate this into your workout routine.  Lifting weights will build muscle, which will increase the number of calories you burn each day, and will make you lose more weight.  Don't worry about "bulking up" as much the opposite will happen as you lose weight.  You should also incorporate some moderate cardio exercise with your workout routine.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Let me know if you have any other questions!<br>  <br>  Jared|`|n32B8HVYaa	I've done a workout program that was the best thing I've ever done in my life, it's called P90X. It's a Video program that helps you choose what you want to do. For Example: Ab Ripper, arms and legs, yoga, and some more. I'm 38 and have gone from 230 to 180, I'm in the best shape of my life. If you want to check it out here it is. P.S. it worked in under 90 days, but you have to be committed to it. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.extremebodyworkout.com/p90x-products/p90x.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.extremebodyworkout.com/p90x-p...</a>|`|ac0c1bca98b77a0a07f2cc59776fb46caa	Anyone can lose weight very easily by changing their diet... you really don't have to exercise to lose weight, but you do need to exercise to tone up your shape ie: Make yourself look sexier...<br>  <br>  To lose weight all you must do is consume less calories. If you wrote down everything you ate in a day and kept a log and then calculated your calories I can guarantee you're probably taking in way over 2500 calories per day... it's very easy to do... a lot of people are consuming close to and sometimes over 4000 calories per day and they don't even realize it!<br>  <br>  Even if you do nothing all day long your body needs approximately 1800 calories just to function, which means just taking in less than 1800 calories per day could cause you to lose weight. Maybe only 1 pound per week, but it adds up. If you want to lose more weight then take in less calories. If you consume 1500 calories a day (for example) and you are used to consuming 3000 calories per day you are going to start dropping weight.<br>  <br>  The idea is to count calories... some people say cut carbs, or cut fat, but you only need to cut calories. However, if you want to look your best then cut out bad calories, like soda pop, chips, fast food, etc.. cut that all out and avoid sugary foods, if you consume sugary foods you can forget losing weight fast, because when you have a lot of sugar in your bloodstream your body can't burn fat efficiently... the extra insulin in your body prevents the use of stored fat as fuel, so beware of that, being on a strict low calorie diet is great and works wonders, but if you throw in a candy bar for a treat you might as well just not bother... it will just ruin all of your hard work.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I have lost a lot of weight in a short time doing this. <br>  <br>  Our main foods are things like:<br>  <br>  Water<br>  Fruit (minimally)<br>  Oatmeal<br>  Veggies<br>  Tuna<br>  Chicken<br>  Brown Rice<br>  Brown Bread (whole grain)<br>  Hard Boiled eggs ( I eat just the white )<br>  <br>  Have what you like, your choice of foods, but try your best to eat lower calorie foods... always have protein with every meal. Avoid extra calorie foods like mayo, butter, etc... <br>  <br>  Realize..... as you do this that you're not being punished for being heavier when you do not eat the yummies that you want, because if you think that way then you will reward yourself with whatever you want and you wont lose any weight... <br>  <br>  Try to think of this as you being in charge and in control and every time you want to give in to snack on something naughty just remember that those thoughts, cravings, feelings are going against your true intentions (of losing weight)... <br>  <br>  Unless your real intentions are to eat whatever you want, in which case you wont succeed.<br>  <br>  And, finally.. the most important point of all.... Do NOT skip breakfast! Eat as soon as you can after you wake up, the sooner the better, this is the KEY to losing weight fast and easily... the quicker you jump start your metabolism in the morning the faster you will begin to burn calories at a higher rate!<br>  <br>  Skipping breakfast is a no-no... think of it like turning the car on in the morning, the longer that engine is running the more gas it is going to burn right?<br>  <br>  So, turn your metabolism on, and fill your body with only the highest nutrition fuel, avoid sweets, white breads, sugary cereals, and salty things and stay as close to whole, and organic that you can, and your body will thank you in a few months.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend went from 210 pounds to 148 pounds in less than 5 months. I went from 200 pounds to 165 in less than 4 months... I still have more to go but it's working great!!! <br>  Just stick with it!!!!<br>  <br>  Losing 2 pounds per week is 8 pounds per month... after 2 months you can drop 16 pounds! After 3 months you'll drop 24 pounds!<br>  <br>  You can do it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA11542483	Not Nutmeg, Mace, the hard shell that coats the nutmeg.  You have to grate it off yourself, and tablespoon will take you hours.  <br>  <br>  Supposedly you have some sort of hallucinogenic high, but my brother tired for several weeks when we were teenagers, and he never got off.  It was hilarious watching him and his friends grate for hours though.|`|7c2bddaa6182384ee6477a0b9cb66f4faa	It's not cinnamon. Don't try it.

This is not coming from an anti-drug crusader, this is coming from someone who condones the use of any drug by someone so long as they take the responsibility on themself.<br>  <br>  First of all, you will not feel the effects for around six hours or more, and the effects have the possibility of lingering for days.  Second, it causes other side effects which make the "high" no fun - dizziness, flushes, dry mouth, accelerated heartbeat, temporary constipation, difficulty in urination, nausea, and panic.  Trust me, it's not a fun thing to do.<br>  <br>  Wikipedia also mentions "A risk in any large-quantity ingestion of nutmeg is the onset of 'nutmeg poisoning', an acute psychiatric disorder marked by thought disorder, a sense of impending doom/death, and agitation. Some cases have resulted in hospitalization."<br>  <br>  All in all, find something else to get your high.  Nutmeg is not something you want to do.|`|Apqri7Tfaa	According to wikipedia, it would take more than a tablespoon to have any effect.

PFghQIq6aa	How does it feel when you eat or brush your teeth? If that hurts, your enamel may be waring thin due to over brushing. That sometimes happens to me when I was little & over brushed. But today the culprit is acidic foods like eating lemons. I love lemons for the sourness of the juice but it is HIGHLY acidic & wears off the enamel of the teeth. If you were to rub your teeth togethether as if you were mad, does it feel like nails on a chalkboard? That's a sign of thinning enamel. Or you could have allergies or sinus infections however slight it may affect you, you could have sensitive teeth & that's where you feel it the most. See a dentist as soon as you can. Good luck. Hope this helps.|`|SAJitWLfaa	I bet its a sinus infection. sounds crazy, I know. If you are blowing out green stuff its a definite.|`|AA12185732	Do you floss and brush regularly???

U61wyMDNaa	Your mom sounds like she has some problems. Talk to her if you can. If she starts to argue, don't say anything too quickly and be calm. Encourage her to join a book club, a gym, a yoga group, church group, school parents thing, or something. I think your mom is living a social life through you instead of getting her own. Encourage her, but maybe you can join something with her to make her more comfortable. Be careful about telling her though, she might be sensitive about that kind of thing. Maybe you can go with your mom to a therapist, counselor, or psychologist. See if they can help the situation. If your mom won't go then go by yourself. You can go to a school counselor too, they cost no money. Maybe your mom is jealous of you somehow. <br>  <br>  I hope your problem gets resolved and I hope everything works out. I wish you the best.  (Oh, and sorry this is really long.)|`|M2xWqSvzaa	Tell her what you just wrote, she might cry, you might cry, but that is what needs to be done.

eFdTrbbnaa	Hello, I am not a Doctor, but, i do work in the medical field. So where do hurt.

So anyway, Tell me what area.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	If your pain is in your groin it could be a pulled groin muscle.  Sometimes this goes away on its own w/lots of rest.  It can also come back.

It's not enough of a problem for me to quit taking it as it's helping more serious issues that I'm having.<br>  <br>  Like another poster said, since all people react to med differently, it's best to talk to your phych about it.  Your symptoms may be related to the med, and it may not be.  If it's not subsiding after a few weeks, I'd get in to see the doctor right away.  You certainly can't deal with that.

U37rt445aa	Well, your IQ won't drop, but your body will start to consume itself. It will first use the fat, then the muscles, then the organs and tissues of your body-- your brain included. Not only will your brain shrink in size, but you won't be able to read because your concentration ability will disappear. Also, you will have no original thought because all your thoughts will be consumed with food obsessions. <br>  Check out the Keyes Study.<br>  You will stunt your brain growth severely.<br>  I do NOT recommend it.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	You are already an idiot !|`|W1xs3vYBaa	If you truly starve yourself you may do permanent damage to your brain. However, that is not necessarily the case. The body is a marvelous thing and with the right psychological attitude and nourishment if can bounce back from life threatening events. <br>  <br>  Still, suicide is not a smart social choice, and starving yourself is more of a way to protest and hurt those around you than actually harming yourself. It will take between 4-8 weeks to die from low caloric intake; however, you will first pass out at which point you will be taken to the hospital. Furthermore, your friends and family will probably notice your severe weight loss and confront you about the issue. Either way, intervention is inevitable unless you go into hiding for a month or two. <br>  Starving yourself to commit suicide is a way to gain attention and punish those around you. It may be easier just to confront those around you with the events that have led you to contemplate suicide.|`|0nLdwZP2aa	The fact that you think committing suicide by not eating is a good idea makes it pretty clear that your IQ is lower than you think it is.  Liking books and hating movies doesn't automatically make you smart.  <br>  <br>  While I also think committing suicide is stupid, period, I get the sense that you are overly proud of your IQ.  Get over yourself and stop posing.<br>  <br>  By the way, starving yourself doesn't often result in lowered IQ - it more generally results in muscle death, heart damage, loss of fertility, brittle bones, and a host of other physical defects.<br>  <br>  Suicide is a serious subject and you shouldn't treat it so lightly.|`|c55O7jqXaa	No I have to agree.

That is not safe or sanitary.|`|ONe2T42Vaa	Everyone is so right, no longer than eight hours, read the back of a tampon box.<br>  <br>  I'll send you five dollars to get a new box girl.|`|vOnzG05Qaa	Are you kidding. That could kill you. You shouldnt leave one in for any more than a few hours. It can cause Toxic Shock Syndrome. Which can be deadly. Not to mention its just plain disgusting|`|c26ifpPDaa	is this a serious question?  if it is yes it is very dangerous.  you will get infections and possibly toxic shock.|`|CX7FtsCMaa	OMG YEESSS , you can go in shock if you leave it in for more than 8 hours not to mention 3 damn DAYS|`|a3bq277Gaa	Omg! Yes! You can get a serious infection that way.|`|wkyNWtfAaa	of course not! tampons are reusable! just soak it in soapy water then put it back in! good luck!|`|jzEo2Qtfaa	Yes, Its very bad.<br>  It can lead to TSS.<br>  which can be fatal.<br>  <br>  Only leave in tampons for 6 hours then change them|`|GTu7pzFYaa	TSS.<br>  It could kill you.|`|nRcSFAxlaa	yea, you aren't supposed to leave them in for more than 8 hours.|`|axsRfcsaaa	It's very bad for you!! I actually forgot a tampon in there for almost 2 weeks! I know that's way more than 3 days but i had painful cramps in my stomach, it was awful. Actually tss is quite rare these days, it's still possible. Makers of the tampons think it was a certain line of extra absorbent tampons that caused tss, since then they've been took off the market. doctors have seen far less cases since they did.|`|Fp9QKY9Saa	i have once left it in for a day but even that can be bad, leaving in a tampon for too long can lead to toxic shock syndrome which can be deadly. If you have a super tampon leave it in for a shorter amount of time because more absorbant tampons can lead to toxic shock syndrome (TSS) faster.|`|K9n9DVEuaa	UH YES! My father's ex girlfriend left her's in for a few days and she got Toxic shock. She had to go to the hospital. That is a trip you DON'T want to take. Not only is it embaressing, it's unhealthy and not very clean or sanitary. Go get pads..at least it's better then nothing..or get more tampons or something. Don't leave it in there!|`|2ZeJubm6aa	i wouldnt do that for many reasons but mainly bc it can probably cause an infection which will cause you to go to the doc n spend even more.. u might wana sell ur comp n go get some tampons or idk ask someone 4 $ or even take a  bunch of toilet paper n put it on the bottum of ur panties or even try to stick it up there but not to high cuz we dont want it to get stuck tthere probly even easier to happen when soaked in blood|`|c5f0312bb68aed3d5380b7bc7ea8b57caa	OMG. You can't be serious. Tampons are sold at dollar stores. I'm sure you can borrow a dollar from someone. If not, use toilet paper and make a "pad". Ugh, leaving a tampon in for three days will cause major infection.|`|mEzFFYhYaa	YES!!!!  It's very dangerous to leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours!!  If youu do, u could get TSS. (Toxic Shock Syndrome).  You could die from this!!|`|68553f5fc959a2eb5b8b4ad452cf20feaa	are you freaking serious?! take it out like right now<br>  ask someone to give you some or grap some paper on your undies but take it out|`|EUDicNqHaa	o my gosh you can get a really bad infection and that can't be good ask a friend or something but don't leave it in 4 that long!!!!!!|`|30SnAm0kaa	read the tampon box. toxic shock syndrome!!|`|fPnWvLv3aa	YES ARE YOU CRAZY|`|be5HPo7Iaa	YES!!! <br>  you could get TSS!!|`|UIK3bZf7aa	umm yes you could get reall reall sick|`|bjqjkDMHaa	YES. Leaving a tampon in for more than a few hours puts you at risk to a very deadly infection called toxic shock syndrome.  hospital treatment for TSS would cost a helluva lot more than one box of tampons.  get over it and get another box, i'm pretty sure you aren't going to want to take that chance just for a measly three dollars.|`|TMb076n6aa	yes it is becuase it can really start to smell. Go to your 1.00 store they have everything for 1.00 including those of your store dont get the pads. it is better then stinking.|`|27e8621704a7c55b0a61c68c284ec23eaa	yes and i hope you are kidding. you can get TSS and/or a very bad infection. don't do it.  that is very unsanitary and causes an overgrowth of bacteria, not to mention  you will leak all over the place. go to the nurse's office at school and get some tampons!|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Please tell mer this is a joke.<br>  You can die from doing that.|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It's definitely not good. Your risk of TSS increases dramatically after 8 hours.|`|SxaxLK02aa	Yeah!! You probably have toxic shock syndrome by now|`|F49y3gImaa	Troll. -_-<br>  <br>  EDIT: the people who are giving me thumbs down are idiots. The tampon will eventually get too full and push itself out little by little. It'd be a bit uncomfortable to leave it in so she would've already needed to pull it out.<br>  <br>  This person is a troll.|`|orwsoUo2aa	OMG are u serious u can die from T.S.S toxic shock syndrom NOT GOOD dig up some change from under the couch or car anything1 or just ask a friend to buy a box !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|C5OfG88Waa	then take a rag or something you can get toxic shock syndrome which can be deadly<br>  plus it stanky|`|B14IhdYTaa	Obviously it is...<br>  <br>  x x x|`|mfc6rzYSaa	no DUH!<br>  It could get infected, and then if you don't take antibiotics you could die of a blood infection.|`|OnzUAVdUaa	OMG yes it is! u cant even leave it in for more than 8 hours! u can get an infection or something if u do.|`|AA10665398	yes!<br>  that's how you get TSS!<br>  tampons shouldn't be left in for more than 4 hours!|`|iy8C03vaaa	yes!!!! that is disgusting...and very unhealthy...change it !!
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you friends are mostly guys and she is a shy girl, she just may not feel comfortable in the company of a bunch of men.  Maybe something happened to her in the past that has her intimidated that you aren't aware of.  If it is girls and guys, and she is cute as a button, the girls might be giving off bad vibes, as girls are jealous and critical of each other.  Maybe the boyfriends of the girls are checking out your chick when you aren't looking and making the girls jealous and vicious with her.  <br>  <br>  When you are alone with her, tell her that you feel she is uncomfortable being around your group of friends and ask her if there is a reason she doesn't want to be our of your sight.  Be really sincere and concerned, not critical, and I am sure she will open up to you about the problem.<br>  <br>  You seem like the kind of guy that every great girl deserves, but you don't want to have to choose between your girl and  your friends.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|68o68mENaa	I teared up a bit there.<br>  You're a really good boyfriend if you're coming on here to ask.<br>  More guys need to be like you.<br>  omg, like seriously.<br>  And your gf sounds super adorable since she's so small!<br>  <br>  But now for the real stuff.<br>  Maybe you can causally bring up to her what she thinks of your friends. And if something is actually wrong with she'll bring it up.<br>  Trust me, girls will always tell if you ask in this kind of situation.<br>  And for your friends, that one is a bit harder.<br>  You don't need to be to sensitive with them.<br>  If you want to go to them first it's best to strait up ask them what's going on and to stop if they're being mean to her.<br>  But you don't need to be super rude or anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
sQta04wnaa	It could be blood and you can buy kits at the pharmacy now to test it.  I think.  AZO can cause this, although you said it made it better so that seems strange.  If you have a fever or lower back pain you need to be seen by your provider.|`|LyE9e6JHaa	This does not sound right to me at all. Is it on the toilet paper when you wipe? There could be something wrong with your kidneys. If it doesn't stop happening in the next few days I suggest you go see your doctor asap.
ea57331baf4a18f47dbbd6f150a03a4faa	God Bless you! I'm sorry you're having to go through this, expecially as a teenager. I'm not a real doc, but what came to my mind was to find someone who could teach you meditation. I know it would be hard, but I was thinking that if you could try to calm down the brain, just calm ... then perhaps you could gain even just a little bit of control over this. You obviously deal with high stress because of this also, but if there are any other stressors, try to let the worry of them go, so they can't affect you so much. Also, just as an added bonus, I don't know how your family is, but truly hugs really help emotionally. God bless you!

ACGBj2liaa	Hi THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT I REPEAT NOT YOUR FAULT, I only had to read the first few sentences, this person is a monster and should be locked up, report him immediately to police, I understand you will feel embarrassed, and rumors may come, but you will save some one else from going through the same thing you have gone through. Do not worry about people hating you, you will be a hero in the eyes of others who you will have saved from this LOWLIFE SCUM.<br>    The staff should also be behind you not saying anything allows this clown to abuse not only you but puts every other boy in DANGER. If I knew where you were I would personally pick you up take you to POLICE and have this person put behind bars then go back and kick the asses of the staff people who choose to say nothing.<br>     Please get help, do not let this monster ruin your life|`|NYOvfc4haa	You should definitely press charges. What he did to you was absolutely unacceptable and that feeling of guilt you've been having is commonly experienced by sexual harassment victims. <br>  <br>  It takes real bravery to be able to risk everything and go after people like that, and guaranteed you will not be the last or only person he will do this to. Speak up for yourself and all his other victims who for many reasons may not have a voice.|`|JRUItDKsaa	Well ask your self this -  Do you want him to continue to do this to other girls?  This is your time to stop being afraid take back your life and do not let him make you scared any more.  Save some other girl from living your experience or worst and press charges asap|`|AA10703634	wow     he got mental problems<br>  you SHOULD press charges against<br>  him. i feel sorry about your situation but <br>  you should have done this long ago
IcAh4pxwaa	Clean and Clear can dry out your face really badly if you have naturally dry skin. You should switch to something like Aquanil, its a lot different than most facial cleaners but once you get used to it, you'll love it. You might be able to find it at walgreens but i know it got it at my hospitals pharmacy..but its not prescription. Don't pay attention to the lame bottle and just give it a try! <br>  Also you could try a daily moisturizer such as neutrogena..use with with spf for even healthier skin. <br>  Using both of these as often as possible should defiantly help you out!|`|hkw4LbARaa	Drink more water and moisturize your face.
50c48696b7488dc525798f3a4b51347daa	I am a therapist and I for me it is caring for people at the same time, I do have to make a living for my family.  It is hard for people to accept that they need to pay for my services because we as therapists do give so much of ourselves for free that our work is not as valued monetarily as say a veterinarian.<br>  <br>  Sorry, a pet peeve as I have a very small private practice and am barely making ends meet.|`|l7g5JBEEaa	most therapists have a world of problems themselves and find a huge interest in helping others solve their problems.  I would not say it is the money since a psychologist doesn't really make an astronomical amount.  Psychiatry however is a different subject.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	Some do it for the money, and some do it because they empathize with patients and truly care....And some might like both....good money and the opportunity to help.|`|d92m1ARbaa	Since I'd like to be one, I'm only interested in helping people. To say this better, what interests me is to find a solution of the problem, thus helping the patient. However, there are people out there (as usual) that are money motivated, but only in this field. In fact, those people are just in every field you can imagine.|`|ypGzS34aaa	Many of us get a thrill from doing what we like to do.  There is a very rewarding feeling knowing that you can talk to people and offer them ways to feel better about themselves and find a better direction in life.  Trust me, the money isn't much considering all the costs that go into education, insurance, billing, staff, rent.|`|y2Uks58paa	im sure some do it for the money and some do it for their love of helping people, just like in any other career .
hD25pT1Laa	Those colors and pinpricks are called phosphenes. They are a normal phenomenon caused by the visual components producing signals in response to something besides light. Pressing lightly on your eyeballs with your eyes closed really gets them going.<br>  <br>  I guess this means that even without light your eyes can still be working.|`|rPFQ3Bfiaa	well, i have no clue about your Q. but i guess is a aging thing, if not than your working too hard at times and that thing just hit you like that!|`|T0fwqL2baa	Your eyes continue working for as long as you are awake...your eyelids are a thin "membrane" that shields them, thin enough to allow light thru...that's what you "see".
i0y3CYoHaa	Have you tried Playtex light tampons? There's a lot of kinds that have small, smooth applicators. I started wearing mine at 12, and I was fine. Just make sure you relax when you get it in, and throw out the applicator. You might want to try it the day before to be sure.<br>  <br>  Worst case scenario, wear one of those skinnier pads in your swimsuit for the waiting around part, and rush to the bathroom as soon as you can after. Sort of gross, but it won't leak if it's a company like Always that locks it in.|`|o0Badlndaa	Young lady it is time to grow up use the small tampons .... cant you talk to your mother or don't you have a close girl friend who uses them ...there is nothing to fear realllly ....|`|m6jE5KVUaa	use a tampon and just go swimming! it will be OK...you are not the first!|`|721cb05b6c1e188e641c62b435f765c9aa	yes....swimming is no problem but i would still wear a tampon....lots of phyiscial activity can sometimes make you bleed more...especially if it is close to the end..|`|Akmdvhv6aa	yes u can swim|`|BpTlXUj9aa	it's up too u|`|l0opvMfGaa	u should wear whisper pads for ur safety n not to leak|`|Kqc5Qfbraa	yeah, you can still swim<br>  its only a little bit that comes out anyway and in a pool that's nothing.<br>  if your waiting around for a little bit try changing just before you go in, you'll probably be alright but just incase<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|jPnhpmhsaa	Don't rush wait till it really dried.|`|68o68mENaa	You might be ok, but I suggest wearing those small Tampax Perl tampons just in case.<br>  We don't want any accidents.|`|6hx1pW9Oaa	Tampons are your best bet, better safe than sorry.. dont worry they dont hurt.|`|Ol7dFDjPaa	if its only a lil bit i would <br>  u should try tampons though u dont feel them
i05dLLeRaa	You should not work our the same muscle group back to back. Working out breaks down the muscle and then it builds itself back bigger and stronger. If you do not give it rest, you do not give it time to rebuild properly. <br>  <br>  There is such a thing as over training and that is what you would be doing. <br>  <br>  My split looks like this: <br>  <br>  day 1, Chest and Triceps<br>  day 2, Back and Biceps<br>  day 3, legs and shoulders<br>  <br>  Then I start back with Chest and Biceps again. <br>  <br>  You can do abs and calves everyday.|`|6aJn2Gjuaa	when you work a muscle hard you tear the fibres inside the muscle and they repair themselves thicker and stronger. So in other words it makes the muscle get bigger. So if you work them before they have healed they cannot get bigger.<br>  It takes on average 48 hours or 2 days for this to happen,sometimes it can be longer . <br>  So to get the best results you must only work your chest every second day .|`|K1aT1i8caa	mm not a good idea if ur only 10 years old<br>  but i get the feeling ur not so..........<br>  try doing 20 push-ups with 25-pounds on ur back<br>  if u can do 20 of those then start benching<br>  to build, go high-weight low reps<br>  and go 4 days a week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  and try not to hurt urself
kivwSfpgaa	yup. when you life weights or do situps, its actually breaking down the muscles in which you are targeting. Then they build back up stronger. <br>  <br>  shakiness right after is a sign of a good, hard workout :)
Nt7exGYAaa	The body goes a little crazy during menopause and those nights sweats are an absolute nightmare, believe me I've been through it.<br>  <br>  To me this just sounds like a little hormonal pimple and if it's cleared up now there shouldn't be any problems. I had a few of them going through menopause.<br>  <br>  If she's having problems with menopause issues, perhaps it would be a good idea to go onto a natural HRT.<br>  <br>  When I started menopause I was very reluctant to go onto HRT because there's breast cancer in my family history.  <br>  <br>  In the end the night sweats and hot flushes got the better of me and I tried, tablets that were prescribed by a doctor, over the counter, and patches.  <br>  <br>  Finally found a natural HRT and have now been on it for a few years and it's brilliant, no side affects at all either and better still no more of those night sweats or flushes.|`|Sozc3MyFaa	If it is in a circle around the nipple in the dark part, these are not pimples, they are small glands that lubricate the nipple (for nursing) but even women with out children have them.

Doing them PROPERLY will result in the best gains, so don't worry about that. ^_^|`|o5HQIKhnaa	Yes it does, but dont put to much stress on them or else it could hurt them too, my legs are very very strong i can squat about 450 but im a little guy my joints can handle that weight so after a couple months of doing that weight my joints were in terrible pain so just be careful your not using to much weight than you can handle|`|hLQa3VtYaa	joints arent muscles...soo no|`|kOoCya9Oaa	No,that will deteriorate them.

One on the right side and one on the left. Even if one becomes damaged as long as the other one is in good shape you should still be able to become pregnant. If a ovary becomes damaged or a tube your chances of a tubal pregnancy rise. What ever is causing you to get hit needs to stop. Not only can your ovary become damaged but other organs can also become damaged and may become life threating. No your child would not end up mentally ill from a damaged ovary. If someone is hurting you report it to a trusted adult or if you  have to report it to the police yourself.

It is easier if you start on Sunday though.|`|6uPu0DXNaa	Okay, I know this haha... I just started BC last week. You can either take it today or THIS sunday. :)<br>  I would start it this sunday though because it seems like that's how your pack wants it to be :P|`|2cC2vyxBaa	Once you get your period you should start at the beginning of the pack which is the red one. In the packs of birth control I have you have a instruction booklet and on the last page is stickers with a list of days so you can follow that. Sunday I believe is the protocol that they recommend you to start your pills so it is the beginning of the week. If you are concerned about possibly becoming pregnant over spring break by not being fully protected from birth control then I suggest using condoms as a precaution. Most birth control it is recommended that you be taking it for a week before you use no other contraceptive. Hope that helps.|`|Mhdv5NDKaa	I would take the first pill on Sunday.  It not only makes it more even, but once you get regulated on the pill, your periods will most likely not be on the weekends which is great!  As for spring break, depending on when yours is, two days probably won't make much of a difference.  You should still use another form of protection along with the pill.
cWgfavyTaa	why 8 g of protein? and why soy protein?<br>  <br>  whey is 100x times better|`|IA4x5oPMaa	sounds good|`|And9dyrwaa	nice keep it up.
TVzA5WE8aa	Yes. I have been on a high fiber diet for over 2 years. I am still passing gas very often throughout the day. It is very normal for a human being to pass gas due to high fiber intake. If you do not pass gas, you should seek for a professional right away. Our large intestine's bacteria are good for us for lowering blood cholesterol by binding bile out of the feces and to prevent cardiovascular diseases and many other diseases. Thus, fiber is consider an undigested product so while the bacteria company them, they will develop gas.<br>  <br>  Remember not to hold gas in when you have them, because if you do, results are cramping, abnormal pain and etc in 20 minutes to 30 minutes. These kind of symptoms will last few hours.

bmWKETgWaa	Your body is telling you, "Don't delay!  Quit now!  Now!!"<br>  <br>  The sooner you quit, cold turkey, the sooner your lungs will start to heal.  They really will get better!<br>  <br>  I quit, after smoking for about four years in my early twenties.  What helped was getting married to a non-smoker, and moving away to a new home where most of the usual cues and triggers to light up were no longer present.  My new husband was supportive and patient. <br>  <br>  Air out your home, put away the ash trays and the cigarettes, and replace the automatic times you light up with other habits.  You may change these new habits as time goes on -- no more gum, but brushing your teeth or washing the dishes, for example.<br>  <br>  Even after the physical effects of smoking have cleared from your body, you have to beware of the social triggers.  Years after I'd stopped smoking, I attended the funeral of a lady who had smoked all her life, and had actually died of lung cancer.  Her grown children all still smoked.  After the service, everybody's nerves were on edge, and the cigarettes came out.  When I was offered one out of politeness, darned if I didn't come within an ace of accepting it!  Very fortunately, sanity prevailed.

There are general health tests you should do.  In my case I was told it was stress, I don't know if it was.  It still happens to my very rarely when my breathing gets out of sync.|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	u have ruined your life|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	I can't believe that nobody is giving you encouragement.  First, being 20 years old, it is VERY unlikely that you have emphysema.  By dad has smoked over 60 years and has a mild case of it.  <br>  <br>  Next,  I once had the same symptoms you're having and I went to the emergency room, and they told me that I still had 70% lung capacity, so I wasn't in any danger at all.  It just feels like it's hard to get air in.    If you can get to an emergency room, it might be a good idea.  They will hook up a little machine and you breathe something in, and your breathing is completely restored in like 5 seconds.  <br>  <br>  Last - this could be some sort of minor allergic reaction to something.  There are natural allergens and man-made  chemicals all over the place.  I've even had a reaction to Febreze.    You are more than likely perfectly fine.  So, get to an emergency room if you can.  Then, when you can make an appointment, get checked out by a doctor.|`|wdz5RMaeaa	Well, with emphasyma,  you would noy be getting enough oxygen and would experience that in other ways, Doubt that is it unless you mine coal or do insulation work.  My mom got it after 50 years smoking.<br>  <br>  I have felt what you are talking about though. You are not being able to use the residual air in your lungs. You can never breathe out all the air or you you have a lung collapse. However it sonds like you may not be getting then a healthy balanced exchange of the chemicals in air.<br>  <br>  When I went to the doc, they gave me an inhaler I believe with some steroids, to help the breathing. Not exactly sure what was going on, but it was like asthma on a short term basis. Something in the air? Something in my ability to exchange the air or fight OFF what was affecting me. Inhaler helped alot.

It is yoga based but they added in other exercises, there are some really good movements that strengthen your lower body and increase your balance.

It could be life threatening and you need to know.|`|arfdXyy7aa	It causes you to catch your breath, and you try not to breathe in or breathe out too much because it’s extremely painful either way. You take short, staggered breaths and try not to move. Finally, you work up the courage to take a sharp inhale or exhale. You feel a sensation similar to a bubble bursting and the pain is gone. <br>  <br>  What is this strange sensation that is so painful and uncomfortable? It is actually a very common condition and most people have experienced it. The medical term for this occurrence is Precordial Catch Syndrome. <br>  <br>  <br>  Many people mistakenly believe that they are having a heart attack at the onset of this type of pain. While the pain is strong and located in an area that would seem like the heart, this condition is not a heart attack, nor is it heart related. <br>  <br>  Precordial Catch Syndrome (PCS) is the most common cause of recurring chest pain. It is also sometimes known as “a stitch in the side” or “Texidor’s twinge”. It occurs most often in children and teenagers, but does persist into adulthood as well. The pain occurs just under the left nipple, near where you feel the heart beat most strongly on the front of the chest, and comes on very suddenly. <br>  <br>  This extremely sharp pain causes a person to not want to move or breathe. This is where the “catch” part of the name is derived. Any movement or breathing only seems to intensify the pain. The pain usually lasts for around 30 seconds to 1 minute before disappearing. Sometimes the pain will suddenly disappear upon taking a strong breath or moving suddenly as well. This can almost feel like a pop of an imaginary bubble.  After the pain is gone, there is usually a dull ache that lingers. <br>  <br>  These onsets of pain can occur frequently, sometimes several times a day, and can occur when exercising, resting, or when in virtually any other state. Doctors have not been able to correlate PCS with any particular triggers, such as heavy activity or the like. However, there are some doctors that believe things like heavy or irregular breathing or even posture could play some type of role in bringing about an episode of PCS. <br>  <br>  At this time, doctors and researchers do not know what causes the pain associated with PCS. The most accepted theory is that the pain is the result of a pinched nerve somewhere. Due to the fact that the onsets of PCS are so quick and disappear just as quickly, it’s hard for doctors to actually see the condition in action. <br>  <br>  While doctors aren’t sure of the actual causes, they are sure that it poses no danger. They believe it to be a completely benign condition and is most certainly not cause for alarm. For this reason, there is not a lot of information or studies regarding the physical cause of PCS available. Doctors feel no need to intensify study of something they know to be only a minor inconvenience. <br>  <br>  The only real worry is that sometimes, what seemed like PCS, could possibly turn out to be something more serious. The following are signs of more concerning illness: <br>  <br>  - Chest pain that extends into the left side of the jaw or arm <br>  - Chest pain that a person describes as a “heavy” feeling <br>  - Pain that does not improve at least a little after 24 hours of regular doses of ibuprofen <br>  - Fever <br>  - Cough, especially a cough that produces phlegm ("flem," or “flame") <br>  - Extreme anxiety with the pain or a feeling of “impending doom” <br>  - Blueness or paleness of the lips or fingernails <br>  - An irregular, rapid, or pounding heart rate <br>  - Marked difficulty breathing or catching one’s breath (different from mild pain with breathing)<br>  <br>  If any of these occur, please be sure to call your doctor’s office right away. These could be indications of a more serious and potentially threatening condition. <br>  <br>  People experiencing PCS need no particular treatment at all. Usually, just the reassurance that they aren’t having something dangerous happening is all that they need to hear to set their minds at ease. PCS should not interfere with normal activity, and there’s no reason to use any form of medication. <br>  <br>  If you are experiencing PCS, it may be worth a visit to the doctor just to go over the symptoms to be sure that it is not a different condition that could be more serious. Doctors can easily tell the difference between a serious heart condition and Precordial Catch Syndrome just by talking with the patient, and doing a physical examination. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you can rest assured that your extremely painful, stabbing feeling is completely normal and only a minor inconvenience. And remember, the key to getting rid of the pain quickly is to just work up the courage to take that deep breath, scream in pain, and be done with it.

wwRbkCMraa	First... EAT, EAT, EAT!!  I was able to go from 135 lbs to 175 lbs in one summer. I ate like a horse, made sure I ate at least 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, and I used Mike Mentzer High Intensity training routines (AKA heavy duty).<br>  <br>  Here is a youtube clip of one of the routines. clip is kinda boring, but gets the point across<br>  <br>  Part 1<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqR0-ndcNwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqR0-ndcN...</a><br>  part 2<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygRRZmDv88" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygRRZmDv...</a><br>  part 3<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J6ahkf9ydQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J6ahkf9y...</a><br>  <br>  Now here is my whey protein schedule<br>  <br>  Right out of bed 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  Immediately after workout 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  Right before bed 50 gram shake/smoothie<br>  <br>  Then sometimes if I wake up in the middle of the night, I will go to the kitchen and have another 50 gram shake/smoothie.<br>  <br>  This blows up recovery and puts the mass on quick!<br>  <br>  Here is a protein link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here is a WICKED whey protein gainer smoothie video<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriecC0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriec...</a><br>  <br>  Try and eat a  couple of these mega gainer smoothies per day in addition to your normal diet and your sure to gain!!!|`|XjXSJynVaa	if you want some good exercises go to www.bodybuilding.com and click on Supersite, then look to your left and under Supersite click on Exercises, then click on the muscle that you want to work on.<br>  PLEASE NOTE that there are some certain exercises that can damage your growth spurt. for example: bench pressing can damage your growth spurt.<br>  Oh and to gain even more muscles drink a protein shake 30 minutes after your workout
fL6jNee5aa	Ideally your plate is supposed to be 1/2 vegetables, 1/4th protein and 1/4th carb.<br>  Try introducing new vegetables slowly or putting sauces on them (having a little bit of sauce on vegetables is better than not having any vegetables at all).<br>   Try sneaking them into pasta sauces, soups and rice, cut them up so small that you can hardly tell that they are there, or puree them.<br>  There are so many things you can do with veggies! try zucchini boats, honey carrots, peppers, peanut butter and celery, salads, green beans.<br>  They have really good frozen veggie mixes that you can buy at any grocery store, they're just as healthy as fresh veggies.|`|B12E4rYiaa	it's always good to eat more veggies and fruits especially if you're trying to lose weight they have less calories that other food is why. They are good fiber as well which helps you stay full longer.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Carrots, corn, green beans, and sweet potatoes would be good to add to your meals.|`|uCxYdyQXaa	Try curry?

You can buy ranch dressing mix (it comes in a small packet) and on the back they show you a way to make it fat free...it is super easy you just poor the mix into fat free sour cream, mix and fridge. I used to snack on this when I got home because I was always so hungry that I would eat to much. <br>  <br>  There also are some great stir fries in the freezer section and that will allow you to try different types of vegetables. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|yye1VeaWaa	you cant just focus on one veggie u need variety or you will get bored of what your eating plus most veggies have different nutritional values like for example tomatoes have  lycopene and carrots have Vitamin A. and if you dont think your getting enough veggies or fruits take daily vitamins.|`|z9nCUpaOaa	Anytime you can get more vegetables into your diet is a good idea.|`|ejLdm1cpaa	My favorite thing to do is buy the frozen veggies in the grocery, nuke them in the microwave and add marinara sauce and parmesan. It's much healthier than pasta would be under the marinara, and it tastes just as good. Frozen vegetables get a bad rep, but in all reality they are just as healthy, last longer, and are much cheaper than seasonal vegetables. Plus there is a huge variety that makes it easy to pick, and simple to prepare. Hopefully you can show your family a few new ways to incorporate vegetables into their diet as well :)
ICHzrALJaa	A miscarriage is a very premature birth.When a pregnancy is not viable, the uterus begins to contract and usually empties itself completely. Blood loss during early pregnancy is the most common symptom of miscarriage. depending on the amount of bleeding and discomfort you may be admitted to the hospital or allowed home. If the scan shows that there is no blood clot or tissue in the womb then nothing further needs to be done. If there is more than just a little tissue or a blood clot then a small operation called a uterine evacuation may be recommended.|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	It definitely sounds like a miscarriage, i have seen several as a paramedic.  A doctor should definitely be seen after a miscarriage. You lose a lot of blood, and sometimes continue bleeding for a while. If you don't go to the doctor, there is the possibility of losing too much blood or getting a really bad infection. Normally the doctor will make sure that all the tissue has been expelled, and will give IV fluids and possible blood to support the patient's blood pressure. Your friend is fine if it has been a long time.|`|TJUEaum0aa	This is not necessarily a miscarriage.  Was her period on time?  If not, how late was it?  Did she already suspect that she was pregnant?  During menstruation, the lining of the uterus "sheds," and this could very well have been the "little thing" that she saw.  It could have been a clot.  Also, if she was not far along enough to even suspect that she was pregnant, the embryo would have been too small to even see anyway. <br>  But anyway, yes, if you have a miscarriage or suspect that you had a miscarriage you should really see a doctor.

If you don't have canned fruit with HEAVY SYRUP go buy some peaches. Then, when he stops vomiting and thinks he is hungry....give him the BRAT diet for at least 12 hours.

I find it particularly alarming that teens are becoming type two. I've been telling anyone who will listen, that it's a diet related issue. I get a lot of resistance from the old school who insists that it's hereditary (primarily), and obesity (secondarily). I say, those are merely contributors. It's most certainly the diet, Mike. It becomes clearer and clearer to me as I study this each day. I'm sure it will become clear to you as you pursue this as well.<br>  <br>  As far as your chances of becoming type one, I suppose it's possible. Some who are initially diagnosed as type two later find out that it was misdiagnosed. Those are usually referred to as type 1.5 or LADA. The only way to know for sure is with a C-peptide test and GAD test. Here's what your doctor might do to eliminate T1 as a possibility:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_auto...</a><br>  <br>  If you want to relieve your concerns, see if you had the symptoms of "metabolic syndrome" prior to finding out you were type two. Based on your success with diet and exercise, and if the oral med you're taking is Metformin (Glucophage), I would say that the chances of you becoming type one are very small. <br>  <br>  Interesting that you were a personal trainer. I'm seriously considering getting into the fitness business. What better way to help people avoid this disease?|`|iK3YYRaTaa	I think if you were Type 1 , you would be dead by now. You are type 2. I bet you were a little fat. Now tell the truth. And yes Type 2 diabetes is striking people younger and younger. It really is a epidemic. It will come to this one day. Parents that have an overweight child will be charged with child abuse. I am not kidding.

The key is to control your HA1Cs and to have them checked regularly. This is a very manageable condition if you are careful and vigilant like many are.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	One question. Did you have a viral infection in the months before you were diagnosed? If the answer is yes, then you may very well be type 1. There has been a 30% increase ever since 1990 in the number of young adults diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Although I have not talked to that many type 1 diabetics in my life, either IRL or online, every single one of them had had a viral infection, often with a high fever, in the months before they were diagnosed. I had roseola, caused by a virus, in November, 1954. My pediatrician confirmed my mother's diagnosis of diabetes in May, 1955. I was 26 months old.|`|e241bb5ca60328ab4d08ef938b8dfe20aa	You could be type 2.  Not everybody who is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is "old" or overweight (I'm proof of that).  There is a blood test to determine if you have an antibody which would indicate if you're actually type 1 (or at risk for it - something like that).<br>  <br>  I've heard that you can wear out your pancreas by having high blood sugars for too long, but my endocrinologist told me that that's an old wive's tale.

7Yzgoowkaa	woman on top position is pleasurable for men, since he can see boobs bouncing, touch them and have to simply lie down and not do anything. Women gets pleasure only if there clitoris is pressed or by other stimulations. That you can try while laying on your back on a bed corner or box, with your legs folded up and him standing and doing it. This way he can see you, have deep penetration, good strokes, no bending on knees required and women is also comfortably lying. You can ask him to caress your breast with one hand and simultaneously stimulate your clitoris with other hand. This will definitely help you reach orgasm. The other way round is to do 69.|`|K9n9DVEuaa	My man and I had a slight issue too. he can't do much because of his knees, they pop out of place if he bends them really. So I'm ALWAYS on top and it starts to get OLD!...He recently got this ring that is a vibrator and he puts it on his penis and you have sex with it vibrating so that it makes it a LOT more pleasurable. It only costs $4 with the condom. Or if your just possibly tired of being on top, you could go out and buy some *toys* and go down on eachother and do kind of a tease to climax and then have penitration sex. Looking up positions can be another way to cure to the issue.|`|c26ifpPDaa	yeah i don't get much pleasure from it either.  what helps me is to turn around.  like my back facing him instead of face to face.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	When you are riding him you have your hands free, don't you?

It is EXACTLY the same just in a different place, so if he goes down on you, you can then get genital herpes. it can of course also be transferred to your mouth|`|XzV4bUeFaa	No do not kiss anyone w/cold sores.

There is an episode of Dr. G Medical Examiner (this is real not like CSI) where a woman was kissed by a stranger in a bar.  She got simple 'mouth herpes' but it spread through her system and she died.  Search Google for Dr. G Medical Examiner "Kiss of Death"..  That is the worst, but a highly unlikely scenario.

Because if he has, then he must get out breaks often, or maybe once in awhile?<br>  Chances are if you kiss him while he has it. You will end up getting herpes. It wont be gential or anything, as long as you DONT let him go down on you. Or as long as you do not do anything sexually oral while you have one.<br>  <br>  If I would you, I would just not kiss him. You really dont want to get that.

For example, if you've been sitting in a hotboxed van with 6 people smoking blunts every day for the past month, there is a strong chance it will show up in your system.

Everything. That is the only way with a hair test, and then they will get you for shaving. <br>  The method I have seen work for other people who have tests very soon after smoking is to drink two shots of white vinegar followed by a gallon of water the night before the test. Pee in the morning before going for the test, and don't drink anything acidic (tea, coffee, soda) after drinking the two shots until after the test. That is for a pee test.|`|mrSYSSPgaa	If your not a frequent smoker its probably out of your system already.  If your worried drink plenty of water and take plenty of bathroom trips.

Drug tests are designed to detect traces of drugs in your body. This is a chemical test, so unless you wait until the drugs are out of your system, and your hair (yes, drug traces remain in your hair follicles) it's impossible to pass. Different drugs take different amounts of time to get out of your system. The only way you can trick a test is to drink lots and lots of water, but this too is detectable, and if they notice you have a lot of water in your urine, they will retest you. Basically, stop doing drugs.|`|gH5FPXURaa	listen listen .....its so simple all u have to do is one of 2 things.....1 be lazy and go to local nutrition store(GNC) dont be cheap spent some money and buy the drink  ..2 u said u havent smoked in 2 weeks.....so ur system is almost clean...drink a minumum of 10 big glasses of water every day and most importand u have to do some activity to make you sweat bullets and i mean dripping sweat...if u drink all that water and sweat your *** off u should be fine.....ohh yea the drink worked for me and i smoked the day b4|`|wObc6GKqaa	your kidding me, why do you alll smoke.

You are thinking right.  Getting more physically active will help.  Hoola Hoop, jump rope, and weights are a great start.  The jump rope and Hoola Hoop will help you burn those calories.  You burn the most calories in the 2 hours following cardio workout.  Using weights builds muscle.  Muscle uses more calories, so the more muscle you have, the more calories you burn.<br>  <br>  Now, let's get to the nutrition side of it.  Go online and see what your nutrition plan should look like.  Don't start eating just salad and fruit.  Those are just carbohydrates.  The body metabolizes carbohydrates quickly, so you are more likely to be hungry sooner.  Every meal should include carbohydrates, lean protein, and unsaturated fat.  To build those calorie-burning muscles, you need protein.  There are plenty of low-calorie protein options.  Egg whites, string cheese, beans, and fish.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Learning to manage a healthy diet and physical activity will lead to a longer, healthier life.  Be sure to get plenty of rest and drink lots of water.

Anorexics are known to lose weight til they have congestive heart failure, My psych teacher told me a story about a girl that They couldn't feed her intravenously (via IV) because she was so skinny that all her veins were basically thread, and they couldn't get an IV in her arm at all, and she died when she was 21.<br>  <br>  Bulimia after a long period of time can ruin the lining of your esophagus, and it will slowly break away the enamel on your teeth and make you more prone to cavities. <br>  <br>  Also, if you want children someday, Bulimia and Anorexia can lead to reproductive problems and you could completely stop having your period, and lose your ability to have children. <br>  <br>  I suggest talking to your family doctor, or a health/gym teacher at your school. They can provide you with many diets that are healthy for you and will help you lose weight. I don't know much about your current weight, or height, because those are both factors to take into consideration when going on a diet, so I'm sorry but this all the advice I can give you. I highly recommend talking to your family doctor.

It's normal.<br>  <br>  However, it's supposed to wear off as you wake up. Sometimes people with narcolepsy have things like that happen to them all the time. <br>  <br>  Sleep paralysis, while weird and creepy, will not harm you in any way.

0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	It sounds as if you are experiencing the classic symptoms of depression. As much as your happiness  means to your parents (and I'd guess it means almost everything), it would take second place to your health; and that's EXACTLY what we're talking about. This has nothing to do with all your parents have done for you. In fact if you were feeling better I'm sure you'd realize that. It sounds as if you have no better allies than your parents-something that's true even for the oldest of us. Think about how happy you'll all be when you manage to beat this together. I have suffered, and I have found help.|`|AA10493307	We all have different thresholds of confidence.  They are constantly adjusted throughout our lifetime.  <br>  <br>  Feeling weak, sleeping, and gaining weight are not necessarily markers for depression.  Of course, thinking about ending it is a marker for depression.  <br>  <br>  If the weight gain is the cause of the depression, then weight loss would be something to pursue.  The best weight loss plan I have seen is the Doctor Rosedale Diet.  It works quickly.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4820798_extinguish-depression.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4820798_extingui...</a>|`|XEvK4urxaa	i sent you an email :)|`|K0FabRAIaa	I think you should tell them now.

Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in your brain.  Secondly, if your parents love you and have raised you and your brother well, as you say, then you are depriving them of their privilege of guiding you, comforting you and helping you.  They would feel much worse if you got sick from your depression than they will feel if you just come forward and be honest with them.  Trust me, I know.  I have been diagnosed with severe depression in my life and I am a mother and I know that I would want my children to come to me with this sort of thing.

And they will want to help because they want you to be happy.  Of course they have problems of their own.  Everybody does.  But you're not a problem; you're their daughter.<br>  <br>  I have an anxiety disorder, and I was afraid to tell my family too.  Like you, I thought I would be just another problem, but you know what?  Love is stronger than problems.<br>  <br>  You'll get through this, and so will your parents.  The first step to getting better is to tell them.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I'll pray for you.

BmGQwutqaa	Your body-mass index ("BMI") measures your height/weight ratio. It is your weight in kilograms divided by the square of your height in meters. <br>  <br>  For instance, if your height is 1.82 meters, the divisor of the calculation will be (1.82 * 1.82) = 3.3124. If you weigh 70.5 kilograms, then your BMI is 21.3 (70.5 / 3.3124). <br>  <br>  People with BMIs between 19 and 22 live longest. Death rates are noticeably higher for people with indexes 25 and above. (5/1/2001: The U.S. government recently changed these ranges to a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 24. I encourage you to take these numbers with a grain of salt; they are not as accurate as they sound.) <br>  <br>  To get it right u need to first convert the feet and pounds to meters and kilo's and then to the math .<br>  <br>  BMI Categories: <br>  <br>  Underweight = <18.5 <br>  Normal weight = 18.5-24.9 <br>  Overweight = 25-29.9 <br>  Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater|`|7swefA6Paa	no offense but you are HUGE.  my weight range (at 5'5") is 103-150lbs.  you are definitely overweight.|`|iW80AcLgaa	you're alright..i don't like em so skinny...nice to have some junk|`|85KL0eUUaa	you're almost obese for your age<br>  BMIs for a 14 year old teenager-<br>  underweight: less than 15.8<br>  healthy weight: 15.8-23.4<br>  overweight: 23.4-27.2<br>  obese: 27.3+<br>  your bmi is 26.6 so you are already overweight and are borderline obese.|`|75ae4dd030c983bd678c722ce696f017aa	check out this website and calculate your BMI.

If you exercise quite a bit, you could weigh that much due to muscle mass, so you wouldn't be overweight at all. But, if you exercise a normal amount/don't have much muscle mass, then the ideal body weight for your height might be 118-155lbs. Keep in mind this "ideal" doesn't factor in your frame size or your muscle mass.<br>  <br>  The most accurate measurement would be your body fat percentage. This can be a bit hard to do at home, unless you have a set of calipers.<br>  <br>  If your school has a health teacher you trust, or a PE teacher/nurse you trust, try talking to him/her about checking your body fat percentage. They might have the tools needed to check.

Fruits and vegetables are more easily broken down by the body than other processed foods. When you eat them last, they ferment before what you ate first and are left creating gas inside your intestine, waiting for the other food to break down. If you eat your fruits/vegetables first, they're able to ferment first and clear your intestine for the other foods that needs to be digested without blocking anything. Also, you might want to eat more yogurt. It contains proteins that help aid in digestion.|`|cSBIHBSfaa	beans and/or nuts. it's natural to fart a lot really. but another possible factor is an allergy, it happened to me once. can u be a bit more descriptive with your question though? like, i don't know what you've been consuming nor what you've been in contact with that may be causing this problem. all of which i've mentioned are all possible factors towards why you are farting so much...|`|eIQ5T2amaa	Ummm...

Masturbation Weight Loss is not about calories counts and food restrictions. It’s about having fun. These five tips are the easiest and most pleasant way to lose weight and also to reduce stress.<br>  <br>  1. Strip naked, pull the bedcovers down, lie down then recall in detail for 5 minutes the best time you had great sex. You concentration on your fantasy (as well as your growing sexual excitement) will distract you from thoughts of food. And raise your metabolism, too.<br>  <br>  2. Perhaps, begin to masturbate, perhaps to an orgasm that leaves your body totally unaware of and unconcerned about food. Sip cold water as you calm down.<br>  <br>  3. Perhaps, with or without masturbation or orgasm, take a nap. Upon awakening, brush your teeth well, to provide the taste buds with a non-food treat. Follow this with a non-caloric drink if you like.<br>  <br>  4. Fully dressed, put on a x-rated video while watching from the couch or bed. Perhaps you’ll strip, get a vibrator, masturbate, reach orgasm, nap perhaps none of that. At least, you are not thinking of snacking. Again, perhaps include a non-caloric drink.<br>  <br>  5. Go to the refrigerator, but not for food. Take a pen and paper to write your two affirmations you are going to post with two magnet-held. Take a non-caloric drink, then go lie down on your bed. Contemplate at length and write the two affirmations on what are more important in your life than food: something you want more than food (such as:<br>  <br>  ?

S8mPJgVOaa	Any change in your diet along with regular exercise will make a difference. The most important part, and the hardest thing will be to stick to it and don't get discouraged if you don't see results rite away!<br>  <br>  Also, the cereal in the morning may make you feel a little hypoglycemic before lunch and give you some pretty harsh cravings. You may want to try one egg, one piece of ham and one piece of toast with about two tablespoons of your favorite jelly, have skim milk or water to drink with it. <br>  <br>  Also fruits are important to incorporate into a healthy diet, don't go nutty though because they are high in sugar.<br>  <br>  Another thing I was thinking is if you're consuming two sandwiches a day you may get sick of them quickly and find it hard to stick to the diet for an extended period of time, so you may want to have a salad (with the meat you were going to put in the sandwich,) in the salad, and a little bit of a healthy salad dressing, the bread, (from the sandwich you are skipping,) can be eaten along with your salad, but don't eat too much bread either because it is a carbohydrate that will turn into sugar if you don't work out!  <br>  <br>  One last thing... no soda! And if you get a sweet tooth, (like I do) get addicted to something not terrible for you and only indulge once in a while, (like, not every day!)<br>  <br>  Good luck and stick to it! It will be worth!|`|dFHsAXDMaa	As a nurse I will tell you .....the key if you are looking to loose weight is <br>  <br>  breakfast to jump start metabolism <br>  morning snack 2 hours later<br>  lunch two to three hours later <br>  afternoon snack<br>  dinner.<br>  you should not eat after two hours before going bed..for example if you go to bed at 10 do not eat after 8. this allows you body to digest food You ate and it will use store fat during the night to maintain itself<br>  <br>  avoid soda.. sugary drinks... limit fruit juices high in sugar..<br>  <br>  eat things like:<br>  oatmeal (will fill you more than cold cereals plus more nutritious )<br>  yogurt<br>  fruits<br>  veggies( with lite or low fat ranch)<br>  multigrain breads with low fat cold cuts (turkey based cold cuts are best) low fat cheese<br>  <br>  lite mayo or mustard<br>  fill sandwich with lettuce, bean sprouts and other veggies.<br>  portion of meat  like chicken ,steak etc for a meal should be size of your fist read portion sizes on thinsg like rice and stick to one serving size<br>  <br>  just so you know instead of making salads and sandwiches with iceberg lettuce try spinach or baby spinach only has 21 calories in 3 cups and that is a lot of spinach makes big salad you can top with chicken or shrimp..<br>  <br>  exercise... walking.. jogging..crunches.. etc all this help to boost your metabolism ......the biggest mistake people make when trying to loose weight is not eating often enough which works against you by slowing your metabolism way down..hope this helped you and good luck and god bless and stay safe ..I appreciate all men and woman in the armed forces do to protect my families freedom and Americas|`|i05dLLeRaa	That is on the right track. You can change things up a little if you get tired of eating the same things over and over but keep the amount of meals the same. You need many small meals a day to increase your metabolism. <br>  <br>  Make sure you cut out all sodas, as much sugar as possible. Get rid of white bread, pasta, etc.... Basically if it is made with white flour, you don't want it. Stick with 100 percent whole wheat. NOT enriched wheat. <br>  <br>  Exercise first thing in the morning before you eat. You will burn the most fat this way. Also, do not exercise too hard. Make sure you keep your heart rate in the fat burning zone. Your body needs oxygen to burn fat and if you get your heart rate up too high, it will not burn off the fat as well.

I have food intolerance to garlic and onions which are in most spicy foods. I suggest narrowing it down. Is it only when you eat spicy stuff? It could be acid reflux too.

Are you taking anything like Nexium to help protect your stomach and intestines from the Celebrex?  If not, you may want to talk to the Dr about it.  Also, don't stay on it any longer than absolutely necessary.  Good luck.

Try researching for that instead of medicine that, in my opinion, is just a sedative (something to make you numb) and doesn't really help you deal with the problem, just makes you not care (like any other drug). It's better to talk it out and have social support.  Hope you feel better.

GJ3tNgWNaa	You are not the only person who like to eat raw meat.  Remember that lots of people like eating sushi - that is raw fish - however lemon does 'cook" it.  However your diet can be bad if it is done often.  First, cooking meat usually kills bacteria that can be found on meat.  Second, raw meat is hard to digest and you should think about you stomach.  Third, most people do not find eating raw meat to be great and you will find yourself eating alone.  You might actually have some sort of deficiency.  Are you getting enough iron?|`|KEAfTavqaa	My guy cousin LOVES raw meat. I think its kind of weird. But oh well... It is ruining your insides though. You can get all sorts of worms from raw meat. Get checked for worms.|`|ICtwYntuaa	It's possible that the craving is simply your body trying to adjust for an iron deficiency.  You could try some iron supplements and see if the craving remains.|`|eYxPkgTVaa	That's gross! Maybe you're iron deficient and crave the iron in the blood, or something else you're lacking.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	go to a steak house. get a steak cooked RARE. all the bloodiness will curb your crave.|`|2Txzum3Aaa	could you be pregnant?<br>  <br>  take a test|`|NYOvfc4haa	For strange cravings like that, it's commonly due to some kind of vitamin/nutrient deficiency. I would go see your doctor about that and get some blood tests done. Guaranteed it's not the first time he or she will have heard of what you're going through, so don't be afraid to ask!<br>  <br>  I had odd cravings (too embarrassing even now for me to share what they were) for years until I got a blood test and was told I was iron deficient. The cravings stopped completely since I started taking iron supplements. It's never fun, so the sooner you address the situation the sooner you can move on with your life ;)|`|RRP8glupaa	well, raw meat most of the time is like really  dirty. it is better when its cooked. one of my teachers told me this. so ya. u might be sick i have no idea. u might wanna talk to some doctor of some sort. i think.|`|eNCadlpaaa	Maybe its just cravings for it. Raw meat is edible, however, what makes it different from cooked meat is that cooked meat is surely bacteria free.

d24443b8ec2e2ad458375b4a24f5d89eaa	Hm...I've heard of implantation bleeding - the egg implanting into the uterus wall. But it could have been just that - a little random spotting. Female bodies are strange things any hormone changes can cause odd things to happen. Soooooo...if you had sex a pregnancy is accurate 19 days after, and otherwise don't worry.
K1aT1i8caa	Ok, here are some ab workouts.<br>  but a dumbbell behind your neck while lying flat on the floor with your hands holding the weight at the ends of the dumbbell  and start doing situps. Select heavy weight. <br>  <br>  Hang on a chin up bar and raise you legs to waist level and down slowly. You can select a weight and wrap it between your ankles. Again, choose high weight and low reps. Also remember to keep you back straight and try not to move your body but only your legs in this exercise. And dont swing your legs otherwise you will be using momentum. <br>  <br>  And yea, continue playing soccer because that will brun fat around your whole body.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	soccer isnt going to give you a six pack hahah neither are leg lifts wtf

Cortisone cream might help with the swelling and pain too. Once the stinger is out, the mild poison (which causes the pain) will stop flowing into your skin.|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	The tobacco works. Also, some Benadryl before bed will ease the inflamation and itching, the next day you might feel nothing that way because it attacks what you are allergic to.|`|RBM3ncOJaa	One time I was stung by something and someone chewed up some tobacco and put it on the sting and it quit hurting.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|ymyaVJHzaa	The experts in weight loss and diet programs are continuously inventing better ways to give weight loss clients the best possible answer to their weight problems. The latest trend introduced is natural weight loss. <br>  <br>  Since the procedures are natural, weight loss is considered more healthy and will really make you feel satisfied. Unlike the fad diets and “almost magic” diet programs and medications available today, natural weight loss will teach you how to shed those extra pounds in a safe manner. This weight loss method tells you the opposite of all those unreliable crash diet programs tell you; that you will lose weight if you religiously follow a long term but healthy weight loss plan.<br>  <br>  I find it much easier to believe in a weight loss procedure that does not promise to make you sexy and slim overnight, though by following the plan you will see and feel differences in as little as two weeks.<br>  <br>  There's a great site below with all the resources you need, plus it has an easy to use calculator to give you an idea what you can achieve with a little discipline and perseverance.|`|NFG9zF4zaa	Ever heard of cabbage soup diet.

W9dabUw7aa	We often inherit our height...so is your Mom and her family much taller than you...or is your Dad's family not too tall?

You may not reach 5 ft., though. Besides, heredity has as much to do with it as anything. Once, when I was in 7th grade, I stressed out in front of my science teacher about the fact that I wasn't approaching six feet (I was probably around 5 ft. 6 in. at the time). She said that she had seen my father and that he wasn't all that tall. So I resigned myself to the likelihood that I wouldn't ever be 6 feet tall.|`|9QyrW2iCaa	I'm not sure if you can grow TWO whole inches . . . that's a lot to ask for.  Generally speaking, most girls reach their maximum height at age 14.<br>  <br>  Don't despair.  Sign yourself up for yoga.  Yes, yoga. Yoga is all about the mighty spine.  I'm not kidding you, but as an ADULT -- you know that I've stopped growing physically -- I gained ONE inch after over one year of yoga practice.  Go for it!  You will be amazed at the difference yoga will make in your life.<br>  <br>  Yoga teaches us to cure what need not be endured and endure what cannot be cured.  ~B.K.S. Iyengar<br>  <br>  Yoga powers. <br>  To make oneself invisible or small. <br>  To become gigantic and reach to the farthest things. <br>  To change the course of nature. <br>  To place oneself anywhere in space or time . . .<br>  in one's deepest inner mind, or in the minds of others. <br>  ~ JIM MORRISON|`|AA10907244	I think growth stops at around 19 or 20.

P7rBYyXvaa	Dude, if you can hit 100 reps with a ten pound dumbbell, go heavier. the most you should do is like 25. Doing 25 increases muscular endurance- the ability to go longer. This will also decrease soreness. Stretching your biceps can also reduce soreness. but seriously, doing ten reps with a 25, 35, or more will increase muscular strength, and build muscle.|`|3BfVbk5haa	hmm first of all they hurt because your ripping muscle , so eat protein get regular sleep . Lifting will rip them , sleep will help them heal protein repairs your muscles but bigger. Btw you lift the dumbbell100 or 200 times in a total week or one day ? if its one day move up the weight to 15 or 20 do 15- 20 repetitions it means how many times you do it with 3 sets meaning you do its 15 times take a break for 50 sec then start again that's one set then do it another 15 times take a break 50 sec second set of 15 and so on do . Do 3 sets and also do other exexercises that focus on your bicep so bench dips for your triceps go on youtube and search them and you will find them, this works out the stronger muscle of the two the tricepss stronger then the biceps Remember do other exexercise slso do cardio - for your heart like run , warm up just using dumbbells alone isn't going to help. What use is good arms if you can't run ,, or your have saggy pecs - man boobs|`|Ov8jbP1Taa	when they are sore its cause muscle is building... just wait till you stop being sore to do it again never work out when your sore... that may damage your muscles
3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	No, you do not need to tell the company you work for. Your psychiatrist, therapist, & family doctor need to know. Also, a dentist if you are having work done (can react with pain meds etc.). Finally, a few close family members should know, in case you are one of the people who get worse on antidepressants, so they can intervene & let you know you are getting worse. You may not be able to tell.  Sometimes, a person really has bipolar, and antidepressants make them worse - I think that is a common scenario for these flip outs on antidepressants.|`|db0b210c80d4e4ffe387d7e20319c906aa	No, you don't need to tell anyone.

Autism is specifically excluded from a diagnosis of PDD.<br>  <br>  That being said, you need to invoke your rights under the Family and Medical Leave Act. You can take up to 6 weeks off without losing your job if your company and you are both subject to the FMLA. If your employer has more than 50 employees, and you have been at your job for a full year, then you are eligible. <br>  <br>  You can always ask for another alternative, such as switching from full to part time, but that is not required. The only thing required is that you still have a job after taking 6 weeks off to care for your child with a medical problem.|`|wxXCqVj4aa	If they fired you because they have a problem with you having an autistic child, THAT would be discrimination. But if they can't accomodate you and you demand less hours they have every right to fire you. Certainly just asking alone would not be grounds for firing. Some states (like CA) have programs that assist you to allow you to stay home with your son, or give you the ability to hire someone to help care for him. You may also be able to get help from your local regional center. They could also inform you on all your state resources.

Most people with this condition sort of have to live with the symptoms that it produces.  The only thing that you can really due to treat the symptoms. <br>  <br>  Ice your knee after activity. Use anti-inflammatory meds, like Advil. Finally, invest in simple jumper's knee strap (it goes right under your patella)|`|8lOevqftaa	Osgood Schlatter's disease is called an "overuse" syndrome occurring commonly in physically active males. Treatment is focused on a reduction of activity. Resolution occurs over a period of months, but in 5-10% of patients the condition becomes chronic.<br>  <br>  It would be for the best that you totally recover first before doing any strenuous activity that would aggravate the condition. Putting ice packs would only anesthesize the area for a short time but the damage progresses as you continue to put stress on that area

f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|c26ifpPDaa	use lotion, it doesn't matter which kind its the conditioning part of the lotion that helps.  i have pretty bad stretch marks too from ds and i have been using lotion the last month 2x daily and it has helped so much.|`|8nRuyFjGaa	there are stretch mark healing lotions on the lotion section in most stores like walmart, make sure they are cocoa butter mixed.. <br>  good luck|`|qyy3K51Jaa	I used to have a few, but, they disappeared on their own...

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|bKlGcORPaa	Most diets these days will actually cause you to gain more weight in specific areas in the long run.<br>  <br>  I suggest you use a natural system to help you lose the weight you want.

Now we know that brain repair does happen, although not enough," he said. "Now with a therapy of putting in new cells, there is great hope that people will be able to recover from stroke in a meaningful way."<br>  <br>  This study, published in today's issue of the journal Public Library of Science-ONE, marks the first time researchers have used human embryonic stem cells to generate neural cells that grow well in the lab and improve animals' physical abilities. <br>  <br>  The transplanted cells did not form tumors, as feared. Nor did they cause seizures, another dangerous side effect. <br>  <br>  Scientists explained that the transplanted cells may not act as replacements, but instead help nurse the injured brain back to health. The new cells <br>  <br>  secrete chemicals that help the brain recover -- perhaps by stimulating new blood vessel formation or by promoting the growth of new neural pathways. <br>  <br>  "What we think they are doing is working like little factories, producing factors that improve the environment for recovery," said Steinberg, whose work is funded by the National Institutes of Health. <br>  <br>  Stanford researchers will work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to start manufacturing these cells in greater quantities, to "scale up" production for testing in other animals -- and someday, perhaps humans. <br>  <br>  Because it is possible to grow these cells in bulk, it raises the prospect of an ongoing source of therapy, said scientists. <br>  <br>  "The great thing about these cells is that they are available in unlimited supply and are very versatile," said senior scientist Marcel Daadi. <br>  <br>  Still, the team warned that it could be five years before the same approach is considered for human testing. And even if successful, it is likely to offer the greatest benefit to new patients, not those with longstanding permanent damage. <br>  <br>  What is a stroke? <br>  <br>  Stroke is caused by a disruption in the flow of blood to part of the brain because of either a blocked or ruptured blood vessel. The death of brain cells causes paralysis, speech and sensory problems, memory and reasoning deficits, coma and, often, death. <br>  <br>  There are no effective treatments for improving the residual disabilities resulting from stroke. Drugs called thrombolytics can reduce damage -- but less than 5 percent of patients get them in time to help. <br>  <br>  The new cells are the laboratory-grown progeny of human stem cells harvested from the brains of donated aborted fetuses. <br>  <br>  The Stanford team grew the embryonic stem cells in a broth of growth hormones that nudged the cells to mature into stable neural stem cells. <br>  <br>  Over time, with further coaxing, these neural stem cells matured into three families of brain cells -- neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. <br>  <br>  How study worked <br>  <br>  The cells were injected into the brains of 10 laboratory rats with an induced form of stroke that left one forelimb weak. This injury parallels the type of damage experienced by human stroke victims. They were put in a part of the brain that was adjacent to the most damaged part, but which still had some surviving tissue. <br>  <br>  The new cells migrated to the damaged regions of the brain, perhaps sensing trouble. Then they incorporated into the surrounding tissue and began to help repair damage. To prevent possible rejection, rats were treated with an immunosuppressant drug. The new cells stayed alive and functional. <br>  <br>  After two months, the rats were scored on leg use, compared with untreated animals. Rats that received the stem cells were able to use their forelimbs more normally than untreated injured rats. Researchers who scored the tests did not know which mice had received injections. <br>  <br>  Scientists are now examining the brains of the rats to better understand the process of recovery. <br>  <br>  The Stanford scientists used a cell line approved by President Bush. Non-embryonic cells have been shown to improve some function of damaged brains, but these cells are not diverse enough and are not amenable for large-scale production. <br>  <br>  Previous studies have shown that stem cells can halt spinal motor neuron degeneration and restore function in animals with spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, this study is the first to show t|`|AA10264290	Yes they can, stem cells will allow him to build up more neurons and his brain function will be back to normal. The trouble with this is that the government will not allow it is of right now, maybe in the future they will see the light that can come from them!

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	i. Eat more calories<br>  <br>  This involves some calculation. The approximate normal daily caloric requirement for an average male who performs light activity is 2,200; for a female, it is 1,900.You need to eat around 1,000 extra calories per day to gain less than half a kilo a week.<br>  <br>  Do the math. Eat larger portions and eat at least five meals a day.<br>  <br>  Your actual caloric requirement can differ depending on your height, weight, activity level and your body's metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  ii. Make smart choices<br>  <br>  For example, choose dairy products, Eat foods with high protein content such as beans, pulses and peas, and foods with high starch content such as potatoes, rice and tapioca.<br>  <br>  *<br>  One hour spinning = perfect body<br>  <br>  iii. Protein is important<br>  <br>  Increase your protein intake. Your body needs a lot of protein to build new muscle. But since most of the calories for weight gain comes from carbohydrates and fats, do not replace them with protein.<br>  <br>  iv. Snack a lot<br>  <br>  Consume a lot of high-calorie snacks (not junk food) such as cheese sticks, milk shakes, muffins, dried fruits, yoghurt and breakfast bars.<br>  <br>  *<br>  healthy Ayurvedic mantras<br>  <br>  v. Fluids help too<br>  <br>  Drink a lot of fluids that supply nutrients and calories; milk, fresh fruit juices and energy drinks are good examples.<br>  <br>  vi. Intensify workouts<br>  <br>  Aerobics are great, right? Not for weight gain!<br>  <br>  You need to exercise really hard and intensely to gain muscle mass.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Is walking better than running?<br>  <br>  vii. Weights are the way to go<br>  <br>  Focus on free weight exercises (which do not require machinery) that target your large muscle groups. For example, you need dumbells, not fancy gym machines.<br>  <br>  Free weights put the most stress on muscles and stimulate the maximum number of muscle fibres.<br>  <br>  The best weight training exercises for building muscle mass are free weight exercises like squats, dead lifts, bench presses, barbell rows, pull ups and bar dips.<br>  <br>  These exercises are best done under supervision, but they don't need machinery.<br>  <br>  viii. Space out your workouts<br>  <br>  If you have a high basic metabolic rate -- which means you expend a lot of energy even at rest -- you need short intense workouts instead of long periods of low-stress activity.<br>  <br>  *<br>  Are carbs bad for you?<br>  <br>  ix. Creatine?<br>  <br>  Creatine supplements can help some athletes gain weight. It is not known if it is because it gives them spurts of energy or because it adds water weight.<br>  <br>  More research is needed in this area before Creatine becomes that magic pill. Creatine supplements are available at all major health food stores, but do not take it without consulting your doctor.<br>  <br>  x. Be consistent<br>  <br>  It might take a long time, usually a few months, for the weight to actually show. Some people get frustrated and quit when they fail to see drastic results.<br>  <br>  Your body will only responds to a consistent schedule. No weight gain programme will work for you if you are not regular.<br>  <br>  Heredity does pay a major role in determining your weight.

Big factors are your skeletal structure and how much muscle you have. So a person really athletic will weigh more then the charts say. Muscle is many times more dense then fatty tissues. <br>  <br>  Especially since at 12 if you are 5' 1 1/2" you will likely end up 5'6" or taller.

vTYGC8qTaa	Listen, you are gorgeous. SAY IT!!! "I AM GORGEOUS".... lol.. But I know school can be tough sometimes. Get involved with school activities and clubs and camps etc. This will boost your self esteem and also have you meet people that have similar interests. FOR GOSH SAKES wear your hair however it makes you happy!!! Other people don't get a say in what you do or how you feel so don't worry!

If it's that hard for you to wear your hair down, how about taking small steps and start with wearing it half down for awhile?  And then when that is comfortable go ahead and wear it all down?

RB0ICpJCaa	Yes it's true. The girl with the stronger hormone level will stay the same, and everyone will adjust to her. The reason for this dates back many years ago. It's kinda of a survival thing. Back when cave men were still around, the women would have their period around the same time as the "alpha female". Think of it this way. If you were on your period and everyone else around you was not. Then the males would not "mate" with you. But if your body adjusts, then all the women will bleed around the same time(no threat), and not bleed around the same time. Able to get pregnant and pass on their genes(survival).|`|EXq2QYqOaa	How is that gross? It's natural.... But anyway, that's true. Though, I am more in sync with some of my close friends than I am with my mom. We live together and she normally gets her period before I do.

It has a lot to do with what we call the reporter bias - people tend to notice when it does happen, but they don't notice when it doesn't happen, so people get the idea that it happens a lot more often than it does.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean that it doesn't ever happen - just that it doesn't happen enough to cause a statistical correlation.|`|Z4PxfObXaa	I've always heard that girls can 'throw off' other girls' periods, making them come at different times, simply by being around them.<br>  I didn't believe this at all until I read the way you phrased it.<br>  Because now that I think about it, my mom, my sister and I all get our periods around the same time.<br>  Hm...<br>  That's really weird.<br>  I don't understand how that could happen.<br>  But whatever.|`|AA10232076	It's true, if you're really close to someone, then sometimes your TOMs will happen at around the same time. Pretty cool, yet weird at the same time.|`|PImvmP1paa	Possibly. <br>  <br>  I've had friends where their periods would end and their mom's would get them or vice versa.<br>  <br>  It's the pheromones being passed from one another.|`|QuMXIodMaa	That has ALWAYS been my experience!  Even when I was taking birth control pills my periods would adjust themselves around the other females I spent most of my time with. My daughter who is 9 gets hormonal around the same time as me and she has not yet started her period.  That's a good reason that you and your friends probably get snippy with each other!  Your all in bad moods at the same time!  Good thing is someone always should have a pad or tampon when you need it!|`|i0y3CYoHaa	Yup, it's true. It's because you're so close to each others that you sort of breathe in each other's hormones (more like pheromones).<br>  <br>  It's actually not that gross, it just means that everybody's miserable at the same time.|`|0XyNuD1waa	ya it's true... me and both of my other sisters always have it around the same time... and they usually follow me cuz i'm the one on the bcp. for regularity... <br>  idk y tho... i heard that it has something to do with the smells and fumes of it... <br>  <br>  gross...|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	I've never heard it being called TOMs haha that's cool I guess.<br>  But yes it's actually true...I've experienced...I remember back in high school my best friend and I would get our periods almost always on the same day.|`|510MC9SVaa	Like that SO totally can happen.

Use one of the alternatives shown, such as snapping a rubber band against your wrist, or holding an ice cube. There is much information, and useful weblinks in the website: far too much to fit in the allowable space here. Seek therapy, to help you address the actual cause of those problems, rather than using an inappropriate method of treating the symptoms, which others have found, doesn't work, in the longer term, and that leaves behind the extra problem of scarring to deal with, then. There is also a selection of treatments for scarring shown. So, are you aware of why you self harm? <br>  <br>  The reasons generally given are: depression (see section 2, at ezy build; page R first, then, if female; page V, young women's depression, & teen? depression; eventually the rest); if male; male depression; anger (see section 4; page C first), attention seeking, or boredom (suggestions for both are in section 16). Stress is addressed in section 42, at ezy build; view the COMPREHENSIVE POST on page i, first, then the rest of that section. Consider taking up amateur abstract, impressionist, or surrealist art, clay modelling, designing and/or making fashion, or jewellery. Journalling those thoughts, and feelings, poetry, or story writing are some more options. No-one has to see them, but you may well surprise yourself at how good you become, with experience. Even if not, and you are totally dissatisfied with every single effort, it will still have served its purpose. Use that emotional energy, and allow it expression, through an activity other than self harm. Teen resources; check out section 13; on pages A, K & T.

6JEhoZ08aa	Hi.<br>  I also found myself with a remarkably itchy nipple this February. So I did what anyone would do...I scratched it. It only made the itch worse. There were no other signs of anything. So I went to the doctor when the itching got worse and even started to burn. Turns out that I have a fungus infection under my nipple. Weird. I know. But there you go. So now I put Clomatrizole on it twice a day (12 hours apart) and it is going very well. <br>  So you could always see you doctor about it. I hope this helps.
i0y3CYoHaa	I actually was on Tri-Cyclen for a while and didn't really like it. As far as I know, the original ones (same pill for 21 days, 7 days without) were mimicking the hormones present during pregnancy. During pregnancy, hormone levels change so that no more eggs are let out, because it wouldn't be healthy to have two babies of different ages in there. I'm pretty sure that the regular (one level) pills have the same effect : they give you a regular balance of hormones.<br>  <br>  My personal preference is the one-level cycle (can you tel?l :P) because it actually helps regulate other things in my body (acne, mood swings, etc). The three cycles had no fun side effects other than, you know, contraception.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	Physicians can be incredibly arrogant sometimes....I have had physicians that have talked to me like I'm a child and frequently interrupted me. <br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable with your dr, then go to a new one. <br>  <br>  Good luck! I tried the tri-cyclen. I used it to treat Endometriosis...It didn't work for me because of the changes levels...I needed a monophasic so I switched back. <br>  <br>  I think the monophasics are better if you have Endometriosis or if you suffer from severe cramps with your periods.|`|mGTjFgCwaa	By my best understanding, the only difference is, instead of 12 periods/year, you get 3. It doesn't cause any damage to your body, because, as you mentioned, the hormones mimic your body's natural hormone cycle.<br>  <br>  Perhaps she wrote the prescription wrong, it seems like an honest mistake. Other doctors prefer one drug over another, it could be her personal preference.<br>  <br>  Since I don't know your medical history, I couldn't pin point an exact reason.
0WnZD5acaa	Hey hun, do you have any other of these symptoms? If so, it may be Acute Appendicitis....<br>  <br>  Appendicitis<br>  <br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  The main symptom of appendicitis is belly (abdominal) pain. The pain can feel like indigestion or like you need to have a bowel movement or pass gas. Many people feel the first pain near the belly button. Then it moves to the lower right side of the belly. But the pain can be in different parts of your belly or even on your side. The pain may get worse if you move, walk, or cough. You may also have a fever or feel sick to your stomach.<br>  <br>  Many people who have had appendicitis say the pain is hard to describe. It may not feel like any pain you have had before. It may not even be a very bad pain, but you may feel like something is wrong. If you have moderate belly pain that does not go away after 4 hours, call your doctor. If you have severe belly pain, call your doctor right away.<br>  <br>  You may have appendicitis if:<br>  <br>      * You have pain in your belly. The pain may begin around your belly button.<br>      * The pain in your belly gets stronger and moves below your belly button on your right side (the lower right quadrant). This is the most common place to feel pain when you have appendicitis.<br>      * The pain does not go away and gets worse when you move, walk, or cough.<br>      * You have pain in any part of your belly or on your side.<br>      * You feel nauseated or throw up a few times. You also may not feel like eating.<br>      * You have constipation, back pain, a slight fever, or a swollen abdomen.<br>  <br>  Some people do not have the symptoms listed above. Older people, children younger than 2 years, and pregnant women may not have pain in the lower right part of the belly. Other people feel pain in their side because their appendix is in a different position than normal.<br>  <br>  Pain in the abdomen is very common.<br>  <br>  There are also many conditions with symptoms similar to appendicitis. But because appendicitis can become serious in a short amount of time, call your doctor right away if you have any of the symptoms listed above. Treatment is much easier if the appendix has not ruptured. In most people, the appendix does not rupture until they have felt sick for at least 24 hours.|`|AMvR4u2Taa	Could be your appendix. Are you having any other symptoms?
PImvmP1paa	My eyebrow from when I got smacked in the face with a kick ball, in 6th grade, and my glasses bent and the nose piece holder thing cut my eyebrow. I ended up with a bloody nose too. lol.

If I ever decide to take my ring out, the hole will still be there. <br>  <br>  My left knee. I was running down a grassy hill, at recess when I was in like 4th or 5th grade, and hit the pavement.

My left knee had a huge gash in it and a lot of dirt. <br>  <br>  The bottom of my left foot. Stepped on a sparkler, on the 4th of July, when I was like 8.

d92m1ARbaa	Get some help ASAP. It's crucial now, not to waste any time. <br>  First, there is still some possibility you could talk to someone close to you. He/she knows somebody who can help you (psychologist/psychiatrist). Since this is a severe form of depression both drugs and social activity may be helpful. Sometimes people with depression are encouraged in doing some sort of sport (costless) or interacting with people. However medications play an important role for the fist few months.<br>  Good luck!|`|XzV4bUeFaa	You need to get help for yourself so that you can be the best mother possible to your child(ren).  I know it's hard when you don't have insurance, but from what you describe, you need medication to help you get to where you want and should be.  Check w/mental health clinics in your area.  They may have fees based on a sliding scale.  There is nothing anyone here can do for you to change what is wrong w/you.  Panic/anxiety disorder, social phobias can and do respond to meds and talk therapy.  It is not easy!  It takes time and trial and error w/meds which you must take exactly as prescribed even when feeling better or whatever success you have will spiral downward again.  So please, I'm sure you can find someplace where you can be helped.|`|XIykYrCnaa	Go to psychology|`|RwTBTYmFaa	okay first off, i'm not sure what your income level is, but if you apply for medicaid in your state you should get it. also there are state mental health place's that see people on a sliding fee scale. dept. of social service's should be able to help both with medicaid and the number's to state provided mental health care.also your local united way should offer counseling on a sliding fee scale. your dept of social service's or the america red cross can help with transportation if you have none.. that should get you onto the right path to doctor's to help you deal with and figure out what help you need. best of luck to you jamie

283JrACKaa	JUST QUIT UR DUMBASS SCHOOL|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	I personally would be proud as hell to be asian. I was just reading the new book "Intelligence and How to Get it" It dicusses why Asians are such high achievers....They have a strong work ethic and believe that intelligence is malleable....They don't give up. Also, when faced with failure, they get even more motivated to acheive...whereas European americans get discouraged by failure. You should be proud of your race. <br>  <br>  Don't kill yourself!!!! I once thought about suicide.....I was so low and so depressed....But then things changed and I am sooo happy. I too had peopl emake fun of me and say evil things to me. I will tell you what I have learned in a nutshell....OTHER PEOPLE DON'T MATTER!!! Well to put it better, other peoples opinions don't matter. I used to get so bent up about what others thought...I had a wicked boyfriend that spread rumors that I was a slut and whore.....and I cared so much about the rumors.....But then later on I realized....who the hell cares?? I know Im not a slut and thats all that matters....You can't control what goes in in morons brains...you need to enjoy life for yourself. Live for yourself. <br>  <br>  How are you doing in school? If you arent doing well....it is because of your depression. When I was depressed, I did really s h i t t y in school.

Elementary school and high school is hard. I was not in the popular crowd by any means. I found a couple of good friends who I could rely on and who I could trust in.

Just because a group of crummy immature kids don't like you, there are a ton more of people who don't like those kids. If the people who you hang out with are bringing you down, leave them to bring themselves down and find a fun and happier group of people..I know what you mean by the counselor. Going to one makes you feel more 'crazy' than if you weren't to go. I don't to beat a horse but wouldn't it be nice if you did care about your future and your grades and went to college and got a job that you could brag about and a job that you could enjoy. The teenage years are the hardest. When you get to college it completely changes to your benefit. There are many types of people. You just have to mold what type of person you are.

Where would we be without the many different nationalities we have on this planet, we all need each other, and each race has its own uniqueness and beauty to it, asains are very beautiful, but especially remember there is only one you in this world so love yourself more than anything, but remember the real beauty is on the inside but we each have unique inner and outer qualities whether we are outwardly unattractive or attractive. Hang in there, be a warrior to be a good and kind person, even if we open up to others sometimes they will hurt us, but also remember that sometimes people can also be kind to us. You deserve to see your future, remember there may be hard times, sad times, maybe even really hard times, when hard times come just hang on with everything you've got and you'll come out stronger, but there will also be the most beautiful times and miraculous times that life will give.

Oh, puh-leeze. Behave like a virus and that's what they'll do to you every time, because you behave like a virus.<br>  4. So you refuse what help there is because of what? Proud? Stupid? Scared someone will find out? Perform two actions: a. plug mouth; b. open ears. Stop whining if you want a solution, and listen for a change. You're so busy being defensive that the answer could jump out of the bushes and you'd push her away.<br>  5. Wanna die?

If you are not doing good in one of them, there's tons of other situations where you can excel and be happy. Don't bother about what other people say, as long as, when you go home, you feel protected, you are better.<br>  In life, we should learn how to separate these different worlds and try to be happy in most of them.<br>  So, don't destroy you life: aren't a little be jealous that others can go on in their life and be happy, while you are frozen in time?|`|jJZNf1gTaa	I've been to that point where I wanted to give up.

As far as race issues go, I've faced some myself and I know how much it sucks when people are close minded.  But you know what honey?  That's on them, not on you.  They are the ones who are ignorant, and a complete waste of your time. Be proud of your background, at all times.  You need to be here so that you can talk to others that want to learn about where you came from and why it's special.  We need you here please. <br>  <br>  Think about your family, and how much they love you.  They would be very hurt and sad if you're gone.  And are the bullies worth you dying? No honey, they're not.  But your family matters a lot more, and they are worth living for.  <br>  <br>  I hope you always remember that you are worth living for.  <br>  <br>  I can't really help you much over the internet, but I do hope that you reach out to your loved ones for help.

If so, you should be OK, as long as you shut down, or hibernate. <br>  <br>  It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind.<br>  <br>   Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method.|`|ZzXK3nAAaa	"Even paranoids have enemies."--Henry Kissinger<br>  <br>  Actually they sneaked in and stole your germ plasm.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|MpTZjdLJaa	dieting sites are stupid<br>  never work<br>  losing wieght is very simple<br>  the only factor that will stop you is temptation<br>  if you stay commited, then pounds will fly off you<br>  If you have lost 5 pounds already, keep doing what you are doing<br>  just some extra tips:<br>  1. list of bad foods:<br>  chips, popcorn(only if butter is included), cheese, anything fried, an fastfood<br>  2. veggies, the greener the better.

Part of the problem with depression is not being able to do the things you need to do to help like being scared to go out and do things that help. People without depression can't seem to understand this.. <br>  Anyways I have researched alot of things and i have found that a persons diet is a big factor in how well you feel..  <br>  <br>  My diet isn't always as good as it should be so I tried EMPowerplus natural supplements  made to help depression which the creator stumbled upon (you can find the story on you tube).. It has high dose B12 vitamins among other vitamins which is known to give you energy and most people do not have enough of this vitamin , if you search for reviews on Google and go on you tube you will find many testimonials about people  completely dropping there prescription meds and using just this product and feeling really good.  <br>  <br>     Theres also a health canada video about when they tried   to ban its sale which is totally absurd when you read about it  the EMPowerplus won the case though . its crazy all those prescription meds that can cause liver probs and withdrawal  symptoms nightmares etc.. and health Canada tries to ban a natural cure for depression! Most likely because they didn't stand to make any money from non prescription natural products  and was hurting sales of prescription meds there reason for banning it was a total joke and only hurt the people who relied on the product.<br>  <br>  I bought some its pretty expensive so i only take half the dose I should per day but I honestly feel a difference in my mood and it seems like the cloud of depression has lifted. I researched it for about 2 weeks before I decided to try it  i truly believe that it helps and it is natural.  Read up on it in my experience it was well worth the money because I feel better than i have in years. and there's no bad side effects what so ever .<br>  <br>  PS I am not a salesman for this product and I think it is way over priced but I truly believe it has helped my depression. Don't expect to feel better within a few days of taking it either i started feeling better within a few weeks though. research it and if you think its worth trying im sure you wont be disappointed.|`|N89HLv92aa	Lexapro is very good.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	It depends on the person taking the meds.

ZkwtldYlaa	Yoghurt, cheese, and boiled chicken. Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop.

I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product.

S2xWbrgpaa	You should definitely ask her soon, and start the conversation. Just sit her down and tell her everything, Tell her that you are confused and you need to get your questions answered from someone who knows. BTW the discharge is normal, I had it for 2 years before my period|`|AA10363258	just talk to her. she will be proud of you for coming to her and it will make your relationship stronger and will show that you are mature for being brave enough to ask her.|`|XqHk0jU9aa	you should not wait for her...<br>  just go and ask her clearly...<br>  after all she is your mom...<br>  don't worry... everything will be all right...<br>  god bless you...|`|crZg76Hpaa	Just ask her.

Z6NWK5Koaa	My 4 yr old wasn't vaccinated. He started the classic signs at the age (14-16 months) that most kids who have shown signs  that have been vaccinated that I know. My question is "Are the other kids being  injured by the Vaccines or are they on their natural track?"<br>  <br>  OBVIOUSLY at this point my son seems to be on his natural track. We haven't done genetic testing or biomedical tests yet to see if those could be effecting him. But I think either he was born that way and maybe other environmental factors are clogging his system.|`|hEpL5MsWaa	There has been a lot of debate over this and recently science just confirmed that they are not linked. Here is a little excerpt from the article:<br>  <br>  "Court sides with science, says no vaccine-autism link<br>  <br>  The special court overseeing the US National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program has ruled against three families who claim that thiomersal and the MMR vaccine are responsible for their children's autism."|`|bjqjkDMHaa	I know a lot about autism, however, my reading and experience are pretty much research based...so far, scientists have found little if any correlation at all between vaccines and children having autism.  <br>  I say this: if you skip the vaccine and your kid DIES of the disease the shot would've protected them from, there is no way they'll even have the chance to show autism symptoms.  <br>  So which would you as a parent rather risk for being autistic or getting a horrible disease and dying suddenly at a very young age?<br>  Yeah, I'd pick the vaccine too.  <br>  For now, I'd say that's the best way to go.  My brother is autistic, I am very mildly autistic...yeah.  I'd rather be aspie than dead.|`|UUx74K5Caa	My niece is autistic but we think in her particular situation it had nothing to do with vaccines.  However, you should do a lot of reading from both sides.  I like what Jenny McCarthy has to say on the subject, even though she gets a lot of flack for it.
i0y3CYoHaa	Yup, it's called spotting. You'll probably get your period soon, but there's also a chance that that's all you get this month (a good thing, believe me). It's just your body adjusting.|`|a92aaf69c31f3c24aa6470a18ea029d9aa	It will take some time in order for your cycle and periods to become regular. This can take a year or more.|`|tQnE8PPTaa	Hm I wouldn't be too worried right now. Just because you started your period, it's probably still adjusting to you. If it continues I'd probably talk to a doctor.|`|68o68mENaa	Well, you did just start.<br>  Until having your period for about 2-4 years, you won't get a regular, easy to predict pattern.<br>  It'll probably just start up again in a day or two.<br>  <br>  Don't worry.<br>  And don't freak.<br>  :)

xVBqqXX8aa	nah for us who use larger condoms they only make them in a very few variety. thin, lubricated, war sensations that's about it|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Yes. And most of the condoms in Oz (and here in NZ) are imported. Defeats your request for Aussies only to answer.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised a sex store wouldn't have larger sizes. They'd have to otherwise all the bigger guys would have to forego protected sex. Google Magnum condoms in Aussie. Might have to buy online if it comes down to it.
i0y3CYoHaa	Are you in the States / Canada? I don't know about other places, but you probably have a sexual health center near you. What I did at your age was I got the pill there for free. If you're in high school, then you usually don't have to pay. They also only deal with you, there's no parental consent necessary.<br>  <br>  If they ask about sex, just say it's something you've considered. I was pretty shy, so they left it at that. The reason they give the pill for free is because they're concerned with teen pregnancy rates, and because they know that sometimes teens don't use contraception because the parents won't let them. Same reason they give free condoms.<br>  <br>  Have you talked to your mom yet? If you explain that your period is never regular she'll probably understand. If she hears what you've written here about your group then I don't think she'll worry. Do you have acne? That's another benefit of the pill - it lessens it a bit.|`|PfE6bg5iaa	Even if you got on the birth control now, it takes about 3 months for your body to get used to the hormones. Common side effects in the first three months or so include breast tenderness, nausea, upset stomach... doesn't sound so great for after-prom huh :-( On top of all that, it often takes a few miserable weeks to realize that the particular dosage you are on isn't right for you... only to change to a different dosage and try all over again.<br>  <br>  Birth control is a medication, not a convenience. Serious side effects include blood clots, stroke, and heart attack. Birth control gave me blood clots at 21 yrs old and almost killed me. Too many women, including myself at one point, think that birth control is just a cure-all with no consequences. I always suggest that birth control only be used for contraception. <br>  <br>  With all that said, I think you should ask your mom if you can go see a doctor about your irregular cycle. Don't bring up the birth control, go to the doctor appointment and if they think it's a good option they can recommend it to your mom. That way it's not you the one asking for the pill, it's the doctor! So it doesn't seem like you're being sneaky and trying to start having sex, you know? Just say "Mom my periods are so irregular and I'm worried about it. Could we make an appointment with the doctor to get checked out and see if there's anything they can do to help it?" Do you have bad cramps also? If so, that would help your case.<br>  <br>  Please do NOT go to Planned Parenthood or comparable clinic for this. These clinics often hand out the pill like it's candy and are intended for young girls who are having sex and have no financial means of getting birth control. Since you have a legitimate medical problem -- highly irregular periods -- you should inform your mom and see a real doctor that doesn't work for a non-profit.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and please make sure that you don't have a family history of blood clots before you take a hormonal BC pill!!|`|MD5aEsiFaa	Just be honest with her. Even if worst comes to worst, I know at least in Canada there re free confidential sexual health clinics that will provide them to you for cheap or free. Just do some research, and if your mom is really unreasonable, you still may have options. Anyways, she really shouldn′t have issues, it′s such a tame subject.|`|QdVhohZnaa	i had many weeks of period like 4 to 5 weeks of period so i HAD  to take birth control pills  they have helped but im also taking other pills for another reason.... tell her u really need it and that u dont want to mess up the most fabulous day with BLOOD!!!  o and kiss ***.|`|QuMXIodMaa	I completely understand.  I was on my period at my senior prom.  Wasn't fun!  But please be careful.  I think that even if your mom realizes that your a good kid and still a virgin there is more to consider than just that.  Birth control at any age comes with some risks.  I started taking them when I was 15 and wish that I could go back and change that.  I stopped taking them when I was 23.  I had cysts on my ovaries and irregular periods.  Birth Control DID NOT allow me to pinpoint when I would have periods.  I still was not able to "control" the days.  It could take SEVERAL months for you to find a pill that works for you.  Talk to your mom about what her concerns are other than the sex thing.  She could very well be saving you from worse problems!  As for your tampon usage...It should not be uncomfortable it you are inserting them correctly.  Try the smallest you can find...Playtex has a really small one.  Make sure that you research how to correctly insert it.  In my experience plastic applicators are much better than cardboard or even the OB brand.  You should not even feel it.  Good Luck and Have a great time at your prom!
E4UT1fi9aa	Interval training is the way to go.  You'll burn more calories than any other workout both during the workout AND for 24 to 48 hours after.  It gives you a great afterburn as well as stimulate your muscle building hormones. <br>  <br>  Definition: Interval training involves alternating high intensity exercise with recovery periods. There are different ways to do interval training. One option is measured periods of work followed by measured periods of rest. An exampe would be 1 minute of high intensity work (such as a sprint), followed by 2 minutes of low intensity exercise (e.g., walking) and alternating that several times for 15-30 minutes.|`|v0l1JEloaa	You can also boost your metabolism with vitamin C supplements and some B-12 supplements.
510MC9SVaa	I suggest checking out your diet. It may be that you are feeding the little buggers with what you eat. A diet high in simple carbs and sugar can make a yeast infection worse. If you have been on antibiotics they will also mess up your bacteria balance. It can take a year to get your body back in balance after taking antibiotics. Acidopholis can help get the yeast under control. You can get pills from the pharmacy, or you can just eat yogurt with live and active cultures. <br>  <br>  Also, your doc should check your blood sugar. If you have had a yeast infection for 4 years then it is quite possible your blood sugar is too high and that is what is feeding the yeast. <br>  <br>  If the yeast is only in your privates, then don't douche. Douching kills off the bad and the good. Beneficial bacteria live all over us and they eat the bad bacteria and the yeast. But if you wash them away they can't do their job.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I had a severe (bleeding and sore) yeast infection for over a year and when I finally went in to see my family doctor for a check up, the first thing she did was stick my finger and check my blood glucose.  My BG was almost 400 and I am a diabetic.  I had no idea that was a primary symptom of diabetes.  You really need to have someone check your blood sugar because I don't know any other reason for a chronic yeast infection.  I don't want to scare you, but if this has been going on for 4 years, you could be risking your health in many ways if diabetes is the cause.  Please go get checked right away.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|8pgPAn1gaa	4 years?? wow...i suggest getting a differnt opinion from a different dr. i would just keep seeing your dr and trying all diff kinds of med. cotton undies and keeping the area very clean.
AA12095402	~Obviously, you haven't done much reading about the long term effects of breast implants on women...especially young women.<br>  <br>  Perhaps to you her body "seems to be built for large breasts", but I'm guessing Mother Nature and the genetics she inherited gave her her small breasts.<br>  <br>  Before you help her get her breasts surgically enlarged, rethink it.  It sounds like you might be part of her insecurity about her breasts.<br>  <br>  There are all kinds of boobs in this world.

I hope she realizes how blessed she is to have such a wonderful man like you in her life.<br>  <br>  Don't suggest implants. Don't suggest ANYTHING. You need to let her know how happy you are with her body and hope that she will start loving it, too. Implants won't fix the problem if she isn't happy with her body in general. Just reassure her that she is beautiful and just right for you.|`|pN90nXhvaa	My husband paid for mine. The thing is I had expressed my desire to get the procedure so it was my idea initially.

I think it's one of those things that she could either be totally cool with OR get totally offended and pissed off at you.<br>  Hmm maybe you could try casually bringing up the subject of fake boobs..like if you're out somewhere or watching TV and see someone with obviously fake boobs, just ask her what she thinks of women that get implants.<br>  No matter what though just keep reassuring her.<br>  <br>  Good luck
dFHsAXDMaa	you need to talk to either your mother or her mother like immediately and let them handle it they will handle it without telling her you said something.... you know how dangerous this is and i am a  nurse and i will tell you while she may be mad at you for a while when she is better she will thank you and it is worth it to saving her life.... it strains your heart... it cause internal organ damage if she is not getting enough vitamins etc tell someone today or tomorrow the latest.. help her before it is too late and she is too deep into starving herself or purging.

But I guess you don't want to face it.Hey, if you clip to close , blood will drip out. Always clean and apply a antibiotic cream after clipping your nails. An infection is very hard to treat. I know from experience.So early intervention is a must.Also walking increases circulation in your feet, So get moving. 30 Min. a day. Walk!|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	This is a common problem in people who have had diabetes for years. High blood sugar damages the blood vessels causing reduced blood flow. This is normally seen in the extremities because they are far away from the heart to begin with, and it is harder to get blood to them. It's not something that can be fixed, but keeping your blood glucose in a good range will help it from getting worse. <br>  <br>  The reduced blood flow causes wounds to heal more slowly, and infection is more likely to set in.

R8ZUrKcNaa	Well the transparent stuff I know for a fact is pre-ejaculate (precum) and that will come out all the time when aroused. Its like a natural lube.
Nq4FWEIcaa	First of all you are completely normal in getting erections frequently.  The slimy "stuff " you mention is called pre-come.  This fluid comes just before an ejaculation to aid the sperm out of the body.  I think that the reason you are not lasting long is you are too wired and end up coming too soon.  What you need to do is concentrate more on foreplay to get your body used to the building up of sex.  Actually most guys your age last about as long as you do.  Many don't last even that long so you are not abnormal in that respect.  You just need to slow it down a little and let your body get used to sex.|`|yTCywpUyaa	What's happening is normal. When you get aroused the normal thing your body does is give u an erection. Getting a pre-mature ejaculation means that u get even more sexually aroused and you want to have sex. If you get an erection a lot it's probably hormones because when you have to much testosterone in your body you get much more erections than usual.|`|AA10952792	you're a horny teenage boy. its cliche, but kind of the truth. wear low sensitivity condoms. those might help. or masturbate before sex.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	It's called 'being a teen'. Just about every guy on earth has experienced that, some more than others.<br>  <br>  The sticky clear liquid is pre-c*um or Cowper's Gland fluid. It's Mother Nature's lube. Without it, your semen would be eaten up by the acid in your urethra. When it drips out, that's your body telling you it's ready to rock and roll. <br>  <br>  As for being prem. learn the stop and go technique and adhere to it as best you can. Put your gf on top; it's a completely different sensation. <br>  <br>  Also, leave entering her till the last possible minute, and go as slowly as you can.
0nLdwZP2aa	It's ok . . . but being oil-based, it's not as 'compatible' with your body as a water-based lube would be.  I think usually a water based lube is recommended.  For anal, use something thicker like KY jelly, rather than any of the fancier liquid kinds.|`|3mAgM405aa	Anal sex is quite enjoyable and will take some preprep before engaging in it.<br>  <br>  Begin by:<br>  <br>  1. Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EXq2QYqOaa	I wouldn't EVER use Vaseline. It can potentially "dissolve" the latex and cause REALLY bad chaffing. Use a water based lubricant like KY or Astroglide. It'll feel better and you run a lower risk of pain/infection/unwanted pregnancy from the condom breaking,|`|oHsxp5weaa	YES! It works.|`|sM2aNguhaa	ya it's fine if no condoms|`|510MC9SVaa	Vaseline is a petro based product and should not be used in your body. If you don't want to spend the money to get a really good lube like Pur or Eros, then use Crisco. It is thick enough to stay around for a while and will melt as it gets hot. Don't use baby oil, it is too gritty for there. Olive oil works pretty good, but you have to reapply if you go too long (more than about 5 minutes). But Crisco or Lard will last a long time and won't harm you or your man's body.<br>  <br>  No matter what you decide to use, make sure you clean up well afterwards as the digestive track has LOTS of bad bugs in it. Also, you might want to consider taking an immodium a few hours before you try it. Foreplay is really important with anal also.|`|wKt7l6Emaa	It won't do damage, but use something else like KY brand.  Vaseline is not water soluble and does not wash away.  KY is meant to be used as a personal lubricant and will wash away.  <br>  <br>  Either way, don't forget to relax.  Tensing up can cause tearing of your rectum and that can make for "not a good time".  <br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|PTw2PIPkaa	I'd buy some KY or some other glycerin based lube.|`|86xk9JwPaa	HELLO <br>  <br>  <br>                USE COCONUT OIL|`|oLj0VTX5aa	Vaseline is NOT a good lubricant for anal sex! Especially for women.  It contains pretroleum, which can actually coat the skin and trap in bacteria and cause infections.  Spend the extra $4.00 - 10.00 and buy some KY or Astroglide - it is actually made as a natural substitute for sexual lubrication, and breaks down naturally like vaginal fluids.

AA11020187	It isn’t that it takes polyps 50 years to develop it’s that as we get older we are at a higher risk for nearly all cancers. We know from experience that a 50 year old could be polyp free and still have a stage 2 or 3 colon cancer by 60. It’s a little like driving an older car you need to look under the hood more often than if you drove a brand new car. Also, I cannot tell you how many patients with colon cancer are cured on colonoscopy. No major surgery, no chemo, no radiation – nothing else. Yet when it is caught too late you’re lucky if you live 5 years.|`|RLPM48F8aa	Colon cancer is treated much more successfully if found early. It is worth the inconvenience of a bumoscopy.|`|yu2q4tUiaa	Polyps on your colon can take years to develop if  colon cancer doesn't run in your family but if it does, you may have these growths at an early age. Now, if your colon is clear of polyps at the age of 50, you may develop polyps after 5 years. That's why your doctor tells you to have a colonoscopy every 5 years. Abnormal growths can happen because when you are older, you are at a higher risk of getting cancer. You don't need another 50 years for some polyps to grow especially if you love eating meat.|`|AYH8aVLOaa	Colon Cancer is called the silent killer.  I lost my dad to colon cancer at the age of 54.  My uncle got checked and he is only 48 and he had polyps.  It can catch up on you fast.  And that is no way to lose your life so get checked cause your body has a mind of its own.|`|RBM3ncOJaa	Doctors love to stick things up people's poopers.

i0y3CYoHaa	Depends on you. Generally yes, but some girls' hymen is more loosely attached than others, and they might have lost it by playing rougher as kids (riding horse, ...) Generally, you'll also bleed a little bit, but it's not all that much.<br>  <br>  Plus a lot depends on how good your boyfriend is. If he makes you feel really good, you'll barely notice the pain.<br>  <br>  ** Edit : don't be scared if it does hurt the first time. It's happened to all of us, but it's a one-time thing.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	It usually does, but every female is different.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yes well everyone i no say it hurts like he** and some of my friends are to scared to do it again because it hurts so much|`|yTJit4U8aa	it really depends on the person. I had heard that it wasn't that bad, but it hurt really bad for me. Breaking the hymen is what is painful. also, i was a little uneducated in the art of lovemaking and wasn't properly "warmed-up", which also made it painful. It actually was so bad, my boyfriend and I had to stop.|`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	It's different for every woman...some may just feel a little discomfort others on the other hand might get more pain, even bleeding.<br>  Keep in mind that most women tear/stretch their hymen long before they have sex.<br>  Just make sure the man you decide to lose your virginity to is gentle and respectful with you...|`|0nLdwZP2aa	It can, a bit, but it's usually not so bad.  Having a good boyfriend who takes it slowly and waits until you're really horny and ready to go will help reduce the amount.<br>  <br>  It's generally less painful than a bad menstrual cramp.|`|PImvmP1paa	To some it is, to some it's not. <br>  <br>  It depends on how small or big you are and how thick your boyfriend is.|`|cFnk4ClMaa	for me,<br>  it didnt hurt at all.<br>  i had never been fingured or anything before hand,<br>  he just stuck it straight in,<br>  we used alot of lubricant because i was too tight.<br>  and it was amazing the second he entered me.|`|ZtnE9HrOaa	it will at first for the female as her hymen breaks. (a small skin covering that goes across the inside of the vagina). It will bleed a little and the pain will go away.|`|O8rSR7z6aa	for some people it hurts and maybe bleed a little. and for some it may not hurt... it depends on if your active or not cause any activity can break your hymen(skin covering your vagina hole)|`|ighZcpzRaa	For me it only hurt a little tiny bit. It went away after about a minute.  It really depends on what you have done before and your body.

AA10952792	you don't need a pill. you may just have some performance anxiety. if you can get an erection when masturbating, you don't need a pill. pills are only for men in their 60's when its physiologically difficult or impossible for them to get hard. this seems like a mental thing.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Your Answer:<br>  No such thing, Bubba! Stop watching Porn - it's addictive - after awhile you cannot perform without it. No smoking, no beer/ale, no booze, no drugs, no junk food, no fast food garbage, no sugary sweet soda's. Get on a good, healthy diet w/lots of boiled or steamed vegetables. Drink plenty of water, fruit juices & fat free milk. Snack on lots of RAW fruit & veggies. Get up one hour early every morning & take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the evening after dinner. Within 90 days you should see fantastic results.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	You don't need a pill, as it's functioning perfectly for sex for one. Just use a different technique for when you have sex.

I'd cut down to working out four or three days a week, (doing lighter cardio the other days if you don't want to cut the routine completely,) but I bet you would see better results and more muscle gain that way. I'm not an expert though so it's just an opinion...|`|hLSIRDtZaa	It's genetic man. I know you won't believe me when I tell you this. I'm not fat at all, I'm definitely not skinny anymore either. However, there was a time in my life where I was a little underweight by a mere few pounds, and I never had a six pack. It looked like one of those ethiopian children with skinny arms and skinny legs. Now that I'm 50 pounds overweight, I still have a belly and small forearms that make me look skinny even though I'm not and all my life I've worked out somehow or another. This was my size because of genetics and I've learned to accept it. I can still run fast, jump decent, hit hard, in other words I'm still in shape. So obviously, that's just the way the water moves in the ocean. Acceptance.

G1bI7KtJaa	I have one too.:( but i know some remedies that can help.and im also 12 lmao!<br>  ok here they are:<br>  Take vitamin C tablets or eat citrus fruit regularly. <br>  Get extra vitamin C when cold symptoms appear. <br>  Remember to get plenty of natural vitamins in addition to any pills taken <br>  Although not proven, eating chicken noodle soup lessens the affects of a cold. <br>  You can also gargle some salt water to reduce mucus from the throat. <br>  Another remedy is by taking a warm bath, the steam from the bath will thin out the mucous and temporarily stop coughing. <br>  Drinking fluids will help relieve a cold sooner, so be sure to stay hydrated. <br>  Honey disolved in tea will help to soothe a sore throat. <br>  Avoid nasal 'decongestants' which reduce sinus swelling but may actually trap bacteria in your head and prolong your misery. <br>  Consider flushing out your sinuses periodically with a decongestant-free saline nasal solution. <br>  Consider taking an 'expectorant' to thin mucous and loosen phlegm, which may help you to rid your body of harmful bacteria. <br>  Hot pepper relief: Add red cayenne pepper to soup or broth to help clear your head. <br>  Take the day off: sleep is the fastest way to get over a cold. <br>  Breathe in steam to get rid of a plugged nose. <br>  There is a myth that if you eat an onion, garlic, or wasabi peanuts they are spicy so they will kill the cold virus you have. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Drinking a cup of orange juice every morning is an easy way to get Vitamin C! <br>  Eating healthy and exercising can decrease your risk of getting sick. <br>  try putting something hot over your head and have tea in steamy water. <br>  Make sure to get a good amount of sleep because that will help your body to fight off the infection. <br>  a good antivirus helps fight the rhinoviruses in your body <br>  <br>  Be sure not to overdose on Vitamin C! <br>  Medicine can sometimes be needed, so be sure to see a doctor if symptoms persist or if you feel really sick. <br>  dont eat junk food when sick it will make it worse|`|oojO4WAraa	I take vitamin C and drink lots of water.

And, remember, a cold lasts a week or seven days, whichever comes first.|`|YrQNKKpVaa	There is no cure for a cold but to cure your sore throat you have to drink plenty of water so your throat does not dry out.

fAFXkikAaa	In general, its a good idea to keep unclean things - like people's fingers - out of your eyes.<br>  <br>  Herpes is spread through skin-to-skin contact, and is most contagious when someone is having an outbreak (cold sore).    If she had a cold sore, touched her cold sore, and then touched your eye, you could indeed catch ocular hepres.     And if someone has a cold sore and you kiss them, you can indeed catch oral herpes.   In fact, if someone with a cold sore gives you oral sex, you may catch genital herpes from them.<br>  <br>  Fake nails having nothing to do with this.<br>  <br>  Also, herpes can be spread when no symptoms are present - so there is some small risk that your friend could spread her herpes to you just by kissing you on the cheek.   But you are absolutely right that herpes is MOST contagious during outbreaks.<br>  <br>  You probably already know this, but oral herpes is NOT an STD.  Most people catch it in childhood from kissing relatives, and most people (50% to 80%) have oral herpes.<br>  <br>  For a lot more good, reliable information about oral herpes, I recommend the website below.<br>  <br>  Good question.|`|fk9AvB25aa	She would have to touch a cold sore then put her finger directly into or around your eyes for you to have a better chance of getting ocular herpes. If she didn't do that then the chances of you getting herpes are next to nothing, specially if there was no out break at the time<br>  If you kiss some one with an active out break of cold sores then you have a pretty good chance of getting it if you don't have it all ready. Cold sores are very common to have. It's harder to pass but still a slight possibility of passing it while there is no out break.|`|UNo489f2aa	Getting herpes in your eye from your situation sounds possible, but not likely. Though you can get herpes in your eye. Kissing someone with a cold sore is a good way to get herpes.

You may be eating more, but as long as you aren't overeating you're golden.  <br>  Good job working it out, I imagine you're feeling much more positive in general about life.

Keep at it.|`|pNgsP3sLaa	Like the first poster said, you may be gaining muscle; Muscle is heavier than fat, remember. So if you weigh 180, but you have no flab, it's safe to say you are probably just muscular.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you're sure it's fat (stretch marks, obvious flabbiness) it could be due to a number of things. Increasing your exercise routine (since you said you recently started exercising, I assume you did not exercise in the past, or if you did, it was not consistently) will increase your body's demand for protein, and this could increase your appetite, but you may not be eating the right stuff, or you could be eating too much of the right stuff. I would suggest drinking an all natural whey protein shake in the morning with some lowfat milk. You may not be eating enough calories, either. That would trick your body to go into "starvation mode" and make you store up fat. Try monitoring your caloric intake, and keep it around 1600-1800 (ideally, never more than 2000) a day. <br>  <br>  Also, are you taking birth control pills? Some birth control can make certain people have increased appetites randomly. At least, that's the theory. I gained 20 pounds when I started BCP. =/ Good luck!|`|U5ZOkDj6aa	it probably muscle, unless you've changed your eating habits|`|04A7by3Naa	Muscle weighs more than fat.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	Muscle weighs more that fat dear. watch your measurements not the scale.|`|dFWzf6aaaa	well maybe you slould listen to one of them|`|bHr7nGAvaa	Working out is a wonderful thing to do, it increases your cardiovascular system and helps build lean muscle, which in turn will boost your metabolism.  But its not until you couple it with dieting that you will see results.  Ask any bodybuilder or model what the hardest part of getting there body was... chances are its sticking to a strict diet.  Read up on muscle and fitness magazine, by far it is one of the best reads out there for planning a fat loss regime.  I lost 45 pounds in a little less than 4 months last year.

Most of them are just vitamin/mineral pills that you can buy at the pharmacy for 1/10th the price. The main effect of these products is to make someone else rich and the only benefit to you is psychological - you believe it will work and feel good about that ands then believe it is actually working when it's not.|`|tIldpr7vaa	u could try ZMA<br>  <br>  Thers also something called Blue Up ( or Blur Rhino)<br>  <br>  But Ive heard the one made by Animal is pretty good, dont know the name|`|yNNnkze5aa	how the hell do you know if youre testosterone is boosted anyway?

RaUAM1tpaa	Sport, expecially if you want no leaks.<br>  I play basketball all year round - and I use the sport kind.|`|AA11315360	Use any plastic applicator tampons if you arent used to using them. Tampax PEARL plastic ones are good. Leak less. Always choose a plastic applicator (regular is best) and use UNSCENTED! It is inside of you so you dont need scented and it could cause vaginal problems if you have added chemicals in the tampon like scents.<br>  <br>  When you are in water your period will not come out anyway because the water is putting pressure on your body (pushing up inside of you preventing flow of blood out). So dont worry there.<br>  <br>  Tampax makes a junior size tampon as well. <br>  OB tampons are very small so you could try those. Buy the ones that have applicators.<br>  Playtex are the same size as tampax regular ones.|`|PN7XMglOaa	sport works for me|`|6b78493be9095e81afe291ca302d3ef1aa	I agree with the rest Tampax PEARL plastic are the best to go. They slide right in with no problem and last a while. It might feel uncomfortable at first but you will get use to them.. <br>  <br>  I have tried just about every brand of tampons including O.B. ( the lil tiny ones) and I find Tampax PEARL plastic the best out of them....|`|ATYp6h7Oaa	playtex sport :) really good ;and comfortablle|`|3zxVzPBxaa	tampax pearl and platex gentle glide are basically the exact same thing.|`|wnPqeJoWaa	it will hurt the first time|`|Q9LSHMcZaa	I've heard tampax sports are good!

In fact, non-organic cotton is one of the most pesticide laden crops there is in the world so unless you use organic cotton tampons, you still risk TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome) if you leave a tampon in too long.  Using them anyway exposes you to the pesticides in the cotton.<br>  <br>  In any case, I have used organic cotton tampons but the best thing since sliced bread for periods is a menstrual cup!  You need nothing else and it's so easy and versatile and very cost efficient.<br>  <br>  Check out either the Diva Cup or The Keeper.  The Keeper is no longer sold in Canada (that's what I used for 2+ years, the same one even!) because it's made in the USA and the company didn't get a renewed license with Health Canada or something but now I've ordered the Diva Cup which is similar.<br>  <br>  Basically the cup holds about 6 oz of menstrual fluid.  It's easy to insert and extract to empty.  On your heaviest days you may want to check it a few times throughout the day to see how often you may need to empty it.  It too can overflow and leak but once you're used to it in conjunction with your flow, you will never use pads or tampons again!<br>  <br>  Different companies will sell these.  I got mine from <a href="http://www.grassrootsstore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.grassrootsstore.com/</a> but they each have their own sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.divacup.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.divacup.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.keeper.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.keeper.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can probably get them cheaper but I paid around $50 for The Keeper.  That's about 4 or 5 boxes of tampons; so how long would that last you?  The "cup" will last several months.  They recommend changing it every year but mine literally lasted longer than 2 years.  Not only do you not have to carry around tampons but you're not filling landfills with menstrual products!  You don't have to worry about properly disposing of anything.<br>  <br>  Cleaning is easy.  Anti-bacterial soap and warm/hot water.<br>  <br>  They generally come in 2 sizes:  regular and "have had a baby" (since you stretch so the size would have to be a bit bigger).<br>  <br>  PS:  I am a black belt in karate and have found this product absolutely fabulous!  In karate, I wear a WHITE uniform for several hours and there's been NO accidents. :)
Wm3GDO9jaa	I had to get plan b last night. A lot of things can factor into something like this. Was she on her period?

Now what if hte lady instead snatched the plate away from her and said OMG look at you your going to kill yourself you fat pig stop eating!!!!<br>  <br>  Its just not socially acceptable to be mean to overweight people.

p3NW0Mstaa	I have never heard of that being a situation with lighter eyes, but I am no eye doctor.  I have very dark brown (chocolate) color eyes and get "floaters" they are normal for all eye colors from what I know.|`|ZA18KoC9aa	apparently floaters are a part of the aging process..other causes of floaters include shortsightedness and knocks to the head and sports such as boxing, football etc|`|CoDUHl7Uaa	more floaters?? you'll have to be a bit more persis than that!!|`|fF1WbPltaa	As one gets older the fluid inside the eye get thicker and pulls at the retina.

oi6eHkPzaa	I don't really have any practical advice for you, i'm afraid, but i can tell you this. I am a 32 y.o. male and i'm terrified of spiders. Honestly, no b.s. I'm also a fairly big dude, so people think it's just a big joke and it isn't. A phobia is a terrible thing, it can ruin your life. I have worked in factories and warehouses, mostly male environments where weakness is punished mercilessly. So, my best advice is be careful who you admit your fear to and try all you can to overcome it. Believe me, i know how difficult it seems, but you must try at all times to reinforce the positives of being unafraid in your own mind. Do not, ever, let your fear conquer you. Be brave and good luck to you.|`|xXDkTJcWaa	I am just like that and im 13. I am horrified of anything flies by my face. Now if you don't like killing bugs then i wouldn't take this advice.

fwWO14fIaa	yeah eating the wrong foods can make you feel less energetic, so when it comes round to training, it will feel alot harder than if you just stuck to a good diet. drinking lots of water, eating alot of vitamins and minerals from veg/fruit, and eating lean meats will keep you in good shape till you train next time.|`|0MODZ0Iwaa	very important- performance is not just how fast you naturall are- eating poorly can hinder that

I worked off twenty five pounds, it definitely does work!
f0rYYrPhaa	well i think you might be pregnant, you should try a pregnancy test. and the discharge is normal you get in before and after the period but if it's milky white or yellowish and has an odor then you can have a uti or gonorrhea, definatly try going to a clinic or getting a preg test.
dM1IsKdZaa	You simply have to burn more calories than you take in. That's it. I didn't say easy, I said SIMPLE. You need to exercise 20-30 minutes most days of the week. Go to a website like freedieting.com and determine your calorie needs. Eat several small meals a day- and always eat breakfast (whole wheat toast with peanut butter, oatmeal,  some eggs and fruit, etc). Eat more fruits and vegetables.<br>      You really should feed yourself something small and healthy every couple of hours (apple, handful of nuts, yogurt, etc) to keep your metabolism going- if your body doesn't get food very often (like the way you are eating), it thinks it's starving and makes it harder to lose weight.<br>      Write down everything you eat- I bet you are eating way more than you realize. Stay away from fad diets, watch portion size and watch liquid calories (coke, fruit juices, etc). Indulge in an occasional sweet treat or you'll likely gorge.You should set goals; a healthy pace to lose weight is about 1-2 pounds a week. Good luck and use spellcheck next time. please.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	** consuming.<br>  <br>  Eating breakfast helps your metabolism, so no.<br>  You won't lose lbs faster.<br>  <br>  Also, you need to eat a minimum of 1300 calories a day to actually properly lose weight.<br>  Or you'll just gain all that lovely weight back.|`|bwpU9G2Taa	Your body needs, if I'm not mistaken, about 2,000-2,500 calories a day. And if you want to lose weight, counting calories really does help; keep track of what you eat, make sure you get a sufficient sugar, fat, and cholesterol intake.<br>  Depending on certain exercises you do, you will need a higher calorie intake.<br>  <br>  Don't skip meals; it's a common misconception that if you eat less, you'll lose weight. On the contrary: your metabolism will begin to lessen, seeing as how you're taking in less food to digest and process for vitamins, nuitrients, minerals, and energy.  If you were to go back to eating regularly, your body wouldn't be able to process your food as quickly and effectively as it used to. Therefore, I encourage you to eat 3 square meals a day (or 5 smaller meals, that way, you won't always be hungry much). This way, you keep your metabolism at it's current best.<br>  <br>  Also, alongside eating right, I suggest you exercise at least about half an hour a day. Jogging is good cardio, along with aerobics. Doing light workouts will also help you burn calories, as well as help keep your metabolism steady, seeing as how you're using your energy.<br>  I usually feel good after working out, despite the slight exhaustion. Also, you will be more energetic than you were before, if you choose to start working out.<br>  <br>  I posted a site that will show some great workouts, as well as show you which workouts target certain muscles.<br>  <br>  Hope I was of help :]<br>  -Daveybear;|`|bS3f0f1paa	no, not necessarily. You can't skip meals because then your metabolism won't get any faster. they actually say to eat 7 times a day. (small meals of course) and women are supposed to try and drink up to 80oz. of water a day. It will help speed up your metabolism. as well as trying to get at least 20 min. of exercise a day.|`|9QeV07zJaa	The general idea of eating breakfast is to jump start your energy. <br>  So eat breakfast and start doing stuff.  Most people will say their weight loss success was because of physical activities, not dieting.|`|SqX9dGRWaa	ok u should only be havin really small breakfasts really small lunches and really small dinners and than ull get skinny o ya and excersizing wouldnt hurt|`|RJdWIHR7aa	Yeah that's what ive been doing, well ive stopped now but it did work. ill email you. :)|`|g8pRhElsaa	the lesser amount of calories is good, but the metabolism effect is bad. the faster your metabolism is, the easier it is to burn calories and lose weight. if you wait to eat until dinner, your metabolism will be really slow, so it would actually be healthier to skip the later meals rather than the earlier ones.<br>  <br>  plus if you're starving around dinner time, you might be more likely to eat something unhealthy.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|uJpmd7G5aa	yea i mean you could do that <br>  <br>  and while your doing that just exercise or jog, that will help it a lot!

They all have eczema. Just have a bottle in every room of your home & put it on whenever you have a few minutes or as you're walking by. Put aveeno or any other moisturizer on your hands & wear gloves when you go to bed. I did that for my feet & it takes a little getting used to, sleeping with socks or gloves on, but it's not as icky sticky as I thought it would be & it really helps. My feet have not been this soft & smooth in a long time. :P<br>  You could also try a colloidal silver salve. I used it for my daughter's severe eczema on her face & it worked, not immediately & you have to keep moisturizing, but it does help & it was better than the alternative of harsh anti-inflammatory medicines.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	I haven't found one yet.  There are some things that help though.  Put the cream on (Aveeno, as another replied), directly out of the shower or bathtub, it will trap some moisture in and work a bit better.  Watch the soap you use, stay away from perfumes or scents...pumpkin patch soap from the Rocky Mountain Soap Factory is great.  Eat melons, especially watermelon and canteloupe.  You could also try calendula washes and lotions, if you can find a thick paste this stuff is dynamite...I can't find it anymore so I can't give you a brand name on that one.  Finally, be aware that a big part of the problem here is your skin has a natural tendancy to allow bacteria in so wash your hands often with a non-irritating soap (like the pumpkin patch soap) and apply the lotion again.|`|VCUc4k70aa	Common understanding is that there is no cure.

I didn't say easy, I said SIMPLE. You can't spot reduce fat. You need to exercise 20-30 minutes most days of the week. Go to a website like freedieting.com and determine your calorie needs. Eat several small meals a day.Eat more fruits and vegetables. Feed yourself something small and healthy every couple of hours (apple, handful of nuts, yogurt, etc) to keep your metabolism going and to prevent ravenous hunger. Write down everything you eat- I bet you are eating way more than you realize. Stay away from fad diets, watch portion size and watch liquid calories (coke, fruit juices, etc). Indulge in an occasional sweet treat or you'll likely gorge.You should set goals; a healthy pace to lose weight is about 1-2 pounds a week. Good luck.

He never did have a relapse and I'm not sure you do relapse after it.. It's the Epstein-Bar Virus, which is one of the herpesviruses, that causes this illness. But,if you are feeling fine once again and it's been about 6 to 8 weeks after your illness, then you can resume all your normal activities. Any sooner than that could cause the spleen to rupture even if it wasn't too swollen.  As far as relapsing, I doubt you need to worry about that unless you have an impaired immune system..
