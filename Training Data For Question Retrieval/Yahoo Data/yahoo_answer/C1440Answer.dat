W6DLQ8VYaa	What does he like to do? What are his interests? That can give you a good idea....    Since you have only been dating a couple of months, you will probably want to keep it light.    Cookies are always good - you could make heart shaped cookies or decorate them. Chocolate is always a good idea too. :)    Lou Malnati's (Chicago deep dish pizza) has heart shaped pizza you can send anywhere in the country... may be a little bit more expensive (around $30) but I'm sure a guy can't say no to deep dish pizza. :)    You could also make a box of cut out hearts with reasons why you like him, inside jokes, etc. That way he can open one up and think of you.    Does he wear cologne? If not, you could buy him a scent you like. Fun boxers are also a fun idea... they have red ones and valentine's boxers at various stores... I believe I found some at Express or Gap before.    One year, I made a valentine's card for him and wrote him a message using candy hearts to fill in parts of the message.    Honestly, Valentine's day isn't as big of a gift-giving holiday as others, more about spending time with each other. Don't stress too much about it - the fact that you're giving him anything will say something, and he will be happy to spend the time with you!    Good luck! :)|`|Nl64RmRWaa	I like the scrapbook idea someone answered about.    You could also bake him something. Guys love to eat! Make him a heart-shaped cake, and frost it with something cute on it. Like an, "I love you". Or you could make him cupcakes, cookies, or anything else of that sort. Decorate whatever you make with a Valentine's Day theme and it'll be perfect!    You could also get him a special card, and on the inside write the main reasons why you love him. That would mean a lot to him, and it comes from the heart.     You could make a collage. It's a bit easier than a scrapbook, so it might be best since you have a time limit. Get all the pictures you have of eachother and connect them on a poster. He could hang it up in his room and it'd be very nice.    Have a happy Valentine's Day!|`|tnMIzdeBaa	How about putting together a scrapbook of your photos -- maybe include ticket stubs to concerts or sporting events, notes you've written to each other, that sort of thing. It's something you could do without a lot of strain. you could also do the same thing on a large piece of poster board.    Good luck and Happy Valentine's Day!    Best -- Victoria R.

Thing is, it wouldn't matter what country they live in if they don't like themselves.  It's like that lyric in the old 60s song by Paul Revere and The Raiders called "Kicks"....

AA11618168	If it is love you will know it lickity split|`|WvzS59FKaa	Real Love whether your a lesbian or not is the same!    Love is wanting to give what is best for the one loved even when it entails great sacrifice.  Forgetting yourself and doing things that will lead that person to goodness, love and peace of mind ( which money cannot buy)    Love goes beyond wanting the best for him/her not just at the present moment but for tomorrow until eternity most especially the soul because that continues to live until eternity.    So just imagine if that person you love goes to hell, what great pain you would be causing, so real love whatever background you have is doing things always for the good of that one loved until eternity.|`|gcm6rEreaa	love doesn't have a gender.|`|20d09b00f62ad79a5e4a77484ecead92aa	The same if I were straight?

l8yfpyy1aa	I wasn't able to download the zshare files.    The first youtube selection is a two-year-old kid (of Chinese or Japanese background) learning to say "whatever ..." with American intonation and gestures, from a native speaker of American English.  It's a casual expression meaning "I don't really care ..."    The second youtube selection shows a two-or-three-year-old child trying to tell his father that the baby has blood on his face.  For the sake of the video, the father is pretending not to understand him, although everyone's American English is perfectly clear.  Poor kid ...     The third youtube shows baby Charlie and his three-year-old brother Harry, who reacts predictably but peaceably when Charlie tries out his teeth on his brother's finger.  He talks like a British kid from an ordinary middle-class background, not speaking Oxford-type English.  To the right on the youtube page are more videos of Charlie and his family for you to listen to.

AA11481224	wow these answers stink    as far as the awkward tension when one of you left to pee. not sure never really had to deal with that    and your husband was the jerk for not returning earlier or answering his phone.    talk to him and apologize if  need be. though not really sure for what other than not leaving with your husband. and maybe over staying your welcome|`|ST7WcWfsaa	Madam,    This shouldn't happen again, as it may become a habit, eventually leading to some sort of affair. That is not something your husband will tolerate dear. Please, try to avoid this in future & keep your husband aware of this. Most importantly, avoid it.

URHkLqeKaa	Not only is it offensive but I believe it was an attempt by your service adviser to make the guy feel guilty about not fixing the car at your dealership. With this economic downturn that is happening and the difficulty that car dealerships are having selling car, it is refreshing to see that people who work in car dealerships continue being the same jerks that they have always been.|`|QIQNzE11aa	Highly offensive. If he'd been white, would you be asking this question? If he was a man and said this about women would you be asking this question? It honestly doesn't matter what race either party is, a service person does not say this to a potential client. It loses the company money and offends the client to say the least.     This person can have any number of reasons they declined. All valid. The problem is this.... the customer will not come back to your dealership again. Probably not even for a car when they are ready to purchase again. They may even tell other family and friends to not go there and tell this story. Word of mouth is everything.     That person should be taken out of any customer service to say the least, but letting them go would be by far the best solution. An apology, a free something to this person with an explanation that the offensive person has been let go. These are the only ways to possibly get that potential customer back.|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	It's offensive because  1 it assumes that all African-Americans are the same and that's an unfair assumption.  2 it's offensive because he doesn't know the man's financial situation.  Maybe he couldn't afford it at that time but in a few days or weeks he'd be able to.  So he's planning to bring the car back at another time when he can afford it.  Or maybe he has a personal mechanic who could do the job for a lower cost.  Either way it's none of the service advisor's business and it's offensive to assume that the guy is being cheap--just because of his skin color.|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	Of course it was offensive. It was a total insult to the customer and he was right to lodge a complaint.|`|130e0733e4248f7f06961dce1ec109c2aa	It was a generalization, which are not true to the point of 100% exactness. One can be offended by the truth, just as easily as by a false statement.|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	Yes, that was offensive|`|dST3XrkNaa	I think based on the way he spoke, his tone and expression might make it offensive, else it can be taken as a generic statement.|`|2FNfyxVqaa	It is offensive only if you want to be offended. He is right though|`|4eTyCuRSaa	Seems like it would be an offensive comment to imply the customer was "cheap" regardless of this race,|`|AORcLwTNaa	idk|`|7M9X2QRgaa	That would be an offensive thing to say to anyone.|`|PDJ8cy68aa	The customer is way too sensitive here. Lighten up! Dennis simply said something...he doesn't need to take it personally.|`|REC4YgOuaa	The statement may be offensive, but it is true.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I would have gone to the general manager too because first of all, don't tell me what I should do with my car or my money especially when the dealership will charge you 2 and 3 times the amount to fix it and second of all, that's just an ugly thing to say to anyone, period, especially when it's not true.  My family lives at the dealership even though there are several mechanics in my family.  Even if it's just an oil change for crying out loud!|`|RoqxGbgRaa	his statement, although it uses race as its basis, is actually offensive beyond race.      the service advisor presumed to speak to the customer in a rather intimate way, forgetting to respect the distance that should be maintained in client/customer relationships.  whatever the advisor thought personally about the relationship between his fellow blacks and their upkeep of luxury cars (or lack thereof), when the customer declined, he should have smiled politely and sent the customer on his way.

It is unhealthy to be exposed to babies waste and diapers.  Some people have no pride and are low class. Those are the type of people that do those things.  And, yes, there are perverts out there that look at baby body parts in inappropriate ways.

Do you think you didn't make nasty smelling diapers?    I get that sometimes it would be easy to find another spot to do such things, but it isn't always.  Sometimes, the baby is crying, people are getting angry and the mom just wants some peace and quiet.  Sometimes there's no where better to go.  And even if there is, is it really so terrible?    I don't have kids myself (yet) but I've changed so many diapers for friends, family, etc., I mean, I just don't see what the problem is.  It's over in a minute.  It's far grosser to watch someone blow their nose and then check out their tissue (to me) than to see someone quickly change a diaper.    Lou:  I'm guessing that you're a man here.  Because it is always the men that complain about nursing.  These beautiful things are not only for men's enjoyment.  You never hear western men complain about low cut tops, but nursing mothers?  Heaven preserve us.|`|mxIYhkAnaa	Yes, it should.    How many women are staring at the auwrah of my babyboy to see if we have done khitaan... YES WE DID IT WHEN HE WAS ONE DAY OLD, ALHAMDULILLAAH, MASHA ALLAAH.    When i take him seperate (also with breastfeeding), they find it it extreme... "How could i give a evil eye to such lovely baby?" You just did... If it is the evil eyes, the women would make him infertile by baby... Hasboen Allaah.    I did it aswell with my daughter, and once had seen the male doctor her auwrah to check for female khitaan practises. UNFORTUNATELY for him, she isn't done. But i think it is a preparation for the future, even her father isn't allowed to look at it. Let aside if you would see her behaviour with non mahram men.

If they won't tell you, discuss this with your pastor.|`|XxPhbwNfaa	Rumor-mongers abound in any group where jealousy and righteousness are present.  Churches are the perfect place simply because there are so many people that consider themselves as the prime example of perfection as members.  It may not be you that is the subject of the rumor.  It may be your husband.....  Uh-oh, I hope I haven't started a rumor here.      There will always be busybodies who are convinced that they can fix the world, one family at a time.  If you don't want someone fixing your world, then fix it yourself, or find a new one.  There are a dearth of churches even in small town USA.  I lived many years in a town of 4000 that had 4 bars, and 15 churches.  When everybody knows everybody else's business,  there will still be those who think it is their personal gift, to fix other's problems.|`|pPJQ7ZANaa	Hi there... I just read your question ... I think the rumor-mill is just what it is.  RUMORS.  I think you should set the record straight.  Maybe over tea with the ladies at your church and just say something about the rumors being spread and the falseness of them.  Keep it light and simple and do not let these people get the best of you.  They are jealous of something ... either you, your husband, or your marriage.    Good luck.   It's sad that people who go to church regularly should be there to learn the work of God.  Starting rumors is not a very Christian-like thing to do.    Remember:   People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.    PS:  you might find a different church to go to... the one you're going to now doesn't sound very friendly... and this person who suggested you go up in front of the congregation to have your marriage prayed for is either quite ignorant of you and your marriage, but also quite ignorant of how to behave in a church.      i'm really sorry to hear about someone going thru something like this... it's really pretty sad...|`|r0DDXSrJaa	Next time you go to church, wear a disguise and try to get close to the enemy, then you will know for sure what they are plotting concerning you.|`|REC4YgOuaa	maybe you should find another church.|`|QIQNzE11aa	I'd say that church isn't a very good one if they kick people out of it. Are only the really good people allowed in? they are not the ones who need church the most. And anyone listening to and acting upon rumor has more problems than worth.     When someone asks to pray for your marriage, i'd stop and ask them why they feel the need. If they do not answer, laugh a little and say thank you but many people have problems that need praying over and your marriage doesn't qualify.     Running around and trying to find out rumors and trying to deal with them will never work. There once was a rumor that i was sleeping with my neighbor. Many chose to not believe in it knowing the type of person i am. Had i ran to those idiots who wanted to spread it and denounce it, i would not have been believed. My marriage and his proved far more in the long run.     His child was born with major medical problems that the doctors, still after a year later, cannot figure out. He would come over, with my husbands and his wife's full knowledge, to use my computer. He would surf the medical sites and email every hospital and doctor throughout the world to help them. They didn't have a computer, they had to sell it to buy formula, and they couldn't afford internet with all the medical costs building up. I work at home,  and have two computers that are online at all times. I am always busy working and have little time to even chat with him. To me and my husband, it was no different than having a male employee at the other desk. he did his thing and i did mine. Never would it have dawned on me that people could be so facious. In the end, they looked badly and i did not. All who knew me stood by me. Any who did not, are no longer my friends and i realized, they never were really my friends.     Leave this go. Prove your marriage is fine by still being together in a few years from now. Maybe... just maybe.. think about finding a less judgemental church? Find one that makes you feel good about being there, find one that helps those who needs help and not just looking for problems where none lies. Find one that has compassion for people and teaches love and not judgement and then throws people away. I'm certain you love your church and do not want to think of leaving it. I am also certain i'll face some of your wrath for saying this. But i think you need to really stop and take a look. These people aren't accepting you, they are judging you.     Who listens to gossip? Another gossip. If you lie down with dogs, you'll end up with fleas... that comes to mind in all of this. how can they teach you to be better if they themselves are not following the word of God to NEVER judge another? Would God be ok sitting around with people who were spreading gossip? If the minister (or by whatever title) also listens and also makes a choice like this.... is this God's will? Is this what God would want you to learn?     If you chose to stay, if you chose to accept their faults, you won't be a bad person in any way. Just don't play into the game. If you ignore it all and keep your head up and your marriage looking solid, they'll find someone else to gossip about next. That you want to run around putting out fires they started will only give them more energy to continue to pick on you.

dPJr1Lbmaa	Done sister. Every year I give to Red nose day on the BBC, but not this year. As long as they refuse to show appeals for Gaza I wont ever be giving them anything in Charity again. Why is it OK to raise money for children in need in Africa and the UK but not those also in dire need in Gaza? There is no difference and as long as the BBC makes it different they wont be getting a penny out of me.  I have other ways to give to charity to Children in the UK and Africa without doing it through the BBC. Children in Need, Red nose Day? Never again! They can forget it!      This is where my charity money will be going...  http://www.interpal.info/about-us/how-we...|`|zmmP52P3aa	I'm all out of rockets and bombs so I have nothing to give them that they want.|`|ChQYiLhPaa	They should show the Palestinian appealing for help.

Do you think that you'd rather be sexually intimate with a Man or a Woman, and possibly more importantly, would you rather be in a relationship with a dude or a chick?  There's no right or wrong answer here, and if you decide you'd rather be with a guy, then that's completely 100% natural, and if you'd rather be with a woman, then it's natural to have thoughts about people of your sex, even if you know you'll never act on them.    It's closer to about 7-10% of the population that are 'gay', so you're not alone, nor do you you have to fit in to any stereotypes to be either gay or straight.

Say: "It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path."    22. Say (O Muhammad ): "None can protect me from Allah's punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor should I find refuge except in Him.    23. "(Mine is) but conveyance (of the truth) from Allah and His Messages (of Islamic Monotheism), and whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the Fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever ."    24. Till, when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who it is that is weaker concerning helpers and less important concerning numbers.    25. Say (O Muhammad ): "I know not whether (the punishment) which you are promised is near or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term.    26. "(He Alone) the All-Knower of the Gha'ib (unseen), and He reveals to none His Gha'ib (unseen)."    27. Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of unseen as much as He likes), and then He makes a band of watching guards (angels) to march before him and behind him.  ____________    The Prophet sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam said, 'The keys of the unseen are five, Allaah alone knows them. Allaah alone knows what the wombs contain, no one knows what will be on the morrow but Allaah, and you do not know what land you will die but Allaah, and no one knows when the last hour will come but Allaah.' [Transmitted by Bukhaaree, Muslim, Ahmad]    ________________  "And who is more astray than one who invokes besides Allaah, such as will not answer him on the day of judgement, and who (in fact) are unconscious of their call to them?" Qur'aan 47:5 (see also, (7: 191-198), (10:2)  __________  (Allaah subhanahu wa ta'ala says in the Quran:) "Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which we have revealed unto thee, before this, neither thou nor the people knew them.

Shias has invented their own meaning of this word    Shias has also changed the meaning of many ayah of quran     the ayah about the wives of prophet (saw),misinterpreted and wives have been excluded from AHL BAYT    As they believe in 12th imam ,infallible .so they took all the interpretation done by so called Imam.    Shias took the word * IMAM* from the quran but giving it their own meaning ,and built whole methodology on this word|`|hl6lDPvDaa	Hadith Al-Kisa (Narration of the Cloak) is the narration of an incident where the Prophet Mohammed (saw) gathered Ali, Hassan, Hussayn and Fatema (peace be upon them all) under his cloak and announced them as his Ahl (Family). It was then that the second part of verse 33:33 of the Holy Quran was revealed, known as "Ayat al-Tathir" (Verse of Purification), in which Allah states He has purified the Family of the Prophet (Ali, Hassan, Hussayn and Fatema), thus proving their infallibility.    This narration has been narrated by many people, including Umme Salma, Jabir ibn Abdullah Ansari, Ayesha, and Ibne Abbas. There are also various modifications and differences between the narrations of the different people. The most authentic version of Hadith Al-Kisa, according to the Shia, is that version which has been narrated by Jabir ibn Abdullah Ansari, all other versions have either been edited or are incomplete.|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	READ QURAN    QURAN SAYS THAT IMAMS ARE ALWAYS APPOINTED BY ALLAH AND THEY ARE INFALLIBLE    Quran  2:124] And remember that Abraham was tried by his Lord with certain commands, which he fulfilled: He said: "I will make thee an Imam to the Nations." He pleaded: "And also (Imams) from my offspring!" He answered: "But My Promise is not within the reach of evil-doers."  Note: Not evil-doers means sinless--Sinless=infallible|`|uuUd5Zidaa	A few brothers have already posted the ayats to which Allah refers to Imams and their infallibility (the purification aya and so on)    If you are genuinely seeking knowledge about this particular concept, i highly recommend reading Imamate and Leadership by Lari. It consists of Quran verses and their explanation. It tells you the logical perspective of the role of an Imam.    Ofcourse there are things in the Quran that hint off the concept of Imamate. For instance the word Imam (and words with the root word of Imam) are mentioned 12 times in the Quran.  The Quran mentions about a believer who gives zakaat during their prayer,   " It is God and His Messenger alone who are you wali, and those who establish prayers and regular charity and bow down humbly in worshipi (5:56)  and there is only person in the history of the world that did so, Imam Ali (AS) was in sajjdah, and a poor man came up behind him, and Ali gave him his ring.    From a Shia perspective the concept of Imamate is all over the Quran. For instance, in the Quran is says "O believers, obey the commants of God, the Messenger and the Holders of Authority." (4:58)|`|mVSC9aKoaa	no!    Quran does not say directly that Mohammed PBUH is infallible. However, there is logical reason to believe that Mohammed PBUH is infallibe.  Quran command us to obey and follow him. Now, if he make mistake this can misguide whole humanity. Actually this is Allah SW who protect Mohammed PBUH from sins, it is not his own attribute.    Edit: Padrim, purify does not necessitate infallibility.    Edit: Adnan illiteracy does not necessitate fallibility.

My Knowledgable shia brother pedram   Gives you the best answer   but read this also     --------------------------------------...      They all were from the same Divine Light, out of which The Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) was created from.   Like The Holy Prophet(pbuh) they all were special personalities in matter of knowledge, forbearance, moral excellence, justice, high moral standards and other intellectual achievements as being the successors of The Holy Prophet(pbuh&hf) and Leaders and Divine Guides for all mankind.   --------------------------------------...  Sadly of all the Twelve Infallible Holy Imams(as), Eleven of them have been murdered, either by the sword or by poisioning.   It has been narrated by The Holy Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf). That even the last of the Infallible Holy Twelve Imams(as), the Imam Mehdi Al-Muntader(as) will also be murdered after he had accomplished his divine quest.     By ridding the world of all miseries and injustice. Then he will establish Justice, and human rights to all mankind!    Even The Holy Prophet Mohammad(pbuh&hf), himself wasn't spared, and was poisioned by a Jewish old woman, who he later, unconditionaly freed and forgave.     Soon after The Prophet's(pbuh&hf) death, his beloved daughter the Lady Fatimah Al-Zahra(as) was also killed due to the blow she recived to her chest breaking her ribs, causing her sevear internal bleeding and misscarriage of her unborn baby.|`|XE4n4VRtaa	How could a illiterate man be infallible?    The people who make these claims follow circular logic.|`|AA11648578	Magic of Dawn tells you a truth you do not want to know.  The Qu'ran itself has Allah instructing Muhammad to pray for forgiveness of his sins,  Christ is perfect righteous and Holy the Gospel and the Word of God.  According to the Qu'ran.  Islam teaches against the Qu'ran calling the word of God corrupt.    Edit    S 22:52. Never did We send an apostle or a prophet before thee, but, when he framed a desire, Satan threw some (vanity) into his desire: but Allah will cancel anything (vain) that Satan throws in, and Allah will confirm (and establish) His Signs: for Allah is full of Knowledge and Wisdom:     53. That He may make the suggestions thrown in by Satan, but a trial for those in whose hearts is a disease and who are hardened of heart: verily the wrong-doers are in a schism far (from the Truth):       Here's what the true word of God says about prophets that speak the words of Satan,    But a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything I have not commanded him to say, or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods, must be put to death. Deuteronomy 18:20 (NIV)|`|FhXzlnDOaa	I know there are ahadith that say Muhammad had to pray for forgiveness and one even says 70 times a day.    The quran DOES say Jesus is perfect.  It got that right!    019.019   YUSUFALI: He said: "Nay, I am only a messenger from thy Lord, (to announce) to thee the gift of a holy son.   PICKTHAL: He said: I am only a messenger of thy Lord, that I may bestow on thee a faultless son.   SHAKIR: He said: I am only a messenger of your Lord: That I will give you a pure boy.

3E2EQH12aa	there are a LOT of nice things on youtube.. aside from that, i have ordered my kids the "adam's world" dvds, as well as some things from sister Noor of "noor art"..|`|tUSOzNdBaa	That is because they usually aren't Muslim. They don't usually have a problem with dogs and pigs. But, the wine is definitely a bad thing to show on Sesame Street. I didn't know they did that!|`|4jOaN0WIaa	I think you are reading too much into it.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	There is nothing wrong with touching a pig or a dog. We are not eating the pig by touching it, we can clean ourselves after before praying.  Pigs and dogs are Allah's creation also and to be respected as such. I mean its not like there are pigs wandering around the high streets of England for my child or me to touch but if I took them to a petting zoo, I would allow them to touch a pig just as I would let them touch a donkey or a cow or a goat.   Pigs are not to be detested, they have there purpose in this life, just because them being part of our permissible food is not one of them does not mean my child cannot learn nursery rhymes with Piggy in it or touch one at a petting zoo.    I agree with the wine thing though not appropriate for children or a children's show whether the children are Muslim or not that is just wrong!|`|zmmP52P3aa	"Now i am recording these televisionshows and i adopt only the things that are "halaal" for a child of 4 years to see... "    Like the giant mouse on Palestinian TV who exhorts kids to kill jews?|`|EAuMJrs4aa	check this link out title of the top result suites a lot of the people in islam    http://www.amazon.ca/Son-Fanatic-Widescr...|`|4INE794zaa	Pigs and dogs ARE nice animals, that can be touched. Perhaps that is why they are shown. As Seasame Street originated in the US, and one of Jim Henson's first Muppet creations was a dog, and a pig (Ralph and Miss Piggy) it makes perfect sense. Dogs are family pets in North America. Part of the family. Pet, touched, loved. Pigs, are also kept as pets in many families, until its time to eat them.   Now, about the wine. My children know I drink it. They also know I can have a glass of wine with my dinner, or while relaxing, because I am an adult. I am raising my children correctly, so I am not worried at all about what Seasame Street has to say about dinner accompaniments.   I don't allow my children to watch Anime, but you will not find me complaining that it contains things I don't agree with. Same goes for Sponge Bob or the Simpsons. If it contains things I don't agree with, they don't watch it. It isn't fair of you to come on here and judge how the rest live.|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	Dogs are mans best friend.  For thousands of years, dogs have helped us hunt, guarded our homes, and even helped raise our children.  All of the dogs I ever had were wonderful companions and loyal friends.  They are eager to please and very obedient.  A world without dogs to accompany you on your walk through life would be a very poor world indeed.    It's a hallmark of all cults to prohibit intoxicants.  Wine loosens the tongue, and people say things they wouldn't normally say.  Things like "Hey, I think Muhammad is full of. . .!"  Cult leaders usually fit a personality profile that includes abstinance from intoxicants and a complete intolerance for those who do not abstain.  Muhammad was no different in this regard.    Wine is nothing to fear.  When properly made it has a pleasant taste and adds to the flavor of the food it accompanies.  Anything may be abused if used in excess. If you treat it as commonplace, there is very little tendedncy to abuse it.  The first miracle Jesus did was to turn water into wine (the fables you hear in Islam of Jesus' childhood are just that: Christian fables that Muhammad couldn't distinguish from real scripture).    It's so sad for you that you let your prejudices prevent you from some of the finer things i life, and sadder still that you have to indoctrinate your poor children to the same cultural poverty.|`|85d71407259116146825d96515f378bcaa	There is a Hadith that says 'Angels will not enter the house where the dog is'. Hence we don't keep dogs as pets.  A believer should be clean internally and externally as we standup before Allah in prayer. These animals are known for their dirt and the many deadly diseases associated with them. They have the habit of sleeping late at night and sex with anyone. (Most of the qualities those who walk behind and eat these animals have in common).   However dogs are allowed in certain cases for a purpose  as hunting or protection etc. Holy Quran refers in Surah Al-Kahf, about a dog that accompanied the believers and stood for their protection. There is in Hadith also an incident where an immoral woman was forgiven her sins for quenching the thirst of a dog.   The American style of feeding the pet dog milk and biscuits while the aged Mommy and daddy is in old-mens' orphanage with none to look after. They have totally a different style with dogs and pigs which of course we cannot follow. So go with whats safe for your kids to learn with and what your heart feel is safe for their real future.  When you close a door of evil, Allah will open a door of good for you. Until then we will not know we were missing the otherside of this life. Like the one who abstain musics and plays of this life. Allah will fill his heart the sweetness of faith and listening to Holy Quran far sweeter. There are the sugar coated things of this life and things where in is sugar. Islam takes you to the second, to that which is true in sweet but may not to the external eyes. Somethings are somtimes externally sour but sweet inside. Onlyexperiance can tell and the words may fail.|`|bZM4R2gDaa	Yes sister that is why I would say keep ur homes free of Television. I no most people argue about it saying we can watch good things in it but trust me the evil in it is is far greater in it then the good nowadays. Until when r u gonna supervise ur kid watching TV. kids r inquisitive & they will learn their ways of trying to watch wat they want when ur not around, it's not the bad tarbiyah but we r human being & we r bound to do mistakes& they r much easier & more tempting to the Nafs.  The Fitnah TV has bought into the Mulsim homes with the dish connection is unbelievable & we don't seem to worry about this. Wat we watch, hear & see all have on effect in our daily lives & no human being can deny it. No wonder u see Muslim kids know more nowadays about cartoon characters& celebraties then the Sirah of Rasulullah(s), the sahabah& the Islaamic history. & we r helping them to learn about them more then our true heros & then we cry if our child turns out like the Kuffar. Wat can u expect from a western media except the corruption of the nofoos(soul) for them it is ok coz they r used to it but for us it is not.   I don't have TV at home & I don't deprive my kids, I give them a limited time to watch wat I know is ok for them on the computer. I as a parent am responsible over my kids & I must make sure wat I'm giving them is good for them & at the same time does not contradict with the teachings of Islaam.We must do our best, make duwa & keep faith on Allah that he will inshallah guide them.  Allah knows best.|`|7KyYzytbaa	honey , u dont really have to worry about that , if u taught ur children the islamic rules , and there's no prob at all to start doing that earlier..    i remember when i was a kid i used to see all these things , but "thu " i was very young , i knew what's wrong and what's right , cuz my parents taught me..    i was able to differentiate between our culture & islamic rules and the western culture ..    so just be there with them , teach them good morals and dont worry..    may allah help u and bless ur kids and all muslims , ameen..    love & peace from islam..

YZv8Ub3Haa	Plenty of creationists are already denying their own kids the right to an education.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Well there's a good idea!  You probably claim that seeing homosexuality as a behavior that should not be endorsed by society is from ignorance or only belief in the Old Testament.  SO, remove the right to an education... can we say self-defeating?    Oh, wait... that's right, you're just being a bratty kid yourself, since you don't really want an answer... you don't really care that marriage does not mean legal rights, that legal rights can be gotten other ways without forcing people to accept homosexual behavior, or that education actually IS a civil right.    Well, here's a pat on the head for being a brat, here's your cookie, I'll take my two points and watch you pick the person who says "that's a great point!"     Here's a clue.  We don't deny them the right to marry.  We restrict the ability to marry whoever you want based on the beliefs of the majority of the society.  Some of this is based in the OT.  MOST of this is based in what the majority believes is RIGHT for this society, no matter what the OT does or does not say.  For instance, there is no basis for restricting incest anymore, when it's two consenting adults.  Not unless you're going to require genetic testing on every married couple.  And yet it's still against the law.  There is no reason for restricting polygamy when they're consenting adults.  Yet that marriage isn't allowed either.  Society decides it.  Not the OT.    Add:  Here's another little thought to wrap your brain around.  If the US was restricting gay marriage ONLY because of the Old Testament, then how come there are many laws that go against bible teachings that people vote for or against?  Like, there was a girl who got on the ballot where I live a law that would have put a fetus as having the same rights as a baby.  The bible would support it.  It was voted strongly down.      No matter what you may want to tell yourself, people aren't voting against homosexual marriage JUST because of the bible.  There are obviously other reasons.|`|7TIw0wEcaa	Don't forget shell fish are an abomination to God and menstruating women are unclean and should not be touched. Homosexuals, criminals, and those who believe in more than one God are to be stoned.|`|cLgghhuXaa	There are also NT passages condemning homosexuality... and honestly denying a bratty kids the right to an education is tempting... but most brats are brats because they have not been taught better by their parents.|`|TKMuD3TPaa	Datex, you disgust me. The Old Testament is about the JEWS. Honestly! No one follows those rules perfectly, and it never said anything and menstruating women. Get your facts straight, please, before more craps comes out of that fat pie hole.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	This is without a doubt the silliest question that i've seen yet. The Old Testament does not "condemn" misbehaving children; it does however state  they should be held accountable for their actions. God says that homosexuality is an abomination before Him, how can you compare the two? Now if children are going to be held accountable for their   actions, how much more so will people that flaunt their homosexuality? Marriage is a Holy Covenant between a man and woman, like Adam and Eve not Adam and Steve.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	No, but you have the right to give him a good switchin.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Only if enough voters agree with you....    Besides, The New Testament Tells Women to keep their mouths shut, but we don't enforce that... should we?|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	Yeah... and I can stone my Christian sister for getting a divorce too!!!    What fun!|`|D1BNSf5uaa	Or to get really technical, stone them both.|`|IKyITYICaa	If we follow OT laws, then a person can be stoned to death for doing anything on Sunday.|`|bEeozqacaa	All people deserve the right to education & marriage|`|q5rTjkjgaa	or you can be like god and kill 42 children because they made fun of a bald man
2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Know what's stinks?  The assumption that the price a woman has to pay for independence is not having love or a husband...or that if a woman is married she doesn't get to have a say in terms of how money is spent.    All that either/or thinking is just crazy stuff straight out of the 1950s.    However, if I have to choose extremes, I'd rather be independent and have my own money than to be married and have to account for every cent I spend while the husband does whatever he wants and never tells the wife. I've been there, done that...and it's not fun...but it could've been worse.  I knew of women who didn't even know how much money their husbands made or even where they worked...and then if the husband walks out or dies, they're left in dire financial straits.    The ideal is that there should be a his, hers and ours bank accounts.  Both husband and wife have their own independent money so they do not have to be accountable each other for and neither feels like they have to come to the other cap in hand begging, and then have a common purse for the entire family's needs.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	I am - I pay my own way and whatever I have I earnt.  I love my life!!|`|ajPHMliqaa	women want it all ways|`|xvw8ePHIaa	I think it's very important for women to have their one money. It makes them independent which means they can decide whether or not they want to live with a man.   I feel good to be independent.|`|AA10389562	I think the happiest women are the ones who know they COULD be completely independent if they had to even if, at the present time, they prefer to be in a sharing relationship.|`|qrF5zTqMaa	women are like half the people in the world... i'm sure they have a variety of opinions...|`|s6b3RnsWaa	I wouldn't feel complete if my husband had that much control of mine and our kids lives.

D4XWrwuaaa	I don't know who he is, but he should be blown up.  KABOOM!
k4Z46Ni3aa	Honestly,yes,there are some people who are so cruel that they even curse,criticize,laugh at, and etc even talk about someones' dead mother of the deceased just like back in my junior high school year a boy talked mess about my murdered brother like it was funny and another boy talked mess too while I had a necklace with my brother's face,it got me so steamed up that I beat him up punching his head while he's on the floor trying to protect his self like a coward but I had to learn that's just how some people are like you're not going to find everyone nice and have something positive to say,have opinions regardless no matter how petty it is.People like those are just different,ignorant,and are haters who cant suite to others such as with Aaliyah,level.But don't worry,karma will come to them,even soon.They talk about dead celebs too,do you know the Mexican-American singer Selena?If you go on any of her videos on Youtube, almost so much comments about her are horrible like "she had huge ugly lips", "she's a beaner", "I like her but she has a cocky attitude","she's a ugly Mexican *****" when we all know any of that crap isn't true, so why care about the negativity of what other say? That is just life:-(    Um musica?Where did Adolf Hitler come in the picture lol?Don't mean to be a critic of what your opinion is but there are people who were inspired and happy that dead celebs like Aaliyah,Biggie,Left Eye Lisa, had represented for their hometowns which gives them love and respect and I'm not going to hate them for that.Bless their souls of the great music they made and brought to Rap and R&B.Just because they're deceased celebs that we never met nor had relations with,doesn't mean you should bash them saying they were inimportant than reading a book/newspaper and individuals shouldn't show their respects to them.Aaliyah was only an "example" too.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Just because someone dies, especially if that person was a public figure, it doesn't mean they are automatically DEIFIED, that they're somehow infallible or that they should be always be exempt from any sort of criticism ... especially if the criticism my actually be warranted.     Everyone is still entitled to their own opinions whether you like it or not.  Personally, I think you're taking your celebrity worship waaay too far here, and that is the kind of silly stuff that gives fandom a bad name...and makes you run the risk of being accused of not "having a life" yourself.    Try striking a balance here...    Let's use a different example to see if your argument holds up....     I wonder .... would you'd have the same attitude towards deceased people getting talked about if it was someone like Adolph Hitler? He's dead...should we suddenly just ignore that he was a despot who was responsible for the murders of over 6 million people? Oh, the Holocaust deniers would just love that!    EDIT    Jealous of what?  I personally don't care one way or another. It's just an example. Sheesh.      Man, I tell you, hard-core celebrity worshipping fanatics are just some of the STUPIDEST hard-headed but thin-skinned people on earth at times! I never said Aaliyah was a murderer. All I said was that NO ONE should be made out to be flawless simply because they are no longer amongst the living.     Good god, if you folks can't use your logic and figure out my analogy re: exercising extremes and irrational thoughts re: celebrity worship, then you're beyond hopeless!!!      Why don't you people try getting an education, actually opening a REAL book or a newspaper that isn't all about celebrities and realize that there's a big world out there with problems you'd be better off putting your energies towards solving? or better still just get some psychological counseling for your mental issues, the kinds of issues that cause you to attack others who refuse to join and blindly and unquestioningly follow your famous necrology cult!|`|92iuiuZKaa	Most people have respect for the dead. at least most of the people i associate with do|`|MNuS31nsaa	some people are jealous of successful people...even deceased ones. its sad. but we cant help jealousy. but we can hide it. some people just shouldnt bash people. as they say "jealousy isnt pretty"

9c0829fc04d30a907d2a9892ddd6eac6aa	Some but males are programmed differently.  As they biologically invest less in each conception, the ideal would be to impregnate many high quality females (deemed attractive/will care for kids well etc) as possible.      It is not as cut and dry as that though and there are many variables, males may wish to commit (ie get guarantee of exclusive mating rights from) to a high quality female.  Hence why women (given we all age) are treated like a depreciating asset.      Plus men also may want to optimise any experience (or sub-consciously pursue all opportunities to mate - including with low quality females) so the monogomous lifestyle might be harder.      In addition, the old promiscuous male being a stud and the promiscuous female being a number of disparaging terms, probably too has roots in our evolutionary drives.. ie men make a sub-conscious calculation as to probable paternity meaning if a woman is easy or sleeps around she is afforded much less long term (and even short term if you see the way they are treated in porn etc) respect..    SO - long and short of it - avoid the player type of bloke (bad blokes are NOT exciting they just know how to charm you into bed before they notch you as well as countless others up..), be smart and do NOT sleep around, be smart and NEVER sleep with a bloke for a good 3 months at least from when you start dating - that is a great way to work out who is or is not a player, the blokes left will be much higher quality.. also be smart and note what he DOES not what he says, sure he can say three little words but it is in his actions you will know if he is in for the long haul - men always find time to do what is important to them so if he rings on time, never lets you down, makes you feel good (and not just in the beginning) then he is a keeper, for your part, stand by your man, don't play games and be fun to be with.      Good luck - needle in a haystack hun. x|`|yBZlTzWLaa	I'm a guy, and I'd love to find a life partner (though I really don't know if it will be male or female).|`|r6fGmJK1aa	I think every one, gay or straight, when they get to a certain age, or point in their lives, will have the need for a life time companionship.  It is not just limited to hetero couples.      Having an open mind and diversity makes the world a wonderful place. We need to embrace every one, gay or straight, black or white, rich or poor.|`|nr1Bt47baa	I believe we do, that's what I've been doing at least. I think it might all come at different times for different guys. I don't think I was looking for life partners when I was in High School really. Once you get to a certain age you just kind of realize it's time to settle down.

brfdgZuyaa	I doubt it. You just have to take into account the maturity of your grade level, and she doesn't to be being serious at all. I mean you could ask her. But my friends and i act gay to each other or say 'love you baby' with texts but we dont mean it in a homosexual way at all. We are all very much straight. It just depends on how good of friends you are. But if she's gay? Oh well. Just make sure that she knows that you're not if you find out, and you should feel comfortable around her regardless.|`|vjVnpXcnaa	I would doubt it, I'm into girls, and i tease my straight girl friends about it all the time. I say "Yea Brandy, i love you!" and i blow her kisses, send her pictures on her phone, hold her hand. But seriously, a lot of straight girls do it to, doesn't make her gay but you never know. You could always ask her. But blowing kisses, psht, please, even guys do that to look like an Asss hole.|`|pWHNWdKGaa	I suppose there is the possibility but she really sounds like a normal girl.

For dinner make a nice pasta dish whatever you like with salad and bread    For dessert make a fondue if you have a small crock pot this works great then friuts and things in it and feed it to each other. You can make a fondue for dinner too.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	You could get her 11 roses, and then a single rose dipped in gold. Gold dipped roses are $50, but they are very beautiful and romantic.

Praise be to Allaah.   Undoubtedly making images of everything that has a soul is haraam, indeed it is a major sin, because of the stern warning against that narrated in the texts of the Sunnah; and because it is imitating Allaah in His creation of living things; and because it is a means that leads to temptation (fitnah) and that often leads to shirk. The one who takes the picture, the one who tells him to do it and those who help him to do it are all guilty of sin, because they are cooperating in sin, which Allaah has forbidden when He said:   but do not help one another in sin and transgression  [al-Maaidah 5:2]   And Allaah is the Source of strength.   Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah (Fatwas of the Standing Committee), 1/454   According to another fatwa issued by the Standing Committee (1/458):   It is not permissible to make pictures of animate beings using cameras or any other kind of image-making equipment, or to keep pictures of animate beings except in cases of necessity, such as pictures in identity documents or passports; it is permissible to take and keep such pictures because there is a need for that.  Islam Q&A    Printing childrens pictures on clothes   One of the shop keepers is offering a job which is: printing pictures of children on clothes etc., so that he can display them and sell them to people. What is the ruling on this?    Praise be to Allaah.  This work is not permissible because it involves printing pictures of animate beings on shirts that children will wear, so the pictures will be openly displayed on the chest of the person wearing the clothes. The Messenger (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Allaah has cursed the makers of images and Every maker of images will be in the Fire. It was reported that Aaishah, the wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) told him that she had bought a saddle-cushion on which there were images. When the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) saw it, he stood at the door and did not enter. [Aaishah said:] I could see in his face that he was displeased and I said O Messenger of Allaah, I repent to Allaah and His Messenger. What is my s in? The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: What is this saddle-cushion for? I said, I bought it for you so that you could sit on it and use it as a pillow. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, The makers of these images will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them, Bring to life that which you have created. And he said, The angels do not enter a house in which there are images. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 5181)  This includes all images, whether they are carved, engraved, printed, drawn or taken with a camera, because all kinds of image-making are included in the general meaning of the hadeeth. There are no exceptions, apart from cases of necessity or need such as photos for personal identity documents, which are essential. But the case which you have mentioned in your question is not included in this exception. So look for another kind of work which is halaal. We ask Allaah to make what He has permitted sufficient for us so that we will not need to look to what is haraam, and to make us independent by His grace.  May Allaah bless our Prophet Muhammad and his family and companions, and grant them peace.  For more information on the rulings concerning image-making, please see Questions   3243, 365, 1747   Islam Q&A   Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid    so u should not put a pic|`|FUFD3MhQaa	I would change it if I were you.|`|V20PTwMmaa	Avatars are best|`|YLQpcjQPaa	change it.|`|4FqnyIpSaa	it's your avatar, who cares what others think.

gecxVNuxaa	rolling stone (plural rolling stones)      noun   Definition: somebody with no roots: somebody who is incapable of staying in the same job or place for very long    [Originally in the proverb, "a rolling stone gathers no moss"]|`|i4ceTwqLaa	I CAN tell you that the Rolling Stones took their name from the Muddy Waters Song: "Rollin' Stone"    Whose lyrics appear here:    http://www.lyricsdownload.com/muddy-wate...    Also, Bob Dylan wrote "Like a Rollin Stone" due to the influence of this song.    The original etymology of the phrase "Rolling Stone" is from the old proverb: A rolling stone gathers no moss. (Meaning, it's good to move around a lot lest you get all mossy).|`|WgruZkHRaa	A rolling stone gathers no moss. I think it is taken from this phrase. It just means they get around|`|N9nJWYa5aa	The old phrase that a rolling stone gathers no moss.  If you think about it, then it's pretty self explanatory.

QIQNzE11aa	it is a very difficult time, in this economy, to ask for a raise.     You normally ask for a raise or get one during review time. If you have been working there and haven't had a review in over a year, you ask about one. State, i haven't had a review in such and such amount of time and i was wondering when my next one came due.     You can also go to your boss and ask him quite frankly. I was hoping we could discuss a possible raise, when would you have an opening to discuss this? Do NOT make demands. I don't know about what state you are in... but our hospital had 3 jobs come open in the mid of Jan. 1800 people applied.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Depends on how long you have been there and what others who do work similar to yours are making, also, you need to prove you deserve the raise, what you have brought to the job personally, any cross training you do and anything you have contributed that would justify a raise, and also how much of a raise.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	First you should find out if your company is doing well in this economy.  If they are cutting corners, that lessens your chances.  Particularly you should be interested in they net profits from last year, should be available on a company web site.    Second you have to give them good reasons why they should give you a raise.  You've done x, y, and z.  You've recently rec'd a degree, you worked on a difficult project that brought money in to the company, you've gotten a letter of thanks from your customers?    You have to give them good reasons why you want a raise and what you've done to deserve one.  It's hard to ask for a raise but all they can say is no.  Good luck!|`|r0DDXSrJaa	Jump up on a desk or other podium-like-item and scream at the top of your lungs, "SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!!"|`|xnsU60hhaa	Schedule an appointment with your boss for a wage review.

Although being sexually attracted to someone doesn't matter (especially with the fact that I'm only 15) I still remember that because in order to love someone (as horrible as this sounds) science has proven that lust is an essential step.

P544Sbmqaa	Its not homophobic, but its uneducated and border line bigotry.  As many other people have mentioned, there are many unbiased, peer reviewed studies that show having same sex parents does NOT harm the child in anyway.  And as other people mentioned as well, every signle family situation as the potential to screw up a child, so....     Why do you assume kids would bully the child of a same sex couple??  I would assume that most same sex parents would socialize with other same sex couples and families who support it.  Only a child growing up in a bigotted home would tease because the child has same sex parents...  and those kids are going to tease about anything, not just same sex parents.  I got bullied because of my name, which is a perfectly fine and respectable name, should we ban people from having my name?  Or I got bullied because I didnt want to smoke at school in the bathroom.  Should we make all kids smoke at school in the bathroom??|`|WNWKDw4uaa	Yes.  If you do not agree 100% with the homosexual agenda you are a H8ER and a homophobe.  It is unacceptable to have your own opinion on this issue.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	for god sake there ppl to why cant they adopt children?    it would only help get more children in homes rather than shelters|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Not necessarily. You should get informed on the subject though, if you did I'm sure you wouldn't be against it anymore.|`|yBZlTzWLaa	It's only an "unnatural setting" by your definition of nature. Homosexuality (though not the dominant orientation) is perfectly natural, and can be observed in many non-human animals as well.    A gay couple is just as capable of providing a safe, and nurturing environment as a straight couple. If your concern is that a homosexual family will turn the child gay, then why didn't being raised by heterosexuals make me straight?    You say it's selfish of a gay couple to adopt, but who could be more selfish than the one denying them the joy of raising a child in the only way they can?|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	No. It makes you normal unlike the rest of these pillow biting, carpet munching,  fake penis pumping people in this section.|`|J8iukGsvaa	Ok firstly how does placing a child with a Gay or Lesbian couple mess up a child? what proof do you have of this have you personally gone and studied or done any practical studies with children who have been adopted by homosexuals? or is this based on what you may have read in papers like The Daily Mail or what other people have said.    The think is you cannot base any opinions on things like this unless you have specific evidence that it harms children.    I have no problems with a child being brought up in a loving, stable caring environment, whether that environments between two men, two women or a man and a woman.    Oh and as for "being bullied" my partners daughter of 14 is perceived as cool as she has a gay dad, and has never had any problems with this|`|SNplQjfjaa	no, it makes you sensible.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	Yes, seeing as many credible organizations would disagree with you. You really think a child wouldn't rather have a loving permanent home than be lugged from foster home to foster home their whole lives?    Floridas reason for overturning the gay adoption ban:     In reaching its decision, the court rejected the false assumptions and stereotypes about gay people that the state offered to justify the ban, holding that many reports and studies find that there are no differences in the parenting of homosexuals or the adjustment of their children. These conclusions have been accepted, adopted and ratified by the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatry Association, the American Pediatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Child Welfare League of America and the National Association of Social Workers.    What evidence do you have to the contradict the experts who work for these organizations? Other than your own opinion, which seems to be pretty baseless and irrational.|`|pO8OzblHaa	It doesn't make you a homophobe, but it does make you intolerant and a bigot. If two men want to adopt a child so that they can be happy by having a child to love and care for, how would the child staying in a shelter be better than that? Plus, if you're against gay couples having children, shouldn't you also be against single parents? They aren't a "normal family," either. The only reason the child would be harmed is if people like you taught them that they are being harmed and they think that they are, even though there isn't actually anything wrong with it.|`|E71jweytaa	while i do support gay adoption.     I will tell you in all honesty no it does not. it drives me nuts how people throw around that term like theres no tommorow, it has no meaning, its a useless word|`|W18Pvlvsaa	No, I don't think so.  I see your point of view, I think you're just seeing past the subjective side of things and looking at the truth..  People who think you're homophobic are probably slightly naive  :)|`|lBLBvE0Zaa	Yes, it does. Do you know how many couples of lesbian and bisexual women already have their own families?     The truth is that people who really want to have a child are gonna find a way to do it. It's their right after all. So why have to make them go through more trouble adopting a kid if the result is gonna be the same?    Being homosexual doesn't mean you're gonna abuse your child or you're gonna make them become homosexual as well. You're born being it or not.    Do you really prefer seeing straight parents mistreating their kids or having kids in orphanages than LGTB people using their rights and take care and love them? I'd like to hear your opinion about that.|`|AA11287806	I think you need to take a step back from this issue and look at what you are really saying.    A child can come into a a whole variety of 'home environments' none of which are 'perfect' or free from other people's prejudices and assumptions.  I'm not just talking about homosexuality here, they could be single parents, disabled, rich, poor, religious I could go on.  The most important thing for a child is some sort of stability and love.  With those simple things a child can face anything.  We no longer live in a society where families consist of a 'mummy and daddy' life is complicated and that is the world we live in.  Children need to learn to live with these differences and be understanding of all our differences whatever they might be.    I am a gay dad and have always been in a healthy same sex relationship.  My children have always lived with and loved me as a parent.  Because they only see love and respect at home, they might get the odd bit of abuse, but it is nothing more than any other kid would get.  It also is more a case of instead of them feeling 'ashamed' or 'apologetic' for having gay parents they question why someone would feel the need to abuse them for having parents who love them.      However I would like to thank you for being honest with your feelings, for it is through honesty and a willingness to see life from others perspectives, that we can all learn and better understand the world we live in.|`|N3dqnNr6aa	yes. yes it does.|`|06Z3fh4laa	A phobia is to fear something. Do you fear gay people? Does gay men having babies scare you?|`|lvF5Tpniaa	Did you know that,in the US, about 1,000 children per year are murdered by thier parents? We gay people don't do that. You might want to rethink your position.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Blanket statements against any group of people leaves no one an out, therefore you have closed the door on the issue and that is what make you a bit homophobic.    Now had you of said that you think in most cases the idea of gay adoptition by two men should at the very least be scrutinized because not all gay men would make a good parent then you're off the hook.|`|BD8O7RR3aa	Yes, I do think that make you homophobic and selfish also.  I think bringing a child into a loving family, no matter what type of family it is, is the most unselfish thing that can be done!  There are so many things that could "mess up" a child - divorce, for example.  Does that mean people should stay together and be miserable for the sake of raising their child in a "normal" family?  Absolutely not.     There are so many children in the world that only want loving parents/a parent, clothes on their bodies and a roof over their head and I do not think that we should discriminate against anyone who is willing to give those things to a child  (gay, straight, yellow, purple, woman, man, etc).      I think you are extremely selfish to want to keep children on the streets, instead of sending them to a family (NO matter what type of family) who will love them, care for them, and raise them well.|`|4VM7EEwdaa	"Unnatural setting. im all for gay marriage,"    THE INTERNET ITSELF IS UNNATURAL.  HAVING TWO DADDIES WON'T MAKE IT WORSE, GIRLIE.|`|kVcy1VRyaa	No, it doesn't.  I'm not entirely sure where I stand on the issue.   On one hand, it would be nice to see as many children in safe and secure homes as possible.  On the other, children already bully one another over things like eye colour; so having homosexual guardians is going to be something that a child will definitely get harshly picked on for.|`|bAbZMg0oaa	it might be hard on the child, especially if they were adopted when they were about 5-6-7 and had friends, or if they grew up calling 2 guys 'daddy', then when the teacher asked about thier mum, they would say that they had 2 dads and would be a social outcast for ever. but i don't think its homophobic to be against gay men adopting. but what about lesbians?|`|zLYpJj7Iaa	No, you aren't homophobic. From what you've written, you don't seem that kind of person. Moreover, i can tell that i agree with you. They can be happy on their own, but the child whom they would adopt could grow up severely confused. he may be already confused about not growing up with his natural parents. in my opinion, he don't need other difficulties in his childhood.   Sorry for my terrible english, i'm just trying to learn it well.|`|mdH4EGPEaa	No I don't think so. I think children need a mother and a father figure in their lives and unfortunately, the reality is that often kids with gay parents are bullied alot (I've seen it happen alot). And for the record I am gay|`|W4xJGKk2aa	as long as they are capable and responsible enough to care for a child, I dont see why not. it sure sound homophobic too me.but then again, you dont even know if you are homophobic, therwise you wouldnt have asked this|`|4Te5gVvDaa	All it suggest is that you believe it is better that a child endures the hardships of a foster institution, endure likely abuse, adopt sadistic characteristics and never know what it truly means to know what a family is rather than have a family that happens to have gay parents.|`|0010f6549f4b1c474dcb8e34524fff6baa	You said it dose not make you a homophobic. However, your asking if it dose. So there is a slight chance in your minds power that you are.     My Psych class professor said "You have people that are stupid and people that are ignorant. Ignorance can be fixed, stupid is forever."     On this I would have to say that you are just ignorant on the fact that gay men can make great fathers!  You could also ask  dose a bipolar woman have the right to keep her children if their father dies?  YES! that would be a stupid thought too. Even tho she might have a chemical imbalance she can still give the children love, a home, food, and stimulation. So can a gay man.  I would tell you that you need to read  if you have not heard of it Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.|`|xuuaMTmtaa	So, a family that is struggling just to live in poverty, where the dad has no job, sits around drinking all day, and gets his wife pregnant every 9 months, so that they now have 10 kids, whom the government and taxpaying citizens have to support, and the mom probably has at least 3 different daddies to those kids, make better parents than a gay couple?    Because I see FAR more of THIS than I see a child being raised in a loving, financially secure home with two gay parents.|`|V8lvVvoiaa	Well im gay & i dont think ure homophobic its just your opinion, but it can also depend on where you live, I live in A place called Hebden Bridge N its the lesbian capital of the UK N most the kids here have two mums, and no one gets picked on because its a normal thing here so it does depend on where you live and wat the peoples opinions are about it!!|`|2242ab75cc3bad9ab4ca7fbaf5578defaa	No not at all    You don't have a phobia of gays do you?|`|lwXEK969aa	No, you just know what would be best for a child. Lets not forget a phobia is a fear of something........ its not like you run away like a little girl if you see a gay. So you are clearly not a homophobe.    All of these idiots who are calling you a homophobic and showing hatred towards homophabics are just as bad as the people who hate gays. I will echo my point, a phobia is a fear of something, it would be wrong for a person to show hatred towards somebody who suffers fron chlostrophobia or arachnaphobia so why does it make it ok for people to show hatred towards people who suffer from homophobia? it is not ok. But you are no homophobic, you know the taunting and the trauma that the child will go through is wrong, it is not gay peoples fault they will get treated like this, but that is just the way it is.    To OLD GAY GUY below me: i am sorry but i am going to have to call you a COMPLETE IDIOT, the only reason why no gay couples kill thier children is because it is impossible for two gay people to have a baby they do not want, they have to go out of thier way to get a baby so they are not going to do that if they hate children and want rid of them are they? If gays could naturally have kids by accident and so on then the statistics would be the same fors gay and straight people alike, what you are basically saying is that a persons sexuality determines if they are a nice person or not, we both know that is a load of ****.|`|5b478a242969ee67691fa226064cfcd6aa	I don't think it's homophobic, you are entitled to an opinion. I can see where you are coming from on this though. Children are (unintentionally) cruel to each other and tease each other about the slightest thing. What starts as a joke from one child to another can easily escalate into full scale bullying. Also, parental attitudes are passed down to children and these also escalate.    In the case of these children though, Mum was a drug addict who wasn't really in a fit state to care for these kids and her parents were both really ill and weren't in a fit state to care for them either. I have to say I think it's a bit rich of Mum to say she wants the kids in a normal family when she is their mother and she was more interested in her drugs than providing this for them.    I wish them all the luck in the world, they're going to need it.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	ANY family arrangement has the potential to **** a child up. I know a boy whose mother used to scream at him that he was a curse, and the worst thing that had ever happened to her.    He is now in jail for murder, and suffers from mental illness.    The only thing that matters is that WHOEVER is raising the child does so with love, and kindness. As long as a parent, regardless of gender, does everything they can to be there for the child, and see that they are loved and educated, then that child has the best possible home environment.    It's not homophobic of you to not want to be adopted by gay parents, or to not want them to adopt - but it IS shortsighted. Gay people can do just as good a job of raising children as straight people.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	no...you're just ignorant, and your views are a damage to society.  mixed race kids get made fun of - should biracial parents not be allowed to have kids?  ugly/fat kids get made fun of - does that mean we should force them all to get plastic surgery?  everyone gets made fun of for something.  and the kid doesn't have to tell anyone in school who his parents are, if he's honestly that worried.  studies show that gay couples raise well rounded kids.  look it up.    "it's hard enough being adopted as it is" ....well it's even harder NOT being adopted and being homeless/in foster care your whole life.|`|VvPQKqOuaa	You are not very open minded. Straight people **** up their kids too! I don't think making mistakes as a parent has anything to do with the parents sexuality. As parents, gay or straight, the only thing we can do is love them unconditionally and guide them to be kind, considerate, loving, OPEN MINDED, citizens, that do all they can to better their lives and the lives of other individuals. Straight people do not hold the answers to being better parents.   I am a single gay man and a proud dad to a 23 year old daughter that is a fine person. She is also pretty successful in her young life. She already owns her own business and a home. She is kind, caring and loving of all people no matter what race, religion or sexual orientation. A very well adjusted human being. What else can a parent ask for???|`|PeQ40WcWaa	I see your point and I don't think it's makes you completely homophobic.    However - homophobia stems from the belief that homosexuality is abnormal or unnatural. You yourself said that you believe a homosexual couple would bring a child into an unnatural setting.    Therefore, it does insinuate that you are not COMPLETELY educated about homosexuality.    In my opinion, homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. It does not matter about procreation. Procreation is just that. Man and woman were designed to make babies together. They were not necessarily designed to love one another, feel attracted to one another, or raise children together. They were not necessarily intended to get married or stay in monogamous relationships.     I believe that if a child is loved and cared for, they will have a good life regardless of the sexuality of their parents. It may be irresponsible of a gay couple to have a child if they live in a community where homophobia is rife. But let's say, for argument's sake, a gay couple brought a child up in LA, San Fran, etc, then the child is likely to be accepted just like any other child.    I don't think that you are showing any hatred towards gay people with your statement - but I do believe that at the heart of it, you see homosexuality as unnatural, and that is where homophobia stems from.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Sorry, but yes, it does.    It doesn't matter what gender or sexual orientation adoptive parents have, if all they want to do is provide a safe and loving home for a child, and if they can do this.     If you're talking about the importance of role models, plenty of gay men have female friends, and plenty of gay women have male friends. In many places the gay community is just that, a community, and in less developed and possibly happier societies, children are reared by communities, not half-reared by nuclear families.     So what is your problem? The nuclear family that doesn't fit the blueprint? The nuclear family doesn't work regardless of the gender of the parents!|`|PvJdZcZTaa	Slightly, moreover you're stubbornly biased.     The idea that gay couples shouldn't be allowed to adopt children is absurd. No matter what argument is made against a gay couple adopting that same argument goes into interracial, single, low income, and elderly couples being allowed to adopt. I don't see a difference.     As for you wanting to debate on shouldn't the child's best interest and physiological health, what makes you think a gay couple would be any different from any other parent(s)? Society is a lot more accepting then you're accepting to realize. And towards reaching the goal of all genders, ethnicity's, races, orientations, etc etc to be EQUAL; have gay couples adopting will make a huge change in our society because of the fact that that generation would be more accepting and understanding then any others. I have personally met MANY kids from the ages of 5 to 20 who were raised by gay couples who were just like any other kid. Only one of those kids that I met were bisexual.

Take it from me im Cuban (:    Anything else im here --|`|G3T0VSldaa	The first one  The numbers in spanish from 16-99 use   "and" to say them  16-29 combine the word "Y" (and) and the second number into one word, but change it to an "I"  For example "19" is diecinueve  Literally "ten and nine"  Another example-39 is "treinta y nueve"-these words are separated  literally "30 and 9"    When using a "...  and one" before a masculine noun or as a number in general, instead of saying veintiuno, it can be changed to veintin.  or 41 cuarenta y un. In the 20-29 range there are accents on veintids, veintitrs, and veintisis.  Also there is an accent on diecisis.  Twenty-one also has an accent on the "u" in the "un" part.|`|NvcjE845aa	setecientos veintiuno  setecientos veintin  setecientos veinte y  uno|`|FEGtnUEcaa	setecientos veintiuno    "veintiuno" has no accent and it is spelled as one word.    You can also say "veintin", if that word is an adjective:    setecientos veintin personas    but    el nmero setecientos veintiuno.|`|2uX4cMGIaa	Lo dices asi ( you say it like this): Setecientos Veintiuno,  Hope it helps!!!!|`|QMAqzpKEaa	Neither are right . Sorry :-( Let me explain why:    Setecientos is 700 so you are correct there :-)  Veinte is 20  Normally we would add "y" meaning "and" for numbers 31-39  For example 31 would be treinta y uno  21-29 is like this though:    21-veintiuno  22 - veintidos  23- ventitres   24- veinticuatro  25- veinticinco  26- veintiseis  27- veintisiete  28 - veintiocho  29- veintinueve    You see that an "i" replaces the "y"  or  "and"? This is because the word "veinte" for the English word "twenty" ends in the vowel "e". It is the only one in the "tens" in the Spanish numbers that does! The letter "e", if followed by "y" means the "y" has to change into an "i". It's the rule!    30-39 and the rest of the numbers follow the same pattern, so it's 21-29 you have to watch out for. 31-39 is like this:    31 - treinta y uno  32 - treinta y dos  33- treinta y tres    and so on...    41- cuarenta y uno  42- cuarenta y dos    This pattern carries on until 100  So, just watch out for and learn the pattern for 21-29! :-)|`|OTGOF9XXaa	the second one|`|nxeffjjKaa	the second one|`|HAVqiBxzaa	setecientos veintiuno|`|mMGDavCDaa	second one|`|KkOzs2Czaa	setecientos veinte y uno is what i learned.|`|E0wgZ4K0aa	setecientos veinte y uno.

RlauWAg6aa	I am 27 and I don't find girls in their teens sexually attractive AT ALL.    I prefer women who are my equal - morally, ethically, sexually.  A teenage girl is not even an adult so thus there is no sexual attraction there at all.    And the fatther ted dude has it spot on.  I would think it can get very dark if someone finds themselves lusting strongly over very young girls.  However, you know, we all have thoughts and urges we might not be proud of - perfectly normal; it's when they are acted upon that there is a problem.|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	It is an abuse to exert control and influence over another person who is so much younger as to be vulnerable to such controls and influence.    Being attracted to another sexually does not remove the responsibility to be a decent, ethical and moral human being.  Nor does it give anyone the right to abuse others for personal benefit regardless of the harm caused to that other person.    To be human, is to be responsible because we have intelligence, we have sensitivity and we have judgement.  To use and abuse members of our own species is perhaps the most evil of aberrations that we are capable of.    I don't care what thumbs are thrown at me... our sexuality must be rooted in our greatest achievement... love.    The abuse of those weaker and more vulnerable than us is nothing whatsoever to do with love.  The criminalisation of an abuse such as this is our second greatest achievement.|`|StRaKUf6aa	Because it's illegal to make advances on them, and that's usually what men do when they find people attractive.|`|TMi1GhSHaa	if your talking about teens that already hit puberty and are 16 and up AND your in your 20's thats fine, I dated a 24 year old before I was 16 at the time.|`|YpxGfmdKaa	Haha! Might as well tell a bit of a story here !  When I was in a pub in Spain there was this old guy sitting behind me really drunk (bare in mind I couldnt move seats cos there was no other seats empty) and he kept touching my hair and my mom was gone to get a drink or something and when she came back he said ''shes so young'' (I was 17 at the time) and ''shes so shy'' , obviously I wasnt gonna talk to him when I was left on my own with him for them few minutes!! But after reading your question I realised he probably liked the fact I was young =[ lol  P.S. I didnt think they found us sexually attractive.. although I always find that theres at least one old freaky guy looking at my a** when I shop in Lidl =/|`|VpR6qvb5aa	It's basic biology. When females reach their reproductive years, they are attractive to men. It's survival of the species.|`|z6Eqgzpyaa	because they are young as you have said and we should know as men when to draw a line to whom we find sexually attractive|`|3r252UIRaa	They are to me, but that's normal because I'm 16.

375432572adde7e904658c0aa0e5a4b2aa	That doesn't mean they can build a better car.  It is very expensive to ship cars to the islands, and that is why there are old ones there.    Maybe they just have good mechanics, or maybe the cars aren't in very good shape either.|`|wV21OIMtaa	No, but the cigars are awesome.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	I don't think you realize you have a good thing until you lose them. maybe we will have to go cuba and buy one of those old american cars.|`|UOO2pnJDaa	They don't build cars. They took old American cars and made them last. They made an American car better. In the states the Americans invest thousands upon thousands of dollars to restore an old car. In Cuba, the same car can be restored and maintained for pennies on the dollar.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	We know full well how to build a better car that last. The American car manufacturer believed that if they built the best car that they knew how to build the auto industry would not expand and become the industry that they hoped for it to be. If a car lasted for five hundred thousand miles instead of eighty thousand miles a family would buy a new car only every ten or fifteen years so they built one to last about three years for the average family. They did not understand that other countries would steal the car market away by building a car that was cheaper than the American models and run three or four times as long. They hoped that import tariffs would keep foreign automobiles off of the American market.  The did not consider the goods that we shipped to them would have tariffs applied to American manufactured goods. Cubans can't show us how to do anything except roll wonderful cigars that we now know are detrimental to our health.

b371fd5225e0f0948944cb7d323618b7aa	ok feel free to emil me after i post this info here:    realize that i am possibly very similar to you. i still have issues when it comes to making "friends", but i can socialize very well. when i was in HS i did not really talk to anyone but i do not think it had anything to do with sexuality.    i never really socialized well even though i had friends as a kid. the friends i had were the ones that always had to initiate the social interaction... like the neighborhood kids would come banging on my door to get me outside. i am just not very socially aggressive. is this like you?    basically in high school i had a hard time finding a seat in the cafeteria because of the social anxiety. the one place i felt comfortable sitting was a full table and i would end up sitting on the end of the table which was technically against the rules but i think the teachers felt bad for me because they knew i was a little nerd that couldn't fit in :P the thing is... now that i think back to it, the act of sitting on the end of the table just made me stick out even more and sort of confirmed the thing i was afraid of in the first place. i was afraid i would not fit in but i only confirmed it by placing myself in the one place that stood out the most in the cafeteria. you are doing the same thing. you are afraid you don't fit in so you run and hide thereby proving it. you create a self fulfilling prophecy.    see - the more you do this sort of thing, the more you feel out of place and the more you drive yourself to do it more.    this is a bit hard because HS students are bastards... but you need to scope out the cafeteria and check for the open seats. now it is likely you have something in common with at least 1 person at a table with an open seat. wherever you see the biggest connection, just go and talk to the 1 person you know knows who you are. "is anybody sitting here?" this is the thing you fear most. you fear that they will lie and say yes the seat is taken just to be a prick and make you look stupid... but guess what... in this case, you are not in the wrong. it is him, he is the idiot he is the one that should feel ashamed. granted he probably will not but that does not mean that you need to be ashamed and embarrassed in his place!    this is where you need your own sense of self worth. i realized this when i lived in an apartment with my brother as my roommate. he is my exact opposite and would have friends over every night. basically i had become depressed for various reasons and i was thinking why would any of these cool kids, why would any of these socialites care the slightest bit about me? i am a weirdo in some senses and i fully admit it. why would they even talk to me? they had a slight clue who i was from school. i was the older brother of their friend.    they would hang out at our apartment and i would be there. then i would do one of my strange things and they would all look at each other like wtf? i tend to have a quick sense of humor - especially from the perspective of a bunch of drunk kids. so i would surprise them with something. eventually they were always trying to coax me into their conversations because they wanted to hear my responses. at the time i was sort of indifferent and i didn't care about anything (nature of depression) so i would "play along" and just say what was on my mind because i was not in the mood to be embarrassed and didn't care if i was.    after a while i started to realize that the embarrassment was all in my head. i started to realize that these people actually liked having me in the room. they started to beg me to go over someone else's house on a certain night to watch Soppranos because he was the only one that had HBO. i was like "no no no" but they insisted and i started going.    everyone wasn't out to get me like i had this impression of in my mind. all of this had nothing to do with my sexuality because no one suspected the slightest bit and my lack of a relationship was a result of me being so socially inept, not the other way around. i still do not really know how to advance to a relationship but i now am completely open to talking to people.    your value of self worth is that you are a human just like everyone else and equal in the society. those that treat you poorly for no reason diminish their own character, not yours. if at this point in my life someone began blasting me for anything out of my control, the response is simple. "does it make you a better person when you try putting me down?"    look - when you find a place to sit, you can choose to sit in another place the next day, and the next, etc... if you do not want to start talking to people and there is an empty table, just go sit there. you are worried that people will notice how uncomfortable you are to be sitting alone. drop the worry. take out your homework and start working on a problem. if people want to make fun of you or point and laugh, think about what they are laughing at. what are you doing|`|NQ3eETlYaa	True friends will come to you.|`|K6cHlzAkaa	just start joining in on conversations that interest you in class. just start by talking. it will take time but things will improve. Work on your self-confidence. see if the friends you do have will let you sit with them at lunch, then you can also get to know their friends at the table as well.|`|FtoSIA0aaa	*Sigh. Alright...     First off, you don't need to stress so much about this. Sometimes being alone is a good thing once in a while, but it seems to me that you have to much "lonely" time. To help with the uber shy feeling, just take deep breathes and say what you want. If people comment on it, no problem, they're just one or two people.     Second, you don't have to avoid people all the time, sometimes just saying "hey" to a stranger will make them you're best friend. [Trust me thats where I met my best friend. 1st grade; 15 years of friendship :D.] Just let go of you anxiety and ask someone who you think will say "yes" and go have a good time.     Last, are you out at school? If you are [congratulations], if not, then I can see you're dilemma. Well, all I can say to add is be yourself, say what you want to say, and walk around like you're deaf. That's what I do, and the zoning out really helps.     Happy Tuesday. :3|`|fFmbBRbcaa	try joining a support group such as gsa im at the same point as you and I'm 18 sadly i wasn't out until just recently but i am going to going gsa so i know the friends that i make will be supportive and not homophobic my sexuality was one of my biggest social issues and i want to change that!!! good luck dude =D|`|gDpDHcAvaa	I know how this feels a bit since i too am gay, 15 and in the beginning of my high school career. I though found a nitch that I fit in well, I do Theatre at my school and I have a blast.

PnMtlZ0Yaa	Love is blind, but alas, I am not...    I would scoop her up for the miracle to science she is. Doctors would pay a fortune to examine her if she had the eyebrows of superman that somehow are impervious to plucking, waxing or other attempts at correcting. Equally for her buck teeth that can't be fixed- Is she like  beaver, where they just keep growing unless she knaws on things to wear them away?

They have all of eternity to consider how they thought that they were good enough to stand before the Holy God of Heaven and so they rejected his dear son Jesus who laid down his sinless life so that no one would have to go to Hell.|`|7cjn2u9uaa	Gabe is a better poker player so if he doesn't already have bragging rights he will win them eventually.|`|f4422f216561e6952afc8a35de25e36baa	None of them.

Saying his country would send food to Germany so the pretty fraulines wouldn't starve to death. What a cruel bastard.    He made Churchill & Truman lick his boots even though we had the bomb. Then in just 4 years he evened the scale! he even got an ICBM in service before us! He turned a poverty-stricken peasant nation into a superpower in just a few short years!

Ito7XubOaa	Because she is a single mother who already had 6 children she could not financially take care of.    I recently heard that she is now offering her story for 2 million dollars and is asking to go onto talk shows... she also plans on writing a book on parenting.     I think it was extremely irresponsible on her part and now simply because she has 14 kids she plans on making money.    Because this is america and we are stupid, her little scheme will work. I bet she'll have enough money to  hire a few nannies to do her job as well...|`|4XaKOXC8aa	because she already had 6 children before the octuplets, she went about getting pregnant in an irresponsible way, and she clearly doesn't have the means to support 14 children. (i don't know who the father is, she lives with her mother in a teeny house, she's bankrupt, and her father has to return to Iraq to make a living). even the woman's mother, who she lives with, says shes OBSESSED with having children. it just seems like an unhealthy situation.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	because they used a lot of controversial contraception techniques to have 8 kids...and they already had 6    who needs to have so many kids anyway?  I highly doubt they'll be able to support 8 of them through college, and now those 6 older kids are going to be completely neglected.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	I don't know the woman, so I can't judge her character.  But it's been reported that she had 6 children already, making 14 total now all concieved through in vitro.  She's not married and I've heard nothing about her having a partner to help her carry the load.  And she lives in a modest single family house with her parents.  Many people are questioning if there is a adequate economic and social support system in place for all those children to be raised in a healthy environment.  I think that's a reasonable concern.  Social workers should go in and see how that family is living.|`|CoiOMTiBaa	Lot's of reasons:    -she can't take care of them   -she can-t provide them with a stable home  -there are ethical issues regarding IVF   -she's recently said that she did it because she wanted to have a tv show about how to raise kids or something, which essentially means that she did it so that she can experiment on the kids  -she's not looking out for the welfare of the children, at all given as she, as a single unemployed mother cannot afford to take care of them   -even her MOTHER said that she was making poor decisions and already couldn't take care of the children she had  -there is a lot of concern that the reason she did this is so that she could make money, which is highly unethical  - and many other reasons    This is a clear example of a very poor choice as well as being selfish.|`|fhGhZ7cIaa	It is because she acted irresponsibly in bringing more children to this world when she already was struggling to care for 6 others.    The point is not that she's having too many kids - vitro is usually like that where they implant embryos in hopes that one survives - and that's fine.    The problem is that she has no job, declared bankrupcy, lives at home with 6 children, one with autism. What business does she have even considering ONE MORE child when she has a hard time with the other six? It was irresponsible, whether it be one or eight children.  Then there's t he issue of exploitation; she's already looking for book/TV deals. This to me is grounds for child endangerment.|`|0aa3dcce6d820b8604d8f72bbb1de485aa	well i think people are sick of seeing women take pills to try and get pregnant, because its bad for the health of the babies.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	I don't dislike her-I just don't have any respect for her.I mean,she already had 6 children,and why does she need another 8? And all the articles didn't mention that she had a job or husband...Are these 14 kids going to be supported by welfare and our tax dollars,while she lays on her back and does her thing? And what kind of care can she possibly give 14 children,hmm?? Does this woman plan on having more?  What about the people that can't have children?|`|VUNfI7yBaa	I am just wondering why in the world would a single mother that already has 6 kids at home get fertility treatment and have another 8 kids?

eBKJRmEgaa	Those lines don't say anything specifically Christian, 'Father' could be used in any monotheistic religion, but it could be interpreted as such.|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Seems that way to me, and I have seen the video played in a church service.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Yes, so?|`|FfxmE9Toaa	It's a mish-mash of a hit by Roberta Flack/Donnie Hathaway from the 1970s.

I suppose you could say it's Christian, but is Fergie's "My Humps"?|`|hcu9wBFmaa	Yeah|`|EfBMzCjaaa	yes it is i like that song altho i havent heard it in a while|`|KXQVRQdjaa	The first two lines are not complimentary to Christians.  They are a slam on some Christians' hypocrisy.  Father father and above are not necessarily Christian.  Do you know how many religions there are in the world and how many of them refer to some kind of father in the sky?    The song is about compassion, love, and peace.  Don't believe that Christianity has a monopoly on those things.  I feel it speaks of Pagan values, as well as Hindu, Buddhist, Unitarian Universalist, Secular Humanist, etc.  If someone divides the world into "Christian" and "bad" one is living completely against the song.    But Yeshua of Nazareth would have liked the song.
Imqb5ueqaa	Directly. With the people who have been told, and with the person spreading the lie.     I will demand a retraction and sue for slander if the damage is not repaired.|`|AA12152549	You can just make it known that you do not engage in gossip and that you don't want to hear it.|`|ZjpVlm9Gaa	I confront who ever said it. Or if that's not possible, whoever I heard it from. Ignoring is difficult for me.|`|3MKjuJ4raa	Be direct with people who are gossiping about you or others. Tell them that what they're doing is hurtful and that you refuse to participate in such discussions.     Change the subject. If your boss, a coworker or a close friend is gossiping and you feel uncomfortable asking them to stop, change the subject so that you don't have to participate in gossip that may end up hurting someone else's feelings.     Prevent gossip by paying attention to what you do and say around others, especially around those who tend to gossip. While it may not be fun to censor yourself, at least you won't be providing any new material for people to spread rumors about.     Tell your secrets only to trusted friends to be sure that no one is spreading your business around town.     Let it go. If you've already asked the gossipers to stop blabbing about you or others and they're still at it, move on and let it go. The gossipers will eventually get bored and move on, and you'll be happy that you didn't spend any more of your time worrying about what they had to say.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	If I hear someone gossiping, I sort of move in and go, "well, if you think that's amazing, did you hear about the guy/girl [whatever gender the gossiper is] who went around telling lies about other folks and ended up fired?"  Or some other thing along those lines, as if you are starting a new delicious rumor.  If the gossip is about me, I listen and grin and start laughing loudly, say something about "gee, I wasn't sure that rumor I started ever got off the ground but I guess it did!  I'll have to start a new one now and see how long it'll take to get around."

kX3Kn7Cjaa	In my experience most people have holes in their general knowledge.     Yes, they can be smarter than most, and still don't know "basic things" because it somehow never was brought to their attention. And because they don't know that they don't know this fact, how would they know that most other people consider this "basic"?    The more you learn to know, the more you learn to realise how much you don't know. "The wisest are wise because they know they are fools", someone once said and I believe this to be true.     It also depends on how you define "basic", as this is a highly cultural thing. What is basic trivia in one country may not allways be common knowledge in another ie.     It also depends on how you define "smart". Scoring high on an IQ test doesn't necessarily mean that you follow the news or know what a photosynthesis is. Likewise, being knowledgable doesn't necessarily mean you score high on an IQ test.|`|AA12152549	Yes, that is so.  Smart people cannot possible know everything about everything .. even the basics.  My partner holds a doctorate and was Phi Beta Kappa in college.  He's really smart about a lot of stuff, but he's really a putz when it comes to things like changing a tire.  That's the way life is.  Even Einstein didn't know everything.|`|913fb8ceffd6a8e7aea30ec81720fd2eaa	Absolutely.  Einstein could unlock secrets of the universe, but had to have his wife's help on his income taxes.    A person can be "book smart" without being "people smart", and vice versa.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I think the biggest problem 'smart peoples' have is thinking they are smart.    Forget about knowing basic things, most don't even know themselves.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Yes-my husband is exceptionally smart,though he acts like a moron!|`|BACWcjt0aa	People can be so smart they don't know the basic or are crazy.|`|FnAB2SJ0aa	they might be book smart, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are street smart too!|`|l43NSgHyaa	There is a saying that people who are very smart (or even children or teens that are advanced for their age) do not know much common sense.   They're the people who can solve a difficult math problem in 2 seconds, but trip over their own feet while walking or can't seem to operate a car.|`|AA11312653	I am laughing out loud. I work with some amazing intelligent scientists in a research institute, people who are world famous in their field. Among the questions I've handled from these highly intelligent men and women with are:  How do I get rid of eMail that I've already read and don't want anymore?  Why can't I get adjust the ring volume on my cell phone? (It was turned off.)  The treatment lasts six hours. Do you think the subjects will need a restroom break?  I left my lights on and now my car won't start. Do I need a tow truck?  And none of them can figure out how to change the message on their voice mail or program the microwave. Thank goodness that while most of us are good at least a few things, even the smartest of us can't be good at everything. If these people were as good at everything as they were at their job, then there would be no job for ME.

k5izERYnaa	I'm pretty sure it's not, and I wouldn't assume it was if I saw someone wearing it. I've heard of someone that got sent home for wearing it to school because the school thought it was racist, but she did research and she was sure that it wasn't. I'm sorry I can't give you a more detailed answer - why don't you send the company an email and ask them just to make sure?        Also, if you're not white, nobody will likely notice if you're wearing something that could possibly be considered "white supremacist apparel" anyway (even though I doubt that company is). Unless it was something obvious like a swastika, and in that case they'd just think it was a joke. :P

It is not the same with when you are wearing a watch.    Wristband first came out for the heart disease awareness participation.  It started among the "gym-rats"  At the time the wristband wearers were considered as heart disease awareness participation etc. in other words they are "healthy" people or at least trying to be healthy.  Usually those people are supposed to be pretty active in life and sport.    So at that time, the society was "divided" between active and non-active people.  As you might know mostly guys are the ones who really want to be in the "active" group.  As a guy, you have to know sport, you have to know supper bowl etc.  It is our society which teaches so.  So mostly more guys than girls wear the wristband.    And now the color and meaning of the wristband have been slipped away from the original as usual.    So is it cool or not?  Well, if you want to wear it just wear it.  If you think you look cool wearing it, you are cool.  If you don't like it, don't wear it.    But I am sure in the bottom of your heart, you wear it because you want other people say: it's cool, sexy, active etc.  otherwise you won't wear it.    Peace|`|gw88BKXyaa	i wear one and im a guy i think its ok?

ahFV9rfxaa	Many years ago I was fishing with about five friends at night for catfish on the Rocky River in North Carolina and some animal was making a loud screeching noise.  None of us could actually see it.  We had a camp fire next to the water.  Whatever this was it was crossing the river back and forth in a circle around us.  The river isn't very wide, but the water is swift and it's Rocky.      When we finally decided to leave we had to climb a steep high embankment, and I ended up last up the hill, and I was carrying the stringer of fish.  Whatever it was it came within ten feet of me and was vigorously shaking the small trees near where I was.  At that time I was at a chest high rock that I needed to climb over, but I just stood there for a bit while it shook the trees while making it's loud noise because I was too scared to  turn my back on it to climb up and over that rock.    There had been reports in the news around that time of several big foot sightings, and the local press had nick named it "Knobby."  We had driven to Cabaras County where the sightings had occurred to go fishing.  I think it might have wanted the fish I was carrying, and I really wish I had pulled one off the stringer and threw it toward it.    It was making that loud screeching noise very near us as we were leaving.  The reason I ended up last was because we were fighting our way up the hill against each other and I ended up getting pulled backwards as we were all in a mad rush to leave.  I was ahead of most of them but when I first tried to climb over the rock others were climbing over me and using me for leverage and I ended up getting pulled off of the rock.    I never actually saw it, but I think we encountered whatever was being reported in the media.  In later years I heard recordings on TV believed to be by a big foot, and the sound was very similar to what I heard, a high pitched sound.    So, yes, it was what could be termed a mythical creature in my neighborhood.|`|90MwwrSeaa	Read "The Beast of Bray Road" and "Hunting the American Werewolf" for detailed information on these dogmen creatures. Here is a site run by the author of these two books (Linda Godfrey, who appeared in the Monsterquest werewolf episode):  http://www.beastofbrayroad.com/mainlair....    The episode about the Ohio Grassman was centered in Salt Fork State Park which is just down the road from where I grew up. In fact my brother worked with two park rangers who had encounters with Bigfoot in the park. However, the name "Grassman" has never been used by the residents of that area. The History Channel "borrowed" the name from another part of Ohio.    Scroll down to "Spring 1972" to read about one of the sightings I mentioned above:  http://www.angelfire.com/oh/ohiobigfoot/...|`|1qRMHAjQaa	That must be creepy, no i live in boring kentucky
cMa5DNhYaa	well at first i was just like you i dint want to tell anyone and was kind of embarrassed/ashamed of being gay, but after i finally did come out it was so much better. It is like a huge relief off your shoulders and you fell kinda dumb for worrying about all the bad things you had pictured in your mind.|`|dJs8GN3Qaa	Depending on who you tell, it might cause problems.    I told my two best friends and they're completely fine with it.    Everyone reacts a diferent way, the dude I told was like "OMG" and the girl was like "Oh, that's okay, I still love you :D"    Not telling people is fine, I just didn't want to keep that secret away from those two friends.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	i didnt read all that.  but telling people is a good thing. it helps you accept yourself.|`|K6cHlzAkaa	I had planned to keep mum about my orientation, but eventually got sick and tired of being something I was not. It got to the point of thinking "eh kiss my --- if you dont like it". Thats how frustrated and irrtated I got from hiding all the time. I didnt go paint the town red proclaiming who I was, I just eventually didnt deny it if the ? came up. If someone didnt like it; that person was not my friend.|`|x7uRjwseaa	How would you have been lying to your ex-gf if you are bi? Bisexuals are attracted to both sexes. And you don't have to tell people about your sexuality if you don't feel it is important. But if you're not concerned with that then why would you ask this question in the first place?|`|S785iGozaa	yea some of my family members,cousins.(my mom knows though)  It's really none of their business in all honesty. I'm not trying to hide anything from them but my sexuality and emotional attractions are my business and it's just the same for them. If we all happen to be speaking about our personal relationships then they'll just find out then.|`|FtoSIA0aaa	Well I'll give you two scenarios. You pick one...    1. Bisexual boy remains silent about his true sexuality, and is happy with it. With no one knowing, he begins feeling lonely that he can't openly be in a relationship with a guy. He thinks that his choice wasn't the best choice and he begins to feel very depressed. His family thinks you have a disorder and takes you to a doctor. You lives a lonely life..     NOW    2. Bisexual boy speaks out about his true self and everyone within ear-shot supports him with open arms and loves him dearly. He magically bumps into the guy / girl of his dreams at the local coffee shop a few years later. He or she and him fall madly in love with each other and move in with each other. He lives happily.     Hopefully you pick scenario dos. :||`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	ya I'm the same way, I dont have the balls to come out, I just can't imagine what it would be like in my small homophic town!|`|HP0a2HeZaa	Most of my family knows I am Bi. I also have many friends I have told and they dont look at me any different. Being open is a good thing, and if I were you I would tell somebody. The one thing I hate is people are ashamed of being Bi/gay. It's somethin you should at least try to be open with a few friends or family.

lfnjwpu1aa	According to Wikipedia  "Pyrokinesis, derived from the Greek words  (p?r, meaning "fire, lightning") and ?? (knesis, meaning "motion"), was the name, coined by horror novelist Stephen King for the ability to create or to control fire with the mind that he gave to the protagonist Charlie McGee in Fire-starter". ...

However, he mentions Hawaii, which throws me off. "Aghaid" has too many consonants to be a Hawaiian word, so maybe it's a Native American language spoken along the west coast (like California) that some Hawaiians speak?    No idea!|`|FCEw1jP9aa	It sounds Irish.

PlmT4lHXaa	Don't be nervous!!! It'll be fun :)    To solve the guy problem: Ask your girlfriends to invite some of their guy friends. Problem solved!    People WILL dance if you play the right music..(i.e. rap, hip hop) also, the bigger the crowd, the more people will dance. It's hard to start dancing in a small group because the people won't want everyone to stare at them.    Have some plans prepared in case things get boring. Borrow Guitar Hero or some Wii game from a friend (if you don't have one) everyone loves interactive video games. Maybe some more adult-like board games like Taboo or Scattagories.    Alcohal helps, but if you are 16 I guess that's not an option.    If worst comes to worst, it will be a little bit boring... (which it probably won't).. but its better than having no party at all.
05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	They have taken maybe a dozen out of the 160,000 people who have been PCVs. They all helped on the family farm from the time they could walk and had stellar leadership records in 4H/FFA.    Developing countries don't need high school graduates. They have plenty of their own. You'd just be taking a job from a local citizen. What they need are college graduates willing to work in an upriver school or a back country clinic. Local college graduates, just like ours, tend to want to work in big cities, where there is something to do at night, a large pool of single people, major league sports, symphony and shopping, etc. etc.    It sounds harsh, but good intentions are not enough. In one sense the Peace Corps is like an employment service, in that they match people with skills who want to volunteer with requests from developing countries for people with those skills. Developing countries want college graduates, for the most part.    Hang on to those dreams, finish college, then join the Peace Corps and change the world. I did. We don't change much of it, and we don't change it much, but we change the world.

It isn't all about my experiences. I search Y!A for the phrase "Peace Corps" every week. I have a page devoted to the questions that come up the most frequently. At the bottom of the "pchead" page is a link to the Returned PCV web ring, which has 40+ other RPCV sites.    You can Google "Peace Corps Volunteer Blog" to find sites about more current experiences.|`|RKFrkgCGaa	They normally want an undergraduate education first.  Like the first person said, the only time they really overlook the lack of a degree is if you have a ton of other experience.  There is a way for you to work on your graduate degree and be in the Peace Corps at the same time.  Check out their website, it is packed with information.  Also, it takes an immense amount of emotional maturity to fulfill the Peace Corps assignment that most 18 year olds don't have yet.|`|D488G2nCaa	No, a college degree is required unless you have several years of experience in the field you want to volunteer in.

6Q4xh4F1aa	Before I left the Watchtower I had been in it for over forty years.  When my dad got too sick to work he asked for some help to feed us little kids and they told him to go to the Catholic church and wait in the breadline.  He was told that the watchtower was only taking money in. No money goes out except for buying printing matrerials and Kingdom properties.    There was a brother who was desperate for some antibiotics for  pneumonia back around 1989 or 1990. He was pretty old and not working. The brothers told him to go and get on Medi-Cal.  He had been there and the reason he was coming to his brothers was because he had been denied help because he was new to California.  When he explained this they said they were very sorry but they couldn't help him.    When I heard about him, my sister and I went to take him to the pharmacy.  No answer at the door.  We knocked and knocked and no answer.  We asked the landlady if she could open up so we could get him to the doctor.  He had been living in a one room apartment with no heat or electricity.  He was dead on the floor.  The poor man died because the Society has no benevolence and neither did his elders.    I pray very hard for our heavenly father YHWH to show these people mercy and allow them to hear the call of Jesus.  I hope He can forgive them because I don't think I ever will.|`|poyxZXUoaa	Well firstly, I don't donate to the Society expecting financial gains, that's what savings accounts at Banks are for.    That said, I've been helped and helped many in the congregation.  Ultimately, I don't expect ANYone in the congregation to pay my bills for me.|`|eRg04AoEaa	Yes we can.  Especially in times of disaster like the hurricanes or after 9-11. The Watchtower Society came to the aide of many people who needed it, not just fellow JW's either, but any they could help!|`|VJnuDRR9aa	My Husband and I went to NY to visit my parents who were up in age at the time.Everything went well except for a snow storm which made us have to hold over in a Motel until morning.We then  after our visit procceded home (Which was Indiana ) after we drove for awhile we had a flat tire and were able to get a new one easily since we were right near an exit.We did so and warmed up in there offices.    We continued on our ride home and again heavy snow un predicted by (the weather report) caused us to stop.We tried just stopping at a rest area but it was very cold for my Asthma so we again figured that in the morning we would just continue home .After all these stops and flat tire we had not allowed for this much of a extra expence but we were still OK because we had enough money for gas and food and still a little more about 50 dollars.   It became evening and we figured out that we were going to drive through and be home the next morning.  We stopped at a rest stop it was 9PM and when we went back to the car it would not start.The belt had broken.    The only thing we could think of was to call the Kingdom Hall in the area and see if some kind hearted brother could go to the local Walmrt get the belt and resque us.Its only 28 degrees.So we called  They were just finnished with their meeting .We explained our situation and the elder said "Didn't you prepare for unforseen occurances?"I said" yes we did and we had them too." Now we will pay the brother for his gas and the belt if someone could do this kindness for us I am having difficulty breathing and we would appreciate this kindness. He said "How do I know you are witnesses?"You know someone could just say that to get help!!" I said well the WT study sunday was on Such and such (don't rember now.) He siad anyone could know that all they need is a watchtower" I still would not give up and said Brother everyone does not know who Babylon the great is or the wild beast and the Jesus was Michael the archangel before he came to earth" Ask me a question He that won't be nessesary ,It is not our policy to go out in the middle of the night to resque people who should have known better then to get themselves in this position in the first place and we do have to go to work in the morning." So we were stranded . No heat ,broken car ,breathing problems and about 100 dollars to get home with.We tried another kingdom hall and if we could give them the phone number of our overseer in Indiana he would call and see if we were in good standing and come to help us.We did not have his number but tried to get it  He had a name we weren't spelling correctly and the operator could not find a listing for it. .Last try our son in law who was a witness in Indiana .He came and paid for our motel over night and breakfast he was a new witness he went and got the belt and had to take off a days work to do this for us, He drove from Indiana to Ohio to resque us .    When we were asked in our congregation what happened and told them they did not believe that such a thing could happen.We were told not to talk about it because it was not upbuilding.Then one elder privatly told us he called these brothers and they sort of denied it ,not actually outright but sort of.Makeing us liers and gossipers so that was the bonevolence we received the one time we asked in 35 years .from the worldwide brotherhood.    Yes our son in law was a witness but I think a son in law would resque  their in laws regardless.|`|cR8UZdi1aa	Of course we can go to our congregations for help & support. We wouldn't ever take advantage of them, just as I'm sure you wouldn't either. But I do agree with Ishvarlain that we (you included) do not give or donate expecting to get in return. But yes, we can count on our fellow JW's if we are in need of anything.|`|CmHLKKODaa	I my experience, No !  EDIT :  2 Timothy 3     5   holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these.      7  always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.    They have a Sometimes Love for one another but usually with conditions !|`|V6XVLbaGaa	I recall answering the phone at the Kingdom Hall one Saturday afternoon after field service (you remember the phone being in the overflow section near the bathrooms, no doubt?) and on the line was a crying woman, who poured out her story of desperation and financial need to me after finding out she'd reached the KH.  I think I was 15 years old, and I handed the phone to one of the brothers there, told him what I'd heard.     His reply I remember clear as day, "have to be careful, people call all the time just wanting money."    too bad she didn't preface her call with "i want a bible study, and while you're at it, can you bring some diapers and food?"    eh well.. the unChristlike behavior I experienced in my time in was enough to tell me they are not of Him.|`|W3ptH1JCaa	In 28 years of being a jw, I have only seen jw's expected to give and give to the watchtower society, with no expectation of any kind of return. Even when a new kingdom hall is built, the society "loans" donation money back to the congregation - with interest!! So then, on top of the regular contributions (of which there is an expected amount each month built into the so-called "expenses", the congregation has to pay a mortgage payment back to the society. Think about it - they're loaning the people's own money back to them - with interest! What could be more un-christian than that?    On top of that, the jw's have no, I repeat no community programs or any kind of material support for those in need. The only way a jw gets help from the organization is if an individual in the congregation takes it upon themselves to spend more of their own money to help. You will never see the society reaching into their pockets to help anybody but themselves.|`|uuSj24Xxaa	My dad has been an elder since the 1960s, now I am one. The short answer is NO you can expect NO HELP from the Society.      The long answer is HELLNO you can expect no help from the society.    If someone with a need "Qualifies", certain individuals might be LOANED money from one of the brothers, but direct help from the society is verboten.    If QiA answers this, tell them about that guy that died!

QnH9QuQwaa	Ironically, I used to be an Atheist.  I spend more time on here correcting Atheists then I do anything.  I've never seen so many people butcher the Theory of Evolution and the Big Bang Theory.  It's ridiculous.    The Atheists who know their stuff should be correcting them.  It's bad enough that Creationists are warping theories to their own will.  But Atheists?  I never thought I'd see the day.    The Atheists who actually have jobs in the Scientific Community are way less vicious and narrow-minded.  I get along with them great and rarely have any problems with them.  Often we have to agree to disagree, but have good chats and are constantly updating each other with new finds and articles.

lYx5qn6uaa	1) Male, 57y/o Doctor, because he's already experienced and med school grads come a dime a dozen.  2) Female, 51, runs orphanage because those kids have no one else while the three children of the mother probably have a father.  3) Male, 17, student because he's more self aware  4)Female, 24, drug dealer because I feel the shoplifter takes more away from the economy without contributing anything in return. (not saying drug dealers are good, but at least they're somewhat earning their profitt.)|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	Easy: they're all gonna die.|`|z6Eqgzpyaa	hmm id probably self destruct|`|OXP3tSuqaa	Actually, I want to choose who dies.

Male student.  I can't bring myself to condone the death of an infant.  I'm not that heartless.    4.  Drug dealer.  Shoplifters are bad enough, but dealers are a pestilence.    Sounds like a rush to judgement?  Why not, "God" does it every day.|`|sRvfF732aa	1) The 26 year old doctor can  live. The other guy will be retiring soon anyway, so really what use is he? lol    2) I will say that the mother of three should live. Her dying would have detrimental effects on her children, and someone else will be found to run the orphanage. It's not like the kids would be left to fend for themselves.    3) This is a tough one.

They are also becoming much more religious.  It sure hasn't hurt them.

It also has to assume that there will be no greed in it's government.  Hence, it fails.    edit:  Europe is better than us?  You obviously don't have a history text at home.

DCnDLfnSaa	I think that reading the Bible can often lead to confusion.  If you want to understand Jesus and Mary better, it's better to pray the rosary while meditating on the mysteries.  As St. Louis de Montfort tells us, praying the rosary eventually gives us a PERFECT knowledge of Jesus Christ.    I'm extemely grateful that you still believe in Mary's intercessory powers--take advantage of this grace.  St. Louis de Montfort recommends praying at least 15 decades of the rosary daily, and praying the Hail Marys ATTENTIVELY, concentrating on the words we say at each point in each Hail Mary.  This is very important; many Catholics get wrapped up in the meditations and forget this. I'd recommend reading "The Secret of the Rosary" by St. Louis de Montfort if you haven't already.  If we say the rosary poorly, we miss out on many graces as well as much of Mary's protection from the workings of Satan.    http://www.catholictradition.org/Classic...    Remember, Satan will try ardently to lead you away from the priesthood and the One True Faith.  You cannot succeed without a childlike devotion to Mary.  Also fast on bread and water, and offer your fasting to Mary for the conversion of sinners in reparation to her Immaculate Heart.  At the beginning of each day, offer all that day's sufferings for the same intention.    God bless!  Fred|`|G4SwEHP5aa	When you say Mary is the Mother of God.  Are you also claiming she is divine in nature and immune to sin?  If that is the case, that is a major flaw in Catholicism as a branch Christianity.    We protestants do not put any exclusion or exemption to Mary.  We honor her as a woman of exceptional virtue and follower of Christ but beyond that is reaching.    I also believe in the power of the intercessory prayers.  Catholics quotes St. Jerome's statement (paraphrasing), "If our Lord listens to the honored saints when they are alive, wouldn't He also listen to them when they are with Him?"    I can understand that but there was a time when 95% of the population had no access to the bible let alone literate enough to read and comprehend it.    Times have changed.  Now, we can come to Him personally knowing the full knowledge of the Bible and the gospel.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	You have spoken well sir!

Thanks for asking and good luck on your journey.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	I can't find one place in the Bible where it tells you to pray to saints.  Jesus is the only way to God.  You HAVE to worry about what the Bible says, it's the basis of the Christian faith.  It's God's word.  I love Catholics, I just can't be one of them because I can't pray or believe that their are saints or a pope.  The Bible never uses the word pope.  It says in the Bible that all believers are 'saints', meaning, followers of Christ.  Read and study your Bible dude, that's the only way you're going to know what's right.  I get along great with Catholics, I just think they worry too much about 'tradition' than they do the Bible.  As far as good works go, they don't get you into Heaven, salvation is a FREE gift.   We do our good works because we love Jesus and want to treat people the way Jesus would have treated them.  If you study, start with Acts.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	We cannot afford to be divided anymore.

He gave it to us, and gave us his Spirit to help us understand it.  He sent Jesus to live the perfect life for us, because we can do nothing at all to get to heaven. "Our righteousness is like filthy rags".  Don't worry about what the nun says, you read the Bible, and you ask Jesus to be your personal Savior, and you live your whole life for him.    "... you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy"  1 Peter 1:8  with Jesus, you can have that joy.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Your eyes are slowly being opened. Mary is a sinner just like you and I deserving eternal damnation , Luke 1:46 " And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,  47  And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour." Mary  is the Mother of Jesus , God is from everlasting to everlasting. Ephesians 2:8 " For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9  Not of works, lest any man should boast." Titus 3:5 " Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;" Not to worry on what the Bible says ? It IS the Word of God for man .Keep reading the Bible you will gain much needed knowledge. 2  Peter  1:2  "Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord," Romans 10:17  "So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." This site has great articles and sermons . www.fbbc.com|`|WjRqYf6naa	Very well spoken. We are really not so different at all. Works are certainly the product and not the means of salvation.|`|gIcg7Ug2aa	I'm not divided.  I'm in accord.|`|J85Ov4v6aa	Protestants have a closer relationship with the Lord because they seem to go to church more often and read the Bible more often than the average Catholic. I believe Catholics must be this way because they view their faith as only a part of their culture and not an important part of their daily lives (though I know this does not hold true to all Catholics and even Protestants can be just "Cultural Christians").   The truth is both Protestantism and Catholicism are right in certain areas of doctrine but wrong in others, there is no church as far as I can see that is perfectly correct in every area of doctrine and faith (even though some churches claim to be).  As a Christian I do not hold the same views as all my Protestant brethren neither do I agree with all of my Catholic brethren.  For instance I don't agree that Mary is an intercessory but that is my only personal opinion based on the fact that the Bible never really lifting her up as much as Catholics seem to do. It also seems strange to me that the first ever recorded prayer to her for intercessory was in 250 A.D. called "Under Thy Patronage" which was about 200 years after the death of Mary and most of the apostles, which is just way too late for it to really be an apostolic practice in my eyes.  This is also besides the fact that no early church father is recorded praying to her until late in the 4th century.  Mary is the "Mother of God" though as Christ was fully God and fully man and I can't say any Protestant would disagree with that but if they did they would be wrong and in a way denying Christ's deity.  I do also believe that you are saved by grace through faith and that works are just a product of your salvation because to me it just would not make sense if your works saved you, how many good works would be enough to be saved? The Catholic view is that faith plus works saves you but the Bible says "For by grace you are saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God" (Ephesians 2:8). But St. James says "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:20). The truth is if you say you have faith but never do good works you may not have true faith at all for faith alone justifies, but the faith that justifies is not alone - it produces good works (see Galatians 5:6).  Though our churches have differences we are all unified under Christ. Their is only one Church and that Church is Spiritual and Universal with many members of different churches.  Christ does not judge you by what church you attend but by your heart.  Now you ask what you should do. The truth is I'm not too sure what you should do nor do I have the authority to tell you what to do, you need to pray and ask God for His guidance.|`|EVby6dGCaa	Actually, I think you have it backwards, because instead of trying to say who's right, and seeing all the differences, why not see that we're all right in different ways. Salvation can be worked out in many ways.    You're now Catholic. Fine! Be a good Catholic!    At some point in time, if you begin to feel that another approach is better for your personal needs, it's also fine to go to that new place, whatever it might be. People do this all the time, and sometimes they even return. That's okay too.    You see, we all have a piece of the puzzle. But every single one of us is also wrong in some ways too. The RCCs make me crazy because they just keep insisting that they have the whole, complete story, and of course they don't, and a child can see tha they don't.    So, wherever you feel you get the best situation to help you grow, go with that.     It will be fine.|`|6bKws0fAaa	Here let me tell you the truth and in all honesty, i do not have the intention of bashing catholicism. i just hope you keep an open mind when i tell you this    first of all...does not God say worship no other but me? in the ten commandments he states that You shall have no other gods before me and  You shall not make for yourself an idol    catholics pray to Mary and other saints right? well this is a contradiction to God's law...your praying to mary and not God. mary was a human. mary sinned! mary was by all means not greater to God. she even called jesus "lord" many times. mary was a wonderful servant of God and she was faithful and obedient. i admire her faith but i will not worship her. mary was used as an instrument of God to bring Jesus Christ into the world. she was the Physical mother of jesus the man, but Jesus Christ was the Father of mary. without jesus, mary would have had no hope. so I strongly disagree that she is the mother of God, the physical mother of jesus, but God has no mother. Jesus is God and God is Jesus. so who is greater? God or Mary? ....God of course! please understand that mary was a servant and no mother of God. so she is in no way superior to Him, Jesus is superior to Mary. Instead we should focus on our ONE ON ONE RELATIONSHIP TO GOD. when you get to heaven the Lord will not ask you....how was your relationship with Mary and with the other saints  the lord will ask you....how was your relationship with my son Jesus. did you ever talk to Him one on one. Mary should be considered a role model and an example but not we should pray to    Second of all: works are a product of salvation not a mean to salvation! what would have been the point of jesus christ dying for us if we could have been good in our lives and go to heaven regardless of our sins??!!  that's not how it works. instead jesus saved us and enters into our hearts, then we begin to live righteously. then we will produce good works and fruit. not the other way around. we are saved by HIS grace NOT OUR actions. we are not our own saviors.     third: that nun was dead wrong. i am shocked she would say such a thing. the Bible is the word of God AND NOTHING ELSE MATTERS BUT CONFORMING OUR LIVES TO THE WORD OF GOD. OUR GOAL IN LIFE IS TO GET AS CLOSE AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO OBEYING EVERY SINGLE THING IN THE BIBLE. THE BIBLE IS THE ONLY SOURCE OF TRUE AUTHORITY BESIDES GOD ON THIS WORLD. no popes, no fathers, no priests, no nuns, no saints have more authority than the own word of God. so everything you read in the Bible must be acted upon, then you will be wise.       :now for some historical value of the truth of catholicism....in my AP world history class I learned that catholicism is actually a blend or a mixture between paganism and christianity. when the disciples brought christianity to europe people accepted it more because the christian saints seemed more like pagan heroes to the people. so what they did is kept two of the traditions. the christian ones and the pagan ones. catholicism is not the christianity that jesus  christ and his disciples created. catholicism is paganism/christianity. Protestantism was founded by Martin Luther [a once catholic monk] who actually read the bible, realized that it was totally contradictory to what catholics were teaching, and he founded protestantism upon the Bible and solely the bible. you tell me. which is more truthful. the supreme word of God himself, or a religion fused with paganism and christianity.     my answer to you is: protestantism    it is based solely upon the bible. many aspects of what Catholics teach have no biblical meaning and the bible never teaches the stuff taught in cathedrals.   Follow the word of God my friend,  disregard everything else  and make your life identical to what the Bible says   study it, learn it, memorize it if you must!  but this is the only reliable source of God on this planet. nothing else.   so chance is, if you learn something that isn't anywhere in the bible, it was made up by man and not God|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	ever consider that they all might be wrong?|`|nJTIkwSfaa	Dream stuff i'm from Northern Ireland, and it makes me so mad that every reference of religion has to be brought back to northern ireland.

This advice alone should get you thinking!    Try reading a non-Catholic Bible. Ot try this, read the writings from the first century. See for yourself what they taught few years after the time of the Apostles.    You can find them here:    http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/      For an example, this is what St. John Chrysostom says about Mary's position as the mother of Jesus:    St. John Chrysostom - HOMILIES ON MATTHEW 12:46-50  That which I was lately saying, that when virtue is wanting all things are vain, this is now also pointed out very abundantly. For I indeed was saying, that age and nature, and to dwell in the wilderness, and all such things, are alike unprofitable, where there is not a good mind; but to-day we learn in addition another thing, that even to have borne Christ in the womb, and to have brought forth that marvellous birth, hath no profit, if there be not virtue.    And this is hence especially manifest. "For while He yet talked to the people," it is said, "one told Him, Thy mother and Thy brethren seek Thee. But He saith, who is my mother, and who are my brethren?"And this He said, not as being ashamed of His mother, nor denying her that bare Him; for if He had been ashamed of her, He would not have passed through that womb; but as declaring that she hath no advantage from this, unless she do all that is required to be done. For in fact that which she had essayed to do, was of superfluous vanity; in that she wanted to show the people that she hath power and authority over her Son, imagining not as yet anything great concerning Him; whence also her unseasonable approach. See at all events both her self-confidence and theirs. Since when they ought to have gone in, and listened with the multitude; or if they were not so minded, to have waited for His bringing His discourse to an end, and then to have come near; they call Him out, and do this before all, evincing a superfluous vanity, and wishing to make it appear, that with much authority they enjoin Him. And this too the evangelist shows that he is blaming, for with this very allusion did he thus express himself, "While He yet talked to the people;" as if he should say, What? was there no other opportunity? Why, was it not possible to speak with Him in private?    And what was it they wished to say? For if it were touching the doctrines of the truth, they ought to have propounded these things publicly, and stated them before all, that the rest also might have the benefit: but if about other matters that concerned themselves, they ought not to have been so urgent. For if He suffered not the burial of a father, lest the attendance on Him should be interrupted, much less ought they to have stopped His discourse to the people, for things that were of no importance. Whence it is clear, that nothing but vainglory led them to do this; which John too declares, by saying, "Neither did His brethren believe on Him;" and some sayings too of theirs he reports, full of great folly; telling us that they were for dragging Him to Jerusalem, for no other purpose, but that they themselves might reap glory from His miracles. "For if thou do these things," it is said, "show Thyself to the world. For there is no man that doeth anything in secret, and seeketh himself to be manifest;" when also He Himself rebuked them, attributing it to their carnal mind. That is, because the Jews were reproaching Him, and saying, "Is not this the carpenter's son, whose father and mother we know? and His brethren, are not they with us?" they, willing to throw off the disparagement caused by His birth, were calling Him to the display of His miracles.    For this cause He quite repels them, being minded to heal their infirmity; since surely, had it been His will to deny His mother, He would have denied her then, when the Jews were reproaching Him. But as it is, we see that He takes so great care of her, as even at the very cross to commit her to the disciple whom He loved most of all, and to give him a great charge concerning her.    But now He doth not so, out of care for her, and for His brethren. I mean, because their regard for Him was as towards a mere man, and they were vainglorious, He casts out the disease, not insulting, but correcting them.    But do thou, I pray, examine not the words only, which contain a moderate reproof, but also the unbecoming conduct of His brethren, and the boldness wherewith they had been bold and who was the person reproving it, no mere man, but the only-begotten Son of God; and with what purpose He reproved; that it was not with intent to drive them to perplexity, but to deliver them from the most tyrannical passion and to lead them on by little and little to the right idea concerning Himself, and to convince her that He was not her Son only, but also her Lord: so wilt thou perceive that the reproof is in the highest degree both becoming Him and profitable to her,|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	Too many humans have decided what they think the Bible means, and not all "Christians" agree. I also believe that Mary is Jesus' mother, but I don't pray to her, or think she has any special power. She is not a god. There are too many differences between denominations for everyone to agree. I think we all just need to agree that the Bible is God's word and Jesus is His son, and we'll be fine.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Because your god inspired such a vague, contradicting book that it can be interpreted in many different ways.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Because it's a growing process.  Some people never stop growing.    Keep learning, and following up on what people say to you.  Eventually you'll figure out what is best for you.    The only real stupid people in this world are the ones that think they know everything.    And you are correct on that...the good works are a PRODUCT of the grace we receive through faith and testify to our faith in Jesus.  That's why the bible indicates that we are judged according to our works/deeds.    EDIT:  I'm a Catholic, and I wouldn't pay much attention to what that nun told you lol...maybe she didn't mean it the way you make it sound, but that doesn't sound like good advice to me.  Read your bible, but don't just trust in your own interpretations either.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	Us little guys can get along much easier than the bosses.    There is a part in the Bible where Jesus is accused of driving out demons because he used the power of Satan.  Jesus laughed at the idea of Satan working against Satan. He then said, "A house divided will fall."  If we, as believers in God and Jesus, are divided, we cannot build up a strong faith.    Or as I like to put it, God sees the different churches as different body parts. Some have the purpose of the eyes to see what is happening - others have the role of the feet to take God's message out to others.  The problem churches have is they think all parts should be like them - so the eyes accuse the feet of being blind, while the feet accuse the eyes of being crippled.  The feet are not meant to see, nor the eyes meant to walk.  But when we overcome our divisions, we can function properly like a whole body should|`|7n0MlfQJaa	First I'd like to say that there is not one single contradiction in the Bible. To those who say so please read it instead of relying on some made up lies on some satanic web sites. Now to answer your question to the best of my ability. I believe the Bible is the only source of Biblical truth. Protestants are correct. Catholics mean well but there loyalty is missplaced Jesus said we are all kings and "Priests" not just a few chosen. You are correct the Bible does teach that Good works are a result of salvation and not the means to it. I believe that the Southern Baptists have it right that is why i joined them.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Here is your answer, "The nun I talked to said to not worry so much what the bible says" Think about that for a min.  The bible says "all scripture is for correction and teaching and God breathed." This means that we are to study and use the bible to learn about God. the bible also says, "Faith comes from hearing the word of God". Reading the bible is hearing God's word which increases faith!    I used to attend the Roman Cath church (RCC) as a kid. My parents quit going.  Later I had a prayer answered that was AMAZING and knew God was calling me. So I decided to find out which church was a good one.  i started reading the New test for my self.   Later I came to know of a movement from the 1800's called, "the  restoration Movement". This was started by  a group of clergy that wanted to get back to where the first church was. Where they relied on Scripture and not the Traditions of man esp. when those Traditions contradicted the bible.  The churches from the restoration movement are Church of Christ, Disciples of Christ and the Christian church.    The bible says we have ONLY one mediator to God, Jesus the Christ 1 tim.  Is Mary Omnipresent? Can she hear all our prayers at  once? No.  Why was Mary barely mentioned after Jesus' Ascension? Why when in Revelation when it was asked, "Who is worthy to open the scrolls?" Only Jesus was worthy.   Why does Mary thank God for her salvation? Salvation from what? the answer is sin.  No where in the bible does it say she was sinless yet the bible says Jesus was-why would it not mention she was?    Pray and read for yourself, Maybe God is calling YOU!    ?|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I would suggest you not get so worried about what people think and pay attention to what God says, and that can be found in His word, the bible.    P.S.  Very bad advice, if someone told you not to pay attention "to what the bible says".|`|Lc5FtItDaa	You should pray and ask God what He wants you to do.    Then you should continue to study, and God will make the right thing make sense.    Protestants also believe Mary is the mother of God.    Yes, works are an effect not a cause.    Why would a religious person tell you not to worry about God's word?  Does she think it contradicts her view?|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	A lot of Catholics have close relationships with God, maybe you aren't getting to know them. I am close to God, and I am Catholic, so are my priests (Which I hope to become one day.) I also see this division and I agree with you, we are brothers and sisters in Christ. But Faith without works is dead, please understand that you NEED to repent for your sins, and it is necessary for salvation, or we are not taking responsibility for our sins.|`|HBp5r76haa	"And Protestants view of salvation seems Biblical."  YOU NAILED IT! IT IS BIBLICAL!!    "Can't the works mean that they are living as Christ wanted to and is a PRODUCT of salvation not a MEANS OF salvation? Just wondering."  ABSOLUTELY WHAT JAMES MEANS BY 'FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD"    We can all get along, but do we believe in the same God? In the same Jesus Christ?  Our Christ is God the Son, and the ONLY mediator to the Father, no other person, as holy as you think they are, could ever be able to intercede for us with the Father. So we will never agree in Mary's intercession powers.    She is indeed the mother of God (God the Son, Jesus Christ) but she is not supernatural. A very blessed woman, that's all.    We also can't accept the Pope's infallibility and the necessity of confessing our sins to a priest. Neither is biblical...|`|tManvxfQaa	' The Bible ' is the 'WORD' of God...    how can you not be concerned with what it says ?    Jesus IS the Living Word  TO deny  ' IT ' is to Deny God Himself !!    IN the beginning was the WORD   The WORD was with God  and the WORD was God !!      And one cannot just agree with any tradition or custom or doctrine of men  IT has to be GOD and HIS WORD , by HIS SPIRIT    OR its NOT God at All !!|`|IqPz1PZOaa	Wow, I hay yet to view a more mature and inquisitive inquiry into what helps the very most, and probably builds much greater in-depth discussions, with diversity rather than singularity.  More simply said as this, If everybody was the same, there might be very little up for discussion.  Wow!  Truly the best question!!|`|UARQA0CLaa	You stated "I can't talk to my parents about this cause I tried to once, but they got mad.    The nun I talked to said not to worry so much about what the Bible says"    That is the problem in a nut shell.  Parents get mad and religious leaders tell us not to worry about what the Bible says.  The reason we can't get along, is because as Christians we follow the Bible (New Testament teaching of Jesus).  We don't follow man made doctrine (Catholicism).      You also stated  "I still believe in Mary's intercessory".  Where in the Bible is that found.  You need to take the time to search the scriptures, like the Berian's did to see if the things being told to you are true, and are God's word.

Hint: 'La' is ALWAYS used before a noun ending with the letter 'A' (of course, it still appplies when the noun ends in 'A' in singular form but 'S' in plural form) . It helps to think of it this way: nouns ending with the letter 'A' are feminine.  Eg. la ni?a.      The other steadfast rule is nouns ending with the letter 'O' in which case you'll always have 'El' in front. Where it all becomes unclear is nouns ending in other vowels/consonants not mentioned above.  You should consider whether the noun is masculine or feminine (eg the letter 'R': La Flor and El Se?or).

AA11312653	As insensitive as your co-worker may be, it's rarely a good idea to take offence where no offence is intended. Almost everyone has some outstanding physical characteristic -- big nose, tall, kinky hair, blotchy complexion, moles, heavy eyebrows, whatever -- and we just have to toughen up and get used to people noticing it. Is this lady perhaps from the South? In some parts of the country it is a complementary remark to say that a young lady is "a fine big healthy looking girl" or words to that effect. People can't help but notice if you are bigger than average, but that doesn't necessarily mean that find your size unattractive or repellant.     If you think it is hard being a big girl, just wait until you are an old lady and you can really get ticked off, LOL!

Or you could be sneaky and do the same thing to her.  Pick a feature about her that you can work into a similar comment.  Then you gauge her reaction.  If she doesn't react, she's oblivious.  If she does react, then you have a chance to bring up your issue with her.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I have two answers for this.    First, consider whether or not what she is saying is true. If these people are indeed bigger than you, she is speaking the truth. Perhaps you are sensitive to any mention of your weight in comparison to someone else, and you are unnecessarily offended.       The other option I see is that she really is saying this in a rude way, and it doesn't matter if it's on purpose or not. The solution is you flat out tell her - hey that makes me feel bad, I'm happy with my own weight. She'll probably say she didn't mean it like that, and I'd give her the benefit of the doubt. If she's a nice person, she won't do it anymore, or will at least notice and apologize if she slips up and says it again.      Edit: I have to strongly disagree with people who are advising you to be confrontational, angry, throw insults back, etc. That sort of action is really uncalled for, especially when you are not certain of the lady's motives. She could really be oblivious to how you feel.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I just wanted to add a forth option to Winters, as her answer basically covers it.    4) You can continue to make make excuses for this woman's horribly immature behavior and allow her to continue to tear you down.    You need to sternly confront her, even if you have a hard time with it.  I would do it in front of all the same people she insults you in front of.      If you respect yourself at all you will put a stop to this.    Edit:  Nobody in here has said to 'be aggressive' or 'insulting'.  All I've read, and said, is to confront it.  I said to be stern because if your not it can be taken too lightly.  'Stern' is not the same as 'aggressive.'  I am stern with my children when I correct their bad behaviors.    I say to confront it in front of the others because they have been witness to this bad behavior, and they too should see that it is unacceptable and has not gone unnoticed.

If she does it again it is intentional.|`|7aed9f483dc1c720c29eedd88a2b86ddaa	this has been irking you, because you know the truth, this woman IS insulting you INTENTIONALLY.  she is old enough to know what she is saying to others.  and the fact that she says it in front of others and has done this as you say three times, is no an accident by any means. you have three options...1. go to human resources and report her...2.  pull her aside and tell her that you do not appreciate her comments....or 3.  let her insult you again in front of others and have a really good come back.|`|hAqPziGzaa	Yes, say something. Tell her the truth the next time she does it, that you feel as if sometimes she is making fun of your weight, but she doesn't notice it. That way you catch her red handed and have other examples ready. However, you don't need to be rude about it.

You can say it with a smile and not in a nasty manner but not sticking around will indicate that you aren't going to stay around to listen to this gossip.  And that's what it is, gossip.  Every time she does something like this, just walk away.  She (and everyone else) will get the message that you aren't going to stand there and take it.  If they want to talk about you behind your back, so be it but you aren't going to join in and using you in her comparisons is not going to fly with you.  Don't get hostile or angry, just walk away.  They'll start worrying about offending you and stop.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	I'm not sure HOW old she is...but I've realized that older women (70s-80s) are incredibly blunt and often don't think of what they are saying could possibly be hurtful.  Are you are really close with her you could mention that when she talks about your size like that...that it hurts.  She will most likely be mortified and take steps to correct her behavior.    Good luck!

oYVxMmbQaa	Oh my goodness, I'd love to live in a multilingual area. I've always taken an interest in languages. My dad speaks fluent Spanish and my mom speaks French. I've taken a few Spanish classes and I've spend almost seven years learning French. Being exposed to different languages, cultures, and customs is really the one of the main joys of being on this planet. You broaden your horizons and learn more about the world around you. Sadly, many people in this country believe that by allowing others to speak their native language, we're losing our "American-ness." But really, America's history is filled with different groups of people coexisting (not always peacefully) under the belief that maybe one day the American Dream will be ours. To deny these people part of who they are in order for them to assimilate only destroys what is so interesting about America: diversity.|`|iWaU76T5aa	I would hate to live in a multilingual area because of the fact that I would not understand what others are saying and someone might be talking junk about me and I might now know at all as to what is happening. Also, you feel excluded from that society because you cannot speak their language. Often times (Spanish speakers do this A LOT, Asian language speakers don't do this much) many of the speakers of the foreign language will look down upon you for not knowing their language.    ENGLISH SHOULD be the official language of the US because it is the common denominator. For example a person may know Spanish and another may know Chinese, but in the US both have English in common and it lets communication occur between the two. WHY NOT let English  be the official language? Because some hippie out in California does not want to get the immigrants offended?    I really do believe it is beautiful that people bring their languages over to the US and when they speak them it is great. I love it when that happens, I find Hindi to be a great language though, far superior than Spanish (which is shoved down our throats).       THE ONLY opposition I have with foreign languages is that our low rate education system requires our students to take them in HIGH SCHOOL. Education in high school should be expanded upon and classes like Law should be mandatory instead of foreign languages. I rather that we get those out of the way in Elementary and Middle school (make a foreign language mandatory from 1st to 7th grade, let the student decide which language he wants to take). Keep foreign languages from being mandatory in high school and whats worse is some states have SUCH an egregious school system that you are required to take Spanish as a foreign language and no other language except Spanish (yes California is a trashy state).|`|WYo59zLOaa	I already do, I live around Asians who speak Chinese and Koreans, a few Mexicans that speak Spanish and of course black people that speak ebonics. I just wished I had Italians and Germans around.|`|T3Tpgz5Vaa	I'd rather take time to learn languages of my choosing (working on Japanese (Rossetta Stone), then I will start learning Russian, maybe then Chinese, but that's it). I don't want to be required to learn a language not of my choosing or else risk being ostracized out of my own country.    Plus if I was going to move and live in Germany, I wouldn't expect them to all learn english for me. I'm actually learning these langauges just for the purpose of visiting those countries in the future, its generally respectful to do so anyways.|`|5qFmukWwaa	I would love to live (again) in a multi-lingual and multi-cultural neighborhood.  The more exposure we have, especially when young, to people who are different from ourselves the more understanding and accepting we become.  When I was 5 we lived in Hawaii (1956 - not at all like it is now) and if you look at my kindergarten picture you will see every race and culture you can imagine.  Going home with a new friend was always a great adventure and you never knew what customs you would find or what you would have for dinner. Oh man that was a great time!

How can one nation so in debt be allowed to continue living as comfortably as it does while there is so much poverty and needless human suffering in nations it owes money to?    I'm amazed that people think the economy is going to get better, even though US and Mexico oil wells will run dry in nine years and the US is in no position to recover from a 50% decrease in oil supply.     Keeping your head in the sand must be better than seeing the problems. That's why the news won't discuss things like this.     Or were you looking for a positive answer? Bradjolina. They are amazing. LoL
zLRIlh14aa	I wouldn't really call any language easy. Some are easier than others to learn. It depends on whether you're a native English speaker or not.    For an English speaker, Japanese would be very hard. It consists of three alphabets with numerous symbols, as well as kanji and a completely different way of writing and reading. Other hard languages may be Arabic or Chinese.    For a non English speaker, I'd think English would most likely be the hardest to learn, with many rules that make it harder.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	English is the hardest language to learn (even for natives it's confusing). There are no set grammar rules or if there are we never pay attention to them. Pronounciation changes, such as "rough", "Though" the GH is pronounced like an F or not pronounced at all, or Read and Read. Which one is past tense, which is present?     There is no "easy" language since it depends on what you speak as a native. If you speak English, something else that's Germanic (such as German) would be easy, as would some romance languages like French and Spanish. (despite what people are saying, Japanese isn't that hard... the writing system is confusing, sure, but languages in general aren't as hard as they are said to be if you really try).    It depends on your native language, but I think English is the hardest.|`|AA10948829	As a native English speaker, Japanese, Mandarin and Cantonese Chinese, and Arabic are determined to be the most difficult.

Although ENglish is one of the easiest as it is so basic.  German is another easy one.  Italian is harder than Spanish.  But this are all languages that follow the same rules as English.  If you want a challenge try learning, Hebrew, Arabic, Mandarin, kantonese, Japanese any one of those will be a real challenge.|`|BeAVEk2yaa	I'd say the hard ones are Hebrew and Arabic.    The easiest are probably Spanish and German. Spanish because it is simple and German because it is so close to English.     For non-native English speakers, English is for SURE the hardest. It is very complex with all the tenses, rules, and all the exceptions to the rules.|`|JUai6qwaaa	I'd say English because it makes up its own words as it needs to or likes ("super-size"; "brunch"); because its roots come from so many other languages (Latin, Greek, German); and because the rules for spelling and pronunciation  are irregular vs. other languages (aught, taught, thought, drought, dough, knife, etc.).    And although Russian is pretty complex, it has rules that make it pretty easy to learn if you follow the rules and learn declentions. But I'd say Spanish is easiest because you say what you read (mostly) and it's relatively consistent as to the rules of grammar and spelling.
6JnAOYCYaa	Hello Megan    From experience, due to a cloudy mind, any advice given will just confuse more.     Take some time out for searching for answers & I promise that your mind will clear as well as having answers arrive.     Sadhara    see profile|`|P0EAzyw8aa	you are in some need of grounding to keep things in check, email me if you want more info.|`|uqDSuFMtaa	You seem to have a general lack of focus, despite all your attempts to do so. You jump from one thing to another to give you "answers". Apparently, you are getting the answers you want to hear. That does not mean they are not "true",  just that you approach your questions with an idea of what answer you want to have. Wrong! Let go of any expectation as to what is shown. I would have to say that the lack of dedicated focus may be affecting your relationship and the level of satisfaction you get from it. In the love vs confusion question, I'd say that you are really, at this point, "in love" with the fairytale idea of what a relationship is. You say that YOU have contemplated your relationship---there's two of you in it, if I'm not mistaken, so what have the two of you discussed about what you both want from the relationship and what your personal goals are? Open the dialog with your partner and be truthful about what you want to see happening. If you are thinking of jumping into a different relationship, then you have some very serious matters to talk about with your current partner before you go chasing after those "greener pastures".
7aueTuAXaa	You could participate in some of the collection drives that are then sent to military personnel who then distribute the items to those who need them.    Like Beanies for Baghdad - you send small stuffed animals, small toys, soccer balls and the soldiers hand them out to the children - thus promoting peace by showing that the soldiers do good things    Or Operation Give that collects a variety of items.    Or there is the Operation Christmas Child where you put things like toys and toothbrush/toothpaste/soap, etc. into a shoe box and then send them as gifts  to children in other countries.      I'll list links to several ideas for you.

The joys at that time will far outweigh any suffering that people have experienced. Life will not be disturbed by any bad memories of previous suffering. The up-building thoughts and activities that will be the everyday life of people will gradually erase the painful memories.  By means of his Kingdom, God will completely reverse the bad situation that has lasted so long.

The thought in 1978 ish was definitely (so I thought) that armageddon preceeded the 1000 year rule. Am I really wrong on this?  Edit. Almost all the things mentioned by the responders could be accomplished now. Think about it, please.

Sleeping on my sides makes my arm go to sleep so I have to roll over, but sleeping on my back my back sometimes gets too hot so I roll to the other side until that arm goes to sleep then I roll onto my stomach.  Until I droll so much the wet pillowcase wakes me up.  In December, I had injured my arm so I could only sleep on my back and I got very little sleep.  If it is very cold, since we don't heat the bedrooms, I will sometimes pull the covers over my head but leave my face open to the air (kind of like a hoodie).

3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	I don't think you need my approval or anyone else's to get a divorce.  However, from a purely scriptural point of view you have grounds for a divorce.  On top of that, you tried very hard to save your marriage.  I think if you get a divorce you should do so without guilt or regret and without making excuses for it.  You've been through a lot and you sound like a very strong lady.  I wish you the very best.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	he broke the marriage vows... go and be free|`|k03dYskYaa	Jesus said that the only Scriptural basis for divorce that frees one to remarry is porneia, gross sexual immorality (like adultery, homosexuality, etc.. on the part of the other marriage mate. (Matthew 5:32; 19:9)   Jehovah is not displeased with those who choose to divorce on proper Scriptural grounds.  It's not condemned in the Bible for the innocent mate to seek a divorce. So it's a personal decision.  However, By resuming sexual relations, the innocent mate would be indicating that she has decided to be reconciled with her erring mate. She or he would thereby nullify any Scriptural ground for divorce.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	God hates divorce because of the harm it does to people and families. God does not want you to be abused.

He understands the pain and betrayal so if God says its okay to divorce your husband on these grounds I would go for it and not look back.

He failed to keep the promise.  He promised to be faithful.  He failed in that promise as well.  He promised to love and cherish you. He failed in that way as well.    He broke his vows. He has proven time and again that he is unworthy of trust. If you take him back again, you're only sending him the message that what he's doing is fine.    File for divorce and move on. He neither wants nor deserves a wife.|`|AA11622701	Even by the strictest reading of the divorce rules in the Bible, adultery by your spouse is grounds for a divorce.  If you read more than just Jesus' words (which were in answer to a specific question and never intended as an "end all" statement on divorce), the Mosaic Law also allowed divorce in the case of abandonment, or if the husband refused to provide food and shelter for the family.  (Also in cases of physical abuse, which you did not mention.)  So I would see no Bible reason not to divorce him.|`|AA11682977	~~  you did not break your promise to him, he is the one in the wrong ! God does not like men that have no backbone, yours has marsh-mellows for a spine.   divorce is forgivable, think of the woman at the well, she had 5 husbands and was living with a man even now. Jesus gave her truth and she went on to tell the whole town and caused many to be saved.  move on with your life. this man is not for any woman that wants a mate. he is not worth even a tear. pray for any wrong you might have done in the relationship and get a divorce. then ask God to send you the person He wants you to have. when you meet him pray for both of you to make the right choice. do not take old feeling with you on the new match. trust God to give you someone that will love you. ~~|`|bC5XeVEIaa	Ok, I'm agnostic and entirely against organized religion. So I'm going to tell you this upfront: I don't believe you should base any decisions on your personal happiness or suffering on the supposed spiritual ramifications written in an ancient tome. Be a person, not a sheep. Do not allow life or anyone in it to trample you because you think that God may be upset otherwise.    That being said, yes. This is an absolutely appropriate reason for divorce. He was manipulative and abusive, and he took advantage of your forgiving and caring disposition for his own personal gain. He wanted to have his cake and eat it, too, and he never once thought about your feelings or the feelings of your child.    Do you really want to continue suffering through an abusive marriage based on spiritual faith? Do you want to waste the certainty of this life based on the possibility of the next?    In the end, it's your choice. But if it was me, I wouldn't continue punishing myself.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	I wouldn't condemn you in the slightest.

Second, even if you go by the very narrow strictures of the Christian scriptures, it says that a man may divorce his wife for "fornication."  (The lawbooks of the time were written in terms of men, of course).    I'd say either way, you're off the hook.  Tell the bugger to take a hike!|`|EM0kiImHaa	You have every right to divorce him.

If "god" wants you to stay with a man who emotionally abuses you and treats you like crap, is that really a "god" you want to worship?|`|SvEzmp4Laa	You truly gave the relationship your all.  You have no reason to feel guilty about getting a divorce.  Go on with your life.  I wish you and your daughter the best.|`|533z6lWpaa	Hahaha...I didn't read the entire details, but here's the thing: I don't have any right to condemn you! Let him without sin cast the first stone. Sure, I don't support it, but I'm not in the position to judge and determine how you should live your life. Much love and keep the faith. Things will turn up for the better.|`|1bb0f7ae2b31d51224421eb6bee127fbaa	Your husband has given you biblical grounds for divorce.  You have to do what is right for you and your daughter and whatever you decide it is between you and God.  Don't worry about what other people think, they don't live your life.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	You had an acceptable reason to divorce the first time.  God wants you to respect your marriage, but you are not the one who fooled around and committed adultery.  It should be pretty clear that you should remain spiritually married if that is what you must do to be happy, but you should get the secular divorce from this poor excuse for a husband.      That means no more letting this hypocrite back into your life.  If this isn't clear to you by now, then you are deliberately asking for the pain you receive in the future.    I hope this helps.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	you could I have divorced him off the jump, I would have. :)    Since he cheated of course. :)|`|5ZdP5AIZaa	Jesus Christ, in his Sermon on the Mount, stated: Moreover it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. However, I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except on account of fornication, makes her a subject for adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. (Mt 5:31,?32) Also, after telling the Pharisees that the Mosaic concession of divorcing their wives was not the arrangement that had prevailed from the beginning, Jesus said: I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery. (Mt 19:8,?9) Today, generally, distinction is made between fornicators and adulterers. According to modern usage, those guilty of fornication are unmarried persons who willingly have sexual relations with someone of the opposite sex. Adulterers are married persons who willingly have sexual relations with a member of the opposite sex who is not their legal marriage mate. As shown in the article FORNICATION, however, the term fornication is a rendering of the Greek word por?neia and includes all forms of illicit sexual relations outside of Scriptural marriage. Hence, Jesus words at Matthew 5:32 and 19:9 mean that the only divorce ground that actually severs the marriage bond is por?neia on the part of ones marriage mate. The follower of Christ may avail himself of that divorce provision if that is his desire, and such a divorce would free him to marry an eligible Christian.1Co 7:39.|`|uFyycbjiaa	Sometimes things don't work out and divorce is necessary.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I'm Roman Catholic.  I would not condemn you at this point or at any other point.  Neither would The Church.   I and The church would, however, like to see your marriage succeed.  It sounds from what you have said, though, that your husband has decided to divorce you.  If that is the case, there might be little or nothing you can do to stop this.  If he is still in the Marines,  his superiors might want to know about some of the activities you have described,  especially if he is an officer.  The Church does not recognize civil divorces, but The Church also does not deny the necessity to take appropriate steps to protect yourself and your children.  The Church recognizes that this can sometimes require a legal separation. You would not be free to get married unless your husband dies or you obtain a "declaration of nullity", commonly called "an annulment".  Whether you should have done anything differently is something that only you, your husband and God can know.   I'm deeply sorry that this situation has come to be so painful for you.  Concerning your relationship with The Church and God, you would not be committing a sin unless you willingly abandon your marriage or children, or if you get married to another man while your husband is still alive without first obtaining an annulment.    I pray for Peace.  May Peace be with you.|`|AOumB12eaa	if he cheated on you, its ok. you know god talks about deviorce in the bible.. im not sure exactly where it is.. but its in there.|`|67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Marriage is not a contract that can be declared invalid because one party does not uphold his part of the vows.  Marriage is a life long covenant that cannot be dissolved.  Get your marriage declared invalid by teh church.  Then you can remarry with a clear conscience.    Protestants will tell you that Jesus said that a person may divorce in case of adultery, but that is a faulty translation.  The correct translation is "except if the marriage is illegal", such as marriage between close blood relatives or other situations described in Leviticus.|`|PWankIUpaa	I do not condemn but the Holy Bible dose! This is the problem of non believers , they think that Christians go around condemning everyone and are seeking approval from believers! Yet Believers do not condemn they a are sinning against the Holy and Inerrant Word of God not us and it is His Law that Condemns!  However He has made a way for us to avoid condemnation and Judgment ! Simply by asking Jesus to come into your life and take your sins He will give you Pardon!    John 3:16-18|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Do you really think God wants you to stay in a relationship with a man who, first of all broke his vows to you the first time he cheated on you so in effect the "contract" was null and void as of that moment and secondly is leaving you open to STDs by tom-catting all around town?  You think about that.|`|cd87288852b5c01e64c902f0433720abaa	Mathew 5:30-31  31 It has been said, Anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.?a?  32 But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to become an adulteress, and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery.     "EXPECT FOR MARITAL UNFAITHFULNESS" I am going through a similar situation with my husband, I found out he was cheating on me while I was pregnant with our son and now we are on the rocks, he hasn't left the house because he says he wants to try but I know he still talks to her behind my back, and he is being really mean to me, like if everything is in my head or is my fault. This is a very difficult situation, we marry and we think is going to be forever so when we get into this situations our first thought is "what is God going to think"?. I tell you this, even God respects divorce when one of the spouses is unfaithful, he hates divorce but justifies it when someone doesn't respect the covenant of marriage, in other words, even though God hates divorce, is ok to do it from unfaithfulness.  Good luck, I know exactly what you are going through, I don't deserve it either, I was a good wife and I trusted him unconditionally, but God has out backs, God doesn't give us something we can not handle, and God is going to be there for you, divorced or married, He is there.  Hope this helps... Good luck.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	Yes honey.  When someone treats you that badly, you need to get away from them.  If God loves you, why would he want you to stay with someone who makes you so miserable.    (((virtual hugs))) and take care of yourself.
871ea50d251ea84b03eb405148721ecbaa	No, but in a way Yes, because whether the theists like it or not, truth is relative where religion and theology is concerned.|`|52246014c6731089215da64339f2d610aa	yes|`|FrZkfexqaa	Wow it's interesting how you asking this question so many people turned it into a religious debate, I don't even see the word religion in the question:  Interesting!!

Every religion or theory can't be right.|`|VncSMLMpaa	Only in your own mind.    It is really oftentimes only the product of an overactive imagination. You only need to speak to someone with a serious mental disease to realise what distortions of understanding can occur.     There are also those who have told untruths for so long that they end up believing them to be fact. Having known a Spiritualist acquaintance   it was clear that she not only believed the weird things she was saying but would have liked to convert us to her way of thinking. This can often happen after the loss of a loved one, as with this lady,  when focusing on them constantly can play on the mind. People are particularly suggestible at such a time as they long for continued contact and clutch at straws.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	To scared people who are weak minded and need a crutch to get through life.

All of them real.|`|urIm4YaBaa	No. Reality is the way it is without regard to believing or disbelieving. Belief is not a sufficient or necessary cause for anything.    On the morning of February 20, 2008, I believed that my wife would give birth to a girl in a month. Before lunch, I was sitting in a hospital, holding onto a tearful wife, as we had just discovered that our daughter, who had been kicking the day before, had died in utero. Reality did not conform to my (or my wife's) belief; I was wrong. The fetal heartbeat monitor was silent, an ultrasound could not find any activity, and my wife's body was showing the signs of pre-eclampsia. That sort of evidence was more than sufficient to accept that my belief was wrong. No amount of faith could have changed the outcome.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	Unless it is something about me (I'm hungry), the answer is of course not.

It is guided by intent, meaning our intentions need to be of pure heart and mind.|`|eVBUkO7aaa	That depends on exactly what it is.|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	No. Just because a person beilves that all intricate lifeforms sprung from a one celled organism that was laying in the muck doesnt make it true.    Because if that were true where did that one cell come from? Where did the muck come from?    There is intelligent design in all of Jehovah God creations and that is why modern day man tries to mimic things in nature like the bumble bee and the helicopter, velcro and those annoying stickers that stick in your socks    But if you beilve inthe bible and study it and compare it to history you will see that it is really easy to gain faith    The apostle Paul spoke of certain religious people of his day who had "a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge." (Romans 10:2)    Accurate knowledge.It takes effort to study the bible, effort and time things that people dont really have or want nowadays.

Of course it is just as likely to be true.    Hope that helps.|`|PWankIUpaa	Belief in God through His Only Begotten Son Jesus is a belief which will stand whether YOU believe in Him or Not!

The Dalai Lama is amongst the many Lamas that are lineage holders. Also, the Dalai Lama is resigning from his political position in order just to be a Lama, saying Tibet will never be returned to the Tibetan people. A new minister is being appointed to the temporal leader spot.     Also, even saying that he is the spiritual leader of Tibetans or Tibetan Buddhists is an inaccurate statement to begin with as there are many who have never received teachings or empowerments from him, in which case he is not these people's Lama. Who people choose as their root Guru is a private and personal matter, and there are many people who have taken Lamas other than him as their teacher. It is important to bare this in mind because there is alot of misunderstanding and nonsense amongst the international Buddhist community. The Dalai Lama is not the Pope of Buddhism. He does wonderful work to benefit others, but people need to understand this stuff more clearly.     People are always asking 'who's your root Guru?' They try to get alot of personal info on you and then make all sorts of lofty uninformed comments they think are correct. There's alot of this uninformed comment making that happens made by people who don't really know what they're talking about, especially when posting on yahoo chat. Beware of all the answers you get here. Do some research to confirm, because I've read many many answers about Buddhist teachings on yahoo that are simply not correct.

I was the littlest one there, so I got the fun jobs... and I really didn't have to work too hard.. there were plenty of the bigger boys handy and the bigger girls took care of the house mostly.....

I did get to gather eggs a lot.... I never did mind getting pecked!... fresh milk... oh, wow!....     there was also a spring house.... when the heat was too much, I'd slip off to the spring house, where a mountain spring filled a deep brick-and stone lined hole in the ground, with shelves all around , in a dugout cave in the side of a hill, with adoor on it.... there was the coolest spot in the area!... better than today's air conditioning, cuz there was the smell of churned butter, stored potaotes and apples, and I ate my share!....    then the smoke house!!.. yum!!... hams in there 'workin'.... salt pork, salted beef and jerky... got to sample a good bit there, too!...    there was the berry patches across the road.... the creek down in the holler... and there was this one patch of green stuff out behind the barn that Pappy would bust our butts for getting into... didn't figger that out for many years.... but did, after I realized why he was so much fun after dinner and his pipe!...

Work starts often before daylight and is over at dusk.  We raised cows, hogs, and chickens for our food and a vegetable "truck" garden for canning and had seasonal vegetable gardens as well.  All those animals and gardens have to be fed and tended.  My Daddy was also a cotton farmer and he and my brothers were often in the fields all day.  The money was either good on lucky years or bad when the weather had been against us and the crops were meager.  You watch the weather....a lot.  A hail storm can wipe you out.  Drought can do the same.  Later we started using irrigation and that was even more work.  But we were well fed and healthy.  It's a different way of life and not for many.  Unfortunately it has become so expensive to farm that a lot of the younger generations just can't make it.  I am proud of my family and how we were raised.  I have never been ashamed that we lived off the land.  God taught us that we had to work if we expected to eat.  It was a good lesson to learn.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I grew up with horses and cattle. it was an heard life, working all the time but we were free.

Go in to make breakfast, then milk the goats, gather the eggs when it's light enough out, clean up in the house, muck the stalls, sometimes check fences, etc.  In the summer there's the gardening and canning (lots of it).  My husband also hunts and we have some of our animals butchered in town every fall.  It's rough, but there's nothing like a fresh angel food cake made with duck eggs with fresh-picked strawberry sauce on top :-)|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	I was raised on the farm , we grew and canned all of our vegetable had our beef cows, milk cows, pigs & chickens, We would get up and do our chores then played in the creek ,  at night we would all gather together for supper after wards, we would sit around and talk mom & daddy would tell about the good old days,=========edit, i was thinking of your question about living on the farm, i gave you some the good things, but I just remembered the time I really didn't  like it was when My Dad & brothers would do the buthering of the Beef cow ands hog, they would work all day mom would be equally busy makening rendering the lard and making chitlings (sp) or pork rinds, I would hate that time those animals I fed all year long,  I usually made myself  scarce during that time, I know the meat really taste good later, but I just didn't like the process of getting it. Luckily I was next to the yopungest and they sort  of look over me. ( The thing I remember after the buthering my parents would send our neighbors a fresh cut of meat , I think that was nice, I wonder if people would do that today.)|`|FGCjgc8Raa	Nothing else comes close to comparing with it.  I am so great full for having that privilege and advantage I lived on the farm from age eight until I married at age 18.  Then I lived back on a farm with my husband after a rude awakening living in Los Angeles for two years.  What an eye opening experience that was for a couple of country bumpkins lol.|`|89d8b42fd2f09137ee437b1d438fa9a8aa	I used to spend my summers on my uncle's farm as a child (ages 9-12)  I'd get up at dawn, pull 4 rows of weeds out of the soybean fields before breakfast. Then I'd make sure the cows were 'watered'. Then I'd whitewash fence for hours. Lunchtime ... then I'd feed the pigs or walk behind my uncle as he cultivated. It was my job to pull the dirt clods off of the small corn plants. Then I'd probably go to town w/ my uncle. Late afternoon meant more rows of weed pulling and checking the electric fence for continuity. We didn't have any free time until after dinner. Then, for a treat, we'd go to Bill and Maurices for some evening chess or horseshoes.  Eventually, I learned to drive the tractor ... oh yes, hours on the riding lawnmower (fun)  Once a summer we would get a day off and go to Lake Bontricia.  We took showers under the hose and used an outhouse.  Eventually I was trusted w/ a .22 to hunt groundhogs eating the crops.  I fattened a pig for slaughter and cried when they put a bullet in it's head. But, it was the best meat I've ever eaten ... it was a whole new flavor than what you get f/ a store.  I used to write letters to Mom begging to come home but cried when I had to leave ... pretty weird ... huh|`|b3h0ovgRaa	We spent summer week-ends "down" on the farm with our cousins. After tobacco season we would spend a week before school started. I loved it, I was a city girl and everything on the farm was so different. We swam in the creek, walked acre after acre through the woods and one summer we built a two story tree house not too far from the corn field. We had water melons and apples and pears from my cousins trees.(Of course the melons didn't grow on trees)  They didn't have indoor plumbing and I was scared of the 'outhouse' at night. Those were wonderful summers.    Poppy
AyEkA6Flaa	This could be tricky.    An all boys school *could* be really homophobic for that very reason, because lots of boys think they have to prove how masculine they are.    On the other hand, if it is a school heavily into the arts, it would not draw homophobic guys as students.    When I was in university I was in an all-guys dorm which was pure bliss -- seriously 25% of the guys on my floor were experimenting with other guys.  BUT, the environment was that there were also co-ed dorms, so that meant the guys who were in the all-guys dorm *wanted* to be there.    Is there a way you can talk to a present or past student who does not know you, so you can dig up whether it is gay-friendly or homophobic?|`|eVt0qkT8aa	Well, I have never heard of Co-Ed ( probably did somewhere ), but there might be a slim chance that you might not be the only gay guy there. Other boys there could be in the closet as well, but I wouldn't recommend going to an all-boys school. I suggest choosing your other choice for high school, since girls would seem to be more open-minded than the people at an all-boys school. There might be open-minded people there, too, but again, there's a slim chance, so I suggest going to an Co-Ed school since you're not out and unsure.|`|SWzTydgXaa	Socially?  Hard.  I knew a gay guy in the same position.  He went, but it was hard.  Do not come out.  You will be mocked, and you will be only known as "the gay kid."  Still, Me F. is sorta right.  School is about getting an education.  If it is a good school, than look into.

Err you'd fit in, you're a guy after all. ;-)|`|sgRJRuvgaa	go with Co-Ed  It's hard enough being in a locker room changing with a bunch of guys let alone being a school of all guys in which eventually there would be a locker room if Gym is required. BTW you could never come out cuz at that instant none of your class mates would like you because a lot of straight guys think if your gay your gonna rape them. It's stupid but so true|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Why? I think co-ed is better. More educational and diverse. Still problems though. Co-Ed provides more relationships and friends. It is partisan as everything is lop-sided, but bipartisan (co-ed) is all even and balancing. Not as many problems.|`|ohOANFjFaa	I went to an all boys high school.  While I was there a guy came out of the closet to a couple of his friends.  Word got around, and long story short, he had to transfer because he was harassed to the point that even his friends didn't want to hang out with him.  Guys at that age are trying to prove their manhood.  They get very defensive about going to a school with no females.  It's not right, but it's the way it is.  I would go elsewhere.|`|OI7eeIreaa	Chickenhawk in the henhouse.|`|rI6xYwhcaa	if you play your cards right, you'll fit just perfectly with the boys.    But seriously,  School is about work , less about social life. make afew close friends and keep it at that.|`|WxlwpEDbaa	You'd fit in very well I'd imagine. Go for it. Yum.|`|fFmbBRbcaa	personally i would have died at an all boys high school its meant to keep you from being distracted which totally isn't going to work because your gay... however you should be looking more into what benefits the high school gives you not just the sex of the people attending it|`|3ee9a82552425841f1df0a2f7477f624aa	I depends on you, if its a all boys one and there are no other gays out and they end up to be all homophobic then that could be a problem, but girls are more likely to be open to the idea of you be gay.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	I went to an all boys school by choice, and had very few problems.  You won't be the only gay there, and you may well meet up with others.  Wherever you go will be difficult at times, but you should be fine in a single sex school.  Hope this helps

She told me I would have to choose between him and her.  Later when he faked is own death after people were looking to kill him for his involvement in a nursing home scam - he contacted me to help him recover the 800K that he conned his partners out of.  Anyways, Helen got so mad that I helped him, that she left me. And I even proposed to her! Right in front of the Flightline Motel and she said no!      The point of this is to say that you should just be honest and tell them that you aren't interested.

0yPfYLEFaa	You have to choose whether you believe that God created the world through the big bang and evolution, or whether the first two chapters of Genesis are to be interpreted literally. One of those is destined to offend some, but what's important is what YOU believe on the subject and what YOU want to convey to others about how the world came into being.     If you believe God used evolution, you are not alone. And being Catholic, you have an advantage over those Christians who never read the Bible figuratively. If you believe that the account is literal, you must present it as such, but be aware that either way, you will offend some people. It's part of having an intelligent discussion.    You might preface your speech with a little something on how you don't want to offend anyone, but you do find the topic of the origins of the world very interesting and believe it happened the way you will set forth in your speech.|`|aV3bFchtaa	The catholics have decided that portions of the Bible are fallible, and those portions include the creation section found in Genesis.

Wouldn't the same thing happen?  Allah couldn't have done anything different, could he?  Really, I don't know Allah, but I don't think he could have done any better than what was done.  Let's forget about who did it and look at how it was done.  We have before us an elemental table.  The least element on that table is hydrogen.  That's an example we can look at.  But, actually, there is a better example, but it's not something that you can look at for any length of time.  And yes, I'm talking about the sun.  Do you know what the sun is made of?

You might talk about that.  It's a fairly recent development, but is supported by the current Pope, and many other important Catholics.  If science is in conflict with the Bible, a good Catholic is supposed to go with the science (while keeping in mind that all scientific truths are contingent on observation and experiment).    The Big Bang theory has a *lot* of supporting observational evidence, much of it provided by believing Catholics (and even priests---the original Big Bang model was developed by a priest).    "Though faith is above reason, there can never be any real discrepancy between faith and reason. Since the same God who reveals mysteries and infuses faith has bestowed the light of reason on the human mind, God cannot deny himself, nor can truth ever contradict truth" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 159).     "The question about the origins of the world and of man has been the object of many scientific studies which have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos, the development of life-forms and the appearance of man. These discoveries invite us to even greater admiration for the greatness of the Creator, prompting us to give him thanks for all his works and for the understanding and wisdom he gives to scholars and researchers" (CCC 283).|`|1iWNBBMfaa	I don't usually react this strong but: what kind of Taliban thinking has gone into your teacher that he makes you believe you must do anything to avoid being offensive?    I would think that if someones faith has only minimum power it would be able to withstand some pupil talking about a very normal subject that has some connections to religious views.|`|89MKzLl3aa	Your teacher does have a point. Will there be visitors from outside your school who may have a right to be offended?    Yes, God created the universe. But, to avoid drama, I would choose a "safe" topic. How does the universe inspire you? What in nature inspires you? Something like that.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Just tell it the way it is, and if you offend some people that's too bad.      Frankly, whether you believe in God or not, the tendency among many religious people to stick their heads in the sand and ignore scientific knowledge whenever it seems contradictory with the Bible should offend you.  No, they don't just ignore it, they LIE and they OBSTRUCT the course of true knowledge by having real science BANNED from the classrooms and the text books.    Stand up and spread the truth - maybe this is how God did it - maybe this is just how it happened, but this is HOW IT HAPPENED.    Good luck.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	1. Most important of all subjects: "WHO IS GOD?"      We all talk about Him, certainly we love Him and we bear witness that He is the Greatest. We live in His Universe. There is nothing to compare with it, so there is nothing to compare with Him. But Who is He? We want to know our Creator, we want to know God. The Bible teaches us that God made man in His own image and His own likeness. It teaches us that He breathes, sorrows, sees and hears, loves and hates.    Honorable Elijah Muhammad through honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan taught us how this process began which took place in the darkness itselfin the dark womb of space where God was in the process of his Own Self-Creation. He was atom itself, spinning and evolving in this darkness of space and orbs of consciousness. He alone defined what and who we are from the explosion of the first atom of thought. Therefore, his make corresponds to the dark matter or material of darkness out of which he produced himself to become mathematically the number one. Thats how human beings came into existence and everthing universe. Our own beginning bears witness to the beginning of the Universe. The very secret of how the Universe began is wrapped up in how you and I began.     We don't know the Universe, because we don't know God, because you don't know ourself.  Look at the sperm. There is intelligence in the sperm; it knows exactly what it want to do: it goes straight for the egg; that is intelligence.     The sperm does not have a brain, but it has a head and a tail.  When the sperm makes contact, it's the first cell of life. That cell starts looking for a firm resting place, then it builds a clot.  There is intelligence in that clot. Then the cells produce brain. That's the first thing formed in the new life.     Without a head, you don't need arms. The thing that is going to direct the arms has to be first.   It is the head that calls the arms and feet into existence.  Thats why woman is the key to Kingdom of Heaven and Earth or  Very Supreme Advance civilization will be establish on Earth and Universe, She is First Act of Creation because she carries life in her womb barewitness of GOD SELF CREATION FIRST or CREATED HIMSELF FIRST out wombs space.     U might say Why is God a "he"?  Why can't God be "she"?  The woman is made after the womb out of which God created Himself, and in the woman is the Secret of God, She is SECOND SELF GOD.    There cannot be a new world except that there is a new and better understanding of the female, which will give us (men) a clearer understanding of self and above all, a clearer understanding of  (God). In the Bible, (God) declares, Behold I make all things new.It is only through her that we live again, and again, and again. It is only through her that we continue to move toward the true perfection that  (God) desires for His creation. She is the cornerstone of the family and therefore is critical in the whole process of nation and world building.    Since, the womb of our mother is sacred, then, this teaches us that the womb of every female is also sacred, for it is from her womb that all the Scientists, Prophets, Sages, Messengers, Kings, Rulers and Gods have come and will come    This Universe is material, but the essence of the Universe is spiritual. The core of the Sun is not fire; the core of the Sun is the thought projected by the Will of God which forms the Sun. When you look at the Sun and are warmed by the Sun; that is a blessing. But to understand why God made Sun, you have to go into the Mind of God, for His Mind is at the core of what He created. But if you do not pierce the veil of the physical, you will never find the essence.|`|UBYu08bOaa	Why the hell would you do a speech on that?

By "pre-warning" you that an answer which is different from catholic teachings may "offend" others, your teacher has already intimidated you in your answer to a question which is clearly scientific as well as religious. This type of "coaching" by your teacher is what people like me find very offensive.

In this day and age, as the Bible has foretold, "Offenses must needs come".  This means people will be offended easily.  It also says that things that are good will be called bad, and things that are bad will be called good.     As a person of faith, you shouldn't have to hide the Truth, but be wise and know when  things become pointless and you don't need any longer to waste your breath.     I'm surprised that your school, a Catholic School nonetheless, is more concerned about offending others than offending God.     People who are offended by the word "God" are quick to invoke their rights and criticisms.  That doesn't mean you have to stay silent yourself because you have those same rights as well.    However, someone did  make a point in you being able to supply the right information to support your statement.  If you need a little help with your topic, I suggest the site below.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	Your teacher is being unduly defensive.  A good Catholic will have far fewer problems reconciling the Church's teaching with the best of modern science than a Protestant creationist.      Why not say that no-one knows why the universe should exist - which is true, irrespective of what religious or other beliefs one may hold - but that science can explain a great deal about how it functions as it does.  Then say that as a believer you see God's power at work throughout the whole of creation, and develop that idea.  NEVER think that faith and science have to be in conflict: they are different forms of response to the wonder of existence and complement rather tha contradict each other.|`|LqetdhxBaa	You should note several things:  1). The catholic church has the same bible as us protestants but include the apocrytha ie wisdom, sirach, etc  2). The catholic church is generally discouraged from reading the bible as it reveals the faults in the catholic church  3). During the Dark Ages, the Catholic church use to burn people alive for having a bible.    Therefore, I do not think the student will find any offence as Catholics generally believe the same stuff as us Protestants but differ in the doctrinal sense...sharply.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Consult the Catechism of The Catholic Church about this.  If you are in a Catholic school at a grade level that makes your speech appropriate, the school should definitely have a copy of The Catholic Catechism available.  Also try to read a great book written by Thomas Dubay, entitled   The Evidential Power of Beauty, Science and Theology Meet.   Thomas Dubay is a very scholarly Catholic priest.    Keep in mind that God can be considered the cause of the Universe even within various "big bang" theories.    Your teacher's warning to you that you might offend others is interesting to me.  I hope that you follow that warning by being respectful of others,  and not by holding back relevant information.    Lots of people accuse the Catholic Church of being anti-science.  That accusation is pretty close to baseless.  The common "evidence" that people give to "prove" that the Church is anti-science is the Church's dealings with Galileo.   The Church's position against some of Galileo's teachings were the result of Galileo teaching some things that he had not yet scientifically proven.   Galileo was mostly correct,  but he was in fact wrong about some things.   The Church takes a very conservative approach to making scientific claims that are not fully proven when the claims in question could be taken to contradict Church doctrine.    Lots of people don't know that Copernicus was a Catholic priest.  It would be nice if you could include his very important astronomical findings in your presentation.    Given your choice of speech topics, I think you would find Thomas Dubay's book a genuine delight to read.  If your school does not have a copy, e-mail me and I will make sure your school gets a copy fast.   I'm not wealthy by any means, but in this case, I'll make sure you get access to this book.    Never accept anyone's accusation that Roman Catholicism and honest Science are not compatible.   Catholic Universities have educated many thousands of serious scientists throughout the centuries.  Many serious scientists are in fact Catholic priests who belong to the order of The Society of Jesus.  They are commonly called "Jesuits".  Not all Jesuits are scientists,  but many are.  Catholicism and Science are very compatible.    Good luck with your speech presentation.   I recommend that you learn your topic well, and use only relatively brief notes during your presentation.   try not to merely read your presentation, but look at your audience and speak courteously to them.    I'm serious about making sure your school has the book I mentioned.  If necessary, e-mail me and I will make sure the school obtains a copy fast.    You show true courage in your selection of a speech topic.  Prepare well, and speak with confidence and courtesy.  Peace be with you.      EDIT:  Someone else said that The Catholic Church considers parts of The Bible to be fallible.  The Church does not consider The Bible to be fallible,  but the Church does not consider the Bible to be a simple Science text book  or journal of plain History. The Church views parts of the Bible to be allegorical stories.  Such stories were not written to be read literally,  but the main story can still be true.  The main creation story in Genesis is that God created everything.   The Catholic Church considers that to be true.|`|eGBVFU2Gaa	Write it from the heart and don't worry about offending anyone.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Read about Galileo's experience with the Catholic Church, for inspiration.    http://members.cox.net/deleyd/religion/g...    The truth of the matter is no-one knows quite how the universe was created, and from where.  It could well be part of an infinite cycle of 'big bangs' (ironically first proposed by Priest, Georges Le Maitre) originating from an infinite 'multiverse', or from time and space and physics beyond our knowledge or reckoning.    Whatever, if people are threatened by hypothesis or theory based upon evidence, then what does that say about their honesty?|`|pxgIsS0Maa	Ask your teacher if a speech on how life evolved over millions of years, would be offensive.

Nothing else would have the mind and power to create the universe.  Virtually everyone agrees that the universe came into existence at the Big Bang around 15 billion years ago. The Bible only says the earth & universe are very old; so the age of the universe should not be a problem.  Something that comes into being (such as the universe) is an effect that has to have a cause. Self-creation is impossible because something cannot do anything before it exists. Something cannot come out of absolute nothingness, so there has to be a first cause that has always existed or nothing would exist. The only answer for the existence of the universe is God.|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	Here are a couple of things I like. In the Bible, you would know this one: Gen 1:1 "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." Also,  Isaiah 40:22 says, "God sits above the circle of the earth."  This was all written thousand of years before humans knew the shape of the earth. I think some of the Psalms talk about God's creation and His care of the earth and it's creation. Lastly, some people say the earth began with the Big Bang, as if that happened somehow without God. But, I like to think of it this way -- God said "Let there be light." like the Bible says, and BANG it happened. If you choose the God-created-the-earth argument, expect some not to like it, but that shouldn't stop you from saying what you think. If the Catholic school doesn't hold tight to God, they will lose Him.
3EudCWEuaa	Hello,    Great question! First of all, you have to consider something:    You said other religions came and went away. If you believe in God, then your world view is that God is the beginning of all, and it was the original religion. Other religions came from others who rejected God over time.    So theologically speaking, God is the only religion, and all others have been worshiping a false god.    So what you are doing is assuming that chrisitanity/judaism was a false made up thing to start with. I don't believe that. I believe they are based on truth.    But by using your same logic I could actually flip this question around. I could say, "If the Judeo-Christian (and muslim) God is false, why has he survived all this time??    Good question, huh? Because if it was fake, then it would have disappeared with those who worshipped Zeus, Baal, etc. Yet it thrives even today.    Also, why does everyone have a belief in God anyways (I am talking every culture). It is possible that each belief in God has a grain of truth? Just like a worldwide flood story. Is it possible they all come from truth?|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	It's all mumbo-jumbo to me.|`|i6d582PFaa	The truth is older than time.

When you say, "now they are gone" however, who are "they"? The Jews have been around for thousands of years, worshiping the God of Abraham and Moses.  I'm worshiping that same God.  We as Christians believe that is the same God that the first two humans in existence knew face to face.  We believe that we have encountered the God that created all things and has revealed himself to generation after generation. Is there any good reason I should stop believing? Or just that there are other religions that have shown themselves to not stand the test of time that mine has?|`|0aN1xIxfaa	Yes, they have gone. But gone where?  The real God is the one who created us. The real religion is not the one with greatest claim to antiquity, or greatest numbers of adherents, or evidence of the most powerful miracles. Real religion is worship of the Creator. It was this Creator who didn't ask us to swear with our lives, but who gave His own life - for us - that we might live eternally, set free from guilt and shame because He paid the price of our sin. That is why Christianity is different to every other religion. It is the only one where God came down in order to lift man up.|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	The south fought and died to preserve a way of life that included slavery. Those people felt strongly that slavery was legitimate. Yet any reasonable human knows that slavery is wrong.           During WWII the allies fought and died to stop nations (Germany, Italy and Japan) from claiming territory and from spreading their elitist, manifest destiny ideals. The people who fought against these ideals felt strongly about them too.          These are two examples show that people can die for their beliefs no matter what they are. Fighting and dying for beliefs does not make those beliefs right. Nor does it mean that all who feel strongly about what they believe should be viewed equally. What should be considered is WHAT they believe and WHY they believe it. Not that they believed it first (as you seem to suggest).            Your argument means nothing.|`|H1jCEklPaa	take heed that no man deceive you.For many shall come in my name,saying I am christ;and shall deceive many.and you sall hear of wars and rumor of wars:see that ye be not troubled:all these things must come to pass,but the end is not yet.for nation shall rise up against nation,and kingdom against kingdom:and there shall be famines,and pestilences,and earthquakes,in divers places. all these are the beginning of sorrow: that is in mathew 24 . john 10 Verliy Verliy, i say unto you ,He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a theif and a robber.But he that entereth in by the the door is the sheperd of the sheep.To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,and the sheep follow him:for they know his voice.And a stranger will they not follow,but will flee from him:for they know not the voice of strangers. the bible says let Gods word be true and every man a lair.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	"How can you say that your God is real, when other religions older than Christianity have come and gone? "    I think it's remarkable how there have been so many religions that have come and gone, but Jesus Christ split the measurement in time in half.    This is a quote I like,     "We look back upon history and what do we see? Empires rising and falling, revolutions and counter-revolutions, wealth accumulated and wealth dispersed. Shakespeare has spoken of the rise of great ones that ebb and flow with the moon.    I look back upon my own fellow countrymen, once upon a time dominating a quarter of the world, most of them convinced in the words of what is still a popular song, that the God who made them mighty will make them mightier yet. Ive heard a crazed cracked Austrian that announced to the world a reich that would last a thousand years.  Ive seen an Italian clown that said he was going to stop and restart the calendar with his own ascension to power. I met a murderous Georgian brigand in the Kremlin, proclaimed by the intellectual elite of the world as wiser than Solomon, more humane than Marcus Aureleus, more enlightened than the Shoka.    I have seen America wealthier, and in terms of military weaponry more powerful than the rest of the world put together, so had the American people so desired, they could have outdone a Caesar or an Alexander in the range and scale of their conquest.  All in one lifetime! All in one lifetime! Gone! Gone with the wind. England part of a tiny island off the coast of Europe threatened with dismemberment and even bankruptcy.    Hitler and Mussolini dead and remembered only in infamy. Stalin a forbidden name in the regime he helped found and dominated for some three decades. America haunted by fears of running out of those precious fluids that keeps her motorways running and the smog settling. With troubled memories, and painful memories, of a disasterous campaign in Vietnam, and the victory of the Don Quixotes of the media as they charged the windmills of Watergate.    All in one lifetime! All in one lifetime! Gone! Gone with the wind.     Behind the debris of these solemn supermen and self-styled Imperial diplomatists stands the gigantic figure of one person because of whom, by whom, in whom, and through whom alone mankind may still have hope. The person of Jesus Christ. The more I look at the saviors of men, the more beautiful the Lamb of God looks to me. "    --Malcolm Muggeridge, former BBC anchor|`|AA10043552	Fundies need to believe their religion is the only true one. It keeps them from having to think.

The ancient Greeks refused the concept of negative numbers, and were known to kill people who tried to support such a belief.  The Mayans were the only pre-middle ages society to come up with the concept of zero.  So that must mean that, since they have wrong ideas about math, that it does not exist.    Christianity teaches that God has always been trying to reveal himself to people throughout all of history.  They Bible talks about several convenants that God set up with people besides Jews (such as Noah and Job).  So the idea that there have been many religions supports the idea of God.  Where has ever culture gotten the concept if there is not God?    If you read through the Bible, you will find that God revealed himself step by step to the people in it.  Noah's religion had him build a boat, but knew nothing about the idea of circumcision.  That would come later.  Abraham learned how to make a covenant with God through circumcision, but knew nothing about the 10 commandments or other laws.  Moses was given 614 laws for the Jewish people, but knew nothing about Temple service and praise.  David learned about the power of praise and prayer, but not the Suffering Servant (Jesus).  That would come with Isaiah.    So the idea that there have been many religion along the way does not disprove the existence of God.  Rather Christianity is unique in that it is the only religion with a progressive revelation by dozens of authors over a 1500+ year period. It builds on the religious revelation that came before it, much as modern math builds on all the concepts that led up to it.        Hopefully you also realize that all those earlier religions are not gone.  Hunduism, Zaoism, and many others are still practiced today.  In fact during the recent Olypics in Greek there were people upset because during that him they were not able to access the ancient temples and continue thier worship services for Zeus and the other gods.|`|5HbQ6Pwiaa	From your Vantage point in hell you will be-able to see the christians being pampered by God in their heavenly mansions but you will be stuck there for ever with all the evil that has ever been..

Christianity has been around since the creation - not known as "christianity" of course until after the death of Christ - who we KNOW historically to be a real person too.  But FAITH of a Christian is based on what they have come to know, feel, believe, realize, recognize and feel validated by the spirit of God in their own HEARTS, minds, and souls.  THAT is where proof exists for a real Christian.  That is the heart of FAITH in general.    FAITH in GOd, in Jesus CHrist does not require that I prove ANYTHING to you - it is enough and sufficient that I have sought and obtained personal witness & proof within ME, FOR me.      Even if every living Christians faith was one day found to be WRONG when we leave this life and this world at our own DEATHS - we have become better, stronger, more pure, more loving, more refined a PERSON because of this FAITH & BELIEF.  Any non-believing, pessimistic, faithless person has missed out on these benefits & the effects of living with such FAITH.  We all find & choose the things that WE know to be true TO US and that should be enough.|`|ncXMA6rsaa	It's pretty short sighted, isn't it.|`|AA12070800	I don't say "my" God is real, I say God is real.  Is that the same God of the Zoroastrians? Which by the way is still around.  To me the important thing is to ask what it is in humanity that has always sought the spiritual, sought something beyond human experience, named something as divine.  There are many religious folks who affirm God but do not need to insist their religion is the "correct" one.  "many streams, one river" and many paths up the same mountain are two ways to understand various religions.|`|AA11923447	I feel that my religion is right for me. However, I don't go around proclaiming that my belief system is the only way. I feel that God is real; however, I do not have empirical evidence either proving or disproving the existence of God. I can believe certain things to be so, but I'm not going to go around telling others that they must share my beliefs.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	I guess we'll see. Let's take Zues for an example, the religion to me was pointless. It didn't tell of anything to come. Christianity has many predictions of the future, and well some people say they are coming true.

A lot of people will simply tell you that no one knows the answer, and that you have to pray to God for an answer. Though I'm sure people have prayed about it before and died before getting an answer...otherwise I'm sure this would have been answered already (though I could just be unaware of any books out there that addressed this question...I'm not exactly an up-to-date person).    The only reason I can think of right now...is that if we don't have faith in God, we don't deserve eternal bliss with a deity we didn't believe in in the first place, and thus are sent to the only other alternative. But that doesn't explain why hell is such a horrible place- or such an eternal place for that matter, and why there isn't some kind of 3rd option like purgatory or something|`|YUjVFkocaa	Our God loves us, but the simple fact that he is pure and good makes him unable to live in the same place (heaven) as us.    In other words.... he doesn't WANT to hurt us or send us to hell.  But if we didn't accept Jesus Christ as our savior (which cancels out all sin), we would inherently have committed SOME sins.  Even thinking negative thoughts is a sin, for example.    And the fact that we have impurities and sin, however small, means that if we were in the same place as God, we would burn up because he is so righteous and good and pure, and us having evil in us, we couldn't bear to be in the same place.  We would inevitably burn in HEAVEN too- just for the simple fact that evil cannot be in the same place as pure, almighty, sinless, good God!  So he might as well have made a place for us to burn in peace, instead of having to gaze at all the "believers" NOT burning.  At least in Hell, the damned have company.  It still sucks... but at LEAST you have others to share the horrible experience with.    =====================    As for abortion, I would rather have rare and legal than common and illegal.    But, I am not just a Christian, I am also intelligent, and I understand the way the world works, and has worked, for thousands of years.  And the way things work is this:    If abortion was made legal, there would be MORE of them!      The thought-process for doing something that grants self-gratification (and abortion) is as follows:    1) do I want to do it? The answer is "yes" for both.  2) Is it worth me to do it? Is it legal? will i get in trouble?     The answer is "no" x3 for number 2, if abortion is illegal!!!! Which means everybody except a few idiots will obey the law.      HOWEVER, if abortion is legal, people will less often be morally opposed to it; they will not care as much, as they will not get in trouble; and they will not be worried about breaking the law.    ====================    This line of logic follows everything in the books!!! If rape was legal, how many sexually horny (but uncool or ugly) guys would end up raping a girl?  MANY MORE!  The reason is because the benefits outweigh the risks, if it is legal!  But if it is illegal, the risks outweigh the benefits, so only idiots rape girls in todays society!    How many people would steal, if it were legal? MOST EVERYBODY!    How many people would beat people up if they get angry, if it were legal? MOST EVERYBODY THAT WAS PHYSICALLY STRONGER THAN THE VICTIM!    How many people would cheat in school, if it were legal? MANY MORE THAN THE   OF STUDENTS WHO DO NOW!|`|AA12245463	Central to the Jewish response to suffering is a staunch rejection of the belief in its redemptive power.  According to Judaism there are no ennobling qualities in pain.  The belief in the redemptive quality of suffering is a profoundly Christian concept.  In Christianity, the suffering servant, the crucified Christ, brings atonement for the sins of mankind through his own sacrifice and torment.  The message:  Without suffering there can be no redemption.  According to Christianity, if Jesus had not suffered and died on the cross, mankind would still be damned.  Suffering is therefore extolled in the New Testament: And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces hope (Rom. 5:3-4).  If we are being afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation; if we are being consoled, it is for your consolation, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are also suffering (2 Cor. 1:6).  Indeed, Paul even made suffering an obligation, encouraging the fledging Christians to share in suffering like a good soldier of Christ Jesus (2 Tim. 2:3).  In Judaism, however, suffering is anything  but redemptive.  It leads to a tortured spirit and a pessimistic outlook on life.  It scars our psyches and brings about a cynical consciousness, devoid of hope.  Suffering causes us to dig out the insincerity of the hearts of our fellows and to be envious of other peoples happiness. If individuals do become better people as a result of their suffering, it is despite the fact that they suffered, not because of it.  Ennoblement of character comes through triumph over suffering, rather than its endurance.  Mans mission was never to make peace with suffering and death, but to abolish them from the face of the earth for all eternity by joining God as a junior partner in creation.  By studying medicine and offering aid to people in need, we live up to our highest calling of having been created in the divine image.  The atheist doctor who struggles to cure AIDS is infinitely more in tune with the Jewish response to suffering than the minister of religion who tells his flock that suffering is part of the divine plan.  The sinning businessman who may have never stepped into a synagogue but makes a loan to a colleague to save him from bankruptcy is more in tune with the Jewish response to suffering than the Rabbi who seeks to give a rationalization for why children die of leukemia.  Our role as humans is not to give meaning to aberrations, but combating them and to healing wounds.    "Judaism for Everyone" by Rabbi Shmuley Boteach  .|`|UjlKVKRhaa	I dont know about the people you been talking to,but they are wrong. The Bible says that we cant earn our way into heaven. "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves,it is the gift of God--not by works,so that no one can boost."  (Ephesians 2:8&9) It also says that we should be doing the Lord's work. It is a combination of both faith & works. The only way to get into heaven is the ABC's of salvation: Admit that we have sinned, Believe that Jesus died & three days later arose from the grave & now sits @ the right hand of the Father & that he was sent to save us from our sins,Confess our sins to God. Then we w/ God's help we can live the Life God has planned for us. As for the abortion part Rare but Legal.There some situations that warrant an abortion. We need to have a close, personal relationship w/ God. It takes a lot of work like any other relationship but it is well worth it!!! Real Christians Are NOT Obsessed w/ punishment!!!|`|eomrfXrzaa	They're masochists.  They think that the only way to achieve salvation is to be as guilty and penitent as possible, forsaking the potential of life to, in their mind, cleanse themselves of some imaginary taint.  It's a holdover from the middle ages when the priests held ultimate power by making people believe they were infected and the only way to be cured was to serve them utterly.|`|rYaqoPTHaa	People who are obsessed with anything aren't normal.

PZKmZ95Yaa	YES    YES    I think the fact that God specifically chose her to be the Mother of Jesus, the Mother of Our Hope, the Mother of Our Salvation, makes her something special.    Beginning in Luke 1:28, the angel Gabriel approaches Mary to announce the birth of Christ and greets her by saying "Hail, favored one! The Lord is with you."          Later in the gospel, in verse 42, Mary pays a visit to her cousin Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist.   The joy of Elizabeth as expressed to Mary, the mother of her Lord. "Most blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb."|`|ScmAk5EVaa	There is only one Jesus and I echo the Apostle  St. Thomas,"My Lord and my God"|`|wtg8vtzBaa	How would Elizabeth know Mary was the mother of God?  Don't we find that out after Jesus dies/rises?|`|wND7qPTWaa	Yes    God is our Father  And Mary is our mother|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Good explanation. Very good.|`|AA11690436	Considering your screen name, I'll just speak these words of wisdom,  Let it be.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	It is very good for those who have the work of grace begun in their souls, to communicate one to another. On Marys arrival, Elisabeth was conscious of the approach of her who was to be the mother of the great Redeemer. At the same time she was filled with the Holy Ghost, and under his influence declared that Mary and her expected child were most blessed and happy, as peculiarly honoured of and dear to the Most High God. Mary, animated by Elisabeths address, and being also under the influence of the Holy Ghost, broke out into joy, admiration, and gratitude. She knew herself to be a sinner who needed a Saviour, and that she could no otherwise rejoice in God than as interested in his salvation through the promised Messiah. Those who see their need of Christ, and are desirous of righteousness and life in him, he fills with good things, with the best things; and they are abundantly satisfied with the blessings he gives. He will satisfy the desires of the poor in spirit who long for spiritual blessings, while the self-sufficient shall be sent empty away.|`|f0dbf7bef8f4954ab34a161d799935c6aa	The catechisms actually DO warrant worship of Mary and is evident in the graven images of her that people kiss, pray to, and wail over. She was simply the human vessel of Jesus. As one other stated, this statement was no different than what Thomas said. Mary birthed Jesus. God consists of three equal parts that make One. Mary did not birth the Father, nor the Holy Spirit, she birthed the fleshly incarnation of the Word....Jesus Christ. She is not the mother of God, only a vessel that brought the fleshly embodiment of the Word in to the world. Jesus existed before time began. He is from everlasting to everlasting...and Mary can't stack up to that.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Does she mean, "Mother of my God"?    Well, naturally, that is debatable.  There is no indication in that passage one way or another.  She could mean "my God" or she could mean "my lord, the messiah".    Remember, "lord" is just a title.  True, it is THE title used to refer to God, but that is certainly not the only way that it is used in the New Testament.  Therefore, either interpretation is possible in this particular passage.  Which one of them is accurate is a subjective determination.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...

It is the laws of Judaism, given to the covenant nation, Israel, in the Torah, that determine Jewish identity.  It is not a matter of blood but of self-determination through the laws of the Jewish people.    The Jewish people are considered both a nation and a religion. Our connection is primarily one of faith (religion) through the covenant of Israel, yet membership is also conferred by birth, through matrilineal descent .One may also become a part of the nation Israel by adoption of the faith of Judaism and formal procedures of conversion.    One who converts to Judaism is considered as FULLY Jewish as one born Jewish and their children are Jews. This has been the case since the times of the Torah.    There is no ONE Jewish ethnicity, but a great many ethnicities that are distinctly Jewish. There are the Mizrahi (from the Middle East and North Africa).The Sephardi (Spanish) and the Ashkenazi, (German, Polish, Russian and other Eastern European)that are all slightly different, even within those three designations as to cultural practices and foods, but it is the faith and covenant that binds them all together as Klal Yisrael.     The Jewish nation began as a group of tribes and our connection to one another is still from the perspective of a tribal nation. (example:  as the Lakota nation has tribal procedure and law to determine who is a member of their tribe, who is not, who is expelled and who is adopted, so does Judaism)  One born a member of the tribal covenant nation Israel (Jewish) may not be observant or even believe in God and theyre still a full member, a Jew. They may not be a good member or an active member but theyve not renounced membership by following something ELSE instead of Judaism. An atheist or a secular Jew is not trying to call something ELSE Judaism. That is how one may be an "atheist Jew", they still may live Jewish ethics and identify with their people, but they did not take on foreign beliefs contradictory to monotheism or Torah  Now if one born into the covenant becomes apostate to it through rejection of the covenant by adoption of another belief contradictory to the covenant, they are still be considered a Jew, but for all intents and purposes, they're not given the status of a member. According to Jewish law they're not counted in a minyan,( the minimum number of adults required for certain prayers and other mitzvot), they can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery, they cannot be given honors to go up to read Torah at a synagogue, and they may not be allowed to speak for the Jewish people. They CAN however, return without formal conversion should they so desire and then be embraced again as full members. One who has left the Jewish people for the foreign faith of another people must undergo the steps of TESHUVAH , which means repentance and return to the God of Israel. Some groups may require that the individual also requires immersion in the mikveh before being accepted back, but they do not require the formal steps of conversion should the person wish to return.      Jews are in NO way a RACE..other than as members of the human race.     You can become a member of a tribe or nation if you meet the criteria of citizenship. And the covenant people, Klal Yisrael, remain as in the earliest days of the covenant..a nation. It hasn't changed.  It is against Jewish law for any Jew to discriminate against a convert to Judaism. Since the time of the Torah converts have been accepted as fully Jewish, and this is the case in all branches. We are not even supposed to refer to the fact that they are converts! It is up to them if they wish to identify themselves as such. They are Jews, period.    The covenant people, Israel have been MULTIRACIAL since the days of Torah, Moses' wife, Zipporah was a black woman. There have been Ethiopian Beta Yisrael since the days of Solomon! And I repeat, one cannot convert to a race. One may convert and become fully Jewish.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Jew is a race.

AA10311549	There can be no reasonable answer to your questions.  And it is answers like the following which I find almost totally meaningless:    1) "Neither obeyed the gospel of Christ:"  2) "None seem Reborn."  3)  "A human can give 1 million dollars to charity and still not go to heaven because he/she is not saved."    4) " In order to get rewards in heaven, it will be determined on how long the person has been a christian as well as how much faith and how much time he has put into christianity."    5)  "The things that you do on Earth, do not matter."    6)  'If they are both saved Christians, then they will be in heaven."  If they are not saved, they will be in hell",    What a bunch of garbage!    Some of these replies show an absolute lack of compassion, understanding of love, and a severe self-centerdness,      And the God these people espouse i want nothing to do with.    "God is love and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him."    There is nothing in that about mouthing the words:  "I have chosen Jesus as my personal savior" and all the other nonesense lines above.    TRUE FAITH is NOT in a purely cognative "belief."  True faith is found in the love engendered in one's life.    You say "works" do not "save" a person and that my be true, however, "by their fruits you shall know them."  (Read a bit of the epistle of James)  It is in a person's works that their TRUE faith is manifest. All the rest is irrelevant.      James 2: 17 - 26  Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.   Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.   Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.   But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?   Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?   Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?   And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.   Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.   Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?   For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.     All that stuff about "obeying the gospel" being "reborn" etc. is nonesense.  True Faith is found in the love in each person.s heart and how much they give of themselves to others.  True faith is NOT found in mouthing any words, true faith is not in filling some magic formula and thus you are "saved."  True faith is LIVING a life of love.      A true Christian is one following the Christ's message of loving one's neighbor as oneself. and you can mouth all the platitudes you want and proclaim your "faith" in Jesus all you want, but this means nothing unless without love.    1 Corinthians, 13: 1-8:   "If I speak in human and angelic tongues but do not have love, I am a resounding gong or a clashing cymbal.  And if I have the gift of prophecy and comprehend all mysteries and all knowledge; if I have all faith so as to move mountains but do not have love, I am nothing.  If I give away everything I own, and if I hand my body over so that I may boast but do not have love, I gain nothing.  Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous, (love) is not pompous, it is not inflated,  it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick-tempered, it does not brood over injury,  it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth.  It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails."    It does NOT require one to have even heard of Christ's name or scripture.but it DOES require to have faith in the love of God and have love in our lives.  These are the true christians, whether they call themselves Christians, Jews, Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, or even an atheist.    To assume that just because one is not a Christian or YOUR brand of Christian they will go to hell is the height of arrogance, pride, and ignorance.

The main problem is that such a strong emphasis has been put against it as a public taboo that it has gotten a reputation for being wrong or a sin to do at all (which it is not).    One of the few biblical references to masturbation has been used to scare children for millennia (into doing it in private).  Genesis 38:9 (38:1 thru 38:30 if you want the whole incest tale) tells the story of god killing a man because he refused to get his brother's widow pregnant.    There are however several real dangers in masturbations (not wrong, but be cautious).    Though some people believe being too lustful by itself is bad there is no direct link between that and "sin" or wrong. Unlike the uptight Christians, many cultures including the Jews celebrate sex when it is done between a husband and wife (even if it is for fun and not for procreation).    Targeting your lust on a real person can be a problem.    It can be de-humanizing to think of them as an object. This can also lead to an un-healthy or unrealistic obsession. Finally, it could, eventually, lead to an inability to have a relationship with a real man/woman.    If they belong to someone else (husband/wife BF/GF, what ever) that can be even worse. Coveting is wanting the exact thing someone else has.  You cannot have someone else's relationship! The best you can do is have one AS GOOD AS someone else's. (Even if you dated that same person, you will never have the exact same relationship they had with that other person).|`|9CHjZ8sBaa	The Bible does not condemn masturbation,     However , it is wrong with respect to the thoughts you may have while engaging in it.It may bring immorality and sexual deviancy  into the heart.|`|rhuDGMlzaa	I don't think masturbation is wrong, who hasn't done it.|`|NCRfZRopaa	Nothing.

According to the text, after God had killed Onan's older brother Er, Judah, his father, asked Onan to have sex with Tamar, Er's widow, so that the offspring could be declared Er's heir.  The narrative implies that Onan didn't object to the sex itself, but performed coitus interruptus, spilling his seed upon the ground, so that there wouldn't be any offspring which he could claim as his own.    Back in those days it was considered the brother's duty to get the wife pregnant and the child would be considered Er's and so take his inheritance and carry on the family line.  The fact he disobeyed God in this regard was what got him killed, not the fact that he chucked his muck onto the sand.    Incidentally, this is where the term onanism comes from.|`|pUIsx4Vsaa	Masturbation wastes creative energy. imo    However if our state of being is affected negatively by the power of our desires then maybe it is better to release that energy even inappropriately.

I was sent here to this world by my Heavenly Father to learn and grow, and bring glory to Him. Heavenly Father knew that I would sin and fail, so He sent His son Jesus to pay the price for my sins. Jesus Christ is my choicest and dearest friend. Jesus said that "if you love me, keep my commandments." I know that these commandments are for my protection, because He loves me. He gave me the freedom to choose what I do in my life, but He also gave me the commandments to guide and protect me if I follow them.    I know that through the restored Priesthood that I have a "life-line" to Heavenly Father and it will help me stay close to Him. The priesthood is the power for man to act in the name of God--it is held by all worthy men in our church, but actually, it is kind of synonymous with "fatherhood." That is maybe the biggest difference between our church and other Christian churches--we believe that we have the lineage of priesthood restored from the original apostles of Jesus Christ.    We also have the Book of Mormon, which is another testament of Jesus Christ. It really is a wonderful testimony of Jesus Christ's love for ALL people.    My church focuses on charity and fellowship for others, and that is why we become a part of it. So that we can support and strengthen one another. Something that I like to remember about God's people is that "there are no poor among them."     Well, there is a lot more, but this is the basic of what I believe. (I am not one of those to publish massive epistles on Y!A--who's going to read it?) But believe me, I love this church for what it has brought me to--which is a realization that I am a daughter of God and that I have a purpose in this life.|`|WyICbuPqaa	A Mormon is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.  They are neither Catholic nor Protestant, but have been established by revelation.    When the apostles of Christ were killed, the basic church organization established by Jesus ceased to exist.  One of the remnants of the church, went on to establish itself as the main church, claiming authority from Peter.  Revelations, miracles, and the gifts of the Holy Ghost had ceased; the doctrines of the new church were set by common vote, and thus it became known as the universal or "Catholic" church.  When several prominent Catholic priests noticed that it had strayed in both practice and belief from the Holy Scriptures, they attempted unsuccessfully to reform it.  This effort to reform resulted in the many protestant sects that exist today.    The Mormon restoration stems from the prophet Joseph Smith, who was called by God to restore the ancient Christian church to the Earth through revelation, the visitation of angels, and visions.  To help people overcome their skepticism, a new volume of scripture was brought forth and translated, and we have it today as the Book of Mormon.  Witnesses were also called to testify of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon, as they were allowed to see the book and the angel Moroni, and hear the voice of God declare the translation to be correct.      Mormons believe in a living prophet who has authority to speak for God, and an open and ever-expanding canon of scripture.  They believe the church is led by Christ himself through revelation, and that through the church he is preparing the Earth for his return.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	A Mormon is a nickname for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

MORMON ? Right or Wrong!  THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS,  or THE REFORMED CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS,   (from outside the difference is not an issue)   There are two areas of discussion.   1. The strange teachings that are very different to the Bible.   2. The Historical, literary and archaeological evidence for or against their claim to the  truth.  We shall look briefly at a couple of points about their teaching first. (Section 1 above)    1. God is one of many self progressing deities, formerly a finite man (evolving).   (obviously contrary to the Bible)   2. Jesus Christ, a self progressing deity (Jehovah of the Old Testament). The first spirit  child  of ELOHIM and His WIFE.   3. Humans have pre-existing spirits. (children of God and his wife)   4. and most of their other teaching is contrary to every established Bible teaching. So Bible  believing Christians need go no further but the following information will be useful to warn  anyone becoming interested in The Latter Day Saints religion.   So it is very important to know if their is any evidence to back their claims. The issue is  not so much their strange teachings that are contrary to the Bible but whether they can claim  truth. So discussion 2 will be given most attention. Since it is a challenge to Bible truth and we  know history, literary and archaeological evidence support the Bibles accuracy if Mormonism  cant support its claims we dont have to examine it further as this will show it to be false and  definitely not Christian.     Now about point two. Is there any evidence for truth in this strange last days religion.     P26.  They claim to have restored the original Gospel 1800 years after the apostasy of the  early church. But there was no universal apostasy in the early church and there is no evidence it  taught current Mormon doctrine.   p27. Mormons agree the credibility of their church stands or falls on the First Vision. It  was first  published  in  Times and Signs in  1842,  20 years after  the claimed  event. However  at least  5 earlier drafts exist making Smiths final account least credible. The first known  account was written by Smith in 1832. The variations involve Smiths age, the presence of an  evil power, Smiths reason for seeking the Lord, the existence of a revival and the number of  divine personages in the vision.(5 variations). One example is the date of the revival of 1824-5  which he dated at 1820. This error should not occur when written at the actual time. Then in the  1835-6 Smith doesnt mention God or Christ. but only many spirits or angels who testify of  Jesus.   Ex Mormons, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, have examined three different handwritten  manuscripts of the first vision written by Smith or his scribes and all are different. They declare  ultimately it becomes very difficult to believe Smith ever had the vision.   p28. Evidence of problems: The book of Mormon was translated by occult means as he put  a seer stone into a hat and buried his face in it to exclude light. Then reformed Egyptian (no  such writing has ever been found) appeared with its translation which he read to a scribe  (sometimes one of his wives) who wrote down what he said day after day.    Other problems: 1.The content of the Book of Mormon contains detailed discussion about  current (1820s) social, political and religious concerns not expected in the translation of a 1400  year old Egyptian text. It includes the story of the Nephite Jews from 600 B.C. to 421 A.D.   migrating to America. The American Bureau of Ethnology advised that there is no evidence  Nephite Jews ever existed and no Jews ever migrated from Israel to America. They also state  pre-Columbian Indians had no knowledge of the Bible nor Christianity.   2. p29. Plagiarism - the copying of other writing and claiming it as original. It contains  much of Ethan Smiths book, View of the Hebrews (1823) and 1000s of words from the King  James Bible (translated first in the 1600s). The Tanners listed 400 verses and portions of K.J.V.  New Testament in their book The Case against Mormonism. as well as K.J.V. textual errors  still there. No alarm here to K.J.V readers. It is true the 1611 version is not being used today as a  number of small translation errors and mistakes did occur. It is a perfectly good Bible but we  need to remember it was the original manuscripts that were inspired by God without error. In  2Nephi 14:5 from Isaiah 4:5 the word defence should be canopy. and in 2 Nephi15:25  (Isaiah 5:25) torn should be refuse. If it was an inspired translation there would be no errors.  Certainly there are some variations in  English Bible texts but the translators are not claiming  inspired translation. These variations are because of language change and some archaeological  finds clarify some old words which have been corrected.  Now archaeology is an embarrassment  to|`|b9791c0d942f7d7caa7f70d6161e349caa	Read One nation under Gods, I have read 5 books on Mormonism and this is by far the best, it is a fascinating read.

The Mormon Church is commonly referred to by Mormons, simply as LDS, short for Latter-day Saints.  THE ORIGIN OF THE MORMON CHURCH    The Church was founded by Joseph Smith. Joseph Smith was born in Vermont in 1805. Somewhat confused as a young man about the disagreements between the denominational churches of his day, Joseph Smith took the verse found in James 1:5 to the Lord in prayer. James 1:5 says If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. NKJV    As the story goes, Joseph Smith, lacking wisdom on which church to join, walked into the woods to pray about which church to join. It was there, in 1820, that Joseph Smith, at the young age of 15, says that God the Father and His Son, Jesus, appeared to him. They supposedly informed him that the churches were all wrong, their creeds were an abomination, and their professors were all corrupt.    A Christians response to the claims of the Mormon Church, (as we will do in tonights class) is not a mean spirited attack on their faith (as some Mormon missionaries will claim) it is a response to Joseph Smiths attack on Christianity.    Three years later, in 1823, Joseph Smith alleges that a glorified resurrected being named Moroni appeared to him, and told him of golden plates that were buried in a nearby hillside, in Cumorah, New York. These plates, as the story goes, contained a record of ancient people who had migrated from the near east to America in 600 B.C. [See the Book of Mormon: Introduction]    The words on the plates, according to Joseph Smith, were written by a man named Mormon, an ancient prophet-historian.    In 1827 the angel Moroni supposedly again appeared to Smith. He directed him to unearth the plates and begin translating the Reformed Egyptian characters inscribed on them with the supernatural power of God. Joseph Smith says that he was forbidden by Moroni from revealing these golden plates to anybody lest he be destroyed. Before the plates were taken from the earth, three witnessesDavid Whitmer, Martin Harris, and Oliver Cowderyprayed with Smith that they might see the plates. According to the introduction in the Book of Mormon an angel of God came down from heaven, in June of 1829, and laid the plates before their eyes to see.    According to the record, some time after Joseph Smith was done translating the plates, the plates were removed by Moroni and to this day are not available for inspection. It is interesting to note that all three individuals eventually left the church. [Martin Harris, did return to the Mormon Church late in his life, even though in the interim he had said that several other churches were true.]    In March of 1830, three years after having supposedly received the plates, Joseph Smith published his results. The name of the book? The Book of Mormon.    The Book of Mormon, claims right on its cover to be: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. The Book of Mormon is made up of 15 books or divisions and appears to be slightly bigger than our New Testament. It claims to be an abridged account of Gods dealings with the original inhabitants of the American continent, between about 600 B.C. to 421 A.D. It teaches that Jesus, after his resurrection, came to America, performed miracles, and chose 12 men from a people known as the Nephites to be His American disciples.    One month after the publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830, Joseph Smith founded his church in Fayette, New York. In 1844 Joseph Smith was killed at the hand of an angry mob while in prison. Brigham Young (1801-77) took over leadership as the second president of the group, and relocated the followers of Joseph Smiths teachings to Salt Lake City, Utah (where the Church is headquartered to this day). [The current Mormon President is Gordon B. Hinckley]    With its emphasis on family values,  65,000 full time missionaries, hundreds of millions of dollars to spend on advertising every year it's not hard to understand how the church has grown to 12 million people worldwide. That number that is expected to double in the next ten years. Brigham Young University projects that by the year 2080 there will be more than 256 million Mormons worldwide, assuming that the church grows at its present rate.        FOUR FALSE TEACHINGS OF THE MORMON CHURCH    Lets briefly consider four false teachings of the Mormon Church, and then we'll turn our attention more thoroughly tonight to the Book of Mormon itself.    1. The Mormon Churchs view of God.    Mormonism is a polytheistic religion [see for instance, The Pearl of Great Price, Abraham 5:1-21]. That is, they believe in the existence of more than one god. Although Mormons believe in the existence of more than one god, they only worship one God, whom they call Heavenly Father o|`|DRSv6SOLaa	They teach a false gospel and a false christ!  (They are a Cult!)  They actually believe that The Creator God is brothers to the devil!!  P.S.  Beware of that "Evangelical" out there with red hair by the way!  She 'preaches' a false gospel and a false christ and is NOT an evangelical at all!|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	they believe in Jesus but they think that Christians have it all wrong and their leader found gold tablets in the USA and he alone read them with a magical rock and wrote where they are the lost tribe of Isearel and abuch of crap like that|`|um9W8Dy8aa	Check out official Mormon sites to find out what they really believe in and teach    No Pre marital Sex    They are not Christian theologically but they are morally, culturally and sociologically|`|f19ee1045aef72436e9f25e3d464e467aa	yes we are christians. we believe that god christ and the holy spirit are different beings. we don't believe in premarital sex. we aren't racist. and we don't hate gay people.|`|ikDoMPgbaa	There views are significantly different than typical Christians. Like Muslims, they believe that a Prophet came to Earth after Jesus to deliver a 3rd part to the Bible. Only this Prophet wasn't Muhammad but a guy named Joe Smith.     Unlike Muslims, they believe that Jesus was the Messiah.|`|IqPz1PZOaa	Mormon is actually not the correct title of how The Church Of Jesus Christ OLDS would prefer to be portrayed as.  The LDS Church is a title that is okay to use but you must not try and represent Mormonism by trying to address as anything other than TCOJCOLDS.    A Latter Day Saint member is what would be considered a Mormon, as you called it, or even one of the Members of the Tru-Church is quite alright also.      They believe many strange things apart from the more mainstream religions including the very most liberal and various Christian denominations.  And most of their participants pretty much remain largely confused about what might be true by the leadership's own admission.  Simply because parishioners are forbidden to engage Internet search engines like Google to help discover all that their Church believes.     Joseph's Myth  PostMormon.org

lYx5qn6uaa	Women are always in competition mode. They think that it makes them look better to belittle all competition around them. Personally, I don't see the sense in this because it makes them look insecure and childish. I have never been jealous or catty, but have experienced it from some of my best friends and even family. It hurt so bad and I dwelled on it until I realized, this is just how it is. I can not change someone's thoughts, so why bother. I just live my life and if anyone wants to get catty, so be it, I think it's infantile and hilarious.|`|g7SUs2A6aa	Only some women are like that, not all!

They have more friends with who they get together to converse and commiserate.  And they seem to care more about how people feel about them.  On the positive side, I think this is why females often have friendships with deeper emotional connections than male friendships.  But on the negative side, when female friendships go sour or competition is introduced into the dynamic, things can get really ugly.|`|lHpR2Kcvaa	Some females are just mean. And some males are mean too...not all guys are nice towards other guys. Some are, some aren't. It's the same for both genders.|`|16PIz77qaa	People always invariably will be hostile to others, it's just that guys are much more open about it. Sometimes they avoid each other, sometimes a fight starts and then it's over. Women tend to hold grudges longer and be more underhanded about revenge.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	This behavior is learned. I think it is based in the subordinate position women have occupied in many cultures. Because women have, historically, depended on their relationships with others - particularly with men - to succeed in life (rather than controlling their own futures), they have competed with one another to determine the quality and safety of their futures and the future of their children.  For example, if a woman could make all of the other women around her lose confidence in themselves, or make them look bad, or unattractive, she then gained an "edge" in the competition for high-status males. She could make herself feared and improve her status within her peer group by exercising this power, and become high-status herself, making herself more attractive to high-status males.  These attitudes, and the perceived need for this kind of behavior have not disappeared, despite the fact that women have become more independent...things haven't changed enough to make the acquisition of a high-status male irrelevant or incidental to a woman's future, so this behavior continues to be taught. Because of that, many women view all other women as threats to be dealt with, not as friends or support systems.

But, when they  came out, alot of our friends stopped being their  friends. & only like 5 out of like 10 of us stayed their  friends. It was really lame. I love being friends with  gay people.

It's not my problem; my mom gave me a cuban name so I don't give a damn. I know black people with white names and you are just stereotyping. Why the hell do you care anyway?|`|EIAxj0eNaa	You probably think that you are being funny but those names do reek of stupidity.

Just for your information..these names such as   Chiquanika, Kwanzaa , Tyre , Khadijah , Minah .Tyesha , Jamal and etc. Are African based names they have significant meanings behind them. Please do your research and not criticize people by their names!    Ignorant people..ehh I tell ya..    I apologize  to all the Thacher , Walker  ,Forest and Williams , Elizabeths, Katherines ,and Carolines out there...|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	There are few things you must understand. First why is OK for other races and ethnic groups to name their children traditional names of their culture and ancestry but not OK for Black people? Second because your forefathers made it so we lost our traditional ancestral ways and we were forced to take on names like John, William, Betty, Mary and so on. I'm not saying these are not good names I'm saying they are not our names. These are traditional White European names. We are not White. Why should we wear the names of White people? You don't see White people naming their sons Omowele or their daughters Mei Ling do you?  Third it's not the name that matters it the person that gives that name meaning that matters. You could ask the same thing about Barack Hussein Obama. What kind of name is that? That's the name of the President of the United States of America. That's what kind of name it is.|`|CN7klGgbaa	You must be bored, why don't you cruise the internet for some Scat Porn, which was created by your "superior" white brothers and sisters...Because of course we all know there is nothing more superior than smearing your own feces on other people's bodies during what some whites TRY to call "sex." I notice you are refering to blacks as monkeys, well maybe you should take a long look in the mirror, because last time i checked its only monkeys that eat their own feces.|`|omMo81o8aa	a lot of these names that people think are made up or weird are actually names of Muslim or french origin. do some research before you try to call somebody out. and if you THINK about it....ALL names are made up. they have to come from SOMEwhere. just because it is a name you have never heard of beforee doesn't make it "weird" or "crazy" you can't judge somebody else's culture using your own cultural lens. You can't be that close minded.|`|3QNwf2eMaa	I know a friggin white guy named Dwayne.|`|jdKTs3aHaa	aww what happened a black girl broke up w/ you? =((   ps: my name is Shantel does that sound like an animal name?|`|CEChcfKwaa	Now I know you're not going to talk when you have white folks naming their kids after fruit and ish like that.

I have seen it happen.|`|vmvrkWBhaa	You will not be able to understand native Spanish (music, TV) in 2 months. It is just spoken too rapidly for that to be possible.

I've been speaking Spanish for almost 40 years...lived in Spain, fluent...majored in it...still have trouble keeping up with the news!  (they talk REALLY fast!  And I always feel like I want to get every word.)    for keeping up in conversation, you really MUST have contact with a native speaker...get an online site with contact people, and hook up on something like skype with voice chat...go to nosayudamos.com, too for chat practice.  That should help you with speaking.  GOTTA PRACTICE!|`|Hx47O8llaa	ughh..id think so. You would have to be a REALLY quick learner!|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Bennington College in Vermont has a special language program .  You have a 6 week course where you speak nothing but the target language.  If you speak any other languages you will be expelled from the course and there are no refunds. The classes are intense and vocabulary is gained at a rate of 100 words per day.  Speaking any language requires a minimum of 300 hours of the language spoken in a meaningful fashion.  E.g.  Buenos dias.  (2 seconds -- 299 H 58 seconds to go)  You will be intermediate to upper intermediate level after a class at Bennington.    2 months of 2 hours a day is 120 hours so you should be able to get by.  If you want to improve your listening comprehension start watching Spanish TV.  The more exposure you have to the language spoken at normal or accelerated speed the better your comprehension will be.

jHUzUuZRaa	I've often wondered how people could argue about stuff that can not be proven? But they do. It tends to boil down to the age old question, "did God create man or did man create God"? It is common that people do not like to be told that they are wrong, or that what they believe has no factual bases, so they base their arguments off ancient writings that can not be proven either.

There is little evidence that 'bashing' of anyone by anyone is written in the articles of faith, belief, and practice of any of the world's major faiths, and yet some adherents of all have been found to be militant to the point of forgetting who they and what standards they have accepted, and then fall out of their trees and even become violent, sometimes murdering their opposition.    There are probably few that can resist the temptation to dun others down for their beliefs or for what the critic 'thinks' are the other's beliefs.  Most often they are wrong about what the other's religion or denomination actually teaches and actually practices.    Sociologists of religion have studied this 'errant' behaviour in the professedly religious for more than two centuries, although its high time came in the second half of the previous century.    The consensus, generally stated, is that each faith and denomination attracts a 'fringe element' of followers that fails to maintain the highest standards of their religion's ethical code.  This anomal behaviour results in factions, schisms, militantism, disorder, and verbal, emotional, and physical attacks made against those they see as 'other' often with terrible consequences.    People usually mock those they consider superior than themselves, but the source of positive antipathy can stem from knowing too little about one's own faith to actively debate beliefs, policies, practices, and even histories, whilst maintaining a religious attitude and a civil tone.      But even as these 'rogue elements' are found in every synagogue, chapel, mascq, etc, themajorityy of their fellow-adherents should not be judged by the worst examples of their members, norwouldd their doctrines be put down for any similar reason.    One of the most ideal, Godlike, even, characteristics a religious person can achieve is the insight to see how another's religion benefits him and his family and the body of worshippers, even though he himself does not hold to its teachings.    The active principles in religious prejudice, hatred, and bigotry are,     1.  Ignorance, and its step-child,    2.  bigotry.

AA12288062	Men can not marry into the nobility. Men can only inheirit a title or earn one.Americans can inherit titles and carry dual citizenship.But Americans,when they are granted honorary titles,such as a nonhereditary knighthood,cannot use the title of "Sir."  http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/page4877....  "Foreign citizens occasionally receive honorary knighthoods; they are not dubbed, and they do not use the style 'Sir'. "  And non-UK citizens cannot be given hereditary peerage titles,the lowest peerage title being baronet.It is quite difficult to be made a baron;one must be extremely talented and successful in one's field of work like Laurence Olivier,considered the finest actor of his generation(and many other generations as well),or Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd-Webber,the prolific composer- playwrights(Cats,Evita,Phantom of the Opera being a few of their works),or a former Prime Minister.  And real titles cannot be purchased;there are organzations such as Burke's Peerage,Debrett's,and the Almanac de Gotha society,that keep tabs on who is really nobility and who is not.|`|AA11411923	It is possible to buy a small (tiny!) piece of land in Scotland off of many websites, in which case, you would, if you were a British citizen, be styled as The Much Honored Name Name, Laird of Place. However, since you are a citizen of the United States of America, and the Constitution of the United States states that no American may hold a title of nobility, you are not eligible to hold such a style unless you hold dual nationality, which I do not suspect that you do. Even if you were eligible, and indeed married into the nobility, you wouldn't necessarily hold a title. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the husband of Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal is styled Vice-Admiral Timothy James Hamilton Laurence CB MVO ADC(P) CSM, however this is simply because of his position within the Royal Navy, in addition to some honours that Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the 2nd has bestowed unto him since his marriage. The point is - he didn't automatically hold a royal style.|`|AA10067344	By far, the easiest way to achieve title is to buy it.  Many titles of nobility in Europe are still tied to land.  If you buy the land, the title comes with it.|`|RMHOO0Mhaa	Very doubtful if you can obtain, read the article on the link below it is pretty informative and also humourous    http://www.greeleynet.com/~maxalla/OKHSS...|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	I vaguely remember someone telling me that when the USA declared Independence something was written that declared All citizens equal and that no american can hold a royal title.    If you became a citizen of the UK or other commonwealth country you could hold a title.     If you are female you could marry someone e.g. a Duke and become a Duchess.    If you are male you have to become a knight where you can use the title Sir.    If you want something like Duke, Earl, Marquis etc. I expect that you would have to take a bullet for the Queen these are very rarely given out to just anyone.      Titles attached to land are not well respected and it would be know that you bought the title. Its similar to just saying "I am John Smith owner of ______ farm"|`|olahi6esaa	High ranking officers in the British Armed forces used to get doled out titles, like viscount or earl, but  today your best bet would be to marry into nobility or buy a title.|`|lPxVt2XYaa	You could try marrying into the nobility.

Let's pretend you're not American for a second. You could marry the daughter of a Lord (so, say Lord John Smith of Nottingham or whatever) then you would be given the title of Lord, as your wife would be Lady whatever. But, yes, the easiest way would be to...sigh..buy it. Personally, I find that not very legit. But, seeing as you're American, then you cannot become a Lord or Lady of the COMMONWEALTH which the United States is part of.

A) You say "Christians" when what I think you mean is "Creationists". The idea that all Christians are Creationists is common on TV and in popular culture, but it is a straw man argument, (that's a logical fallacy) and totally untrue. Something close to 1/3 of the humans on Earth are Christians of one sort or another. http://www.religioustolerance.org/worldr...  of that there are hundreds, if not thousands of different forms of Christianity though Most of the Christian denominations and sects in the world can be sorted into about eight segments or branches: Roman Catholicism,   Eastern Orthodoxy,   Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches,   Protestantism   Restorationists   Anglican Communion   Pentecostals   Others "  http://www.religioustolerance.org/christ...    Of that only SOME of the Protestants and Pentecostals (and Others of course, assuming they mean "non-doms") teach anything close to Creationism. (I'm one of the group that considers Restorationists to be non-Christian).     In any case, the vast majority of Christians have no doctrinal problem with the Theory of Evolution, that being : Roman Catholicism, Anglican Communion, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodox and Assyrian Churches, and the vast majority of Protestants.   So your first premise, that  Christians don't believe in evolution is simply untrue...FALSE is indeed the technicaly correct term.    That may be what TV tells you is true... that's normally the way Christians are depicted on TV, but that's not the way the REAL world really is at all.     B)  Your second implied premise (and second fallacy... that of presumption) is that Christians believe in the "law of attraction."  I know only one person who believes in the law of attraction. She is a lawyer I used to work with.  She was so excited by "the Secret" she gave copies to all the legal assistants in our firm...(to help them improve their lives). (The legal assistants incidentally though she was an idiot.) She's by no means dumb (dumb people don't pass bar exams) but she's pretty much subcontracted out her higher brain centers to NPR, Obama, and the Democratic National Committie. She is NOT a Christian as far as I know, she considers herself far to smart and sophistacted for that...she lets the editorial page of the New York Times do all her thinking for her, and since THEY aren't Christian, neither is she.    I know a great many Christians, and NONE of them believe in "the Secret" or "the law of attraction."  Christianity abhors superstition, that may be why.    C) You assume that science and Christianity are at odds. This too is a straw man argument often seen on TV, but again it is false.   This is my favorite example http://vaticanobservatory.org/ to disprove it, but this works pretty well too http://www.zephyrus.co.uk/gregormendel.h...    So please don't go thinking that just because people have accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, they must be some sort of ignorant rube and you can rock their world with something you just discovered in your Upper Third Form Science Text...especially when your questions show that you lack any grasp of even basic logic. It's kind of insulting.    and oh... the fact your "trick question" contains several logical fallacies...that pretty much implies that there IS indeed something "dumber than the law of attraction".|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	I'm losing brain cells trying to understand why some individuals are taking your question so seriously!

If you focus on anything long enough, AND DO THE STEPS you will accomplish or attract it.  But, the theory of Evolution is comparitive to stupidity.

c3474cd1d5137c5d6298fa6134dcf3c8aa	Absolutely! I think having a few friends over for a little party at the house is fine. Have a birthday cake, open a few presents, play pin the tail on the donkey....then everyone goes home. That is acceptable up to about age 13. After that maybe the family could go out to eat in celebration, or they can have a friend or two spend the night.     People have taken to having outrageous them parties though where they take 20 kids and get box seats at a baseball game for instance. Then when they are teenagers, instead of the parties getting smaller, they just get more extravagant. People buy their kids brand new cars, hire bands and catering services, invite the whole school, and basically make them prince or princess for the day. It's crazy.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Me, I like to take my friends somewhere, have cake, I get presents, and we have fun.

Because we're nice people.  I don't invite the whole school, maybe 12 girls at the most, and I won't be princess for a day.  Or get a new car on my sweet 16.  I'll probably inherit the HHR.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Lighten up a bit and let your kids enjoy their childhood. People have always had parties, invited friends over and gave gifts for birthdays. Even in the 1970's. You sound really stingy. You can't blame your children because your friends were never invited over for your birthday when you were younger. You should be glad your daughters are getting invited to parties. If I found out one of my son/daughters friends had a parent with your attitude then it would put me off inviting them. So just chill....I mean you would just spend the money on something else anyway so what difference does it make if you need to buy a present? Birthdays are for celebrating so stop being boring. I mean when it is one of your daughters birthdays you invite people to her party and you get all the presents back again so in the long run you really aren't losing anything. What next...are you going to stop buying christmas presents and easter eggs at easter, oh and what about valentines day...you might not want to celebrate that because it involves buying your wife a gift! Where does it end. Just chill.

If we act wisely in Gods eyes, we make a good name for ourselves with God. But it takes time. On the day of our birth we have not lived long enough to make any kind of name at all. Furthermore, we are born under Adamic sin and condemned to death. (Rom. 5:12) Hence, if years later, on the day of our death, we have made a good name with God, we have something that we did not possess on the day of our birth. We have a name that God will remember when he resurrects the dead to life under Christs kingdom. The remembrance of the righteous one is due for a blessing, but the very name of the wicked ones will rot.Prov. 10:7.|`|AA10192697	From the NAB: Chapter 7 is the critique of sages on the day of adversity.

This verse is also talked about in Ecc 4:2 "and those now dead, I declared more fortunate in death than are the living to be still alive."    I believe it because how I live my life determines where I live afterwards,. If I end up in hell, I'd wish I'd rather not be born at all.

No one lies in the grave at the moment of death the soul leaves the body and goes to the Haden world. That is the place of the unseen souls after death. There are two sides to it, one torment, the other paradise/comfort and there is a great gulf fixed bewteen the two. So they cannot pass to the other side.    Luk 16:23  And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.   Luk 16:24  And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.   Luk 16:25  But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.

In fundamental Christian Theology NOBODY, BUT NOBODY BEATS THE ABORTION CLINICS IN SENDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF SOULS OF THE UNBORN TO BE WITH THE LORD JESUS CHRIST FOR EVER AND EVER IN HEAVEN!!! So why are the Christians so noxious against the abortionists and hate them so much when they are doing a much better job sending souls to Heaven than ALL THE CHURCH MISSIONARIES AND PREACHERS PUT TOGUETHER!!!??? unless it is sheer Christian envy!!!    What is more important? To allow the soul of a fetus to go to Heaven through a NECESSARY ABORTION for whatever reason or to let it be born and grow past the age of accountability and never becoming a Christian of the right brand so he/she can go to Heaven to be with Jesus?    Take this real Bible scenario in God's HELL of a mother and her son or daughter being tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric fire when back on Earth the MOTHER WAS PLANNING TO ABORT HER CHILD.  If she would have done so the child fetus would be in HEAVEN now with JESUS for ever and ever, but instead mother and son or daughter are sizzling in HELL together because some Christian Fundies were picketing the abortion clinics and forced the mother to change her mind!!!         In fundamental Christian Theology THEY HAVE THE POWER TO SEND SOULS TO HEAVEN GUARANTEED THROUGH ABORTION!!!     OR    THEY CAN LET THE SAME SOULS HAVE A CHANCE AT A LIVE BIRTH and give them an opportunity to believe in the claims of Jesus Christ as soon as they pass the age of accountability that is, if they are lucky enough to be in the right place and at the right time to hear what the Bible writers say about Jesus Christs claims...  failure to do so will guarantee them to go to be tormented for ever and ever in Hell!!!    How can a Christian be happy in Heaven looking at the many fetuses of unborn children from mothers who are now in HELL?  The fetuses were lucky enough to have been aborted at the right time and they are in Heaven, but their mothers are now in HELL because they never accepted Jesus Christ as a personal Savior, either!  BTW, most of the fetuses in Heaven will come from Red China where abortion is mandatory by law under certain conditions Can you imagine American Christians in Heaven surrounded by the souls of billions of aborted Chinese fetuses? They are all enjoying watching the souls of NON-ABORTED fetuses of grown up Americans sizzling in HELL.  All because some evil minded Christian clergy refused their mothers a needed abortion for whatever reason.  So they were set up to go to Hell as soon as they grow up past the age of accountability without believing in the right Christian brand!     If you have the patience of reading Numbers 5:11-31 with all the foot notes you will discover that God is in the BUSINESS of making life miserable for the ladies any lady and at the same time he is in the abortion business, too strictly for MONEY for the priests! This portion of Holy Scripture is so sickening that it is totally ignored by most members of the Clergy and preachers In essence, the wife of a jealous husband is forced to appear before the LORD and drink about half a gallon of a sickening concoction brewed by the priest and made of dirt taken from the soil around the altar of the LORD that will cause the womb to swell and the thigh* (*fetus) to fall away    Numbers 5:22 (NIV) May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes away.[fn5]  Then the woman is to say, Amen. So be it.* (*Yeah you better say it loud and clear so we can all hear ya!!!)  [fn5] or body and cause you to be barren and have a miscarrying womb    If the woman survives without anything falling away from her womb then she is innocent of suspicion of adultery and her husband is COMPLETELY CLEAN OF ANY WRONG DOING!!!  BTW notice that you need to bring MONEY to the PRIEST every time that you want to perform this test on your wife!!! The never changing Bible God wants you to perform this test on your wife ANYTIME YOU FEEL JEALOUS!!! Biblically speaking, JEALOUSY is a VALID REASON for a FORCED ABORTION!!! I dont believe that any other Heathen Gods today are as primitive and uncivilized as the Bible God! And the Christian ladies go crazy for it!  Saint Joseph should have taken his young virgin fianc the Blessed Virgin Mary to have this test done on her!  The sucker didnt do it and now the world is stuck with Christianity!|`|E9chZY74aa	Paul said that to live is painful, but to die is to be in Heaven.
Hf1UkrWXaa	I like the direction you're taking with this, although I accept evolution as the probable means for life as it is today. We are wrong time and time again though. I hate this ongoing war between sides of who's smarter than who. I hope I'm not offending, but I find most atheists to be intellectually honest, but then most of them open their mouths about politics and I think they're nuts. Crazies come from all ends I'm saying. IMHO :/|`|AA10493307	Good point.  When religion fails to inspire, its leaders tend to treat it as a business.|`|bc6MlMyoaa	Evolution is the core theory when it comes our understanding of biology .  It is one of the most heavily supported theories in science, up there with gravity and such.  Granted, our understanding of evolution has changed greatly since the idea was first proposed.  But it has yet to be disproven.  So trying to 'keep an open mind,' is great and all, but not if you're going to ignore over a century of scientific research because of it.  Being open minded does mean being willing to accept that you're wrong, but it also means allowing yourself to come to terms with the evidence currently available.    That being said, if some piece of evidence comes out which refutes it, great!  We're learning something!  That means we're one step closer to finding the truth.  But we'll never progress anywhere if all we do is sit around saying 'Isn't life mysterious?  God sure is amazing."|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I can't tell whether you are insulting Catholics and/or saying that belief in Jesus is not rational...but you do know jack. You are right there.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Evolution is a flexible scientific explanation for what we (apparently most people except for you!) observe; though a complete Theory, it is open to (and embraces) any evidence that suggests it is not accurate.  "Faith", on the other hand, is completely inflexible adherence to a fictional nonsense.|`|VitK0Wenaa	The problem is that you cannot discuss science by using the language of religion.    In every single instance where creationists have tried to challenge evolution, they start out by saying that evolution is only a theory. Right off the bat they are using a common language definition of a term that has a very specific and different definition in science.    Anytime you are discussing science, mathematics, chemistry or any other discipline, you need to use very specific and clear terminology. If you do not know how to describe and explain the various concepts that come into play, you are in no position to challenge those concepts.    When you approach someone that has actually studied evolution, and right off the bat it becomes clear that you do not even know the correct terminology, the conversation ends.     Those of us who work in the sciences have no need to discuss the validity of evolution, it has been proven to exist, it can be duplicated in controlled studies.     We also have no problem accepting that there are things we do not know.     The problem is that science and a belief in evolution is not incompatible with religion. It was Einstein that said "I seek to know God's thoughts, the rest is details." Many of the top scientists, including Darwin believed in God.    But it seems that a belief in religion can sometimes be incompatible with science.|`|SoY4IiYBaa	atheists don't rely on Faith, my friend...|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I'm sorry if some atheists are like that, but if people have questions about evolution I genuinely try to answer them, without calling names.|`|ViZH5twNaa	Faith is belief without evidence. Evolution is a scientific theory and thus must be supported with evidence. If it had none I would not think it was true.    DIVINE FAIL    *edit*  Faith is belief without evidence so how can one have faith in evidence? You are butchering the definition of faith.|`|tsgP2JfBaa	Lot's of people feel that way.

Incidentally, if you have been "monitoring" the atheists here as you say, and yet think Interior Castle is one, then you haven't been doing a very good job.|`|uxfacsgmaa	I see what you're saying, but remember that there is a difference between defending a well-established fact of life, evolution, and defending a Bronze Age creation myth for which there is absolutely zero tangible proof. The degree of 'fundy-ism' varies from person to person, obviously, but I really do think that those who accept the theory of evolution are more justified in their certainty than those who cleave to the Bible.    Just an opinion.|`|SqhGr6e3aa	No, because we don't use the Pope's Pear on people who don't accept evolution.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	I am self-assured in the knowledge that evolution is the absolute truth.  I am not into calling opponents ignorant fundamentalists or anything like that but anyone with a decent education knows that evolution makes logical and rational sense.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	The only one allowed to monitor here is the atheati. Once again, youthink atheist = evolution. Please learn the definition.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Nonsense.  Evolution is a scientific theory with an enormous amount of observational and experimental evidence behind it.  It is, in principle, falsifiable, although successful falsification would have to explain by alternate means a gigantic body of facts---essentially all of modern biology, biochemistry, and genetics.    Of course an omnipotent god could simply create things to look as if they had evolved.  Such a god would, however, be a trickster, using his powers to deceive.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	No.|`|AA12059478	Stick around for a few months. Then restate your opinion.|`|oHrqbdydaa	You seem to fail to realize that Evolution has enough evidence to bury any doubt whatsoever. It is among the most stable, provable and true theories ever to be discovered in the history of modern man.  Your question suggests it is "faith-based" or somehow tenuous,  when in fact astronomy, plate tectonics, marine biology, biology, genetics, micro-biology, paleontology and geology have their full weight behind it.     One could hardly come up with any more provable scientific theory other than a round earth and gravity.|`|NCRfZRopaa	No. Faith is believing without evidence. Since there are books upon books upon books of evidence for evolution, it's not faith.|`|HIskrREJaa	i personally don't care if people believe in creation.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Whatever your opinion about evolution, it is pretty silly to compare atheist thinking with the primitive mindset of catholics, whether modern or medieval, as though there were a difference.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	I don't know. Please explain what you mean by "the mindset of medieval Catholics" and the source of your understanding.|`|H7jy99NOaa	Interesting. I hadn't noticed anybody refute evolution.

So, no.|`|d7xE8bYFaa	The specific details of the process of evolution may need addition or revision as we learn more, but the basic idea of evolution has been confirmed.  Still, it's not that I'm against people challenging widely accepted and proven theories, it's just that when the creationists do so, they tend to do it with logical fallacies and misinformation.  No one should tolerate that.  If they want to challenge evolution logically and using empirical evidence, they should do so.  I'd be interested in what they had to say.  But somehow I doubt this will ever happen.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	It's not a contest...if the scientific method were to produce enough evidence that we needed a paradigm shift concerning the origins of life, then that shift would eventually take place....what is NOT going to happen is that the scientific method is going to produce superstitious evidence, which includes holding up a book of bronze age and ancient Mediterranean storytelling and claiming "wowie! this is real science!"....it's really as simple as that...and though you say you've been monitoring the atheists on R&S, perhaps you should spend some time monitoring the ID proponents who think IF they can produce enough doubt about Evolution, their religion is somehow the default science...|`|eomrfXrzaa	We actually have proof for our claims, so we're allowed to assert them as the only valid ones.  Evidence and reason are legitimate bragging causes, magical fairy men and absurdly outdated philosophy are not.|`|TLLklriUaa	When people who claimed to have studied evolution try and refute it with such gems as "if we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?", they are ignorant.    Sorry.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	No, more like some Christians view on evolution is more like the mindset of medieval Catholics concerning the geocentric view (they opposed heliocentrism that Galileo proposed).|`|FfxmE9Toaa	You're assuming arrogance when what you're observing is weariness. Creationists deny evolution but never refute it.    Science is never static so your question about evolving the approach is a bit disingenuous. It is not about faith but about evidence. My Christian father was a scientist and he'd have refused to answer you. Not because he was arrogant but because he was tired of being accused of worshipping the scientific method. As he put it, "I don't like to waste time on this." He meant fools but was too kind to say so.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	That's not even a decent try!    A scientist looks at the evidence and draws conclusions So far the observable conclusions are that the universe is billions of years old and many events must have taken place during that time including, but not limited to a big bang theory! Christians read some of the Bible and look around for supporting evidence that the universe is only 6,000 years old and at the same time they are forcing their primitive dogmas on the rest of society...     According to the Bible writers, Gen 1:1 the Earth was already created in a previous attempt, but it was VOID* (*by a higher power??? WHY VOID??? Did some other God screw it?). 6,000 years ago the Earth was in pitch darkness and full of water... so God* (*BTW, the Hebrew word for God is Elohim and it stands for a plurality of GODS like the Greeks and Babylonians had! 1 Cor 8:5). So God (Elohim speaking in plural) grabs the Earth and re-creates it, but this time with all the trimmings like SEPARATING the waters from the land, which in itself is quite a miracle considering gravitational levels, capacity, and so on! God goes on creating the Sun, the Moon, the stars and the rest of the universe that extends billions of light years away from the Earth (To Gods own credit the light of the most distant observable star or galaxy reached the Earth during the Creation Week!) The Bible writers are telling us that everything that God was creating "was good, very good! But soon enough God had to deal with all kinds of glitches. If all these glitches are multiplied by the number of worlds that we can observe in this universe, God better go looking for a new job! God created man to till a small garden that he planted in the region of Babylon-today's Iraq. Apparently it was here that the writers started to do the script on the Bible. Even the Ark of Noah landed not far from Iraq or rather Babylon. The Bible writers introduced to the Jews a humble God wanting to own a garden on this microscopic speck of dust called Earth at the edge of the Milky Way in this humongous universe! It seems like Christians had to give up their sense of proportion to become Christians! Adam was created in God's image... MALE! It was in that image that Adam was very much focused in finding a help meet or mate for himself among ALL THE ANIMALS that this Bible God created while he was busy name tagging them one by one under Gods supervision. At Gods suggestion Adam must have tried to enjoy sexually who knows how many animals, but even God admitted that for Adam, NO HELP MATE WAS FOUND. God admits another glitch in his very good creation that creating man alone is "no good" after all (Gen 2:18-20)!    Please bear in mind that the whole Creation story and the adventures of God and Jesus throughout the Bible were put together by people like many of us. In the Bible script Eve was created as an afterthought after it was proven that no animal was 100% suitable for Adam's pleasure. Modern day Bible scholars insist that the Bible ought not to be taken literally short of seriously! Originally, Adam must have had either sterile semen or compatible semen that would work on any animal! But that changed when Eve was finally created out of one of Adamss phallic rib bones. God must have restructured Adams sexual reproductive system tooWhen Eve was introduced to Adam, Adam knew a lot about sex so he was not acting like a nerd with her. Most likely their first sexual arrangement was doggy style... and so on. Christians are very selective on what they wish to believe and force others to believe from the Bible. BTW, when I was questioning some of this stuff in Bible College I was sternly warned not to provoke the wrath of God so I let God, those who have the rule over us, and the leading of God the Holy Ghost, or what have you control my thoughts for most of my life totally convinced and with a clear conscience that I was the clay in the potters hand! I am not joking! Obviously you dont need much of an IQ along with a well defined degree of gullibility oops sorry, faith to successfully attend Christian College and work in the Christian ministry and I was a borderline case. I had unanswered questions and the elaborate commentaries by expert theologians that I was using were of no help at all! No Preacher can depend on the Bible alone to represent his/her brand of Christianity. Almost everything in the Bible needs to be interpreted arbitrarily according to your brand of faith and that is why we have so many faith!    In that first Creation week of 7x24 = 168 hours... the Bible God also created all the angels in Heaven and as soon as he did that ONE THIRD of them were not one bit impressed by Gods glory and beauty and rebelled against him on the spot! God did not destroy them, but he created a HELL AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT to burn them for ever and ever NOT NOW, but later on at the end of the world! (Rev 12:4,9) God is in desperate need of demonic powers to hurt the people that he loves so much and to send them to the Hell that God prepared for Satan and his angels! Low IQ humans always blame somebody else for all their pain and suffering. The poor Devil is such a handy scapegoat! The preachers hide these Bible stories from everybody saying that the atheists are twisting the Word of God showing only what is bad in it, but not the GOOD NEWS that God the Father sent God the Son Jesus Christ down to Earth to be beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers spit to be presented as a spotless Lamb of God ready to be grotesquely nailed to a Holy Cross! Only a wanking pervert would write anything like that in any book! Christians MUST regularly eat Jesus spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to be worthy of him and to go to Heaven when they die.

QMAqzpKEaa	The clock has a large hand and small hand. The small hand is on the hou that it is and the large one indicates how many minutes have passed after that hour  So, the small had would be just a little bit after the twelve but approaching the one number.  The big had will be on eight.  When the big hand was one that was 5 minutes past twelve. When the big hand was on two that was 10 minutes past. When it was on three that was 12:15 or quarter past. When on four that was twenty past and when on five that was 12:25. It goes in fives, like the five times table. So the big hand in your case is at 8 which is 12:40  If you count back from the one there are twenty minutes left until it is one o clock  But if you count from the 12 there are 40 minutes after the 12.   12:40 - twenty minutes less one/ twenty minutes left until one  10:40- las once menos veinte - twenty minutes to 11 / las diez y cuarenta|`|FEGtnUEcaa	if you substract twenty minutes from 13:00, youve got 12:40 (13:00 hours is the same as 1:00 in the afternoon).|`|GC4NRW15aa	es la una menos viente means literally 'it is one minus 20'  so think of 1 o'clock minus 20 minutes, it is 12.40|`|EpRN4oRgaa	This says,   "It is 20- minutes behind the first hour."

E9chZY74aa	You are so funny.  Trees and flowers need flying insects to pollinate.  None of it could exists without the sun.  All the laws of gravity and flight and so on had to be in effect.  Besides that no mutation has ever been good, but only disfiguring and bad.    Evolution can not pass the test of the first and second law of thermodynamics.  Sorry.  No sale here.|`|eomrfXrzaa	You got almost all of that wrong.|`|capqMpiCaa	those are called mutations, nothing to do with evolution, just bad genes.|`|AA11232725	1 out of 100 people are born with ribs on their necks, and some rare people are even born with webbed hands    The same way that you explain other birth defects. The DNA code has been scrambled and unlike most mutations these are benign instead of fatal.    http://www.foolishfaith.com/book_chap3_m...    In the same way, mutations are generally random copying mistakes in the reproduction of the genetic code (DNA), and as such, tend to be harmful. The code in DNA is simply a complex set of instructions that tells a creatures body how to reproduce itself (much the same as a set of instructions that tells a person how to reproduce a car or spaceship). Random copying mistakes (mutations), then, are obviously unlikely to improve these instructions; rather they are much more likely to damage or destroy them, as the Encyclopedia Britannica acknowledges.[17] That is why many mutations cause disease and death.[18] In fact, according to one university biology textbook, the odds that a mutation (random copying mistake) might actually improve the instructions contained in the genetic code are so low that a random change is not likely to improve the genome (genetic code) any more than firing a gunshot blindly through the hood of a car is likely to improve engine performance.[19] But this isnt surprising, since mutations are random mistakes.    Edit: but your trying to tell me that somewhere around 650000000 have the exact same genetical mutation?    No, what happened is that the mutation was benign and so it was carried on to future generations and spead through the gene pool.|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	Something called mutations... you believe in those, don't you?|`|eAMq1iBWaa	i suppose you were there to personally witness all this|`|7cjn2u9uaa	Wow you are so smart, you have convinced me.|`|uiTkwGBNaa	Defects.

They are still human.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	The webbed fingers results in a defect in the apoptosis inducing gene.  Our hands start out webbed and the space between the digits simply dies.    Interesting example of unintelligent design though, ducks still have this gene product.  Instead of turning it off, they have another protein inhibit it.  So inefficient...|`|qJXdyUY3aa	Basic science. Genetic mutations, which can be caused by a variety of things. Just because us Creationists believe that God created the world doesn't mean we aren't aware of basic scientific principles...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	And some of us are plainly born with our brains in our ***, but you prove nothing.

Discuss Evolution in the science section if you want to learn more.|`|UARQA0CLaa	The same way some people are born with an extra digit.  Sometimes cells don't split or reproduce the way God intended.  Not because God is fallible, but because something just happens, or because of drugs etc.    Buy yourself a monkey and see how long it takes him to evolve into a human.  I have it on good authority it will never happen.

I doubt you understand it, or believe in it for that matter.|`|kRkTaJHwaa	Would you please provide a link for your sources?    Webbed hands can happen for a number of reasons. Mainly because the lysosomes in the cells fail to kill the tissue cells in between the fingers and toes during birth.

There is a difference between apes and monkeys.  Do you know what it is?      There are several well known developmental defects in human foetuses that produce such anomalies as you mention, these abnormalities are often hereditary of familial, but sometimes they are accidental.      You should not read too much in them      QUILL|`|f0dbf7bef8f4954ab34a161d799935c6aa	Defects are the result of sin entering a perfect world. If you're brave enough, look at the link below.

Why the questioner gave examples that were not enough to support the question makes me wonder about the real reason for the desperate need to remove God from the minds of others.      The evolution/creation debate has not brought me an inch closer to doubting God, but rather gives me greater appreciation for the following:     Luke 10:21  At that time Jesus, full of joy through the Holy Spirit, said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure.|`|LDL5rlapaa	Wasn't there just a lady that had 8 kids,, crazy things happen, there is probably ten billion people in the world today or more,, you are going to have alot of things like that happen, it has nothing to do with evolution, genetics is not evolution, I am yet to see a lizard stand up and walk and talk,, the fact is God is our creator, the Bible is true, ignoring it or denying it won't change anything, refusing to serve Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour only puts your spirit in danger of being lost forever, don't let that happen, there are no atheists in foxholes, I know you have heard that statement, our instincts tells us there is a God, listen to your heart, and look up at the stars and planets, there has to be a creator, nothing else is logical|`|vAhZZKtRaa	look how do you know that the scientist comunity isnt making that up if someone in the science world says something and finds alittle bit of info to back up a weak theroy then all of a suddon its supposed to be real? what about the bible we have creation written out in black and white in the very beginning of the bible and we question it. and yes the webbed fingers thing is a genetic mutation so that doesnt count. God made the heavens and the earth....its as simple as that i dont get why people have to see to believe sometimes believeing is seeing     and another thing i really dont want to be eveloved from a monkey...there just plan stupid
AA11314954	You can either live with people having different religious views, or you limit yourself to practicing Christians.    Expecting people to bend to your view is not realistic.  How would you feel if he expected you to be Muslim, agnostic, Jewish or atheist.|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Stop pushing your beliefs on him.  That is the way he feels!  He will lose interest in you and in the church.  This is a turn off to everyone. You have your beliefs and he has his.  If you are dead set on your beliefs, there is no room in your heart for anyone else's beliefs. You lack the respect for everyone elses beliefs.  Maybe you should just date guys from your church or other christian churches.|`|LjsRfaskaa	You call yourself spiritual when you are trying to take someones free will away to force them to do something. You christians are such lovely people. No wonder Christianity is getting such a bad name if you are a typical representative.

That is a choice he would have to make. I suggest to go find somebody new.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	You can't make anyone do anything.|`|bEeozqacaa	If you force a person into believing something it makes you look bad. My friends are Christian & Buddhist but I am Atheist. I do not force them into my beliefs & they do not force me into their beliefs.|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	you can't make anyone do what they don't want to do.  ask yourself this: how would you feel if he said he wouldn't go out with you because you are a christian?  I would guess you wouldn't like it.  You are doing the same to him.  You are lacking tolerance to other people's religious beliefs.  You should write off a relationship with this guy.  You've turned him off so to speak.  Religion or beliefs should be something you share with your mate not something one puts before the relationship or before the mate.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	Tell him the sweetest story ever told!!!|`|77af9dfbcad746672b88d19627087b3aaa	Let me tell you a little story...  One day the wind and the sun were talking and they saw a man in a coat walking in the park.  The wind said to the sun: "I bet I can get the coat off that man."  the sun disagreed and said that he'd take that bet.    So the wind blew and blew and the man just pulled the coat around him tighter, bent his head and kept going.  The sun took his turn next and shone brightly and was kind to the man and warmed him... and the man smiled and enjoyed the warmth and took off his coat.    Ok... are you the wind or the sun?    Also... it's totally NOT COOL to force others to believe the stuff you believe.  Let him make his own decisions.  You love your god..cool. keep him to yourself.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	lessaiz faire|`|AA10719605	what, you went from liking him to converting him? maybe thats his choice not to go to church? cant you just like him and leave it at that?|`|lDEGaK7Laa	You can't "make" anyone be anything.|`|AA11091234	You can't.

They'll indoctrinate the ------ out of him.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: you don't.  You walk away because you're just going to be too annoying for him.  You can't force anyone to be anything and he's already heard "the good word"    Leave him alone.|`|80shQIOHaa	You could tell him how much religion means to you and that you could slowly, gently, reintroduce him to the church community.  Or you could back off because hey, it's really none of your business. His religion and the way he practices it is his business.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Praying and not forcing it on him. Can you witness to him using the Word of God from the Bible ?|`|6bKws0fAaa	hmm tuff one  well always remember that if is God's will then he will put this guy in front of you maybe so he can be your boyfriend or so you can take the opportunity to talk to him. If it's not God's will that you go out with him, then never go against his will and disobey him.   But it's hard to bring God into a conversation without annoying him. first you would have to bring him into a deep conversation with you guys. talk about something other than God until the talk starts getting deep. Then when both of you trust eachother you can begin to talk about God and ask him why he doesn't want God in his life. Talk to him about his problems and then slowly and gradually try to convince him that Jesus saves all. Well grace and peace to you and remember to tell him all the truth, not only what he wants to hear.|`|vx4QvCosaa	One can not make another  become something they choose not to. That is his choice. Everyone must find their own way.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	You already turned him down and decided he's not for you. Why don't you just leave well enough alone.    Question: Why do you feel a building has to be involved? Christianity can exist without a church, right?|`|AA11974194	Walk away, this way he will dislike you less.|`|QaT680QHaa	Love and accept who he is without trying to change or brainwash him|`|TPPZp8IYaa	You should never try to make someone become something they either don't want to be or simply aren't... I thought acceptance was key in good Christian values and society...if this person is good, decent and has morals, it shouldn't matter whether they are Christian or not... and people don't like to have other people's beliefs shoved down their throat, be it religion or politics...be yourself without trying to be a preacher.|`|AA10057370	No person can be forced to accept Jesus.  Romans 3:23,6:23  Romans 10  Just be careful you don't want to "convert" him so he will be OK to date.  I would recommend you have a male you have as a friend to witness to him (especially good if the friend knows him).|`|AA12059478	How about respecting his wishes and just letting it go?  He's made it plain he doesnt want to be witnessed to, so don't do it. It's rude.|`|Uj8icNHNaa	God isn't important.    Just cause you think so doesn't mean he has to.

It's something you believe in right?  He might be interested in knowing more.  But don't push.  Make sure it's the right time to talk about it.  And just have a casual conversation about beliefs and let him know how important it is to you and find out who he is.  Don't judge!|`|Ma10Exocaa	Do both of you a big favor and forget him.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	You are going to die alone and miserable.|`|TPdQBF2yaa	listen, the reason alot of people dont like christians is because the try to force their religion onto other people.

Already unhappy with a person, gotta make him over into your image of what you think he should be.    He should run from you.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	You can't make a smart person become a Christian.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Never, ever do that!  That's rude!

You'd have to choose whats more important him being your boyfriend or God in your relationship.|`|FmazIF6Maa	In my religion, proselytizing is immoral.     Why not take a hint and leave the guy alone.     He obviously knows about God and will believe what he believes.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	You can't only he can decide for himself. That is the work of Grace|`|YupMCYHlaa	You can't.  You can be friends with him only if you accept him as he is.  He is not in the world to measure up to your standards.    Jesus didn't do this.  When someone wasn't a believer, he wouldn't say 'Well, I won't talk to -you- then.'  He would talk to them, not preach to them.  He would answer questions they might have.  And he would try to help them in whatever way he could, to be an ambassador for his faith.  And that's just what you should do.    If you can't talk to him without preaching to him, then I think he's right--you -are- harsh.  If you absolutely don't want to have non-Christian friends, then I think he's better off without you anyway.  If you love him just as he is, be happy he's how he is, then you will be around him enough to see what kind of girl you are, and you might have an influence on him.  I've had Christian girlfriends and they had an influence on me.  Though, from their perspective, you might call the relationship a failure because they didn't convert me.|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	Dont focus on religion and church, its all about God and how Jesus died for everyone, if he has God and believes Jesus died for our sins, its ok, just pray for him and let The Lord do the rest|`|TTFadGjjaa	Hahaha. Wait, this ISN'T a joke? Just kidding I'm not stupid. Don't ever try to convert us people and seriously, he says he's a christian so just let it go. What if I wanted to talk to you about Odin or Zeus all the time. Sure, I think they're great but I won't go on and on about them. You are pushing him away because you are a fanatic. It's bad mojo. Let it go.|`|ykusYpp4aa	Joseph has the right idea. In the past (medieval times) persecuted people because they weren't Christians. I hope you disagree with that practice. And while turning someone down because they aren't Christian isn't as bad as burning someone at the stake, why does not being a Christian automatically make someone a bad person? That is essentially what you are saying by not giving him a chance. Some people with really great morals are not Christians or are not religious at all. You can't always try to change people when you don't agree with them.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	Leave him alone and back off he could take you to court for harrassment|`|TkPFp8vqaa	You do not have a relationship with him and yet you don't like something about him...not a good sign. Now, changes like the one you talk about, are changes that do not take place fast, it's a process that a person has to deal with patience. Now, I think that to mention the topic he obviously does not want to talk about, is not good at this point of "friendship". I think you should let it go for a while, if you really like him. Let it go and give him time to feel comfortable enough as one day tell you why he feels this way. But my experience tells him that he is not into religious topics as you are...so think about it, and make a balance, what's more strong...your beliefs in God, or whatever you feel for this person...you think about it and you choose. Good Luck!|`|7kJFmyxdaa	You can not make someone become a Christian. Accepting Jesus Christ is a personal choice. He has not made the choice yet. He does not want to talk about God so respect his wishes. But, you can pray to God to change his heart and to open his spiritual eye so that he will want to hear about God. But until God changes him, there really is not much you can do but pray for him to be changed.|`|ahBKJaVpaa	By being patient and waiting for the right time to talk about it.

If he's open, use your Bible and go through the Scriptures (Roman Road) with him.  Ask him if he wants to accept Jesus as his Savior.  Don't push him into any decisions, allow him to think things over and allow the Holy Spirit to work.  Be loving and patient.

Live and let live; stop forcing your personal beliefs onto another person. It's hypocritical, given that Christians are not supposed to force conversion on people. Ever heard of "live and let live"?    Only having strict Christian friends is damaging to your psyche. You need to get out in the world and broaden your horizons. And while you're at it, read the bible (or reread it if you already have, which I doubt) because you obviously didn't get the gist of what it was trying to say.|`|2c66a88eaa0f893daecc1b99138e7012aa	IMO you said you asked if he was a Christian and he said yes, sorta and when you asked why he didn't go he asked not to bring God into this?  He asked you not to BRING GOD into this? Dear heart, please know that any person that doesn't want to have God in "it" or anything for that matter isn't someone who you should even try to date.  My suggestion would be to invite him to some church activities, services and even ask your youth minister for suggestions.  What ever happens, I pray you don't copy his attitude just to be with him.|`|JTD3M8Ziaa	Leave him alone.|`|d7xE8bYFaa	He's lucky you turned him down.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	What does your god have to do with this?|`|ftoZ5Z53aa	GOD IS NOT REAL|`|0R4WGS8naa	stop trying so hard! if he doesn't want to talk about it why make him? why can't you be around some one who has different views? you can't convert those that don't want to be.|`|GGGmoyNeaa	Torture worked well for your creed in the past.|`|mCpWSayeaa	I don't think you should really judge him by Christianity, although I also kind of do, we have no right to judge one another. I think you should say yes to him but also try to get him into church. You can't force someone to convert, but God wants us to try and doesn't really care what the outcome is as long as we tried our best. I would say just take him to church and maybe ask him to convert, for you. Pray for him to change and try your best to show him the light of Jesus Christ. Good Luck!~|`|DR4LYQBtaa	You can't MAKE someone go to church or develop a relationship with God. I would say either--  1. You need to accept the fact that he doesn't go to church  OR  2.

I believe that you can worship god just the same from your house. honestly if he says he is a christian then he is a christian. I think the bare minimum of christian which is what I think of my self as is. you believe in god, jesus, and doing whats right. thats about all it takes to be a christian in my book. but if his religion affects you don't go out with him. but I suggest that you don't make it the only reason. hope this helps.|`|eomrfXrzaa	Congratulations, you just gave up on what could have been a fantastic relationship because you'd rather spend time with your imaginary friend.

7oCpSkmxaa	Here is an excerpt from a book titled "What Does The Bible Really Teach?"    You do not have to study and compare the teachings of all the many religions. You need only learn what the Bible really teaches about true worship. To illustrate: In many lands, there is a problem with counterfeit money. If you were given the job of picking out such false money, how would you go about it? By memorizing every kind of counterfeit? No. Your time would be better spent if you studied real money. After you knew what real money looked like, you could recognize a counterfeit. Similarly, when we learn how to identify the true religion, we can recognize those religions that are false.    Makes sense, right?  Learn what the BIBLE teaches, then you can identify which religions live up to it, and which don't.......|`|Ur53Pf6zaa	Put all books and bibles away.  Do not go into a church or religious building.  Ask the Creator God to tell you who He is, and what the truth is.   Then wait for answers that will come in undetermined time.  As you begin to search Him out, ask Him to put the truth into your heart when you hear it, see it, read it.  Men will give you their doctrines and traditions, so go straight to the God who created all things.  Pray, and ask for this often.

It smelled horrible, and the kid definitely didn't hold back in providing LOTS of sample to work with. :\      But, I got done around 12:30 and my supervisor let me leave for the rest of the day, so that was good.  Then I decided to go to Old Navy for a new pair of jeans since I'm losing a lot of weight on my new diet (yay!) but when I got there, they had none in my new size. :(    So I just got a few tee shirts instead.
4WqvTAfmaa	OK. I take personal exception to this concept. If you got pregnant, you dont get a free trial run. Why with adoption?    My brother and I were adopted. I am older. When he was about a year old, the doctor asked my parents if they knew there was rickets (vitamine c shortage=bowed legs) in his past. My mom mentioned this to the adoption people. To quote, the response was:    "Oh, we are sorry, Just bring him back and we will give you another one instead."    Now lets look at your statement. You want WHAT? A trial run? Maybe you should consider giving the poor child/baby the chance to run you through your paces before it accepts you as parents.

m4guclgYaa	Not necessarily.  What do you mean by love?  Is it love, or is it lust?  Is it an emotional attraction, or a physical attraction?  You must first differentiate what one is feeling.  It may be of God, it may not.  If you meet in a bar, it most likely is not of God, unless you are both praying to get out of that situation and the union between you and your spouse strengthens your relationship with God, and you no longer go to bars, etc.      If you are praying for the correct person to come into your life, and you fall in love and your relationship with God increases, then it was probably of God.  Anything God does in your life WILL strengthen your faith.  If God is not in it, your faith will not strengthen and may even decline - but this is not the "rule," because God can turn any evil or any mistake into something good, if there is faith.|`|grNWR5ppaa	Sometimes it's so; sometimes not.  Each person's relationship to God is far more important than his or her relationship to the other person.  Most unions based on this truth are blessed.

These unions uniformly fail.|`|Yxl3SQ6Laa	if their heart is with god almighty,then it is from the almighty.|`|XsTJPMHqaa	Not necessarily.
RdmRwv9iaa	Salvation: Assurance or Hope?    Are you saved?    --------------------------------------...    ...so that we might be justified by His grace, and become heirs in hope of eternal life.  Titus 3:7       --------------------------------------...    One day while going to Confession, I found a Protestant tract (pamphlet) wedged in the confessional screen. Its basic message was that we can be assured of our salvation as long as we believe in Christ. To paraphrase that tract, it argued that we can be assured of going to heaven, since God loves us (John 3:16). Even though we have sinned and are separated from God (Romans 3:23), Jesus Christ died for our sins (Romans 5:8). By repenting of our sins and receiving Christ into our heart, we are saved from hell (Acts 3:19; Rev. 3:20). That tract expressed several basic Christian truths, but it lacked the fullness of the Christian Faith. A few important points need to be clarified.    Let us begin with John 3:16...    For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. [John 3:16, RSV]    This verse is a concise yet beautiful statement of the Gospel message. God so loves us that He sent His only Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the Cross at the hands of sinful men in order to save us from hell (Romans 5:6-11). Our salvation is a free gift from God purchased by Christ. We cannot earn heaven least we boast (Ephesians 2:8). We are saved through Christ by believing in Christ. But what is "believing?"    Now John 3:16 is not a complete expression of the doctrine of salvation. We must understand it in the context and fullness of revelation. Only twenty verses later, it is also written:    He who believes (pisteuon) in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey (apeithon) the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him. [John 3:36]    The RSV, NAB and NASB Bibles translate the Greek verb, apeithon, as "obey." This verse connects "belief in Christ" with "obedience to Christ." Elsewhere St. Paul connects faith with obedience as in "the obedience of faith" [Romans 1:5] and with good works as in "faith working through love" [Galatians 5:6]. Also it is written, "By faith Abraham obeyed..." [Hebrew 11:8]. According to the Bible, "to believe" also means "to obey." We do not sincerely believe in Christ, if we disobey God's Commandments - i.e. commit sin (James 2:18-26). Sin is a break in faith (Numbers 5:6-7).    As a result of Adam's sin (Romans 5:12) and through our serious sins, we reject God and deserve hell - the loss of eternal life. It must be remembered that hell is not punishment from a vengeful God but the natural consequence of rejecting God - the Source of life and goodness. Our sins offend God's love. There is nothing we can do as finite (limited) creatures to repair this infinite (unlimited) offense. Fortunately due to God's mercy, Christ redeems us from hell through His Passion and Sacrifice on the Cross. As a free gift (Titus 3:5), God forgives us and offers us the grace to live with Him in friendship forever, beginning in the Sacrament of Baptism (Mark 16:16; 1 Peter 3:21; Acts 2:38). In the washing of Baptism, we receive Sanctifying Grace, which makes us right with God (Acts 22:16; 1 Cor 6:9-11).    Now we are surely redeemed by Christ in Baptism but we can freely choose to reject this gift through serious sin. As St. Paul writes:    For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. [Romans 6:23]    In this verse, eternal life is heaven, while death is hell - the opposite of eternal life. Heaven is a free gift from God, but we can still earn hell by committing serious sin (i.e. mortal sin). Obeying God's Law does not save us, but the Law does point to sins that can damn us (Romans 3:20). As an analogy, my civil liberties are a gift from my forefathers, but if I commit a felony, I may go to jail. Also in the Bible:    Make no mistake about this: no fornicator (those who have sex before marriage), no unclean or lustful person - in effect an idolater - has any inheritance in the kingdom (heaven) of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with worthless arguments. These are sins that bring God's wrath down on the disobedient.[Ephesians 5:5-6; NAB]    Another sobering verse from St. Paul is:    For if we deliberately sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful prospect of judgement. [Hebrews 10:26-27; RSV]    Please note that the "we" in this verse also included St. Paul - a faith-filled, baptized Christian! After Baptism if we sin deliberately and remain unrepentant, then we can lose the gift of salvation. In Baptism we receive Sanctifying Grace in our souls by no merit of our own, but afterwards we must cooperate with this grace or we will lose it (2 Cor 6:1). This cooperation with God's redeeming grace is the Catholic understanding of merit (CCC 162; 2025).    Fortunately God has given us the Sacrament of Confession (Penance or Reconciliation), so we can receive His continuing forgiveness for our sins committed after Baptism. Since we continue to sin after receiving Baptism (1 John 1:8-9), we must continually repent, confess our sins and turn our heart (will) back to Christ. Repentance is not a single event in our life, but must be an ongoing, everyday process for us. Yesterday we may have sincerely repented and been forgiven, but tomorrow through our weakness, we may stumble back into sin (2 Peter 2:20-22). We can be assured that Jesus will forgive us as often as we forgive others (Luke 6:36-37; Matt 6:14-15). Through this Sacrament, we receive Sanctifying Grace and Actual Graces which can help us resist future sins.    Jesus understands our weakness even after Baptism.

There are some Muslims who exploit and misuse this concept for their own political objectives. There are many non-Muslims who misunderstand it. There are some other non-Muslims who misinterpret it to discredit Islam and Muslims.    That is why the word 'Jihad' has been misused due to misunderstanding its true meaning. The word 'Jihad' is derived from the Arabic word jahd which means fatigue or from the word juhd which means effort. A mujahid is the one who strives in the Cause of Allah and exerts efforts which makes him feel fatigued. Jihad means exerting effort to achieve a desired thing or 'to prevent an undesired one. In other words, it is an effort that aims at bringing about benefit or preventing harm.    Jihad can be observed through any means and in any field whether material or moral. Among the types of Jihad are struggling against ones desires, Satan, poverty, illiteracy, and disease, and fighting all evil forces in the world.    There are many religious texts that refer to these types of Jihad. One of the forms of Jihad is defending life, property or honor. Those who die while engaging in Jihad are considered to be martyrs, as confirmed by Prophetic Hadiths. Jihad is also done to avert aggression on home countries and on all that is held sacred, or in order to face those who try to hinder the march of the call of truth."    Thus, Jihad is never a tool of waging war against the innocents. It is never a means of flexing the muscles or bullying the weak and oppressed. Jihad in Islam is something unique that is established to defend the divine message from being eliminated or hindered by its enemies.    Focusing on the question in point, the prominent Al-Azhar scholar Sheikh `Abdul-Majeed Subh states the following:    "I would like to tell you, dear son or dear daughter, who may share in the same belief or have his or her own, that understanding defensive Jihad as initiating fighting without a religiously acceptable reason is a total misunderstanding of the tenets of faith and the clear Qur'anic verses. In the Qur'an, defensive Jihad is under condition of repelling aggression, whereas preemptive Jihad is done only when the Muslim Ummah seriously expects a treason or an attack against its territories from an enemy.    Referring to this, Allah Almighty says: "Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you, but do not do aggression, for Allah loves not the aggressors. Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors. And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers. But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful. And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers." (Al-Baqarah 190-194)    Contemplating over the meanings and shades of the aforementioned verses that are best misused and misinterpreted by many non-Muslims, I can deduce the following:    1- The apparently preemptive Jihad in the first verse "Fight" is not an open call for all those who differ in creed. Rather, it is conditioned by " those who fight".    2-The phrase "And slay them wherever ye find them" in the second verse is conditioned by "but if they attack you"    3- The general rule that everyone should pay attention to along the line is that "Allah loves not the aggressors." And " But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrongdoers."    After the above explanation, I would like to add that Islam prohibits attacking those who do not fight. As I stated above, the preemptive war in Islam is only permitted when there is treason against Muslims from the enemy with whom they live in peace, or imminent attack against the Muslim territories. In such cases, Muslims are not supposed to stand hand-cuffed and wait to be slaughtered by others, although the war they are supposed to launch is not an aim in itself.    Having said this, I would like to classify war in Islam into three main categories:    1-Defensive War, which is resorted to when the enemies of Muslims attack the religion, honor, property, territories etc..    2-Liberating War, which is done to liberate all those who are oppressed, such as slaves. This form of war was normal in the early days of Islam.    3- Preemptive War, which is launched only when Muslims know for sure that there is treason against their peaceful treaties with the enemy, when the enemy has a serious plan to attack them.    It is worth stressing at the end that all the three kinds of war that are mentioned above are approved by international law, and they are in effect in modern laws."

Ill give you a few things to go on with this..  Its contents are scientifically sound on matters that human researchers discovered only at a later dat    Origin of the universe: Gen. 1:1 In the beginning god created the heavens and the earth  In 1978 astronomer Robert Jastrow wrote: now we see how the astronomical evidence leads to a biblical view of the origin of the world. The details differ but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accouts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time,in a flash of light and energy-God and the Astronomers (New York,1978),p.14    Shape of Planet Earth: Isa.40:22 : There is one who is dwelling above the circle of the earth" In ancient times the general opinion was that the earth was flat. Not until the 20th century has it been possible for humans to travel by airplane then into outer space and even to the moon thus giving them a clear view of "the circle" of earths horizon    Details of Human Anatomy: Job 19:20 I escape with the skin of my teeth" "on the enamel surface[of the teeth]is a highly indestructible pellicle [thin skin] or film indistinguishable to the naked eye known as the enamel cuticle (Nasmyths membrane) says the Encyclopedia Americana 1956 vol.xxvI p.321    Its internal harmony is significant  Tthis is especially so in view of the fact that the books of the Bible were recorded by some 40 men as diverse as king, prophet,herdsman,tax collector and physician. They did the writhing over a period of 1610 years so there was no opportunity for collusion. Yet their writings agree even in the smallest detail. To appreciate the extent to which the various portions of the Bible are harmoniously intertwined you must read and study it personally      all in all you do not need blind faith..|`|4f07f2a717240f59a97ac2c85778c9baaa	The signs of God:  Throughout people's lives,  from childhood until the time they die, signs of the one and only true God are shown to them in all regions of the earth and in thier own souls, until it becomes clear that there is only one true God. God says in the Qur'an:  "We will show them our signs in the furthest regions (of the earth) and in thier own  souls until it becomes clear to them that this is the truth" Surah Fussilat 41:53)  Also the story of Abraham's quest  for god is an example of how those who follow His (God's) signs will be rightly guided:  "So also did we show Abraham the power and the Laws of the heavens and the earth that he might (with understanding) have certitude. When the night covered him over, he saw a star. He said :'This is my Lord," but  when it set, he said, "I love not those that set." When he saw the moon rising in the splendour, he said, This is my Lord, but when the moon set, he said " Unless my Lord guide me, I shall be among those who go astray. .When se saw the sun rising in splendour, he said. " This is my Lord this is the greatest (of All) But when the sun set, he said, O my people! I am indeed free from your (guilt) of giving partner to God. For me, I have set my face firmly and truly, towards Him who created the heavens and the earth, and never shall I give partners to Allah. (Qur'an Al-An'aam 6:75-79)  The signs of God is all around. The seed that grows in to a tree shading us from the sun that rises to warm us, from the air we breath to the leaves that blow...all surrender themselves to the will of God Al-Mighty. The signs that your heart beats  many times a second, your lungs, kidney even your brain. living inside your body...signs. How the planet earth sitting in the solar system, the solar system is in the milkyway, which lies in the galaxy which is among many, does not conflict each  other, rotates...signs.God is responsible for all Praises.

Personally, I often find that evidence of a divine creator lies within the realm of science.  Consider the intricacy of the human body, and how harmoniously all the systems of the body work together.  Think about how proteins are created and how even a single imperfection in the formation of a protein can have a disastrous effect on the body.  Even when some problems occur, there are backup systems in the body to repair errors in DNA or to fight off infections.  It truly is amazing.  When a women breastfeeds, her milk provides the exact nutrients the baby needs, and as the baby grows the contents of breast milk also change to meet the baby's needs.  Nature is miraculous.

476b226836e04b1b989a6f0e289bdf77aa	Well, then, most notably, Christianity!    This is Christian dogma:    God created the world in 6 days, man from clay, woman from man's rib.  He placed these two in a garden, where they were tempted by a talking serpent into disobeying God by eating of the "Tree of Knowledge."  This "Original Sin" cursed not only this original man and woman, but all their progeny throughout eternity, the taint being passed via the semen to future generations.      Yet God, in His infinite mercy, nonetheless chose a certain "people" with whom He struck a covenant, which stipulated among other things that they regularly appease him with blood sacrifices in expiation of their "sins."      Eventually God decided to send His own Son to earth, so that his chosen could offer that Son back up to God as a sacrifice to end all sacrifices, thereby destroying the curse of Original Sin.  All that humanity from that point on has to do to be assured of "salvation" is to believe in and profess the efficacy of this final blood sacrifice to God.    "Christians" may complain about my tone, but everything that I've said is orthodox Christian doctrine straight out of the box.    Pretty sick stuff, huh?    "The Christian God is not involved in infantcide as others have stated."    Only the most ignorant and/or disingenuous of Christian imbeciles would have the audacity to make such a mind-numbingly false statement.  Aside from the designation of His Son as a sacrifice to His own bloodthirst - what about God's massacre of the Egyptian firstborn in response to the similar edict of Pharaoh with regard to the Hebrew firstborn?  Is God off the hook because this was "revenge infanticide?"  After all, He "hardened Pharaoh's heart" Himself purely to be assured of the outcome!|`|3a705bf0321bf4809136d6a880ae5862aa	Again, you're going to say Christianity/Judiasim.

He never intended Isaac to die on the altar, he was testing to see how much Abraham trusted Him.  He obviously stopped him before he did it, so that proves it was never His intent.  He provided a ram instead of the son.|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	A number of religions of ancient time had this feature. The one which remains which is founded on the notion of a god appeased by infanticide is of course Christianity. But since Trinitarianism tells us Jesus and the Father are one, you could also say it's based in parricide. And since Jesus said, "No man takes my life from me, but I lay it down," you could also say it's based in suicide.    Whichever way you put it, Yahweh is a god who from the OT through the NT is appeased by blood sacrifice. It's a barbaric and neanderthalic theology any way you look at, which is probably why it's most literal adherents are so intent on dragging us back to the caves.     "Geico -so easy a Yahweh worshipper could do it."|`|fec49e6bf093ae87a74edbdbe587ff5daa	I'm assuming you mean Christianity and/or Judaism.   In Genesis 22, God orders Abraham to sacrifice his son.

Sosiega tu espiritu, calmalo. Jesucristo fund una sola Iglesia, nacida en el Pentecostes y quizo que fuese una sola y no miles, como la de los hermanos saparado que hay ahora. Jesus es Dios, no catolico. La "titulacion" de Catolico nacio posteriormente en ese nacimiento, con los Apostoles.  Hacer que  la Palabra de Dios fuese universal, es decir, Catolica. Eso es lo que significa Catolica, universal. "Vayan por todos los pueblos anunciando la Palabra y Bautizandolos en el nombre del Padre, del Hijo y del Espiritu Santo". Un mandato que se cumple aun, incluyendo a los hermanos separados. Creemos profundamente en los Sacramentos, en especial en la Eucaristia: "YO SOY el Pan de vida"; "Hagan esto en mi memoria".    Te hago una correccion fraterna, querido mio: guardate los improperios. No insultes, pues es una pagina de libre expresion y no una manifestacion de intolerancia o de bronca. Demasiado tenemos cuando se nos critican. Paz en el Jesus de la tolerancia.

Las siglas sobre la cruz donde fue crucificado (INRI) quieren decir:  Jess de Nazaret, rey de los JUDIOS!!!    La religin catlica fue creada porterior a la muerte de Jess, entiendo que por sus seguidores.    Dices que era catlico por adorar a Maria... ERA SU MADRE!!!  cmo no iba a adorarla... a caso no adoras t a tu madre????  La eucarista se creo despus de la muerte de Jess  copiando su ritual de la ltima cena.    No nombro a nadie como papa... slo le dijo a pedro que se encargara de difundir su "palabra" cuando el muriera.

Yo creo que la respuesta es "No". No existe una "religin verdadera" (aunque ya me imagino las respuestas que algunos me darn...)    Ojo: Esto no significa que no exista un Dios (o varios, segn); simplemente, que no hay una "religin verdadera" ;-).    Vers, los judos creen que son el pueblo elegido por YHVH. Los catlicos/cristianos, creen que Jess vino para "salvarnos". Los musulmanes, que Al es Dios y que Mahoma es su profeta. Los Wiccanos veneran al Dios y la Diosa. Los Hindustas, entre su multitud de dioses, esperan llegar a Brahma algn da.    ...Eso por citar algunos ejemplos. Todos, sea por cultura o por creencia personal, van a decir que su religin es la verdadera. Y es lgico! Es lo que nos han ense?ado ;-). No tendra sentido tomar como verdadero algo que no crees o que supones falso.    Pero yo me quedo pensando... ?quien es uno para negar o -peor an- discriminar la fe del resto del mundo? An las religiones cristiano-catlicas, siendo la corriente religiosa mayoritaria del mundo, no son ni el 20% de la poblacin mundial! ?Cmo pueden decir que su religin es la verdadera cuando hay un 83% que no piensa lo mismo? (y eso que no estoy contando a los catlicos no practicantes).    En ms de 6000 a?os, no hay una fe que por s sola y por su propio mrito haya conseguido a ms del 50% de la poblacin del mundo siquiera. Por ende, yo creo que no hay una religin verdadera.    Y por ltimo, si Dios (como sea que le concibas) nos hizo libres de ser y de pensar... ?por qu no nos hara libres de escoger el camino para acercarnos a l? Hay tantas religiones verdaderas como fe de personas en el planeta.

La religin nace de lo que una persona cree, por ejemplo: Nuestro planeta existe desde hace varios miles de millones de a?os, al principio adoraban varios dioses; hace dos mil a?os aproximadamente se inculco a algunas generaciones que Jesucristo es el hijo de Dios y nacio el Cristianismo, sin embargo a otras generaciones se les inculco el Budismo, y a otras Mahoma, pero al final todo es consecuencia de una influencia de nuestros antepasados o en nuestro caso en Amrica por la conquista de los Espa?oles quienes introdujeron la Fe Catlica, religion que predomina.|`|2myPey21aa	Ninguna es verdadera.

eR7xWgi4aa	Opino que las dos estan llenas de falsas doctrinas y en las dos minimizan el sacrificio de Cristo.  En la catolica aceptan a Cristo como Dios , pero dicen que la Virgen Maria tambien es un puente para llegar al cielo y los santos interceden tambien, entonces pues porque no Dios solo puso a Maria en vez de morir Cristo, no creen , nos dicen gracias a que Maria nos dio a Jesus podemos ser salvos, y la biblia no dice que Maria nos lo dio , dice de tal manera amo DIOS al mundo que para todo aquel que en EL cree no se pierda mas tenga vida eterna.  nunca menciona que maria nos lo dio.    y en los testigos bueno pues aceptan a Jesus solo como creacion de Dios no como Dios como hijo pero creado no engendrado, y eso es falso, Cristo es Dios , dicen que resucito pero solo su espiritu y esoes mentira resucito en cuerpo y alma.

Ojo, la mayora, no todos. Los Testigo de Jehov, pues... ellos s practican su doctrina, pero lo malo que tienen es que son primitivos, si es que as se les puede llamar, ya que he sabido de muchos casos en que uno de sus integrantes necesitaba transplante de rganos o transfusin de sangre y ellos simplemente se oponen, porque segn su religin, es prohibido; dejando morir a los suyos, los cuales incluso estn de acuerdo con esto.     Las religiones se han originado en el mundo con el propsito de dominar el mundo, de implantar miedo. Lo que debera seguirse, practicarse, profesarse en todo caso, es una doctrina.

Por otro lado; Los testigos de Jehova, se inician como una congregacion cristiana liderada por un ministro apellidado Thompson que agrego conceptos y/o le dio una interpretacion diferente a la Biblia, hasta llegar al punto de traducirla convenientemente,y escribir una nueva edicion llamada del Nuevo Mundo; Pero lo mas triste es que este llego a comercializar con la fe de las personas, como la venta de la "Semilla de la Prosperidad", por lo que fue denunciado, juzgado y sentenciado en su tiempo por estafa ante las autoridades correspondientes.  Sin embargo reconoceria que hay testigos Integros, que han vivido para hacer lo que es bueno y de buen nombre.  En conclusion, no existe una comunidad religiosa perfecta, todas han cometido sus errores, y eso es razonable, pues la gente es imperfecta, dentro de cada comunidad se pueden apreciar ejemplares de lo bueno y de lo malo, y cuando Dios decida poner fin a este sistema, solo el podra separar el trigo de la ciza?a.

(Juan 4:23)      Estas palabras de Cristo constituyen un reto. Declaran que Dios se complace solamente en la adoracin de aquellos que se le acercan "en espritu y en verdad." Implican que los verdaderos adoradores son nicamente los que estn dispuestos a buscar la verdad de Dios, a fin de convertirla en el fundamento de su vida espiritual.   Muchos reconocern el derecho de Dios de dictar las condiciones de la adoracin. Aun las autoridades humanas hacen lo mismo con respecto a s mismas. Nadie pensara acercarse a un monarca terrenal sin respetar las convenciones requeridas, y si no las conociera, dara los pasos necesarios para averiguarlas.   ?Se tratar con menos respeto a Dios, quien es ms alto que cualquier monarca terrenal?   ?De ningn modo! Las palabras de Cristo, citadas anteriormente, revelan que Dios desea que los verdaderos adoradores vengan a un correcto conocimiento de El como una base para una adoracin aceptable. Esto impone una solemne responsabilidad sobre el que desea agradarlo, es decir, la de buscar cuidadosamente la revelacin que El ha dado de s mismo (la Biblia) si su deseo es conocerlo.   Pero algunos preguntarn: Si nuestras intenciones son correctas, ?pueden tener importancia simples trminos doctrinales?   La mayora contestara negativamente. Pero las palabras de Cristo revelan que la verdad doctrinal es vital para la salvacin. Despus de todo, ?puede uno adorar a Dios si carece del entendimiento bsico de su esencia divina?   No. No puede haber componenda ni concesiones en este tema tan importante. Dios se ha revelado a s mismo y ha revelado su propsito en la Biblia, y es nuestro deber y privilegio escudri?ar ese maravilloso libro para conocer al Dios a quien adoramos. Rechazar la Biblia convertira nuestra adoracin en vana e intil.   Un conocimiento correcto de Dios es esencial para la salvacin  En varias ocasiones, Cristo revel que la salvacin depende del correcto entendimiento de la verdad divina (Marcos 16:16; Romanos 1:16; 1 Corintios 15:2,3; etc.). Orando al Padre, declar:   "Y esta es la vida eterna: que te conozcan a ti, el nico Dios verdadero, y a Jesucristo, a quien has enviado." (Juan 17:3)    ?Hasta qu grado conocemos a Dios? ?Concuerda nuestro entendimiento con la verdad bblica?   Dos ideas opuestas respecto de Dios son ense?adas en la cristiandad. La mayora de iglesias ense?an que El es un ser trino, constituido por el Padre, el Hijo y el Espritu Santo: uno aunque tres, iguales en conocimiento, poder y esencia, desde la eternidad y hasta la eternidad.   Por otra parte, algunos declaramos que la doctrina de la Trinidad es falsa; que Dios es uno y solo; que Jesucristo es Su Hijo, nacido hace 1900 a?os, antes de lo cual no tena existencia personal; y que el Espritu Santo es el poder de Dios.     Ambas doctrinas no pueden ser correctas al mismo tiempo, y a la luz de las declaraciones del Se?or, expuestas anteriormente, aquellos que estn en error no estn en el camino de la vida eterna, no importa cun sinceros sean.     Esta es una afirmacin muy seria, y a muchos no les agrada que lo digamos en forma tan cortante. En realidad, muchos consideran indigna cualquier discusin acerca de Dios. Creen que es innecesaria y prefieren dejar tales problemas a los telogos, a quienes consideran profesionalmente preparados para resolverlos.   Pero si las palabras de Cristo significan algo, ense?an que la salvacin eterna est condicionada a que una persona adore a Dios en verdad.   Por consiguiente, el lector de la Biblia debe decidir si su salvacin personal vale tanto como para tomarse el trabajo y el tiempo de investigar el asunto.     La Trinidad es un concepto contradictorio  Muchos sistemas religiosos afirman creer en lo que ellos llaman Trinidad. Exponen la doctrina de que Dios es al mismo tiempo uno y tres, y est compuesto por Padre, Hijo y Espritu Santo. Esta doctrina no ha sido extrada de la Biblia (donde el trmino Trinidad jams aparece), sino de lo que se conoce como el Credo de Atanasio, que fue presentado por Atanasio, Obispo de Alejandra, en el siglo cuarto despus de Cristo. En l se define la divinidad como sigue:   "El Padre es Dios, El Hijo es Dios, y el Espritu Santo es Dios. Aun as no son tres Dioses, sino un Dios."    La Trinidad es adems definida as:     "Solamente hay un Dios viviente, verdadero y eterno; sin cuerpo, partes o pasiones; de infinito poder, sabidura y bondad; El Hacedor y Preservador de todas las cosas, tanto visibles como invisibles. En la unidad de esta Divinidad existen tres personas, de una sustancia, poder y eternidad: el Padre, el Hijo, y el Espritu Santo."        Un anlisis cuidadoso de esa definicin revelar contradiccin y confusin.     Por ejemplo, ?cmo puede un solo Dios ser tres personas? ?Como pudo ser engendrado el Hijo (Salmos 2:7) y an existir desde la eternidad?     En pocas palabras, creer en lo que la mayora de las iglesias ense?an acerca de la divinidad, es creer en una contradiccin imposible.   Pablo ense? que "Dios no es Dios de confusin" (1 Corintios 14:33); pero la doctrina que ense?a que Dios es al mismo tiempo uno y tres es un obvio error de confusin.     Comprubelo usted misma. Pregunte a cualquier clrigo cmo Dios puede ser al mismo tiempo tres y uno; cmo puede ser "sin cuerpo, partes y pasiones," y sin embargo ser "una substancia"; cmo el Hijo puede existir desde toda la eternidad, y aun as, al mismo tiempo, ser "el unignito hijo de Dios" (Juan 1:18).   Le responder que es un "misterio" ms all del alcance del entendimiento de la humanidad. A lo mejor le amonestar|`|LMUB7Mh0aa	Cristo salva personas, no ramas.    En algunos casos, se salvan a pesar de, no gracias a; los Testigos de Jehov estn condenados al infierno por centenares de razones, ya que niegan su ser personal al Espritu Santo, y eso es pecado contra el Espritu; modifican la Biblia, y eso los hace merecedores de todas las plagas del Apocalipsis.  Para saber cmo les va a los islmicos y Mormones, chcate la intro de la carta a los glatas.    El Verbo Divino es la luz que ilumina a todo hombre que viene a este mundo, porque Dios quiere que todos se salven (Juan 1,9).    De tal suerte, el pagano que sinceramente busca a Dios es salvado por el nico Salvador   Romanos 2:  6 Dios = dar a cada cual segn sus obras: =  7 a los que, por la perseverancia en el bien busquen gloria, honor e inmortalidad: vida eterna;  8 mas a los rebeldes, indciles a la verdad y dciles a la injusticia: clera e indignacin.  9 Tribulacin y angustia sobre toda alma humana que obre el mal: del judo primeramente y tambin del griego;  10 en cambio, gloria, honor y paz a todo el que obre el bien; al judo primeramente y tambin al griego;  11 que no hay acepcin de personas en Dios.  12 Pues cuantos sin ley pecaron, sin ley tambin perecern; y cuantos pecaron bajo la ley, por la ley sern juzgados;  13 que no son justos delante de Dios los que oyen la ley, sino los que la cumplen: sos sern justificados.  14 En efecto, cuando los gentiles, que no tienen ley, cumplen naturalmente las prescripciones de la ley, sin tener ley, para s mismos son ley;  15 como quienes muestran tener la realidad de esa ley escrita en su corazn, atestigundolo su conciencia, y los juicios  contrapuestos de condenacin o alabanza...     Distinta es la suerte de quienes reciben el evangelio y lo rechazan:  Marcos 16  15 Y les dijo: ?Id por todo el mundo y proclamad la Buena Nueva a toda la creacin.  16 El que crea y sea bautizado, se salvar; el que no crea, se condenar.     El nico salvador disponible es el Se?or Jesucristo.  Si no te salva l, no hay nadie ms.  Qu pena por los hindes que rechazan explcita y belicosamente el cristianismo.

La iglesia catolica pone a la mujer como una prostituta al servicio del hombre que no tiene ningun derecho o hemos visto alguna sacerdotisa reconocida por el vaticano, claro que no las unicas que fueron ordenadas por un obizpo inmediatamente fueron excomulgadas por juan pablo segundo, la vdd dios es otra cosa con la que la iglesia catolica lucra, bueno no solo la catolica pero si es la que mas ha ganado con la venta de dios,ademas en el caso de mexico siento que no hay memoria historia puesto que la religion catolica fue implantada aqui a base de muerte y abusos jaja pero es no se ve, y con respecto a lo que pone alysha (perdon si me equivoque pero solo lo vi de reojo) en que muchos padres si ayudan es obvio que si claro hay gente que ayuda, pero al igual como hay gente buena hay gente mala, como hay policias corruptos los hay honestos y asi hay una lista interminable, obvio yo no critico a todos por igual por eso procure escribir diciendo "la mayoria"y si alguna vez yo le pedi ayuda a "dios" aunque no directamente se lo fui a pedir a uno de sus representantes segun la iglesia y me mando literalmente a recordar a mi madres, de ahi jamas volvere a pedirle nada a la iglesia catolica y tampoco a dios puesto que yo no creo en nada aunque lo respeto, pero eso es solo mi opinion espero no ofender a muchas personas con lo que escribo alguna queja o alguien que comparte mi creencia pacogokdian@msn.com la unica iglesia que ilumina es la que arde "mago de oz"|`|mwVHo0K0aa	Muy bueno tu cuestionamiento, amigo viento.

Gracias a ella, viv mi ni?ez creyendo una sarta de tonteras que, por mi inmadurez infantil, no me atreva a poner en tela de juicio. La misma iglesia es la base de la plataforma moral sobre la que descansan mis actos. Esa moral estuvo limitando la capacidad de mi razonamiento durante mucho tiempo, hasta que decid dar un paso ms all...  An desligado ideolgicamente de la iglesia, sigue afectando mi vida... ?cmo?, pues en mi contacto diario con la sociedad afectada por el mismo mal, el bache de dogmas donde est atascada. La iglesia se mete en los asuntos de gobierno (al menos en Mxico, mi pas) que al final afectan a todos los ciudadanos, profesen o no religin alguna, crean en algn dios o no.    El activismo ateo tiene como fin una causa noble, de concientizacin social acerca del problema que implica la ausencia de razonamiento.

cSruGjNwaa	Gracias por su apoyo a nuestras creencias, pero creo debemos tratar con repeto a todas las demas personas an cuando no compartan nuestra fe ni nuestras creenciaspor supuesto que la Biblia no concuerda con el punto de vista moderno de que haya muchas maneras aceptables de adorar a Dios. Efesios 4:5 dice que hay un Se?or, una fe. Jess declar: Angosta es la puerta y estrecho el camino que conduce a la vida, y pocos son los que la hallan.?No todo el que me dice: Se?or, Se?or, entrar en el reino de los cielos, sino el que hace la voluntad de mi Padre que est en los cielos. (Mat. 7:13, 14, 21; 1?Corintios 1:10.)    Pero debemos usar tacto y perspicacia al compartir nuestras creencias con las demas personas. La razn principal es que representamos al nico Dios verdadero y debemos hacerlo de una manera digna, es decir que no se manche su santo Nombre, puesto que los testigos de Jehov basamos todas nuestras creencias, normas de conducta y procedimientos de organizacin en la Biblia, la fe que tienemos en la Biblia misma como la Palabra de Dios nos da la conviccin de que lo que poseemos ciertamente es la verdad. Pero nuestra postura o posicin nunca es egosta, sino que demostarmos la confianza que tienemos en que la Biblia es la norma correcta con la cual se debe medir la religin que uno practique. Tampoco somos egocntricos, sino que estamos deseosos de compartir con otras personas nuestras creencias, pero siempre con el debido respeto, solo le expreso mi humilde opinion como Testigo de Jehov que soy.      Dont worry be happy|`|x7RhBT06aa	Un tipo que creia que Dios vivia en Saturno...    Un tipo que disque invento una maquina que curaba todas las Enfermedades...    Un tipo que pronostico el fin del mundo en 1970.. y claro se juntaron miles de personas en un estadio agarrados de las manos creyendo que ustedes hiban a ir al cielo..    Una organizacion que cambia y cambia todo lo que viene diciendo desde hace mas de 100 a?os    Imagenes subliminales en las publicaciones....      No pues claro... claro que ustedes son la mejor opcion...|`|1A4gpPDCaa	no me parece, tu no eres ni de ninguna religin por que lo primero que haces es ofender a las dems personas, no digo que los testigos de jehov sean malos pero muchooooooo aburren que todos los domingos salgan hablar de Dios uno no es ignorante, y no importa a que religin le vas si no que obedescas su palabra|`|01xNzaNkaa	La verdad, en cierta forma tienes razon, pues entre los Testigos de Jehova se cultivan muchas costumbres sanas que hoy en dia nos hacen mucha falta, y que en otras religiones, sus feligreses, simplemente no se les da importancia, yo soy catolico y veo demasiada conchudez entre la gente que convive en esta religion, sin embargo yo si intento llevar a mi familia por el camino de la correcion, respetando a nuestros semejantes como buenos cristianos y buenos ciudadanos.

Si uno se muestra a favor de una sola opcin e ignora todo lo dems, uno refleja una postura limitada del conocimiento del mundo. La religin, credo, creencia, etc, debe surgir del interior de la persona, no del exterior como usted afirma.

Ademas no se por que digan que son doctrinas contrarias a las de Dios....denme una prueba  No creo que se prohioban ellos nada, simplemente se basan en la biblia...  Pues no es cierto que la biblia prohibe adorar imagenes, y lo dijo Dios en Deuteronomio...Ah es que a los catolicos les gusta hacer caso omiso verdad...asi como tambien celebrar dias de fiesta paganos, digo por que sino en que parte de la biblia dice que Jesus nacioel 25 de Dic?

En donde dice que todos iremos al cielo?  O que se deben de bautizar a los bebe?  En que evangelio dice que Pedro debia ser sucesor de Cristo y que se estableciera en Roma?  Seguro que eso quiso decir al decir que era la oiedra angular?  Por que no han ido a mi casa a tocar la puerta y hablar de Dios? Por que, si ese es un mandato de Jesus, y segun ustedes los papas son sucesores de el no? Por que se meten en politica, por que los papas apoyaron las guerras mundiales, y lo que es peor apoyar a un lider tan malo como Hitler, por que matar en guerras, segun ustedes santas?

Some have proof (like me) and most don't need it. I believe in God because I have been blessed and the blessing could only come from him. This is a true stroy and it will amaze you so read it please.     My family got a message from a pastor that he'd prayed for us and was told by God himself that My family was in danger. He wat told that someone in my family was at risk of premature death. It was me. I was in a car accident back in May of this year. My girlfriend died right next to me. I barely survived the night in trauma. The doctors still keep in touch with me and keep on swearing that they are so shocked that lived. They say that when I came into the hospital on the stretcher, they had NO hope for me. they thought I was a gonner.     I miraculously pulled through. My family brought the same pastors into my hospital room to pray over me. they got a promise that I would make a 100% recovery. Today I am 100% recovered.       They said that they saw how bad the accident was and they thought I'd die that night for sure. Here I am. I walk and talk just fine.      Want another story?   Since I made it out of the hospital I have encountered many problems getting along with normal life. I lost my home because it was in my gf's name, I used to drive my gf's car but that's destroyed now. I can't find work since my job let me go when they heard I might not pull through. I have no job, no car, I just rented a place to live in September with my disability money but now that's all been expended. I was going to therapy but now my insurance has run out.   Yesterday I got hired into a great new job, I can pay rent. A week ago I applied for medicaid and got it. But this gets better.    My rent is due Dec. 1st and until yesterday I thought I was going to end up a bum on the streets. I ran out of food. My rent is due.  about 3 days ago, I was starving and depressed because I couldn'r seem to get hired anywhere. (I applied to over 9-15 places). I was discouraged, staving, and broke. I began praying to God for his help and mercy. 3 days ago, I knew I had 2 five dollar bills and 3 ones. I knew that was the last of my money. I planned on shopping for food with it, but realized I couldn't because I reached into my pockets and pulled out 4 ones and no fives. I didn't remember ever ever spending it. so I went from $13 to only $4 to buy food with. I went outside to check my pockets once more but found nothing other than the $4. I kept praying. then I checked my wallet even though I knew there was nothing in it. I found $60 and screamed Thank You Jesus!!!! I am still living on that $60 right now. And yesterday I got hired. I am going to be OK because of God. THAT was a miracle. you can believe it or not, but nobody has been in my wallet for weeks and I check it all the time. no one left me anygenerous gifts. I asked everyone I know twice! God will take care of his believers if they only ask with all their hearts and have faith in Him. So I know it was alot to read but it was alot to type up too. Ans YES God exists and I believe in Him. so should you. Hew obviously has a plan for my life.     Oh, and for Mildred, I DID leave the faith for only long enough to learn about all other beliefs. It only strengthened my faith in Him.

I'm not religious by ANY means. I believe religion was created by man.

God speaks to me in Sunsets, Rain, the Ocean, Rainbows, Friends, Family. God is always there to listen when I need a friend...

I was discharged from the hospital and went on to a University and earned two degrees in English. I believe that God does miracles every day. There is no limit to what God can do. I believe that God loves us and will also heal our pet cat or dog too. There is no limit to our God's love. You can look at a rainbow or a flower or a sunrise or a sunset.

If churches follow your bible quote to the letter, women shouldn't sing in the choir or teach Sunday school, either.    It is vital to understand the social mores of the time the Bible's various books were written.  Women were once considered property, but not anymore (at least in my culture).  When social customs change, as in this case, certain parts of scripture become irrelevant.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	No dear. it doesnt matter if its a man, woman or a lesser spotted pink reed warbler thats doing the preaching, I dont believe in any of it and thats that.

This is the how and why so many people do not attend church, fall away from the church and look at people, instead of looking at what Christ did for all.|`|B424kmXoaa	yes , just out of curiosity , that would be cool actually .
C1SOqQSkaa	It sounds as though the hospital escalated this out of all proportion. I don't believe that the nurse should have taken the opportunity to flaunt her piety, but at worst her behaviour was insensitive and prideful.    I note that her 'suspension' in this case is simply a situation in which she - effectively a temp staff-member - will not be used until the investigation is complete. She's really a freelance, and the hospital doesn't owe her a job.    Hopefully she'll be reinstated after the investigation, and won't do it again. Anything else would be pretty harsh unless she's been guilty of other offences.    EDIT: Ah - there is more to the affair: check out the statement at the Care Trust website:    http://www.northsomerset.nhs.uk/default....|`|283tO9j9aa	Well if she just accepted that the patient said no then what's the problem? You can't tell that the nurse is specifically Christian unless she says so, so there's no need for anyone to be offended. A simple 'no thanks' and a smile is enough. She wasn't hurting anyone, if people are really that offended she could just be asked to stop offering prayer. I'm sure if it had been handled like that the nurse would have just stopped asking.    I'm an atheist by the way.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	I find such prayer offers irritating because they are all about the person praying and not the patient, but suspension was too much.|`|GGUDvicaaa	If she just said "Can I pray for you?" and nothing nasty, well, this atheist thinks she just meant well.|`|6093550b9308429b874e5a267fb27439aa	Interesting question.    There are many religions, including idolatrous ones, whose members I would not want praying for me.    If the nurse knows that the patient is the same religion, then there should be no problem.    In any event suspension was unwarranted.    A warning was sufficient.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	This is stupid.  Apparently no one was offended: ""The woman mentioned it to the sister who did her dressing the following day. She said that she wasn't offended but was concerned that someone else might be. "    The trustees should be suspended for religious intolerance.|`|U8yovU7yaa	i cant believe some people actually agree she should have been suspended. Yes she's a professional and probably very good at the job she does (or did), and i bet she's been on the opposing end of comments from patients that are very offensive to her (maybe you've seen the staff abuse posters) and humbly carried on with her duties.     This woman meant no offense when she offered prayer, only love and compassion not to mention carrying out the will of our creator!    The world has gone mad with political correctness, if you are in hospital being cared for and treated then be grateful!!. People do get paid but its much more than "a job" its a gift not many people have. You don't get taught at nursing school to be caring.      The person who complained about this and the person responsible for her suspension should be ashamed of themselves.    This person obviously was one of the bed hogging NHS time wasters!|`|AA11521494	Suspension seems an over-reaction to ONE incident of merely ASKING if she could pray.  However, society has got to the stage where anything at all about religion scares government, employers etc so much they tend to over-react.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	It was not an insult! Even non-believers are usually pleased to have someone offer to pray for them when they are ill in hospital. Even if they don't believe, it will do them no harm. I bet there would have been no fuss if she had offered to turn a muslim's bed towards the east. I'm tired of the way things are going in this country.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	This was not the first time she had been warned about it.  She is a Baptist and had previously been handing out prayer cards.    I get the feeling that it was felt she was a little to fervent in her efforts to want to pray for the patients.    Maybe a 2nd warning would have been more appropriate, with the threat of suspension if she did it again.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	I bet there is more to this issue or situation than the article lets on. They do not just suspend nurses for friendly prayer offers.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	If the patient complained and the nurse prayed for him anyway, then the suspension was justified.  If the nurse listened to the complaint and left without praying, then it was not.|`|WZa6GhS3aa	She should not have been suspended   because of her beliefs only if she harassed them kept asking to pray for them when they said no clearly but if you gave them the option it isn't fair to be suspended|`|d265DZbHaa	No - she has her beliefs, they should not get in the way of her work so a little word would have been sensible by suspension - no.|`|lnsNN93oaa	Yes cuz she should have asked the patient if they were a believer or not and find out which religion she observed or not.|`|KT7cllsLaa	She is a nurse  so  she should stay professional  If someone needs a prayer i suppose, they would ask for one|`|OD3FqMaKaa	absolutely ridiculous suspending an obviously caring nurse    i am an atheist but i wouldnt find it insulting if someone asked if they could say a prayer for me, each to their own    hopefully the nhs trust will reinstate her soon, doubtless with the proviso that she doesnt offer to pray for anyone again|`|RCn1Y3Ogaa	I think the old woman was too religious to her faith.    the Nice nurse was only trying to be nice...    -  But truthfully, there must be something more in this fiasco...|`|AA10283947	Obviously WE do not have the freedoms we think we have here in the UK, it is perhaps a good time to press home the point that we really do need a WRITTEN CONSTITUTION, not leave the like of this silly decision to the minor gods in power.  This nurse simply asked whether the lady would like a prayer said for her recovery, and if the full report is true, the lady should have simply declined the offer or said firmly no! leaving the matter there.  However if there has been a twist to the story, then maybe the people in charge should not have even considered a complaint unless of course the lady concerned was bullied with overly soliticous requests.  Our world has gone absolutely mad with people not being allowed to go about their business without some nerdy jobsworth creating fresh havoc time after time on what is after all just another of life's trivialities.|`|hceNM6Uxaa	I do think she deserved suspension.  If you are in a position of trust, as any nurse, doctor, teacher, etc is, then to go outside the context of your work and make comments concerning religion, politics, sexuality or anything else is inappropriate.  The fiduciary relationship (a relationship based on trust) demands that the person put aside their personal beliefs and attitudes in order to fulfil the role for which they are employed.  It is offensive to assume that your own beliefs, however sincere, are acceptable to other people and to attempt to engage them with those beliefs.|`|6OXcyrtCaa	Some people r so Picky..she was asked a question,she said no thanks..so wots her problem..if i was a nurse and saw people suffering i'd ask the same question..some people r so up there own doda..LOL!!!...stupid,the old lady properly thinks she will get compo for her traumatic experience..yeah right.....|`|L2V0ur7Haa	No, it's ridicules suspending someone for offering to pray for someone else, such an act would offer some people comfort, and what does it matter to those that don't believe?|`|78Xb7enMaa	I think suspension is a bit harsh. Whilst I choose not to believe and won't tolerate proselytising this is a Christian country and people should not be 'offended' by Christians. The patient herself said she wasn't offended but was worried others might be. It's a bit silly to worry about what might happen since it also might not. She should have had a disciplinary interview with her boss and told not to offer to pray or mention religion to patients. The matter could have ended there.|`|0MnKRNseaa	Maybe suspension is a little harsh, but she definitely needs to be spoken to by her managers. As a nurse, she has professional standards to keep up. She is paid to nurse sick patients, not to proselytise about her wretched religion, whatever that religion may be.    Personally I would have been offended and deeply annoyed I had been the patient.|`|AA11182714	I think that's just stupid.  If the nurse nagged the woman about it, that would be one thing, but offering to pray for her?  Not worth getting suspended over.  It's absurd.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	I don't know all the details of this situation, but I'd like to believe that the nurse acted with the best of intentions and meant no harm.  I also get it that she may have offended at least one patient, and hopefully the nurse will learn from her experience.  That being said, do we really need to punish this woman for her naive attempt to do something nice?

In case people are missing it the UK adopted human rights which protects peoples right to believe and worship as they wish and that means also that people have the right not to be christian and not to have it thrust at them!!    It so happen that my wife is seriously ill at the moment and if the same thing was said to her I would object in the strongest terms!!    She is paid as a nurse not a preacher and as a nurse she should be sensitive to the patients needs not her own!!!|`|pfdIK6Opaa	Ha that's stupid.

Look what happens to priests when their natural desire is suppressed.  The male/female equal exchange of energy is right in the eyes of God, it is man who has corrupted this idea.  It is also wrong to abuse this energy.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I don't know and I don't think so.|`|AA11990031	Yes. Some say that man becomes a saint when he attains mastery of his sexual energies.

(well, maybe not- old people drive slow enough...)|`|AA11676104	NO, NEVER.    It shall be within limit.    It helps in no way to understand the Spiritual line.    You need certain restraint on all things, food habits, food items you eat, the sleeping habits, reading habits and the material you read, the people you meet and the things you discuss... all have an effect on the Spiritual Progress.|`|b22cb5ae8631e04ecb2c69931edcac67aa	Energy  is just plain ENERGY  there are no categories of 'energy'  it depends on the individual  and the control that he/she can  exercise on energy  to channelize it   for a given purpose, goal or achievement  yes  its easier to experience it on the worldly   rather than the spiritual level|`|biFCKGAcaa	Many yogis talk about conserving sexual energy in name of celibacy or Brahmacharya and preach it is  really necessary for spiritual upliftment.     It is true that it is the same cosmic energy that is present in living beings as the sex force. This energy is considered as sacred, something that is worthy of being worshipped, not frittered away. The normal logic is that any sense experience consumes prana. It is also considered logical that higher spiritual pursuits need lots of prana and hence any activity that depletes the pranic levels is not recommended. It is said that celibacy ensures the abundance of prana to the seeker.    But, many modern sexologist laugh at this traditional view of conserving sexual energy, saying that it is an affluent that will find its way out, any way.    For the modern man, it is better to trade the middle path. Indulge in it if you like, but without the guilt attached to it. Preserve it if it is possible for you. It is always better to control and discipline our senses gradually, only through understanding and not abruptly. In any case the truth is not in the extremes. It is always better to follow the middle path. It is true that all our Rishis were married and lived a balanced sex life, and still attained to greatest heights in spirituality.-|`|MzKTLRgpaa	"As simply put as possible, love is the force out of which being comes. Love seeks expression and creativity. Sexual expression is one way that love seeks creativity. It is hardly the only way, however. Love finds expression through the arts, religion, play, and helpful actions toward others. Period." ~Seth    So, to answer your question...  It's not so much that you "save" the energy, as much as it is the way you "use" the energy... whether it be used through sexual expression, the arts, etc etc etc, as long as one loves what they are doing then it will all-ways be a spiritual uplift! Period.|`|Run7dyraaa	I don't think sexual energy has anything to do with spiritual uplift. I believe they are two separate things. Sexual energy is sexual energy.|`|QCejFqXgaa	Blessings, Yes Sex energy is the strongest energy a man or woman can create within our bodies. Almost all of us use this sex energy to seek out physical fulfillment, however when this energy was harnessed into other activities, great achievements could be made where they once were not possible.The power of this process     or  energy       is incredible and not to be overlooked not take for granted.|`|KaQLLLXfaa	Yes. During Samadhi (true one) the semen gets burned and it helps in spiritual uplifting.|`|AA11894640	In other words,  you are asking if Asceticism helps in Spiritual Upliftment,  right?    Those practising celibacy by ably controlling their thoughts & actions,  would be better placed to answer this.    Gandhiji was one such practitioner in later life and even said to have tested himself in the company of young girls.  From what we all have heard,  he was able to channelise his energies towards spiritual path successfully...|`|eKDYbe9Laa	can be|`|0d85c75ad9af82d5d65e9443e37053f8aa	Sexual energy has nothing to do with Spiritual uplift. However its mantle satisfaction can help you for concentration on Spiritual Path.|`|ICGbWZ63aa	Neither having sex with my spouse nor refraining from sexual intercourse with my spouse will bring me closer to God.    For some people, sex is their god.  They worship their bodies and the creation rather than the Creator.  God alone deserves and demands our worship and adoration and honor.      If you had asked about FASTING, I would have agreed that it is possible to give more attention to God during a time of fasting; however, one's sexual life with his spouse does not affect his relationship with God.    If the person is not married, I believe the person can choose not to masturbate (a sinful action) and channel his energy in more productive and creative manners; however, this does not relate in any manner to a closer relationship to God.|`|4ad0fb30a1174358bcdd57576983960caa	Enjoy it initially, save it when one rise above it.

It is more of a personal choice to become angry. Of course, it is much easier to show God's love thorough happiness.|`|YVJQ7Y4jaa	I do not know the answer to your question. I suspect that being who we are as humans causes us to be like we are. We have the free will to follow Jesus or not. There are many things that affect our personality and feelings. Jealousy and pride. The hurt that comes from an unfaithful wife or husband causes anger. The death of a child causes hurt and anger.  War, politics, oppressive  governments, racism, social inequality also cause anger and at times depression.  I for one, honor and love my God, yet there are times I am angry for one reason or another. I am far from being the ideal Christian. It is very difficult to be humble. I love and honor my family, yet we, even as a family have our frustrations and moments of anger. We as a family, feed the poor, give them clothing, money for shelter. We cannot support everyone. When we are thanked, we tell the person to thank God not us. Yes! We love with a passion, yet we have our moments where anger creeps in. We are not Jesus, nor are we perfect. I am at peace with myself and with most people I come into contact with, but not everyone.|`|AFDgHtZCaa	My friend  that's a good question,BUT PERHAPS if Christians had a little more "righteous anger", like Christ had with the moneychangers, this world  might a little better place.    Instead we preach a "social gospel" of "peace & love" to atheist, agnostic's, deist & other unbelievers.    EDIT: My brother I would strongly suggest before you take on the task of "CHASTISING" other Christians you spend much time in prayer & Bible study so YOU will become "PERFECT"    After all Christ did say " he that is WITHOUT SIN cast the first stone".    Friends do you really "know" Christ as your Savior or do you just "know OF Him",    IF YOU DON'T KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR REPENT & BELIEVE IN HIM FOR SALVATION AS HE'S SOON COMING BACK!!!|`|kkSyz6aoaa	You can thank people like us.|`|AA11002471	You make a valid point.

One problem I can see right away is that if you were to be like the desciples and apostles then you whould be prepared to take the abuse they took.  Are you and i willing to go to jail for the gospels sake?  Are we able to pray and be healed if bitten by a serpent? Can we do as Jesus demonstrated from the cross and say "forgive them father because they know not what they do" referring to the Roman soldiers that hung him there after beating him and spitting in His face, etc. Could we ask God to forgive them?  it should just be part of our nature; but I am afraid there are very few in my knowledge who have the faith to do so.  Could you?  Could I?  We need to start with soul searching ourselves before we start with the others.  Coul I do it? should be the foremost question here...right?|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	One person's anger is another's righteous indignation.

QLDMmp6Taa	The spirit of the AntiChrist has been in the world.  There have been many AntiChrists, but from my research I've learned there is apparently going to be one main one. He has not come yet, but will come.  When he does the majority of the world will be led to believe in him (including many Christians, despite what they think now-- he might even be able to trick me).    I used to believe that the Anti Christ would come from the Church (the Catholic Church-- I am Catholic and yet I thought this too because it kind of made sense he might), but now realize this is more than likely not the case after studying more-- I won't bore you with details of how I came to that conclusion.  Since most people are looking for him to come from the church, that would mean he probably isn't because who the heck listens to the Pope anyway? lol...would be kind of stupid for Satan to get the Pope to do his bidding wouldn't it?  I mean, after all every single non-catholic (1 billion Islamic + 1 billion non-catholic Christians) wouldn't listen to him, and plus the majority of Catholics who know their faith would be like, 'yeah right!'...so there goes that theory out the window)    Obviously he will come from somewhere else, and he will lead the majority of people in the three major faiths (Islam, Christianity, and Judaism -- even nonbelievers) into believing he is either a Messiah, the Mahdi, Jesus, or a great prophet of some kind).  The only way I can see this happening is if he comes from the middle east.  When it does happen, many Christians will lose their faith.    I believe that he will try to destroy the Church.  He will point to the Church as the false religion, and the majority of the world will go along with him because of the signs and wonders he will be able to do.  Obviously this is already something being prepared for, as there are many in the world who already hate the Church and wouldn't care if it is destroyed-- some would celebrate today if the Church were gone.  Also I see many posts (like one on here) saying the AntiChrist will be the Pope, so when someone shows up doing all these things and says the Pope is the AntiChrist and he is the real deal and tells everyone to destroy the church, you think they will listen?  Of course they will.    EDIT: The poster who said that it "is modern dogma" is ignorant of Church history.  In early church writings they talk about the AntiChrist as a person who is coming.  Besides, the bible wouldn't have mentioned it at all if it wasn't something early Christians taught.|`|7ylYxklsaa	Please read your Bible. The word 'antichrist' only appears 5 times in the Bible and only in reference to all non-christians, never once to one single person.

If you want to know why the          suffer then read below.      In answering this question, the first thing to consider is whether such a thing as the          even exists. According to the Bible, the heart is wicked and deceitful above all things (Jeremiah 17:9), and all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). Therefore, no one is          in the sense of being sinless. Sin entered the world when Adam and Even rebelled against God in the Garden of Eden, and mankind has been in rebellion ever since. Sins effects permeate everything, and the suffering we see all around us is a direct result of that sin.    But God did not leave us here to suffer pointlessly. Our loving and merciful God has a perfect plan to use that suffering to accomplish His threefold purpose. First, He uses pain and suffering to draw us to Himself so that we will cling to Him. Jesus said, In the world you shall have tribulation (John 16:33). Trials and distress are not something unusual in life; they are part of what it means to be human in a fallen world. In Christ we have an anchor that holds fast in all the storms of life, but if we never sail into those storms, how would we know that? It is in times of despair and sorrow that we reach out to Him, and, if we are His children, we always find Him there waiting to comfort and uphold us through it all. In this way, He proves His faithfulness to us and ensures that we will stay close to Him. An added benefit is that as we experience Gods comfort through trials, we are then able to comfort others in the same way (2 Corinthians 1:4).    Second, He proves to us that our faith is real through the suffering and pain that are inevitable in this life. How we respond to suffering is determined by the genuineness of our faith. Those with faith truly from God, the author and finisher of our faith (Hebrews 12:2), will not be crushed by suffering, but will come through the trial with their faith intact, having been proven through fire so that it might be found to praise and honor and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ (1 Peter 1:7). Those are the ones who do not shake their fists at God or question His goodness, but instead count it all joy (James 1:2), knowing that trials prove that they are truly the children of God. Blessed is the man who endures temptation, because having been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him (James 1:12).    Finally, God uses suffering to take our eyes off this world and put them on the next. The Bible continually exhorts us to not get caught up in the things of this world, but to look forward to the world to come. This world and all that is in it will pass away, but the kingdom of God is eternal. Jesus said, My kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36), and those who would follow Him must not see the things of this life, both good and bad, as the end of the story. Even the sufferings we endure and which seem so terrible are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed in us (Romans 8:18).    Could God prevent all suffering? Of course. But He assures us that all things work together for good to those who love God and are called according to His purpose (Romans 8:28). So even suffering is part of the all things that God is using to accomplish His good purposes. His plan is perfect, His character is flawless, and those who trust Him will not be disappointed.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	Trent: spoken like a battered woman. "He only hurts me because he loves me." You guys have issues.|`|ScrzuZ2Vaa	Thats the same thing i wonder!!!!|`|8pQrIL90aa	God allows suffering because it is the fallen nature of man. We are not in the state that we were meant to be. We have a spirit called Satan that deceived Even then she deceived adam and they brought sin into the world. we have a world full of fallen angels that you cannot see, and they cause alot of the problems that we have today. We are a sinful people and we need our souls prepared for eternal life. Sin is part of this training process, in which we lay down our lives to the one true God, and stop being Gods over our own lives. Haven't you noticed? There are Gods everywhere, and they don't exist only in religion.    Suffering can stop but before it does it must make its point. We are too quick to look into the world for answers, when the world is a big lie, and it is not spiritual. When a baby dies people think that we have a cruel GOD, but if they knew and believed that the baby was going back to heaven, they would weep but they would strive to GO where the child is going to be.    Suffering is part of the fallen nature of man. Jesus came and suffered for the sake of wisdom, so that he could stand before GOD on the behalf of mankind. We suffer because we are sinners.    Seek GOD. Pray and stop looking at the world for answers. You will only find lies and deceit. Think spiritual and you will learn all that you need to know. We are a physical people under spiritual attack.     Through suffering we learn obedience because we know that the suffering is NOT of God but of the devil and GOD allows it. Why? because it is needed to teach mankind they need a GOD, a righteous GOD, and they cannot govern themselves without one.    that is why the bible calls us "little children" Some of us are obedient and some are disobedient. Some of us are hellbound, and I wish that this were not true.|`|WGzb3Fhaaa	this is one question I am searching the answer for!|`|CjRfJbncaa	It actually has to do with God setting a Universal Legal Precedent.  This is thoroughly explained in the articles:    Why Does God Permit Suffering?  http://watchtower.org/e/20010515/article...    Why God Has Permitted Suffering    http://watchtower.org/e/dg/article_06.ht...    Once that has been done, all causes of pain, suffering, & death will be eternally done away with:    "For Jehovah is a lover of justice, And he will not leave his loyal ones. To time indefinite they will certainly be guarded; But as for the offspring of the wicked ones, they will indeed be cut off.  The righteous themselves will possess the earth, And they will reside forever upon it." --Psalm 37:28-29    "They will certainly build houses and have occupancy.   They will certainly plant vineyards and eat [their] fruitage.   They will not build and someone else have occupancy;   they will not plant and someone else do the eating.   For like the days of a tree will the days of my people be;   and the work of their own hands my chosen ones will use to the full. 23   They will not toil for nothing, nor will they bring to birth for disturbance; because they are the offspring made up of the blessed ones of Jehovah, and their descendants with them." --Isaiah 65:21-23    "So my word that goes forth from my mouth will prove to be. It will not return to me without results, but it will certainly do that in which I have delighted, and it will have certain success in that for which I have sent it." --Isaiah 55:11|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	That is the greatest mystery|`|NqAzcrtsaa	because humans are jerks.|`|mNyhRGowaa	How can you ask that question if he doesn't exist in your mind?|`|XN0cYCATaa	The curious as well as the critics of Christianity ask this question. If God is all-powerful and all loving, then why does He permit evil and suffering in the world? Various answers have been given but permanently settling the issue is impossible because so many of our answers raise further questions. Nevertheless, our lack of ability to answer the question perfectly does not mean that we cannot offer solutions. Of course, I do not assume to be able to answer these questions definitively, but I can offer some solutions.       First of all, it is possible that God has reasons for allowing evil to exist that we simply cannot understand. In this the Christian can have confidence in God knowing that His ways are above our ways (Isaiah 55:8-9). As the Bible says, the just shall live by faith (Hab. 2:4).       Second, God may be letting evil run its course in order to prove that evil is evil and that suffering, which is the unfortunate product of evil, is further proof that anything contrary to Gods will is bad, harmful, painful, and leads to death.        God gave Adam dominion over the world (Gen. 1:28). When he rebelled against God, he set in motion an entire series of events and changed the very nature of man and creation. Both were affected by sin. Creation was no longer a paradise, but bore thorns and thistles (Gen. 3:17-18; Rom. 8:22). People became sinful (Rom. 5:12; Eph. 2:3), who were haters of God (Rom. 3:19-12), etc. The only conclusion to such a situation is death. Jesus said, "And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened" (Matt. 24:22).        Sin is rebellion against God and His created order. But God has not left us alone in this fallen world. He continued to enter this world, pointing us to Himself, to truth, to morality, purity, and love. He used the evil of the world (liars, perjurers, the envious, etc), to bring His Son to the cross so that we might have the opportunity of eternal life. In this, God has not stepped away from fallen creation, but has stepped into it by becoming Jesus. God works within the fallen world to affect change and He uses fallen people to accomplish His will. In this, He is proving His sovereignty over evil, suffering, and rebellious people, proving that sin and evil are utterly futile, and that He is worthy of honor and glory.       A third possible reason that God is letting evil occur is so that on the day of judgment, the condemned will have no right to say that their sentence is unjust. God is not stopping people from exercising their free will. Think about this: If someone said that God should stop evil and suffering, then should God then stop all evil and suffering? If God only stopped some of it, then we would still be asking the same question of why it exists. So, if we want God to stop evil and suffering, then He must stop all of it. We have no problem with this when it means stopping a catastrophe, or a murder, or a rape. But what about when someone thinks of something evil? Evil is evil whether it is acted out or not. Hatred and bigotry in someones heart is wrong. If it is wrong, and if God is to stop all evil, then He must stop that person from thinking his own thoughts. To do that, God must remove his freedom of thought. Furthermore, which person on the earth has not thought something evil? God would be required, then, to stop all people from exercising their free will. This is something God has chosen not to do. Therefore, we could say that one of the reasons that God permits evil and suffering is because of mans free will.       Fourth, it is quite possible that God uses the suffering to do good. In other words, He produces patience through tribulation (Rom. 5:3). Or He may desire to save someone through it. Take for example, the account of Joseph who was sold into slavery by His brothers. What they did was wrong and Joseph suffered greatly for it. But, later, God raised up Joseph in Egypt to make provisions for the people of that land during the coming drought of seven years. But not only was Egypt saved, but also so was his family and brothers who originally sold him into slavery. Joseph finally says to them, "You meant it for evil, but God meant it for good" (Gen. 50:15-21). Of course, the greatest example of God using evil for good is the death of Christ. Evil people brought him to the cross, but God used that cross as the means to save the world.       But then we must ask, if this is true, are we working against God by working against evil and suffering? No, we are not. God says he does not want us to sin and suffer. But it is simply true that God can use evil despite of its apparent despicable nature.        God is in the world using the world and its failures for His glory and the benefit of those who listen to Him.      But then, what about those who seem to innocently suffer with no benefit resulting? What about the woman who is raped, or the innocent by stander who is killed by a stray bullet. In both cases, the victims and families suffer nothing but pain and loss. What good can this possibly be?       I think that the answer is two-fold. One, ultimately, no one is innocent. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23) and are by nature children of wrath (Eph. 2:3). There is none innocent. Though this is biblically accurate, it does not satisfy the question emotionally. Why do little babies suffer for things they have not done? I must acknowledge that I do not know. Ultimately, we must trust God who knows the beginning from the end and sees the grand picture. He will have the final word and He will be vindicated.          Conclusion         Suffering is the result of human sin. The world is not the way that God created it and because of that, all are vulnerable to the affects of sin in the world. Why does one person suffer and another does not? Why do catast|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	God allows us to choose good or evil, and when we choose, we are the ones with our dumb choices who cause our own suffering , not God...  God does not force anyone into submission, that is the kind of loving God He is, and He also wants us to love Him back, but not by force, but because of Who He is...|`|c85faeebb94f70edb6993c9354121ea7aa	It is the result of our fallen state.  Personally I believe that pain is inevitable but misery is optional.  There are many different ways of seeing things.  Choose the positive.      According to scripture, if I interpret it correctly, we "reap what we sow".  Simply stated...if we hurt others, we ourselves will be hurt in the future.  If you plant tomatoes it does not come up cucumbers.  It is the same with our actions.  We reap what we sow.      I also believe that God allows some suffering for us to realize who He is and why we need Him.  Some say that experience is the best teacher.  It is a learning tool.      Of course, I could be completly deluded.  Who can say?|`|UeMz0uEBaa	Thats a question i always ask myself when i look at the news and see so much people suffering; the people and children in the gaza, caylee anthony, jobenet ramsey and many others.

He set 1 rule and only 1 rule for His first children and they chose to disobey that rule. They were told their punishment if they disobeyed. They knew the risk. They disobeyed anyway.    Are you a parent? I am. I have to make rules for my children like bedtimes, food, and chores to keep them mentally and physically healthy. They know what their punishment will be if they disobey and the know what the reward is if they obey.    Fairness is the fact that as a parent the rules are made up front, the punishment and rewards are told up front. That's being a fair and honest parent who teaches and trains their child with love.    God gives us the rules. He had them written down in English for us. He gave us the punishment for disobedience and He lists the rewards for obedience. He is a fair and honest parent who wishes for us to choose to obey.    God allows us to choose. Us. Not just me but not the others on the planet. I was raped so I know fully the extent of this question. Why did God allow this to happen to me?    He gave me freedom of choice. He gives that man freedom of choice. It is not His will for that man to do that or for us to sin, He made us without sin and we chose to disobey Him and allow sin to become part of our DNA. We are all now born with the ability to sin. He gives each of us the choice to do what's right and receive the benefit or do what's wrong and receive the punishment. He did not force His will on that man like that man forced his will on me. God allows us all to choose.    I had to understand that my comfort was not in the fact that God will control that man's will and make him not want to hurt me, but in the fact that He was there with me. He says He will never leave me nor forsake me. He says He will give me peace.    He was there. He was there at the birth of my now 3-year-old beautiful baby girl whom I love dearly. He is here with me now.    I could not answer your question if I had not been there, done that, even to some small extent. 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 is one of my favorite answers to this question.    3 Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God. 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. 6 And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.    7 And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.    It says the word comfort or consolation 9 times! It says we suffer so that we can comfort others with the same hope and comfort He gives to us.

Suffering may be a result of our own actions(karma) - wrong actions, wrong decisions, wrong approaches. It is our responsibility(effort) to evolve beyond these associations and free ourselves from suffering. We are created with all resources(material) for sufficiency and happiness, it is our qualities (of mind/senses) that make us unsatisfied and suffer in short of real happiness.     God has only manifested(created) Sentient Beings and Matter acc. to their own properties/consciousness, but God does not take part in their evolution(karmA). Thus GOD does not do miracles, He may rarely intervene/help the noble souls , only in the path of realization, not in ordinary material possessions. All others are there to learn through struggles, strife then strive/evolve. There are instances that seem to help everyone ,[E.g  that of food drives, peace/freedom movement] that may seem to be God's help but baed on one's own good karmA, there are instances that make people suffer [E.g: epidemic, wars, natural calamities, famine] but purely based on one's own bad actions(KarmA) .    So, all life's dramA is to ultimately make us realize all the material existence is short lived and a struggle for temporary bliss.

wwdllMzYaa	heres my cut and paste answer for this q, as i think it explains it best  ;-)    I dont believe in a religious expectation of a god because;    *There is no tangible evidence, the words and books of man are not evidence of anything other than man can speak and write down their words    *There are no measurable effects, and if there was a being the magnitude of a god, there would definitely be effects on our universe, on our world,   And if there was a being such as a god, the effects would be emmence,     *There are no supporting theorys or evidence mathematical or scientific, from any leading scientists, or philosophers or even religious scientists, even einsten could NOT prove the existence of any god/creator (he did not believe in the religious personal god either ) and he tried to do this his whole life, he died having failed to  If there was any real way to prove a god/creators existence, I feel pretty confident in thinking einsten would have been one of those who COULD support it, even in a small way    *The religious description of a god/creator is a sociological description, created by society and is based purely on psychology and has no basis in reality or probability    Ie, he is all powerful, all forgiving, all caring, is there for you your whole life,if you just ask, loves you when you feel unloved, helps you when you feel helpless, is there for you when you are alone, so you are never alone, and he even takes care of you in your afterlife in a heaven, where you are rewarded for all your good in this life, and those who dont believe or who were bad are punished, so making believers feel secure, safe, loved, and having no fear of life nor death    *If there was a god/creator, it can not be the christian or religious expectation of a god  because it would also be affected by the universal laws , same as all life and energy in the universe , gravity, time, age, and even death would all affect this god IF it was involoved in affecting our lives, ie causing miracles, answering prayers, making things happen, it would HAVE to come into our universal bubble and ergo be affected by these laws    for this god to be unaffected by these universal laws, would mean it can not and does not enter or affect our universe, in any way, it just sits watching, outside of our universal bubble which it CANT enter, ever, so it can NOT make miracles happen, it can NOT answer prayers, it  can NOT ever affect your life un any way, it just watches maybe even hears, but can not affect  effectively, it created us, but does not affect our existence in any way    That is the realistic logical, scientific being that we would call a god or a creator  The man made version, is implausible and impossible      your welcome ;-)    if you have any qs, just ask, as i said, its my cut and paste, so if you wanna know anything specific, say  ;-)      and thank you for being respectful and polite, its a rarity on here ;-(  but, its appreciated a lot when soemone is nice ;-)|`|47sALOGfaa	I was never indoctrinated into a mind control cult.    These mind control cults are just like the cigarette companies. They know that if they can get you when you are young (vulnerable and impressionable) they will most likely have you for the rest of your life. On the other hand, if you can make it to adulthood without falling into one of their traps then you most likely never will.

The bible for me is one whole mess of allegory and mythos. We know that alot of the Hebrew bible is taken from the Egyptian Book of the Dead, that the NT was not written by first hand witnesses but 2nd, 3rd and so on. The other problem is the NT is filled with Egyptian Mythos, built around Isis, Osiris and Horus, that these ancient religions have been taken as literal by the early Christians and then corrupted by the later Catholic church. The reformation highlighted the narcissism and corruption of the Catholic church, we were able then to question the 'facts' that the church had taught to us from the beginning, we found that a lot of their beliefs were the beliefs of men not Jesus....to keep it short, the Catholic church is the foundation of christianity as we know it, all 3000 different christian religions are bound to its foundations, but the foundations are on shaky ground and it is only a matter of time before the whole inner sanctum comes crumbling down. The Church has survived so long due to its capacity to adapt itself to modern philosophy, but how much longer can it adapt until the foundations of the dogma are called into question? how much more can it change its mind? how many doctrines can be overturned before people of the congregation ask why? The new pope has changed much, but will it be enough to outlast the 21st century, before the whole things comes crashing down.    As for JW'S, well they have made far too many predictions for the end of the world to be taken seriously. If you are to be part of a religon that predicts the end of the world they should at least get it right, otherwise where does their credibility come from?|`|sKXzYvaRaa	There is no evidence any god or goddesses exist.|`|FbOkPyEpaa	There's no proof that god exists.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	1.)

Every theist claims to know God, often intimately, so why is it hard, if not impossible for even members of the same church, to define God and his dynamics?    No one has every seen a God, heard a God speak, even measured his/her presence, but millions believe in his/her existence, as if they were talking about the family dog.    Theists often make definitive, often convoluted, statements on the workings of God, as if they were truisms.    Yet, these truisms differ from individual believer, to individual believer?    The reason for this inconsistency is simple.    God only exists in peoples minds.

This then begs the questions: Where does the soul reside (physiologically speaking), when did it arise in animals, was it specifically within the Homo genus, do other animals have souls, and most importantly, how many times has this 'soul' come about through evolution (i.e. convergent evolution)?    Note that it will be mighty difficult for you to answer any (let alone all) of these questions since you're going off the *assumption* that such a soul exists.    I believe in the immaterial soul. This is a soul that exists due to the collective interraction between different parts of the central nervous system. Such a soul has no single locus in a human body, and roughly corresponds to mere consciousness.    I'm religious, believe in God, believe in the soul, accept Darwinian evolution, and do not believe in any Adam & Eve.|`|Tk4cr3UVaa	yes obviously as intelligence is a product of our evolution it follows that a soul would to.  Though what advantage that gives us to discovered.|`|5tMCDu8gaa	The "soul" is included in evolution. Lots of other highly developed mammals do show emotional and perceptual awareness. Anyone who has ever owned a pet can tell you that they do have their own individual personalities.    A handful of animals can recognize themselves in the mirror, which shows the very beginnings of metacognition - knowing that they exist, and are a single entity, apart from others.    Elephants morn their dead, and have burial rituals. They show empathy and compassion towards other species, including humans.    Even house cats can experience depressive symptoms when they are lonely, or sick.    Human beings can even recognize the facial expressions of chimpanzees with 80% accuracy, because our displays of emotion are so similar.    Just as humans have evolved a higher intellect, we have evolved more complex emotional workings, but that doesn't mean we are the only creatures with souls.    EDIT: To those saying we don't have souls, I think you are thinking of souls as a different entity from sentience, or awareness. It isn't really. "Soul" is the layman's term for sentience and awareness. A soul doesn't HAVE to be a supernatural occurrence.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	That would depends entirely on what you are considering a soul. Much of our intelligence is due to evolution, so what some people consider the soul may just be a result of our bigger brain.    I think it is still possible that there is an undefined/ undefinable human quality that isn't just part of our anatomy. No evidence of that at the moment though, so it would be silly to attempt to attribute something we don't even understand to evolution.    Adam and Eve could have been the first people to have that consciousness, or the story could be a representation of what happened over many generations.    I don't really know what you are trying to get at here. The concept of the soul isn't scientific so trying to work it into a scientific theory is not going to go anywhere.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	I would say the FIRST to be given a soul. -- If that's the choice.     However,  I think Adam and Eve might have been either purely allegorical to explain the central concepts and events to people OR if they did actually exist.. they might have been 2 of a group of humans and/or been the 2 which played a central role.     But the soul is something that God creates and controls.  Therefore he could have easily allowed life to evolve and THEN placed a soul in it.   Nothing is preventing him from doing that.     Therefore,  The bible starts with mankind coming from Adam and Eve ( not Adam and Steve...of wait..that's another question all together) possibly because they were the FIRST humans to have souls. Who knows?    In reality it changes very little. All the precepts of both the Jewish and Christian faiths still hold true, regardless of which "beginning" events took place.|`|AA12213253	7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. Genesis 2:7|`|AA11682977	~~my answer to you is.... God is the creator of ALL ! if the earth is millions of years old and God just took His time and laid out the format for us to be born when the time was right.  for a day to us is a thousand years to God ( K.J.V.) He took 7,000 years to just re establish the earth after it became void and without form.might be an ice age!  He would not have told the first creation to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth if there had not been living creations here before. there were  oriental, black & indian and the mix of them. if only people would read God's word with understanding,  we would not be so confused about His letter to us! if you check when God formed Ah-Adam and put him in a garden there was 'no man to till the soil'. now we all know there were hunters and gathers in the land. no one had much of as permanent place to call home.  we can further this line of thinking when we see how after cain killed able he went north into the land of nod and took a wife. so there must have been people living there back then. why can we not grasp the fact the God could have created a look-a-like man that had no soul but when He decided to create man in His own image the soul came in the picture. for a monkey like creation would not be in His image. ~~|`|l9uGrfSYaa	I have to admit I'm sitting on the fence post in this subject. I do believe that humans developed differently to survive in different enviornments. Saying that is sort of a downplay on evolution, but it's still a fact. I mean, humans are not the only animals that could have just stayed the same. Babies are starting to be born with out apendixes for humans do not eat raw meat as they suposedly did in prehistoric ages. That's a hint of a clue right there.     I'm not too big on religion, I just feel that there's a higher power. However the way that all animals have an ability to morals, it's hard to think that souls don't exist (I believe all animals, not just humans have souls).     sorry, if I didn't really have an exact answer.

That is the basis of all FAITH - is it not?  BUT, that being said - the gentlemen you heard speaking in Testimony Meeting was not speaking as an authority - he was just speaking and expressing his personal feelings.    However, over the years more archeological research and evidence has been sought by many within and without the church in Central American - regarding the book of mormon and the ancient peoples it bears witness of.  If you go to gospellink.com and search by "archeological evidence of book of mormon" you will find over 100 books that come up for your interest that address this specific topic.  Many are written by authors who are NOT LDS too.      Those who have visited ancient aztec and mayan ruins and surrounding areas - tell of many sites and many geographic anomolies that give a believing heart tremendous assurance that the book of mormon people did indeed live in these parts of the world.  Their culture also maintains historic writings, cave carvings, legends of people long past that seem to follow those things believed to be the ancient nephites and lamanites from the book of mormon itself.  I believe it is in Brazil that there is a great CARVED ROCK of rather large proportion that even the people of the area can not explain and it details EXACTLY the story told in the Book of Mormon of Lehi's vision of the Tree of Life - which is a very well known part of the book of mormon and even our theology & doctrine in many ways.    I can't say I know of MOUNTAINS of evidence - few could claim that.  Even believers of Christ and the Bible itself rarely have any physical or tangible proof or evidence of HIM and HIS existence in ancient israel and YET they all believe and seek no further proof than what their personal FAITH offers them.  Such is the case with Mormon people and our belief and love of the Book of Mormon and our testimony of its  truthfulness and of the Prophet Joseph Smith and his vision and the restoration of Christ's church to the earth.  PUT together those 3 things give LDS people GREAT FAITH and spiritual foundation for what we believe & know to be true.    Honestly physical EVIDENCE would not increase my testimony, nor would it for most LDS people you will meet.  It is of great interest and exciting to hear about - but what we KNOW, love and believe is based on our love of the gospel of Jesus Christ and our personal witness of the truthfulness of this church.|`|eomrfXrzaa	There isn't any.

And the leaders have asked us not to tell stories but give our "testimony".    There is as much or more evidence that Jesus visited the Americas as that he existed at all.  I have like 8 books on "evidences" and stories.  There is certainly stories the of the flood such as the picture book called Es-cheel-o-cheel, I will ot spell it out for you.    The Book of Mormon talks of lite and dark people, this is 1830, no one knew then  it talks of two distinct cultures, (Omecs and Mayan)  It gives evidence why the Mayans disappeared  It discusses that thy had wars, this has been verified  Temples, well you know that  Astronomy, if you studied the sites you would see it    There is a book that gives all this.

Physical evidence means nothing.|`|l2QUgSwzaa	noep there is non|`|G02cCLXJaa	The Book of Mormon is based on the teachings of Joseph Smith. He is supposed to have special revelation from God that revealed sacred teachings about a lost tribe of Israel that came to America and became our native Americans.    There is evidence that Jesus of Nazareth existed. First, it is unlikely that men would die to follow a non-entity. You may argue whether he was right. However, I know of no historical writing were someone made up a story of a non existent man and then was willing to die for him.    More importantly, a reputable Roman historian makes reference to Jesus. Again, that the man lived is as verifiable as any historical figure. Who he was and claimed to be may be argued but not that he lived.    Having said that, I am not aware of any evidence that Jesus was in the America's. It obviously doesn't matter that they weren't discovered back then. They were real and people lived there.    I would question that Jesus ever was there in his physical presence. The Bible claims that he considered Israel to be his only earthly focus. He even rejected ministry to the Gentiles. He commissioned that work to his followers.    I have not heard of any historical or archeological evidence that he was. I'm certain if there were, it would have been clearly identified by the Mormons as it would give great support to the book of Mormon.    Pastor John|`|n9PUzlhzaa	Jesus never visited America, He lived in Middle East.|`|iJgwxncgaa	Such closed minds it does me pride to see them in action. well i think he was referring to the book of mormon. before condemning it try reading it.(sorry not the poster my apologise there)  Then if you want to continue on the same theme try looking at the hymn Jerusalem      quote  " And did those feet in ancient time,      Walk upon Englands mountains green:      And was the holy Lamb of God,      On Englands pleasant pastures seen !        And did the Countenance Divine,      Shine forth upon our clouded hills ?      And was Jerusalem builded here,      Among these dark Satanic Mills ?"|`|621a4d17d13b63e02ffc57e463e95ed2aa	Well, according to the Mormoms, he did, after his resurrection, I believe, it is in Mormon scripture that he appeared to the inhabitants of the continent of North America.     It could also be said that He, Jesus, has visited America, because, where his faithful are, so is He - they are in Him and He in them.  That's a lot of evidence right there.  If you're a Christian, you shouldn't find it too far fetched to believe he has walked among us throughout the ages...|`|CTxGUFZOaa	8 And it came to pass, as they   understood they cast their eyes up        again towards heaven; and behold,  they saw a Man descending out of   heaven; and he was clothed in a  white robe; and he came down and  stood in the midst of them....   9 And it came to pass that he  stretched forth his hand and spake  unto the people, saying:   10 Behold, I am Jesus Christ,  whom the prophets testified shall  come into the world.   11 And behold, I am the light and  the life of the world; and I have   drunk out of that bitter cup which  the Father hath given me, and have  glorified the Father in taking upon  me the sins of the world, in the  which I have suffered the will of the   Father in all things from the  beginning.      14 Arise and come forth unto  me, that ye may thrust your hands  into my side, and also that ye may  feel the prints of the nails in my   hands and in my feet, that ye may  know that I am the God of Israel,   and the God of the whole earth, and  have been slain for the sins of the  world.    (Book of Mormon; 3 Nephi 11:8-11, 14)    Legends of the Great White God (described as bearded) who visited the ancestors of the Indians of the Americas were found in abundance when the Spanish explorers encountered these people; some here have noted beliefs regarding this.  This God promised to return to these people, which is the reason the Indians were at first thrilled to meet the white and bearded Spaniards.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	In  "Saga America" Barry Fell (not LDS) states:      "The sum total of evidence from burial sites, from the chance discovery of burial marker stones and boundary stones, from other sources, all adds up to a consistent and simple explanation of all the baffling facts; it is simply thisEuropean colonists and traders have been visiting or settling in the Americas for thousands of years, have introduced their scripts and artifacts and skills, and have exported abroad American products such as copper." -      I suspect the man you listened to was referring to the Book of Mormon at large.  I like to use the term "supporting evidence".  There's no indisputable proof, and there probably never will be.  Here are a few things for you to chew on, however:    Throughout the Americas and Polynesia, there's a permeating myth about a "fair skinned, bearded god" that descended from heaven, taught the people, healed the sick, and instructed them to write it down".  He is often depicted with holes in his hands and in his feet.  There have been drawings found of a man suspended on a cross.      They Maya called him Kulkulcan.  The Aztec called him Quetzalcoatl.  I believe the Inca called him Apocatequil.      In many of the ledgends he is the "son of the high God".  There are ruins in Mexico where there are 3 temples, one to the "high God" one to the "descending God" and a third to the "invisible God".  (Father, Son, Holy Ghost).    It's not hard for the LDS people to see the origin of these legends.       There have been inscriptions found in the Americas in Hebrew.  Las Lunas stones in New Mexico were one such example.  It is the 10 commandments written in Hebrew and dated to pre-colombus times.    In the ancient manuscript "The title of the Lords of Totonicapan", according to their oral tradition, their ancestors were "fair skinned" individuals who traveled across the ocean, and were son's of Abraham".      The Chanes have a ledgend that is very similar and a story of 2 brothers, their forfathers, that sounds like Nephi and Laban.    Wordprint analysis of the Book of Mormon demonstrate that it had many authors, and that none of them were Joseph Smith or Sydney Rigdon.    DNA anaylis shows that about 3% of all native Americans carry a Semitic marker known as haplogroup X.    The Book of Mormon describes the people around 400AD to be bloodthirsty, warlike, and to practice canibalism and human sacrifice.  It was only 30 years ago that scholars changed their stance and now believe they were as the Book of Mormon states.  Before that they believed that they were peaceful and neighborly.    There are phrases that are used in the Book of Mormon that are a little bit strange.  However, when translated directly into some Indian languages of Guatemala, they are word-for-word expressions that are still used today.     Joseph Smith was ridiculed for "writing" about a people that understood astronomy, used cement, had interconnecting highways, had large cities, some of which were buried in the ocean, and used cement.  All of these things have since been found in the Americas.      There are many detailed and perfect examples of chiasmuses.  A chiasmus is a form of contextual poetry and a very unique writing style that is found in middle eastern writings.  Joseph Smith never mentioned them.  They were not even discovered until well after the Book of Mormon was published, and it was many years later that they were recognized in the Book of Mormon.     There is a mayan glyph that is used frequently at the beginning of a new sentence.  It can be translated to "and it came to pass", a phrase used many, many times in the Book of Mormon.    When the Book of Mormon was initially translated, it had no punctuation.  Mayan writings similarly been found to contain no punctuation.      Stone boxes have been found in the Americas, like the one that Joseph Smith described.  There have been isolated tribes of Caucasian Indians found in Panama and other places.      The interesting thing about the Book of Mormon is that when compared with what was "known" to be true by scholars, it is much more true and accurate today than it was when it was published about 180 years ago.  That's a tough feat to pull off.    There are many things that we have yet to learn about the history of the Americas.  The largest city that we know of, El Mirador, has yet to be excavated.  We still can't understand Olmec writings.  We have no idea how to pronounce verbally Mayan writings.  The Libraries of the Aztec, Maya, and Inca were burned by the conquistadors.  Metals were smelted down into bars.  What the Spanish didn't destroy, the environment did.  Stone and pottery are about the only things that survive in that environment.      While none of these things are irrefutable proof, to one that is sincere, they've very difficult to ignore or simply explain away.    We generally don't dwell on these things.  Archeological proof is not what changes hearts, minds, and lives.  We encourage everyone to hear our message, read all or part of the Book of Mormon, and then humbly and sincerely find out from God, via prayer, if Joseph Smith was a prophet  or not and if the Book of Mormon is true or not.      Hope that helps.  God bless.|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	Aur contraire, Angel of Caffeine. There is evidence of the Lord visiting the Americas. If you have studied the lore, myths, and legends of our American Indian you would know that virtually every tribe, or Nation, has a legend of a white God visiting their ancestors.    The reason why Hernando Cortez was able to vanquish the Aztecs so easily was because the natives, in their legends, heard of ancient prophesies of a white God that would return to them and teach more. His name was Questzalcoatl, verified in the stories handed down through the ages and with pictographs discovered in the ancient's temples.    This is just one side of the mountain of evidence. The Lord, in modern times, visited the early prophets of the Church--namely, Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery--and gave revelations and visions to many in the congregation. But then that would require one to read the Doctrine and Covenants, an additional holy scripture of the LDS Church.    Added note: Many responders have a difficult time believing that the Christ could visit the Americas clear across the oceanic expanse. The God of this earth, its creator, could easily be anywhere He so chooses by thinking about it. Conveyances as we know mean nothing to a resurrected holy Being with all the attributes of His Holy Father.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	Potential evidence needs to be accepted as evidence to have weight.    There are many murals, temples, legends, and carvings depicting a bearded God descending down.  Every school child knows the story of the acceptance of the spaniards because they were supposed to be gods; supposed to be gods because they were fair skinned and bearded.    I would call all the evidences a mountain of evidences; some believe and some don't - than again in the middle east many claim that there are no evidences of Jesus living either.    What's ironic are all of the Christians saying that there is no evidence of Christ in the americas while accepting all evidence of Him in the middle east.    It all depends on what you choose to believe.  Convincing evidence is what was in that man's heart, not the archeology.

I suppose I could be wrong but ...    A true 'god' worth bowing to would NOT require it.    If you were able to manufacture some sort of living being, would you require it to worship you, glorify you, incessantly utter your name, build buildings dedicated to you, ask you for all sortsa STUFF or give thanks to you ... day in, day out, ad nauseam, endlessly?

That said, I'll accept what wikipedia says: "The term "religion" refers to both the personal practices related to communal faith and to group rituals and communication stemming from shared conviction. "Religion" is sometimes used interchangeably with "faith" or "belief system," but it is more socially defined than personal convictions, and it entails specific behaviors, respectively."    This same article has several points that suggest that person conviction, that is, "reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things" is also religion.    To me, the path one follows is their religion, whether it involves any organization, church, or other material article (including the Bible).|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	If you can't then you have to seriously question whether you are worshipping 'God' or the religion itself.|`|vQ75GgNnaa	Religion is when e few people share the same belief therefore if there was no religion someone would naturally start seeking God and by sharing his revelations to others someone else would necessarily believe it and so a religion would be born.

The laws got more and more numerous and complex, and nobody could remember all of them, much less keep them all.    Then Jesus came and said not to worry about that because He was giving us one preeminent commandment that encompassed and complemented all the others:  love one another the way He loved us.    So that's the core message of the Bible:  love others.|`|03c287c9e9e2feef723946b70ad122f4aa	Oui|`|YupMCYHlaa	I love the Bible, but just on the level of ancient literature.  It was written over literally thousands of years, by hundreds of people.  Some of it is meant to be read as allegory, some as legend, some as an attempt at history.  People wrote to the best of their knowledge, which was imperfect, just as ours is.    I think the Bible is very valuable if only to show how people felt about things in those long-ago days, and to show how little human nature has changed in all these years.  But I don't think it is God's word, inspired by God, written by God, I think it's just people writing about their beliefs at the time.    Over the years the Bible hasn't changed, but the way people read it has changed, the way people interpret it, what they find in it.  Some people feel absolutely sure they know exactly what every passage in the Bible means, but if they read Bible explanations and exegesis over the years they might not be so sure.  The Bible is full of inconsistencies and downright contradictions so it's impossible to be sure just exactly what it says.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Do as we say.    Literally.    That is the bible.

We also believe that the bishops of the Catholic Church were guided by the Holy Spirit when they gathered in council at the end of the 4th Century to finalize just which texts should be included in the book they were compiling.  Therefore the 73 texts they discerned as divinely inspired, nothing more and nothing less, comprise the Christian Scriptures.

There is reason to believe that these stories changed with each telling and eventually ended up as caricatures of the originals.  The Gospels of the New Testament, for example, not to mention the Gospels that were excluded from the New Testament, don't always agree.      People, usually because of political motives, required that other people accept these written stories as the indisputable word of God. Some even require that people believe that these stories were written by the hand of God. Whatever you believe, these stories have been passed along for thousands of years and are used, almost world wide, as the basis for a way of living in groups and getting along with others.    Whether you believe any of this stuff or not, the bible is a great read. Sex, crime, violence, mysteries, love affairs, murder, etc., there is something for everyone.

kZeu2Dyzaa	A person who claims to be an atheist yet constantly discusses divinity in a negative light (either in person or via a forum such as Y!A) falls into one of two categories:    1. They do not really believe that there is no God even though they want to. Their doubt of the validity of atheism leads them to attempt to validate their belief in it through the persecution of people who do not believe in it.    2. They were mistreated, abused, neglected, or otherwise harmed during their formative years by an outspoken proponent of some brand of divinity and their adamant belief in atheism coupled with their preoccupation for harassing non-atheists is their misguided attempt to "get even" with the person who wronged them.|`|urIm4YaBaa	Truth be told, I have a lot more bones to pick with my "fellow" nonbelievers.    The only reason I spend any time is because: (1) large segments of the population try to push their beliefs onto us, and I don't appreciate the uninvited attempts to "save" my soul; and (2) large segments of the population use their beliefs to justify or advocate certain public policies in the secular nation that I was born in, have lived in, and intend to live in during my entire life.    Most of my time that's devoted to working on philosophy isn't spent on areas that I've explored thoroughly (such as whether or not supernatural beings exist) because new evidence is not coming forward for examination. Instead, I continue working on the details of the principles by which I live my life.    I understand that some Atheists see religion as a dangerous force causing all sorts of problems in the world throughout history, and that they therefore wish to eradicate it. I understand the argument they make, but I think that the way they look at current affairs and history is overly simplistic and the details that they tend to gloss over doesn't support their conclusion. Nevertheless, it would explain why some Atheists spend huge amounts of energy on the "deconversion effort."|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	listen to these answers force religion in schools (where do you live where they force anything in school)    bomb abortion clinics... those are not christians those are prolife nut jobs you do not have to be religious to have a few of those around.

We talk about the oppression that takes place when one group tries to force its version of "morality" on everyone else, claiming that they have some divine right to do so.|`|niDOzrJraa	I dont promote atheism...I just simply like to debate.

zpXTgUpiaa	Because ever since the start of time good people have been going to heaven. So at first, there were probably billions of chairs. However, since the population of earth increases exponentially, so does the death rate. So in order for their to be enough chairs in heaven, the production of chairs has to increase exponentially, which also means that the amount of workers making chairs has to increase exponentially, and how many people do you know who want to spend all of time making chairs?|`|EAuMJrs4aa	sadam keeps hiding them to annoy the mormons, join the rest of us in hell only two nights a week are standing room only      icanflyi... actualy its not a production issue thats the main thing me and the rest of the people in hell will be doing making chairs for heaven and licence plate for the angels feraris. its that damn sadam see.|`|vjAGUCSlaa	Very good question... wasn't Jesus' old man a carpenter or something?

A society that hypocritical allows for divorce but bans gay marriage in what is supposed to be a society that has freedom of religion cannot last with changing eventually.

Until divorce is banned the fundamentalist crowd is nothing but a bunch of hateful self-serving hypocrites on the wrong side of history.

So it depends largely on your definition of   (a) "10 Commandments" and   (b) "relationships".    By the way, the numbering varies amongst the versions, so even which one is  4 could be in doubt.  They are not numbered at all in the Judeo-Christian bible.|`|YH6Ja07eaa	If applied with an open minded attitude, I think it would have helped my last marriage.|`|AA10471892	To answer your question, no.  Love is the guideline to all relationships.    The law is for the ungodly and sinners, etc.    1 Timothy 1:9 ?Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,  10 ?For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;    Christians are referred to in Scripture as the righteous.  Seeing as that law is not for the righteous, it must be for those who are not righteous; those who have embraced the law, thereby rejecting the gospel and salvation through faith.|`|aW7hFbuaaa	1 John 3:23 (King James Version)     23And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.

Many times over  Atheist, Gnostic, Agnostic, Taoism, Wicca, Satanism, Bahi, Buddhists, Christian, Messianic Jew those are the only ones I ever practiced in full but I did study an array of others both main stream and obscure     The why is way too long  so I will just say cause I was just searching for truth  and God said if you search with all your heart you will find it so, putting all denial, malice, guile and precepts aside I studied and searched.|`|2JbCMKNAaa	I left the Catholic Church to attend another Christian church.

Later I started studying Albert Einstein and became an agnostic, and now I'm an atheist.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Yes. I was raised a Christian. I started more intense Bible study. I started to realize the Bible couldn't be true. I researched more. I realized the Jews had a good point that Jesus could not be the Messiah. I researched more religions and realized they all were just a means to an end. After a few years of visiting houses of worship and counciling with religious leaders and studying and researching, I became Wiccan because it made most sense to me and felt right for my life.     And 18 years later, it still is.|`|eVBUkO7aaa	No I was born a Muslim and still continue to practice this religion today (I am now 25)|`|tdNaZ9qAaa	I didnt beilve in God at all .

I tried modern day christianity in the U.S even non denomination and was sickened by the lies and hypcrisy.    I kept looking and finally found the truth and answers that amde sense.    I studied the bible for 3 years with Jehovahs wittnesses and then became one.    I am finally happy and secure even in these crazy times the world is having.

BtFbHjHZaa	Sorry I believe in Celing Cat  todd m.|`|PbrGLvonaa	it is a "what if"    though if Islam is the true religion, then fine.    being it the true religion doesn't mean i'll follow it.|`|HnX6qyuGaa	I see that Islam is the true religion, I am muslim by choice ,     and thats for the following reasons that i found after study :     1- The view of Jesus and Mary in islam:    the view of jesus in islam is the best and the most reasonable as In islam jesus is looked at as a moderate view between two extreme views , jews humiliate jesus and his mother , whereas christians worship jesus and raise him above humanity this thing jesus denied and refused .  in the bible there has been altering but still there can be find from the bible ,, sayings of jesus that makes us know the truth  let us take an example of jesus saying "My God" in the bible, one can find that in alot of places in the bible like :   >>  and:  >>   and in alot of other places ..   notice the word -Our God - that jesus said this means that we have a common God we and jesus, God means creator this means we r both created and raised by the same God,, we as well as jesus     jesus always admitted and declared with hight Voice that he worships Our God that is in the heaven and invited us to worship him how can he be God after that    we always see jesus saying (my God) and praying to him why don't we just worship the God of jesus , that is; the creator of jesus  its amazing how jesus used to call God : (My God) and (Our God ) many times in the bible ,  God is the one who creats and rises that means jesus always used to say :  (my creator).  which agrees with islam view of jesus as human prophet and no more than that.    Mary   also mary is considered in islam ,  as a very great woman and the  purest woman on earth , but not as mother of God !! whom he had made pregnant !! , nor his gf!      HolySpirit  the holy spirit is considered as the head of angels and he it is called gebrael , but its not a part of God nor any divine , he is just a creation of the One and Only true God that is in heaven .      2- Upon reading quran i found many amazing facts  from those i found is scientific facts or miracles i will mention some of them:    Few miracles Of Quran   Big Bang  When describing the creation of the "heavens and the earth," the Qur'an states the theory of the "Big Bang" explosion at the start of it . the Qur'an says that "the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before they were aparted:   Quran (21:30) {Have not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We cloved them asunder}  [cloved them asunder means separated them].  and this was 1400 years before the discovery of the big bang theory.    Expansion of Universe   this amazing theory was discovered in the 20th century that the universe is continuing to expand after the big bang explosion,,   this idea ; that the universe is continuing to expand. was mentioned in quran 1430 years ago : {and The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are still expanding it} quran (51:47).      Conclusion:   finally and in conclusion... The concept of God taught by Islam is, the Supreme being who is uncreated , anyone who is  created,  born or dies is not God.     i found that islam is the only religion that claims absolute uniqness of God and really means it and thus islam is the only religion today that follow the first commandment of all commandments to moses and jesus and mohammed which is :     "For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, [is] a jealous God:" [Exodus 34:14]  and jesus said:  after one of the scribes asked him Which is the first commandment of all? Jesus answered him, "The first of all commandments is, Hear, O Israel The Lord our God is one Lord"   [Mark 12:28to33]   and in Quran :  "Say, He is God, The One and Only" (112:1)   amen.|`|EwbB1KaIaa	Some of the things peopel have said are untrue here!!  Islam is a relegion, and all the other relegions have similar teachings.  Islam in my opinion is a very big relegion.|`|VPeb2fuTaa	That depends on how you define "true religion."  If by that phrase, you mean "the only right religion," then a LOT of people are going to hell--about 80% of the world population, according to recent statistics.  If you mean "the religion containing the greatest amount of spiritual truth," then there's probably some leeway depending on how similar one's religious beliefs are to those of Islam.|`|0psxM4o4aa	This isn't a lottery.  True Religion is an oxymoron.  You don't die and see God and tell him, "I chose Islam," then he turns to you and says, "Show me Islam! BINGO, YOUR IN!"      When you die and you stand before God, it is your heart that He will look at.  He knows every decision you made and why you made it. He is fair and He is just!  Don't look for a religion.  Religion is man made, and is as fallable as anything man made.    Look only to the one who created a world where everything workd in perfect harmony, until man tries to take over God's role, and attempts to make "improvements."  Christ is the only way to God.  Not Islam, not catholic, not protestant, not muslim...etc.     Jesus once said, "I am the way the truth and the life.  No man comes to the Father except by Me."|`|KD7yA3wVaa	I don't think that islam is the right religion because it was created dy a man,and humans always lie.if someone said that they have never lied then they are a liar.If u were looking for a belief u should be a Christian u might say that Christianity was created by a human then u r wrong Gods son was in a form of a human and he came to earth to save us also what other belief or religion has miracle worker that is not magic tricks?also christianity is an easy belief... well at least i think so. u don't do the things that other religions do and there is different types of music just keep in mind that positive doen't mean christian.finally u don't have to go to a special school to become a christian and watch out for some churches because they might decieve u with their names like church of later day saints and church of Jesus Christ or white garment churches.|`|jnG8sOzWaa	but its not and will never be|`|EAuMJrs4aa	then i declare jihad on the people who made these yummy scrummy bacon crisps|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Than I'm gonna be rug seller.|`|IKyITYICaa	I want my 72 virgins!

The concept of "abrogation" in the Quran is that Allah chose to reveal ayat (singular ayah  means a sign or miracle, commonly a verse in the Quran) that supercede earlier ayat in the same Quran. The central ayah that deals with abrogation is Surah 2:106:    "None of Our revelations do We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, but We substitute something better or similar: Knowest thou not that Allah Hath power over all things?"    (Basically Allah changes his mind and contradicts himself whenever he pleases.  Great.)|`|faad926c43719d8181fa3e22a1c61fd6aa	I cant imagine a religion that inspires so much hatred in its followers to be correct|`|2LsR22g9aa	I think the true religion is masturbation.|`|rd6XkoG5aa	?|`|719261d758e0cebf5beeb6101b21166faa	Hard to imagine a being intelligent enough to create the cosmos and  hateful enough to create Islam.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Then they've done something that both Jews and Christians can agree is totally wrong :     Deuteronomy 29:29  The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.    Galatians 1  But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed. 9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.

So too when it comes to prayer, believing that there is a real and living God who can and does hear prayers is conducive to our speaking freely with him. In fact, it is important to have full faith that God is and that he is a rewarder of those earnestly seeking him. (Heb. 11:6) He who knows best and cares most is ever aware of our needs, even though they may vary widely for people living in different parts of the world. In a figurative sense Jehovah is near to all those calling upon him in faith, and is swift to respond to their need of help.Ps. 145:18.|`|ef7be53a8ea254bcecc8dd5838cbbbeaaa	How could you possibly know that?

Another requirement for being heard by God is to act in harmony with our prayers.  We must pray for things that are in harmony with God's will.  We should not only pray for ourselves but others.  Matthhew 6:10   We should open our heart to God and pray about specific things as a son would talk to a Father.  We should always give him praise and thank him when our prayers are answered.

Then you will say to Pharaoh,"..." 'Israel is my firstborn son'...'but you refused to let him go; now I will kill your firstborn son.' " Exodus 4:21-23   God forced the Egyptians to die.  An eye for an eye, huh?    The first Commandment, Thou shalt have no other idols "for I the Lord your God am a jealous God." Exodus 20:5   Hmm...I though jealousy was one of the seven sins.  No one ever seems to think God has any flaws.    I'm sure there are many more.  Maybe, in order for the world to be a more peaceful place, you should learn to accept the fact that others have different views on religion.

o4UrRbTvaa	"We were convinced that the people need and require this faith [Christianity]. We have therefore undertaken the fight against the atheistic movement, and that not merely with a few theoretical declarations: we have stamped it out."  ~ Adolf Hitler, in a speech in Berlin on 24 Oct. 1933 (This statement clearly refutes modern Christians who claim Hitler as favoring atheism.  Hitler wanted to form a society in which ALL people worshipped Jesus and considered any questioning of such to be heresy.  The Holocaust was like a modern inquisition, killing all who did not accept Jesus. Though more Jews were killed then any other it should be noted that MANY ARYAN pagans and atheists were murdered for their non-belief in Christ.)    The best characterization is provided by the product of this religious education, the Jew himself.  His life is only of this world, and his spirit is inwardly as alien to true Christianity as his nature two thousand years previous was to the great founder of the new doctrine.  Of course, the latter made no secret of his attitude toward the Jewish people, and when necessary he even took the whip to drive from the temple of the Lord this adversary of all humanity, who then as always saw in religion nothing but an instrument for his business existence.  In return, Christ was nailed to the cross, while our present- day party Christians debase themselves to begging for Jewish votes at elections and later try to arrange political swindles with atheistic Jewish parties-- and this against their own nation. ~ Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)    Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord.  ~ Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)      Edit: Fundies use the atheist line because they do not consider him a "true Christian" so that automatically makes him an "atheist".   It is their loophole.  Since the man has been dead for a long time now, nobody knows how he might have "actually" felt about any religion.  All we have to go on is his own recorded words.  And that is enough for me.  So unless anyone has a phone line to the dead, that should be enough for them too.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Hitler was a true christian: an activist who put personal trappings aside and worked hard to build the lord's work, much as Bush did with Abu Ghraib:    "We are doing the lord's work"-Bush in 06-2004 on Abu Ghriab.

Communism.The book Hitler's Secret Conversations 1941-1944 published by Farrar, Straus and Young, Inc.first edition, 1953, contains definitive proof of Hitler's real views. The book was published in Britain under the title, _Hitler's Table Talk 1941-1944, which title was used for the Oxford University Press paperback edition in the United States.     Here are some quotes you forgot:  National Socialism and religion cannot exist together.... The heaviest blow that ever struck humanity was the coming of Christianity. Bolshevism is Christianity's illegitimate child. Both are inventions of the Jew. The deliberate lie in the matter of religion was introduced into the world by Christianity.... Let it not be said that Christianity brought man the life of the soul, for that evolution was in the natural order of things. (p 6 & 7)     The best thing is to let Christianity die a natural death.... When understanding of the universe has become widespread... Christian doctrine will be convicted of absurdity.... Christianity has reached the peak of absurdity.... And that's why someday its structure will collapse.... ...the only way to get rid of Christianity is to allow it to die little by little.... Christianity  the liar.... We'll see to it that the Churches cannot spread abroad teachings in conflict with the interests of the State. (p 49-52)     Christianity is an invention of sick brains: one could imagine nothing more senseless, nor any more indecent way of turning the idea of the Godhead into a mockery.... .... When all is said, we have no reason to wish that the Italians and Spaniards should free themselves from the drug of Christianity. Let's be the only people who are immunised against the disease. (p 118 & 119)     It would always be disagreeable for me to go down to posterity as a man who made concessions in this field. I realize that man, in his imperfection, can commit innumerable errors-- but to devote myself deliberately to errors, that is something I cannot do. I shall never come personally to terms with the Christian lie. Our epoch Uin the next 200 yearse will certainly see the end of the disease of Christianity.... My regret will have been that I couldn't... behold ." (p 278)     I do insist on the certainty that sooner or later  once we hold power  Christianity will be overcome and the German Church established. Yes, the German church, without a Pope ....and Luther, if he could be with us, would give us his blessing. (Adolf Hitler, Hitlers speeches, edited by Prof. N.H. Baynes [oxford, 1942], pg. 369.)

He proclaimed his commitment to religious freedom, promising to treat Christian denominations with objective justice. As we know he persecuted the Jews and also Jehovah's Witnesses among others.  Clerics incited anti-Semitism for centuries. According to A History of Christianity, Hitler once remarked: As for the Jews, I am just carrying on with the same policy which the Catholic church had adopted for 1500 years.    More: Copies of the cablegram were sent to George Cardinal Mundelein of Chicago, William Cardinal OConnell of Boston, Dennis Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia, and Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani Apostolic Delegate to United States at Washington.    Adolph Hitler, it read in part, was born of Catholic parents, was baptized a Catholic, and was reared and educated as such. While publicly by his words, deeds and orders he has become the worlds greatest menace to Christianity, and to civilization, he has not publicly up to the present time declared himself outside of the Church of his parents, and has not repudiated his membership therein, thus remaining subject to the laws and discipline of the Church.    Firmly believing that the pronouncing of excommunication upon Adolph Hitler will help the cause of freedom, Christianity, Humanity, and civilization at this time, we hereby respectfully plead, appeal, and petition your Holiness publicly to proclaim and impose excommunication of Adolph Hitler.    One of the speakers at a mass meeting declared: we petition to make saints, thus recognizing the power of the Papacy. If such action holds good there, why not here? Included in the organizations represented at the meeting were units of the Polish National Alliance, branches of the Polish Roman Catholic Unions, and its joint Committee of Slovak organizations.

NYU37jfGaa	In england the monarchy had always been subject to the rule of law, ever since the days when King John was made to sign the Magna Carta.  We never had a monarch who had the same degree of individual power as the French kings.  The King needed to call parliament if, say he wanted to pass a new law or impose new taxes or something.  When King Charles I attempted to rule without parliament, it sparked the Civil War.    The French kings had something more akin to an absolute monarchy than the English, but they too called their parliament, The Estates General, from time to time.  In 'The Cambridge Illustrated History of France', colin Jones writes:    'In 1302 Philip the Fair formally convened the three estates of the realm - clergy, Nobility, and Third Estate, or town representatives".  A sounding-boardof and intelligence gahterer of some importance, the Estates formed a pragmatic means of consulting the wider political communit, in order to acquire, maybe even to manufacture, consent for royal policy.'    I think in both England and France the rulers saw parliament as a way to get the consent of the people for what they wanted to do, but they were capable of trying to impose their will(not always successfully) if the people opposed it.

The owner of the shop stomping away on it, while a bunch of 14 year old girls (chavs) shout abuse.    I've never encounterd any violent attacks from them, so this explains why i was brave enough to storm up to them and give them a lecture.   Lets just say i was lucky i still went home in one piece.    Little sh!ts.    But yeah, I might be more afraid of the redneck if they have a gun.   However, chavs usually have bucky bottles 'tae tann yer face in pal' so..... Lets just say i'd rather steer clear of all violent types.

ohKKJAi4aa	Besides what Ben has posted, she was the first female Pharaoh of Egypt and she has the most unique tomb in all of Egypt that I believe she designed herself.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Probably her most famous achievement is the fact that she had herself declared Pharoah, assuming all of the office's masculine titles and masculine attire, which was an unusual step for a woman to take at her time. She had been acting as regent for her nephew and stepson Thutmosis III, and just seems to have decided to take over.  In 'The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody', Will Cuppy writes:    'Hatshepsut came as quite a surprise to the Egyptians, who had gone along thinking that it's a man's world. It is, with certain exceptions.    Hatshepsut allowed Thutmosis III to keep his title of Pharoah and act as junior co-ruler.  That is, she would let him burn incense in her honour, feed her herd of pet cows, run errands, and have his name on the monuments after her own, in smaller hieroglyphs."    She had an impressive temple built for herself  at Deir-el-Bahri, Thebes.  Reliefs on the walls of the shrine portray her fictional divine birth as the daughter of Amon and her right to rule Egypt.  She also restored her father's temple at Thebes and introduced four obelisks nearly 100 feet tall.    One of her most famous endeavours is her trading expedition to Punt, which brought back gold, ivory, myrrh, and new botanical and zoological specimens, including baboons and live myrrh trees.    For much of her reign, she was very close to her chief steward Senenmut, and there has been some speculation that he may have been her lover.  He was also honoured for his architcectural skills, and was involved in her building projects.  Will Cuppy says:    "She had seen him first when her husband Thutmose II was still alive and had made a memo in case she ever wanted any new architecture.  When and where they met is uncertain, but one evening shortly after the funeral they were noticed loitering in the sacred sycamore grove as if they had some important buildings in mind, and the next morning Senmut was appointed Chief of the royal Works."|`|aBqJhdufaa	She ruled Egypt. And BTW it's pronounced "KetchupSoup" trust me.|`|6G973YWvaa	Hatshepsut (or Hatchepsut, IPA: /h?t???ps?t/),[3] meaning, Foremost of Noble Ladies,[4] was the fifth pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty of Ancient Egypt. She is generally regarded by Egyptologists as one of the most successful pharaohs, reigning longer than any other woman of an indigenous Egyptian dynasty.    Although contemporary records of her reign are documented in diverse ancient sources, Hatshepsut was described by early modern scholars as only having served as a co-regent from about 1479 to 1458 B.C., during years seven to twenty-one of the reign previously identified as that of Thutmose III.[5] Today it is generally recognized that Hatshepsut assumed the position of pharaoh and the length of her reign usually is given as twenty-two years, since she was assigned a reign of twenty-one years and nine months by the third-century B.C. historian, Manetho, who had access to many records that now are lost. Her death is known to have occurred in 1458 B.C., which implies that she became pharaoh circa 1479 B.C.
lh8Tn02Naa	Everyone should read Catcher at least once in their life.  Last time I did it was well before you were born and it still haunts me.    You can't read the Bible in the same way.  For a start, it isn't one book.  Parts of it - 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings - are straightforward narrative and contain quite a lot of history.  Jonah is a tall story,  Jeremiah was a misery-guts, Ezekiel was crazy, the later parts of Isaiah are visionary and wonderful, Chronicles will bore you to tears, the Psalms are for worship, Proverbs is repetitive, and so on.  A lot of it is very nationalistic: Jews are great, screw everyone else.     The Gospels read relatively easily and can beguile you into thinking you have understood them.  You haven't, not at 13.  In ten years' time you might have begun to realize what strange books they are and how remote from our culture, but some Christians go all through their lives and never see this.  At least Paul's letters don't FEEL easy to understand.  I'd avoid Revelation entirely as you need help to make sense of it.  And at your age you ought to avoid the Song of Songs cos it's, well, rude.    Having said all of which you should try to read some of the Bible if only to understand why it has had such a huge influence on Western culture.  Believe it or don't believe it, you need to know what's in it.|`|BPcdVahWaa	Neither is good.

I read about 3 different books.|`|AA11992885	i think you should read the texts, but you must FIRST realize certain factors    what came first is first, so start with Genesis    and if God says FOREVER or FOR EVERY GENERATION, anything else is a lie    if God were to declare a law to be FOREVER, but then 1500 years later, decides to change it.........God then lied, as that law was not forever, but for a limited time..........and God being all knowing, would have known that it was going to be changed, and thus, by saying forever, HE knowingly lied    thus, you have to be able to recognize the very real possibility that HUMANS can add books that don't belong|`|qs2LyiM6aa	no dont read the bible it is rubbish|`|Gp160xHOaa	Of course you should it is important to your life.When I was thirteen I know I didnt have much interest in reading the whole thing of course.Try reading like Romans and Revelations.|`|ZOsdAyrjaa	The Bible's one of the most violent, gory, sexual, books out there, and it has a good ending. Based on some of today's tastes, people would really like it. apart from just describing what's in it, it's the most unique book in the world, and I'm sure you can learn some good advice from reading it (proverbs especially). I also happen to think that you can get at least a little bit more out of it than that, but people don't like to hear that lol ;)|`|hIaBgCrgaa	this is another phony posting i dont believe it.|`|O0k4sieJaa	Of Corse ! Jesus gave you life and all things you can do on it! In the holy bible it tells you to do things that are important. It really doesn't matter what age you are, as long as you can read! READ THE HOLY BIBLE!  It tells you sin and how you can make it to Heven! Don't you want to go to Heven because hell is not a great place to go, Just saying! The Cather and the Rye is not a life saver it is not a resource that will help you be a better person, it won't get you to the places you want to go! I think i made it clear what you should read if not here something: The Bible is god book, and it does not lie to you so READ THE HOLY BIBLE!It will make a diffrence in your life! Trust me it will be worth it!|`|vddPsXzIaa	When I was in your age, I read the Bible (it was practically forbidden in my country) and it changed my life. It's a serious thing to read if you are ready for it. The catcher in the... is just fiction. Good fiction though. The difference is that you read the Bible every time like a new book. Every time you understand it better and it's an endless process.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	While CATCHER IN the Rye is a classic novel, it will not aid you in becoming a good functioning adult woman.  The Bible will.    How life came to earth or where you came from.  What qualities do you need to not only survive but thrive as an adult in your community.  You might think of having a family.  The Bible shows how to have a good family life and raise children like you that you could be proud of.    You can see at 13 how corrupt and evil this system of things (commercial, political and religious areas) is and how we must live in it for now.  Relief from this is promised in the Bible.  More importantly for yourself, how you can get free from this and live under paradise conditions with yourself in perfect health.    Surely you know of people infirm and sickly.  Under God's Kingdom rule, there will be none of this anymore.  The Bible shows how you can live into this time.  Certainly beats Catcher in the Rye.|`|a7pCUHoiaa	Depends...    Do you want to feel guilty for being a normal teenage girl? if you do, then feel free to read the Bible!    Then again, if you find you believe what it says, then (aside from the constant confusion and emotional tumoil known as "difficulties on the Christian path") you might enjoy being close to God. It will make you both humble and conceited at the same time... = )    Funny, I'm wearing a t-shirt right now that says "Humble, but still the best" xD|`|7vk4xoKZaa	I would suggest reading The Stranger by John R. Cross - it pretty much sums the bible up and includes all of the important points if you are actually serious about it. I just read it and I really enjoyed it. It also explains things very well that I would not have understood from just going to the bible and reading it.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Do both.  The Bible is not a "read", Catcher in the Rye is.|`|0yTM98Odaa	The Holy Bible, read it|`|8fp5dSW4aa	The Catcher and the Rye was an amazing book. Really boring, but more exciting and realistic then the Bible|`|AA11690436	I think Catcher in the Rye would speak more to what you're going through right now.  However, regardless of your religious beliefs, you should read the bible before you complete your education.  The ideas, images and allusions therein are one of the cornerstones of Western Art and Literature, and not knowing the fountain that is the source for so much in the intellectual history of the West will deprive you of being able to fully appreciate such works as Milton, or Chaucer, or Shakespeare, or even Modern Authors like John Steinbeck.|`|29X6EEsKaa	Even being an atheist, you can't say that the Bible isn't a good read. However, it's numbering system confused me for a while, and it's fairly high level reading. Unless your a really good reader.    I haven't read Catcher in the Rye.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Read "The Catcher in the Rye" instead.|`|IIhiSprlaa	I wouldn't.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	if you have to choose between those 2  The Catcher in the Rye  definitely|`|qvcZW7pxaa	read both.  just don't take either of them literally, as i hate to say it but they are both interesting and well written works of fiction.|`|89MKzLl3aa	If you want to be taken seriously in a debate on religion, you need to read the bible.|`|ibAJ0YiMaa	What would you like to get out of the book?  Would you like to go to heaven or just be entertained for the moment?|`|HikylB4Taa	This is not a question you should have asked on yahoo, there are a million people that could persuaade you to do things you shouldn't...follow the right path and read the Bible, it is in many ways this worlds only truth! God bless and good luck! Oh, you may need a companion Bible to help you understand the hard parts.|`|0IjomiJ2aa	The Bible is a much better read.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	you should be reading real books at the library instead|`|pfOt0qKkaa	Read Jurassic Park instead.|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	Read twilight, it is more interesting than both of those...wow  a lot of people hate mine, she's 13 twilight is more appropriate for her age group, people....|`|NSuilHx1aa	yes!!! it could change your life|`|AA10351261	The Bible? Yes. Please, by all means-read it.|`|VjDNLUIRaa	The Bible is too many Chinese Whispers, passed down over time and no one is sure what is true.|`|O7SshRl6aa	You should read both the bible and Catcher in the Rye.  You should read the bible because you should be familiar with the stories for your literature classes on down the road of your school career.  In stories like "Moby Dick" there are biblical references that if you understand them, you will have a better understanding of the book.  It is worth your time to know the major stories of the bible.  You'll be able to write better essays on tests.    You should read Catcher in the Rye because it is a great book.|`|KIzrFkYAaa	Yes!!! Even if you do not believe in what the Bible says- it is a MAGNIFICENT piece of literature! The best piece of literature out there. And it has all genres combined into one.... Historical, Lyrical, Poems, Songs, Romance, Adventure, Friendship, Futuristic, Non-Fiction and not to mention it can really encourage, inspire and help you throughout your day!! I STRONGLY encourage anyone of any age to read it... it will only help you :)|`|VjmTK6uZaa	You can read both.  Im a christian and have not read the whole bible, yet im only 18.  But I have also read the cather in the rye, which was a great book honestly.  But I use that book to relfect upon my life and see why im a christian.  The guy in the catcher in the rye is always depressed (youll see what I mean, he sais it every other page) I used this book to reflect on my life and how much God has helped me cope through my teenage years.|`|0bOSZIzJaa	Read it, but pay attention to it.  Read it like you would every other book and remember that the things written in it are a glimpse into the minds of men 2 and 3 thousand years ago.  Try to think about what we know about the universe and compare it to what the bible says about the universe.  Also, pay attention to the violence and cruelty throughout the bible.|`|AA12341493	There both centered around lying. The bible is filled with lies, Catcher is calling out the liers.     Catcher is a great read.|`|118a9de9a36251bb74bbae6622c162f9aa	The bible is long and boring and nothing but children stories and metaphors.     Please read something else before the fanatics suck you in.|`|GqNZInUbaa	read ,read, read, that is how you will gain knowledge..........and if you want a true understanding of God --yes read the bible----read it any way|`|yHD5wVopaa	I'd say read the Bible first. Where else can you find such epic battles, skillful poetry, heroic figures, bizarre traditions, and wonderful proverbs? It's a very important book in human history, it tells us a lot about the world in which the Israelites lived. Just try not to take it literally in places where it's not intended to be.     (of course, I'm not saying don't ever read The Catcher in the Rye. Try to read any book you can. Knowledge is power!)|`|aPuUuWlLaa	You should read both in time. I don't personally believe the Bible is non fiction but it is a huge influence in culture and there are many literary references to its stories in other literature. You should decide for yourself by reading it and perhaps the works of both its supporters and critics. The Catcher In the Rye is also considered by many to be a literary classic. Its something that many alienated and rebellious teenagers find something to relate to. The story revolves around a young man who is disillusioned and cynical of his fellow humans and having trouble growing up and taking responsibility for himself. He uses his disillusion and fear of growing up to justify self destructive behavior. Its a complex work with more to it then that so also a worthy read.
gDVQNMR7aa	I don't celebrate any holidays that are considered by the masses to be "Christian". I am aware that they are not. As for having the days off from work- my place of employment closes and gives everyone the holidays off and I can't change that.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Not really. I realize that Christmas and Easter have pagan roots, but they also have Christian elements in them. I mean, what's the matter with celebrating Jesus' birth/resurrection?     The only holiday I really have an issue with is Halloween, but no days off there. :P|`|LUGWyWrLaa	No Because at Chrsitmas I am celebrating the birth of my Savior no matter what anyone else is celebrating.  At Easter I am celebrating His resurection.  Regardless of anything anyone wants to make up that is could be besides that.|`|AA10351261	Define PAGAN.  Is the  Martin Luther King holiday a pagan thing? I don't think so. Thanksgiving, 4th of July, Memorial Day??  Nope.

And that is not for the sae reasons Pagans did. Sorry if we took something|`|LqetdhxBaa	Though it is true that Easter and Christmas are pagan festivals, they are enforced by secular authority.    Yes. Christmas was the birthday of the sun.    These doctrines were made by the Roman Catholic Church and have since stuck on.    If you are trying to make an issue of this, please discuss it with your pastor or if you are non-religious, your teacher/lecturer/local pastor/local priest|`|52JF62fzaa	I am Pagan, and last I check..... They are not on the same days.  Christmas Dec 25 - Christians Holiday  Yule Winter Solstice Dec 21 - Pagans Holiday  As with Easter too.  I know their traditions have Pagan roots, but they are not on the same day, nor are they celebrated the same way.  Do some more research hun.  I think you may be confused about somethings.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	No and usually the work places close so there is really no option but to take it off so I'm not sure how you can be a hyprocrite for someone closing their business on a holiday.|`|dmCAiuMGaa	Yawn.  Those are Christian holidays, unless they changed the name on Dec. 25 to Paganmas and I missed it in the news.    So that makes me non-hypocritical.    EDIT:  Based on the response above mine, you need to check your calendar and get your facts straight before you post, so as not to embarrass yourself with dumb questions.|`|AA11923447	No. I grew up attending Christian schools, and of course, we were taught about the pre-Christian roots of many Christian holidays, symbols, and rituals. I do not feel guilty about taking any day off work. Also, there are nature-based rites that I personally observe (celebrating solstices, full moons and so forth) that I don't get any time off for to begin with. If a company gives people time off, I say let them enjoy it, regardless of their religion (or lack thereof).|`|cLgghhuXaa	No. (It would be nice if you gave some examples.)    I am aware of pagan traditions in Christmas and the name of Easter. But I do not celebrate Yule, or worship the goddess associated with Easter so...|`|GCl84SPLaa	I always work on holidays. I don't like holidays.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	lame question|`|SGSl5yeAaa	Easter is a time to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus, and Christmas his birth.  Easter should be accurate as it coincides around the time of Passover, but Christmas is a toss-up.  Regardless, I don't care what day it occurs on, I just take the time to celebrate the birth of my savior.|`|8fp5dSW4aa	I'm not Christian, but if they can get a vacation for stupid s**t that didn't happen, then I think I have just as much a right to do the same|`|89MKzLl3aa	No, because I don't worship them, and I don't tell people to abhor them. My husband can stay home with me which I like.
e739a2c4e1e2dcb4dfddc6736311a5ceaa	Bis! = Encore!|`|KS2OHXCRaa	Bise(s) - also written as biz (slang, informal) - means kiss(es). Or sometimes some people use bisous, which is more of a pet word.    These are words commonly used in ending a friendly email, or short messages, or even over the phone to end the conversation (e.g. "bisous, tchao tchao" - which is "kisses, bye bye"). Just like the way if two friends meet in person, they would greet each other or say goodbye by giving kisses on the cheeks. ;)

When we failed > in the Person of Jesus Christ      We have a Home in His plan with Him forever>everyone has a place there...if They Love and Obey God.    2 Corinthians  Chapter 5    1      For we know that if our earthly dwelling, 1 a tent, should be destroyed, we have a building from God, a dwelling not made with hands, eternal in heaven.  2      2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be further clothed with our heavenly habitation  3      if indeed, when we have taken it off, 3 we shall not be found naked.  4      For while we are in this tent we groan and are weighed down, because we do not wish to be unclothed 4 but to be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.  5      Now the one who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a first installment. 5   6      6 So we are always courageous, although we know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,  7      for we walk by faith, not by sight.  8      Yet we are courageous, and we would rather leave the body and go home to the Lord.  9      Therefore, we aspire to please him, whether we are at home or away.  10      For we must all appear 7 before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive recompense, according to what he did in the body, whether good or evil.  11      8 Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade others; but we are clearly apparent to God, and I hope we are also apparent to your consciousness.  12      We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you an opportunity to boast of us, so that you may have something to say to those who boast of external appearance rather than of the heart.  13      For if we are out of our minds, 9 it is for God; if we are rational, it is for you.  14      10 For the love of Christ impels us, once we have come to the conviction that one died for all; therefore, all have died.  15      He indeed died for all, so that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.  16      Consequently, 11 from now on we regard no one according to the flesh; even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him so no longer.  17      So whoever is in Christ is a new creation: the old things have passed away; behold, new things have come.  18      12 And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and given us the ministry of reconciliation,  19      namely, God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting their trespasses against them and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.  20      So we are ambassadors for Christ, as if God were appealing through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.  21      13 For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin, so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.       http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2corinthi...|`|IYBTmH26aa	God created us spiritually incomplete.  We are not yet full spiritual bodies.      The last spirit body, Lucifer, screwed up royally.      God's plan is to have us become a part of His eternal family in His Coming Kingdom to Earth. Lucifer was originally the one who was supposed to rule on this Earth.  We were going to be under his jurisdiction.    Since Lucifer screwed up those plans badly, God was going to assign the dominion of the Earth to someone else.  Angels seemed to suck at it.  So how about humans.  We are no yet spiritually complete.    God has to make sure that if He's going to live with us for eternity, He doesn't keep the royal screw ups.  So we are tested against whom...Satan.     I don't know about you, but imagine an eternity with your worst ex-wife or husband.  Not even God can handle that and He endures many, many things.      God gives us a book to follow, the Bible, also as a test of our obedience.  We either obey God and follow His mercifully fruitful ways or we follow Satan and look for the short cut in life.  Take from others to support ourselves.      That's not enough to last eternity, and it's definitely not the type of person God wants in the Kingdom.  Think of it this way.  If you lived in a mansion with the hottest Lamborghini on the market and you wanted a roommate, would you invite the thief or would or the mechanic who's fixed the Lamb for you consistently, allowing it to last beyond it's years?    We are weak.  We need God.  Yet, God is not going to drag us to the Kingdom.  He doesn't want weak, lazy, selfish, self-righteous, celibate, overly proud, overly Zealous, overly religious mucksters in His Kingdom.  So he's got a set of rules we need to abide by,     In that Kingdom, we would have the ability to judge (like judge, judge) angels, including bad spirits and demons. They're angels, too.  Fallen angels.     WOuldn't it be better if God made us indestructable.  I'd say so, but then you can't really respond to robots, either.  God wants an active working relationship with us in the same way we would want a working relationship with our close friends and relatives.  Yet, at the same time, we need to respect authority and know our places.  It's no different than what we were expected to do on Earth.     However, since we sinned and screwed up like the Devil, we lost the ability to run the earth after Satan. So God is sending Christ instead who was kind enough to pay some huge sins we racked up with his sinless death.    In other words, Jesus had good spiritual credit and ours sucked.  We would have been in danger of spiritual bankruptcy (eternal death) had Jesus not forked over his credit for us.  So He gets to run the Kingdom.  That's why He's coming back a second time. He's manages His spirituality better.      However, those of us who are managing our spiritual affairs will also get to rule with Him as kings and Queens.  That's why Christ is the King of kings.|`|IMglb5ITaa	God is not surprised or blaming. He is forgiving.

His theory involves studying Biblical (and related) texts, takes into account the Knights Templars and is generally an enjoyable read.    I know that he has his critics because he sometimes puts 2 & 2 together to make 5, but ( to continue the analogy), normal historians put 1 & 1 together to make 4!    Hancock is a very good, enthusiastic writer, and you can tell reading this book that he has become somewhat obsessive.  The way he puts it together though, it's as exciting to read as watching Indian Jones!    I know there was a TV programme on just before Christmas that also looked for the Ark, and I think that they came to the same answer - The Ark of the Covenant is in Ethiopia, held by The Ethiopian Orthodox Church in 'The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion'.
wRiVVOwnaa	your word order is correct, but it should spell:    ...obwohl ich die Kunstgalerie vorziehe.'    and if you want to use the plural as in your English example it should be:    ...obwohl ich Kunstgalerien vorziehe.'|`|01NUrwfYaa	yes the conjugation makes it go to the end of the sentence... so it's corrext how you have it.  X)    you might have to say vorziehe not sure..    also    *only in a dependent clause    so if you start with    conjunction + subject + verb, verb + subject etc.    or ver + subject, conjunction + subject + verb.

yijmoNbSaa	Organization.    The STATE of Louisiana wasn't prepared for Katrina.  Some could argue that nor was D.C. prepared for hurricane Latrina, i.e. the Obama inauguration.  LA had liberal, left wing leaders when Katrina struck, and we had a president who didn't believe we needed to go in there with guns blazing.  He approached the issue with the idea of letting the people of Louisiana solve the problems themselves.  The Feds would go in to help in Louisiana, only.|`|5SR5Hyfeaa	True :)  laugh people, its just funny ; Don't take everything so stinking serious !

I'm guessing your question is basically "Why could they get into D.C. in one day, but they couldn't escape Hurricane Katrina in 4 days?"  That's a good question. Except for the whole "black people" thing, it was people in general. That was a little racist... =/    My guess? People in New Orleans didn't want to leave their homes to be destroyed.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Sounds like a bad racist joke posing as a question.|`|IUlIixJLaa	Free food and attention?|`|0IjomiJ2aa	what an asinine and racist question|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Since "asinine and racist" were already used, I'll say that this is a 'mean-spirited and pointless' question.
cIwTdSvDaa	You are so screwed!!!!!! Do not believe what they are telling you. You can not "shop" around for black greek letter organizations. If you were not sure which to pledge, you should do your research privately before showing interest AND before you pledge and are put on line!!! If you even had an inkling that you wanted to Pledge Kappa you should have researched and done pros and cons for both organizations privately. You disrespect the people in the organization and yourself for not being true to it. SO either you commit and find something that you can admire about the organization or DROP Out and leave it alone! You will be blackballed on yard and in future pledging if you try to switch back and forth...take this from those that know about the pledging process....|`|YcDWkfTVaa	The president of Kappa Alpha Psi is clearly messing with you..

But do understand that you do not have a future as a Kappa.. And you have wastes the time of so many people.|`|xNNFF8YAaa	kappa.     if ur in   Omega, you will most likely be blamed for stuff    but kappa, you seem like the good kids....       idk/.... sorta a personal choice though right?|`|gwTppxcYaa	do kappa...great parties...and they r pretty cool guys...i knw a few|`|AA12186207	It doesn't matter what we think.

Remember these are going to be your brothers throughout your whole college experience and even beyond. Join the fraternity that you want to, because you like the people in it, not because it is the coolest on campus.   When I was going to college the in your face, we are the best fraternities, usually had the biggest douche bags in them. The Kappa fraternity seems like the better choice of the two

Such verbs also exist in English, known as phrasal verbs, like "to give up", "to carry on", to get along", etc. You can see that the meaning really has little to do with the verbs "to give", "to carry" and "to get"|`|NQIKCGgfaa	Jane is right.

mBHQEzd1aa	If I had to I would.  I wouldn't want to kill just to kill. When I was a kid we ate a lot of food my father hunted or fished.  We use to go to a place where they had chickens in crates too and pick out our Sun. supper and they would kill it for us and we'd take it home and cook it.  I've plucked many a quail my husband hunted and we ate it.  Today the waters in so many lakes are polluted I don't know if I'd want to eat fish out of it.

Everyone's morals are different, and my morals are that I do not eat animals or anything made from them.  And no, I'm not "stick thin." That is a common and completely false misconception. Being vegan/vegetarian is actually many times healthier than omnivores could ever hope to be. It's advised as the healthiest diet (so long as you're not eating all junk food, aka french fries, which are vegetarian) by doctors, medical professionals, anyone properly educated in health.

Bereshet is filled with easier words and phrases, and it gets incrementally harder.      Id probably go with the Amidah for those purposes. But you'd need a siddur.    Go to shul. I'm sure they wont mind if you study out of one of their siddurs for a few hours. Also, look around. Ask your friends. I even found a few old siddurs in used bookstores and libraries. Those are often cheap (although they have little in the way of translation).    Also, look on the internet. I'm sure you can find hebrew transcripts for tefilah there.

A Baptist who believes that it is only bread and wine doesn't believe in communion as we do, so he/she couldn't participate. That doesn't mean that he/she is not a Christian, of course.|`|29THwRZuaa	When i went to church with school we were allowed to take both, i thought that was the tradition "body and blood"?   If your church does not let you maybe you should ask them?|`|eBwICYUMaa	you can take the wine or bread if you don't go there but your only supposed to take it if you've gone through first communion|`|Z5TuccoIaa	our church offers it to anyone you do not have to be a member, I go to a Full Gospel church like a Assembly of God.    only requirement is to be a believer not have to join the church just believe.    Jesus said : 1Cr 11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake [it], and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.        1Cr 11:25 After the same manner also [he took] the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink [it], in remembrance of me.     :26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.     :27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink [this] cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.    it is in in "remembrance of him" it does not save you it is so we don't forget what he done for us.|`|6lk6TYohaa	Ive never been to any church where you have to be a member to participate, anytime i visit one and its communion guests are invited to join should they desire|`|FnE7BiYJaa	Jesus gave the supernatural ability of the descendents or relegators of His church to turn the bread and wine into His body and blood. He also was specific as to what sacraments the partakers must pass to be worthy of this sacrament. This is why only Catholics who have made their First Holy Communion and are free from mortal sin may take communion.|`|5ciDai7Paa	Because the bread symbolizes the body and wine the blood of God, and the church wants to make sure you believe in it before taking part in their specific sacred communion. It is just a way of perceiving their traditions and to show respect to Gods blood and body as to give it to those they know truly do believe in God.|`|AA10034051	In the Catholic Church one has to believe in the true presence of Jesus Christ to partake of the Eucharist. The bread and the wine is the true presence of Jesus Christ, not just a symbol as many protestants believe. One also needs to be in a state of grace. Which means that one has gone to confession and received absolution for their sins    Paul wrote to the Corinthians: "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?" (1 Cor. 10:16). So when we receive Communion, we actually participate in the body and blood of Christ, not just eat symbols of them. Paul also said, "Therefore whoever eats the bread and drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. . . . For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself" (1 Cor. 11:27, 29). "To answer for the body and blood" of someone meant to be guilty of a crime as serious as homicide. How could eating mere bread and wine "unworthily" be so serious? Pauls comment makes sense only if the bread and wine became the real body and blood of Christ.|`|SsSIbFhcaa	For Baptists there is no requirement for membership to take communion. The only requirement is that you have accepted Christ as your savior. Since that is between you and God it is your responsibility to ensure you are right with him before you do.    There is an additional direction that goes with communion though and that is the fact that you need to be in good relations with those around you, or as the bible puts it your brother.    If there is something between you and another you are directed to leave the communion at the alter and go and resolve your problems first then come back and partake.    This part is not a "requirement" but more on the order of a directive as I pointed out. The sin in our lives must be dealt with before we come to God and take the communion.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	The Catholic Church has closed Communion because we believe that you must understand that you are receiving the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Most other denominations regard Communion as merely symbolic or a memorial, but to Catholics, the Holy Eucharist is the Real Presence of Christ.    And as the term suggests, you must also be in complete accord with your fellow Catholic believers: i.e., the Communion of Saints. Since there is no way of knowing what a non-Catholic believes about the Eucharist or how much they agree with the Church's teachings, allowing only baptized and Confirmed Catholics to receive Communion is how the sanctity of the Sacrament is preserved.|`|bsHkZH1kaa	you can take either or both at any Catholic Church.  Just make sure that wheat don't make you sick; if wheat makes you sick; call the Church ahead of time and they will get this other type of bread for the people or just for you if you can't eat wheat.      I have to take both; it's a rule for men who are studying to become priests or who are priests.     oh, Holy Communion is no symbol; it's the real body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Just ask some french doctors in France who had to study a few of the Hosts in a lab; because some bad guy messed with the hosts and luckily they were blessed and became his actual flesh and a few did bleed.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	also you must be a baptised catholic, and be free of mortal sin, all others can approach the priest for a blessing|`|rUEvI0VPaa	you can take it at any church, i think people only don't take it if they haven't decided if they accept the teachings of Jesus.|`|OyOQES3paa	is that really the truth??? god i have been doing the wrong thing all my life i guess......... holy crap im going to hell..........|`|Npnza6ICaa	it depends on the church and the religion. like at St. Patrick's cathedral here in nyc you can take communion even if you're not a member but you do have to be catholic. but there are other churches that let you take them as long as you've been baptized. it all depends. hope this helps!|`|IP8vzLuBaa	At our church anyone can take communion as long as you are a believer.|`|dTdLrjFNaa	Because they believe that you have to be one when you take communion, and they believe that you can be cursed if you take it with the wrong mindset.

I think it only has to do with your religion and not where you go.  I could be wrong cause things change but I know as a catholic I can go to church in Florida or Ohio and have communion.  I do remember a kid from grade school who could ONLY take communion from a priest.  Our church was big so there were other people who handed it out so I remember him having to go to the line with the priest.|`|8IyZphFVaa	i don't know. i think it's completely stupid though. i grew up in a church and i got baptized and was taking communion there. it was a different denomination from the church i started going to when i was a teenager, but it was still christian. when i asked for communion, the pastor kind of laughed and said that i had to get baptized. when i told her i had already been baptized and already was taking communion and was still allowed to take communion whenever i went back to the other church, she said i had to get baptized at their church. when i asked about the whole issue of getting baptized twice, she just played it off and acted like she had something to do. i didn't think it would be right to get baptized again because then it would be like i was saying that the first time i was lying or i went back on my "promise." anytime i asked anyone from the church about the issue they couldn't explain themselves so i left the church.

In Islam it is taught that God has created these different religions, races and cultures so we can all get along in one world.  I believe in peace - one day this world will unite as one human race.|`|AA11595906	There's no profit in that|`|07f7853a89aa3cda6f880c27d1d66e86aa	In order to believe in God, we need to know what to believe about God, otherwise we are just making up our own powerless idol, which is what so many cultures have and worship...things made by their own hands, or things contrived by their own understanding, not the Almighty God Who is Divine Perfection but an idea of a god based upon flawed human perception. Also in order to obey God  and do what is truly right, we need to understand what God's purpose is for our existence and we need to know what is right. Again, if we just make up anything we "think" "should" be right, then we are just using our own perception to determine right and wrong which is called relativism. If God is real, then that means there is an absolute righteous standard of Good, and anything that goes against what is Good, is absolutely wrong. This is why God gave us the written testimony of His will for our lives.    If God is real, then it is our primary responsibility to seek God, because if He is real then there is no more important thing we can do in this life than be sure we know God, our Creator.     Despite what many want to believe, God has given us His word, His Commandments, and what is required of us. He tells us plainly and truly all we need to know in order to be saved, not by our power or our good deeds, but by His Grace and Mercy, His power, so no one can ever boast that they are somehow better or more deserving than any other person. How "good" a person is compared to another human being is irrelevant...Our only comparison of goodness is ours to God's Perfect Goodness, and we all fall so far from the mark that it is inconceivable.    If you seek the truth you will find it, but most people don't want the truth, they want what they think makes them happy and they do not want to be responsible for their actions, and if God is real, then we are responsible for every action we ever make, and because of this desire to deny guilt and not be accountable, more people will miss God than those who will truly find and accept His will for their lives.    It is very important to know God and if you study the tenets of faith for each of the major religions on the planet, the truth, if you truly seek it, will be found.     Just remember, there can only be one true faith, because every single one of the major religions contradict each other. Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism all disagree 100% on core doctrine. If one of these religions is true, then all the others "must" be false. Take the time and do the research and ask God to help you see the truth and He will.    Take Care and God Bless you.
ncdTxID9aa	Yes I agree, kids are being given the idea that gifts are what's important.  I think because that's when they receive their most favorite or desired item they wanted.  If they haven't had it all year but were promised it, then they expect to get that.  Also kids influence each other on what is cool or not, so when their parents hear what their kids want, they usually or eventually get it for them. Kids comply with the real message of Christmas just to be sure they get what it is they really want.  If there was no Christmas for them, the real message won't matter to them.  I think parents are scared to do just that, unless they were giving their kids gifts later during January.      Yes I've always looked forward to getting what I want, I was thankful but my gifts were very important to me, lol.  Once I turned 17 I didn't care so much for the gifts but I've always celebrating Christmas with family and even contribute gifts myself.|`|p8Mc6rpBaa	I will not get into the true meaning of Christmas. The date that we recognize as December 25th has been a day of celebration thousands of years before Christianity. Nevertheless the key word in this question in my opinion is "Giving". As children especially in America Christmas is absolutely magical. The thought of waking up in the middle of the night or the wee hours of the morning to find a brand new bike or easy bake oven under the tree is so exciting it's intoxicating. For many children it is the most joyous day of the year. As a parent there is nothing quite like seeing your children light up with joy and excitement over their gift.       In adding to that tradition parent should teach their children the virtuous joy that comes from giving gifts as well. It is up to parents to teach children that there are many children that don't experience the same elation and joy they do when they receive gifts because many children don't receive anything.  This is truly heartbreaking. This is why the tradition of Secret Santa is important. I don't know how many schools still do this now but when I was in school we exchanged gifts every year before Christmas break. Unbeknown to me I'm sure for some of those children it was the only gift they received.       Children don't truly understand the meaning of Christmas nor do they really care. Also different people celebrated Christmas in different ways. Still in all as stated before it is up to parents to teach children the importance of giving as well as receiving.

I think abortion is murder, but do you what else I think is murder? Eating meat. Should I put that into law? Hell no.|`|YupMCYHlaa	This whole issue has gotten to be more about politics than religion.    First of all, most people, believers or atheists, are not 100% pro choice or pro life.  Religious leaders, politicians, and the media like to talk about this as a fence, with everyone on either one side or the other.  But most people are somewhere in the middle.  For instance, I support choice, but I don't think late-term abortions should be performed without a good reason, and it bothers me to think about a twelve-year-old girl getting an abortion without her parents even knowing.    Secondly, in order to be truly pro-life, you have to have some understanding of when life begins.  This used to be a legitimate question.  The idea that life begins when the sperm hits the egg is not Biblical, it is not technical, it is POLITICAL.  For many years, it was only Catholics who believed this, but of course Catholics don't believe in birth control either.  Protestant Christians were brought into the pro-life movement relatively recently, more for political reasons than having to do with faith.  The idea that life begins at conception was designed to drive a stake into the ground that Christians could rally around.    In fact, more than half of all fertilized eggs never implant on the uterine wall, never develop. They flush out of the woman's body with her next period, usually before she ever realized she was 'pregnant'.  If you really believe all these eggs have souls and are human beings, do you think God would kill half of them?    The thing is, if life doesn't begin there, where does it begin?  You could never be sure.  So there wouldn't be any pro-life movement at all if not for that one standard, even though it is artificial and arbitrary.  People believe it as a tenet of their religion.  People who aren't religious don't have as much reason to believe it.|`|gbBJ2q1Qaa	I am pro-choice.    Not anti-choice.  (Pro-life is a lie)    You make it seem that if you're pro-choice, you're pro-abortion, which is wrong.|`|ViZH5twNaa	I don't like abortion, but I don't feel the need to force every thing I like and dislike on everyone else like a certain religious group does. It is for the woman to decide, not me, not you, not even the majority of America; THE WOMAN. What pro-lifers are suggesting is called mob rule. The close minded majority can by just as tyrannical as any single ruler.|`|N8Im0nQLaa	I am pro-CHOICE, but I am NOT pro-abortion.  I personally would never have an abortion but I do not feel that the government should be able to dictate something that is between a woman and her god/goddess.|`|3yNh5jO8aa	It seems that you are only getting half answers on here. Good question!|`|KgYIYXEtaa	I don't want to name names but I have seen quite a few atheists round here stating 'pro-life' views. In real life, I used to date someone who was an atheist and anti-abortion.    It's a fallacy that only religious people are anti-abortion, no doubt stemming from the fact that the lunatics - the marchers and clinic-blockers - are almost always organized via a church group.|`|KjF0p72naa	Pro life vs Pro "choice" is often based on what type of "restrictions" people want on their lives and the "choices" they want to have access to in their daily lives.  Many people who do not rely on the Bible as the ultimate autority on matters such as abortion or things Christians see as immoral simply are not Christians for reasons such as wanting their way all the time. Selfishness is at the root of most immoral thinking and it's nothing to point a finger at...it's just one group of people living for themselves vs another group of people living for Christ. (And many who claim to love Christ still side with those who deny his very existance on the issue of abortion. We just can't judge anyone by their being Pro life or Pro "choice". You just have to stand for what you know is right-not killing the unborn-and pray for those who don't see it as what it is-murder.)|`|zkETPA8waa	There are pro-life atheists, just the same as there are pro-choice Christians. There's a whole spectrum across all belief systems.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	That is because extremism is a christian trait due to lack of balance in their thinking!!|`|ulwXFrrJaa	There are some.      Not many.

The loudest and least willing to compromise tend to be religious from what I have seen.|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	Sorry, not me.  Women deserve to decide what happens to their own bodies.|`|0hdo4WORaa	We are all pro-life, we just aren't anti-choice|`|jRcdbna5aa	Pro-life meaning, "I'm against the idea of abortion," or pro-life meaning, "No one should be permitted to have abortions for any reason?"    If the first, then, yes.  I personally don't like the idea of it.  I'd rather see there be a lot better education about and availability of birth control, for teenagers on up.  I think that this will cut down on abortions considerably.    However, abortion still needs to be available for those women who need it (such as health or rape).  Also, as always, a woman needs to be allowed to have control over her own body.|`|M3sVQm2Maa	Sure there are, it depends on the individual.  I don't happen to be one of them, though.|`|618d6176d8533769ef7d61342adb7d16aa	the same people that are pro life are the same morons that are against stem cell research.....stem cell research has the potential to cure disease, and as of last week in helped lab rats walk again after spinal cord injury....against this research  for the belief that an embryo is a living baby...morons..........and its not like  abortion is all the way legal...you can only have an abortion during a certain amount of time....christians have no idea how  much nicer the world would be if they would worry about themselves and there own friends and family..and there own relationship with there god...if you fear going to a "hell" then make sure you don't go....but keep out of everyone Else's business.......live your own life not everyone Else's........if your god  is so powerful..and he really doesn't wont abortions to happen..then he should do something about it...................that's what i thought|`|yvDzvIbBaa	im pro life, but im also pro choice.    i think abortion should be regulated much stricter. using it as a form of contraception should come with a jail sentence.    you should be able to get an abortion if you are raped, or you don't have the money to support it.    you can mention adoption, but we have loads of unadapted kids already.    if its life is going to be that ****, cause you happen to be some crack wh*re and you make 10$ a week, then get rid of it.    if your some rich 15 year old girl that is scared, tough sh*t. youre having a kid or going to jail or adopitng one or something.|`|0312ec6bd9788b0c6bf89b026c84d0c6aa	I do know several Atheists who are against abortion myself but as they see themselves as good humanists they state that they would not condemn the woman`s choice to abort their babies, which seems so hypocritical to me, and a clear case of sitting on the moral fence and down-right cowardly, it is not a woman`s choice to be able to murder an innocent life and there is no justification either,these innocent lives are not war,they are not the enemy and still they are treated like the Nazi`s treated the Jews during the holocaust,as useless sub-humans.  I think that some future generation will look back on our times and say this about the millions of murdered babies,`How could they have allowed this to happen` just as we now look back on the Nazi`s and the holocaust and say `How could the world have allowed that to happen`  The modern silent holocaust of abortion in terms of numbers simply dwarves what the Nazi`s did many times over, the wombs of mothers who have had an abortion simply to get rid of their unborn babies in the past 30yrs,those same wombs that should have been the safest place on earth can only be compared to the death camps of Austwitz and Belsen, deadly ovens of infanticide.  The fact too is that even those who have never had an abortion give silent affirmation to it whenever they vote in Politicians like Barack Obama who are pro-abortion, Politicians represent us, we vote them into office and so we carry the can of guilt by association, by putting them there in the first place.  Finally to remain silent for whatever reason be it fear or as the saying goes,`Anything for a quiet life` does not exempt us from sharing this guilt too, to remain silent in the face of the greatest massacre the world has ever known is in itself criminal, and we will one day have to pay the price of our silence.  God bless.|`|3nw2Pwu8aa	Wow, so many people that are in favour of legalised murder. Disgusting. You all talk about the womans choice, the womans body, just so you can conveniently forget the one PERSON it really affects....the HUMAN BABY!!! You know society is going down the toilet when people celebrate in the streets when they get the right to kill the most innocent, the most defensless ones....the ones that we used to fight tooth and nail to protect, our babies. Now we just kill them because they're not "convenient" to our lives, or they "won't have a good life because they've got downsyndrome or some other disability". Why don't all you pro-murder people go out and kill all those that have these disabilities, whether they're 5, 10, 40, whatever age, because surely they can't be having good lives either. People who are in favour of abortions are among the lowest, filthiest people in our society in my opinion. When you are in favour of killing a little child i have absolutely no respect for you what so ever. What's next?? We can kill off a toddler because they got injured in an accident and are brain damaged, surely they can't have a good life....oh and the parents probably won't cope....oh lets leave it up to the mother. Society needs to take a good hard look at itself, we are turning into a self-centered people that will only lead to our demise

Are you so arrogant that you think there is only one way to interpret scripture, i.e. yours?  How Christian is that?  Why don't you read a decent commentary on Corinthians and try to understand the context of these verses?  Why do you assume that what may, arguably, have been good practice for one congregation in Asia Minor 2000 years ago is even remotely relevant to the way we live now?

I do not think that women should be preacher, priest, or leaders in the Church - because Scripture says that they shouldn't.

Be Blessed:-)|`|zZxX5PXBaa	Well, it looks increasingly as if you're just trolling.    There is no contradiction. You just choose to force an interpretation on these particular verses which is at odds with other passages in Scripture that are plain. Most Christians follow the traditional christian practice of using the plain to shed light on the uncertain. You are obsessed with these verses for reasons that clearly have nothing to do with the bible itself, but which come from some extra-biblical source. None of the rest of us know what that source is, or why you are so obsessed with one tiny piece of the bible, when the bible itself repeatedly emphasises the authority of all of it, the whole counsel of God.    If anyone's resisting the word of God, you are.    Or you could just be a troll.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	I agree with lady of liberty.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Sometimes they don't even do that.  Typically, they pick out these verses and say, "Oh, those rules were only meant for one church in Corinth."

As for catholics, especially priests, have they not read 2Cor 5:19,  where it specifically notes reconciling the world does not impute sin to them. So what sin are they law imputing for other people to confess? Maybe they should read Romans 2:1 to note such condemnation of others is also self-condemning with consequences.

If you cant help it them just follow your heart only you can do what you think is best in for your life.

k03dYskYaa	Genesis Chapter 1  These are not 24 hour days.  Was all physical creation accomplished in just six days sometime within the past 6,000 to 10,000 years?    The facts disagree with such a conclusion: (1)?Light from the Andromeda nebula can be seen on a clear night in the northern hemisphere. It takes about 2,000,000 years for that light to reach the earth, indicating that the universe must be at least millions of years old. (2)?End products of radioactive decay in rocks in the earth testify that some rock formations have been undisturbed for billions of years.    Genesis 1:3-31 is not discussing the original creation of matter or of the heavenly bodies. It describes the preparation of the already existing earth for human habitation. This included creation of the basic kinds of vegetation, marine life, flying creatures, land animals, and the first human pair. All of this is said to have been done within a period of six days. However, the Hebrew word translated day has a variety of meanings, including a long time; the time covering an extraordinary event. (Old Testament Word Studies, Grand Rapids, Mich.; 1978, W. Wilson, p. 109) The term used allows for the thought that each day could have been thousands of years in length.|`|29X6EEsKaa	They aren't mutually exclusive, i.e. You can believe in both.

The present is the illusory sphere one sees in the spinning coin.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Why "or?"  God could well have used a Big Bang to start the universe, and guided its development from that point.  And there is plenty of evidence of an intelligent Creator in the world of living things.    For instance, a bird called the Blackpoll Warbler has been tracked flying from Alaska to New England and then out over the Atlantic, catching the Jet Stream back to South America, then flying back all the way to Alaska every year.    If somebody asked US to construct a flying machine that can fly from Alaska to New England to South America and back unaided, could we? But suppose they also asked us to make it weigh less than one ounce. Could we? And no one may build it--it must build itself, because that is what the Blackpoll Warbler does in its egg, doesn't it? Feathers, dual TV cameras, flight computer and all. From a speck in an egg. Would we even try? Could the US government? The entire University system, with an impressive array of bright students, knowledgeable professors and able administrators? All those advanced human brains combined, connected together by the Internet? No? So how much sense does it make to say that blind, unthinking Chance just "accidentally" did so through blind, unthinking evolution?     My young school friend pointed out that since we have about 100 trillion cells in our body and each has about 5 feet of DNA, that makes about 100 trillion times 5 feet, or 100 billion times 5000 feet (about a mile), or 100 billion miles of perfect code that is required to make us a body that works. Since the characters (the "letters") that that code is "printed" in are actually the size of molecules, that makes a lot of "typing" to give us a body. Could we type that much without making a mistake, since any mistake would cause a genetic weakness or birth defect? Could blind chance?     Another thing. Ever tried to swat a fly? Not necessarily easy, right? Know why? It has to do with the fly's navigational system. It has a single vibrating rod in its abdomen, and as it changes direction in flight, it senses the changes in the vibrations of that rod and is able to dodge you, fly and land upside down and backwards. What would the Air Force pay to have flying and navigational systems that good?    How did the fly manage to evolve such a system? Even if it evolved the vibrating rod, what good would it be without the nerves to send the signals from the rod to the brain? And the section of the brain to interpret the signals? And the correct instructions to interpret them? And the correct instructions to the part of the brain that controlled the wings as to what to DO about those signals? All AT THE SAME TIME. Wouldn't that be a remarkable coincidence? I ask people, "Could YOU sit down, right now, and write the code for such a set of instructions? And if your ten billion well trained and coordinated neurons put together can't do it with a computer, is it really reasonable to think that flies did it by themselves?"    The fly has a complete navigational system that is self-constructing (in its egg), self-reproducing, self-programming, self-correcting, that can fly upside down and backwards, avoiding dangers and locating and recognizing fuel (food), that requires even MORE entire, completely developed systems that even large groups of highly educated humans cannot or are only now beginning to be able to copy (and only by intelligent design), all microminiaturized into a space smaller than the head of a pin, with the code for it in characters that are the size of molecules (I wonder how many characters per inch that works out to? Pretty hi-tech data storage).     So I ask people, "In your experience, how many complete flying and navigational systems do you know of that have happened completely by accident, with no intelligent thought or design?" "Did you ever read the story of all the thought and work needed to design and build a flying machine, as told by the Wright brothers themselves? So how scientific is it to say that it just happened by blind accidents in the case of the lowly, incredibly complex fly?"    All of the animal and plant world is full of examples like these. Your body is, too. Johns Hopkins University made the newspapers by making one enzyme. It must have been pretty hard to do. It was no accident. But your liver manufactures over nine hundred enzymes, all necessary for you to live, and no one thinks about putting THAT in the paper, or giving credit for that accomplishment to the One who deserves it. "Could have happened completely by accident" (which is what evolution equates to, isn't it?) But if it could happen so easily, simply by accidents of evolution, then why put the university in the news because it was able to produce ONE?    This isn't defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, and unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old earth, by very fallible people supposedly in God's name...

The fact is "salvation" is built into the Soul, since the Soul is an aspect of God, and thus an Absolute and cannot be harmed in any way... but that is Reality, and life as we know and experience it is an illusion.    If one only wants to spend some time in some heaven, then a moral life will accomplish this for one.  But the stay in such a heaven is only temporary, and one must reincarnate again in another life, and so on until one determines that one is tired of the merry-go-round of birth and death.    To achieve self-realization is the first step toward exiting this cycle, and it leads to God-realization if one follows a most rigorous path that is little known.  This path is explained in the book listed.    Peace|`|IYBTmH26aa	You're close.  God does, in fact, ask for people to follow His commandments, the same commandments in the Torah as they are in the Bible.     Just about everyone on the face of the Earth has disobeyed this very thing.    What the Atheists have done that Christians failed to do is that they question everything.  In the Bible, God says to "Prove all Things and Hold Fast to Which is Good."      God expects us to study and follow those things that are Good and truthful.  This means we are expected to test the Bible, but you do not test God and His patience.  We do not blindly follow assumptions.    What the Christians have done but the Atheists fail to do is that they believe in the one true Living God.  God also states the Bible that "A fool says there is no God."  That would make people who declare that God does not exist fools.    Where many Christians seem to flub up on, but the Muslims and the Jews get right is that they follow God's Laws and commandments.  No pork, no shellfish, they make proper reparations for damages done, they are good with their money, etc.  They don't typically worship pagan holidays such as Easter, Christmas, etc.  However, neither of them accept the idea Jesus Christ is bringing a coming  Kingdom, and to be apart of the Kingdom we need to go through Him (Jesus Christ).  Follow His example and believe He is the Messiah who died on the cross for our sins. Jews also have kept the correct day of the Sabbath, as well as the Church of God and Seventh Day Adventists.  This is why the Jews (Judah) have been able to maintain their identity and the other lost tribes of Israel have not.     As you can see, there are truths that each of our God of Abrahamic-based faiths have accepted but not all together. That still is not enough in God's eyes to make it into the Kingdom.    However, God has kept a long-standing covenant with Israel (all of Israel, not just the Jews).  We were set apart to be a model nation for the entire world, but we didn't live up to the standard so we are going to get our punishment first.  The rest of the world will get their punishment second.     When Christ sets up his throne in Jerusalem and rules the entire Earth according to the laws of God, then we finally have peace.  Everyone will be on the same sheet of paper.  All who have ever been conceived since the days of Adam and Eve will be resurrected at different intervals during Christ's millenial peace.  That will allow everyone to get it right without the influence of the Devil.|`|J7KSKm54aa	"By George, I think he's got it"|`|UO9x4Curaa	Some people object that worship is degrading and therefore God shouldn't require it. Yet what is worship? Worship is not groveling before God, nor is it performing meaningless rituals. God hates hypocrisy and insincere worship (Hos 6:6, Is 1:11-17). What God does tell us to do is to love him (Mt 22:35-40). Loving God includes praising him, thanking him and obeying him (1 Jn 5:3). If God is perfect, then he deserves praise, and his commands are good commands that should be obeyed. Worshiping God is not degrading to us, but actually benefits us:     Worshiping God fulfills us and makes us happy. We like to see that a person's goodness is acknowledged and rewarded; praising God gives his followers the same satisfaction.     Worshiping God puts us into the proper relationship with him, in the sense that we are acknowledging that he is God and deserves worship, and doing what he wants us to do. (Being completely right with God requires more than worship - see The Four Spiritual Laws.) This allows us to have a closer and more fulfilling relationship with God (see Do people need God? for more on the benefits of knowing God).     By worshiping God, we acknowledge his perfection, which is the first step in learning from him: we realize he's a perfect teacher, and then we are willing for him to teach us and increase our wisdom and morality.     Publicly expressed worship is one way that people find out who God is. When they come to know God, they too will find fulfillment and grow into better people, which benefits not only them but society at large.   Another objection is that it's unreasonable for God to demand that we worship him alone and no one else. Yet this too is for our benefit:     They pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger. But am I the one they are provoking? declares the LORD. Are they not rather harming themselves, to their own shame? (Jer 7:18-19)   If Christianity is true, then the Christian God really is the only God, and praying to another god is praying to someone who doesn't exist. Not only is that counterproductive, it's harmful: the person who does so is ignoring the help and advice that God is willing to give him, and is instead seeking help from a nonexistent deity. At best, he will receive no benefit from the false god, and will have damaged his relationship with the true God (for praying to a false god is really saying to God, "I don't trust you to answer me or help me, so I'm going to seek help from another source," and also, "I don't believe you when you say you're the only God; your words aren't trustworthy"). At worst, praying to a false god allows him to be deceived - for instance, he may fool himself into thinking that the false god has given him permission to do something evil.   On the other hand, if we worship the true God, we receive all the benefits of a relationship with God, including his love, forgiveness and guidance.

J18K52Wtaa	It was a ritual which came from the Scotts & European Celts centuries ago. They celebrated Candlemans Day, it was a day which was half -way between the winter solstice and the vernal equinox.  They believed that the animals which hibernated had supernatural powers over the planting seasons, therefore if an animal which hibernates ( bears--groundhogs, etc.) came out of hibernation too early and saw their own shadow, it was too early and they went back into hibernation for 4-6 weeks, then spring would begin.  Hope that helped.|`|264GS7s7aa	if the groundhog sees it's shadow, there is winter for 6 more weeks.|`|vwMqD014aa	If the groundhog sees it's shadow,it means that spring will arrive early.

Beer doesn't tell you how to have sex.   They don't force Beer on minors who can't think for themselves.   Beer has never caused a major war.   Beer is useful when you're down   Beer has been helping ugly people get laid for ages   If you've devoted your life to Beer, there are groups to help you stop.   When you have Beer, you don't knock on people's doors trying to give it away.   You don't have to wait 2000+ years for a second Beer.   Nobody's ever been burned at the stake, hanged, or tortured for his brand of Beer.   There are laws saying Beer labels can't lie to you.   You can prove you have a Beer.   Beer is useful: You can drink it.   A beer, drunk properly, is a social winner.   You can switch your brand of beer whenever you want without losing beer-drinking friends.   Beer helps you enjoy life, religion reminds you how **** people are.   Beer is a social lubricant, religion is a social inhabitant   Beer was instrumental in the formation of the American constitution.

bMJ0AYI1aa	first of all, there are lots of different kinds of hinduism.    but in general, they believe in many gods, some of whom are very powerful, some of whom are smaller in scope. it's not the ONE god like you believe, it's a bunch of little gods that do specific thing. in general, each hindu family has a particular god they prefer (not all hindus worship all the gods).   they worship by presenting offerings. they have an altar with a sculpture or picture of the god or goddess, and they put candy, flowers, incense, pocket change, and other nice items on the altar, as an offering to the god or goddess. they give praise to the god or goddess, and they can ask for specific things. some gods or goddesses help with specific things, kinda like saints. so just like you might pray to one saint for financial success, another saint for good health, etc, hindus will pray to different gods or goddesses for different occasions like holidays, asking for health, praying at the start of a journey, etc. You can do this yourself at a temple, or at your home altar, or you can visit a temple and a hindu priest can say prayers for you.    each god or goddess has a whole story. an animal they like to use as a vehicle (riding on the back of an eagle or whatever), each one has a weapon, something else they're holding, and a god or goddess as husband or wife. some of the gods and goddesses have families, for example the elephant headed god ganesh (who is a human with an elephant head) is the son of shiva and parvati.    the main gods are these:  brahma, who is the highest god, but very few people worship him directly. there is only one brahma temple in india, in the town of pushkar (been there).  shiva, who is the destroyer, but of course for anything new to come about something must be destroyed, so he's also the creator.  and vishnu, who is the preserver. vishnu appears as himself, and he also appears as one of several incarnations. the famous god krishna is an incarnation of vishnu.  those are the big 3. shiva has a wife (parvati) and son (ganesh). vishnu has a wife.     some gods or goddesses are more popular than others due to their personalities.   krishna is a very popular god for many reasons. he's young, he grew up a poor cowherder. (cows are holy in india because of krishna). krishna is a ladies man, with many girlfriends called gopis and a favorite girlfriend named radha. he's also a musician, which makes him a popular god.    hindus believe in reincarnation and karma. karma usually means "what comes around goes around" or "you reap what you sow", but the idea of good karma is a myth. all karma is attachment to actions and keeps you rooted in the physical world. the point is to do good, but not be attached to the outcome, thus there is no karma. all attachments are worked out through reincarnation, where you come back to balance out your fate or to learn more lessons. when you are free of attachments, you do not need to come back for more lifetimes, you are liberated and enter "heaven".     most hindus are also vegetarian, which comes from a respect for cows because of krishna. there are also social reasons for the development of vegetarianism in india. it's much more efficient, so india can feed itself better as vegetarians. if they ate meat there would be starvation there. it takes much more water, feed and other resources to raise meat than it does to raise vegetables and beans.    i could go on forever. it's very very different than catholicism, but when you get down to the way individual people pray, there are similarities.|`|9Q6CkSMzaa	Umm, okay, I'm not Hindu, but I've studied it before. Let me see if I can help you out here. This may not be a modern description of Hinduism, but this is how it was originally taught and practiced.    Hindu's are monotheistic, believing in one God, but they also believe in different aspects of that one God.   The fact is, they were polytheistic (believing in many gods), but became monotheistic. "The Truth is 1, but many names/aspects"    They believe(d) that women should be respected and honored at all times, because when they are honored the gods rejoice.  This is probably due to the fact that women are typically the ones giving birth, bringing life into the world. So, why wouldn't we honor them? They create life.    Hindu's also believe in reincarnation, no heaven or hell. How you are reborn in the "next life" is based on you Karma (& Dharma, but we don't need to get into that). Karma is the impact of your previous deeds, usually in former lives, on one's current circumstance.    Being reborn is NOT good. You want to reach Moksha. Moksha is basically the ending of the cycle of rebirth, and is typically the ultimate goal in life for Hindu's.     Moksha is achieved through basically being good. Once you are "good", and reach Moksha, you are "one with God".     Umm, that's the jist of it I think. All I can think of right now. Hinduism was the world's first organized religion, going all the way back to 1500 (B.C.E., or B.C.). Their doctrine is based on the principles of harmony, self-dicipline, and spiritual peace.    Hope that helps. lol|`|RiycmPZbaa	Reincarnation is one.|`|ZG2eVULoaa	Good luck !    90% of hindus don't understand their own religion enough to explain it themselves.|`|3180e2b368500ca94cbac1a023253d3caa	Idol worship|`|Y6odIQgJaa	One of their foundations is the belief in reincarnation.    That really doesn't require much explanation.|`|AA12203324	Essentially, a Hindu believes that the world is an illusion and that there is only a universal consciousness ("Brahman") that is experimenting by disguising itself as the world ("Samsara").  Individual consciousness is called "Atman", but it is really "Brahman" unrecognized.  Life is about becoming aware of one's "Brahman" nature, achieving release ("Moksha") from the Samasara and realizing one's true nature.  This is difficult and usually takes many lives to accomplish.    There are many other beliefs derived from these basic ideas, and many ways of practicing the Hindu faith.  Some practice devotion to the large number of allegorical Hindu "gods" to move their minds beyond the ordinary and themselves.  Others use physical discipline to free their minds from slavery to bodily needs.  Still others meditate, practicing "detachment", which is a way of disassociating oneself from one's physical and emotional feelings.  These different ways are referred to as "yogas". although Westerners are most familiar with the physical kind.    The reincarnation Hindus believe in is extensive, not limited to human beings.  That is why Hindus are vegetarians and generally non-violent, so as to avoid harming a fellow creature who has farther to go on their spiritual journey.    Many Hindus also believe in a "caste" system, assuming that various roles in society can be ranked in terms of spiritual progress.  One is born into a caste and cannot change castes during a single life.  At the top are the "brahmins", who are a priestly caste.  Below them are the noble/military and merchant classes, then the laborer/artisan caste, and finally those with no caste, the "untouchables".  People born into higher castes have an easier life so it is assumed they have fewer spiritual lessons to learn, but some see the caste system as a way of preventing social progress.    One other crucial belief is karma, which is the belief that deeds of compassion or of selfishness have an effect on your future spiritual progress, so it is always desireable to do good deeds in order to shorten the cycle of reincarnation and achieve the enlightenment of Moksha.    Hinduism is a very inclusive faith, considering how diverse its practices are, and different Hindu communities and individuals have very different practices.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Hinduism has much in common with Christianity. While most people say "I'll believe it when I see it" a Hindu says "I'll see it when I believe it". Hindus believe that consciousness gives substance to the physical world. They believe that thought literally creates the universe. Jesus could have been a Hindu when he taught that faith as small as a mustard seed can move a mountain.|`|ad6XOMliaa	When I researched it a few years ago. I was informed that it was technically  not a religion. It was a philosophy of "Harmony is harmony; disharmony is the prime (only) sin against our neighbors. If you can stand this metaphor, I will humbly offer it to you.  1. Don't tug on Superman's cape, 2. don't pull the mask off the Lone Ranger, and 3. don't walk on other people's lawns.  --- in short live and let live; a hindu never condemns anyone's religion. That is why it was a welcome place for Siddhartha Buddha.-- so a lot of people identify Hinduism with reincarnation.

Eating disorders often start at your age - it really isn't a path you want to follow toward young adulthood.|`|4NV4bew9aa	See a counsellor before you get worse!

X1jupF0paa	You say you don't believe in God, but you do. God is the energy you are a part of, how else could it have come about.|`|u8IUPlECaa	Yes, but your attitude towards religion is very small-minded. Religions are not all one and the same.  Beliefs vary widely. For example, Buddhists believe that we are in a cycle of rebirth that will end when we reach enlightenment, and that all living beings have the potential to reach enlightenment. They accept suffering as the natural state of the world that we can be freed from by cultivating love and compassion. Gnostic Christians and Hindus believe something similar, I think. And Christians and Jews believe that God has given us free will, and that non-death/disease related suffering is the result of humans succumbing to evil (ie starting wars, committing murder, etc). Death is a natural part of life, and we do not know why. So if God exists, he would not allow us to endure unwarranted pain without justice and mercy in the afterlife. I do not know enough about Islam to write about it, but I do know that violent fundamentalists exist within the otherwise very peaceful faith. There are hateful fundamentalist sects among all of the major religions, of course.    The beliefs vary within groups, too. Buddhism is far less dogmatic, for instance, than evangelical Christianity. But among Buddhists there are those who believe that there is no ultimate higher being, and there are those that do.. just as among Christians, there are those who believe that the Bible should be taken literally word for word, and those who believe that Bible was an allegory.. And it is rare that two Reform Jews hold more than a few common beliefs.  What I'm saying is, there are many shades of gray, and if you open your mind to it a bit, whether or not you believe them to be true, it is best to at least try to understand how complex it is before you dismiss it completely.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	atheist doesn't believe in god; just doesn't really think there is one, or doubts that there is;  that's all    an atheist doesn't necessarily say THERE IS NO GOD|`|ZcVB2UG6aa	No, actually, that's not proof at all.  That's your opinion.  As far as God "causing war, corruption, disease, and hatred....".

Maybe those are closer to your world view...|`|NWH4pySHaa	That's everyone's question: how can a perfect person cause war, etc.  Well God gave us the right of choice meaning that we have the choice ourselves to cause war, etc. God isn't someone standing up there with his magic wand pointing it at people going "Oh, country x is being mean to country y! away with ye country x!" its not like that-its our own conscience and perspective of right and wrong that makes these things happen-not God.     But you might be an atheist, but atheist believe that after death there is nothing. So, IDK. Don't go changing your myspace profile just yet...|`|QlB3VXWraa	A person who does not believe in a god or gods is an atheist.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I doubt you are completely atheist.  The evil you cited is the result of human free will.  God doesn't do it - we do.    If you want a good reason to believe in God and the goodness of religion, look at the hospitals, schools and universities started by the Roman Catholic Church.  Not good enough?  How about the poor people we feed and clothe around the world?  We Catholics get our inspiration to do this from God, in the person of His son, Jesus Christ.       The first people who were Christians knew Jesus before and after He was crucified.  Many of them were killed for telling what they knew - that Jesus was the Son of God, which means He is God.   Those first believers wrote down what they knew, and many of them died for their beliefs rather than deny it was all True. They would not have done that unless they genuinely believed it all and had good reason for their beliefs.    I think the painful sacrifices of the first Christians are substantial evidence that Christianity is The Truth.   Christianity is too difficult for people to have invented it as a lie just to control others.   Christianity is The Truth,  and the difficulty of being a good Christian is part of the evidence that Christianity is True.      Peace be with you.|`|j0oU4V3baa	Syeah, whatever.|`|oeeT4Zlqaa	God didn't cause those things, we did. Life isn't going to be rainbows and sunshine all the time.

Your help at their house is invaluable! Take care of pets, water plants, fetch the mail and paper, cleaning and laundry are always appreciated! Make sure she comes home to a clean house! If you cook - make a meal or two for the family - even if it's frozen lasagna. But watch out.. she will want you to marry her son!!|`|f3n2zXG2aa	..........

There are a lot of promiscuous "closet" homosexuals who hook up with random men for sex only. I don't think that is what you are looking for and it is very dangerous because those men have the highest rate of HIV+ and don't get tested because they have families and are not "out". You should try going to social functions where there are likeminded gay men looking for other men to date. This can be art functions in the community or on campuses, gay/straight alliances are also good starting points I think. Just please stay away from the net when looking to meet sexual partners.

nhGIZE71aa	We can pray at any time, although there are certain times that have become customary for various purposes and occasions.  For example, some will pray at 4am.  Some will pray at dawn, noon and dusk.  It really depends on the particular tradition a person follows, and on the person's individual whim.  There is no fixed rule for this.  In fact the ultimate goal is to reach a state where every moment is a continuous meditation on the ultimate reality.
jRcdbna5aa	As you said, no one really knows.  Even atheists don't really know.  The reason?  No one has ever come back that to tell us.  At least, no one we can verify.    By the way, CJ, instant heaven and hell is not true.  According to the Bible, we will stay in the ground until Judgment Day, and *then* be assigned our reward/punishment.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Only "God" knows.|`|cLgghhuXaa	Your physical body decays...|`|GqNZInUbaa	...........and taxes !|`|4DEVVRlIaa	Depends on your religion or personal belief's.    For the native americans, depending on what tribe you are from, you go by boat to a village and in that village you see people you have know while you were alive. Whether it be family or friends. There you would possibly resume the life you once had minus all the torture so to speak. Now if you did bad, I think you pretty much go nowhere. Its been awhile since I last read one of my books on the subject.    As for the religious, you have the heaven or hell. Or you are stuck on earth as a wandering spirit.    The only real way to know is to simply die. Unfortunately, you can't come back and tell everyone what's there. Sad, isn't it.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	At the death of our bodies, the spirit separates from the body and goes to God's presence for a preliminary sorting into Paradise or Prison.  Those that have lived basically good lives go to Paradise where they can rest and continue to learn about Christ and His redemption.  Those that were basically evil will go to Prison where they can begin the repentance process for their sins.  They will also learn about Christ and His redemption.  When the spirits in Paradise have completed their preparations, they will again labor for Christ in teaching the other spirits and preparing for eternity.  That includes going to the spirits in Prison to teach them the gospel.  The spirits in Prison must wait longer for their resurrection until after all the righteous have been resurrected.  Then upon resurrection the spirits of both areas will be given their eternal reward based upon their faith and works.  Those that faithfully followed Christ will go to the Celestial Kingdom, or the kingdom of the sun.  Those that were good people but were not faithful to Christ will go to the Terrestrial Kingdom or the kingdom of the moon.  Those that were wicked will then go to the Telestial Kingdom or the kingdom of the stars.  Finally, those that were truly evil, the Sons of Perdition, or sons of Satan, will go to outer darkness where there is no glory.  Only a handful of spirit will deserve that category.  Rest assured that all will be resurrected.  All will acknowledge Christ as the Savior and nearly all will receive a degree of glory.  It behooves us to prepare now, while in mortality, to become as much like Christ as we can for those that do will have so much the advantage in the life to come.|`|0ac02757252bf3673e5594f1927600faaa	we go to the spirit world and teach those spirits who have not heard of Jesus yet, while we wait for the final judgment.

So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now! :)     Only faith alone in Jesus saves! Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|ni6SCUm9aa	That would depend.|`|KB007gFYaa	I ADVISED YOU TO SEE THIS VIDEO SEE IT ALLL. it might change your life. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJq5819hV...    in the religion of islam there is only one god "ALLAH".|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	funeral|`|AA11703455	All humans return to the ground, as God said to Adam, "from dust you came, to dust you return". Is that the end? By no way.    Martha, the sister of Lazarus, told Jesus that she expected that he would be resurrected in the last days. Jesus pointed out that he was that future source of resurrection. To support that he was going have that authority, he then brought back her brother to life.     Later in Acts, Paul speaks of his confidence in the resurrection of both the "righteous and unrighteous".     Then in Revelation Chapter 20, the vision shows all the dead, from great to small, coming to life, escaping Hades (or Hell if that is how your translation reads), all the dead that is in the seas too.     The future that awaits the dead? Chapter 21 of Revelation. A world without death, or pain. A place of peace between God and men, and between men. Chapter 22 then shows that all will be healed, both physically and spiritually.|`|LUGWyWrLaa	Going by all I can find in the bible about death.  We go into a deep state of non-consciousness. Void of time or space.  It is as it was before we were born.  When Jesus comes back the second time, he will raise the dead back up and the saved on earth will all meet him in the air.  We will go with him to the places he has prepared for us and promised us if we believe in Him.  The time between when we die and that time will seem instant as we were in a state where time did not exist.  So for us.we go instantly to heaven.  Those non-believers will remain on earth to live out the tribulation.  Or not.  But right now right here in this time that I am in, none of my saved relatives are in heaven yet.  We will all go at the same time.  The saved that is.  I really enjoyed the music on the youtube website but I really didn't get the point other than they believe there is only one God.|`|NOTc1b9saa	Dear friend, you have lived before and died before, MANY times and it doesnt seem to have affected too badly does it?!    You are a Spiritual Being temporarily within a physical overcoat while you journey through this life, and each night when you go to bed and relax, Spiritual YOU leaves your body and you are then said to be asleep and, because YOU are not there you cannot respond until your Spiritual body returns in the morning and you awaken..When we die, it is the same situation except you dont bother to return in the morning!    God IS Love, so that is the key to life, and as we live our lives, to the degree that we live with love for others and ourselves, we create a personal frequency or vibration, which when we die, means we gravitate quite naturally to that level in the World Of Spirit or Heaven(from which we come and to which we ALL and always return,) which equates to that level of Love/Light that we have lived our lives with..    The world of Spirit is the next level of reality to physicality, and has numerous levels, from the very lowest, which could be described as *hell like* (but without fire!) to the highest and beyond, each progressively more beautiful and blissful..    There is no separate God judging us because LOVE does not judge, but when we are ready, and after we have met with our loved ones who went on before, we are shown a kind of *Life video* reflecting the major happenings in our life, and having reached the point of total self honesty, like in the story of Scrooge, most of us have deep regret as we are shown the effect of our life actions or lack of, on the lives of others and for most of us, many tears are shed..But with Angelic counselling and guidance, we eventually get through that and, perhaps, determine that NEXT time we will do better!    The opposite of Love is fear, and those religions who teach fear are pushing people in the opposite way to the simple truth, that God IS Unconditional Love, and Love simply Loves, CANNOT and does not judge or threaten or condemn to eternal punishment..Would any *parent* do that to his/her own Child?..So how could God, our Heavenly Parent, POSSIBLY act in that way?..We have been given a brain and discernment for us to use..    That which is Loving and positive comes from God, but that which is fearful or judgemental or condemning comes from MAN..God is within each one of us!..*Be still and KNOW*...
rV1uAtt3aa	The Bible is actually a collection of many earlier "works" that have been edited together by religious leaders into what is thought to be a form that correctly conveys the word of God.    There are essentially two books to the Bible.  The first book is called the Old Testament, and it contains works that date back many thousands of years and may, in turn, have been inspired by works from even older religions.  Up until about 5,000 years ago, the works were only passed on in oral tradition (as writing had not yet spread to the Middle Eastern tribes who worshiped God.)    The New Testament is a more recent work (stemming from 1000-2000 years ago) and detail the life and teachings of Jesus.  The books in the New Testament were all written after his death, and are a sub set of many "gospels" supposedly written by Jesus's apostles or their spiritual descendants.    Hope that helps.|`|WvzS59FKaa	In the Hsitory of the Bible    There were hundreds of books written but St. Augustine formed a group of Catholic scholars, priests, Christian monks to pray, study and discern on what books should be included in the Bible.  This then were studied again by Bishops and discerned and approved by the Seat of Peter the Pope in Rome.      During the time, only a few people had the copy of the Bible because there were no copier yet, these were transferred by Catholic monks and priests which was given great care and was written with great caution.     A protestant named Luther, out of his protest and disobedience to the traditions of the Catholic church translated the Bible from the original Greek or Latin,which was originally compiled by the Catholic church removed some books and verses from the compiled Bible of the Catholic Church.

It is divided in two sections: Old Testament, the first 39 books; and the New Testament, covering the remaining 27 books.

The Bible is meant to describe God's plan of salvation for man through Jesus Christ. It is NOT meant to be a history or science book. Yet if science or history is addressed it is accurate.  The Bible is further divided into History, poetic, Prophetic, Gospels, and epistles.|`|jRcdbna5aa	A lot of different people wrote the various parts of the Bible.

Interestingly, due solely to its religious nature, it has not been considered authoritative in the past.  The more we learn about the events described in the bible from things like archaeology and history, the more well-accepted as an authoritative source it becomes.  Many scholars use biblical descriptions, for example, to locate ruins of archaeological significance or to create models of historic edifices that no longer exist.      4) Did many people write it- like disciples or something or.

Mr. mysterious hmm...|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	The bible is merely the name given to the book which is a compilation of texts written by many men and believed to be inspired by God (as in he kept them from making religious doctrinal errors) over thousands of years.     The bible did not always exist.  It was created after careful consideration (also believed to have been inspired by God) by theologians and Bishops of the Catholic church centered in Rome. This process was not done entirely at once, but took shape over hundreds of years.    There was MUCH debate over which books were divinely inspired and which were not. The EXACT criteria used was never expressly listed, but thru the writings of various Theologians on the topic, we can be fairly certain what criteria, amongst other things, they considered.     As early as 168AD (Christ died around 32AD) we can see lists of "recommended" texts circulating amongst Christian groups.  Most of these lists contained a fair number of the books which made up the NT we have today.  By 250AD, the books of recommended reading started to get compiled into Codex's (primitive bound books like we have today)    By 306AD the issue had received enough debate that the Council of Hippo was convened.    It became apparent to the Catholic church that people around the world were beginning to believe in all sorts of variations of belief because of different "scriptures" they were reading. Heretics and False Priests were inventing their own scriptures.  It was extremely hard for an un-educated average person to know WHAT to believe.  Therefore the need to create an OFFICIAL set of scripture which could be used to teach people was necessary.    In 397AD, the Council of Carthage finally, once and for all, decided on the official canon of the bible. They essentially closed off the bible to further debate.  They created the NT we have today.  They based the Old Testament on the Greek Septuagint, since it was the most widely read and most likely the version which the Apostles themselves used to teach others.   The Septuagint is the greek translation of the Jewish (Hebrew) Tanakh    The bible was STILL in Greek at this time..since Greek was the language of "business" much like English is today.    Since then, the bible has been translated into OTHER languages, like english, German, French, Spanish, etc.    Various versions have been released simply as easier to read translations...ALL of them adhere very closely to the original bibles, but simply substitute words that are easier to understand.  Still the central meaning is intact, so they are considered accurate translations and not "New Bibles" unto themselves.   Version like the King James, New International Version,  American Standard, etc. are ALL merely english translations of the bible.     There has been 2 major changes to the Bible since the Catholic church gave it to the world....    Roughly 1200 years after the Bible was sealed off from alterations.. the Protestant Reformers who broke away from the Catholic church thought that using the Septuagint as the basis of the OT was wrong.  THUS, they changed the basis of it from the Septuagint to the Tanakh.  WELL, the Tanakh had ALSO undergone some minor changes to it as well, before the Jewish religion sealed it off from alterations... Therefore the Hebrew Tanakh contained 7 books fewer then the Septuagint.   Lucky for the Protestant Reformers, these 7 books contained some support for Catholic beliefs like Purgatory.   They therefore MOVED the 7 books which they now labeled "apocrypha" (hidden or suspicious) to the BACK of the Bible in the appendix.    They were content with this until the 1800s when they decided to remove the apocrypha COMPLETELY from the back of the bible.   So alteration  1 was moving the 7 books from the OT to the appendix, thus breaking the order of the original canon and  2 was finally finishing what they started and completely removing them from the bible itself.    To this day the Catholic church STILL includes those 7 books since it follows its OWN canon and NOT the one which the Protestants changed, nearly 1200 years later.  _________    What is ironic, is that Protestants USE this modified canon to say that the Catholic belief in Purgatory is "unbiblical" -- When breaking from the Catholic church they lost their DIRECT connection to the apostles and thus they became "BIBLE Based" denominations believing in "sola scriptura' or "bible alone" -- It is ironic that the Protestant Reformation sought to ALTER the 1 source of religious knowledge they believe is pure and unaltered by Man. -- YET their primary attack against Catholics is that they don't follow the bible.  Hypocritical or just Ironic?  _________    SO, it is authoritative -- ONLY as much authority as the Catholic church gives it, since it is the belief that the Catholic church was founded by Jesus' Apostles which gives the Catholic church any authority to make that decision.  The bible is perhaps the Greatest gift it ever gave the world.  The Catholic church bases its beliefs on  God, Sacred Scripture, and Sacred Tradition,  in that order.  So the bible is considered 2nd, only to God himself, in authority to Instruct people on Faith and Morals.    Sacred Tradition comes from the fact that there was approximately 400years before the bible existed, thus there are BOUND to be some things which early christians believed, which are not in the bible itself.|`|b77af9f788ecbbd1984a5e2166b0d0ceaa	The Bible is God's instructions to help us to live the best life in this trouble world.  God inspired 40 men from different backgrounds to write down His thoughts; when everyone applies His teachings, everyone is able to live his/her life peacefully among each other.  It took about 1600 years to finish the whole 66 little books put together as one complete book, the Bible.  Some people viewed God's Word, the Bible as too restrictive.    So is the Bible restrictive? The answer is yesfor the benefit of all of us. But is the Bible too restrictive? The answer is no. Unlimited freedom leads only to difficulties. The Bibles standards are balanced, and they promote our well-being and happiness. Markus says: Time has proved the wisdom of applying Gods Word in life. Although in many ways my life is different from that of people in general, I dont think for a moment that I have missed out on anything worthwhile in life.    When you begin to experience the blessings of living by Bible standards, your appreciation for Gods Word will increase. This will lead to an even greater blessingyou will come to love its divine Source, Jehovah God. This is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments; and yet his commandments are not burdensome.1?John 5:3.    Jehovah is both our Creator and our heavenly Father. He knows what is best for us. Rather than restrict us, he gives us loving direction for our good. In poetic language Jehovah urges us: O?if only you would actually pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river, and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.Isaiah 48:18.

Sex can also be enjoyed with a small penis, there's alot more to it then penetration.    But by far a 'neo-penis' (Female to Male) is almost always looking different while a 'neo-vagina' (Male to Female) with a good doctor can be mistaken for a natural vagina.    I hope this is of any help.

Your question suggests that you are selfish and only worried about yourself.  You're not concerned with him and his feelings.

Therefore, someone else will live through my death.    I was put on this earth to help my fellow sentient beings.     I find The Big Bang Theory the most logical explanation as to the origins of this universe. Although it is a little more in depth than "Goddidit", a Catholic priest was the first one to propose it so that may give you a little comfort.|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	You need to do way instain question.|`|29X6EEsKaa	Yes, we just die. I like to compare it to a deleted computer file. It doesn't live on (except for a short while in the Recycle Bin), it's simply gone forever.    Science didn't make the universe, it's only a way of measuring forces, some of which made the universe. And billions of people thought the Earth was flat, numbers doesn't equal being right.    EDIT: To answer your edits, it really is impossible to know, since we weren't around. You have to wrap your brain around the concept of "singularity", which is kind of like this: Do you ever think about the 5th dimension of your body? No, you can't comprehend such a thing. We can't comprehend singularity, although we can learn a little by studying quantum particles. But we know this is what the Big Bang started from. But again the theory doesn't concern what caused it, just what happened.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	we were not "put" into this world    science did not create the universe, but science can help us understand it    yes, probably. superstition runs deep because we use to not have any way to explain this|`|q5rTjkjgaa	k if you have not heard this before YOU ARE RETARDED atheism is nothing more than not believing in god not all believe there is nothing after death some believe there is something after life look in the god da*n dictionary ATHEISM= NO GOD THAT IS IT NOTHING ABOUT EVOLUTION LIFE AFTER DEATH JUST NO DEITIES SORRY BUT YOU FAIL HERE|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Basically, yes.

I was 'put here' because my parents wanted a third child, seeing how the second one died.

There's no cosmic/supreme intelligence involved in my existence.    No, "science" did not make the universe.  Science is the process by which we may come to understand the natural world.    You would tell billions of Hindus that they're wrong... I fail to see why it's any different for me to tell you that you're wrong.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	"So you were put in this world for......nothing?"    We weren't put in this world at all idiot. We just exist.    "and Science made the universe?"    No. Science is a explanation for what happens.  Scientific theory's are thousands of times more plausible then some magic man in the sky creating us.    " and all those billions of people in the world who believe in a Creator are wrong?"    Most people aren't Christians. Do you believe there wrong? You see, your question is as ignorant as humanity, which is still very ignorant.    "Do u believe that you do whatever you want in this world and then when you die, nothing happens, you just die?"    Yup. No reason to believe otherwise.|`|25Cu0kjFaa	First of all, I wasn't put on this world. I was born, the result of a sexual act performed between a very nice couple sometime in mid-to-late November of 1965. I am who i am today because one particular sperm outswam the rest.    Yes, I just die. Annoying, but that's what all the evidence points to, alas.    Science is a method for investigation. It doesn't do anything. Though science has shown hard evidence for the Big Bang. Look up Galactic Red Shift and CBE.    The majority used to think the world was flat. They were wrong. The majority used to think there were only five planets in the solar system, and everything, including the sun, revolved around the Earth. They were wrong. The majority once thought that disease was caused by evil spirits. They were wrong.    So why couldn't the majority be wrong again?    Oh, the universe wasn't made. It started with a rapid expansion from a singularity called the Big Bang (in popular culture). Everything else proceeded according to well-understood physical principles.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	> Do u believe that you do whatever you want in this world   > and then when you die, nothing happens, you just die?    Yes.  Except that I have to live with the consequences of everything I do, and so do my children, and their children, etc.    > So you were put in this world for......nothing?    Yes.  There was no outside intention that I exist.    It is a wonderful accident of nature as is every life.  It is up to me to make something useful out of my very limited life,   if that is what I want.    > and Science made the universe?    No.  Science is the process of unraveling how the universe works, by testing every human idea (hypothesis).      No one made the universe, as far as I can tell.    I don't yet understand the origin of the universe.    > and all those billions of people in the world   > who believe in a Creator are wrong?    I'm pretty sure of that, because their ideas are not subject to being tested to find out if they are wrong and their conclusions flatter them so much (always a bad sign).  There is little chance people just imagined the correct answer to these big questions.  There are too many possibilities and the human mind is too tiny (only the ego part is essentially infinite).    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|ulwXFrrJaa	how is babby formed?  |`|DQjAGWXQaa	Pretty much.|`|PsWzUuTtaa	Um...yes?|`|1iWNBBMfaa	Um.. yes pretty much so except for the Science-thing.|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	in a word -- yes.      well, except for the part about "science made the universe."

'Science' is a human construct for understanding the universe. Nobody thinks it's an omnipotent being that created everything, dummy. If you mean was the universe formed by non-sentient naturalistic forces, then yes.    Since I wasn't 'put' in this world, that claim is irrelevant. I am merely here to live my life. And yes, at the end of everything, you die. It's fairly simple to understand.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Pretty much. I think we don't know for sure what happens after death as I haven't died yet and no one who has died has ever come back to tell me about it. So far though with the credible evidence we have this is the only life I'm counting on. I think once we are here we can choose to create meaning in our lives by what we choose to do with it. I do think all the different gods people have come up with are the product of human imagination and fulfill a psychological need for some people.

And yes all those people are most probably wrong, truth is not a democracy.|`|cNniG2L0aa	"Science made the universe"  Only fundie would suggest that cos no one in their right mind would do so.    "all those billions of people in the world who believe in a Creator are wrong"  They are; it's nothing to do with the number of people who believe something to be true (look at the muslims and hindus - they think they're right too).  It all has to do with the logic.    If I look around I see stuff happening to all and sundry regardless of thought or deed EXACTLY as if there was NO invisible sky critter.    Regardless if anyone else notices or not I'm going with what I can see with my own eyes.    Ive discovered that it all boils down to brain wiring: your brain is wired to worship magic or it isnt, either its wired to utilize logic or it isnt, either its analytical of myths or it isnt.

My personal decision to believe or not believe in something has been well thought out. Its not like I woke up one day and decided "hey I dont believe in god" I actually thought about it for years and have slowly come to my decision.    EDIT: to answer your edits, I think the universe is like a heart. When you see an animated heart beat it expands and contracts. Nothing in this universe completely goes away, everything gets recycled. So this could just be the leftovers from a previous universe.|`|W0qNkROpaa	Yes, basically.

It happens in nature all the time.    Well, biologically we are here to replicate our DNA. Any other purpose we define for ourselves.    No, science did not make the universe. The universe has been around a lot longer than science which only really began during the enlightenment.    Yes, I think all those billions of people are wrong. The popularity of an idea has nothing to do with its veracity. Do not take comfort in the false security of consensus. You don't say what religion you adhere to but whichever one it is means you reject all the rest. Which means you are making an identical claim: that the billions who practice a different religion are wrong.|`|aj5IBTuXaa	Atheists have morals based on the Golden Rule (which isn't actually Christian, you know...  It way predates even the O.T.)    When you're gone, you're gone.  If you are lucky enough to have loved ones, you are just a memory.  If not, you are a forgotten memory.    We were NOT put in this world, for "put" conveys a meaning that is not correct.  "Put" implies that someone with the power to put us here did that.  We were brought into the wold by our parents who wanted to leave behind some legacy.  Or we were an accident. My second grandson was an accident.  A happy accident.    Science makes nothing.  Scientifically describable forces made the universe.  Time made the universe.    As to the billions of people who believe in a creator.... yep, that about sums it up.  All wrong.  Just remember, 50 billion flies eat dung, but I won't be joining them for dinner.  So much for the theory of large numbers.  That is, a mistaken belief is a mistaken belief despite the numbers who believe that way.

Therefore listen to what I am saying to you carefully and take these words to those who could not be present here today.    O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that He will indeed reckon your deeds. Allaah has forbidden you to take usury (Interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived...     Beware of Satan, for your safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.     O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have right over you. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to commit adultery.     O People, listen to me in earnest, worship Allaah, say your five daily prayers (Salaah), fast during the month of Ramadaan, and give your wealth in Zakaat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to. You know that every Muslim is the brother of another Muslim. You are all equal. Nobody has superiority over other except by piety and good action.    Remember, one day you will appear before Allaah and answer for your deeds. So beware, do not astray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.     O People, no prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore, O People, and understand my words which I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Qur'an and my example, the Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray.     All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly.

Lewis once wrote 'The Great Divorce', a work of fiction in which some people in Hell go for a day trip to the edge of Heaven. He said in the introduction that he did not intend the story to be taken literally, in fact he was opposed to any attempt to work out the details of what Heaven and Hell were like, but he sketched out some fascinating ideas. I found it a worth while read even though I am not a Christian and am not even sure if there is a life after death.     He depicts Hell as a place of utter boredom. Grey houses, overcast sky. Each person in Hell spends all their time thinking about themselves and most of them cannot be bothered to go on the free day trip to Heaven, figuring that it won't be any good. Nearly all those who do go spend the entire time grumbling. (This part could be read as a satire on the downside of the British Character!)    In Heaven, it is possible to feel. The denizens of Hell hate that and can't wait to go back to the endless grey boredom of Hell. Just one person stays behind. He accepts that it will take a long time to come to terms with reality.     I'm not sure if he meant it that way, but his account is consistent with the idea that people create their own Heaven and Hell.|`|WZ6YXDODaa	Are you on crack?|`|h1eBWehMaa	there is no such thing as luck, and no|`|24507d459775ede5fdae932098289feeaa	If your in heaven, there is no more sin and there's no way for you to go to hell.|`|f2AWSb48aa	You are not locked in, security is tight though, and Jesus sometimes organises day trips to visit hell, to point and laugh at all the sinners.|`|9GuqdXa2aa	Obviously this is ridiculous.

What you're going through is a period of self realization that everyone goes through.  What you need to do relax and give yourself time to just "be".

It just so happens it'll all happen with a really great guy.    Life is so much more than high school.  It's so much more than the commitments you feel you have.  It's about living your life the way it feels right to you, and as tough as things feel right now, they are getting better.  Being gay is getting more and more accepted, but that doesn't mean it will always be easy.  What it does mean is that you'll have different challenges, not more, just different.  If you don't feel like you can tell your family, then don't right now, do it when the time feels right for you.  But never forget that it's your life, you're your own bunch of molecules floating around in space, and it's up to you what you do with them.

The Jewish people he killed did not do any of these and so go to hell.     Most Christians do not accept this about their own religious beliefs and will venomously oppose this. They do not believe in their own religion and argue against it.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	Tonya, I think the word that best describes this scenario is fidelity.  If we believe our religion, our faith, then we are faithful to it.

That person must repent of their critical position or be excommunicated.  In other words, if we claim to have a testimony of our faith, our church, our religion, then we sustain the leaders and the doctrines thereof.  If we become critical of the leaders, the doctrines or precepts, then we need to carefully examine our reasons and determine if we are at fault or if the thing we are criticizing is truly at fault.  If we decide the later is correct, then we had better be prepared to change religions because we will have lost our fidelity that is essential to God's doctrines.  Remember that Christ considers our faithfulness to Him and the church to be equal to our faithfulness in marriage.  That is why He always used the marriage analogy.  We can't have it both ways.  We either sustain and support or we are in the process of apostatizing.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	They're a member technically, but lack the faith to use their membership to their advantage.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	Possible, but not likely.  It's like some Mormons getting angry at the Mormon church for being for Prop 8.  I say, if you don't like the religion, leave it, don't try to change everyone else, so you can be happy.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	I don't get what the issue is about this.  There are so many denominations in Christianity that don't see everything the same.  So those folks are speaking out about the others.  And then within each denomination there are issues that individuals don't 100% agree with other individuals.      Of course its possible, it happens all the time.    For instance, people commonly associate being anti-gay with being Christian.  But that's typically the conservative Christians.  I don't fall into that group and speak out in advocacy for their rights and against what I believe is misinterpretation from my conservative brothers and sisters.    Yes, we are all still members of the same overall religion.  The common theme for Christians is that we all still believe in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.  Each religion on the earth experiences differences within their memberships.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	Absolutely. Crisis occurs within the religious community constantly. People who do not speak against evil in the Church are doing a disservice to their faith and to their Church family.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I think that technically they're a member, but that attitude will eventually lead to them completely leaving the church altogether.    Someone above said that they sometimes disagree with what their church leaders say, but they agree with the doctrine. What the church leaders say IS the doctrine.|`|JWjlyztBaa	Sounds like someone with conviction.|`|AFDgHtZCaa	I like to think that because of God's grace I've been enlightened(someone else might have a different name for me but I could care less). You see I'm presently & for over 50 years I have been a member of the United Methodist church.    In that time I have been a lay leader(second to the pastor in my church), a S.S. teacher(for the last 31 years) & many other positions of responsibility.    And while I love my God & my church I have told my pastor & others  in authority that we have "drifted far from the teachings of our founder John Wesley to the point there we ONLY preach-teach a watered- down social gospel".    I've read many different answers here(some calling me "hypocritical") &  I could care less about them as I only choose to follow Christ as He leads.    Friends do you really "know" Christ as your Savior or do you just "know OF Him",    IF YOU DON'T KNOW CHRIST AS YOUR PERSONAL SAVIOR REPENT & BELIEVE IN HIM FOR SALVATION AS HE'S SOON COMING BACK!!!|`|AA12070800	Do you ever argue or disagree with members of your family?  Unfortunately, I think some religions are stuck in a dying paradigm of "you're either with us or against us," with no room for doubt or dissension.  I don't think this is healthy.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I think it's REFRESHING!|`|jBYxEX8taa	Hypocrites?...|`|Z5VCTFruaa	I would call that type of person a hypocrite.|`|GqNZInUbaa	one foot on the gas and the other on the break ?|`|77b2610047fd4e5f740d75e96c9a88a2aa	I guess it just depends on what you mean by "speak out".   I've disagreed with certain things leaders in our church have said and I've been vocal about that at times.  But I've never disagreed with doctrine.    EDIT:  Well, obviously people speak out and are still members.  I don't bother giving them more labels.  Usually we don't know the whole story.    ALISSA...not everything an LDS church leader says is doctrine.  I once heard a bishop tell his congregation that if they doubled their fast offering, their income would double.  Now, while increasing fast offering is clearly a good thing, what he said is not doctrine and is definitely not true.  The only way you consider everything that comes out of a leader's mouth doctrine is if that leader is infallible.      Here's the issue with this question, and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone.  This question and the answers it's getting seems to be creating a divide.  At one point or another, we've all had something we've struggled to gain a testimony on.  Just because we didn't post a question about it on the internet doesn't mean we didn't struggle with something.  I say we worry about ourselves and let other's be.  Perhaps things are being said, or questions are being posed merely to help gain an understanding.  Maybe that's not the case, but I vote for giving people the benefit of the doubt.|`|AA12203324	Um, isn't that what Jesus did? Along with Mohamed, Siddhartha and just about every other religious founder?|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	I know someone who is a Papal Knight - he regularly criticises the far right of Catholicism.|`|luwBPdE8aa	Martin Luther did it.  He really was not trying to start another religion.|`|iC1mo3toaa	yes. There apostates in the churches. An apostate is one that was saved but goes back to prevously sinful ways. They stay in the church but try to bring it down to their sinful level.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	It's called critical friendship.  Blind loyalty is never a virtue.    Just because my wife loves me it doesn't mean she thinks I'm perfect; just because I belong to a church and support it financially doesn't mean I'm unaware of its faults.    Obviously if the basic principles of a religion start to get up your nose, so that you spend more time criticising it than defending it, it's time to find yourself another one.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	It's all subjective.  To "true believers" steeped in dogma, that person might be considered a heretic. People got burned for that. Now, they might just be excommunicated.  Out of such criticism, however, has come new religions.  Protestantism is obvious, but even more obvious is Christianity, itself. Its founders were Jewish. They attributed to Jesus preaching such change, including his challenging the Sanhedrin and the priesthood.  Ironically, most of the real "reforms" preached by Jesus were later incorporated into Judaism (such as abolition of the priesthood) while the Roman Catholic Church adopted some of the worst of what he tried to reform.  To most Jews at the time of Jesus, he would have seemed a heretic. Those who called him Messiah were surely seen as heretics.|`|1e2aa41e34c037a92a687f6f7fcfcd71aa	They're usually persecuted, excommunicated, and in some cases, even executed.  Jesus was a good example of this type of person.|`|jRcdbna5aa	Of course you can.  In fact, the entire Protestant Reformation was started by Catholics who wanted to reform the Catholic Church.  The nice word for what you are looking for is "reformer."  You could call them, "whistle-blowers," too, if you wanted.|`|4il3LtwIaa	No. But i know it is possible. I am a living example, i am a nazarene (christian) and i'll cite few examples.  1.Many  christians say "Jesus Christ" this combination speaks volumes.If you believe that Jesus is the son of God, then you are saying  that God's last name is Christ. That would mean that God has a father and mother.  2. Why would you call your savior by a nickname ( JESUS). Jesus does not mean a thing. But "YESHUA" means saviour. Yeshua ben/bar Yosef Ha Mashiah, that is Yeshua son of Yosef the messiah.  3. Genisis 1:1 in hebrew > In the beginning the "Gods" (Elohim) created the skies and the land.|`|ApyKiltXaa	This event has happened throughout history.      Josh. 24: 15.    15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will eserve the Lord.     During the Savior's teachings they were existant too.  Wolves in sheep's clothing they were called.    There could be various reasons for doing it.  The manner in which each event could occurs is indicitive of the cause.      I think that the root of it will be found in the contention that it creates.  The author of contention is the adversary.  It would be his intent to disrupt the faith and cause conflict.
uGIIR9Beaa	Yes I have. Just as much as I do when seeing John Doe/Jane Doe graves (those are graves of people never identified). While I can never have children, all I can hope for is that the baby has had a warm and good time with her/his mother while being carried, or for the brief period spent with the parents if born.    These are the moments where you could put down a small token. Maybe a small field flower, a coin, even a button from your coat while ignoring what other people may think of you. This does not have to be your baby to still feel sorry anyway. Sympathy in such a way not only gives a good thought to the baby (or whoever you pay sympathies to) but it helps you turn a sad cry into a good cry.    I hope this answer holds some value and help for you. :)|`|d44d8834433f98c3a93f35f420d4a381aa	Have you ever been to a cemetery.

I know there probably somewhere better but I think what if there not and they could have had such a good life. Makes me sad. I guess everything happens for a reason.|`|JSYHYh7paa	yes, especially if the baby only lived for a very short amount of time.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Yeah. Cemeteries in general freak me out. I look around all see all the names and dates and wonder who they are and how they died. And the old graves that the names have worn off are cool. But the first time I ever saw a babies grave was when I was 5/6 and it had never struck me that babies could die. It took me three days to calm down.|`|syIp6d2Naa	I don't cry much, and I sure don't know the feeling of how tragic the loss of a child must be. I have been doing our families genealogy and over and over in the past women lost children at birth or shortly after because they didn't have the advantages of a doctor or even when they did the doctor having the knowledge like now. My grandmother had a brother that died in the first month after birth. There are whole sections of family lines nearly wiped out during epidemics of flu, or other medical problems. One of my great-great aunts lost 7 of 10 children to an epidemic. I can't fathom something that traumatic and still you had to keep going because the rest of the family needed you. I think I would be stone crazy.   As far as the category you asked the question in to those that wonder about it sometimes a question ends up in the right place. How much more sympathetic are we to others and their traumas. Be they are immediate to the person asking or as this one is, just asking.

Hopefully the people who do believe this will then go home and get a grip!|`|oTKkXEjUaa	The reason for this assumption that the world will end on December 12, 2012 comes from astrology. This entire thing was predicted at another time. I'm sorry that I can't remember when it was right now. I learned a lot about this at one time but now I'm all a bit foggy on it. But basically the reason is that a lot of religion is based on astrology and an "equinox"(or something like it...lol sorry) will end on 12/12/2012 and many different cultures found that and it was interpreted or misintepreted and in some instances confused over time that instead of an age ending, the world would end. So that is the reason for all the different cultures coming up with the same date. It is because some time period having to do with astrology will end, not the world.    Sorry I'm a little hazy on the hard facts.|`|3nhqFx02aa	I don't think that It's going to happen.  I don't think that God would tell anyone about the end of the world one way or another.

itC6iSgzaa	Someone who is bi-curious is generally more attracted to the opposite sex, but is remotely interested in the same sex. Sometimes, it is solely sexual. Sometimes, you may want to pursue a relationship with the same sex. The difference between bi-curiosity and bi-sexuality is that if you are bi sexual, you are sure that you like the same sex and you like the same sex significantly. A bi curious person either isn't sure, or likes the same sex a tiny bit but not enough to label themselves bi sexual.    I have always wondered if a gay person who is slightly attracted to the same sex is also bi curious. Well, hope my answer helped.|`|w1pUF8U2aa	In a nut shell Bi curious are those people who are unsure of their own sexuality and questioning it|`|UPwTgHGwaa	its wen ur not really sure wat u r nd u wanna try it wit the same sex|`|AA11302074	they know they like chicks and want to try dudes out it is really quite interesting.

QK4r41Hqaa	you know those little bottles that are candy? They've got some sorta soda in them, and the bottles are made of wax. you bite off the top of them to drink the contenst, and they're REALLY small!  You can find them at Cracker Barrel.    Get one of those, and bite off two chuncks of it. flatten them out, and  fold them so it makes a round cone shapped thing. It'll take a couple tries to get the right size btw. fortunatly the candy bottle things cost next to nothing.    Do this carefully! Put the wax on a tooth pick and use a lighter to melt the wax together. If you do not feel safe doing this, it's posible to get them to stick using your fingers.  You'll need two of them    and then put them over your teeth- press them around your real teeth- it'll stay on really well!  I wouldn't think eating wht them would work.    If you have some spare cloths, you can mix some chocolate surup with red food die. It looks a lot like blood- but will stain skin and cloths.    You can get some really cheep fake blood at wallmart, it looks pretty real acually. Not sure if you can get it when it's not halloween though :(    I've not tried this, but maybe chocolate surup and ketchup. Then the ketchup doesn't look unnaturally red. That wouldn't stain and you could put it around your mouth.    Acrilic pain, wattered down, looks really realistic too.

RC5RAzykaa	In general, Americans are quite the confused people,  We drive on parkways and park in driveways  We have locks on the doors of establishments that are open 24hours a day 7 days a week.  We are the fattest people on the earth, yet our society idolizes skinny little anorexic heroin addicted waifs  We are "one nation under God" who have denied God and deified ourselves.  We are a "tolerant" society that hates people who speak against our lack of values.  We spend more money on war than on feeding our hungry.  We fight against taxation tooth and nail, then complain when we do not have national health care.    We have fallen from the precepts on which our nation was based.    We will be instrumental in the rise of Satanic ideology worldwide, indeed we have already started.    We are the "ugly Americans"    edit: p.s. Brits eat "blood pudding" and I think this is about the most disgusting thing I have ever heard of.|`|GbDAfs5Yaa	It makes sense to us...the only one that it doesn't make sense to is you!!  Why do you British make things sound so confusing??|`|4Vmlf902aa	Um the Americans invented Football. I'm not talking about soccer but THE STEELERS BEAT THE CARDINALS 27-23 LAST NIGHT  football. I'm guessing we call soccer, soccer cause we use a soccer ball. You don't hear the Spanish complaining about us calling futbol soccer.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	actually i think we call rugby rugby, its different than our football  it's like bloodier or without pads or something  i dont know why we call (american) football by that  and soccer is an odd word but thats just what we've chosen for it|`|StRaKUf6aa	Because we want to be different. :-P|`|6n527pAYaa	Colloquial English differs from country to country and place to place.

I don't know who told ya we did, but they were incorrect... And why we call your foorball soccer.. I have no idea. Thats always confused me too|`|gb9ERmHPaa	Rugby is football, it is Rugby to us.  When we say football, we are reffering to American Football.  When we talk about the football the world plays (but not so much in the states) we call it soccer.  That is to avoid confusion.  American football involves punting, fieldgoal kicking, and kickoff's, there is lot's of kicking involved.  Nobody in america plays rugby and only girls and pussys play soccer.|`|t4F59gf2aa	What do you care why not have a steaming spotted d*ck and chill out, I don't care what you call your "sports".

It's like the lag between 'canadian french' and 'france french'.    It has evolved differently.|`|jJAENrvUaa	same reason we don't use the metric system i guess...?    also rugby =/= football... it's different.  i don't know how.  but we refer to rugby as rugby.  also the feet are involved in football, like when you have to kick to punt or a field goal.    also we probably didn't have soccer but had football.  and then when y'all came over with like "this is football" we were like fu    Soccer is the sound that the ball makes when it's not inflated enough and you kick it and it just kind of flops ... sakkarrr...    also did you know that there are lots of "variations" of soccer all over the world it's not just all british rules.  so you should be glad you're calling it football instead of Bola de Pie or whatever they could be calling it in mexico instead of futbol.|`|AA10962298	Hey...don't get me started on weird names that the BRITISH use for stuff...Whatsa matta...can't ya speak ENGLISH?|`|3hkArqvbaa	I don't know.

EDIT: yo give B.A. to skyman that was really interesting!|`|dSmoB64Yaa	You need to read a little bit more, before you start accusing Americans creating the confusion.    1.  Rugby was orginally called Rugy Football, by you Brits, to distinguish it from other forms of football, because The game of football played at Rugby School  permitted handling of the ball. Overtime, rugby evovled to allow running with the ball. It became so different from football, that they simply called it Rugby    2. Soccer is a Brittish term. The Football Association was formed in London in October 1863.  The name Association Football was coined to distinguish it from Rugby and other forms of Football. The abbreviation, Soccer, comes from Brtitish slang and is taken from the word "Association", with an er added to the end, in the same way that Brits call Rugby, Ruggers.    3. American Football evolved from Rugby Football. It was originally called American Football, but as Rugby died out in America, it eventually became known to Americans simply as Football.    So, the only thing confusing is, why is a Yank explaining this to a Brit, when you should already know this, because all of the terms Rugby, Soccer and Football are essentially Brittish terms. You could have looked all of this up yourself, but some Yanks are friendly enough to help our Brit brothers out. You are welcome.|`|gQloDbGDaa	yeah. we americans are actually pretty dumb. but it's okay.|`|DBIgAIBZaa	Rugby is rugby here. Football is 'American football' and Soccer is soccer here|`|31gN5L58aa	because we americans are fatties who eat at mcdonalds, and go home and scratch our buts while watching the super bowl....jk jk  lol italians rule!!!!|`|QjHqiNZiaa	I am american dumbass, and we call football.....football, and rugby.....rugby.....and soccer....soccer.......get a life and leave american if you dont like us|`|Sd4IfH2faa	you kind of confused ME there for a sec lolz. actually american football is the full term for our type of "rugby." ans we call soccer 'soccer' O.o your thinking of the hispanic speaking countries where soccer is football|`|3c57UA3Yaa	* Why do Brits use 'loo' instead of toilet?  * What about 'knickers'? whats up with that?     * And why do you refer to lunch/brunch as tea? you have me thinking you drinking tea 24 hours a day.    Edit:..I quite like your cursing though:    Bugger,shite,sod,c*nt, a*sehole, bollocks,wanker,tosser,knobend,    and your insults have a certain flair that us Americans lack. That's really the only thing that I'm jealous of.  ...Sod your accents.|`|5zhgaiW9aa	Cus America is a great place but somtimes likes to steal idea,I invented CRZIM after all =)    (Its really gum but i renamed it)  You understand now?

mfSp38yzaa	Yes. You need to ask ASAP though; the longer you wait, the less likely it will happen. You need to speak to your Pastor, and he can determine whether or not he feels you can accelerate the process.    Being that you haven't been to Church in a while, it could be a problem. I can tell you that, even if they let you shorten the time, they WILL want you to take the classes/counseling together. It's kind of the whole point.    Congratulations. I hope things work out for you to be married in July as you hoped. If it doesn't, I hope you'll wait and be married in the Church. Either way, getting back into Church is the right thing to do.|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	Why is this?

As long as you complete the pre-canonization process, obtain a marriage license and secure a priest to hitch you, then by all means you are able to get married there in that time period.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	if you are members of the parish and the priest knows you -- it could happen. they may offer a weekend marriage encounter/retreat for couple that are in separate states.

As I understand it, six months preparation is minimal.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Possibly. You would have to work with the priest(s) who are doing your instruction to see what the scheduling is like and what the requirements are in the diocese in which you wish to marry.|`|AA11796124	>    That all depends. . .       >    I would recommend your Catholic Faith become a priority. Weekly Mass attendance is now a reality in your life.    If you're ging to ask the Church to bestow upon you a Holy Sacrament, better show you're taking things seriously by becoming an active Catholic.      >    For that you will each need to consult your respective parish priests. It might be difficult to take marriage prep separately because so many of the exercises require participation from the couple.      >    You two really need to talk to the priest at the parish you two plan to be married in. Contact him as soon as possible.

HvIS1Mk1aa	School is not, and has never been, a free baby-sitting service.    I find it absolutely appalling that people expect it to serve as one.    And it is sad in the extreme that you would jeopardise the welfare of your kids by driving them in dangerous conditions.    Have you considered give them up for adoption, seeing as they're obviously such a terrible inconvenience to you?    That will save you the trouble of passing the buck for looking after them on to teachers.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Yeah I know this is not fair. They never closed school here for having a sandstorm.|`|ToztjpAsaa	I live in a rural area and a lot of kids get school buses from outlying villages.  It was annoying that the schools were closed, in spite of the main roads being clear this morning, but I guess the school bus contractors didn't want to take the risk, particularly with the snow that was forecast for later in the day.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	It's a safety issue, first and foremost.|`|lwXEK969aa	The roads being too slippery is just a cover story...........the truth is that the teachers just want to go sledging and make snow men|`|YupMCYHlaa	It's the bureaucratic mentality, but also the way people think in general.  If the school isn't closed on a snowy day, and a kid falls and breaks a bone, or a school bus has an accident, then parents sue the school saying it was the school's fault because they didn't close the school.  So school administrators, wanting to cover their a**, close the school.    It's the fault of administrators who are only concerned in avoiding lawsuits, but it is also the fault of parents who will sue the school with the least provocation.  We are a very litigious culture, and someone whose kid is in a minor accident thinks he's won the lottery.  So bureaucrats want to protect themselves from people like this.|`|Ovj7Nf25aa	Because the courts of law will allow parents to hit the lotto jackpot by suing the school system if the school bus has an accident and their children get hurt.......!!|`|pJXtfzfjaa	I'm sure it has to do with anticipating a large number of staff members calling in because of bad weather.  Sometimes we get "snow" days because it's too cold out.  I'm not sure what the cut off is, but on really cold days, schools close down, too.    I understand it can be frustrating.  Good luck.|`|441GSyaMaa	Health and safety. I mean some people have to travel a fair few miles in some cases, so if there is a risk of crashing cars (especially in the school rush where incompetent parents feel the need to drive their child 3 minutes from their home...) and people get angry and... it's just simply dangerous.    And it's always nice to have an unexpected day off :-P|`|2016b2eff949f27f73d7f010484e92fcaa	A lot of roads weren't gritted today. Teachers found it difficult to get to school. Some couldn't make it and there was a lack of teachers so they had to close it. And trains were another problem.     A few years ago, in my primary school, the school was half closed. They kept all children whose parents couldn't look after them, and if their parents could they could go home. That makes sense to me and I don't see why all schools aren't like that. Everyone spent the day watching films, playing games and playing outside.    Other countries get worse than we do and they can cope with it, but we can't.|`|4AMJ0uV8aa	Well firstly most teachers do not live in walking distance of the school that they work at. Secondly its for the health and safety of the children, for instance they could get snowed in at the school and they may not be able to leave, so teachers would have to stay there also, there may be no heating (as most are on a set timer) and no food.  It doesn't happen all the time, so what harm will a couple of days do?|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	Laziness on the part of some ******* who won't be bothered to drive kids to school|`|d77e08f79b80ca282637c03b94d35e2eaa	They closed the schools because the teachers couldnt get there, perhaps they have a longer journey than you.|`|ydvTcSEEaa	Well, at my school there are people from two villages just outside that get a contract bus.   When is snow's the bus driver finds it hard to drive to the school from the village so sometimes the people from the village don't have to come to school, so if they don't have to go to school neither do the other pupils because it's not fair if they can't get to school because of weather conditions.|`|DGFc8TbLaa	"the truth is that the teachers just want to go sledging and make snow men."      This is the truth, I swear whoever wrote this knows it.!.|`|l3EVUl91aa	i think its great, my kids have never seen snow like this, i've never seen so many kids out playing, adults aswell, cant wait for tomorrow, enjoy it while it lasts, memorys are more important than money.|`|tenSP4hVaa	Because its for safty   We dont want to repeat any bus or car crashes  Surely your child safty is more important than going to school for a day|`|8e61d66e6ed2a56e50fe9d87a9b583f1aa	snow is no excuse to close schools. it rarely heavy snow in london. the local authorities are not well equipped to clear the snow. canada is the country where snow fall is heavy but the local government or authority are well prepared to deal the snow. most of the european countries have heavy snow but no school closures. the local council is responsible to deal with situation and they are answerable to public for their carelessness. WE PAY COUNCIL TAX AND IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF LOCAL COUNCILS TO LOOK AFTER THE NATURAL CLAMITIES LIKE SNOW, FLOOD ETC. THAN CLOSING SCHOOL AND PUT PARENTS IN TROUBLE. THE COUNCIL SHOULD BE WELL PREPARED TO DEAL THE HEAVY SNOW FALL.|`|p9Z6WnGFaa	its a health and safety issue. Think of all of the kids trying to get to school from far away!!!!     There is a hill on the way up to my neighbours school and it is seriously slippy, i would probably have to take them out of school if it got really bad  not that i would want to, but there is a drop beside it and cars drive quite fast!    I know its a pain but it usually dosent snow but let them enjoy it!
57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	Jehovah reserves the right to hear prayers of his faithful servants on the earth.  He is a very loving God and keeps his angelic army busy by delegating responsibility.  Only listening to the prayers fo his true followers does he reserve the right to listen to and to answer their heart felt prayers.  Satan and the demons do not care who listens to the prayers directed to them, they just enjoy tormenting mankind.  So I know I have an open communication with Jehovah, I can say what I need to in my heart, out loud or with my children, so why would I feel the need to write a letter, when my heart will speak for me when I can not find the words to utter them.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	How you could you be heard, your writing a letter, not actually making noise?

You have to do something because later, when you meet him, you don't want that to get in the way.  For instance, if he's going to be sick for a long time, trust me, everyone is doing the math and they know you were around when he first went to the hospital-but you didn't do anything.  A card is a nice gesture, but it's not as personal as, say, an awkward phone call. Or as showy as a bouquet of flowers.  You want to do something nice, but you don't want to show up anyone either.  You're still new to their circle.|`|YJO1O49faa	you've only been dating for 3 months so you don't need to leap into his room and throw flowers and candys and cards about.

Then either you or him give his dad the present and say jokingly "i haven't gotten to know you so i needed your son's help to find something that he'd know you'd like."  or something along those lines    get well to your boyfriend's dad and good luck!
ncdTxID9aa	I have been hearing that schools in low income areas have less learning materials/supplies than that of schools in upper class neighborhoods.  To me, a teacher is a teacher.  There are many ways to educate children in their studies.  All schools have computers, text books, supplies for many studies, science, math etc.  Some schools may be more advanced but the general topics are still taught.  What it is is the lack of participation the child has.  If parents aren't strict on their child's learning skills, the child is going to focus less on their work.  A child can be sent to school, come home, say they have no home work or even if so their parents will just leave them to themselves where they can easily say "I don't feel like doing this" or "I don't understand this"  A child has to be disciplined and if needs extra attention, should have a tutor.  That's that, as far as being juvenile delinquents.  Lack of interest in education leads them to be consumed by whatever else surrounds them, trouble, violence and ending up in the justice system.|`|arzMFm6raa	It's the Black culture that is at fault. Obama was raised by his white grandparents and no other black person was around...|`|vYaTOkdRaa	That is a loaded question and people will say what is acceptable to repeat in public.  Truth is parents bear most of the responsibility when it comes to their children.  Choices that a person makes before and after a child is born have a profound effect on their behavior.  Why are so many single black girls getting pregnant?  Why are so many black boys not taking up their responsibility as fathers? Why does black culture glamorize sex and violence in their music, fashion and lifestyle?  Why do so many black parents neglect their responsibilities and in many cases act like children themselves?  I work in a school and see this every day. These sort of questions are taboo for fear of being labeled a racist and so are not explored, properly debated and dealt with.  Until then more prisions are in order I am afraid and generations of precious talent wasted.|`|StRaKUf6aa	The less educated behave in more outrageous ways.  A child who is in school all day does not have the time required to commit the shenanigans of a child who participates in school.  Children who are more focused at school do better in life and get into less trouble.    Where's the problem in the educational system?  In many schools in inner-city neighborhoods, the teachers don't express the same care for the students as the teachers in more suburban schools.  This leads not only to the children disliking school (even more so than normal) but it also leads to the children acting out and committing offenses, some of them criminal.    That's only a starting part, as it goes much deeper than that.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	The education of African Americans lags behind those of other U.S. ethnic groups, such as European Americans and Asian Americans, as reflected by test scores, grades, urban high school graduation rates, rates of disciplinary action, and rates of conferral of undergraduate degrees.Indeed, high school graduation rates and college enrollment rates are comparable to those of whites 25 or 30 years ago. Although the African immigrant population actually has the highest educational attainment of any group in the United States, they represent a small group.    The correlation Between the two are as follows Since the 1950s, social ecology studies have built on the social disorganization theories. Many studies have found that crime rates are associated with poverty, disorder, high numbers of abandoned buildings, and other signs of community deterioration. As working and middle class people leave deteriorating neighborhoods, the most disadvantaged portions of the population may remain. William Julius Wilson suggested a poverty "concentration effect", which may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence.|`|AA10232076	Well, I'm not sure if this is useful, but the less education a person receives, the more likely a person will end up in prison. For instance, a high school dropout is more likely than a graduate to end up living a life of crime. So since blacks have a higher dropout than other races, because of the social lifetyle in the general black community, although it is decreasing, is part of the reason why it's like that.|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	I don't think it has as much to do with the kind of education they receive, as it does with the cultural issue with having a mother & father both together raising them. Most of them have the mother and the father is not present. I teach high school kids 9-12, and my home room kids are freshmen. Out of the 4 African American boys, 2 passed their classes with B'c and C's, and the other two keep getting ISS and suspended because of their poor behavior in school, being where they should not be in the halls, trying to deal, etc. I find that the parents of any child who both have a mother and father are more likely to be concerned for their child and take care of the grade/behavior issues, and their child is more likely to graduate, as opposed to children with a 1 parent home. One girl in my class shows up 90 mins late every day, I called her mother over 5 times and she still expresses concern, and yet does nothing to improve her attendance. I have seen this with several single parents who struggle to work and keep an eye on their kids.    And to people who dare say that city teachers dont care as much as suburban teachers do know much about teachers and the sh** we have to go through in the city with half the funds than suburban schools get and 100% more problems with parents, even getting a parent on the phone, how about try to get a parent to give the school the right phone number, or even a phone that works. On report card day out of 180 kids I see 10 parents. Yes, 10. Put the responsibility on the kids for not doing their home work and on the parents who cant raise their kids and teach them priorities.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Our education system did not fail. I am so tired of people blaming the teachers and government for children that are failing or performing badly. If a child wants to do good in school than he will. There are teachers in the school who they learn from (even if the teacher doesn't care about the kids, she is still required to teach). Virtually all schools offer "extra-help", and they have teachers available.     Every town has a library, even if their library is small, the Librarian can order books from neighboring districts. There is the internet, I noticed that a lot of kids are spending a lot of money on phones nowadays. Libraries are usually pretty close to most schools, so distance shouldn't be a problem.    Well, guess what, not only can you text on a cell-phone but you can also access the internet, so I don't want to hear about somebody being to poor to access the internet. Most kids have Cable/Satelite Television and TV is very educational. So instead of watching MTV/BET/VH1, how about turning on the History Channel?  If you have IO Digital Cable Service than there are MANY extra television channels that are considered educational.    .......................I can go on and on.    Everybody is so quick to blame somebody.    The reason why many African American teen are failing is because of our CULTURE. Instead of glorifying sexuality and violence, how about glorifying education. Lets be real, I'm not saying that there should be a "Just a Bill on Capitol Hill" rap song, I'm saying they should put undertones in their rap songs that make education look positive. Kids are more influenced by culture than you may think.     Race does not play a factor in education levels, Nigerian Americans scored way above White Americans and African Americans in tests and were pretty close to Asian Americans. Most Nigerians are black.

PpaaRkm9aa	All i can do is agree with you, because you are right.|`|StRaKUf6aa	I don't think it's hilarious, but I do see your point.  However, if the system is inherently biased towards blacks and Hispanics and they are imprisoned more often than whites who commit the same crimes, I do see some logic to this argument.|`|CLHhhU5waa	I agree with qwerty,but she explained it so eloquently that I need not give further explanation.|`|Pgbwgq88aa	thats just sad...|`|vNtgnag5aa	A criminal usually chooses to be a criminal (unless its like an accidental homocide), so that person needs to realize the consequence. I do think that its sad that there are more criminals of a certian race, it means they arent getting a proper education because they are wasting away in prison. I do think they should be able to get some form of a job. Maybe not a CEO but at least minimum wage.|`|AA10232076	I mean, a criminal, regardless of race/ethnicity is still a criminal at the end of the day. I mean, I do feel like if a person changes, then they should be allowed back into the mainstream society and be able to work/vote and all that. But, that's hard to tell and determine. I honestly don't know, I guess.|`|8MzVCzi0aa	yeah but as soon as they wanna start discriminating against 'pedofiles' am sure you will be the first one out with a placard rioting on the streets|`|uGezRb7Xaa	considering that people with no criminal past are losing their jobs because of this economy, I am sure the few companies that still have available jobs are just dying to give them to pedophiles and criminals
jcK6EXpiaa	Yes. But not just white people, anybody currently reaping the benefits of my peoples demise, and refusing to accept the truth of it.  IT has nothing necessarily to do with their race, its more to do with their actions/history/ignorance. IF it were Asains that attempted to completely erradicate my people, and inflict barbaric treatment that makes the holocaust look like a trip to disney land, it would be them that we have issues with. It isn't the raceitself, its that the majority of ignorant people tend to be of european descent. But there are a few non-whites I have had an argument with before regarding our history and current events. IM me for more detail, if you want.

You can't blame white people whom are living today for what their ancestors might have done. My great great grandparents (on my dads side) lived on an Indian reservation , and I don't have any racial issues (There are natives on my moms side too, by the way). For some reason it's always the non-Natives that think this. There are some natives that have serious issues though, so I definitely can't say that this is completely untrue.|`|K1LldEykaa	I'm a Native American who was adopted and grew up from day one in the state of NH.  98+ percent of this state is white, with half of the rest being black, half of that being asian, mexican, and maby a handful of Native Americans.    I'm not particularly racist, I don't refer to my self ever as white, and I like to say 'white people this' 'white people that' with the usual NH stereotypes and whatnot. I use this in my favor, to get jobs, get into college, get out of trouble at school, I accused my teacher of being a racist and made a huge commotion at my school. Yet Indians in this part of the country are so rare I've never heard any racial comments towards them ever.    I'm sure I've seen others, but I more than likely mistook them for mexicans.    I'm pissed about the rape of the women/lands but it had to be done, it was justified in a sense. We really didn't own the land, we had no concept of ownership because we were not as advanced society wise. It could've been handled better, and the man still raped the remnants of the tribes, but to survive in this day you need to adapt. Not hang out in your reservation smoking weed all day.    Reparations should be made, in the form of tax cuts, college funding, easier more plentiful food stamps, etc.|`|tBtHiPLGaa	Europeans did kind of invade their country and try to claim it as there own.  Had numerous wars with them.  Force the Trails of Tears Act and Indian Removal Act on them (Both acts try to ethnically cleanse & get rid of them).  Which we kind of success at since there isn't a lot of Native American in USA like it was before we came here.  How did a country that was mainly populated by Native Americans decrease to a country where there are only 1% of them?  Most of them are either mixed out or wiped out.  You wonder why everyone always claiming to have some Native American blood in them.  Anyways we elected Andrew Jackson for president(whom pretty much hated Native American for some strange reason).  I'm pretty sure some still dislike ya, but not all of them.  All races had done something to someones else race in the past.  Let's all forgive and move on.|`|dcWGYBfYaa	The real question is:    Why do Whites have so many racial issues with Native Americans?  .|`|5515fbe4bde3824ce5a0d6e4b8fde157aa	Not in general, but if so then I don't think the Native Americans would be the only group of people with racial issues against whites.

Also, fights have been known to break out in group homes with people getting injured in the process because no one intervened fast enough. Some developmentally disabled persons can be very sweet and mild almost childlike one minute, and in the next moment with very little provocation, they can become very agitated and violent and in that state, they can become a danger to themselves and others.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

IM GAY!!! huhuhu"    just that simple. i hope that helps.|`|fdMKpXCHaa	This all seems unlikely....Your parents had you at 50 years old.....you're 40....flaming.....and they don't know....hmmmm.

Don't make this about you.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	if you're actually telling the truth, I'd say at this point you can probably continue to keep it a secret|`|lvF5Tpniaa	You're going to have to tell them loudly at their age :) ....just a joke to lighten it up.....  Your parents see you and they know who you are. At their age, they have to trust that you have every ability to live with out them. Just let them see that you are happy and content. But they do see you.   Good Luck  PS  Don't forget to relax and breathe...|`|Y6xanshEaa	Your parents had you when they were 50?    O..kay?  Whatever you say,kiddo.

It is never an easy thing for someone your age to do. First you must feel absolutely comfortable and if you are not self dependent then you need to make efforts to become that way in case it is a bad and horrible event. Then you need to start by telling them that you love them very very much and ask them if they love you more than anything. And it helps to remind them of a time where something gay-related happened and they know about. The rest will just come naturally it is very important for your friends and family to know because if you stay in the closet you will never see the sunshine in your life and you will always feel like you are living a lie.

Okay this is seriously the unanswered question. i tried to tell mine, and I ended up outside the house, but then again, that is a different situation. But anyway...    The way to tell your parents is just to sit them down, and explain to them your life style. Don't overthink it, and just let it loose. And you can't do it without shocking them sweetie. Its not possible.|`|IIxAnsWdaa	wow just tell them|`|OsxQNDHzaa	I don't believe you.    Lener 1, member since Febuary 02, 2009.

If you must tell them though, tell them  plainly that you are gay. there isnt much you can do if they really had no idea. best of luck!|`|GHd84xipaa	if they are in their 90's,they will probably say which way.i really don't think they will understand what you are trying to tell them at that age.just don't tell them while they are eating.|`|dzZHjcjQaa	at their time of life isnt it better to leave the matter on the shelf for just a while longer without hurting things dont ya think.

That is no job for a woman.  Can you imagine a woman being at the helm when she is having pms...kaboom, there goes the world...she gets po'd at some country and they're gone...yea I feel that way and I'm a female!!  Hilary being president would have been the dumbest mistake the american voters would have made.|`|3r252UIRaa	He's not black, he's biracial.|`|GrLIOUDgaa	So what's your point? none of the have ever ran for president either, have they? Get over it, he is your president|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I don't think any of those things you mentioned matter in one's choice for president.    Minorities have not had the opportunities until the last century, so it will take time for the others to catch up.    In the U.S., black men got the vote before all women.  We'll have a woman next, but the most important thing in their candidacy is who they are, what they stand for, and their integrity.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	How about this: Let's have a competent president, one that knows what they're talking about and can pronounce basic words.  That's it.  You can be a multiracial drag queen with one leg, just get the job done well.    EDIT: Angela B:    I'm sorry, but your answer is the dumbest thing I've read today.  To say that a woman cannot become president because of PMS is ludicrous, especially for the following reasons:    1. Not every woman experience PMS  2. There are pills for it, anyway  3. Sure, Hilary, a woman who will be 62 this year REALLY has to worry about PMS, right?  What a tool.|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	It's just you. A biracial president is significant enough for now.|`|VhBW7AjAaa	Maybe, but it would be even more significant to elect a president who can actually get us completely out of this financial crisis.|`|ncdTxID9aa	It's not about how long you have been here, and technically, Blacks have been in America for many years.  It's about how well you qualify, how much people like you, your knowledge on the issues and duties as president. It's not about putting a good looking ehtnic man or woman in a suite hoping they can get people to vote for them being non white. I think people are in over their heads about racial boundaries and politics.|`|vYaTOkdRaa	As groundbreaking as that would be it is sad America has not matured enough to see people and not color.

lYQDCJgeaa	The Gnostic teacher Valentinus (c. 105c. 165 CE) identified the Holy Spirit as God the Mother, and efforts were even made to relate the virgin birth to a feminine Holy Spirit rather than to Mary.16 The third-century Iranian teacher, Mani, who founded the sect of Manichaeism, also was convinced that the Holy Spirit was feminine. (SEE SOURCE  1, BELOW)    AND  "Responding to feminist concerns, orthodox theology has noted the following: a) that the names "Father" and "Son" are clearly analogical, since all trinitarians would agree that God has no gender per se, encompassing all sex and gender and being beyond all sex and gender; b) that using "Son" to refer to the second divine person is most proper only when referring to the "Incarnate Word," who is Jesus, a human who is clearly male; and c) that in Semitic languages, such as Hebrew and Aramaic, the noun translated "spirit" is grammatically feminine, and also images of God's Spirit in Scripture are often feminine, as with the Spirit "brooding" over the primordial chaos in Genesis 1, or grammatically feminine, such as a dove in the New Testament.    The last point on the possible femininity of the Holy Spirit is further explored by saying that if the Son is considered to be masculine as the incarnation of the Logos, the masculine term for Word in Greek, then the Holy Spirit can be considered to be feminine as something related to the Sophia, the feminine counterpart that means Wisdom in Greek.    Historically, Coptic Christianity saw the Holy Spirit as the Mother, while regarding the two others as the Father and Son. So did Zinzendorf (1700-1760), the founder of Moravianism. More recently, Catholic scholars such as Willi Moll and Franz Mayr have decided that the Holy Spirit be feminine on the analogy of family relationships."  (SEE SOURCE  2, BELOW)    Short answer, yes, in the past, there were sects that belived in the feminine aspect of God, but modern Christianity has purged those interpretations.    Rabid fundies will dispute that this ever ocurred, but denial does not change the past.    There are also modern sects that hold similar beliefs, but they are far from mainstream Christianity.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	If you are referring to Mother Mary, then she is the most Blessed Woman to have ever lived on this Earth, but she is not part of the trinity. Jesus is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|tsgP2JfBaa	There is a long history in Christianity - particularly in Eastern Catholicism - venerating the sacred feminine in the person of the Virgin Mary, and in the personification of wisdom in the form of Sophia.  Neither of these are included as members of the Trinity.    However, certain Gnostic Christian sects do consider the Trinity to be an actual family unit - God the Father, God the Son, and God the Mother.  In most of these cases, the person of Sophia (not Mary) has been combined with the Holy Ghost into a single mother goddess figure.|`|T5ztIAZbaa	What's more to the point I think is where the heck is that in the BIble??    I don't know of any except for those feminists that have Christian beliefs.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	No.  Since Christianity was based on Judaism, the feminine principle is largely cut out.  You do see it reintroduced in Catholicism through the Virgin Mary, however.|`|57e1885bdade83593ff264411c902959aa	I worked with a Catholic woman many years ago, I was in my late 20's, she was in her 50's. (Old School Catholic)  She informed me that in the Catholic religion, the holy spirit was referred to or known as God's hand maiden and her name was Tabatha.  I thought that was interesting because a T.V. show in the late 60's had a child star named Tabatha in it, the show was Bewitched.  A show about witches which even the world recognizes as someone with supernatural powers given to them by Satan the Devil.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Not that I know of.    God is ONE.

I'm Catholic, and I believe that God is a genderless entity. We refer to God as father, or "he" because "it" just doesn't sound very respectful. God also has very mother like attributes as well as fatherly.|`|Pgbwgq88aa	There is NONE...and if your Christian.... well ur faith is messed up|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	You must first understand that Christianity does not believe that the Holy trinity has a gender at all.  Male, female or other.    Jesus Christ came to earth as an infant and was given male gender, but as God, he has no gender and does not procreate.  God creates, we procreate.  Huge difference.|`|iblT1HJpaa	If one is to follow Scripture, then whatever Jesus did would be correct. And He called God - "Father". Is there any reason to go against the example of Jesus Christ?     There is another reason for this and that is for the Doctrine of Marriage. It is the man, the husband that is to lead the wife and the family in righteousness. (most men can't and will not do this and the whole then falls apart, but this is what Scripture teaches.) We then, look not only to God as Father, but to the man (the father, the dad) for headship and leadership within marriage. This does not preclude the female from becoming a leader and even a pastor, but if you ever ask an Evangelical female pastor what this entails - she will always defer to the husband in the marriage. This is what God wants.     I do not believe that God is "sexless" but that He contains ALL things male and all things female. He IS both for then He knows the intimate nature of all men and all women. Sexless would infer that He knows neither. Wrong theology.   When God said "let us create man in our image" it also included Eve (female) and God said that that was within His image, TOO!!!

If God could control every thought we had, there wouldn't be sins, there wouldn't be killers, there wouldn't be the Devil, and most importantly, there would not be war. Not everyone is good. Some people don't believe in God because they don't think God created us, they think that we evolved from gorillas over time.

Many do, and many only worship God out of expectations of getting something out of it. That is what the Devil said that Job did, only for the wealth and protection.     On the other hand, those who love God for who he is and his ways of dealing with mankind, give that love from the heart.

Good reading>               James      Chapter 4        1          1 Where do the wars and where do the conflicts among you come from? Is it not from your passions 2 that make war within your members?      2          You covet but do not possess. You kill and envy but you cannot obtain; you fight and wage war. You do not possess because you do not ask.      3          You ask but do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.      4          Adulterers! 3 Do you not know that to be a lover of the world means enmity with God? Therefore, whoever wants to be a lover of the world makes himself an enemy of God.      5          Or do you suppose that the scripture speaks without meaning when it says, "The spirit that he has made to dwell in us tends toward jealousy"? 4       6          But he bestows a greater grace; therefore, it says: "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." 5       7          So submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.      8          Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you of two minds.      9          Begin to lament, to mourn, to weep. Let your laughter be turned into mourning and your joy into dejection.      10          Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.      11          Do not speak evil of one another, brothers. Whoever speaks evil of a brother or judges his brother speaks evil of the law and judges the law. 6 If you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.      12          There is one lawgiver and judge who is able to save or to destroy. Who then are you to judge your neighbor?      13          7 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we shall go into such and such a town, spend a year there doing business, and make a profit"--      14          you have no idea what your life will be like tomorrow. 8 You are a puff of smoke that appears briefly and then disappears.      15          Instead you should say, "If the Lord wills it, 9 we shall live to do this or that."      16          But now you are boasting in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.      17          So for one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, it is a sin. 10       http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/james/jam...|`|AA11586837	Hello!  Yes!

He did not create us with a knowledge of which religion was right because He wants us to figure it out for ourselves. Free will was the only way to do that.|`|iNn9mmOtaa	Of Them/Us, male and female them are both created + destroyed.  Of Created/Made, us are made, from better one of them vs them.

Each Soul is an aspect of God, a projection of God, and the purpose for our being is to discover who and what we are.  God is Neutral Spiritual Energy, and thus everything and nothing depending upon how one views Reality?    The MIND which each Soul has attached to it to enable it to experience Life, is composed of both Yang and Yin natures.  Yang being the out-going nature and Yin the in-going nature.      In Eastern mysticism it is known that the ruler of the three lower planes of Creation is Kal, and Kal is also known as the "negative power", or what Christians call Satan.  The role of Kal is to insure, via the Law of Karma, that each Soul completely explore and experience the whole of Creation.  For every action there is a need to experience its opposite, and we are all doing just that.    The Soul is Neutral Spiritual Energy, an Absolute Energy of Love, Truth and Reality.  But being "Neutral" the Soul cannot know what it can be without experiencing itself in the illusion of life Created by God for that purpose.  Far from leaving the Soul short, God provided everything the Soul needs to ultimately become one with its Creator by Spiritual Evolution won by completing Karma and discovering Knowledge.    Belief in God automatically is awakened within one when one reaches that rung of the ladder of Life where it is appropriate.  Those who do not believe in God are merely perched on the lower rungs of Life.    It isn't easy to accept that one is both Real and illusion at the same time, and only those who have "earned" sufficient Knowledge will be able to Love God and play in the illusion at the same time.

But, instead of turning perfect, they turned sinful. Humans can no more be perfect until/if you get to Heaven. A lot of people don't believe, because God gave them free will. It's their choice whether to believe in God or not. He did create us believing, its our choice whether to or not.|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	It's because we have free will to choose God or ourselves. Most people spend most of thier life telling themselves God does not exist but it doesn't matter if we say God exist or not. God does. You see God created the universe and everything for us. He made us so we could have a relationship with him. To choose God or ourselves. God is good. So to choose between good and evil, evil must exist. Once we choose God it is true love. By saying why didn't God make us the ways you are implying, is saying why didn't God make us with out freewill, not to be like robots. God's wants us to choose. plus some people say thier is not ENOUGH "evidence" or "proof" but there is God's word. You need faith first to accept God, not blind faith. For if you seek God with all your heart to prove to YOURSELF God is real God will reveal himself to you.

AA10948829	Muzukashii not musukashii.  But, yes, you're correct. Kashira is another form of it that's only used by women.  Kana adds a more casual tone to the sentence. Deshou ka would be more formal (and gender-neutral).    It means exactly that. Wa is added at the end of sentences by girls (or prissy older women, IMO).  It has absolutely no meaning without context. It just doesn't translate in English. It kind of helps to soften a person's opinion while, at the same time, sounding girly. It's pretty casual.

In modern-day parlance, the term is also used to describe something blessed with princesses, as in "fairy tale ending" (a happy ending) or "fairy tale romance", though not all fairy tales end happily. Colloquially, a "fairy tale" or "fairy story" can also mean any far-fetched story. Fairy tales mostly attract young children since they easily understand the archetypal characters in the story.    In cultures where demons and witches are perceived as real, fairy tales may merge into legendary narratives, where the context is perceived by teller and hearers as having historical actuality. However, unlike legends and epics they usually do not contain more than superficial references to religion and actual places, persons, and events; they take place once upon a time rather than in actual times.    Fairy tales are found in oral folktales and in literary form. The history of the fairy tale is particularly difficult to trace, because only the literary forms can survive. Still, the evidence of literary works at least indicates that fairy tales have existed for thousands of years, although not perhaps recognized as a genre; the name "fairy tale" was first ascribed to them by Madame d'Aulnoy. Literary fairy tales are found over the centuries all over the world, and when they collected them, folklorists found fairy tales in every culture. Fairy tales, and works derived from fairy tales, are still written today.    The older fairy tales were intended for an audience of adults as well as children, but they were associated with children as early as the writings of the prcieuses; the Brothers Grimm titled their collection Children's and Household Tales, and the link with children has only grown stronger with time.    Folklorists have classified fairy tales in various ways. Among the most notable are the are the Aarne-Thompson classification system and the morphological analysis of Vladimir Propp. Other folklorists have interpreted the tales' significance, but no school has been definitively established for the meaning of the tales.|`|SmORYceJaa	cant really help or thing of a dinosaur raped in toilet paper

This is usually answered in one of two ways:  1) The god's came from nothing  2) The god's always existed    If the god's came from nothing, why not skip a step and say the universe came from nothing?    If the god's always existed, why not skip a step and say the universe always existed?    It becomes clear that adding gods into the equation doesn't explain anything, and leaves you with the exact same questions you had before.|`|iOvHmpnbaa	"what is it that makes you think that there is no Easter Bunny?"|`|vNtgnag5aa	Certian verses in the bible just scream "A PERSON WROTE THIS TO PUT THEIR OWN OPINION IN THE BIBLE" that really contradict what they say God is like.|`|WTXRW0ASaa	You can't prove God exists. You can't prove God doesn't exists.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Absence of proof indicates proof of absence.  There are many reasons, here are a few:    Since every 'god' imagined is claimed to have powers that do not conform to natural laws and is not bound by natural law, it can be concluded that such an entity can not affect anything in the Universe, and as such, can be dismissed outright.  The fact that 99.9% of people worship the same god as their parents. Since your religion is determined by where you were born, when you were born, and to whom you were born, it is obvious that religious belief is the result of indoctrination and not based on anything real. If you were born in ancient Greece, you would never have heard of Jesus and you would be worshiping the Greek gods.  Not one iota of empirical evidence of ANY god has ever been found.  Every 'holy book' from which the concept of a deity is derived contains impossibilities, contradictions, and scientific and historical fallacies.  No 'holy book' demonstrates any knowledge other than that which would have been available at the time of it's writing.  Though there have been thousands of god's worshiped throughout history, no group of followers has ever been observed to derive any benefit for such belief. Since religions are mutually exclusive, if one god were real, you would expect to see a discernible effect on the followers of a 'real' deity.  An omniscient, omnipotent being is logically impossible.  Every event that has been claimed to be 'divine' or supernatural can be easily explained by the natural laws of the Universe.

A magic man in the sky who decides all things for all people, except when human "free will" is involved.  Not one shred of real evidence has ever been found that substantiates the god claim.  The idea that there is this all knowing, all forgiving being, that will however, send you to "hell" if you don't believe in him/her/it. This is the same god that must give us disease, war, poverty, rape, racism, etc.   I'm amazed that anyone in this day and age that has even completed high school could believe in such an outlandish concept.|`|1djmHio4aa	I don't think, I know.|`|B7jMO8iTaa	I guess it is just what you believe (i believe) but the bible is evidence, but there are arguments towards that. i have an argument to everyone of those answers!! the one i could argue the most with is "it just sounds to absurd" this is my starting argument:: and you don't think that the whole world coming from a ball the size of a pin point that just exploded and that people were made from monkeys sounds absurd!?!?|`|oeeT4Zlqaa	A lot of non-believers will generally say there is no evidence. That's a very played out and overrated excuse not to believe but whatever.|`|dKxJ2zDbaa	In my culture we believe in many gods, that is that there is something divine in every thing. It seems to me that it is easier to believe in many gods than to believe in only one or in none for that matter. Our gods are not perfect so that we can look at them and see parts of ourselves in them.Our gods love, have sex, fight between themselves...like us. They do not give orders they do not punish, they are not lording over us. We believe in Karma so there is no system of rewards and punishments independent of our own choices and dictated from above. I am not saying that our beliefs are better than yours or than anyone else's. It is ours. Not better nor worse. It is ours. Many people have told me nasty things about our beliefs. I never could imagine myself telling you that your religion or lack of is stupid. I have had many questions about religions in Occident and I know I don't understand them very well. I am learning. Radhika.|`|Qp821NRyaa	On matter of religious beliefs (or unbeliefs) I personnally think that black and white answers do not satisfy me. I never go to church but I have studied the Bible - and yes I have read it all - as well as many other religious texts from other faiths. That probably is more than many on this forum.I never pray but I believe in spirituality and meditate on a regular basis. I often have deep conversations with many of my friends on religious topics. Yet I am an unbeliever that is uncommited to any belief systems or any church. But I never laugh at believers and why should I?     I like what Radhika says and I very often agree with her since I have her as a contact and like to read her answers on different topics. And we often write each other. She is culturally an Hindu but she also is a scientist. Her gods and goddesses are her way to see a deeper aspect to all there is. In a sense I see her as a poet.     Both of us as many others among my friends are very active bisexual. I say that because I find that many people were turned off religion because of religions' stand on sexuality and they appear to become all the more atheist that they perceive gods as against sex. Black and white answer.     Like Radhika I too am a scientist as well as a business woman. In my case I own a chemical factory. I have many friends and many lovers as well. But life is not all sex and fun.    I tend to avoid shallow people, that is people without any spirituality, people who are not interested by any kind of philosophical or theological inquiries. Answers like I don't believe in god because I have never seen him sounds to me like I don't like Shakespeare because I have never read him. To accept god as well as to dispose of him needs thinking.|`|RrnMRJ2Laa	GOD IS REAL HE ANSWERED MY PRAYER!!|`|TLLklriUaa	The same reason you dismiss the thousands of other gods.

AA11784965	I don't think it's UNDER Mount Ararat. I believe pieces of it exist ON Mt. Ararat, wherever that may be. Because the one mountain that they study for answers is not necissarily the correct Mt. Ararat. But it's there & if God wants us to find it we will. If not, we will just have to take it on FAITH.|`|AA10354187	I don't, because Noah's Ark never existed literally. That story belongs to the mythical parts of the Bible, just like Adam and Eve. There's a moral teaching but no historical fact.|`|evStsOQiaa	Yes there has to be some of its' remains still up there that will be found when the time is right for God to let us find it. Here is my reason why and will be blunt to save space. The top of Mt. Ararat was frozen and snow covered before Noah's flood. As the world wide flood started and the sea level rose it not only raised the ark up but also the atmosphere around the Earth. When the sea level rose to cover the tops of the mountains around the world the air and water temperature also increased and caused the ice covered mountains to melt during the year Noah and the ark were floating. When the sea level started to drop and the tops of the mountains started to reappear Noah's ark came to ground itself on the top of Mt. Ararat.  Noah, his family and the animals would then live at the top of Ararat using the ark for shelter and for fire wood. But as the sea level continued to slowly drop  Noah, his family and the animals would be forced to follow the sea level back down the mountain abandoning what was left of the ark at the top. The tops of the mountains around the Earth including Ararat would then start to refreeze over with ice and snow as the atmosphere also followed the sea level back down thus covering what remains of the ark under tons of ice and snow for many generations to come.|`|PM23RDycaa	Nope because the ark did not exist.|`|dFrMhJxUaa	nope, satellite's proves it is not there.|`|j0oU4V3baa	It's a fairy tale, brah.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Under the mountain? How would it be under the mountain?|`|AIZvfgscaa	Yes I believe that Noah's Ark is under the glazier of Mount Ararat, which is a range of mountains, not just one. Some years ago I meet the archaeologist who sought permission to excavate there, but the Turkish Government refused. He did manage to 'scan' the area and discovered that there were compartments under the glazier, his team also found some food fodder. The area was first discover by a Russian spy plane which flew over and took pictures, it was noticed that the glazier had a clear shape in it of a boat, lager than the biggest battle ship we currently have. He, along with his team were kidnapped by some mountain bandits and later released for a couple of trucks,  our church prayed for him and his team at that time.

Hazing:  causing pledges to do nasty and sometimes dangerous or embarassing things by telling them they must or they won't be accepted into the sorority.    Pledges...newbies who are peldging their souls to the sorority...souls or time, or futures...however you want to term it, they are making a promise (as of conflict night) to become a permanent, lifetime member of your sisterhood.    pledging, the act of participating in the time when one is making that commitment, and doing things, such as hazing, in order to become a full sister.    Sorority - literally sisterhood.  It's a club, usually at the university level, of women, who consider themselves to be sisters, and often live in the same house, and spend a great deal of their non class time together in social pursuits.  Most sororities have greek letters (two or three) as their names, and the letters generally are completely arbitrary. There are secrets, and secret handshakes, mottos, crests, etc., in almost every sorority.    Some are service communities, and some are honors societies, but the vast majority are social clubs, and involve a great deal of partying and drinking.

(I know I've said I'm 14 before, but I'm just about to turn 14 so I rounded up).    I'm not obsessed but I like Twilight.  It's good.    Why did you put so many question marks and exclamation points?  Kind of annoying.    DaeO, Bella is supposed to be pretty much a plain-Jane, and yet Edward finds her beautiful the way she is.  Like when she becomes a vampire, she says "Well, at least I'm pretty."  And he says "Bella, you've never been merely pretty."  But everybody else sees her as plain (except Mike).  Isn't that sweet?  He loves her for who she is and finds beauty in less obvious places and loves her the way she is.  Like you might see a rundown old house but I see its true beauty.  And, uh, last time I checked, Bella made the conscious decision to raise Renesmee.  Now everybody's allowed to have opinions, but you just sound like you're jealous you didn't come up with it first.|`|MRlJgANsaa	cause it's amazing!!!!  i'm not obsessed but i like it.|`|48AxT51Aaa	I have no idea.  I'm not interested enough in the basic plot to even read the book.  It's just a fad, I suppose.|`|7iEk06aDaa	Because vampires are romantic and attract women and young girls. Hollywood taught us that. They romanticized the idea of vampirism and getting bit, and being with someone forever.

It can distract you from other, more productive things, like building homes with Habitat for Humanity, but there is some programming that is very beneficial. PBS I think is a fine network, and History and Discovery have their merits too.

Being gay means being sexually attracted to the same sex. You can be gay even if you never have sex.

If he ISN'T gay then I'm a God-fearing Catholic in line for sainthood. Tell your Uncle Mary the jig is up.    The act of sex itself has nothing to do with one's orientation. You could be gay but never have sex.

AA11440601	No.    One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world.    These predictions are scare tactics, conspiracy theories, and chances to make money from books and movies.    Ever since the Y2K and 6/6/6 (June 6, 2006) End of the World scenarios did not pan out, the scare mongers, conspiracy theorists, book sellers, and television executives have been touting the 2012 End of the World scenario. When 2012 does not happen either, I am sure they will think of something else.    "But of that day or hour, no one knows, neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be watchful! Be alert! You do not know when the time will come." (Mark 13:32-33)    Jesus told us in no uncertain terms that we were not to know when the end of the world would come but that we were always to be ready.    The early Christian Church thought that Jesus was going to return at any moment. Only after a couple of centuries did the Church realize that it may be 2,000 or 4,000 or 8,000 years before Jesus returns.    The Catholic Church wisely follows Jesus' advice and teaches that each of us should live as if we will meet our maker in the next ten minutes and that we need to work to make the world a better place for our 100 X great-grandchildren.    Do not worry about the end of the world. Trust God to make sure everything happens to plan. Just be ready to meet God at any time.

All that really happened was their calendar ended, much like how a paper calendar ends every year and you have to replace it. This just means they never updated the calendar any further ahead, and we can probably blame the Spaniards for that.|`|AA10556726	No, I truly believe the rumors and hype are extremely silly.|`|ARBdyEwlaa	Nope. I don't belive.  It's because the ancient Mayans created a calendar millions of years ago depicting what will happen in the future, and everything they wrote on the calendar is correct. They predicted everything that has happened! The calendar stops at December 21st, 2012, so people's guesses are that the world is ending then.    In the Bible, it suggests that no one will know the date when it happens and no one will think about the world ending the day it does. I doubt it will happen though :) Youve got nothin to worry about!|`|LLey4VRzaa	I believe it as much as I believe in the Jehovah witness Prophecy that Jesus is coming back in 1975.|`|X1jupF0paa	Along with the predictions of Nostradamus and the Mayan calendar, I've also heard that calculate it will be the date that the earth passes through the center of the universe.

iNkawzvMaa	Very good question.  I guess it depends on if it is in personal interaction or if it is on a larger scale.  Racism is a form of bigotry, prejudice, stereotyping, and/or discrimination that covers a number of areas of society, so it really depends on the situation.  The best answers in this instance that I can give are general examples.    If you are black person and all of a sudden you meet a white person which can't stand you because you're black or just says stupid naive garbage obviously because you're different in this way and doesnt know you, it depends on the type or strength.  If its like hardcore white supremacy, for your own sake, I dont think youd want to be around, yknow?    In my opinion the best way of fighting it is through education.  Now any form of bigotry, prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination generally might come in one of two different forms.  Either through hate or disgust of someone different, or through just simply naivete.  In either circumstance, education is the key.    Think about, if you are a black person and they are educated about your race more, then they have no good reason to hate you because they know better.    Some common things that might happen are like maybe some white guy may have some black co-workers who cant be difficult to work with and after working with them for a while the association between black people and whatever his problem with those he works with are, become his perception of them as a whole, making it difficult for him to be any others out of either digust, fear, or whatever else he drew.    How would you solve that?  Get him around some black folks who are very good and likable people repeatedly.  That would wear off his perceptions a little bit about them and realize that every race has its good and its bad, not just its bad.    Television, movies, and the rest of the media dont help matters.  Television and film, even in our modern day and shown in its worst, manage to stereotype black folks as being hostile, violent, criminal, irresponsible, lazy, drug-addicted, not good parents (baby daddy stuff) loudmouthed, completely in-yo-face, and overall completely classless.  I know firsthand its not true for them all.  This would include IMO, turning off the daytime Maury Povich, Ricky Lake, or Jerry Springer type of trash talk shows with their whos the baby daddy typical topic or the VH1 celebreality shows like Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, I Love New York, etc.  It features massive amounts of racial stereotyping.  This stuff needs to be taken off the air completely.    I hope this helped.  Sorry for the long post, but racism is a big overall thing that spreads in a number of different ways.  Kind of hard for me to really simplify.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	when youre exposed to it ..confront the people and tell them its offensive ..even to you.|`|AA11482835	Look at Martin Luther King Jr.'s tactics.

LPO8RlVdaa	Yes, Sheri P got it pretty much right. The Iraqi people basically ran riot after the fall of Saddam, and the museum was seen as fair game. Pretty much everything that was taken has now been returned, but unfortunately a lot was destroyed beyond repair or replacement. Irreplaceable treasures lost forever because of the backward mentality of the Iraqi's.|`|2uPEty21aa	Some but not many, most "disappeared" to various museums years ago.|`|AA11966816	Things go missing in wartime - ask the Jews who survived WW2 !|`|wXDfW7Bcaa	As the previous answer says, there was a considerable amount of argument about this at the time. Baghdad Museum was broken into, and early reports stated that thousands of items were taken. However, later reports said that this was a mistake. Apparently a member of ther museum staff was asked how many items were IN the museum, and gave that number, which was then incorrectly reported as the number that had been stolen.  Undoubtedly many artefacts were taken and/or broken at the time, and there was a fair amount of looting. However, the war was not exactly unexpected, and the vast majority of the important/valuable items were stored in bank vaults before this. Also, many of the items that were taken were later returned - significant ones would have been difficult to sell as there was so much international outcy at the time.  There was also an amusing tale that I came across that the thieves broke into one room which housed many small but valuable items, but burnt some of the foam used for packing to give them light, and were overcome by the fumes and had to leave!  Incidentally, one of the worst things about it was that room, which was locked and only accessible by a few staff, but it was found that the door was unlocked by the thieves, not broken, which caused a huge outcry about a staff member being involved - I dont know the outcome of this.    However, one of the worst things about the war (from a heritage perspective that is) is the destruction of archaeological sites outside of the museum. The whole of Mesopotamia is hugely important in this way as it is currently believed to be where 'civilisation' started (farming, settlers, etc.). Most of these cultures built using mud bricks, which were often levelled and built on top of when they needed repairing. This caused them to become built up above the surrounding landscape, and erosion and deposition over the years have caused them to now simply resemble hills.  In fact, Mesopotamia has no natural hills, so the army is using these sites as cover, and many of them are being destroyed. This is a huge blow to archaeologists, as it will hugely impede our understanding not only of the early cultures in this area, but of our own cultures and how they developed from this area.    Sorry thats a bit longer than planned - hope some of its useful though!|`|ccccc3a7fff67561896e1cd6e04c515faa	Yes and yes. I remember a story in particular of an ancient Mesopotamian vase that was stolen, and returned: but it had been whole when it was taken, whereas it was a bag of shards when they took it back. A similar even happened with the famous Warka Vase: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warka_Vase  Other items stolen and recovered include the Mask of Warka and the Bassetki Statue.|`|t8f3uvr5aa	the guy who replied to this blog reckons so -http://sarsen56.wordpress.com/solve-this...|`|9BeUbORtaa	There has been a surprising amount of argument about this. Apologists for the invasion have attempted to argue that the missing artifacts were in fact sold or stolen decades ago during the Saddam regime. This now seems incorrect. Most of the missing artifacts were still in the museums of Baghdad in 2002. Several thousand portable museum-pieces - including many cuneiform tablets and seals of Babylonian origin - were stolen during the invasion, under the very noses of American troops (who actually had archaeological experts with their divisions in order to prevent exactly this sort of occurrence). Some artifacts been recovered, including a few of the most significant pieces such as the treasures of Nimrud. But many are still unaccounted for.
oxeAYFGzaa	So young yet so much drama. I feel for you in this as i have to been in some what of the same situation. the best advice i can give you is to talk to the ex-girlfriend and let her know how you feel and be as open and honest as you can be with her. also as much fun as i am sure the FWB is if your not going to be a couple i would stop doing anything of a sexual nature with her. That way your friendship can continue with being friends without the confusion of sex.     I hope everything works out for you.
nwRBiyMFaa	It's a very old reflex which not only we humans have, but also the apes (chimpanzee).  Basically what happens in our brain when we get tickled is, that in very short time, lots of neural impulses get sent out to the body. Our muscles get tense and we start laughing.    It's not completely clear yet, why we have this reflex and what aim it had thousands of years ago.  Darwin believed, that it was a sign of ease and alleviation, after somebody scared us or touched us in a sudden and unexpected way. This way, our body could relax again and lose the energy we prepared for a fight, he thought. Similarly, this is also the reason, why we aren't able to tickle ourselves (because we already know it, before we do it), according to Darwin.  Other scientists also believe, that it could be a reflex of protection.    Modern research with robots have shown, that people aren't able to tickle themselves, even if they only control the joystick of a computer which gives the robot the order to tickle the person.   This would support Darwin's theory... but still, we don't understand this issue fully...|`|p6UtB531aa	Scientists suggest that being ticklish is our defense against creepy crawlies like spiders and bugs, a physiological response alerting us to a specific type of threat. That is why vulnerable parts of our bodies -- feet, chest, and armpits, are among the most ticklish.

3RQkgTSOaa	Yes, I think it is because it's not like we can walk down ANY street freely and openly. Finding partners is relegated to bars, online dating and referrals from friends (there are others I know, but that's beside the point: the world is biased towards str8 coupling and does not advocate same sex relationships.)    We are an unseen social segment partially because (1) we hide because we fear physical retaliation against us and (2) society would prefer to turn a blind eye to our existence. Because we don't want to be seen and society wants to ignore us, it's a little harder finding one another in this big wide world of ours. Mind you, this is a generalization. Obviously where there are larger enclaves of LGBT, like in San Francisco, Provincetown and other gay centers, finding one another is easier.    When you're young, I don't think it matters if you're gay or str8: "infidelity," changing partners and multiple dates are par for the course.

GR2XNzCCaa	Go for good fitting pants (don't have to be skinny jeans), Abercrombie or Hollister shirt or tee shirt, and Vans shoes or flats (if you're feet aren't huge). Its winter so no skirts unless its warm where you live or you have black tights underneath. No heal. That's too much. Don't talk like guys as girls talk on tv (way too falsetto) or walk like you have something in your butt. Music- anything but metal, rap, or screamo (go for top 100). No need to read unless you wanna carry Twilight around everywhere. Any food I guess, but practice some manners. Overall, just do everything else normal. Follow what other girls are doing too. Good luck. Lol|`|Y9DCuWPIaa	Well I can only tell you how I act, maybe it would give you some idea.     1st of all. Wax. Get rid of all that icky hair. You don't need it.   Because I am irish, and pale by default!! I usually apply fake tan before going anywhere important, for dinner, clubbing ect. I use sally hansen, because it is easily applied and easily removed, and doesn't leave a horrid smell.     Broadway fake nails, if you don't feel like leaving out a fortune on gel nails. But, tbh... its kinda nice having someone pamper you, so maybe you'd prefer to get the gel nails.     Please make sure your purse and shoes match. Ballet pumps with jeans. Stilettos with jeans. Stillettos with dresses, but make sure you carry a pair of flats in your purse with you.     Always dress up when heading for dinner/for cocktails. A nice dress, a nice necklace and maybe a bling ring. Don't overdo it with the accessories.     For the gym I usually wear a tight tshirt and sweatpants. And I match my socks with my bra/panties. Most of my gym t's are pastel colours, and I love grey bottoms.     My fave tv shows are desperate housewives, greys anatomy, Home and Away, Prison Break, Eastenders, Emmerdale, Coronation Street. I also love cartoons.     Fave music? Well I am LOVING Rhianna at the moment. Love. I also like Chris Brown, Gigi D'agistino, Tiesto, Kylie, Britney Spears, Beyonce, Paolo Nutini     Fave movies? The notebook, Shrek (1+2, 3 not so much), Save the last dance, Twilight, Legally Blonde, High heels Low lives, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Bridget Jones Diary (1+2),  Little Miss Sunshine, Miss Congenality (1+2), Crossroads, Big Mommas house.     Food to eat? I'm afraid I'm not a "girl" re: food. I love my food. My fave is a thai green chicken curry with boiled rice. I also prefer candy to chocolate. Make sure you get your 5-a-day fruit/veg though. And try drink at least 8 glasses of water each day. It makes your skin look better. I absolutely promise.     Applying make up and fake tan? Make sure you moisturise properly. Make sure your foundation matchs your skin tone. The idea of it isnt to make you look paler, or darker. Its to even out skin tones/imperfections so you look flawless. Smashbox do a nice face primer - photofinish. Apply this under your foundation, and concealer.   I like Benefits concealer, erase paste. Blend the concealer in with the foundation to avoid the owl eye look.   Take it easy with eyeshadow and mascara and dont use lipliner. You will end up looking like a dragqueen.   Subtle is your friend. On nights out, I recommend Benefits high beam. Fantastic. L'oreal or Maybelline for Mascara.     Underwear? Thongs are so ... ugh. Avoid unless you really want to avoid the VPL. I am lovin' french knickers and boyshorts right now.     Weekend fun? A day at the spa. Facials. Massages. DVD nights with jellies and pjamas. And lots of cuddles for your friends too. I hate when people dont hug.    Anyway!

0bOSZIzJaa	Faith is a trust in the unbelievable or impossible.  I consider blind-faith bad faith.|`|AA10471892	To help you understand what faith is, it helps to understand what faith is not.      The law is not of faith: - Galatians 3:12     The purpose of faith is to have your total trust in God, and not to have that faith divided, such as any reliance on your self.     Faith results in love; love for God and fellow man:    For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. - Galatians 5:6    Israel was given the law because they were faithless:    But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. - Galatians 3:23     Adam and Eve's sin was one of faithlessness.  They did not believe God as a result of what the serpent said to them, so they partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that represents the law. The law teaches the knowledge of good and evil, and its fruit is death, seeing all the law could do was condemn the one who transgressed it.    The contrast here is the tree of life that represents Christ. One partakes of that "tree" through faith.  So it boils down to this:  Do you believe what Christ said when He walked the earth in the flesh?  He said:    John 5:24 ?Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.    John 6:35 ?And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.    John 6:40 ?And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.    John 6:47 ?Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.    John 11:25 ?Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:    Those who insist on putting their faith in themselves conclude they have to keep that old covenant law also, thereby showing their unbelief in what Christ has declared.  You cannot save yourself.  You have no active participation in your salvation through your own efforts. You cannot keep the law perfectly, as that law required.      It is a "leap of faith" for those who have been convinced to rely on the law to abandon the law and embrace total faith in Christ.    Believing in Christ is the gospel. Placing all your faith and trust and hope and belief in Christ results in one receiving the Holy Spirit and participation in the nature of God; a nature of love, where you now "fulfill" the law through that love as contrasted to merely "keeping" that law imperfectly based on your own efforts.    No one will boast before God.  No one will ever be able to say, My salvation was enhanced through my own efforts in keeping the law and the sabbath.    May I recommend you print out every passage of Scripture where the word "faith" is found, and study that list?|`|j0oU4V3baa	God people failed at proving God, so they came up with this faith nonsense to continue there religious cult brainwashing.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Quite often faith is believing what you know ain't so.    Example - Look up John 14:14. It says you can have whatever you ask in Jesus' name. Every Christian is required to believe this. It's the word of God. At the same time every Christian knows that he or she cannot really have whatever they ask in Jesus' name. Try it and see. This is just one example of believing what you know ain't so. Religious training conditions people to believe that a thing and its opposite can both be true.|`|NLinPsyhaa	Faith is the hope of things unseen. Many people have more faith than they  care to admit. When people get married, they take it on faith that the person they are committing their lives to will be the same person they were before getting married. When we go to sleep, we have faith there will be a tomorrow. When we flip a light switch, we have faith the electricity will light the bulb.    So it's not that there is bad faith or a lack of it, but who or what we put our faith in.|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	Faith is nothing more than acceptance of another's truthfulness. You can have faith in a person, but not in an object or idea. For those there is belief. I believe the chair at my desk will hold me, but I have no faith in it because it makes no claims about itself. It is an inanimate object. I have faith in God and in my friends because they have shown their trustworthiness.  Changes to the English language, made through constant misuse, have caused confusion for many.  When the disciples asked Jesus to increase thair faith, he did so by telling them a parable. He gave more evidence of his truthfulness. Faith is based upon evidence.|`|eLGDh1Hzaa	2 Peter  Chapter 1    1      1 Symeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have received a faith of equal value to ours through the righteousness of our God and savior Jesus Christ:  2      may grace and peace be yours in abundance through knowledge 2 of God and of Jesus our Lord.  3      3 4 His divine power has bestowed on us everything that makes for life and devotion, through the knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and power.  4      Through these, he has bestowed on us the precious and very great promises, so that through them you may come to share in the divine nature, after escaping from the corruption that is in the world because of evil desire.  5      5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, virtue with knowledge,  6      knowledge with self-control, self-control with endurance, endurance with devotion,  7      devotion with mutual affection, mutual affection with love.  8      If these are yours and increase in abundance, they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  9      Anyone who lacks them is blind and shortsighted, forgetful of the cleansing of his past sins.  10      6 Therefore, brothers, be all the more eager to make your call and election firm, for, in doing so, you will never stumble.  11      For, in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and savior Jesus Christ will be richly provided for you.      http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/2peter/2p...|`|DB9QbZoQaa	Faith is a gift, one ether has it or they do not have it.    The purpose of faith is to allow us to see the unseen. To realize the unrealizable.    Yes, faith is often used improperly.    The Spirit is the Guide, in ones faith.    The only boundaries of faith is that I can not save myself, that is i can not defeat death, i may not fear it but i, in the flesh, will die.  Only God can defeat death.    Only amongst the flesh.|`|dbw210qqaa	Romans 8   1There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.      2For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.      3For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:|`|LJlaHLQdaa	Blending the Law and Gospel       Do we then make void the law of God through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. Rom. 3:31.      We hear so many who are deceived by the enemy constantly claiming, "I am saved"; but . . . they show such contempt of God's rule of righteousness that we know that they . . . know nothing of saving grace. The heart is not in harmony with the law of God, but is at enmity with that law. Thus was the great rebel in heaven. Will the Lord take men and women to heaven who have no respect for the law of His universe? .     What is to bring the sinner to the knowledge of his sins unless he knows what sin is? The only definition of sin in the Word of God is given us in 1 John 3:4. "Sin is the transgression of the law." The sinner must be made to feel that he is a transgressor. Christ dying upon the cross of Calvary is drawing his attention. Why did Christ die? Because it was the only means for man to be saved. . . . He took upon Himself our sins that He might impute His righteousness to all who believe in Him. . . . The goodness and the love of God lead the sinner to repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. The awakened sinner . . . is pointed to the law he has transgressed. It calls to him to repent, yet there is no saving quality in law to pardon the transgression of law, and his case seems hopeless. But the law draws him to Christ. However deep are his sins of transgression, the blood of Jesus Christ can cleanse him from all sin.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	Faith is just another word for gullible.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	Faith is nothing more than a wishful assumption.

Faith does not have boundaries but the guidelines would be following God's will.  So, faith is what we call doing as God commands.  If he says go you go so on and so forth.  So, when God tells you to tell a mountain to jump in a lake and believe it will happen.  If you finish the verse Jesus says that in the end you will say "We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty."  So faith is doing your job.  This is found in Luke 17|`|IYBTmH26aa	http://www.thercg.org/books/wirf.html|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Faith is believing something that isn't true.  There is no such thing as a law of faith.

The same way that if they speak to a Black person from Africa they will realize he wasn't born here. That is why you shouldn't make assumptions about anyone without even bothering to speak to them. So far nobody who knows me has ever thought I wasn't American.    To those who say Asians haven't been in America long you should do your research. They have been here since the 17th century. Chinese were a big part of the old west and they were discriminated against too. Who do you think built most of the railroads back then?|`|StRaKUf6aa	I've always seen it as the other way around.  As the "model minority" I would find that Asians are much more accepted than blacks are.    However, judging by your details, you meant something else.  I think that blacks are accepted as Americans because blacks have been in America for a lot longer than East Asians, so we've integrated more.  Also, as immigrants, it's much easier for Asians to point back to where they came from.  As for blacks, we can't normally say we're "Nigerian" or "Senegalese" because most of us simply don't know.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	your assumption is wrong|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Where do you live?  I'm from NYC where there' s a plethora of cultures, so I just assume that everyone's American.  You probably think the way you think because you don't live around a lot of Asians.|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Do you mean that Asians are not accepted as Americans, or that black people are not accepted as Asians?|`|jdKTs3aHaa	everyone here is accepted as an American o.o|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Well, white and black people were the only ones here from the beginning of this countries creation in large numbers. So, black people have spent centuries trying to be regarded as Americans but most Asians have came to the U.S. pretty recently. Even though there were many here from the 1800's working on the Railroads.
24H5tznkaa	The Divine is everywhere. When I was reading your question it reminded me of a book called Mists of Avalon. One of the characters in it (I think it was Morgaine) bowed her head in prayer with everyone else in the church but she was secretly communing with the Goddess.    I think that all these hang ups that we have about who the creator is, is our issue and ours alone. I believe that the true nature of the creator is Universal, like you say. It's my opinion that all God's are One and that we only have a small individual view of the Universal truth.|`|U24VtSlZaa	sure you *can*.  you can do whatever you want do to, regardless of how it affects anybody else around you.  And if you have no respect for others, that's how you will live your life.|`|QVKWVValaa	Why not skip the place of worship all together and pray in your heart while standing on a bus, sitting in class/at work or at home watching TV? If you wish to have God in your heart, why does it matter where you are? Just worship and enjoy your connection to God unmediated by surrounding and uninterrupted by anyone else?  That said, if - as many Christians believe - there is only one God all houses of worship, no matter how they appear on the outside or inside, are all devoted to the one God. Praying in any of them should be fine. Just do it quietly to avoid others hearing and calling you a blasphemer (or worse).|`|jOR3cPTXaa	First of all you need to find the True Religion! Jesus said there a many roads leading to God but only one true one. God in bible times did not accept the form or worship of everyone, also he did not listen or answer the prayers of the many religions, even he said he closed his ears and would not listen to his own people the israelites because the were blood guilty and committing fornication.  Ask yourself does your religion teach the truth? Does your religion teach about the paradise earth which God has promised soon to be fullfulled? John 17:3 says This means everlasting life there taking in Knowledge of you the only True God and the one you sent forth Jesus christ. Taking in knowledge is knowing the truth about God and is son, What is Gods name? Mathew 6 the lords prayer says let your name be sanctified, that means make his name known? what is Gods name Jehovah creator of heaven and earth. When we say God in our prayers you could be praying to the God of this System which is satan, 1 john 5:19 proves that, so by using the divine name Jehovah we are speaking to God Jehovah alone.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	I believe that you can worship Jehovah anywhere.    However, I would not attempt to worship him in a church for instance because the scriptures clearly say that idols used in worship are unacceptable to him. There are statues in most places of worship & the bible clearly shows this is unacceptable to God  Exodus 20:4, & 5    You may say.. well does it matter how we worship God or what we use etc.?  I believe that it does matter. In christianity alone there are many different religious nominations & they all claim to follow Jesus.   Are they all worshipping ok?  Is all their worship acceptable to God?    The bible states at Matthew 7:21-23 (Jesus words)  "Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity." (King James Version)    Notice that many will claim to follow Jesus but then he tells them to get away from him as they're unacceptable    So, how we worship really does matter|`|WElddF4uaa	Hi,   I am a buddhist and yes I would enter another holy place outwith my practition   -  this would not ex-communicate me from my practise  in dharma whatsoever.

Only MY God is the right one."    I could go to any church/synagog/temple.  I wouldn't be excommunicated unless I renounced the Church or espoused some heresy.|`|IqtzkgyBaa	YES U ARE RIGHT ! but we first have to be grounded in our believe by accurate studies of GOD wisdom meaning of words, then we can connect with others , base on revelation or DIVINE TRUTH.    The HOLY QURAN AND BIBLE SAYS ALLAH(GOD) created heavens with truth, we have to respect truth whever we go , because the truth gets us closer to GOD, the right truth.    IN HOLY QURAN say ALLAH IS AUTHOR OF BIBLE AND QURAN and Sacred Books around world. This very true and also say we raise prophets or messager to  EVERY NATION, look at the word every. That means GOD is UNIVERSAL.    The Honorable Elijah Muhammad through Honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us that there is no birth record to Islam; Islam is older than the Sun, Moon and Stars.     Islam did not originate with Prophet Muhammad of Arabia, nearly fourteen hundred (1300) years ago (Peace Be Upon Him). Islam did not originate with the Holy Qur'an. I slam did not originate with the teachings of Moses or the teachings of Abraham. Islam was before Abraham. Islam was before the Sun, Moon and Stars. What is Islam? I slam is the Nature of God Himself.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	I think all religions have similar sources/roots.

Especially when you present your argument.|`|f10424ac1ac7b1791b4f665094823d61aa	You are completely right.  God is always the same, it is just the choice of humankind to make different religions with set rules that have to be adhered too.     It is the same God that everyone is praying to.    In Islam the men and women have to pray separately.  I'm sure you'd be welcome in the women's section, but it would be breaching one of their religious tenets if you tried to pray in the men's part of the mosque.

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.     John 7:17    If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.     John 17:3    And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.     Acts 7:55-6    But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.                2 Tim. 1:7- 8   7 For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of clove, and of a sound mind.           8 Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;    1 Corinthians 15:40-2    There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:     1 Corinthians 10:13    There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.       James 1:5-6    If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.     James 2:17-8    Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.

Revelation 20:12-3    And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.

lbt89sEgaa	Perhaps, it depends on your family I suppose. I remember before I came out we were discussing the news when there was all that hoo-ha about gay adoption being allowed, and I accidentally described gay couples as 'us' and not 'them'! I was convinced that was it, but they apparently had no idea.    People miss a surprising amount, especially when it's something you're strongly attuned to.    You shouldn't worry about it, and good on you for confronting your sister's homophobic comments. I should add that she probably wasn't thinking, and I'm sure your understanding is good, but you should be proud of having the bravery to defend your opinions and beliefs despite feeling threatened and isolated in doing so. Most people don't have that kind of strength.    So in short, if you're family are anything like mine then I don't think they would have cottoned on. If they ask about your reaction you could always say a friend of yours came out to you recently and you can see the effects of homophobic attitudes through them.|`|ydDP3VRQaa	Sent her gay porn on the internet!!!!|`|lVxhiMopaa	Hm they may be a little suspicious, but then again I'd get mad if someone was bashing' on a t.v show I was watching, If you want to hide it just say you think the dude is funny.

If she starts questioning you about it and you don't want her to know, just tell her you don't agree with her views. There are a lot of heterosexuals who don't tolerate homophobia. If she's on a need to know basis, maybe she just doesn't need to know and you can leave it at that.

We just had the same problems when I was thirteen. By the way, I started at 11. lol. Well, I thought of the same thing too. I was guilty smiling at people like everything is alright and I feel disgusted about myself knowing that I'm someone really really sinful. I keep on denying it to people that I do maturbate and all their advices were, just to do it. But I believed in God and I knew it was a sin.   But Bro, it's really sad to think about this, but the truth is, once you already started, and trust me with this one, you will never be able to stop. And I knew what I'm saying, because i've been there, and i didn't last. I know that you might be thinking, "Well, I have God, and with God, nothing is impossible, so it wouldn't be impossible for me to change. This guy (which is me) just didn't have that strong faith.) I did! And I'm telling you that I've been in your place. And the most important fact that I'm going to tell you is, every single guy who have hit the puberty are doing the same thing as you do. And trust me, even your own pastor does. Trust me with this one. I know. even your own dad and your brothers does. Even your friends. I wouldn't tell you that it's not a sin because I don't really know. But I do want to tell you that you don't have to worry about your name being erased in the book of life just because of that. You're still in the good side. By the way, God allows a married couple to have sex. And I'm pretty sure that God allows all the guys not to suffer fighting what's natural.

Now lets think back - When a person has the urge to pleasure him or herself usually it's because they are thinking of impure thoughts such as sex. Now masturbation seems innocent because you performing it by yourself; You are not having others pleasure you. The act of sin draws in because you are feeding your body much wanted desire. Your body loves anythings that makes it feel relaxed and free so much that it desires more and more and more to the point that it can become almost as a desire that may compell you to seek pleasure though watching porn or even can lead you to the desire to have premarital sex. This sin starts from the beguinning and last for the rest of your life. I will explain this to you in a line of Christianity. My mother is a Christian... I'm not just a clueless Muslim.

AND He is waiting for YOU to LISTEN!  to the (HIS) Spirit that He has placed within your Heart for this purpose and this purpose only unto you & HIM.  Every human being ever born has a PRIVATE  LINE  straight to the Creator!  Some use it Some don't.  Imagine that!  A final answer 4 U at this time is "Find your Quiet Room in Private with HIM and you will Find your ANSWERS!   When your dream-life when at resting does not fulfill your needs, then, let your physical abilities take control of these needs and set you at peace with yourself.   Tachekahela Honto Yo = translated from American Sioux= Love U as Friend go Forward and Be.      U need now to find your Spirit and speak to it .  Listen to your Elders that Know the Spirit and that will talk /listen to you Honestly, 1 on 1  Sometimes they are hard to find, these Elders.  p.s. U would not have this ? of life if U would've been born in Sweden/Norway/Finland.  This country of the USA has the most documented sexual hang-ups of all countries combined!  Check out the statistics, please.   Y ? because we were founded on a Puritanical belief (dogma)that SEX is dirty and should not be spoken of in public OR private. Just done for pro-genity?  HUH WHAT DUH  Scriptures denote for us to " Go forth and Plenish the World"  P.S.S. The Asian Culture speaks that " Man should Know thy Tail before Thy Head" in Moderation.  Understand the word (moderation) in the dictionary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... R now experiencing PUBERTY it is natural it is O.K.  A prayer at this time has been lifted in your behalf(Wanken-Thanka) that U do not become a Single-Parent statistic,because of some Pretty-boy who fancies your dangles! and has no idea of his responcibility.  Before U let this happen (mating) with the opposite sex; you should date him for many moons(full moons) time enough for U to see thru his Spirit(eyes) and make your decision WITH him, to KNOW him, to BE 1 with him in all ways.and be sure that he is 1) his intentions are Admirable, 2) his actions are Honest for both of you together for always. This is the TRUE Virtue of ALL WOMEN and of ALL (real) MEN!  Very few ever find this today.  this is sad but true for all of us, sometimes.  Test the waters before you Jump.  See that they(he) (is)are ready to take on the burden of child with you. And not leaving you standing at the corner asking others for help in this matter.   Understand? !  Masturbation is Safe/Clean/Honest. It gives you time to think of the future and find your HERO. He who accepts you as you , no matter how you got there.  One day(moment) you will understand this.  Hopefully it will be sooner better than later. Most females grow up many yrs. before males do.  It is natures way.  Some males Never grow up.  Those R the 1's you need to keep at bay.  The one's who will voluntarily WAIT 4 you and your decisions.  The one's that are not only physically, BUT, Mentally & Financially prepared. The one's that have a mind to create a  future and make personal goals in life for the both of you together are the ones that you should be looking for. Not just Big Billy Big Nuts & Biceps!  understand ? ! Look into his eyes! If U can see his Soul/Spirit You will know what to do as woman! Will he let you see what is within his soul.  Is his Spirit in tact!  Woman has the ability to do this naturally.  Some use this , some do not.|`|E7NvlbPBaa	Of course it's wrong. Do you WANT to go to hell? Is googling yourself worth an eternity in hell? Avert your mind from such perversions and focus on pleasing Jesus instead.|`|IW2sLVBgaa	Darling, now is it really safe to post this on the internet where some 30 year old creeps look at questions like these? Along with your age? I would delete this. My opinion only though.|`|u8IUPlECaa	No, it's natural, and everyone does it. It's healthy, and you don't have to go and risk getting pregnant in order to calm your raging hormones. It does not condemn masturbation anywhere in the Bible.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	1. The only immoral actions are those which hurt others.    2. It's not going to ruin your life (unless you post it online or something)    3. Everybody else in church does it, too.|`|kBtc1YBAaa	Masturbation is healthy an normal no matter what religion. You will have MORE of these thoughts if you stop. Look at it this way. Unless you give yourself some physical lovin' you be lookin for someone else to do it for you|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Lol @ masturbating ruining your life.    Listen, you've been lied to and have had the idea of your (completely natural!) sexual thoughts being wrong. They're not.    That goes to show you about Christianity being sexually repressive.|`|29X6EEsKaa	It's not a sin, and bottling up sexual desire is bad. Makes you do stuff like protest in the streets or beat up people, or blow them up. I'm not kidding, it's bad mentally.
X7kKS3Iraa	i know what your going thru, i went thru this around your age aswell, i knew i liked girls before but i felt too much preasure from people around me who made remarks like your too young to know, its just a fase etc. but now im 21 and just as sure about as i was then im just more settled with the thought of it. if i missunderstood you feel free to let me know :)|`|FMuSs9Qtaa	Yes, of course it is, there is a lot of girls feeling the same way|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Its normal we dont choose who we feel attraction for we just feel it|`|pd2GnHnIaa	yes its normal  and theres nothing wrong with your feelings (unless your christian then apparently you'll burn in hell for eternity)  but there lying (i hope O_O)|`|xR68iQA9aa	teenagers have raging hormones anyways.  most people get curious!  its totally natural don't let anybody tell you otherwise!  be proud of who you are!!!  :D|`|NM8xwo22aa	its normal|`|F2EvEWLraa	Nothing it's wrong with you, never think off that, god make you like that, i no a lot off people who use to be my friends, i like their way they think,  there honest people, they dint make you cry like real "men" do, they think better they make you laugh, they're the best friend i ever had, i went to cosmetology, and i have a friend, he use to make me laugh, tried to fix my hair, color my hair, make up, etc, He was my best friend, men i remember that time, he's the best friend ever, i hope he's doing  good, if he read this i will said to him, hi, hello, how you doing, be good, take care. i miss does times.|`|27U5NFcuaa	It is absolutely normal to be gay.Dont let anyone tell you otherwise.Go on and be your gay lovely self :)|`|MuALb7lxaa	Yes, most people who are not straight or straight want to know someone with the same issue to feel comfortable.

mQZDizMVaa	I was the same way: kept to myself, never talked about my personal life and didn't care what others thought. I figured the less coworkers knew about me, the less for them to gossip about.    The things that mattered to me were: get to work on time, get the job done, and get out. Coworkers didn't pay my salary-the state did.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Don't worry about what others say about you, they sound very narrow-minded to me.  Work is about work, not socialisation.|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	I think it's best to keep to yourself.  You're not there to socialize, and I think the same way you do.  I don't have a single thing in common with the people at work other than we work at the same place.  They can think whatever they like, but as long as I'm productive and turn in a good work product, and not outwardly rude, that's all that matters at the end of the day and it's only the opinion of management that matters.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Keep your personal life personal!  That, I think, is the  1 rule of surviving the workplace.   However, if you go to break or lunch with these folk, it's good to develop a little bit of small talk chatter to fit in; or even better, act like you are really listening to them and interested in what they say.  They'll love you.

r0DDXSrJaa	Next time they get to singin', throw George Thorogood's "One Bourbon, One Scotch and One Beer" on the stereo as loud as you can, strip down naked, then dance around on your lawn draped in an American Flag singing along and drinking with the song.  Well, that is what I would do at least...|`|IYF4xSTdaa	sing  indian song when they start in spanish...free will..|`|BN5nW4rZaa	burn a cross in his yard  only kidding people|`|0zieKCK6aa	Racist... thats What you are.. what is the issue ? becuase they were drunk or they were speaking the Language of The Kingdom of Spain?  but i would say if these neighbors of you were illegal immigrants then... i would say if they dont obey the laws while being illegals.. well what do we need em here...

Your family are immigrants, your ancestors are not natives to this country. This country was founded and based upon many cultures and belief's. Our statue of liberty states, gives us your poor,tired and huddled masses. It does not say, just the english speaking ones.     Only a true American understands and accepts other races. A truly Anti-American does not. instead he wants to live in a place like Saudi Arabia where others cannot come and go. of course that would mean that you wouldn't be living here either and would be living somewhere that would make you happier. A place where freedom was never heard of.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Because this is America drunken singing should be tolerated in all languages.|`|5ef81a4a70cec281c1e64cd407d7e84daa	Well You need to booze up and sing louder.

You sound like a really lovely person in a typical school that has its fair share of idiots. You were right to ignore them, don't sink to their level, but if it gets worse make sure you talk to someone, don't suffer in silence.|`|oi7XjTA0aa	yea dude, im just like you. i dont really have anything to say to ppl, theyre always joking in class, i dont "get a kick" from doing that, so i just do my work. yea i would just ignore them, theyll get bored and leave  u alone.|`|iquGhQJpaa	Oh God, ignore them.

Read the following passage.  This is from Moroni chapter 8 in the Book of Mormon   5 For, if I have learned the truth, there have been disputations among you concerning the baptism of your little children.     6 And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for this intent I have written this epistle.     7 For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:     8 Listen to the words of Christ, your Redeemer, your Lord and your God. Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done away in me.     9 And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.     10 Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teachrepentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with their little children.     11 And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.     12 But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism!     13 Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, these must have gone to an endless hell.     14 Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.     15 For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no baptism.     16 Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not what man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.     17 And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and partakers of salvation.     18 For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable from ball eternity to all eternity.     19 Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because of his mercy.     20 And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of him and the power of his redemption.     21 Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an endless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the judgment-seat of Christ.     22 For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	I agree with CJ.  But, christening or dedication is another thing altogether.|`|IIhiSprlaa	They don't. All you get is a baby with a wet head.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	they don't need to    parents just want them to get baptised|`|W1XZ4kAVaa	Because unlike the first answerer it's on the sacrements and also to remove oringal sin|`|k7FD3rt5aa	They don't.  The plan of salvation mentions repentance FIRST.  Can a baby repent??|`|9mLjDa5kaa	"Infant baptism" is false and unbiblical, and it accomplishes nothing with the Lord.    True salvation is only by believing in faith alone in Jesus alone without adding any of your own works.  Water baptism cannot save, water baptism is not required for salvation, and water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's perfect salvation.     Believe in Jesus alone to save you, and you are saved and going to heaven no matter what  :)|`|WZ6YXDODaa	For the "original sin" we are all born with thanks to Adam and Eve|`|vNtgnag5aa	Because some people think that if you arent baptised then you'll go to hell. So if a baby dies the parent wants the comfort of knowing that their child went to heaven. I was baptised 3 times though, when I was 3, 7, and 15.|`|NWnOTkwCaa	1. We are are born in original sin.  2. Baptism is symbolic|`|PcGvS4Xuaa	It's called infant baptism, and it isn't supported by the Bible in the least. It's a man-made tradition, and it's dangerously misleading. People think that if they're sprinkled with water as a baby (not biblical baptism anyway) that they're safe no matter what. NOT true. Jesus is the example... except He managed to live without screwing it all up the way WE do! (Annie smiles with a little glint in her eye)    edit: Okay, the guy two answers above me is kind of ticking me off. Just because the Bible doesn't specifically forbid it doesn't mean it's okay. Also, baptism is NOT what saves you.    While it is symbolic, it's also a public confirmation of your beliefs. A baby doesn't have beliefs, it's a baby. Duh. Since baptism doesn't save you, don't worry about baptizing babies! My church does something called a "parent dedication" when they have babies, it's about the parents publically dedicating themselves to bringing up their children in a Godly manner. Not about the babies. Once again, it's a baby. Duh.    Sheesh, a lot of people are kind of worked up over this, you asked a pretty interesting one, though. Can't blame them.|`|31cc91292d4acf2ddc9a6d449e86868eaa	But Jesus has commanded infant baptism. In Matthew 28:19 He says, "Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit . . .." Before He ascended, the Lord of the Church commanded us to baptize "all nations," a phrase the Church has always understood to mean "everyone." Matthew 25:31-32 also uses the phrase "all nations" in this way. All nations are to be baptized, regardless of race, color, sex, age, class, or education. Jesus makes no exceptions. He doesn't say, "Baptize all nations except . . .." Everyone is to be baptized, including infants. If we say that babies are not to be included in Christ's Great Commission, then where will it stop? What other people will we exclude?|`|XLj8lgEOaa	My mother almost took me to get baptized as an infant, but my dad said no. hahaha.     To answer your question, babies don't NEED to be baptized. The parents WANT their babies to be baptized.|`|3nw2Pwu8aa	rob y p; I am a christian and have not been baptized, I believe in baptism by the spirit rather than water. Water baptism is just an outward expression of something that happens inside of you, so don't make definite statements that aren't true.    As for infant baptism, none of those verses actually say that infants were baptized, just because it doesn't say it didn't happen, doesn't mean it did. Baptism is about repentance and I hardly think an infant has the capacity to comprehend what that's about.    The denomination that I belong to don't practice baptism or communion as practiced by catholics, but we do have equivalents which mean the same thing....any guess as to which church i go to??|`|9XAqnmOQaa	I don't know, why? Yes, I do. It is one of the ploys used to keep people coming to church and, more importantly, giving money.|`|4rWPX8CTaa	So that religious leaders convince people that they have control over everyones life, from start to finish.|`|U24VtSlZaa	In my church, the ceremony of infant baptism is one in which the parents, relatives, and entire congregation pledge to do all we can to help the child.  It's more about the grown-ups than it is the child.    When the child is older, he or she makes a decision whether to accept or reject their earlier Baptism.  It's just how we do it.|`|UO9x4Curaa	Baptism by immersion, I believe, is the only valid Baptism. After all, the very word Baptism, is taken from the Greek word 'baptizo' which means 'to dip'. Why doesn't the Catholic Church Baptize by immersion?    Yes you are right that the Greek word 'baptizo' (also 'baptisma', and 'baptismos' for baptism) means to dip. However, it also means to cleanse by dipping or submerging, to wash, to MAKE CLEAN WITH WATER, to wash ones self, or to bathe. If you wish to use the word 'dip' as the only meaning of baptism, then to 'dip' ones hand or foot in the water would be correct also. Is the purpose of Baptism to clean our bodies by immersion, or to 'make clean' our souls and make them pleasing to GOD, by the removal of original sin?  The Catholic Church does Baptize by immersion when requested, see CCC-1278. Not all Catholic Churches have the facilities to Baptize by immersion, so you might have to go to a Church which does.   Now, why do you ask this? Is it because Jesus Christ was Baptized by immersion? If so, then I will have to say, He was crucified too before He arose into heaven. Does that mean we have to be crucified also before we can enter heaven? Show me in the Bible where every time a Baptism was performed, it was said it was done by immersion? Show me where Jesus Christ was immersed? Scripture says He came up from the water, Matt 2:16, Mark 1:10. It does not say He was immersed. Throughout Scripture it says Baptize with water. Never does it say Baptize immersed in water. Jesus Christ said in John 3:5, "...unless a man be born again of water..." Again He did not say, 'born again Immersed in water'.  John 13:6-10, "He came, then, to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, "Lord do you wash my feet?" (7) Jesus answered and said to him, "What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter." (8) Peter said to Him, "You shall never wash my feet!" Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you shall have no part with Me." (9) Simon Peter said to Him, "LORD, NOT MY FEET ONLY, BUT ALSO MY HANDS AND MY HEAD!" (10) JESUS SAID TO HIM, "HE WHO HAS BATHED NEEDS ONLY TO WASH, AND HE IS CLEAN ALL OVER. And you are clean, but not all.""  Verse 8 makes it clear that Jesus is talking about Baptism. Verse 10 makes it clear that the whole body does not have to be washed to make it clean. It is obvious that He is not talking of a cleansing of the body, but of the soul, thus making baptismal immersion not mandatory.    Go back and read Ezek 36:25 again. The Old Testament "type" of Baptism was by pouring or sprinkling.    T he "Didache" is the teachings of the Apostles. Here is how they performed early Baptisms...    CHAPTER 7:     7:1 But concerning baptism, thus baptize ye: having first recited all these precepts, baptize in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, in running water;     7:2 but if thou hast not running water, baptize in some other water, and if thou canst not baptize in cold, in warm water;     7:3 but if thou hast neither, pour water three times on the head, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.     7:4 But before the baptism, let him who baptizeth and him who is baptized fast previously, and any others who may be able. And thou shalt command him who is baptized to fast one or two days before.     Notice that the Apostles made no mention of "Baptism by Immersion" in this document. The entire "Didache" may be found elsewhere on this website.        --------------------------------------...  The Catholic Church Baptizes infants. Show me the Biblical authority to do this?    Where does it say in Holy Scripture, "Do not Baptize infants"? Show me the Biblical authority NOT to Baptize infants?    Jesus Christ said in Matt 28:19, "GO, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit..."   He did not say adults only did he? Did he ever put an age limit to receive Baptism?     Acts 22:16, "and now WHY DO YOU DELAY? Get up and be Baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name."   So why do you delay in Baptizing your children?     Acts 2:38, But Peter said to them, "Repent and be Baptized every one of you..."   I would say that verse would include everyone, including infants and children of all ages. Peter did not say to leave your infants at home.    Acts 16:15, "And when she and her household had been Baptized..."   Did her household have infants maybe? Did Luke say "everyone in her household except infants"?    Acts 16:33, "And he took them at that very hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he and ALL his family were baptized immediately."  Again, were infants excepted here?     1Cor 1:16, "I Baptized also the household of Stephanas..."   Did Paul say "everyone except infants"?    Luke 3:21, "Now it came to pass when all the people had been baptized..."  Aren't infants part of "all the people"?    For those who deny infant baptism,|`|J7KSKm54aa	Of course Jesus was not really baptized. But the theory is that babies are sinned when they come in and they need their soul cleansed. Beats me what pete crap was getting at- it's his stupid story.|`|b23e3ca87d32dda5732ada9427cb2644aa	What Cj said and those who agree said. It's false teaching traditions of man. Some people try to use the word of God for thier on gain. Read your Bible.|`|Do6NfeACaa	They don't.|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	Infant baptism is about the parents bringing the child before God and asking for guidance to raise the child in the ways of God.  It's really about the parents making a commitment to do the best they can for their child - and asking God's protection over the child until they are old enough to choose for themselves.  It's a choice some parents make -- and in some churches it's a blessing in the name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit....    Hope this helps    : )|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	infant baptism is a tradition developed in the medieval era, because people believed if the baby died it was capable of going to hell. This is not true, because God does not try infants for sins they can't comprehend. True baptism is not necessary either, according to the Bible. It is not a step in the process of becoming saved, you are saved already when you accept Jesus. Baptism is a way that you can proclaim your salvation to the people around you, but many people don't become baptized immediately or even at all sometimes.|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	It is not necessary for a baby to be baptized.|`|z3J5p5lcaa	Because of original sin. The Bible says that entire families were baptized. Families include children and babies.    Everyone is born with a Original Sin|`|y02PZj22aa	The baby might not need it, but it's a custom or tradition in many Christian churches.  The parents submit their infant for baptism as a means of dedicating the child to God, and the congregation affirms that it will make every effort to assist in the Christian upbringing of the child.      In addition, before hospital staffs everywhere started hounding new mothers still woozy from anesthetic for the vital-statistics information that's submitted to the state*, baptismal records were often the "official" record of the birth of a baby and the name given to the child at baptism.  Several of my ancestors were traced by their baptism records, not by any birth certificate.    *Oprah Winfrey has said that her mother meant to name her Orpah, after the daughter-in-law of Naomi from the Hebrew Bible, but the hospital clerk misspelled the name and the rest is history.|`|XTi1x0N0aa	The point of it is definitely NOT forgiveness and mercy. We get forgiven when we are saved and God grants us His mercy.    It is simply an outward showing of an inward conviction. Full stop.    Philip and the Eunuch demonstrates that one must believe first, before being baptised.    Acts 8:36  And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?   Acts 8:37  And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.   Acts 8:38  And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.     Has your Bible got verse 37 in it? If not, throw it away and get yourself a proper Bible that hasn't been tampered with. The authorised King James Bible is God's words for us today.|`|WIvo4eOMaa	Because it is through baptism that our spiritual journey begins, thus it is fitting for a person who is it be raised in the faith to begin life with the sacrament of baptism.|`|kTaa8ejpaa	They don't except in catholic tradition.  An unbaptised baby that dies will go immediately to Christ because of such, the kingdom of heaven is made.    Voluntary baptism, after salvation, as a knowing adult follows the example Jesus Christ set for us.    Babies need to be dedicated to God, just like Christ was.  This dedication is not so much of asking God to watch over the child as the parents/god-parents, grand parents, promising to raise the child in the way he or she should go.      You are responsible for the spiritual lives of your children until they are of age and I am more than a little pissed that a son in law of mine will not take our granddaughter and have her dedicated.  On the other hand, if dad isn't willing to raise her that way then I suppose he shouldn't be a hypocrit and say he will.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	Because god is a forgiving and merciful god, which holds grudges that last forever.
z93tSvKxaa	Of course they do:    1. They create jobs within the penal system.  Since the children of illegal aliens as well as illegal aliens themselves have numbers of incarceration in our jails and prisons.  They also create jobs for law enforcement due to the increase in gang activity, illegal gun trafficking, human trafficking, illegal drugs, and rape, robbery, and littering.    2.  They create jobs for social workers since many illegal aliens and their anchor children collect welfare, foodstamps, as well as medicaid and medicare benefits.    3.  Since they do not speak English they create jobs for bilingual education and bilingual speakers.  Hence creating discrimination against English speaking Americans.     4.  They have a lot of illegitimate babies many which require hundreds of thousands in medical care which creates jobs for more nurses and doctors.     5.  They continue to visit the emergency room hence WITH NO INSURANCE hence creating more healthcare jobs.    6.  They traffic illegal drugs which I guess can be considered a form of self-employment.  However once again they do not pay taxes on profits.      Wellll..... if you consider the above helping then the economy then this is their contribution.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	If someone is illegally in the country but spending the money they make in the local economy and not robbing, killing, stealing or being a nuisance of any sort then id say yes.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	no,but I know where this is going. Not all hispanics are here illegally. Many of them DO speak english and actually want to LEARN english. Many of them are just trying the give their kids the same thing that we have. A better life. I'll take my two points.|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Not that I know of. They are living tax free because they aren't in the system.|`|8RmazUuBaa	absoultely not...    You have to pay the jail them, you have to pay thier welfare and health care...Ilegals cost this country 80 billion a year..|`|LXD5cPszaa	No they cut jobs from people who were already here just because they get paid less.Not that I hate immigrants or anything.Sometimes if I answer the phone I cant understand a word there saying.|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	Nope.  Many of them are sending money back to their families in their country of origin and are therefore taking it out of the economy.    Plus there's the millstone of a burden on healthcare - illegal immigrants aren't turned down for emergency care but there is no way to make them pay for it.  This causes the healthcare costs to raise for those who pay into the system, diverting spending from retail - the lifeblood of economy.    If there were no illegal immigrant workers those employers who relied on cheap immigrants would have to hire citizens, albeit at a higher cost.  Orange juice would sky-rocket in price, but unemployment would dramatically drop, boosting the economy greatly.|`|AA10011095	Everyone performing needed labor "helps the economy" but there are other negative consequences of illegal immigration which outweigh the benefits.|`|VkJLWzwvaa	Not the ones who are on welfare and are allowed to have free health insurance and send their kids to public schools. In fact, I would call that stealing. If I went to Mexico and tried to get away with half the stuff they pull I'd be put in a Mexican prison.|`|GK8Apjdiaa	**** america!!!!!! lol jkjkjkjk im an american citizen but i wasn't a while ago and i think that when i was an illegal immigrant i didn't really do anything to hurt the economy i went to school, i played little league baseball with all the white kids, i spent all my money here in america and i didn't send any back to mexico. i have never recieved free healthcare or welfare or anything of the sort. i learned how to speak english way better than spanish. i didn't rob, steal, kill, or rape anyone.          so **** all the people who say all illegal immigrants are criminals because if you guys were in any of those peoples positions you would have done the same thing. i didn't choose to come to america i was brought over here and if i could have chosen i would have never came in the first place just so i wouldn't have to hear people complaining all the time. dont get me wrong i love being an american but some people just complain way too much.

A simple Christian philosophy, I think - "Love everyone" . . . in other words, show the respect do to each Human Being; after all, we're ALL in this thing called Life, collectively!    And / But as she said, "you don't have to like (or try to be "understanding" [    I'm not suggesting intolerance, only that I personally don't have to like something just because a HUMAN is doing it . . .  I'm free to go the other way, or just ignore it - you do your thing, if that's what you want to do!  As long as it does NOTHING to my personal freedoms or someone elses - do as you like - that's what Freedom (I think) was meant to be.  Thus begins the debate on WHAT is right and wrong, and WHY.    I believe that is why there is SO much controversy on here (R & S) - some are simply simulating a conscience, derived from a book that theyve read (whatever that book may be), and not applying hard and true life experiences to the equation and discussion!|`|ttCkz39aaa	Well there will be more activity in the near future|`|TLLklriUaa	"Are we becoming one big happy disfunctional family?"

YYbVDcw8aa	Actually if I Know something and it is not written down and I do not divulge it, no one else can know it. sometimes you need to earn your knowledge to get the wisdom that goes with it.  I think if a culture wishes to keep their practices among the members it is none of ours mine or any one else's to insist this information be released. That over entitled, colonialistic view is why so many cultures and practices don't exist anymore and why the heart and guts have been torn out of so many cultures and left, lost, purposeless people. maybe I'm wrong.|`|GtazNrplaa	Unfortunately for us of the modern world we have lost the vast knowledge of wisdom that used to be available in written form from ages of old that has been destroyed by Christendom as pagan knowledge. Fortunately there are scraps of it left for us to guess and that most of what is available shines light on the christian mythology for what it is. Just mythology at its best that invented by man for men to rule the world in the name of religion.    The Dead Sea Scrolls have enlighten the world to this fact.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I think if the practices are supposed to be secret, that people can keep them secret if they want to.
7k5xrWq3aa	We have a similar "sleepy hollow" type legend at an old covered bridge near my house. Apparently every halloween you can hear a phantom horse neighing wildly and hoofbeats on the wooden floor of the bridge.     Rumor has it, if you start to run across the bridge, the phantom will race you. Once you've stopped on the other side and you feel a whoosh of wind, that means you've won the race. But if you dont, the phantom has won and you can hear the hoofbeats in the distance.    I've never tried this but two of my friends did and they "claim" it really happened. But who knows? Its still fun.|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	Well it doesn't have much to do with Halloween-even though there are Halloween events there- but I live in Louisville, Kentucky and theres a haunted place called The Waverly Hills Sanatarium. It used to be a hospital for people with taberculosis-dunno if I spelled that right- and so many people died there, that it became haunted. You should google it.|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	In my family we have a "dumb dinner" to honor those who have died in the last year.
mSFjbetxaa	No, not really.    I think the fundies are braindead so I could not care less what they think.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	Yes, several of their repeated expressions get tiresome just because they repeat them so often and thoughtlessly sometimes. It doesn't really bother me very much though and I understand why they say it. To be honest I've thought about it in a way as true. While I did truly believe at one point when I took the time to really examine the claims, the Bible, and my faith and think about it those beliefs and if they made sense they just dissolved away. So in a sense I only believed because it was what I was told as child and the moment I really thought about it I was on the road to not believing it.|`|N8wutNoLaa	There are a lot of Christians who claim to know God.  And there are a lot of Christians who don't know God at all.     ie. Westboro    When you REALLY know God, you SEE who He is and He becomes realler than ever to you, only then do you know who God is.    You would not leave him behind. Trust me.|`|AA11124121	That's one long statement.    The proper response is:    Noone is God. Therefore, noone knows who is saved...before, now, or later.|`|ehmeG65gaa	sort of, I don't know that I was  I mean the freaks hade me down on my knees begging for forgivness at age 7, how could I have been saved at such an impressionable age. I believe that the tears of salvation were more because I was frightened.|`|AA10556726	It really doesn't matter what the Bible asserts, if we believed at one time and now don't, we know that you can indeed reverse your beliefs.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	The more I studied scripture the more I saw the unhealthiness of this religion.  While I am able to hold my own concerning Biblical knowledge with those with Divinity degrees I know that knowledge itself does not necessarily draw people away from faith.  Emotional needs play a large role with the educated believer.  One of the things that started to draw me away from Christianity occurred when I made the decision to live a Christian life in everything that I did.  As situations occurred I looked at scripture for guidance and was horrified at the Biblical responses.  There is very little forgiveness in the Bible.|`|DB9QbZoQaa	Given what "Ex-Christians" claim they once knew (if they exist)  their credibility is in question.    By the way The Jews accusing Jesus knew the word, to be sure, far more extensively than you.    Further isn't it ironic that every anti-christian argument presented, includes accusation?    The Army of Israel said Goliath was to big to hit, King David said Goliath was to big to miss.    Words do not create credibility, actions do.    Get some! (credibility)|`|ki0tOVUYaa	OMG; I had the same experience. By studying theology, the Bible and their development, I eventually studied my way out of it and have a much more accurate understanding than the fundies do. BTW, I know many progressive Christians who are credible scholars and remain within the umbrella; they are worth their salt.  I have also noticed we have a thorough understanding of the psychology of religion. This is evident in the typical choices of responses we get: Well, you may have been saved, but you turned from the faith or You were deceived or You are still saved, because Jesus never let you go, but you are just in a faith crises, because once you know God, you can never turn away  I believed and I did not turn away from my faith when I turned from Christianity; I freed my faith from its clutches and evolved.|`|M4WIWMgBaa	Yup. That old no true Scotsman fallacy gets old.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	blah, blah blah, way too long of a question to bother reading
lBLBvE0Zaa	Most of the people in this section have been around for a long time, so they know each other. Therefore, this section is more a community than anything else, so people tend to ask random things about their personal lives etc.    Also, it's a way to make things funnier around here. It'd be really tiring if all the questions were "Am I gay?" "Does this make me a lesbian?" "Is it a disease to be homosexual?".    Take care.  ;-)|`|KSq8DXlfaa	idk why, but LGBTers seem to give better, more thoughtful answers than other groups. Maybe that's why: if you really want something answered, you post it where you'll get the best answers from people who actually generally care about more than just the points, regardless of whether your question is LGBT related. I'm guilty of having done that a few times:(|`|qvW5ZYruaa	Hypocrisy is a lovely thing.|`|TLOgBy3caa	I do it 'cause I love everyone in this place.

QIQNzE11aa	Friendships are rarely meant to last a life time. So to put all your ideas and thoughts based upon them, is to make for an unhappy adult life.     People are constantly growing and changing, with that friends don't always follow your paths. This is why finding new friends is important.     If you look around you have to make a choice to see the positive side of life or the negative. Both are reality, both are just as prevalent as the other. In fact, i'd say the scales tip far into favor of good people. When you take the time it's easy to see, though most cannot believe it.     I've often been in a group of people where one was an ****. The next thing you know people can focus on nothing else other than how bad that person was and how they allowed that person to ruin their day. Instead of counting every other person in that group who did not act badly.     Teen years are hard, and i think this is what you might be basing your thought process on. Adults often refer to high school years in a negative manner due to the childishness that happens there. Too many people never stop to see the other nice people who would like to be their friends, but instead only want those that they feel are cool. make friends like yourself. Find other nice people and they will want to be you friend. So what if you don't hang out at the cool tables. If you found 3 great friends you'd find peace and happiness. Look in the right places though.     Friends don't ever screw over friends. They weren't friends to begin with, once again, that has to do with the choices you are making. You need to set out and look for the right people to befriend. The ones who aren't aspiring to the big table. If you are not good at reading people and understanding the type of person they are, then don't be quick to make a friendship. Be slightly cautious, not overly so though. Make sure you know who they are and what they stand for before accepting them fully. And even then, don't tell anyone a secret that you dont' want others to know. it's asking too much of others. It only takes one slip. That isn't screwing them over, that's a mistake. the biggest part of the mistake was confiding it in them in the first place. Talk to a church official or a counselor of secrets and no one else. People who cannot tell your secret and are good at keeping secrets.|`|cRhkkBAEaa	I agree with you 100%. 101% actually.     I'm so glad someone agrees with me.     Like, people push past each other in the streets, people dont stand up for old people on the bus anymore, tiny little things like that, which would make a big change.     People shouts rude things at other people who are just walking along minding their own business. They walk along with their friends screaming and shouting.     Oh, I agree entirely :)|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	I agree with you to a certain extent.     A lot of people don't want to do things for others if it doesn't benefit them and it could be worse these days due to the economy.     People are worried about themselves a lot more because money is scarce, homes are being lost, food is outrageous, & jobs are being lost.    It's hard to live and it makes people cranky and less helpful and also less caring.     Or you could be hanging around some real jerks.|`|T1qzML1Zaa	I agree. I think it is because of the way people are raising their kids. When you let your kids say and do whatever they want the only thing they are going to care about is themselves. I use to have a job working around kids all the time and 80% of them were spoiled rotten little brats who didn't listen. They would run around the store yelling and screaming, throwing things, beating on their siblings and mom and dad would just stand there. When you don't teach your kids whats right and whats wrong and MAKE THEM live by what is right and good your just going to end up with selfish asshole adults.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	Old Mister Happy had a very good point.  The world is not too much different to what it was in years past.  The focus has shifted from helping each other and cooperation to get the job done to individualism and me-first.  But the people are all sill the same.  It's just that we see more selfishness because it's the popular thing.  His advice was to move in different circles of people ... you're in University ... Uni is full of tossers and is a huge popularity contest, this may be where you're getting the perception that only the loud people get friends.  Just look for groups of quieter more normal people, and you'll find that there are still some nice and selfless people in the world.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	Wow!    My points ...    1. I use to think the same thing until i stopped hanging out with the bitter folks!  Yes there are a lot of them!  but to be frank there are more nice people then what you stated!  It's all about what you focus on !  if you only focus on the mean peeps then more will show their face!  basic Laws of attraction 101 !!!!       2. you calling out Mr happy -- you state in your question people don't care anymore - Why do you give a toss  ??? Your defending yourself right!  What if (go with me) these people your marking off as mean or rude or whatnot are just defending themself!  or does it matter at that point? He brings up some very good points and just because he pointed out how your didn't use the spell check you jumped on his case!  Look i don't use spell check yet i'm lazy and i don't care about some grammar error .. but two wrongs don't make a right and you calling him out was just as RUDE as he was to point out your mistakes?!       3. my person thoughts and this isn't directed to you so please don't take it personal and attack me but most people who take things personal or are always defending themselves are more selfish then what they even think...  think about that one!     Your smart your at the univeristy so look at life from the rude person shoes and try not to pass so much judgement on them because of whatever sort of day they are having!      Best wishes|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Why do you think it is more than way now than 20 years ago, or 40 years ago.  It isn't.  Been there, done that.  It is the people that YOU are associating with, not the world as a whole.  If you could understand that, you could start to associate with a better class of people.  You may think this is rude, but I think YOU are quite rude and inconsiderate of the rest of us.  Do you know why?  Yahoo Answers built in a check spell device, you ignored using it.  You don't think we deserve capitalization, and proper grammar, either.   And, I bet you'll be the very first to be angry, mean and even more rude because of my feelings about it.      Educate yourself and a high class of people might be interested.

AA10034051	Repentance is the act of changing one's mind. Webster defines the word as "to feel sorry for or reproachful for what one has done or has not done". Webster also gives the definition as to feel such regret and dissatisfaction over some past action or intention as to change one's mind about it or to change one's way.   Repentance requires the right attitude towards sin. This is Godly sorrow. Repentance is the right attitude toward God, it is a return to God. Repentance is the right attitude toward self. The Prodigal Son came to himself. Repentance is the right attitude toward others.  Repentance is not just Godly sorrow. Paul told the Corinthians in II Cornithians, Chapter 7, verse 10, that Godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of. Repentance is not gloomy despair. When Judas sold his Master for thirty pieces of silver, he was filled with gloom and despair, so much that he committed suicide, but he did not repent. Repentance is not quitting a sin for a season, it is totally turning from that act of sin. It is a complete one hundred-eighty degree turn. Repentance is not concealing sin. David tried to conceal his sin, but God exposed it. The story is told in Numbers Chapter 32, verse 23. We even know about David's sin today. Concealing sin is like trying to cover up spilled seed in order to hide it. The seed comes up and is exposed.     Repentance must be followed by works proving that change. In Acts Chapter 19, verse 19, the repentance was evidenced in the bringing of books valued at fifty thousand pieces of silver and burning them before all men. This let all men know of the change. The Thessalonians showed their sincerity by turning from idols to serve the one true God, First Thessalonians, Chapter 1, verse 9. Paul wrote the first letter to the Corinthians and included a scathing denunciation of their sinful deeds. However, part of the second letter to them was written commending them for turning from their vile way of living. A certain man had two sons, and he said unto one, "Go work today in my vineyard", and he answered, 'I will not': but afterward he repented and went". This story is told in Matthew Chapter 21, verses 28 and 29. Whatever this young man did, Jesus said he repented. Jesus called his actions repentance. The young man reflected over the matter, he came to know that he was wrong, realizing that he had sinned against his father. Having arrived at this conclusion, the young man faced about in an opposite direction and did according to his father's request.     All men need to repent. All men sin and as a result, all men need to turn from sin and turn to righteousness.|`|BtygS0Hraa	Oh boy I wish it was that easy!  That is merely the first step.  You have to pray to God in faith with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, truly forsaking the sin.  You must confess the sin, to God if it is something smaller, and to your bishop (in the LDS religion) if it is something serious.  After you truly pray to be forgiven of the sin, you must never return to your sinful action.  Christ's atonement allows us to be forgiven of the sins, for he suffered for them already.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	To repent means to turn your life around.  It is a plan of action that will turn us back to Him.  Whatever we do, it has to be with the complete understanding that the purpose is to restore the relationship between us and God.  Look into your own heart and see what has disrupted the relationship.  It is often our inner desire to live our lives for our own happiness.      Our task on earth is to seek our Creator, to allow Him to reveal Himself to us, to know Him and experience Him and to proclaim Him.  Anything that stands in the say of doing that is sin and we must have a plan to deal with it.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	I pray every night that God will forgive me of my sins, he did when I got saved, all previous sins so in his prayer it says in the prayer Jesus said on how to pray in Matt 6:9  12And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.      13And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:  as an ex-mormon I know about fasting one day once a month, I have done the three day fast and a five day fast, I have heard a person can do a seven to ten day fast and still not be considered anerexic, but I have not gone that many days without food (I drink loads of water) this is to get me closer to the lord and away from the world. the commercials for food on the t.v,.about drive me crazy!!!!|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	"Repent" is an English language word. You can find its meaning in any reputable dictionary.     It means to "turn away."    When one repents of sin, one turns away from sin.|`|bT3mzootaa	Repenting means that you come to realize that sin has separated you from GOD.You come to peace with your maker when you acknowledge that you cant ever over come sin on your own.That's when your faith in JESUS CHRIST comes in.HE is and always will be the sacrifice for our sins.The scripture says that the blood of the lamb washes away the sins of the world..But this can only happen if you receive HIM in your life as your personal lord and savior.The scripture goes on to say that if those that are in CHRIST do sin then we have an advocate who mediates for us.Thus we are SAVED BY GRACE!! GOD BLESS|`|C9nOqOZKaa	You are confusing Belief with Faith.  You can do all the works in the world to be Saved, but they are meaningless if you do not have FAITH, if you dont do them with FAITH, from the bottom of your heart, without expecting anything.  There are many examples in the Bible where you can deduct that "not only of bread does the body feed itself, but also in the FAITH in Jesus Christ"    Believing in Jesus Christ is doing the word of God and believing in IT.  It's imitating JC.  NOw, how do you repent ?  Well, you will only repent when you have faith in JC, when you think you need to repent to believe in HIM.  When you repent wholeheartedly in the name of JC it means you will avoid doing the same wrongs, errors, mistakes that compromise your covenant with God.  Above all, it's having FAITH in the Son of Man, the Son of God, and when you have FAITH in HIM your sins are already forgiven.  Confess your sins to Jesus Christ so He will cleanse you thoroughly. Remember, ask and it shall be given. You ask for forgiveness wholeheartedly (with FAITH) and it shall be given to you.|`|4dLPiqlZaa	Repentance means to turn your back on sin and turn to God and His Ways.  The Word of God tells us what is sin, it is "missing the mark of Torah", missing the mark of God's Word.  When we sin we are not living as God's Word tells us we should.  God says in His Word to "be holy as I am holy".  Does that mean that we can be perfect, no.  After we accept Yeshua (Jesus) as our Savior then we received the Holy Spirit and He guides us in that forgiveness and righteous and holy life.    Now you also asked about atonement which is a part of the above process.  Atonement simple means "to pay for".  There is a price to be paid for sin.    When Adam and Eve sinned by disobeying God in the garden of eden the price was death.  God did not want to kill His creation so God killed an innocent lamb in the garden and "covered" Adam and Eve's sin with it's blood and the skin of the animal that they wore was covering them.  The death sentence of Adam and Ever was paid by the innocent lamb who had not sinned.  The sin has to be atoned for.    This is the basis of the sacrifices of the Old Testament that Yeshua is the fulfillment of those shadow pictures, His death and resurrection. So when you "accept" Yeshua as your Savior what you are actually doing is laying your hand upon His Body on the stake and saying that He is your "atonement" sacrifice for your sin.  You are telling God that you are sorry for your sins and that you wish to be "at one" with Him, reconcilled to Him.      He accepts your sacrifice, Yeshua, because it is perfect and without blemish, and because your heart is sincere.  You then have turned your back on sin and turned to God.  You proceed to live a holy and righteous life with the help of the Holy Spirit.    If you see in the example of Abraham, God counted his faith, his belief in God, as righeousness.  Then later when God instructs Abraham to sacrifice his only son Isaac whom he loves, Abraham obeys God and is willing to sacrifice all for God.  God then tells Abraham that his faith is "proven" by his actions of obedience.      That is the right order.  Faith then obedience.  You cannot gain salvation from obedience then faith.  It isn't the right order.  Your faith is "proven" with your obedience.  You obey because you love God.  The other way is salvation by works and God tells us that it is by faith faith and that we could never do enough good because "none is good, no not one", Romans 3:12.      Repent - accept Yeshua as your payment for your sin - live a righteous and holy life through the Holy Spirit.  To know Him and how to live that life - Study the Word, Read the Word, front to back every year, Pray, pray, pray, worship Him, exercise your faith, desire to really KNOW Him, hold nothing back from His sanctification.    My prayers for you.|`|AA11713693	Repenting is not doing the sin that you have done and never do it again. It is also praying to the Lord and asking for forgiveness.|`|tl2pMkOcaa	Be careful...    You may very well have blasphemed the Holy Spirit.    If so, then there's no forgiveness for you.    If that is the case, it's OK to have fun now!    :)|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Which Christ?     The one from the Bible, who is God Himself....... or the Mormon "christ" who is not God Himself?    There's obviously a difference, as 2 Corinthians 11:4 says there is one true Jesus, and many false "jesuses" that cannot save anyone.    And to answer your question, repent in Greek is "metonea" which means change your mind, from unbelief in Jesus, to belief in Jesus.|`|ad6XOMliaa	repent literally means to "go back"; go back to how you were before you went astray.|`|RC5RAzykaa	To repent means to "turn away" from sin.    Sin is transgression of the law    1st John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.    The wage of sin is death    Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.    We are talking about spiritual death.    You will partake of the lake of fire, which is the second death, unless you confess your sins.    1st John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us [our] sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.    Repentance is required as well:    Luke 13:5 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.    Acts 3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;    But the most important thing is believe upon Jesus:    John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on Him should not perish (in the lake of fire) but have everlasting life.    Sin IS a sentence to the lake of fire, except that we repent of (turn away from) and confess our sins, and believe that Jesus paid the price for our sins.    If we continue to sin, we show that the love of God is not in is. Remember that sin is transgression of the LAW!    If you break any of the Ten Commandments (LAW)and do not turn from this sin, you are in deep trouble    We are under grace, but grace is never to be used as an excuse for sin. If you think breaking the Ten Commandments is excusable, you show yourself to love sin. You will die the second death if you love sin.    I tell you the truth. Many people keep the Ten Commandments in all but one. The Holy Sabbath is Saturday, the seventh day. break the Holy Sabbath and you sin, you transgress the Law.    James 2:10 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one [point], he is guilty of all.    If you are guilty of failing to keep the Holy Sabbath, and you do not repent of this, you are guilty of breaking the WHOLE LAW!    This means very simply that a person who breaks the Holy Sabbath is guilty of  1 not loving God  2 being an idolater  3 taking the Lords name in vain  4 not keeping the Sabbath (as defined)  5 dishonoring father and mother  6 murder  7 adultery  8 stealing  9 bearing false witness against your neighbor  10 coveting your neighbors wife and posessions    Fail to keep the Holy Sabbath and you are a murderer!  Not my words, but Gods!    The Holy Sabbath begins at sundown Friday and ends sundown Saturday, this has been, and always will be the case.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I'm Roman Catholic.  Read the Gospel of Saint Matthew chapter 7 verses 21-27.  Jesus told us we must do the Will of His father in Heaven.  Even if you reject the teaching of the Catholic Church, accept the words of Jesus Himself.  Works matter.  It is through our works that we accept the mercy of Jesus Christ.  Invite Christ and The Holy Spirit more fully into your life by letting His Love show in your actions.  The best way to repent of your sins, in my opinion, is to engage in good acts.  Visit the sick and lonely, feed the hungry,  be kind to people who are outcasts,  volunteer to mop your church's floors, volunteer to mow the lawn at church.  Purposely do good things to make your whole life a rejection of Satan and an invitation to God to use you more.    Peace be with you.|`|AA11124121	Baptism|`|bYDVTv7Maa	I think that "repenting" is just reflecting on your sins and being sorry for them, accepting Christ and all that.|`|4boTYkt7aa	The scriptures tell us that faith without works is dead.And repenting is truly turning away from the sins you used to be involved in.That is a must for salvation.God tells us what we must do to be saved,you must hear the truth,believe the truth,confess that Jesus is the Son of God,repent of your sins,and be baptized into Jesus's death to have your sins washed away.You must be completely submerged in the water,but it's not the water that washes away your sins,it's Jesus's blood.Being baptized symbolizes the old person dying and the new person being ressurected,coming from the water a new creature.I hope this helps you.May peace be with you.|`|wlYcWaQ3aa	Even demons believe. That is not enough. Demons do not change their ways.  Repent means to have a change of heart and mind concerning your own practice of disobeying God. Following that change you take steps in the right direction by being obedient to Christ's command to be baptized. This act of obedience brings the Holy Spirit who comes to dwell within.  The hornets have been disturbed. Here come the negative ratings.
7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	This is an LDS concept and no matter how you slice it, they don't understand it. But then on the same thing I don't understand the concept of the trinity either. For God is the Father (separate individual) who sent his Son (also a separate individual)     Yet ironically and  stated this from wikipedia:   The New Testament does not use the word "??" (Trinity) nor explicitly teach it.    Of course trinitarians state the bible does show it as much as it shows LDS members that the Bible shows three separate personages.

This doesn't say, "one in purpose" or "godhead". It says "one God".

AQPmrsVSaa	I would be pretty miffed from something like that. He didn't have to cancel the date, just the romantic/flirting aspect of it. Could've said "hey, I have a girlfriend now, but if you want we can hang out still," or something, if he cared about anything but fooling around. Just because he has a girlfriend, he can't hang out with you anymore, even just to be friendly? He can't associate with any female besides her?    What a loser. For minimal drama, just tell him "okay" and don't bother with him from now on.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	Better than the alternative of going out with you on the date then you finding out later that he had started with a new girlfriend.

If a man wants to date a different girl then he has that right to.  When it comes to dating it is basically the man who has to do all the approach and take most the risk of rejection so he is basically finding the woman to make him happy.

16EYP0Xiaa	I don't think so. You are not forgetting your native tongue or your culture. I don't have an "English Only" mentality, but I definitely have an "English Also" mentality.  Meaning, people don't need to give up their native tongue when they come here,  but to thrive, they need to learn English as best they can.    People who come to the US and don't learn English are only putting themselves at a huge disadvantage. Yes I know most people struggle with it, but I have run across people who make zero effort to learn English. It only hurts them and their children.    Some Spanish-speaking people feel that they shouldn't have to learn English because this was once part of Mexico....but they forget that Spanish was imported from Europe too, just like English. Moctezuma didn't speak Spanish as his first language nor did Cuauhtmoc.|`|f9yE6qAuaa	I totally clap my hands to you to think this!  Your right if you can learn the language  then anyone could. You know that if you move to Australia and want to become a citizen you have to speak English. But I can understand in a way that they might not want to learn cause America makes it to darn easy  for them to get around since  We cater to them to not need to  learn  English. Other nationalities aren't catered too and have no choice. But I've met ppl that came  right off the boat from a Asian country or some European country  and 6 mos later they spoke decent English.     But you are not a bad person to feel this way!  Cause if they want to move and better themselves they only can better themselves to a certain point if they are too lazy to learn English.|`|dVaD4Cxpaa	Don't feel bad. I only speak English. I wouldn't be caught dead going to France, Spain, etc.. without learning the language. It is just plain rude.

qDYzdz5daa	The whole 2012 thing is idiotic, and everyone who wastes more than a minute's thought on it should be rounded up and forcibly sterilized for the good of the species.    It's garbage.    Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012."     (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That is right I believe what Jesus says not man.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	The Mayan calendar ends on 12/21/2012. They did predict the arrival of Cortes, who conquered their civilization- they predicted the exact day of his arrival!    However, the devil tries to predict the future, but he can't. This date on the Mayan calendar is significant, in that a celestial event that occurs only once every 25,000 years will occur on 12/21/2012. But personally, I think the rapture will happen before that.    Only God knows when the end will come.|`|ljUYkKE3aa	It's not real, my opinion is that the Mayans had people who could see into the future and said "aw crap were going to be dead in a 100 years|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Yes, He will come as a theif in the night.   So what does that tell you?   It means we don't know what hour He cometh.    So why continually dwell on this date?    Live life and be happy and yet at the same time live everyday as if it's your last.    That doesn't mean to sit around and go crazy over one date, that only a human could predict.      Only God knows that answer.   Take  it to the Lord.   Peace be with You.|`|2TUKo7ryaa	no nothing happened dec 21 1912

defde0b6e42848179471ab740c517f46aa	I thought about that too.  The guy who played his brother would have been a better fit.  I think there is a lot of pressure for both men and women in the media to be really thin.  I also think (unfortunately by the way) that the producers were playing up the stereotype of what a gay man should look like.|`|3msXkjq3aa	yeah i did wonder about that     but i think they went more on how his face looked and he might have sounded just like Bobby did when he was alive?|`|UbvglIS6aa	The current media is obsessed with thin.  Personally, I like men in good shape, but with good muscle definition so they don't look too thin.  Skinny is not my idea of being in good shape.  Lean and muscular is a much better look.|`|sgRJRuvgaa	You know I've noticed this trend. Guys in magazines weren't as thin as they are now from years back. To be honest I can't stand skinny guys they are just not attractive. To me the real bobby before he died had like a perfect build that actor was just to small. I have no idea what the obsession is both in men and women. (not bi)  And I also did notice at the end of the movie what was with that. but I do think that the bobby was still a good actor for the role thin or not. I mean just because he didn't look like him fully he portrayed the charecter really well|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	they hired the actor, who as an actor is expected to be thin, im seif he wa a little chubby they would have found soeone else, image is everything these days.    makes me so angry.... ever since Gucci lacd the pour homme campaign male models have lost most of ther fat.... its ridiculuous and encorages people like me to purge|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Unless the physical manifestation of the actor must absolutely mimic that of the historical figure being portrayed (like Hal Holbrook playing Mark Twain or George C. Scott playing Patton) I think directors look for the actor's ability to portray the character believably. Unless there's a REAL disconnect between the physical being and the character being portrayed, the audience can usually suspend disbelief long enough to focus on the performance and not the actual actor.    In the theatre there are a number of instances where physical type/sex is purposely manipulated. Frequently you'll find Peter Pan played by a young woman who will appear more "boyish" than a real man will or can. In stories where race is the story's main theme (like Shakespeare's Othello) it's kind of important that Othello appear as a black man (whether he be truly of African decent or a white guy in black face) and Desdemona as a lady of European extraction.    I don't think the young man in "Prayers" was uncharacteristically thin and that probably wasn't a strong consideration. Granted, the director probably wanted someone "youthful" and not grossly overweight but I'm sure the actor's ability to carry off the role was paramount to the actor's physical appearance.    I'm sure you've heard of actors bulking up or slimming down to inhabit a character more realistically. Often, that is the actor's choice and not the director's mandate. The actors are simply interested in delivering a performance that is as genuine as possible.

I didn't have my contacts in so I thought at a glance that it was his brother whom I told quickly to "get out!" While still in position... my husband had pulled the covers up and when I turned back to him he quietly said, "that isn't my brother that is my dad", which sent me under the covers until he was gone from the house!

Even though if families came here legally, and they wanted to stay, exactly how are they supposed to go about doing that? What is the procedure that the US has offered in becoming a citizen? Pretty much the only option is to get married. Haven't you heard of people paying over $8,000 to get married to an unknown person and pretend that they are living together just for their green cards? Haven't you seen how hard these Hispanic immigrants work their asses off to pay their rent and support their families? Aren't you willing to pay them the lowest wages for their hard labor? They are already NOT living the American Dream...like so many aren't. What more do we want from them? The US has so much land...and so much wasted money.

I do, however, have a problem with the following:    1. Americans who complain about immigrants not 'knowing English': When we, as Americans, stop using "words" like 'conversate', 'irregardless', and phrases like, 'should have went', then we can tell immigrants how to speak well.  Until then, pipe down.    2. Americans who say that something is as 'American' as Apple pie (Dutch) and hamburgers (German).  Know the origins of your 'culture', people.    3. Americans who insist that immigrants 'assimilate' to American culture, a culture largely based on other cultures.    4. White Americans who complain about 'illegals', as if coming to a country, reclaiming the land as your own, and enslaving its people is 'legal'.    5. Racists who say that immigrants should go 'back to where they came from'.  Newsflash: The only Americans that can say, "Go back to where you came from" are Native Americans.|`|qWu5F1O2aa	If i did then i'd dislike where i came from. I'm american, but my parents are Dutch.

I completely agree with Capricorn12, if you cant do things right, then stop telling others what to do|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	Yes. I think we need to center ourselves around helping our own country. To do this we need to stop immigration (for a while), foreign aid, wars for others freedom, etc... and start fixing our internal problems.|`|oXrDKjkkaa	Only if they're here illegally.  In my state, the new legislation for public instruction this year cuts EVERYTHING - except for the one million dollar RAISE in bilingual education.  The US is probably the only county in the world where you can move, not speaking the language, and demand that the public schools teach your child English at THEIR expense.  I'm a teacher - haven't had a raise in years, buy my own materials for my classroom, have struggling students who cannot get any extra help because there's no money, but then I watch illegals bring their kids in and get all kinds of benefits, including free language instruction.  LA had to close several trauma centers because illegals used them for routine doctor visits, didn't pay, of course, and in turn bankrupted the hospitals.  My ancestors came through Ellis Island; had to pass rigorous tests.  Who knows?  Maybe some of them got sent back because they were criminals, sick, or insane!!!!!!!|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	If we would let people inother countries vote for the United States President in their own country they wouldn't need to come here as illegal aliens to do it.|`|GMFXD1ENaa	The United States is a nation of immigrants. I love how we're comprised of so many different cultures. As long as prospective citizens abide by our laws, including immigration laws, I have no problem whatsoever.|`|Qt3Zqfviaa	hell no|`|wkKJpCwRaa	The only problems I have if it occurs is if they are illegal and especially if they don't say the Pledge of Allegiance. Whenever they refuse to say the Pledge, it especially bothers me. Any other time, no I do not have issues with them, I'd welcome them more than anything.|`|f120d9b30884a763a4f93cef49dee32eaa	Nope. Two of my best friends are first generation Americans; their parents are from Mexico. They have as much of a right to be here as anyone else.|`|azKH25wZaa	Of course not :) Immigrants seem alot kinder than U.S. citizens. Seriously. One did my laundry when I was sick with the flu. And no I'm not kidding. Couldn't even get my friends to help me out. Lazy Americans.
14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	There are two aspects of Karma involved in your tale.  The first is your friends desire turned into action that caused him to steal.  This set a Kamic due bill within a MINDLine within his MIND realm that must be paid off at some later time, in this life or another life.    The second Karma was harm  to himself that had to take place,  and this was from some other time.    Your accepting the furits of his theft sets a Karmic due bill within some MINDLine within your MIND realm that you will have to have taken from you at some future point what was given to you as a result of the theft.    As for other dynamics of the event, some Karma is worked out via ones psychological patterns... some of which includes self-harm and this may be an instance of this.    My advice for what it's worth is to stay clear of those who have little Conscience and little Discretion since they are at best remaining level and not elevating.    Peace|`|8FO52r0Maa	no I would just call it somebody being stupid when they are stoned|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	SURE|`|bnPPrJY1aa	I call it funny|`|0muvYszmaa	no but your friend is a huge stoned retard.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	no, he was probably stoned and just dropped the bong.

a5Z1xfejaa	satan counts as another mythical being, yes.|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	Uhhh no god created sin and bad stuff.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	I can create a cake, but that doesnt make me God. In fact I can create another life, but Im not God.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	No.  He was referred to as a son of the morning.  That means that at one time he was one of the preeminent spirits in heaven but through his rebellion, he lost his preeminence and any hope he ever had of becoming like our Father, God.|`|ScmAk5EVaa	He creates nothing only distorts and destroys what God has created so no|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	"There is no Satan, that's just God when he's drunk." -T. Waits.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	no, he was a fallen angel, and that is it.|`|89MKzLl3aa	No honey, Satan is a fallen angel. God created all things including the bad.|`|0muvYszmaa	yes because he has followers and he is considered too strong to be just a demon.|`|KFpEaY3raa	false god..he didn't create anything.|`|UBYu08bOaa	...I guess, not.|`|0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	ummmmmmmm NO WAY!!|`|4sUek7ugaa	In any polytheistic religion he would be considered one of the gods.  Christianity has the biggest pantheon of any supposedly monotheistic religion ever.|`|k3LbhASGaa	if you want to call evil God then go ahead , but for me I  will stick  as best as I can to good|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Absolutely not.|`|0bOSZIzJaa	He should at least be a demigod, but oh-no, now we are back to polytheism!      Most theologians describe satan as a void or vacuum where god does not exist, so satan isn't really a thing, but an absence of god.  Of course this reasoning only leads to more questions... Why can't god "fill" this void?  Doesn't this imply that god is omnipresent, and there are things god cannot do?      None of it makes sense.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	He didn't create sin. Sin is not doing good. How does one create a verb?|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Umm.. no.|`|U24VtSlZaa	depends on who's counting|`|bOiAHI8paa	there is only one god- god.|`|wywdxhBAaa	Nope.  He's a mere and lowly "prince".  Even Christians are ABOVE him, for we are the Kings and Lords that Jesus is King and Lord over; hence Christ's title: "King of Kings and Lord of Lords"... this excludes Satan, the lowly prince.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	No  God wants the best for us.  The devil wants to break us from Gods power.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Take a break and read about Satan and His connection to you and I.    PAPER 53 - THE LUCIFER REBELLION    Page 602  Very little was heard of Lucifer on Urantia (Earth ) owing to the fact that he assigned his first lieutenant, Satan, to advocate his cause on your planet|`|WZ6YXDODaa	Satan is NOT a God. He is just a fallen spirit who went against the real God.|`|GK00Rz5caa	Not like God or Satan exist, but if you believe in them, yes, Satan is a god.|`|f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	Satan at one time was a very powerful angel who wanted to be worshiped and he is called the God of this system of things.  If you have any doubt start watching the news.|`|NqOxQzlraa	Well people worship Satan as a god, so yes.|`|AA11124121	he was never a god...before or after his fall from Grace.    now he's the Father of Lies.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	Well, he has supernatural powers, so yeah, by most definitions, he's a god.    Actually, Beelzebub, one name for Satan, probably derives from Ba'al Zebul, or lord prince.  Ba'al was an acknowledged rival god to YHWH in the Bible ('thou shalt have no other gods before me' is a pretty clear acknowledgement that other gods, such as Ba'al, exist).|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Sure. God created evil. ISAIAH 45:7  "I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create EVIL. I the LORD do all these things".    Please christians, give evil to it's rightful owner! GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|4bm6xNyEaa	Satan was a fallen angel and so were the deamons and why he fell was because he thought he was bigger and better than god whitch wasn't true|`|9cd8c6b665801fa3741c5e0688ea8edaaa	Satan (meaning resister) and Devil (meaning slanderer)    I know most people will tell you no, however the Bible says YES!!!!    1Co 8:5-6 .?.?.For even though there are those who are called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, just as there are many gods and many lords, 6?there is actually to us one God the Father, out of whom all things are, and we for him; and there is one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are, and we through him.      Re 12:9 .?.?.So down the great dragon was hurled, the original serpent, the one called Devil and Satan, who is misleading the entire inhabited earth; he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.     Lu 4:6-7 .?.?.and the Devil said to him: I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. 7?You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.     The Devil offered Jesus all the kingdoms (governments) of the world.  How could he do this if they didn't belong to him?  He himself answers -'because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it'  Yes it belongs to him!!    1Jo 5:19 . . .We know we originate with God, but the whole world is lying in the [power of the] wicked one.      The prophet Micah speaks for himself and for other faithful ones like himself when he says: All the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god; but we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever. (Mic. 4:5) Very fittingly, till the end of his prophetic book Micah raised the challenging question, Who is a God like you, one pardoning error and passing over transgression of the remnant of his inheritance?Mic. 7:18.    2Co 4:3-4 .?.?.If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, 4?among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.     "the god of this system of things" can be none other than Satan who blinds the minds of people.  'god' is not capitalized when referring to him!!    Re 16:13-16 .?.?.And I saw three unclean inspired expressions [that looked] like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the wild beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 14?They are, in fact, expressions inspired by demons and perform signs, and they go forth to the kings of the entire inhabited earth, to gather them together to the war of the great day of God the Almighty. 15?Look! I am coming as a thief. Happy is the one that stays awake and keeps his outer garments, that he may not walk naked and people look upon his shamefulness. 16?And they gathered them together to the place that is called in Hebrew HarMagedon.    Yes - Satan day is coming when he and his demons will be destroyed!!!!  Then Jesus (God's Son) will rule.

Also on the dark side - we may have all the real estate, but what's the point without tourism ? Kind of like owning an island and looking at it through binoculars because we don't have a boat to get there. The universe is like a pretty picture too vast for us to comprehend in its smaller bits. There won't be liquid water on the surface of our planet in a billion years. We're literally at the mercy of astronomical phenomenon. Andromeda is on a collision course with the Milky Way.

God has given us himself that we may be like him, and he has reserved for himself of power and glory only that which is necessary for the maintenance of those things for the love of which he has thus divested himself of all things else.    5. THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE              There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending. Everything familiar to us has an end.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	There's much scientific literature on the subject.

XEbrGfZuaa	I was born in '43. So I am an official Senior Citizen. What is new that  I didn't have as a child, are many many things. For I wasn't pampered  and given many toys. So I went to friends houses to play with theirs.  We didn't even have one board game to play. So setting toys aside,  I would have to go with all of the modern inventions, since then. The  private phone line, the modern telephones, the washer and dryer,  the dishwasher, the modern steam irons, the portable barbeque  grills. Three speed and plus bikes and trail bikes. City railroads for  electric trains through cities, fast cars and small ones at that. And  cars that run on electricity. Dentists that do treatments with lazers.  The modern improvements for all medical care, including medicines  that help conditions today that weren't available back when. I forgot  to add refrigerators that drop frozen ice and cold water from their  front doors, in the home appliance area. New scanners at inter-  sections that alert police when  you are speeding. And some   radar that catches if you don't have insurance on your car when   you pass by. Basically anything that was improved or invented  since 1961 in my case. There are too many new innovations since  I was a girl. And there will be more, before I die. I'm glad to have  lived as long as I have, to see how life can be made to live more  comfortable. I don't think I would have faired well in my grandmothers  early years using a scrubbing board to wash clothes outside in a  big washtub on a farm. I'm glad that she lived long enough to enjoy  alot of modern inventions in her kitchen and where she lived later  before she passed away. I don't expect that as great of revelations  will be invented in my time.

Buy and oiggie board  2. hold a seance with your pals  3. attempt communication with bloody mary    An oiggie board is soemthing used to communicate with the dead. try to get one on ebay or amazon. but be aware that oiggie boards are dangerous things.  Also beaware that bloody mary might:  1. scratch your eyes out  2. take you into the mirror world  3. kill you  4. scratch you  5. fill the bathroom in blood.    It's best to do this bloody mary thing in the bathroom, with friends. remember it must be very dark in the bathroom.  I have tried this and have found it unsuccessful.  tell me how it goes, hope i helped!|`|1wNsBNmxaa	She is said to appear in a mirror when her name is called three times (or sometimes more light a candle and then who ever calls her name will die  a horrified death    D?mon~~?|`|uktBnDP3aa	turn off all lights in bathroom (as dark as possible) stare into mirror and say bloody mary 45-100 times and her face willl appear angry faced turn on lights to hurt her and shell go away|`|DvX3gTFlaa	turn off the lights in the bathroom and say bloody mary in the mirror 3 times|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Yeah, sure.

SGSl5yeAaa	Well the word literally means "universal."  There is a difference between (c)atholic and (C)atholic.  Catholic is your current denomination, and catholic means something that applies to all Christians.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Literally?    Universal.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	small c: universal  large c: Catholic (as in Roman Catholic)|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	catholic with a small c means the universal church of Christ. Catholic with a big C is the denomination of the Holy Catholic church.|`|1ffb5797d2e26ccb8eb17dd3db6e22c0aa	Catholic is from the greek word katholos or "Universal" it was the term used by Christians in the 1st couple of centuries to describe the group of believers which followed Jesus's teachings.. They believed that ALL believers, regardless of where they existed in the world, represented a "universal church" or Catholic church.     This term then got applied to specifically mean the Catholic church centered in Rome Italy.. aka the "roman catholic church"  or RCC.  When PRECISELY when this happened is unclear to historians, even within the  Catholic church.  SOME will say Emperor Constantine called it that around 400AD,  but it was in use before hand.  Some say the Ignatius of Antioch was referring to the Catholic church as an organized institution in 110AD when he wrote in Greek and called it "this catholic church" and urged people to follow their Bishops and take the Eucharist.    So WHEN exactly the word got applied specifically to the Catholic church we know today.. is debatable.    The Catholic church is the ONLY Christian religion which can say it has a DIRECT link back to the 1 Apostle which Christ himself appointed as "head of his church"   Jesus said to Peter that he was his ROCK and upon him he would build his church.  In ancient times..you always tried to build buildings on "rock" verses sand or mud.  So in saying this he was saying Peter was the FOUNDATION.  Jesus ALSO promised Peter that the Gates of Hell would not prevail against his church.      Peter didn't start the Catholic church..but his sucessors DID..giving the Catholic church a DIRECT unbroken link back to him in the form of the Popes.    This is what gives Catholicism its strength and authority and why it never changes it core beliefs..because they were instituted by the aposltes themselves.     SO..the WORD itself...merely means "universal"  where as that word is generally used to apply itself to the RCC.|`|AA12203324	"Universal".  This means that Christianity is available to anyone.  It is not racial, tribal or nationalistic.  Since the Protestant Reformation, the term has gotten an additional meaning, referring to the Rome-based Christian Church as opposed to the Protestant movement.|`|xTcjL7a5aa	It means you're egocentric....|`|VuGPufs4aa	that you belong to just another club .like the moose  or v.f w and like all of them you have to pay dues ,,but to beggars|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Universal
pYn2L2DHaa	1. Not really.  Some guys like to be tied up to their beds during sex because the feeling of being submissive and helpless is a turn-on, but heavy duty bondage is a specialty fetish.

Bears are usually men with lots of hair and they tend to be on the larger side not always fat but bigger than the average guy.    Not sure if it is common for them to wear the harnesses but i know that some do because they are submissive and their dominate requests them to.     Hope this helped a little bit. Have a great night.|`|A2xt8TfUaa	Well bonndage, = no. lol i never ever have been tied up and i will never be.

IxoBFCpTaa	Thanks to the Qur'aan, Muhammad (saw) was told this by Allaah. Keep in mind that all the correct astronomical studies did not appear until centuries after Muhammad (saw) died. Less did people know, these things were already in the Qur'aan.    Do not listen to Nur al Maseeh; he is the same person who says there are more than 1 version of the Qur'aan without any proof:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...        Peace  ^_^|`|uuUd5Zidaa	The Holy Prophet (SAW) was the living Quran.|`|be059bdf4ef4d8d4f864f42d17a8e06eaa	Ok i guess its possible.   But how probable?    The prophet was illiterate so he wasn't reading greek manuscripts.       He could have been exposed to people through trade routes that had exposure to these concepts....but again..how common is this in everyday conversations.   ...  Hey do you want to buy this....  SURE...did you hear about how the planets have distinct orbits??    How free flowing was this concept?   There are scientific concepts from the 70's that no one talks about today...they're true, just not talked about.    Or like certain things in science today...the average person doesn't know about their existence....just the scientific community.  Like if i said its possible for you to all of a sudden turn into a goldfish....the average person would say its absurd, but the scientists will say..yeah its a possibility.      YOu also have to take into account how many incorrect theories the greeks had....yet the prophet only happen to choose the correct ones?|`|WGUfF7reaa	of course he knew ! =>|`|cua3iiqIaa	im pretty sure Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) knew this, but the greek astronomers didnt, there is a lot of science in the Qur'an that is stuff that has been recently discovered. But Mohammad (pbuh) did not know this himself, it was sent by God to him so thats the only way he knew it.    btw the reason most of Europe got so advanced was cuz of the Arab technology, but the Arab leaders were greedy and took over Spain, then all of Europe joined and kicked the Arabs out and they took Spain again, but all the books in the Arab libraries were still there so the Europeans got a lot of knowledge from it.|`|h3gMzNS3aa	The Indians at that time knew that the earth was spherical and had calculated the circumference of the earth to almost the precise number.    The greeks were intelligent; the advent of christianity held back science in europe for about a thousand years. The library of alexandria had the largest collection of knowledge of the ancient world but it got burned down several times so we'll never know what that ancients really knew.|`|uO0knmZOaa	Honest scholarships have variously proved that Arabic Koran is less scientific than English Koran; and so are most translations of the Koran...being translated with the aim of inviting the scientific western World to Islam and making Koran look miraculously scientific.    For instance, like the Bible, the Koran says God created the universe in six days. But when scientific community challenged the idea of 'Six', most Muslim scholars started to translate the six days as 'six periods'. That has been the trend.|`|7NLezxRaaa	Abouth the six days thing, it does fit in scientifically. You have to take in general relativity. The universe is constantly expanding and the since space is getting bigger, time is changing as well, getting smaller i think. So 6 days then, seem like billions of years to us.    Muhammad pbuh was told and taught everything by Allah, so he knew what Allah told him, he couldn't have made the stuff by himself if thats what ur suggesting.|`|d1i3ac5baa	if you were to read ''the night journey'' you would see that mohammad knew the shape of the earth, flat! he climbed up to heaven on a golden ladder and talked a to allah. sura 17:1 confirms it. the quran describes the earth in every arabic word that exist that the world is flat. muslims that can read arabic know this.|`|Mt3KpoxOaa	The word  'Yasbahoon' in Quran (21:33)  means swimming in Arabic. it does not mean rotating around its own axis.

25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	People are just stupid sometimes.....That's the only thing I can come up with. My mother and sisters made awful comments about my grandson's name because it was the male version of his mothers first name and then his middle name is the same as his father's and grandfather's middle name. They thought it was hideous and actually said so! It's really not a bad name at all and it fits him so well. Don't pay any attention to people that can't keep their ugly comments to themselves.

LPO8RlVdaa	I have to disagree with Schroedinger here. The Gospels that WERE included were themselves hardly contemporary, being written 3 or 4 centuries after the time of Christ. Many of the gospels that were not included were contemporary with Christ, such as the Gospel of Judas and the Gospel of Magdelene.     These were not included however because they did not fit in with the specific version of events that the most powerful Christian faction at the time wanted the populace to believe. So basically the council of Nicea decided to leave them out so that the 'official' Christian bible kept one Christian sect in power, namely the St.Paul version of events (i.e Christ was devine, etc. Other Gnostic gospels stated he was just a man.)    So basically it was a power trip, so that one Christian sect could gain and keep power over the others, and eventually the general populace.|`|YmxuG6Zyaa	because they reveal the truth   in phillips gospel alot of things are methioned that the church does not want known as does the gnostic gospels  whereas the gossple of judies raises the idea that it is a conspiraty|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Usually because there are doubts or disagreements about authenticity or authorship.|`|tTf1Zp5eaa	Probably because it would make the bible even more unbelievably ridiculous than it already is perhaps?|`|9BeUbORtaa	I think the choice of Gospels in the New Testament can be justified quite strongly on a historical/textual basis. Most of the books which are mentioned as 'alternative Gospels' are much later third or fourth-century Gnostic texts, which may not be without value in themselves, but certainly lack the authority of the four canonical Gospels, none of which is much later in date than the first quarter of the second century.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Because they did not fit.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	maybe tell us more        so that we can attempt to answer|`|uzVaMiMUaa	When Constantine formed the Church of Rome he and his chosen peers decided upon which texts should be included in their interpretation of the Christian story.

jdKTs3aHaa	well sky is more for just saying sky as in the clouds and what's up above and heaven has a more religious view and is seen as god's home and where people go when they die.  hope that answers b/c i'm not sure how would you explain sky xD  ps: If you write this way only by teaching yourself then i think you're doing an excellen job! =)|`|AN9PdKmgaa	sky and heaven mean two different things. the sky is just what you see above you heaven is a place where god is and is somewhere too far up to see from here|`|FyHaU0D6aa	When referring to the religious place where you go after you die, its always Heaven (usually capitalised).    When referring to that thing with the clouds that keeps hanging over us, sky is more common.    Kingdom of the Sky (note the definite articlethis is not used with Heaven, since its considered a proper noun, i.e., a name) could be the title of a movie, too; but whereas as Kingdom of Heaven makes you think about religion, eternal bliss, Heavenly piece and such things, Kingdom of the Sky sounds more like it has to do with birds and aeroplanes. It has to do with the physical sky thats above us.    Occasionally, in more rhetorical or poetic settings, the heavens is used in the plural (not capitalised) to mean the sky, i.e., the physical sky. Same with the skies, which is slightly less poetic than the heavens, but still more poetic than the sky.|`|AIpsEwqfaa	si hablas espa?ol:  sky es el ke puedes ver, donde estan las nubes etc.    heaven es el ke no puedes ver, la gloria eterna, lo angeles, etc    =)|`|9BeUbORtaa	These are two quite different usages. The word "heavens" (in the plural) can be used in a poetic sense to mean "the sky". "He raised his hand towards the heavens," essentially means "he pointed to the sky."    In the crappy-Ridley Scott-film sense, however, "Heaven" means "the Christian afterlife."  In Scripture, "Heaven" is often depicted as a walled city, although popular belief has it that it is 'up there' somewhere above the skies.  The word has particular relevance with reference to Jerusalem, which is sometimes called "the Heavenly City" because of its importance in Christian doctrine.

He says in that documentary that if he was not pregnant that everybody would consider him a man, without a second glance. That's how it should be.|`|peHZRvCSaa	your 100% right  some people just dont understand certian things|`|Wbo0PEZaaa	yes, what they "have down there" should determine their sex. I do not think that people should be able to decide what sex they want, they are just born that way. And if that person thinks that they should be able to choose, they are very sick and should press their thumbs against their eye sockets until their thumbs push through to their brain. Then they should have their skull smashed against the pavement and then should be thrown through a wood chipper|`|rMN96rbZaa	Personally, I think that the "pregnant man" is considered, in my opinion, a man.

FyHaU0D6aa	This one is very hard. There are many words I cant figure out, but Ill give it a go.    ?Numeric [byreingurmeans cargo vessel?!?] for destroying hundtyrkir [a mythological man-eating beast, half man, half dog] and foreign pirates.    This magic symbol, which is a binding rune [?], must be carved on the skin of a frumsafrumsa calf, which is the name of the offspring of a normal cow and a sea bull.    The following quatrain must be tied into [?] the binding rune in order to destroy the pirate ships:    High is the sail hoisted  hanged from a twined rope  Seen have I a carved rune  I come to it now [?]  Above all the land  let fear and storm stand,  sea spray with its sand  I send to my arch enemies?      I really, really cant figure out what byreingur is supposed to be. Its not in any dictionaries I have access to, and Googling doesnt help muchit just tells me its some kind of cargo ship.

30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	The Decembrist revolt or the Decembrist uprising took place in Imperial Russia on 14 December (26 December New Style), 1825. Russian army officers led about 3,000 soldiers in a protest against Nicholas I's assumption of the throne after his elder brother Constantine removed himself from the line of succession. Because these events occurred in December, the rebels were called the Decembrists. This uprising took place in the Senate Square in Saint Petersburg. In 1925, to mark the centenary of the event, it was renamed as Decembrist Square
3RQkgTSOaa	Don't be embarrassed about what you are. If you beat around the bush about your sexuality, that sends the message you aren't sure of yourself.    Do NOT apologize for being what you are. It's not your fault. It's not your Mom's fault. It simply is.    Keep a level head. Do not raise your voice and keep on an even keel. This will be a very emotional discussion for your Mom. You need to exude a competent and confident demeanor.    This is very new to your Mom. How long did it take you to figure out and accept your sexuality? Your Mom may need just as much time. Afford her that. Don't expect her to be OK with it right off the bat.    I realize YOU are the focus of this discussion but LISTEN to your Mom. What is she saying both literally and euphemistically? She is going to have a lot of concerns and may have trouble articulating them. Because of this you need to listen as best as you can and address any and all superficial as well as sub-textual concerns.    Answer any of your Mom's questions with confidence and candor. Things might get into some uncomfortable areas but your ability to navigate these questions with confident answers will do a lot for your Mom's respect in you. Be forthright and honest and show your Mom the proud and self-confident bi person you are.    Good luck.|`|PuWucUs3aa	mom, i just figured out that i'm bi. i've told my friends about it, and they're cool with it. i was afraid to tell you the truth but you're my mother, so you have to know. hope you won't get mad or hate me for this. i love you.|`|UVKSHcK8aa	Just tell her what you are, and that she doesn't need to worry, you are the SAME person as before, it's just that you are more open about who you are.

e78444897b166dc52e4eb7da1eaf3726aa	It sounds like you are the better person in all of this.  Don't get pulled into their ways!  I assume that you are in high school?  This is what girls do.  But the best thing to do is nothing and nice them to death!  trust me one day they will look back at this and say why were we so mean to someone who never did anything to us.  My husband and I talk about this often we picked at people.  I didn't like a girl in school because ALL the guys wanted to go out with her. Well alot happened in school we did alot of things to her. (that were really childish!)  Well it came back to bite me in the butt.  I had my car listed for sale and her mom came out to look at it and guess who was with her.  Afterwards when her mom bought my car I told the daughter that in high school  I was pretty mean I was sorry for anything that I had said or done to make her feel terrible. She was very accepting of my apology and forgiving.  I finally got  that off my concience. Trust me I explained that to my children you never know when you  may run back into these people!  Be nice and if you are a christian pray for them.

kYYHw7xEaa	No.  If I answered 30 years ago, I would have said "yes".  There are people who are inherently bad.  I've seen it.  Grandpa was a bad man.  Mom and dad are wonderful.  The kid is an absolute terror, and should be locked up.  It's not the parents fault! They're at their wits end.  Studies have been done on serial killers. A lot of them had very good backgrounds.  What went wrong?  He's "just bad" and always has been, is the answer.|`|207dFmdHaa	yes|`|8e7a94a0af2d078a41f902e73bf91f17aa	Yes, I do, as many as are born with "bad" "hearts".  Actually, don't know the ratio, but agree here with "bad seeds".  If though, they were the majority, we wouldn't have progressed this far.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	I believe that all children are born innocent and have good hearts.  They learn to be disappointed, and angry and mad, by their environ-  ments, and the hardships they endure so often. And not every child  comes into the world wanted by its' mother and father. There a child  is facing the disappointment of being unloved and often, uncared for.    I do think most of us go unscathed until we become young adults.  And then going out into the world and having to earn our own incomes  is often the real awakening to what being an adult is all about. Through  trying times, we learn how to achieve or fail and our failures often  give us a sour attitude which changes our perception of how we  treat others. This becomes increasingly inset and carries over to the  next level and the next, unless something happens to brighten the  persons outlook for all time. Usually with having a loving and trustworthy mate to share their future lives with.|`|oP3VVW5raa	Well, yes in a sense and no in another.    A baby is born selfish.  In fact in placental mammals the embryo's placenta  is considered a parasite to the endometrium of the uterus.  Babies are labour intensive and very draining.  They require full assistance from their caregivers just to grow.  And a 'good' parent knows when to start withdrawing that assistance in different stages.      This caregiving is however beyond the infants control.  If it is not met with loving devotion and hope for the future on behalf of the caregivers and community then the infant is in for a difficult time until they learn that 'every body is some body's sandpaper'.|`|O9FojdEMaa	no, some people are born psychopaths totally devoid of a conscience people like Ted Bundy,Jeffrey Dahlmer, John  Wayne Gacey, and so many others oh lets not forget the BTK killer and The Green River Killer. these people should be executed at birth but as yet we have no way to detect them until it's too late.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	No...I have seen otherwise,true...|`|P8dOSNslaa	sure|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	no|`|xw9jPhqAaa	No, there is lots of evil out there.|`|ZCh0OHuhaa	Nope!|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	There's been endless discussion of nature vs nurture.

VDTTzwlUaa	I have never seen it explicitly mentioned in any scripture that he has all of those qualities. However, it is implied he is in direct control of the events of history.    I don't know as much about Islam, or Judaism or any other religion as much as I know about Christianity (I am by no means an expert however) so I will talk about Christianity. In Christianity, it is common thought that God cannot bear the presence of sin and therefore we are separated from him without faith in the Messiah (Jesus). Within this line of thought, since God cannot tolerate sin (as sin causes pain, suffering and destruction) that sin cannot go unpunished or else he will be allowing people to subvert justice. Since he cannot simply forget sins (as they cause suffering, pain, destruction, ultimately death) he must punish sin. Now, in Christianity as we know it today (not the anti-trinitarian views that used to be more prevalent (if I am correct)) Jesus is an incarnate form of God.     Jesus being an incarnate form of God willingly submitted himself to a gruesome, humiliating death to overcome death and be a ransom for sin. It isn't that the pain and suffering was enough that it was punishment for the sins of all mankind, but the fact that Jesus being God, the shame and humiliation of his death (and meager birth and life) was enough to pay the price of sin. Since Christ was raised he defeated death and is a symbol of the resurrection of life that is to come.    So if you define omnipotence as God being able to do anything, that is not accurate. At least in Christianity, God cannot forsake part of his character and just let justice slide.    In Islam it is said that God can just forgive sins as he pleases.    In Judaism it is said that everyone is accountable of their own sin before God and I am not aware of God "wiping the slate clean" although in the Tanakh God does show some mercy and compassion towards some followers of his that don't do the right thing, e.g. king David killing Bathsheba's husband and God not killing him like he should have done.    As far as omniscience goes, it seems that if God knew your choices then that means he will have predestined you to do something which means that there really isn't free will. Well, you could look at it and say we look at the world and our lives as if we have free will but in God's eyes we don't. However, that just means we live in an illusion and we do not have a choice, so why wasn't everyone just made to worship God in the beginning and made to think we were choosing what to do? It seems that free will (and the concept of justice in Christianity) negate full omniscience (and in Christianity omnipotence).    Pearlysama, it kind of sounded like your explanation of God's omnipresence was talking about pantheism.

Its the oldie but goodie "Can God create a stone (mountain or whatever you want here) too heavy for God to lift?" One way or another the attribute of omnipotence runs into trouble if god can either not create a stone too heavy to lift or can't life the stone.    The claims for omniscience also conflict with other claims usually made for god. There are numerous conflicts here with the Christian god claims and concepts that have been argued back and forth between critical philosophers and apologists for quite awhile.  http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/arg...|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	God is beyond reason. Reason involves defining things. Defining involves limiting and containing things. God is perfect and unlimited. It is impossible to contain God in a definition. Therefore God cannot be described in full via reason. He is irrational in the purest sense.     This is why religion exists. It is the attempt to connect with God in a way that is not strictly bound by reason. As stated above we cannot fully connect with God via reason. An example in christianity is the belief that God humbled himself and became fully man and fully God. This is a contradiction; according to logic it is impossible. Yet people believe this because they believe that God is not bound by logic nor reason. They believe that He loves us so much that He would live and die among us. This is an example of people directly connecting to God in an irrational way.    * Here, "irrational" does not mean "stupid" it means "not contained in reason."|`|XTi1x0N0aa	Oh course. Why not?|`|XxWovDNCaa	Of course not.  Anyone who says that there can be, is either; an outright liar, or brainwashed to the point that they are no longer capable of independent thought.

To answer your question, what kind of qualities are you referring too?  Being Tripartite?  Being Monotheistic in a world of many so-called gods?  Being the only God that is reaching out to man instead of the other way around?    If it is any of these, the answer is yes...otherwise His reason for creating you in the first place becomes self-defeating.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Simply put, no.  To randomly select one characteristic of the Abrahamic God and expose it, we'll choose for this exercise omnipotence.  An all-powerful God cannot exist.  Either God could create a mountain so heavy that not even he could lift it, or he couldn't.  Either way, he can't be all-powerful.    Can the omniscient, all-powerful God, who works all things after the council of his own will (ephs 1:11), and therefore knows the future because he makes it, find the omnipotence to change his future mind, thereby negating what he knew to be the future in the past?  If he can, he isn't omniscient, if he can't, he isn't omnipotent.  Hence, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God cannot exist.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	I'd say yes. But I may also be a bit biased because that's what I believe in. However I would also like to point out that what is considered logical and rational depends on what we choose to accept as logical and rational based on our own individual experiences. Someone may be able to logically explain how the sky is not blue in their eyes, however based on what I see, the sky is clearly blue, and it will still not be logical because I cannot perceive what they do. In the end, its a matter of perception, not logic or rationality.    The Bible does not truly contradict itself when it comes to the qualities of God (I don't know about the Torah and Koran - sp?). It only seems contradicting to those who cannot perceive the explanations they give for these qualities when put together. For example, many cannot understand how a loving, good, all-knowing God could possibly knowingly create evil. But the solution is quite simple if you allow it to be; evil is the absence of God therefore God creates evil sheerly by existing himself. Can he remove evil? Yes. But that would require a whole host of things that we probably do not want (like lack of free will). People do not allow this to be logical because they cannot perceive it themselves.    Perception is key when it comes to explaining things that are not tangibly measurable and observable, like opinions, logic, and the supernatural.    But I guess I can try to say this in a way that may be more logical to you:  1) Think of God as energy. Law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. Energy can be converted into mass through the theory of relativity. This fits some of God's aspects (being the beginning and the end and being able to create matter from "air")  2) Energy is pretty much everywhere, whether it be potential or kinetic. Its in the very atoms that our world is composed of.  3) Being everywhere allows you to know everything because you are able to observe all things at all times.  4) Knowing everything and being everywhere essentially allows you to do anything.  5) Therefore, God can be everywhere, know everything, and do anything.    Did that make it make more sense? Its hard to use science to explain something that is not measurable and is not natural, so forgive me if all of that was wrong. It was worth a shot though. Again, its really a matter of perception.

We took Him out of our schools and left kids to fend for themselves.  How can they worship Him when they don't know anything about Him?  It's a sad situation.    We didn't ask to be created but we have freedom of choice. We can choose good or evil.  We can choose to turn our backs on God.  But since we know the consequences of living without God, we are free to choose to worship Him and thereby have eternal life in heaven.|`|H7L66ynJaa	God created you for His pleasure and He can do as He wishes with you.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	because he brought you into this world, and he sure as hell can take you out of it.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	He would have the power but he wouldn't have the need.

EmOnt7FIaa	I think you are best off searching the names of the individual cultures on a Yahoo! search and click on links about the culture. If that doesn't work than you should try wikipedia and see what you get. If that doesn't work, than change the language, and change it to the language of the culture you are researching and you should get more information about it. think about it, if you are looking for foods of "The Congo"for example, than you are better off changing the settings to French (because they speak french), and you can get way more information because it is actually them who are updating their wikipedia.    Good luck
k2cPibIwaa	I think most people who are homosexual would be quite happy to be left alone doing what they want, its usually people who are not homosexual who push all this behaviour, same as its usually christian people who hush Christmas as to "not offend" other races.  Its political correctness that's been pushed over the top.|`|UBJkmXVhaa	"Tolerate" implies disapproval but allowance.  Disapproval is always legal.  But as our culture has (somewhat) changed its views on homosexuality--namely, that it is not a choice, an act of defiance, or a mark of sinfulness--it is no longer socially acceptable (in many circles) to disapprove of it.      Should we simply "tolerate" Jews/blacks/immigrants/women/the disabled/(insert demographic here)?  Or should we celebrate their contributions to society, as we would any one else?  We're all created equal, after all.    EDIT: I don't think it has to do with the bedroom.  In that train of logic, people should not advertise their heterosexual marriages or a pregnancy because it implies bedroom activity.  No one is forcing anyone to watch gay pornography or listen to graphic stories.|`|x0ipxGk6aa	No, tolerance is the legally defining line in the sand.    I read the blog and the whole log's weight is built on the feeble thought that equality for the LGBTQ community is somehow "approval and appreciation" just because the author dislikes what he must legally tolerate.  Tough titty says the kitty, but the milk's still warm!  LGBTQ folks *are* just equal as anyone else!  They also make as good as or better than parents and grandparents - seeing how the bloke in your blog is losing his kids to the system, I guys they failed *and* they're straight!     We have rights that are not granted to us by other people, but by our creator and you have no legal right to stick your nose into my pursuit of happiness.  So get busy tolerating me, you bigot!  The supreme court will find on the side of liberty for all, it always has and it always will - and your hatemonging ways will die with your sick generation.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I always have to laugh a little bit at the "I don't want to know what other people do in their bedrooms."  I'd warrant that gay people feel much the same.  Homosexuality isn't just about sex, you know.  It's also about love and all the things that couples do OUTSIDE of the bedroom.    Also, I'm still waiting on studies that show that gay people cannot parent as well as straight folks.  That's right- they don't exist.  Children do need good examples of healthy male/female (as they do female/female and male/male) interactions, and they need a strong male and female presence in their lives, but those presences do not need to come from the primary caregivers.    And lastly, yes, politicians who are anti-gay do have to shut themselves up if they want to get the votes of those who are pro-gay.  But let's take a look at someone like Dick Cheney, who has to sew his lips shut on the issue of homosexuality and follows his party line, instead of being able to speak freely (given that his daughter is gay).  In other words, all politicians do it.  There are few people who get elected by being completely honest and unbudging.  Most bring in a combination of their own beliefs and what they think their constituents want to hear and what will get them elected.|`|bgmUa2ghaa	I'm not sure. As a population, the United States is a widely diverse people, with even more widely diverse opinions. It's not really "MUST approve," more that they truly are equal to heterosexuals. I don't think you should have to learn about homosexuality if you don't want to, but I think you as the asker have some sort of prejudice against LGBTs. You wouldn't be saying anything about "polite and kind . . . true opinions" etc if you didn't. Why question their equality? They're people, just like you; only difference is they chose a different lifestyle and they feel differently about sex and attraction. In some ways, they are stronger because (if they have come out of the closet) they have dealt with society's judgment (and in my opinion scapegoating).  Hope I helped :)
O3k4t0i9aa	Egypt had a highly developed view of the afterlife with elaborate rituals for preparing the body and soul for an eternal life after death. Beliefs about the soul and afterlife focused heavily on preservation of the body. The Egyptians believed the ka aspect of the soul needed to be reunited with the ba, to support the akh, the part of each being which ascends to the heavens to take its place among the stars. This meant that embalming and mummification were practised, in order to preserve the individual's identity in the afterlife.  Bodies of the dead were coated inside and out with resin to preserve them, then wrapped with linen bandages, embedded with religious amulets and talismans. In the case of royalty, the mummy was usually placed inside a series of nested coffins, the outermost of which was a stone sarcophagus. The intestines, lungs, liver, and stomach were preserved separately and stored in canopic jars protected by the four sons of Horus.The heart was left in place because it was thought to be the home of the soul. The standard length of the mummification process was seventy days.  Embalmment was reserved for a selected few in the Old Kingdom, but it became available to wider sections of society in later periods. Animals were also mummified, sometimes thought to have been pets of Egyptian families, but more frequently or more likely, they were the representations of deities. The ibis, crocodile, cat, Nile perch, falcon, and baboon can be found in perfect mummified forms. During the Ptolemaic Period, animals were especially bred for the purpose.  After a person dies their soul is led into a hall of judgment in Duat by Anubis (god of mummification) and the deceased's heart, which was the record of the morality of the owner, is weighed against a single feather representing Ma'at (the concept of truth and order). If the outcome is favorable, the deceased is taken to Osiris, god of the afterlife, in Aaru, but the demon Ammit (Eater of Hearts)  part crocodile, part lion, and part hippopotamus  destroys those hearts whom the verdict is against, leaving the owner to remain in Duat. A heart that weighed less than the feather was considered a pure heart, not weighed down by the guilt or sins of one's actions in life, resulting in a favorable verdict; a heart heavy with guilt and sin from one's life weighed more than the feather, and so the heart would be eaten by Ammit. An individual without a heart in the afterlife in essence, did not exist as Egyptians believed the heart to be the center of reason and emotion as opposed to the brain which was removed and discarded during mummification. Many times a person would be buried with a "surrogate" heart to replace their own for the weighing of the heart ceremony.    So says the great and almighty Wikipedia.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	This is a really complex question about a really sophisticated culture. you need to read some books.

The great pyramid has its four corners pointing towards the main compass points, and its height is supposedly exactly one billionth of the distance to the sun (or something like that, I'm not sure of the actual fraction but it supposedly comes out even).  The idea is that aliens built them, perhaps to use for navigation.    There's also a myth that the shape of the pyramid focusses some kind of cosmic energy to preserve things, the bodies of the pharaohs in this case, but you can make a pyramid shape to preserve flowers, keep razor blades sharp, etc.  I have even seen pyramid-shaped hats that are supposed to keep men from going bald.|`|0EmjQjf7aa	truth is thay cats ears.|`|t8os7Hqcaa	well they were built for the tombs of the Pharaohs i know they had huge labyrinths to fool grave robbers and they were a gateway into the heavens|`|921232792e8ae7c34c7818c953169f6caa	The mystery and secrets of the pyramids?

LPO8RlVdaa	Yes, Apache got it spot on, but to expand on his answer, perhaps one of the biggest pieces of evidence for this is the fact that there has been lots of actual scientific PROOF that the Sphinx dates to at least 10,000 BC, showing that the Giza plataue is at least that old too. (The pyramids may have been built on top of the plataue thousands of years later). Geologists for example have shown that the erosion on the Sphinx could only have been caused by precipitation, which only fell in enough quantities to cause this erosion around 10,000 years ago. Egyptologists (hardly experts in geology) suddenly discounted the research and stopped any further study. (Funny isn't it).     Current Egyptologists expect us to believe that the ancient Egyptians were nomadic hunters/gatherers around 10,500 BC and remained that way for thousands of years untill suddenly overnight becoming a fully fledged Pharoanic culture! Hmmm!|`|EJysS2mlaa	mike to prove what you was saying geologists have proved via the difference between sand erosion and water freezing causing damage on both the 3 pyramids at giza and the sphinx the pyramids do not contain one hyroglif so the only date due to last ice age the date for the pyramids is about 10400bc and if the date is right then it was the time of leo makes sense alion pointing to constellation of leo ps theres alot more info ie nascan spider and giza pyramids aligned at the same time in allignment with the 3 belt sfars of orion|`|QGRZUMj8aa	Yes it is.|`|UxooffHZaa	I've definitely read pseudo-archeological evidence that suggests it is.

It could all be linked back to one point!|`|soYTXBKaaa	There is a lot of evidence to suggest that civilisations existed as much as 10,000 years ago.    The trouble is, as there has not been a culture that has survived uninterrupted during that period, evidence is not clear cut in the form of calendars.    For example, ruins of towns and cities (you need a fairly developed culture to congregate in a town or city) have been found in many places which are now underwater.  The most famous are probably the Indian cities, approximately 200 miles OFFSHORE of India.  Now we know from scientific research, that that area was probably above sea level approximately 8000 years ago.   Unfortunately, the evidence is strong, but still circumstantial.    As regards to the Pyramids, and many other ruined structures around the world, a huge amount of them seem to bear some sort of astrological significance.  Because of our ability to map the movements of the stars etc, we can use that as a model for when these ruins were built, and quite often they come up with dates of between 7-10,000 years ago.    Again, the evidence is not concrete (because it may show the time period that the structure was intended to commemorate, it doesn't mean it was actually built at that time), but I think enough questions are being asked that historians need to be a bit more open minded.    If you fancy reading something, Graham Hancock has spent most of the past 15 years or so gathering evidence that civilisations are older than history suggests, and his books are fantastically readable.  He is very enthusiastic, and that comes across in his books.    He does make mistakes so don't take his word as gospel, but it's a great introduction to the subject, and it will definitely open your eyes to some historical inconsistencies.    Start with 'Fingerprints of the Gods'.

xzL2oRq9aa	Maitreya is typically pictured seated, with either both feet on the ground or crossed at the ankles, on a throne, waiting for his time. He is dressed in the clothes of either a Bhiksu or Indian royalty. As a bodhisattva, he would usually be standing and dressed in jewels. Usually he wears a small stupa in his headdress that represents the stupa of the Buddha Sakyamuni's relics to help him identify it when his turn comes to lay claim to his succession, and can be holding a dharmachakra resting on a lotus. A khata is always tied around his waist as a girdle.    In the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya is represented as a Central Asian or northern Indian nobleman, holding a 'water phial' (Sanskrit: Kumbha) in his left hand. Sometimes this is a 'wisdom urn' (Sanskrit: Bumpa). He is flanked by his two acolytes, the brothers Asanga and Vasubandhu.    The name Maitreya or Metteyya is derived from the word maitr (Sanskrit) or mett (Pli) meaning "loving-kindness", which is in turn derived from the noun mitra (Pli: mitta) in the sense of "friend".    The earliest mention of Metteyya is in the Cakavatti (Sihanada) Sutta in the Digha Nikaya of the Pali Canon.    Maitreya is sometimes represented seated on a throne Western-style, and venerated both in Mahyna and non-Mahyna Buddhism. Some have speculated that inspiration for Maitreya may have come from the ancient Indo-Iranian deity Mithra. The primary comparison between the two characters appears to be the similarity of their names. According to a book entitled The Religion of the Iranian Peoples, "No one who has studied the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyants or the coming saviour-prophets can fail to see their resemblance to the future Maitreya.[1]    Paul Williams claims that some Zoroastrian ideas like Saoshyant influenced the cult of Maitreya, such as "expectations of a heavenly helper, the need to opt for positive righteousness, the future millennium, and universal salvation". Possible objections are that these characteristics are not unique to Zoroastrianism, nor are they necessarily characteristic of the belief in Maitreya.    It is also possible that Maitreya Buddha originated with the Hindu Kalki, and that its similarities with the Iranian Mithra have to do with their common Indo-Iranian origin.    In the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, in the first centuries CE in northern India, Maitreya was the most popular figure to be represented, together with the Buddha ?kyamuni. In China, in the 4-5C "significantly, [Buddhist artisans] used the names Shakyamuni and Maitreya interchangeably (although one refers to the historical Buddha, the other to the future Buddha), indicating both that the distinction between the two had not yet been drawn and that their respective iconographies had not yet been firmly set" [2]. The cult of Maitreya seems to have developed around the same time of that of Amitbha, as early as the 3rd century AD.|`|G9VBTg47aa	It's the same concept as Jesus Christ, other than that, not a lot except for what we're "told" to believe.|`|SGSl5yeAaa	I've heard of him, I know there's a crazy organization headed by a crazy guy trying to convince people he's Jesus' second coming, but beyond that I know nothing else.

I do it anyway, like a little mule stubbornly pulling his plow uphill.    But I recently got a little jolt of inspiration in my prayer life by reframing it a little bit.    Driving to work one day I began to watch my mindset while I drove along.  My body was relaxed.  My brain was alert but not troubled.  There was just enough tension in my stomach to make me vigilent in all the morning rush hour traffic.    Then I thought:  Why can't my prayer life be like that?  Why can't my entire spiritual walk be like that?      So that night when I came home and prayed, I tried to remember that state of relaxed alertness I was in while I was driving.  It might sound funny, but it gave my prayer a little boost that was welcome.    I suggest finding a kind of paradigm like that for yourself.

WE all go througha desert place when it seems our prayers are dry and have no substance...But GOD..is still there...WE must make our petitions known to Him, ASK , Seek , Knock...untill the answers come...  Remember Daniel ? He prayed and prayed and the angel of the Lord came with an answer...but the angel had to fight through all the evil amd wickedness to get the message there....THINK about that...KEEP PRAYING and by Faith...NOT by sight    Without Faith...its impossible to please Him !!|`|ulwXFrrJaa	mix it up.  try some role playing prayers.  wear leather while you pray.  maybe bring in a third prayer.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	Just pull yourself up by your boot strings and get back into it.|`|AsyB1qLyaa	Do you read the Bible in faith daily?

The Pastor at my Church says "fake it 'til you make it." In other words, keep praying, just like you normally would (or more) and it will come back to you.

My experience & observation is that religious faith is like a slowly leaking tire -- it has to be pumped up periodically or it goes flat.    You can try to flog your emotions into high gear by whatever means your religion allows. Or you can come to terms with the fact that emotions are what your religion is selling.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	6. THE PROVINCE OF PRAYER -      Prayer, unless in liaison with the will and actions of the personal spiritual forces and material supervisors of a realm, can have no direct effect upon one's physical environment. While there is a very definite limit to the province of the petitions of prayer, such limits do not equally apply to the faith of those who pray.  Page 999|`|eO2rnf7yaa	Keep praying and worshipping God.  Love between humans is not always a simple enjoyment, but is often hard work.  Love between us and God often requires us to engage in hard work too.  Pray even when it doesn't please you.  Pray to please God.    If you want some specific help, follow the help that Jesus Himself gave us. Matthew chapter 6 verses 7-15  tells us how Jesus taught us to pray.    I have prayed those words, trying to meditate and thoughtfully reflect on the significance of each word.   When I have done this, I have always been amazed at the completeness of The Lord's Prayer.    Pray for God to guide you with His Holy Spirit.  Sometimes it might be best to pray through your own action of attentive silence.  Ask Him to guide you, then patiently listen.  Even if you can't hear Him clearly in your heart,  thank Him for even giving you life and breath to pray.     I pray now that the Peace of Jesus comes to fill you.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	When your prayer life is weak.. Im guessing you lose concentration and focus....

Prayer is nothing more than a telephone.  No one falls in love with or needs motivation to use a telephone.  We call one another to talk to each other.  If your prayer life needs a boost, then perhaps the best advice is to not worry about prayer, but to search for a deeper relationship with God.  The prayer life will follow.|`|AA11096726	Read the Psalms which if we pay attention are like eavesdropping into the prayer closet of a great saint where he pours out his heart to God.

Find some good praise and worship songs and begin your prayer time singing to Him from your heart.  In a little while you will feel yourself being naturally drawn into prayer and quiet time with the Living God, you may even feel His presence in the room with you.    Your prayer life will be electrified, and it will never be the same again...|`|bBqPja7eaa	Say to yourself daily, you are a warrior and can't turn your back on the battlefield! Think and analyze, much prayer and work is needed everywhere, pray powerfully child, that's what the Lord said last night and I know that if I don't I'll pay a huge price, we all feel that way many times, but don't lose heart, we are in very serious trouble with this new president and we need to press and pray.  Another big reason why we need to get closer to God it's because it's obvious that the time of His return is approaching we have such little time and I don't want the Lord to be ashamed of me, I want to dwell in his presence and by his side forever, I don't want to be away from his precious being, his presence his love. Isn't this plenty of reasons, I know I have to push myself much harder but if we are constantly in his presence, we will always want to be praying, get involved in the church or some time of outreach program, feeding the needy, going on a mission but do something, this will completely transform your  life, I guarantee you that, also read real prophetic websites, by Chuck Pierce and other major prophets of God.|`|1EHmi2Y1aa	Maybe your prayer life is losing steam because you are finally realizing god doesn't answer prayers, EVER, because he does not exist, Ever?

2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	I think it's only a temporary confidence.  People who have sudden wealth sometimes have that euphoria but then when they find out that money doesn't solve all their problems the lack of confidnce comes in.    Also, people then start worrying about whether someone is friendly to them because they really want to be friends or for their money.    Also, one shouldn't confuse arrogance or abuse of power with confidence.  Howard Hughes was very rich but he had all sorts of neurosis...fear of germs and whatnot.|`|AzZZuxdRaa	although it's said money doesn't make the world go round...i think it does make a person more confident. it means that you can buy whatever you want. wouldn't you feel more confident if you were dressed in louie vuitton, apple bottoms, and other name brands, rather than, old worn out raggy clothes. i no i would. any way...how do you get over it? easy..just accept the fact that you don't have a lot of money. i no sometimes it may feel embarrassing because you cant buy all the things others have....but what can you do.|`|f9yE6qAuaa	Yep!

Hashiruna  Hanasuna  Taberuna  Oyoguna  Nemuruna    polite form, you can use "-naide kudasai"  but you need to change "u" to "a".  example    Hashiranaide kudasai  NOT Hashirunaide kudasai  (NOT Hashiru shinaide kudasai because "Hashiru" is verb and shinai (not do) is also verb)    Tabenaide kudasai  NOT Taberunaide kudasai  NOT Taberu shinaide kudasai

They're in everyone's psyche, and that's why they show up in so many diverse countries across the world.    They could also be based off large reptiles like the Komodo dragon, with attributes embellished by storytellers, or be the remains of dinosaurs (like bones, etc.) that people felt the need to explain.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	I have wondered this same question for years.

ridu0Rtwaa	Acceptance of a supernatural claim tends to promote cooperative social relationships. This communication demonstrates a willingness to accept, without skepticism, the influence of the speaker in a way similar to a child's acceptance of the influence of a parent.  By encouraging this kind of behavior where the most intense social relationships occur it facilitates the lack of skepticism and deters more open minded thinking.    Just try reading a small sample of Christian postings on here!!!    Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!! Eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more. Christians are the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more - but far worse whilst they demand freedom of religion they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them!!!    Gandhi said, I like your Christ; I do not like your Christians. They are so unlike your Christ!!!!!!!

Open heart = willing to set aside skepticism and believe what one wishes were true.    At least, that is how I have seen the terms used in relation to this forum's topic.  On the topic of surgery, they mean something different.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|D9lMg7A2aa	This quote from Pascal (really !!)    In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows for those who don't... --Blaise Pascal    Your heart has to be open so that you care to see things as they really are because you can argue like it was an Olympic event otherwise.    When somebody on here tells me there can't be a God because of complications from the intersection of String Theory and the Theory of Multiverses, I ask myself "Yeah, and what moral horror is hiding in your closet !!"     ================================    Belief  21 09 2007    Man can be compelled to do a good many things. There are a good many other things he can do in a halfhearted fashion, as it were, against his will. But belief can never be halfhearted. One can believe only if one wishes to. Perhap the credibility of a given person will be revealed to me so persuasively that I cannot help but think: It is wrong not to believe him; I must believe him. But this last step can be taken only in complete freedom, and that means that it can also not be taken. There may be plenty of compelling arguments for a mans cedibility; but no argument can force us to believe him.    The unanimity of statements on this point is astonishing; and the agreement ranges all the way from Augustine and Thomas to Kierkegaard, Newman and Andre Gide. Augustines phrase from the Commentary on John is famous; Nemo credit nisi volens: No one believes except of his own free will. Kierkegaard says that one man can do much for another, but give him belief, he cannot. Newman is forever stressing, in one guise or another, the one idea that belief is something other than the result of a logical process; it is precisely not a conclusion from premises. For directly you have a conviction that you ought to believe, reason has done its part, and what is wanted for faith is, not proof, but will. And Andre Gide? In the last jottings he published after his Journals we may read these sentences: There is more light in Christs words than in any other human word. This is not enough, it seems, to be a Christian: in addition, one must believe. Well, I do not believe. Taken all together, these statements obviously mean the following: It is one thing to regard what someone else has said as interesting, clever, important, magnificent, the product of genius or absolutely true. We may feel compelled to to think and say any and all these things in utter sincerity. But it is quite a different matter to accept precisely the same statements in the way of belief. In order for this other matter, belief, to come about, a further step is necessary. A free assent of will must be performed. Belief rests upon volition (Josef Pieper, Faith, Hope, Love, p 35-36).|`|DQjAGWXQaa	Open- heart sounds like something my grandma had to have.|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	idk but both sound pretty painful.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	nothing really.

30b5fac62378b9be69757aa6b696edf4aa	Katy Perry strikes me as the kind of girl who would go to a club and make out with a girl just to get attention and then leave with a guy...the song does nothing more than perpetuate the silly new hip and cool FAD of being (rather, pretending to be I should say) bisexual and worst of all, it promotes promiscuity...neither of those two things are attractive qualities in my opinion : )|`|oVeGMNsLaa	The following lyrics:    "No I don't even know you're name, it doesn't matter, you're my experimental game"    In other words, it's perfectly fine to use people as sexual experimentation.  Not to mention that the song is also a blatant play to the phenomenon of society's love for women-women sexual intimacy, so long as the girls are deemed attractive by conventional standards and their heterosexuality is intact (i.e. she might kiss girls, but that doesn't mean anything- she would never leave or stop loving her boyfriend).    Lots of lesbians and bisexual women are sick of curious girls using them to figure out their own orientation, or worse, using them to turn on men and get attention from men.    EDIT: Yeah, that's kind of what I mean.  I mean, a guy-guy kissing contest would NOT be received well at all in a straight bar.  The only reason girl-girl kissing is is because men appreciate it.  But it's more than just that- nothing about the Katy Perry song is true for women who love other women.  It trivializes sexual exploration.  A much better song by the same name:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulYMyCq8g...|`|k3TKEOJBaa	Hello Darling! I personally love Katy Perry but the reason some gay people find it offensive is because the song is kind of premiscuous and the fact that she has a boyfriend some people straight and gay are completely monogomous to their love and think the thought of the people that are just out for a cheap thrill give us a bad name.

C7CaNLGlaa	Anime is art, and so is Manga.  The reason people tend to not like it so much is because it's become so commonplace you don't really notice it much anymore.  There is a reason for the large eyes and big orange and purple hair.  But the basic drawing style is easy to do for those who otherwise can't draw a straight line, and that's another reason Manga is so popular.      Anime = "Japanimation", Disney, Hanna Barbara, Warner Brothers, Pixar, etc. All their animated features are done by the best artists in the business.   The sketching, line work, ink and paint have to be done just right or it will not work.

If you want to attract the fae to you, you can leave them offerings of alcohol, milk, honey, sweets, bread, fruit, etc. When you leave the offering, ask the fae to allow you to form a relationship with them, and ask them to give you a sign that they accept. Keep iron or metal away from any offerings, as it's toxic to them.|`|jLL7sDILaa	I believe they exist, yes. I believe they are spirits made of the energy of the earth, plants, flowers, and such.

vNvtwuBfaa	1. Gen. 3:15 - The seed of the woman (Jesus Christ) will bruise the head of the serpent (Satan - Rev. 12:9) in accordance with Romans 16:20  2. Gen. 9:11 - God will not again bring total destruction with a flood.  3. Gen. 12:2 - God will make a great nation out of Abraham including many descendants (15:4-5) and a title deed to a particular plot of land (12:7).    There are multiple other promises given in Genesis as well.|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	i'm not sure what the 3 promise is, since i'm not familiar w/ deuteronomy.   the first 2 though are that God promises Noah he will never again destroy the earth with a flood. His rainbow is a sign of this covenant. The second is to Abram, that he will become the father of many nations. This is a prophecy that means Abram physically fathered the founders of the Arabs(ishmael) and the Israelites(Jacob). These nations were crucial to the bloodline of Jesus, shown in matthew 1.|`|qGOxMYpHaa	God will destroy the earth one day|`|VWdCAHU5aa	eat the apple n be granted freedom  produce and kill the other species  pollute this world|`|Um2tF4RDaa	I love to j.i.z.z in my pants!!!|`|EBGdlo35aa	Well, if you want the FIRST 3, here they are (no need to look all the way into Deuteronomy....)    Gen 1:29-30 God speaks to man and tells him that he has given man all seed-bearing plants for food, and animals all plants for food.  This may be more of a statement of fact than a promise, though - it doesn't "promise" anything for the future.    Gen 2:16-17 God promises Adam that if he eats from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he will die.  Definitely a promise.    Gen 3:14-19 the promises made by God as punishment for the original sin.  I guess we can group this together as a single promise - though that seems odd to me.  Certainly, if you extract the promise of 3:15 as a single promise (as 1 answer did, with an interesting interpretation not supported by Scripture), you have to consider each of the other promises separately as well.    Gen 4:7 God tells Cain about the consequences of his anger.  This seems to me to be more along the lines of advice than a promise, though.    Gen 4:10-11, though, is most definitely a promise - one in the very same vein as the promise(s) made in Gen 3.      SO, clearly we have 3 promises - at least - in the first 4 chapters of Genesis.      NOW, the *word* promise appears in the following situations:  Gen 21:1 - the promise of a son to Abraham by Sarah  Gen 28:15 - the promise to restore Jacob/Israel to the land of Abraham, and the restatement of his promise to Abraham concerning the number of his descendants.  Num 10:29 - "the Lord has promised good concerning Israel" - probably referring to the Mosaic Covenant established at Sinai    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|AA10962298	I know of only one...It says.."We're writing this book to annoy the hell out of people for the next 3000 years."|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back!|`|ttCkz39aaa	1- God moves in mysterious ways.  2- we don't have the menatal capacity to understand why god does what he does. 3-  miracles are not made from magic

Agnostics don't know for sure if God exists or not.  They haven't proven HIs existence and they haven't proven His non-existence.  They are in between. Have doubts both ways and are really sure either way.  They are comfortable with the thought that there is no higher power and they are also comfortable with the thought that there could be.  Either way, it doesn't really do anything for them.     My opinion about Agnostics is that they are teetering on the edge and are afraid to believe in God yet also are afraid to deny Him.  I would find that belief confusing and scary.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	We worship Agnos, Goddess of Agnosticism.|`|0bOSZIzJaa	It is not a religion.

Agnostics can have a wide variety of beliefs about a higher power and can believe anything about an afterlife, and generally are not organized    Literally it means "without knowledge"An agnostic is neither theist (believing in a higher power) nor atheist (not believing in a higher power).    Some atheists and theists believe but have doubts, and may call themselves agnostic atheist or agnostic theist.    I am not sure if there is a God. If there is one I think that it would be beyond our understanding. I am agnostic.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostics|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	It's not  a religion.  Technically it's not even a position on religious belief although it's often misused as if it were one.    Agnostic is a very new word invented in 1869 and we can see the originator's writings on exactly what it means.  He was trying to take the opposite stand to those who believe metaphysical questions can be answered by mystical certainty or revelation - in other words he said that people can't just "know" X god is true or false because they think it's true or false.    It is NOT a third option between belief in gods (theism) and lack of belief in gods (atheism).  Obviously enough there can't be anything between those.  If you don't have belief, you lack it.      Agnosticism answers a separate question entirely - "how can we know?".  All honest informed agnostics are either atheists or theists too, since a position on epistemology (how we know) is separate from a position on ontology (whether we believe or not).|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Someone who is unsure of what to believe.|`|2e8a9bfb5d022abc1ae72b43960c416caa	It's not a religion.

Those who are without any belief in god are called "atheist" which means "without god."    Neither atheism not agnosticism are religions, but they are belief systems. All religions are belief systems but not all belief systems are religions.|`|TY8Td3Bmaa	It means if the Pope actually told the truth, he'd have to admit he doesn't know any more than anyone else if there is a god or not.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	Agnostic is not a religion, it is a term that applies to someone who is uncertain as to whether or not there is a a God and whether or not there is such a thing as Spirituality?    For one who is uncertain, Agnostic is the best thing to be because it is honest and realistic.  The atheist is stupid because he/she believes in something he/she cannot prove doesn't exist.    Peace

WjSJBWl7aa	Spirit's don't require death in the house. I live in a haunted house also, we built it. I get new spirits often.     You are moving into teenage years and your hormones are at their peak. Spirits are attracted to high levels of hormones and they feed off them. Did you see ghosts when you were younger also?    There's nothing to worry about for now - they don't seem harmful. Try telling them out loud to leave you alone if you wish them to leave, particularily if they start making things disappear.     Be wary of the black figure however.    If you cannot seem to banish them, try getting a cat. Cat's are very sensitive to spirits. My cat always let's me know if there's a dangerous one, and she's even attacked one.    If things get progressively worse and they wont banish or they start to really scare you, if talking to your parent's doesn't work you could sage your house or pop down to a church and get an opinion from a holy man.     But if they aren't harming you, don't worry about them :) They are just lonely and lost.|`|4wLbuw1baa	I honestly, in my non trolling opinion, suggest that you see a psychiatrist.

The medium told me that I am what is called a Sensitive, someone who is sensitive to spirits, i attract them because my "vibrations" (as she put it) are on the same level of the spirits so they are drawn to me. She even talked to the guy spirit that i know is in my house, while she couldn't tell if he was attached to me or the house, she asked him what he is doing in my house and just said that he lives here. Anyways, i don't think i would be afraid, if they haven't done anything yet they're probably not "evil", however the medium i talked to also said that the spirits feed off of your attention so the more you "pay attention" to them the more likey they are to appears. As far as your house goes it might be the land, but it sounds like your are like me and attract spirits, you could google your address or town(if its not too big) and look for murders and deadly accidents and such. I don't know if your interested, but here is the website for the medium i talked to www.Debbrockmann.com     you can email her and see if she can read anything off of you, tell you who is haunting you, etc. she has lots of other ways to help you too.|`|UkOu0lagaa	Okay, First off, you are still young enough to see those things, but you say you're 13, and you were only able to hear them at first right?

Third, just because the house isn't old the land is, the land is older than you can believe..do research about it, and you can find out what has been on the land, who has died, etc.     Lastly, Don't be scared of any of this, its a gift.|`|ibMFwQoMaa	I see things too, mostly when I am just waking up or going to sleep, and this is a recognised phenomenon.

See this link, it explains it ...  http://www.unclesirbobby.org.uk/hypnogog...    They are very frightening though.  I always sleep with a small amount of light in the house, and I am 42!  I see little glowing balls of light and although I am probably in a half-asleep state, I feel awake.  I can get up, walk around, wake up other people (who cannot see the things) and follow the balls of light as they float away.  After a bit they generally press themselves against the walls and disappear.  They are very pretty but scary.    Another hallucination that I used to have involved horrible things that looked like a small person draped in a white sheet, with a black hole in the sheet over the area of the face.  I would stare them out and they would eventually dissolve.  I don't see them any more.    I've had lots of similar experiences, and it's good to know that lots of people get them.  These would explain at least some of the things that are happening to you.    My husband and I also experienced what felt like one of our pet rats climbing onto the bed.  We assumed it was the rats.  We put them in their cage for the night, but they could get out if they really wanted to (in case of fire etc).  This went on for maybe a couple of years, until we had only a few rats (no time due to children) and they were elderly and never came upstairs.  Then we realised it was not the rats, and it wasn't till then that I got scared.  One night I was lying in bed very tired.  I was pregnant and couldn't sleep because of my husband's snoring, so I decided to go downstairs and lie on the couch.  But then the thing started tugging at the bedclothes down by my feet, so I was too scared to get out of bed.  I lay there for a while, then suddenly I got angry.  I had to get up for work the next day and what with the snoring and the blanket-tugging, there was no way I could sleep.  So I sat up suddenly, leaned over the end of the bed and hissed "F**k off!" The tugging stopped and it never happened again to either of us, so maybe I should hire myself out as an exorcist!|`|yCTxg4t5aa	Theres no reason to be freaked out, they can't hurt you unless you let them. It just means your mind is open, Ghosts and spirits are attracted to some kinds of people because of their strength. Often they just have something to say to you, i would suggest that next time something happens ask them what they want. Or alternativly if you dont want to be seeing them you can banish them from your house http://www.ehow.com/how_4542194_banish-g...
XzEGvaXjaa	How old are you? What sort of life do you live? 'Cause if you're young and/or privileged, then you've probably yet to learn how HORRIBLE the world can be. Death is not a punishment when you're living in a world like this, especially if you were a good Christian. Death and going to heaven where you will be in eternal peace with the Lord is the reward for a hard life of suffering trials, ridicule, and ignorance.    In other words, its indeed part of his plan. Did you ever hear the saying "Its always the good men who die young?" and stuff like that? It seems like a horrible thing when you look at it in a purely secular way, but when you think of it in a religious way, its hope. Have you ever seen those old people who are incredibly sick and you feel so sorry for them because you know they're suffering and you just want to know when it will end? When good Christians die, they are (hopefully) spared from such a torturous end.    I would hope that God would take me young before I have to suffer like that. I'm not saying that you should live only looking forward to death (I do, but I'm very pessimistic and cynical), but when you see those around you die, just know that its always a good thing if they were truly good Christians (and make up **** if they weren't! lol. J/k...not really). This helped me to cope with my grandmother's death and it will help me cope with my mother's (though I hope that won't happen any time soon since I still need her with me).|`|u4liwDhAaa	That is a question for the ages!  When it's your time you go.  That sounds like a silly response but it's true.  We are all here for whatever reason.  When we have fulfilled that reason or if we have been really bad it's over.  A car crash for instance means our time is over.  That's my catholic upbringing I guess.  It's a shame that good people die.     Your question is not silly.  Don't ever say you are sorry for wanting to gain more knowledge!|`|3m00lxxuaa	My speculation is the same as yours I would say. For those who died early, if they really were a true believer, then ya, it was probably their time to go. That does seem to happen every now and then, but God's plans and ways are greater than ours, so we can't always expect to understand them.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Everyone has to die. Even the Son of God had to die.    Only by shedding this mortal flesh can we commune freely with God in heaven.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	Everybody dies sooner or later.  Death isn't the end.  It's a commencement to something better.    I don't think anybody has "their time" to go, though.  God gave us brains and hearts and free will.  God doesn't cause or prevent accidents:  If somebody of his own free will swerves into me tomorrow in traffic, I might die.  Not because it was my time, but because accidents happen.    Until I do die, I'm not going to worry about it.  I'm going to live my life the way Jesus said to:  loving other people and God to the best of my ability.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Christians believe they go to eternal life with GOD when they die.

Ecclesiastes 3:2 "a time to be born and a time to die"    From dust we are created and from dust we shall return.

We die because we inherited sin from Adam.  Death is the payment for our Adamic sin.  If we die young, it is not because God did not protect us, it is because we are at the wrong place and at the wrong time.    "That is why, just as through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned. " -- Romans 5:12.    "I returned to see under the sun that the swift do not have the race, nor the mighty ones the battle, nor do the wise also have the food, nor do the understanding ones also have the riches, nor do even those having knowledge have the favor; because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all." -- Ecclesiastes 9:11.|`|bOiAHI8paa	here's a little statistic for you ten out of ten christians die.|`|Bhf88RGyaa	it rains on the just and the unjust. the bible says that there is a time for everything. a time for joy and a time for sadness, a time for pain and a time for healing, a time for life and a time for death.|`|0hQyClksaa	I agree with Jon, but you also have to remember that "Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His saints"  God longs for us to be in His presence so He can finally hold us in His arms, and vice versa.    God longs for us, and when His plan for our lives is over, I think He will call us home.  Sometimes, however, death is purely circumstantial, He knows it's gonna happen, but doesn't interfere to prevent it even though it's not His timing.|`|YQMCVuFiaa	"good Christians"    This is where you went wrong.|`|O3U7aLCDaa	He often feels that people are ready to go to heaven.  The key to going to heaven is to believe in god so some people who already believe in god with all their hearts are ready for heaven.  P.S. Christianity is awesome!|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	The apostle Paul says in Philippians "To live is Christ, to die is gain". This means that either way we benefit. The longer we live, the more we get to spread the Word of God to others around us. To die, we get to see Christ that much sooner. There is no sure explanation to why God takes people to be with him at an early age. Sometimes the trial strengthens the people left behind, to be better witnesses. Sometimes it is just because they had served there purpose, and earned their reward. Just remember, no matter what others say, God is a good God , and he would never do something that would harm his child. Everything is part of His plan, even if at the time we don't understand why.|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	That's sounds like a good way to put it. I guess that it was their time, even if it was young.   Another way that I see it, no matter how ridiculous that it may sound, is that bad things happen to balance out good things, and good things happen to balance out bad things. How would we know what's good if we didn't know what's bad, and what's bad if we don't know what's good? Now it's your job to find out what you consider good and bad. Cheers!|`|PmG0Isnnaa	That is a big question, but here is a short answer.     Death first entered the world when sin entered the world through Adam and Eve.  God warned Adam and Eve that they would die if they ate from the one tree in the garden that God forbade them from eating.  They did and fell under the curse of sin which is death.  We have all inherited this sin and disobey God's law ourselves, so we all are also under the curse of death.     But God provided a way of escape.  He sent His Son, Jesus, to live a perfect sinless life in our place and then to die in our place on the cross, taking upon himself the curse and punishment of our sin.  All who believe in Jesus have forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life.  So, to answer your question, although everyone, even Christians, die, only Christians will live forever with God, in heaven.

It suggests a nebulous dim puff of star dust lost in the blaze of the Milky Way.   Properly the Jew ought hardly to be heard of; but he is heard of, has always been heard of.   He is as prominent on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk.   His contributions to the world's list of great names in literature, science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also way out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers.   He has made a marvellous fight in this world, in all the ages; and has done it with his hands tied behind him.   He could be vain of himself and be excused for it.   The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendour, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek and Roman followed, and made a vast noise, and they are gone; other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished.   The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmity of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, and no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind.

This means that Jews don't live life in perpetual anxiety and fear of being eternally abandoned. Scientific studies have shown the mental disorders that a fear of eternal hell has caused for some people, and Jews don't suffer from this (instead they're more likely to be the psychiatrist analysing these people).    This allows Jews to focus on exploring and understanding this life more than ones which are focused on an afterlife, which probably helps to account for why Jews have excelled in so many areas like the sciences, philosophies, arts and other areas more than probably any other group in the world (on a per capita basis) despite often living under discriminatory laws of the majority societies they lived in.|`|qs8qPhEUaa	For me, the best things about Judaism are:  1) the very strong sense of community - anywhere in the world I go, I'll always feel welcome and comfortable with other Jews.  2) the feeling of truth... it's the mother of all the main religions in the world and I feel confident it it's validity  3) the spiritual feelings and meaning infused in everyday tasks....|`|29X6EEsKaa	Lobbyists in US congress, Seinfeld.. etcetera...|`|pSS1xPknaa	Judaism respects all religions so actually discourages conversion.

This means Jews do NOT seek converts or try to convince anyone that Judaism is "best," so your question is somewhat oxymoronic.  On the other hand, that, in itself, might be one of the "best" things about it.  There are no "best" religions. Religion and spirituality (not the same thing) are personal choices, based on what resonates with yourself.  If you have to "convince" someone of your choice, then it is not a good one.

Mx07dTipaa	Today, red hair is most commonly found at the western fringes of Europe; it is associated particularly with the people of the British Isles (although Victorian era ethnographers claimed that the Udmurt people of the Volga were "the most red-headed men in the world").[6]    Redheads constitute approximately four percent of the European population.[7] Scotland has the highest proportion of redheads, as 13 percent of the population has red hair and approximately 40 percent carries the recessive redhead gene.[8] Ireland has the second highest percentage; as many as 10 percent of the Irish population have red, auburn, or strawberry blond hair.[9] It is thought that up to 46 percent of the Irish population carries the recessive redhead gene. Red hair reaches frequencies of up to 10 percent in Wales.[10] In England, the county of Cornwall, the far north, near the Scottish border, and the counties of Nottinghamshire and South Yorkshire also have significant proportions of redheads.[citation needed]    In the United States, anywhere from two to six percent of the population is estimated to have red hair. This would give the U.S. the largest population of redheads in the world, at 6 to 18 million, compared to approximately 650,000 in Scotland and 420,000 in Ireland.    Red or reddish-tinged hair is also found in other European populations particularly in the Nordic and Baltic countries as well as parts of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Germany, Russia and South Slavic countries.    The Berber populations of northern Algeria and Morocco have occasional redheads.[11]    In Asia, darker or mixed tinges of red hair can be found sporadically from Northern India, northern Middle East (such as Iran, Lebanon and the countries of the Levant) and in rare instances in Japan[12] and the South Pacific. Red hair can be found amongst those of Iranian descent, such as the Pashtuns, Persians, Lurs & Nuristanis.    In Argentina people with red hair also make up a portion of the population, due to British and Irish immigration during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.[13]|`|q9PVawNyaa	Scotland. In fact Scotland is the country most associated with redheads. It's not an Irish thing at all.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	The Berbers of North Africa sometimes have red hair.    Scotland has a higher number of natural redheads than Ireland.  The Scots settled in Scotland from Ireland (the Scots were actually Irish).  In Ireland the red genes mingled with crew members of the Spanish Armada who settled in Ireland which resulted in Irishmen with black hair.  In Scotland the red genes mingled with the Invading Vikings who had blonde or red hair.  So many Irish have black hair, and many Scottish people from the Highlands of Scotland have blonde hair.  However red + blonde is more likely to result in red hair, than red + black, therefore there are more natural redheads from Scotland.|`|C7CaNLGlaa	Finland and even Israel.

14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	Religion is a belief in something, supposedly Spiritual in nature, and most religions were begun by followers of a Saint, Master, or mystic whose Spirituality drew people to him/her.    At the death of the Saint, Master or mystic, if another is not "initiated" by that Saint, Master or mystic, then what is created to honor that mystic will be an honest attempt to capture in physical plane words an Esoteric Reality that cannot be conveyed in words.    Religions in other words speak of a Spiritual Reality that was taught by someone at one time, but the religion no longer is in touch with that Spiritual Reality.    Peace|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	A religion is a way of life based on rules set by divine edict.  For the Christian, there are 2 primary commandments:  1) Love GOD with your whole mind, body, & soul.  2) Love your neighbour (one another) as yourself.|`|UV6osJh8aa	A religion contains:  1. Belief in the divine  2. Belief in the ability to connect with the divine.  3. A spiritual journey to bring you into and sustain connection with the divine, laid out in instructions for practice.  4. Core beliefs which may be guidelines for further meditation and self-exploration of deeper reality, or which may be very strict.  5. Festivals, observances and remembrances, typically.    It will also have fanatics, middle-ground and non-commital members.  There will be branches, schisms, varying schools of thought.  In religions that encourage exploration and thought, other schools of thought are respected, but those that are more doctrinally strict tend to be highly intollerant of varying beliefs within the religion.  Nonetheless, you will almost always find varying schools of thought within any given religion.|`|0hQyClksaa	Religion is mans worst enemy.  Religion is a man-made system of faith that has been designed by the enemy of our souls, and instituted by men, to keep us from the Living Way of following the Living God.    Relationship is what God created you for and what He is longing for from you...not religion.  Christianity in it's unadulterated form is this relationship.|`|OQdPzl15aa	Religion is man's attempt to become closer to God, through various rituals and practices.  It completely focuses on the works of man.    Funny how God hates religion and is only interested in relationships. It even says in the Bible that the only religion God accepts as pure and good, is taking care of widows and orphans.      Man could use all the religion he wants, but at the end of the day, "it is not by works, but by faith; lest any man should boast."|`|a5Z1xfejaa	a cult|`|Wr2CP732aa	Mind control

Consider the gay and lesbian community. They are viewed as annoying by some, because they are so fervent about their beliefs. They want everyone who doesn't agree with them to start NOW! :)     I'm a Christian myself, and I feel it is my duty to spread the good news.. It's a gift that is worth sharing with everyone I meet. Something life changing and amazing! I try not to be annoying and obnoxious though. I share it through my daily life and actions.. not just my words. I do understand how some go about it the wrong way, because they don't know any better.     A lot of people pushing their beliefs are going about it in an "annoying way", and you're right.. sometimes it pushes people farther away. I hope I'm never guilty of this.. but just so you know.. It's just because they are so excited/concerned, that they are anxious to get the "news" of whatever it is out to others. It's not that they are trying to be annoying. :)|`|Lgmg6uYKaa	They may be annoying, but most likely they're the one's paying for you to drop out of public school and waste your life, so that in return, they can once again pay for your illegitimate child who will drop out of high school and so on and so forth.

I also know that if I approach someone who does not share that opinion that he/she will be put off by any reference to God, His Deity,  and the fact that God's way is the only way to salvation.    Most of us search diligently to find some other way, at one time or another, and if we are still in that frame of mind, we will be annoyed and worse.  It is not until we allow the Holy Spirit to witness to our spirit that we can receive the Truth.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	They're overly religious and believe that they have to "educate" you about whatever religion they have.  I agree with you completely.  You believe what you want and let me believe what I want is my opinion on the matter.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	Because they're ignorant. There's no other reason than that. Even if we accept what we believe as the absolute truth, that doesn't mean we have to force our truth on everyone else. Same thing goes for atheists. Its not anyone's place to tell anyone else what is the absolute truth unless their beliefs are somehow hurting someone. We are just humans; we are limited in what we can perceive and experience and its just sheer stupidity to assume that we can have the answers to everything. So its stupid to assume that we can tell people whether they are right or wrong in their beliefs when we don't truly know anything ourselves. Logic is inherently flawed because humans are flawed. Science is inherently flawed because humans are flawed. Even religious doctrines are inherently flawed because humans are flawed. Whether God or whoever wrote the doctrine, it still had to pass through flawed human hands time and time again. With everything we do being "flawed", its just plain ignorant to assume that your beliefs are suddenly flawless.    Humans are just ignorant creatures. Ignore the stupid ones and live your life the way you want. I'm a Christian but you will never find me pretending like I know everything there is about the world and thus, you will never find me trying to tell you you're wrong. I don't know if you're wrong or not but quite frankly, I don't care. I don't see why anyone cares...especially Christians. The Bible says to preach the word, but the Bible also says if they won't believe they just won't believe, no matter what you do or say. So why force it?|`|ttCkz39aaa	Actually i feel sad about most relgious folks who are so caught up in their beliefs,  If they could only understand that what they believe to be absolute facts are beliefs and theories,  (Whether true or not), They most likely wouldn't feel the need to have others believe as they do.      I asked a question for the religious folks who understand that their belliefs about god and the bible are just that beliefs to spread that word to the religious fanatics who swear that they know for absolute fact that god and the bible are true,   And got only 1 single answer  from a guy who didn't understand the question lol|`|ntdhO8wsaa	They're annoying to you because you let them annoy you.

The thing is that until the Christians came up from Rome and Greece, there was no "written language" so to speak. While there were rune alphabets they were not used in the writing of lore and stores. Hence the Christians wrote it and Christonanized it, much as they did with the Eddas and most other stories.    Don't be too critical.

bBqPja7eaa	It is a very difficult thing one has to deal with on a daily basis, I went through all that for several months with this nasty corporation and finally I was about to quit, but decided to stay home one day, called in sick, because I was truly getting sick from all the disgusting actions and demeanor of people on the floor and many different things, too long to tell all, but was absolutely miserable and every day was terrible and only kept on getting worse,  especially after being self employed for over a decade, finally it sort of became a mutual decision and I left the company as the so called manager or supervisors just wouldn't address any of these delicate issues, I figured if I didn't leave It'd probably cost me a lot, well being and health.

I know it's easier said than done, but if you confront, things could escalate into a situation you wish didn't happen.    If someone's giving you a hard time - and it's affecting your work performance -  document. Date, time, place, person's full name and title, behavior/words. Talk to your supervisor and give him/her a copy of your documentation, including the date given to same. By documenting you're "confronting" the person in print-which beats verbal confrontations.    First day at work - just be yourself. Carry yourself in a professional manner, uphold your work ethics and treat others the same way until or unless they prove otherwise, then just ignore them. Be friendly, but at the same time, be observant. Quietly watch who's friendly with whom and remember: because you don't see people talking together does not mean they're not calling each other on weekends/holidays/after work/vacations.    Best.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You remain courteous, soft spoken and professional, and if anyone gives you a hard time you go up to them, get in their face and say, in a very soft, low voice, "Verbal abuse and harassment are illegal in the workplace, please do not force me to go to HR and file a grievance against you." Then walk away.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	On your first day at work you should be friendly, respectful of others, listen closely, and try to learn your new job.  That will show confidence.

Now as to the first part of your question; never confront people who are giving you a hard time regardless of the time you've been there.  What you do is go to your boss, or their boss or the H.R. department, explain the situation and ask for some help.

1TuIuuXdaa	No. A semicolon is used to link two sentences without a conjunction, or as a sort of super-comma.    For example:  I will bring with me: my lemon cake; my suitcase, which is brown; an elephant; two children, called John and Jane; and a banana.    Or:  It's a shame that he died so young; he was an excellent actor.    What you need in your sentence is a colon.|`|Fs1bgP4Uaa	No. For a semicolon to be used correctly, it has to separate 2 complete sentences. You can use it instead of a full stop as long as the sentences are closely related.     For example: 'Sarah is going to the park tomorrow; she loves peaceful places'.    For your sentence, I think you could use these:     I know who will be there by my side when I'm ill or when I'm in a time of need: my mother.     Or     I know who will be there by my side when I'm ill or when I'm in a time of need - my mother.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	No that's not correct.  On either side of a semi colon, you must have a complete sentence.

When I see racism, and can interject, I try to fix things.  When I hear other parents talking about the "mexican population", I try to make sure they aren't talking "smack" about them, or lumping in the others from the district that are from OTHER countries (cause no one really wants to be mistaken as a Mexican, when they are a proud Salavadoran, any more than a New Zealander wants to be mistaken for an Australian, or a Canadian for a [shudder] American!).

Anyways, I don't know if this helps you or not but yeah.    *Anonymous*|`|nsEbwHNsaa	I am very much against racism. I personally think it is horrible, and I am ashamed to live in a place were that takes place everyday. People are people, whether they are white, black, purple, blue or green.

I'll tell you why, because we live in a society full of judge mental people. This comment could go on and on, but I am going to end it.

There are many other effective means of birth control, and I don't think abortion should be used just because someone didn't want to take the time to have save sex, with that said, they are not 100% and if they fail the solution should be there for the woman.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	It depends on what your arguments are going to be.  A thesis is merely a one or two-sentence summary of the points you will be making and the conclusion you will draw in your paper, put at the end of your introduction.  So if, for example, you decide to focus on the argument that a fetus is a human being, your thesis might look like this:    "Fetuses are not merely a collection of cells, and as such, abortion cannot possibly be a legal option in a civilized society."    Or let's say you wanted to focus on how abortion isn't good because it is used as a form of birth control:    "Abortion is completely preventable and as such, its legalization and cultural acceptance only encourages irresponsibility amongst those who see it as not a last resort, but a way to have their cake and eat it, too."    Or you might argue it in terms of civil rights:    "Simply put, to interpret "the right to privacy" as the right to one's body- and not the right of no improper searches and seizures- is clearly an example of judicial legislation and a circumvention around our government's natural and time-honored tradition.  If abortion cannot be legalized through the appropriate channels, it has no place in our laws."    And so on.  Your thesis cannot be written until you know what you're going to be writing about.  "Against abortion" is far too broad and vague.

hwQoOSfRaa	It's from neanderthal days.  Men were born to hunt and gather, hence your liking for bangs, crashes, bombs etc...anything like taht lol.  Women are born to (and I'm waiting to get the thumbs down for this) cook, nurture, teach and talk.  It's all in the brain. We are the carers, men are the providers.  We needed to multi task to look after and raise the future population, men needed to provide food.  Both equally important in different ways.

I believe its important to get to know the person well before making the final decision so it would be necessary to spend some time with them before marriage also i wouldnt really say its the same thing as a love marriage its kinda assisted if you get my drift =)   x  x  x|`|A0RYAnFTaa	Well the way all the Muslims I know including my parents, cousins, family friends, ect do it is by arranged. But hold on first what happens is that your parents pick a few people out and let YOU decide out of there choices. Then after you pick you just get to know each other more and then get married.|`|ou20w5sCaa	Bismillahi Rahmani Rahim     Salaam Alaikum wa Rahmatullah    I met my husband over the internet, lol.  I met him within a week of us finding each other online, as I happened to be in his city on vacation.  We met with chaperones - a married couple who are friends of his (now ours).  After my visit, we corresponded and talked on the phone.  We married about four months after we met.      I am a revert so I didn't have a Muslim family to help me in my search for a husband.  Also, I had been Muslim for several years, was over 30, and was pretty well versed on my rights as a woman.  I knew what I wanted in a husband.  Alhamdulillah, we got to know each other with our visit and then by talking over the phone, and we've been going strong, ten years and four kids later, mashAllah.    I think it's ESSENTIAL to get to know the person you plan to marry.  As long as you stay within the bounds of Islamic etiquette, there should be no issues, inshAllah.  And Allah knows best.    Fi Aman Allah,    Nancy Umm Abdel Hamid|`|5ofS2qQYaa	not married yet...but I think yea..we'd date  but it wouldn't be the American Standard of dating...    it would be like this:  in a public place, with a guardian on the side to make sure I'm not so driven by the desire to have a relationship that I don't act like myself or fall for the wrong guy, and for a pre-determined amount of time so we don't stray from the topic at hand, and we both have to have the goal of finding a spouse for marriage in mind...not just playing around    that would be a pretty cool date  you can figure out faster whether a dude is good for you or not when both have the goal of marriage in mind  and a guardian helps make sure you don't stray and avoid the main topic    :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|b1znvwnJaa	Not married ... but want to know my husband before I marry him like wazgud stated. :)|`|Wgsl0hVLaa	dating is haraam, arranged marriage is the only halal way for someone to get married.    The Prophet (peace be upon him) also reportedly said, "Whenever a man is alone with a woman, Satan (Shaytan) is the third among them" (Tirmidhi).  When young people are getting to know each other, being alone together is a temptation toward wrongdoing.     Hadrat Umar (RA) related that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "Not one of you should meet a woman alone unless she is accompanied by a relative (mahram)" (Bukhari/Muslim).

P544Sbmqaa	Well most counselors arent about telling the couple what is right and whats wrong, rather they are about helping the couple explore what they want to do and how to make their relationship work.  I have no idea if that specifically is true or not, but if its what the couple wants to do, the counselor's job is to help them work through whatever they are going through, not tell them what they can or cannot do as a couple.    And actually, swinging is thriving everywhere.  You would be literally shocked if you knew the couples in your own area that participated.  Its HUGE.  Some couples can do it and be ok, some cant.|`|eeWY8vbkaa	Whatever. Marriage is between two people a man and a woman. Period. Nowhere does it say that you should add to the mix.

tQsxsuNPaa	Work?  Well, YOU have to do the work.    Seriously, though, it's a simple flashcard system, which teaches you basic phrases that travelers need, and a couple of odd things, like animals.  Of course, as a traveler, you're going to WANT to be able to say cockroach, because you might just have to complain to the management of your hotel, or butterfly, because you might be interested in the name of that pretty blue one that just flew by, but it has things like what direction, hello, goodbye, how much?  things like that.      I have no idea what you get when you pay for the program, but that's about all that is on the free one.  So, yeah, it can be helpful to know those phrases, and if you practice often enough, you will learn some language.   I don't think you're going to become fluent off the basic set, but you'll learn some key phrases to get around.  If you are visiting often, you'll learn more!
a1Ngi39Xaa	Umm, I also have a problem with procrastinating...    I will get back to you later!    Just kidding.  Honestly when I was in college I used to type things up, just for the repetition factor, and it helped get it into my brain.  I had my bf quiz me on stuff.  Made up index cards to study from.      Remember to take breaks - stop and take a nap maybe.  They say that helps you to get the stuff you just remembered to stay in your brain.    Stop and reward yourself with a snack or a phone call to a friend.    Listen to music while you are studying if it helps you.    You'll get there!!|`|s6b3RnsWaa	I know what you mean.

My homeboy is black & puerto rican (light skin), and we're interested into each other and not going out yet! what he told me how he likes asian girls is because they're clean, small, and i guess it's rare since the asian population in the United States isn't so many so it may seem like a competition! Besides, i'm Asian myself, like to please my guys, so that's probably why, but asian women can be bitchy at times. We're smart, and i usually hold high self-esteem and self confidence for myself so i guess that's what guys like. Oh btw, white guys never hitted on me, only black, hispanics, and asians! don't know why tho, i'm not even into the hip hop culture or anything.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	first of all, even though we all know it, I want to state that this is about generalities and trends, not specifically true in all cases.  There are nasty ugly Asians and angelic beautiful White girls. But the trend is the contrary.  There are a few issues that contribute.  First, Asians are less likely to be overweight.  That is important. No Fat Chicks, mean though it may sound, seems to be hardwired in men from birth.  I think it is a genetic preference.  second, Asians have clearer skin.  Not all, but by and large.  And when they have pimples and whatever, it contrasts less, so it is not as noticeable.  Third, Asians are more respectful.  They will actually listen to the guy they are with.  Fourth, Asian culture did not have "dating" until very recently.  Instead, they had courtship.  The purpose was to marry.  That changes all the rules in ways that make the woman much more pleasant to be around.  You are not just a step on her pathway, you are her destination.  Now, the particular girl may not think that way, but the culture she came from is still heavily influenced by that idea, and it shows.|`|AQxqS7Kyaa	Because we're natrually slim and small.|`|LT210d3Taa	cuz we're asian!

(8) And they give food out of love for Him to the poor and the orphan and the captive"  (this was sent because Imam Ali (as), Fatima (as), Imam Hasan (as) and Imam Hussain (as) had fasted for 3 days but each time when it was time for iftar a person in needed came to their house and asked for help and they gave their food to them)      3:61:  "But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and our near people and your near people, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars."

When i did, somehow, it was more due to the other person. Like they weren't interested in chatting or something.    I wish i knew the details a bit much as different types of situations has different answers.    In an elevator at work, learn to accept silence as a good thing. Smile, maybe even a light nod, and then just continue to think about the things you need to do.    Silence while on a date. What does it mean? Was there tension and the date not going well? figure out if there's a way to get out of the date quicker, nicer for both of you that way. You can always ask questions, but if they give one syllable answers, you can ask a follow up to it.     If it's after someone said something nasty to another person, it all depends. Mostly i'd say, i think that was over the line and look at the person who said the nasty thing. If they try to say something more, i'd say, i think we heard enough, no one wants to hear more. this will normally end it and people can start going back to their own business.     If two people you don't know are fighting, you can walk away. Or you can stop listening and hving the moment with them and go back to doing what you were doing in the first place.     Silence doesn't have to be awkward in the least. find out why it bothers you so and learn to accept silence can be a good thing.     If you simply want to learn how to chat, it's not always an easy thing to learn. One must be quick witted to make it work and have some knowledge on most things.     Worse comes to worse, laugh and say, oh i hate these awkward silences, i never know how to handle them or what to say. This normally lightens the mood and the other person will probaby admit to feeling the same way.|`|O7SshRl6aa	Silence is just silence.  There is nothing awkward about it.  Not every moment needs to be filled with sound.  The next time you are confronted with silence, just let it be.|`|8b8e79868b256ddb37674bc3afecbbcfaa	I usually say something random lol. There's this little creeper in my class, and he's kind of attached to me. When I talk to him, it's a little awkward though because I'll say something and he'll just stare at me for like 10 seconds. I tried to break the ice and I told him he has nice eyes, and he said, "Yeah, girls usually tell me that." Maybe that was the wrong thing to say because now he's really clingy O.o|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	Come up with some conversation starters before hand.|`|PZjmWdW8aa	find someone where when there is silence there is no awkwardness.
5ofS2qQYaa	I think an email is a good idea  that way he won't feel the need to be defensive and he won't feel embarassed in front of others...just in front of himself  and he'll take his own sweet time contemplating what's going on  also, this way he can decide to take your advice w/o seeming like he's listening to you b/c he can just as easily say that he trashed the email, but he might've read it anyways and taken it to heart    an email is good...it'll get attention insha'allah and it can be taken more seriously in private than if you were to confront him in public    bring up w/e you think is neccesary I guess     :)    Allah(swt) knows best|`|VGsSxgvjaa	Peace.  Find out what kind of a crowd he mixes with, you'll get a hint on why the sudden change of character. Also, the solution lies within the family being strong enough to resist his change and try to redirect him toward people who will be of good influence to him.

You can send the email even without islamic quotes he needs to know the way hes behaving is just plain wrong. Just speak your mind he needs to know that he will probably end up losing those closest to him if he carries on behaving that way.  Hope this helps sis im pretty depressed myself =(   x  x  x|`|4c37af8f5ace80a9c4a1a84872ff8068aa	i think you should forget about emailing him, and you and any other close family members sit him down and talk to him, or maybe he would feel more comfortable if your mum/dad asked him what has happend to change him.    there is obviously something happening in his life to make him so short tempered, and change so much, but it's a delicate thing to actually find out what it is. i know because my brother is like that, and any mention of anything to him he goes crazy, but then he's calm and like a normal person.    just dont confront him on it head on, do it with thought, think about it for a few days befor you rush into it, it might turn out to be something that you didnt expect.

The ancient Greeks were a perfect example of this - lots of these men were heterosexual, yet enjoyed homosexual sex.

Look at prisons. There's a lot of gay sex (sex between two people of the same sex), but a large number of them are NOT straight. Why do they do it?  Because they're horny. They need sex and they can't really get it any other way. Think about masturbation - a person can get off WITHOUT someone else being there. Why? Because of the feeling of stimulation to their genitals - duh. Whether a guy sucks a penis or a girl sucks a penis makes no difference - said person is still being blown.    Straight men can have sex with men or fool around with them. But they think about women to get them aroused, only want to have lasting relationships with women, and VASTLY prefer sex with women over men.    They're NOT bisexual. Why? A true bisexual would date, marry, and be together with either sex. A straight man won't date/become life partners with another man. He's not attracted to them.

nisfxpXHaa	I think your reaction is pretty normal. After all these years you now know something about your friend that has the potential to make his life harder. Your probably wondering what life has in store for him and how this may affect your friendship as well.     Yes your both only 17, but you more than likely already had certain things worked out in your mind. Like going to college, and getting married etc. etc. and in your dream you probably had your best friend doing those things as well. Now you don't know how these things will unfold.    All I can tell you is to continue to love him and treat him as you always have. I don't think he just expects you to know how to handle all of this at once. Realize that although your friend has accepted that he is gay, it doesn't mean that he has it all figured out either. He is still making his way in this life just as your are. Be open with your friend, you may find he has the same questions as you. Let him know you will always be there for him, will always support him, and that you are still here for the long haul.     Make new dreams with your friend, yes many things have changed but I'll bet more things have remained the same then you both realize right now.    Your a good friend.

Don't worry!   Change is always scary and when people we thought we knew show us a whole new side to their character it is a bit strange for a while. Then you get used to it and your friendship will return to normal status quo again.  I had a big surprise when this guy I met at couple of events a year , missed one and arrived looking a bit different. I was shoved to one side and told do you knows he's had a sex change operation. No and there he was a woman, I had about two second warning. So I did the great British thing of not noticing and it was cool we hung out for the weekend . However, some guys were really nasty to him, when I wasn't there, or I would of freaked, and they really upset him. As if he hadn't got enough probs with family and work friends. I just say treat your friend like you always did, he's been gay all the time you've known him and it has never bothered you before!|`|eMUbdnG1aa	when i came out to m friends it seemed this way. but if youguys are as close as you guys say you are then things should be fine and the weirdness will go away.|`|EUcav3etaa	sorry my reply may not help,my "friends" tha i came out to doesnt say much of what they think/how they felt.so i felt somewhat saded...but ur a gd frd.u stood by and try to comfort him etc....    maybe ur jus having initial shocks?u said u tot he MIGHT be gay but stil not sure right?not until he came out to u that is....maybe all u need is some time for 'adjusment' to his coming out?|`|EK7mJWPZaa	its no suprise because you knew him for so long....its kind of suprising when you find out something so big about a person you thought you knew so well.....dont worry about it....you will get over it....im about to come out to my bestfriend next week....i hope she is as accepting as you|`|c3Z0thJkaa	It's natural to feel a little awkward and cautious at first, but I believe you will soon realize that your friendship with one another will ultimately triumph!

I've felt momentary awkwardness around friends I thought were straight, but later revealed themselves to be gay; just as I've had the very same feeling around friends I thought were gay, who later revealed themselves to be straight.    Something you thought you knew about a close friend has changed, and in a way it's a bit like getting to know them all over again. In time you'll realize he's the same person you've known all along, and everything will be fine.|`|PuWucUs3aa	weird.|`|FgaBo4Eraa	Good for you for being so accepting, it's probably just the pressure of adjusting to this. Even if you suspected, hearing him say it would still be a shock. I'm sure you'll stay being a great friend.    Everyone should have a friend like you :)|`|kVcy1VRyaa	Finding out something new and unexpected is bound to rock the boat- even if it doesn't affect the person that found out directly. You've discovered something new about your best friend that will change his life forever. You are right- this event will make your friendship stronger. You're simply shocked at this present moment- I wouldn't worry; it'll pass.     When I told a couple of my friends that I was gay, they looked visibly shocked- and they also mentioned to another of my closest friends that it shocked them as well.   After a couple of days, we were back to normal. They didn't (and don't) hate homosexuals, they were just shocked and worried that me telling them that I was homosexual would impact upon our relationship somehow. It didn't.  Your friend doesn't want things to be weird between you and him; and I doubt that you want things to be strange between him and you either.   The best thing to do now would be to calm yourself and allow yourself to accept his homosexuality. After you have gotten over the shock of it all, things will be 'back to normal' as it were.
Jvsc2lQkaa	You're completely brainwashed.  You don't see this surah for what it is, double-speak, backing and filling on Muhammad's part when he changed the direction from Jerusalem to Mecca, because the jews that he was courting rejected him as the messiah?    The Quran without the Sunnah is meaningless.  Show me where in the Quran does it explain how to perform the hajj, say the daily prayers, pay the zakat, or observe ramadan?  It doesn't!  You need the sunnah for these, because Muhammad assumed that all his followers culturally understood the pillars of Islam, since they were nothing but repackaged polytheistic meccan practices.      Then you have the problem of deciding which sunnah to select, and which to reject, because there are some pretty absurd and objectionable things in there.  But wait, if you make a selection, then you are exercising cafeteria religion, choosing the best and rejecting the bits you don't like.  If you do that you can excuse ANYTHING.    Quite a problem, all caused by following a cult leader.|`|4ViYw6Hxaa	100% true.|`|XCTUmHPLaa	Rejecting hadith ia one step towards rejecting Quran       Quran's best tafsir is authentic hadith     so when u rejected the hadith then u can do any interpretation of quran which suite your interests|`|IxoBFCpTaa	I have dealt with these submitters a while now.

But, in fact, it was built in 72 AH (691 CE) by the Umayyad Ruler, Abdul Malik bin Marwan, about 60  years after the exalted Messenger passed on. The First Sanctuary was nothing but Kaba in Makkah 3:96. Jerusalem, until the Muslim conquest under the second Caliph of Islam in 637 CE, had been under the control of Byzantine Christians for centuries. So, the question of the presence of a Masjid in Jerusalem during the lifetime of the exalted Prophet should not arise. Again, Muslims conquered Jerusalem in 637 CE during the Rule of the second Caliph of Islam, Umar    follow, Ahsanul Hadith (The Best Hadith) 39:23,This  verse Nullifies all man made hadith . common sense, if i have BEST HADITH why follow not so best one !! if you do ,you may,no compulsion. i will follow The Best One     change of Direction was command of Allah Allmighty,which people followed and some didnt follow,its not a proof of sunnah,it was who followed command of Allah Allmighty,and who didnt, its called Sifting of people who claimed to be believers,  i hope the matter is clear !    Clearly you didnt read my answer carefuly     my dear friend ,you must follow the Verse in Glorious Quran ,what may come ,that is the Command of Allah Allmighty,we have no other choice but to follow Allah Allmighty's revelations for our salvation.  The verse in discussion here is     2:144 We have seen you turning your face about the sky (searching for the right direction). We now assign a Qiblah that is pleasing to you. Henceforth, you shall turn your face towards the Sacred Masjid. Wherever you may be, all of you shall turn your faces towards it. Those who received the previous scripture know that this is the truth from their Lord. GOD is never unaware of anything they do.    where does Allah Allmighty Says, face Jeruselum in the said verse !!!! why do you insert the words, which Allah Allmighty never said !!!!    you asked what direction, there is no direction given in Glorious Quran.the common concept is it was Al-Aqsa and i gave you the answer that Aqsa is not what Allah Allmighty Ordered,   now the question is,where have sunnis gotten this from,that Prophet went to Ascension from Al-Aqsa !!!!!    Thats the Billion Dollar Question . !!!!!!    Dear Raw this is where majority make fatal mistake by inserting words ,which totaly change the meaning of the verse and give wrong information to the reciter/reader of the Glorious Quran,they take these words in brackets as part of Glorious Quran as part of Iman.,see 2:143 where is the word Jeruselum in the arabic verse !!  what was in jeruselum at that time !! we only know that the direction was changed and thats all we need to know ,which direction what direction ,its none of our business to know,    read my answer earlier it is precisely according to verse 2:143   this command of Allah Allmighty came to test those who called themselves believers, many must have failed the test , this is how Allah Allmighty test and then sift,believers from unbelievers/hypocrites.|`|Tledw3eAaa	So I kind of have my own billion dollar question, if you don't mind.    What makes the hadiths/sunnah you go by the correct one, yet makes the others incorrect? I am not saying I am for or against hadith/sunnah at this point. I haven't read them, only the Quran, so I remain neutral to the idea of things beside the Quran.    Yet honestly, my immediate reaction is that I'm not sure I trust it. After all, everyone has a different opinion on which is right and which is wrong, yet at the same time they say theirs must be followed or you either are rejecting the Qurans teachings or are not a true muslim.    If you don't follow sunnah beside the Quran, well sorry, you are not following Islam. If you follow the Sunnah, well sorry, you might still not be following Islam if it's not the same that I follow. It just seems to me that many say you have to follow the Sunnah, yet in the same mouthful are telling everyone else they follow a faulty and incorrect sunnah!    I am not trying to be disrespectful in any way. I just trying to show you why some people (at least me) feel that the idea of following Sunnah seems like a lost cause. Maybe I prefer to follow what I know in my heart is right, and I choose to reject this idea that I need to go out there and choose a religious sect, choose the right sunnah, choose the right side.    I don't feel like being a part of the sometimes incredibly hateful discussions that go here (I don't mean with you, I mean in general) where I see everyone pointing their finger at each other because the hadith/sunnah the other guy follows says something they don't agree with.    I accept the fact that most of the people here follow something beside the Quran, and I accept I know too little about the hadiths/ahadith to give an opinion. Yet if I'm going to be doing things the wrong way, no matter which way I do them, why would I follow what I am unsure of because everyone is saying it is the right way? Why should plant myself into the middle of an idea that all those who follow it argue amongst themselves about?    You say you are speaking to submitters and quranis, and not muslims in general with the whole sunni vs shia thing... yet that is only in the context of this question. Everywhere else it seems everyone is pointing their fingers at someone, regardless of what they do and do not follow. I mean, if I am following some cult, apparently everyone else is as well depending on who's eyes you're looking through.    I don't go around telling others they've got it completely wrong, I accept them for whatever they believe, and if they can't accept me for following only the Quran... than I am content letting it be their problem, and not mine. I just don't understand why others are incapable of doing the same.    So whatever cult I am apparently a part of, we are still both capable of respect, are we not? Are we not still worshipping the same god?    May he guide and bless us ALL|`|zBqt99avaa	Forgive me.  I'm not an anything person, based on your criteria, but I simply don't understand.    If the Quran does not indicate that it was once necessary for Muslims to face Jerusalem when you pray, what difference does that make?  If you are supposed to face Mecca, why would it be necessary to include that you once faced Jerusalem?  I mean, if you shouldn't do that now, then...it only makes sense that it's not in the Quran, because if it was in the Quran, someone would argue to pray that way is better, etc., and this way there is no argument.    I get that you're trying to make a point but I don't see the point, sorry. (no disrespect)    I don't speak Arabic, so going by what you put up, Qiblah means direction of prayer, not necessarily direction to a specific place.  So if you drop the extras in parenthesis, you are simply advised that there was once a test and people prayed in a different direction to make sure they followed the Prophet (pbuh).  What does it matter about Jerusalem?    EDIT:  I didn't think it was a sunni/shia thing, but I'm just not picking up what you're putting down.    EDIT:  Okay so I just asked Mustafa about this, hoping he could explain it to me.  But he got caught up in your explanation.    Apparently, the reason why Muslims used to pray towards Jerusalem was because there were idols in the Kabbah at that time.  Once the Prophet (pbuh) entered Mekkah and cleared out the Kabbah, THEN Muslims started praying towards Mekkah.      So who's right?

This is also the stage where you discover your sexuality as a man or a woman and act upon your curiosity to what adult people around you do.      Look under your pants.  Does it say a man or a woman?  Then that's who you are and that's what you should follow.  If you are a man under your pants and try to be a women, you will never ever feel the real freedom deep inside.    Think of it this way.  You will always have a choice, one that will lead to good and bear fruits of goodness, truth, love and peace of mind AND the other can lead to death like misery, loneliness and disappointments.  So make sure that the choices you make today even if it entails saying no to your present feelings can bear good fruits for tomorrow.    Feeling are very deceiving and if you depend on it, it will surely lead you to death.  You have your free will and if you are guided by the ways of God you will always be lead to have good fruits and to real love.    Stop masturbating and engaging yourself in porn, learn to live a life of chastity and real virtues of prudence, temperance, justice, fortitude, and truth.  You are in control.  Discipline yourself, because what you are doing will lead you to loveless life.    Discipline is also what you need.  People have succeeded in life with disciplining their body and feelings.  And just imagine what discipline of heart can lead you to.  GREAT LOVE!|`|satoCRC6aa	go get some counseling to help you see just who you are and what your attracted to and why.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	You are human! Don't put yourself into a category and go with the flow. If eventually you want a relationship with a girl, do what feels right. If not, that's okay too. Women are beautiful & sometimes it can be confusing. However, there is nothing abnormal about getting turned on from lesbians kissing. Some lesbians may be offended because of you watching the porn, though. Good luck and I wish you the best!|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	you're human...  dont worry if you are attracted to guys   but get turned onby girls.  alot of people are like that  but they just dont say anything.  but goodluck :)|`|XhiYZ9kqaa	Hey there, i'm a bisexual edging toward gay 15yo male, when i first started having feelings for men it started with just fantasies and gay and bisexual porn, then i experimented wit a friend, and again wit two others, and now i check out guys n girls n it doesn't matter to me, it sorta happened slowly over last two years for me, and it might do that for u, or maybe you'll experiment a bit more and work out it's not for u, just experiment safely and with people you trust, good luck, -xXx-|`|WDbE5gffaa	You're bi because you are sexually attracted to both males and females.

kkO87h0Xaa	A person who kills innocent people in the name of Islam, and in the name of Allah.    A person who distorts the message of Islam, and purposely, causes chaos, without thinking of the consequences it will have as a whole on the Ummah.    A person who re-defines, and commits Shirk, yet, calls him/herself a Muslim, and a person who hypocritically claims to be a Muslim, while distorting, and not practicing its True message.    A person who goes around labeling who is a Muslim, and who isn't a Muslim just because of minor differences, and a person who labels things Haram and Halal without any adequate reasoning.    --This is my definition of Extremist; not necessarily Muslim, but that's not for me to decide.|`|45c74b30928a0438344dca9abf6daf68aa	There is really no such thing as a Moderate Muslim.|`|zKFSCCWOaa	When they completely ignore the love and compassion Muhammad (pbuh) showed towards his enemies when he conquered them.

When they were brought to him, he said No one is closer to Allah but me. I fast and a break my fast. I marry women. Then, I pray and then I sleep (part of the night a pray and sleep.

Man needs to make the beliefs of others less so that his own beliefs seem more real to him/her.  Every Soul is an aspect of God, and God is composed of Neutral Spiritual Energy, which is an Absolute Energy which is Truth and Love.  The Soul, like that of God is permanent, and cannot be other than it is, ever.  But being "Neutral" God projected the Creation for we Souls to explore and experience so that we can discover what we are and can be.    Since God is Love, and each Soul is Love, the gentleman was wrong in his belief, but that is par for the course on this plane of illusion.    Peace|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	Simple.

It is how we handle Life and everything in it that is key.  Are we going to let it kick our butts or are we going to overcome the obstacles and adversities that we all face on our journey?    Several here on R&S have read the bible more than once yet have no need or desire to label themselves with religious titles.  Jesus said "there will be tribulation" he didn't say there might be!  Some christians think that they are beyond having to go through difficult times and then wonder where God is after they've prayed for days or months.  It takes our own efforts to overcome, no one is going to do that for us.    We already have the built in capacity to handle and 'overcome' the obstacles of this world just like Jesus did.  Several have to get over themselves and put their Soldier Boots on.  :)|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Huh huh, you said "taint".

CGxQ9vSuaa	I totally agree with you.  I especially believe its the downfall of the entire reproductive system in this country as a whole.  For starters, how absurd is it that a woman aged 18-30 of her own choosing, cannot elect to have a tubal ligation without overcoming mounds of obstacles.  It is acceptable and legal though for a woman to choose to have an abortion at any age with or without parental consent.  Now I am neither advocating for either, but I'm just stating a fact of gross imbalances in place. Families that have children and cannot afford them are most of the time uneducated in these areas and lack the necessary resources and are, honestly selfish.  Nevertheless, there are still alot of politics involved.  I think if you continue to have child after child, you should not be allowed to receive (more) welfare as this only stagnates ones upward mobility in life and increases taxes for the rest of us to pay.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	I don't believe the majority of people are looking for a handout.  And maybe if they can't afford the necessities, they can't afford birth control either.|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	Dont say the majority are looking for a hand out.  Growing up poor, I have known many on welfare.  Yes there are lots looking for handouts, but not the majority.    anyways, people that liove off welfare to be honest don't know any better.  For one they aren't educated to know about access to birth control nor that the form they are using is effective.  Many people think pull out is a good method.  also, they "know" they will always be poor and they also know they want to have kids, so they have them.|`|AA10169179	because some families believe children is a gift from God and that aborting it would be a sin, a crime.  like the Catholic, they encourage big family and not use birth control.|`|AEqOczcCaa	Ignorance, lack of education/family planning and just plain stupidity. A lot of the people you're talking about are mentally challenged, drug addicts and/or living their lives the way their parents did. These people never actually think about having kids nor do they think about the consequences of having sex, they just do it.    I agree, welfare started off as a program to allow people down financially to survive when all else fails. But today, we have an entire class of people who abuse the system.

sMSXWPWgaa	Can't say I've ever heard it apart from in the context of pro-ana. So the literal sense.    Are you sure you don't mean starved of affection or striving for perfection?

sprTKDAEaa	There is no exact translation, because this term is also used in our/macedonian language! I think "bitanga" is serbian word!  More or less, bitanga means:  - idiot =   - glupak =   - seljak = ?    Greetings from Macedonia|`|IcTBvG0saa	Bitanga is 'brute' / 'rascal'
hOf38vgpaa	Race is a broader and more superficial classification. By that I mean, most people are classified as one of three races, Caucasian, African or Oriental  or some mixture of these three. Within Caucasian, some think there are sub types such as, Anglo Saxon (Germanic/ Nordic), Celtic, Semitic. However, overall, Race just doesnt provide much detail. In addition, Race doesnt necessarily tell us about  deep ancestry. So, it's kind of superficial.     Ancestry on the other hand provides deeper and more detailed information about one's ancestors, which may or may not be obvious from our racial classification.  For example, I have a friend whose grandmother was native American that lived on a reservation. However, he doesnt look Native American, since all his other grandparents are Caucasians. He is married to a Caucasian woman and their children are blue eyed blondes - Caucasian. Hence, race cannot always tell us about a person's deep ancestry.    In my case, my father and mother are from India. We look and classify as East Indian by race. However, according to our myth of orign, my paternal ancestors (deep ancestry) came from the Middle East, traveling thru Northern Iran/ (Persia), to settle in India, 800 years ago. I didnt think it was possible. So, to test this myth/ legend, I approached FamilytreeDNA.   http://www.familytreedna.com/    According to the DNA study, less than 1 in 1000 Indians are paternally related to me. In other words, there arent too many Indians related to my father's family. We were definately recent immigrants to India. The question was from where? The results suggest that my paternal origins are shared with Ashkenazi Jews of Bessarabia/ Moldova. According to the results,  I am 20 times more likely to find someone closely related to me paternally, in Bessarabia/ Moldova than India. I belong to haplogroup subclade J2a1* one of more than 800 Y DNA haplogroup subclades in the human population:    http://www.isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_YDNA_SNP...    I found out, it is the most common haplogroup among Jews, Samaritans and the Bene Israel of India. According to the DNA lab,  my sons and my sons' sons so on and so forth will all carry this mutation, common among Jews,  no matter what race of girl they marry. For me that was a big wow and well worth the money spent on testing my ancestry.     So which is more important, race or ancestry? In my opinion,  Race is kind of obvious and boring, Ancestry is deep, interesting and mysterious.  Take your pick!|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	They both provide valuable information. There may be branches in ones ancestry that different races of the past, and some branches are not different races.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Your ancestry can be French, Danish, Italian and English but your race would be white. Race basically sums up the region most of your ancestry is from.
AGr84buIaa	Spanish will be great for you... specially because you already have previous experience with French.

If you can learn grammar and vocabulary, you will be ready to speak with any spanish speaker.|`|JcZIjpU4aa	I speak both spanish and french, spanish as first language. I can say it was very easy to learn french knowing spanish, I could actually communicate and understand french before even knowing anything about it. Im sure it works the other way around too hehe|`|tQsxsuNPaa	I have NO IDEA what you mean by "crash higher"???    You will pick up Spanish VERY quickly, if you are pretty strong in French.  Most of the difficult stuff, you have already learned...things like how to and why to conjugate a verb, that there are genders for everything, word order is different and things like Il fait chaud, etc.  Almost all of that will apply directly to Spanish.  Now all you have to do is learn the vocabulary differences.       Honestly, I majored in Spanish, and speak it fluently.  I can THINK in Spanish, when I turn it on...I have never quite had the chance to polish up my French that far...so, I cheat.  I think in Spanish, and say it with a French Accent!  For the most part, that's all I have to do!  (sometimes the expressions aren't the more common ones, but I'm understood!).      I'm also doing Italian right now.  PIECE OF CAKE!  Because of a strong Latin background.      Try livemocha.com to either get started, or get the basics.  Can't hurt, and it's free.  bbc.com has a good system, too, and you can hook up with nosayudamos.com, as well, for extra practice.      ?Buena suerte!|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I wouldn't.

AA11245447	Chanukah is a minor holiday in our religion.  The story goes that when the temple was reclaimed, there was only enough unspoiled/uncontaminated oil for 1 day.  Surprisingly enough, it lasted for 8 days.

The Syrians were oppressive, and so the Jews mounted a revolt. There were many battles, many of them bloody. The Jews won a surprising amount of battles due to their tactical superiority, even though they were far outnumbered. In a retaliation blow, the Syrians attacked the Temple and essentially looted the place. Resorting to guerilla tactics, a group of rebels led by the Maccabees managed to ambush the Syrian army while outnumbered several hundred to one and forced them to retreat, scoring a major victory for the Jews. The Jews were able to reclaim the Temple and continued to push back the Syrians. The holiday was originally observed to commemorate the military victory and God's grace in letting the Jews prevail, but later rabbis probably created the story of the oil that burned for 8 days as military might and violence became less popular in favor of peace and love. There are still a couple Hanukkah songs out there which allude to the terrific military accomplishment.|`|HjVjSI6uaa	okay, so the jews had this big temple that was really cool.  inside was a candle that was supposed to always burn and never go out.  enemies came and destroyed the temple because they hated the jews (go figure.) The jewish soldiers were called macabees.  After the enemies left, the jews realized that the eternal candle only had enough oil left to last one day and there was nothing they could do about it and they were sad. However, by some miracle, the candle burned for 8 days.  Hanukkah celebrates that miracle. it is also why hanukkah lasts 8 days and why they light the menorah.
4sh2oRR7aa	I think that's really sad and offensive to their white families. It's like saying they never existed. Also it promotes the idea that you must conform to one culture instead of two. Not all mixed people look black so that's not always a factor. Some look pure white and some you can tell are mixed. My cousins are mixed and they've all got green eyes and blonde hair. They're paler than I am and I'm white myself. You should acknowledge all sides of your family. You can't pick and choose your race. White people are not as racist and unaccepting as people think. Obviously their family dated outside of their race and they raised their child to think interracial dating was okay. They're going to accept anyone they bring home.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Maybe they aren't as accepted by their Caucasian side of the family.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	i think its messed up  because i know a lot of people who are bi-racial and then they say that they hate white ppl and i'm like wtf ur half white how can u say that?  people should accept who they are|`|XimcTAFpaa	No they don't.    My friend is German( his mother) and African American (his father)    He was born dark skinned.    If he went around saying he was white.................    He understands he is biracial, but goes as black because thats how people see him.        Now a family friend she is biracial (she says so)  Her father (african american) and her mother (white)    She was born with pale skin, and jet black hair and blue eyes..........she doesn't say she is black, but biracial.    Hope this has helpped you.      Plus history wise blacks have always took them in as family unlike their other side.|`|i48kxrbaaa	I guess it may depend with which parent they were raised with (if in a single parent home).

It really just comes down to where you were raised (your neighborhood/community). If you were half Asian half white and you lived in Oklahoma where there's no distinct Asian population, then you'll probably be more white. If you were in San Diego/L.A. where its really diverse, you'll see that the Asian side will be more accepted and respected because your parent (the Asian one) would hold on to their culture. Also just comes down to how open-minded you're willing to be.|`|77f2295c3cf2cea79caaed785ef71e9eaa	Not where I am from .Only in the USA they seem to be obsessed with that one drop rule and if you look white or black  k|`|F3e24Xsfaa	negrology says i dont blame them since whites had a bad reputation in the past|`|hL5Kjdk8aa	Because most of the time we don't fit in with the white side, they look at us as Black.

Strong people tend to be larger in muscle mass and need more food or will starve. Historically the smaller people have survived.  Before the advent of farms food supplies where instable so bigger stronger people who needed more food died, but so did naturally skinny people.  The fat people with slow metabolism are really the ones who have survived historically.  Physically strong people have few advantages really in a crisis.    Strong have more Sx geberally so more likely to get an std that can be leathal like aids.

oVeGMNsLaa	Several reasons:    1) A lot of straight men just don't like looking at men, which is something you have to do when you watch straight porn. For guys who get turned off at the sight of naked men and male body parts (other than their own, that is), lesbian porn easily fixes the problem.    2) If one girl is good, two is better! Or at least, that's what a lot of men believe.    3) It lets men in on a world they don't otherwise get to see. What we don't know is mysterious and exotic, and many men fantasize and imagine- what exactly DO lesbians get up to together? A lot of people can't even conceive of sex without a penis, so they're obviously curious and it's really hot to watch and get that voyeuristic feel of peeking into the bedroom's into which they would otherwise not be allowed entry.    4) Much of the mainstream, girl-on-girl porn produced by men for men to consume, is very soft, playful, and gentle. For men who get turned off by rougher boy/girl scenes, lesbian porn is perfect.    5) Lots of female pornstars openly admit that they prefer doing girl/girl scenes- they are with another woman, so there isn't an unequal power dynamic, and it's less stressful- it's just two girls having fun. Lots of time this communicates itself onscreen, so you get more real orgasms in lesbian porn (although there is still so much faking), and what looks like genuine enjoyment instead of acting the way there can be in boy/girl scenes. Men (and women) tend to enjoy watching happy pornstars.    6) It's taboo. Two girls together is still somewhat taboo and "rare", so that adds in even more heat and sexiness.    7) Somewhat related to  3, there are some men who watch it from that viewpoint, but more mean-spirited and vengeful. These are the guys who have been spurned by lesbians or bisexual women, and watch it feeling vindicated that they get to see lesbians (the same reason, for example, that many men like "Girls Gone Wild" instead of more hardcore fare- it lets them vicariously 'get with' all the young girls who rejected them back in high school).    8) Somewhat related to  5 but a little different- a lot of men believe that women can better please a woman (because they have vaginas so they know what others like), and they feel because of this, they can watch hotter, better pleasuring in lesbian porn than straight porn.    9) When's the last time you saw extended cunnilingus in a straight porn video? Exactly. If you like seeing the vagina being lovingly lavished, lesbian porn is the place to go.    10) Men are programmed to think it's hot. We always seem to forget that the media has a large part to play in what we think is sexy, and they definitely promote girl-on-girl as something sexually desirable.    11) It's "innocent". Oddly enough, a lot of men who watch porn feel disdainful for girls who seem "skanky" or like "sluts" for being in porn and sleeping with so many men. They want to see girls who aren't jaded and experienced, and lesbian porn harkens back to that for them- images that inundate our culture (young girls having sleepovers and practicing kissing and whatnot). Two girls together is often portrayed by porn as "innocent", "exploratory", and so on.    12) We all want what we can't have. Men can't, by definition, have lesbians. Hence it becomes even hotter.    There are probably more reasons, but this is a lot of it.|`|e7gkttgcaa	its hot...idk|`|QgSSq3R7aa	Because we can take the place of either, if it's male/female you can envision yourself being the male.

c90dx5Doaa	i don't know about all this celebrity stuff but my theory on hatred is that people are taught that what they believe is right and the thinking that you're right leads to the more negative everyone else is wrong and this leads to either someone hating them for being different or it could cause the other person to stand up for their own beliefs and values and cause a fight initiating hatred|`|TZeKta4haa	good question...................|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Because when people get older they realize that they don't have to be nice to everyone.|`|K6wIRsOIaa	People think they sound smart if they fight over something.

To much unjustified expectation, ever see how a child    acts when they don't get there way, and guess who gets    the brunt of the anger and hate, the very person who the    child doesn't realize, is not only the person who gave    them life in the first place, but could take them out just as     easy if they had a mind to . . .        And of course it doesn't stop there as we all know, exspectation,    some one has exspectation of recieving best answer for this    question and will likely not be in the best of moods, should they     be skiped over for another, how ever, you used the word hate,    but rejection deffinately earns the dinction of growing to that    emotional state, one need only reffer to a love relationship,    where one partner or the other exspect back what they them    selves give but instead, are thrown over for another, shall we     say 3rd party random intrusion, and it becomes quite apparent,     how hate can grow on one . . .

AA12203324	Trinity: The belief of most Christians that God is one being expressed in three distinct person, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.    The Bible is largely allegorical.

Mar 12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.        Mar 12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.        Mar 12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.        Mar 12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.        Mar 12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?        Mar 12:25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	Matthew 22:23That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him with a question. 24"Teacher," they said, "Moses told us that if a man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. 25Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his wife to his brother. 26The same thing happened to the second and third brother, right on down to the seventh. 27Finally, the woman died. 28Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her?"    29Jesus replied, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God. 30At the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage; they will be like the angels in heaven. 31But about the resurrection of the deadhave you not read what God said to you, 32'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'[a]?

FyHaU0D6aa	Latin does not really have reflexive possessive pronouns, per se. A reflexive possessive pronoun is a possessive pronoun usually in the third person (his, her, their) that makes it clear that it refers back to the subject of the sentence, rather than someone else.    Ipse and idem (meaning self and same, more or less) are used to this effect in Latin. In other languages (like the Scandinavian ones), two different sets of possessive pronouns exist.    Compare the following (Danish) examples:  Hun talte med hendes far = she spoke to her father, and  Hun talte med sin far = she spoke to her father    In the first, hendes (her) is a non-reflexive possessive pronoun, meaning that the her it refers to is different from the subject of the verbthe person she is speaking to is another girl/womans father, not her own father.    In the second, on the other hand, sin (his/her) is a reflexive possessive pronoun, which leads unequivocally back to the subject in the clause, meaning that she is now speaking to her own father.

If you don't find yourself attracted to women at all, I don't think I would put you in the "gay" category. But it is extremely possible that you may be Bisexual. This is what I labeled myself until I became entrely sure that I am a Lesbian.I say give it some more time, and try not to freak yourself out.
