20090222200901AASML2X	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Shall anyone write the following article in another way, please, 10 points for sure!?	Anabolic Steroids   Anabolic Steroids are powerful drugs that help the body gain mass, but also hurts the body with drastic side effects. Anabolic Steroids are a type of natural and synthetic hormone that stimulates cell growth and division, resulting in an increase of muscle tissue and strength. The growth only occurs when combined with physical training (Wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids).   Anabolic Steroids may help you gain muscle mass, but with a high price. Steroids have noticeable side effects including acne and scars, an increased sex drive, increased hair growth in Androgen-Sensitive areas, deepened voice along with an increased vocal cord size, more or bigger muscles, a larger appetite, bone remodeling, increased production of Red Blood Cells, liver damage, headaches, irritability, trouble sleeping, and jaundice (Santella 613.8). In Males, the penis may decrease or increase in size, breasts can be developed, premature balding, and testicular pain. In Females, development of man-like features may occur (Santella 613.8).   There are many different types of Anabolic Steroids, but mostly there are oral anabolic steroids and intravenous steroids (Santella 613.8). Oral Steroids are usually pills that one would take through the mouth. Intravenous Steroids are injected into the body (Santella 613.8). Some different types of Oral Anabolic Steroids are Anadrol, Anavar, Dianabol, Maxibolin, Methyltestosterone, Primobolin, and Winstrol (Santella 613.8). Types of Intravenous Steroids include Triamcinilone, Betamethasone, and Prednisone (Santella 613.8).   Teenagers are often users of Anabolic Steroids. Teens often acquire Anabolic Steroids from dealers at school, the Internet, or some types are even sold over the counter at local health stores. For that reason, a large amount of teenagers have access to the drug for their use. As for the reason teens use steroids, those who have admitted to taking them have said they used them to be better at sports, "fit in" or "be sexy" (Santella 613.8). Statistically, Male teens are more prone to use anabolic steroids than female teens, because males are more likely to try to get an advantage in sports. About 14% of athletes in the 12th grade were found to be using steroids, and about 13.3% of 10th grade were found to be using steroids (Santella 613.8).   Teens have even made up their own slang terms for Anabolic Steroids. Some of these names include "juice", "gum", "candy", "pumpers", and "pops".    "Arnolds", and "Stackers". Such slang terms can be used as "code names" in order to keep them secret from adults or authorities (Santella 613.8).    In the United States, Anabolic Steroids are illegal. The first time a person in the U.S. is caught using steroids, they may get up to ten years in prison, up to a $15,000 fine, and a two year probation period. The second time a person is caught using or selling steroids there is a maximum fine of $30,000, up to two years of probation, and possibly ten years in prison (Monroe 613.8). In Canada and Australia, Anabolic Steroids are not illegal, but are highly discouraged. (Rogak 613.8)   Athletic Associations have taken the subject of Anabolic Steroid use very seriously. Major League Baseball currently enforces a strict code against the use of steroids. For a first positive steroid test, the player caught using the drug is suspended for ten games. For a second positive steroid test, the player caught using the drug is suspended for 100 games. Finally, for a third positive test, the player caught using steroids is given a lifetime ban from baseball. (Espn.com/news)   The National Football League currently enforces rules against steroids that for a positive test, the player caught using the steroids could be suspended for four games (wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Le...    The National Collegiate Athletic Association also enforces strict rules against the use of steroids including being suspended from college sports to even being permanently banned. (wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_...   The Olympics currently enforce the harshest penalties of all of the Steroid restrictions. Steroid usage currently could earn the athlete caught using Steroids a lifetime ban and up to $100,000 fine for a minor infraction, and up to a $1,000,000 fine for serious breaches of the rules. (sportsillustrated.cnn.com)   Anabolic Steroids were invented accidentally in the 1930s by a team of German scientists, but the drugs were not deemed significant enough for any further study. The first known reference to Anabolic Steroids in a United States weightlifting magazine was in a letter to the editor of the magazine Strength and Health. In the 1950s, scientists of the Food and Drug Administration approved the steroid called methandrostelone in the United States. (wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_Steroids)   In the 1990s counterfeit drugs became easier to detect using new technology. In 1991, the U.S. Congress passed the Controlled Substances Ac

It's been good so far.   I am getting good grades. Currently, I am 21 finishing my first year(had to take catch up classes).      So, here is the problem...I myself am disabled(aspergers syndrom).   I called districts and they said that's actually a good thing if your going to teach special needs kids.      What I am worried about is I myself am practically special needs.   Intellectually, my intelligence and social skills are on par with everyone else. However, I seem to forget to do basic life skills(cleaning up after myself)      Over the last 21 years I have worked to get myself up to speed on everything else except that....      Also, I myself have some emotional challenges as well(anger sometimes).      I am also worried I will burn out like a lot of the teachers.

20090222213208AAA6lEA	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Did I answer the question? Homework help.?	"Tone is very important when communicating online. How will your tone, or writing style, change based on the different types of people you will be communicating with online? Consider family, friends, classmates, and instructors in your response."      My response:      The tone of one will often change through on-line communication. For an example of how a person may write to a friend, one might say, "Hey man how are things?" The author uses an informal tone and etiquette in there message. When one is writing to a family member such as there husband or wife, they might use words for names of endearment such as, darling, honey, love, baby, and so on. However, the same author when writing a business or an employer would use a formal unromantic tone. The writer would use correct puncture and business like etiquette.  To conclude, just as a person would not call there boss or instructor, "Dude" in person, so they would not on-line. Still however informal and romantic speech between lovers and friends often occurs. Tone change is a vital part to on-line communications as it reflects respect and attitude.

I am not that stupid to go and try and break something or sprain something, and I am not actually going to make myself vomit or something. Just a fake cold will do it. Please be VERY specific. Thanks!

20090222204324AA6XWzN	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Why is the word "random" used so much these days? Are more things actually random than in the past, or is the?	or is the word simply used more broadly?      Whereas the Hippies would talk of "random acts of kindness" 40 years ago, my generation used the word even less frequently (80s, 90s).  But today, everything is apparently random.  Everywhere I look, things look the same as always, but they are called random.   It's making me crazy.

20090222211811AAQcljN	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Problems with Time Management?	I am currently taking six APs including a science course that is both strenuous and time-consuming.  Apart from the APs, I also have many extra-curricular activities that are very time-consuming.  Although I usually make decent grades, my grades have dropped somewhat recently as the workload has become literally impossible with my current time management skills.  The problem is that when I get on the computer, lose complete track of time, and it seems as if my mental processing unit just goes completely blank.  I go to facebook, email, pointless games, etc etc, and end up wasting hours upon hours of time.  How can I get around this horrible problem?  I feel as though the computer eats up time I desperately need to complete other activities.  In addition, it's becoming increasingly hard to do things without the computer as most school assignments revolve in their entirety around the computer and internet.

My flight was yesterday but i had hoped if i slept in i would miss the flight and wouldnt have to leave, my plan didnt work though because my dad ended up making sure that i left. I can't stop thinking about how i wanna be home in washington with my family and friends. The one main reason i left was because i didnt get along with my step mom. And my dad made a point to tell me that i couldnt come back until i completely appreciated my dad and step mom. And now that i'm here in arizona i've started to act different towards my mom and step dad because how i'm feeling about this whole situation thinking maybe if i'm rude they'll send me to go back to washington. It's not like me to be rude to my mom either I just don't want to start all over and go to a new school where i know nobody the end of my junior year. People have been telling me that i'll make friends and it could be a fresh new start but i honestly don't wanna have to start all over and meet new people because i did it my sophmore year which ended up being a complete disaster.

20090222220515AAJHweZ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What can I do to make my Yale application stand out?	would love to get into Yale; it's my dream college. I'm currently a freshman in high school.. Right now I'm taking all honors classes and Spanish a year ahead... I'm not doing as well as I would like, but I've got time to fix it I think. I'm planning on skipping Alg. 2 Honors next year and moving into Pre Calc Honors. My school uses a 5.0 scale, my GPA is currently 4.0, which I know is far too low, but I'm going to fix that this term and next. I'm not dropping any honors classes next year. I'm probably going to do track next year all three seasons. I'm an important member of my school newspaper, vying for an editor position. I do art, and I have "natural talent" at painting especially. Also next year, I'm planning on getting involved in my school's Model UN club. OH and English is my best subject...      So... thoughts, help?   I have no connections in Yale, also.      Oh, and even though I would love to go to Yale, I will apply other places and know that I might not get into Yale.       Soo thanks to all answerers! 10 pts to the best answer!      Also: this summer I'm planning on volunteering at my local hospital.      Is this enough???? Also what set you apart and allowed you to get into Yale?       Also, for those that have done JSA, I'm thinking of applying; is it worth it?      I'm really stressed right now. If you read above, you can see that there are probably 1000 students who do the same things as me... only better.      Soooo what can I do to stand out among the hundreds of thousands of hopefuls other than an essay? What can I do NOW?      I just want to make it perfectly clear that I KNOW my grades need to be boosted.

Now I'm stuck in these paragraphs :    One delightful experience which you missed involved the critical strategies we incorporated in the Phase Group reports to the officers.    Clerical people transcribed the wonderful thoughts which group members scribed up on butcher paper taped to the wall. Some scribes didn't write all that clearly. A critical strategy was, " DON'T SELL PAST THE CLOSE." The transcription came out, " DON'T SELL PLASTIC CLOTHES." We left it in the report. I think one intermediate-level manager picked up on it and questioned it. He let us leave it in.   My Questions are:   1) What is a "butcher paper"? and does "taped to the wall" means to hang it on the wall ?   2) What does "DON'T SELL PAST THE CLOSE." mean?   3) The last sentence "He let us leave it in." means what?   4) "One delightful experience/ which you missed involved the critical strategies/ we incorporated in the Phase Group/ reports to the officers." Should I read the sentence like that?

I get saying LOL once in a blue moon, or ROFL if your short on time, but fish and abbreviations get rotten after three days. If you think about, laugh out loud doesn't apply as a viable sentence without a noun. Also, there's no periods to mark that it's an abbreviation, like P.E.T.A. or N.A.S.A. or N.A.T.O. Also, if you're trying to save minutes by typing less characters, just say 'ha' and save a L. Also, am I the only one in the world who makes a notable effort to stay grammatically correct? Jeez (technically not a word), I'm not trying to be a whiny twerp here, but can we go back to typing with intent of making a readable statement?

20081105200850AAcXIcN	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	My neice is being force fed religion at primary school?	She is 10 years old and has made it clear at her age that she has no belief in god, this is of her own choice, she seems to understand alot about religion and has never been nasty or horrible about other peoples beliefs.      In the last 2 years the school has shifted from religious studies in Christianity, to islam, she didnt seem to have much of a problem with it to start, but now she gas said she doesnt want to do the prayer part as she doesnt believe in it and it makes her uncomfortable, which she also said about christianity, yet there was no problems with that then.      My sister has now removed her from the lessons explaining why, and the religious education teacher has now had my niece suspended from the school due to her not paticipating.      whats the best way to go about this? can they really do that to her, purely because she refuses to partake in homage to beliefs she doesnt hold?      After all, is it not her human right not to do so? I am so angry about all of this and think its completely unfair. My sister doesnt want to kick up a fuss because she is worried people will look down on her (its a mainly islamic school now) and my sister herself carries those beliefs.      I myself am like my niece and was subjected to the same treatment because of it, but i want her to make her own choices in if she wants to follow a faith or not, and would never expect anyone to TELL her what she must do.      any advice please, from anyone who has suffered this?

Bonjour, je recherche les titres ainsi que les références des livres de lectures que j'avais en primaire (86-90).      CP: les personnages étaient une fille avec des bas rayés rouge et blanc et son chat mistigri.      CE-CM: couvertures cartonnées, des illustrations en noir et blanc avec des degradés d'oranges pour l'un et de vert pour l'autres, avec un style trés proches de ceux des illustrations des vieux bibliothéque verte/rose, peut etre que ces livres ont été edités dans les années 60-70.    Les textes étais assez courts au début et devenaient de + en + long, avec le vocabulaire en marge, un petit résumé en début pour présenter le contexte et suivis de 2 ou3 p. d'exercices divers .    Je me souviens que dans l'un des livres il y avait des extraits de 13 à la 12aine, Tistou les pouces verts et le pays des 36000 volontés et peut etre la chanson de Roland.

Whether it was sharing their love for traveling with me, teaching me good work ethic, or supporting everything that I did, all three influenced my childhood in great ways.      It needs to be at least 6 sentences, so I need to add to it. Any suggestions? Thanks!

20090203131149AA7lDc4	Education & Reference;Teaching	Which is the best teaching method, old or new?	When i was in school 50/60s, our teacher caned us, either on the hand or the backside.    Before that era they used to give you the slipper, six of the best on your backside on the stage in front of the whole school   So i felt lucky that we didnt get the slipper. I was caned for running in the school corridor, when i was late. So i had one for running and one for being late, across the palm.   Our teacher had a cane hanging on the wall, and seeing that was enough to keep us all quiet.   We were very afraid of our teachers and worked hard, so as not to annoy them.   Boys were dragged to the front of the class by their ear or by the tuft of hair in front of their ears...very painful.   Girls were dragged by their plaits (we all had them) by the teacher.   I know this sounds unreal to you youngsters, but it happened in all school across Britain and was considered normal.   We always done welland behaved, bcos we were afraid not to.   When i see the way kids treat their teachers today and the way they speak to them, its unbelievable for me.   What do you think of that then.?

20090203131209AAhulGx	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Settling down to do GCSE work; need some really helpful tips.?	Hi, it's my GCSE year and there is only a few months left of school and the start of the exams. I would really like hints and tips because most people in my year are settled and they work long each night filling in gaps and rounding things off in their subjects.   I feel i'm at a bit of a loss as i really don't have the willpower or motivation to sit down at my desk and study after school as i'm tired and can't be bothered really. I know that if i don't work hard i'll be in a really really bad job with no pay. I think about this and it really doesn't move me in any shape or form.    I really want to do well and progress through further education and get a good job that i really enjoy. I have tried before to go and sit at my desk and do a bit of work but i always get bored and fiddle with bits around me.    My friend works lots and lots and i really don't know how she does it but i really respect her for it as i don't think i could do that much, although i really would like to.   I'm also getting my room repainted to a lighter colour as my room is always dark and i wondered if this isn't doing me much good and not creating a good sense in the room.   I would like to know if you have any good hints and tips as i feel like i'm stuck in a rut and i have no energy to do school work after school hours. I would also like a routine too but i tried in the past and i can't stick with it.    I'm getting in trouble too because of my lack of effort and i would really like to turn this around for the last months. I also want to carry this motivation to work as i progress into Sixth year and hopefully University level.   I live in N.Ire. if you'd like to know.   Many thanks for any helpful anwers!
