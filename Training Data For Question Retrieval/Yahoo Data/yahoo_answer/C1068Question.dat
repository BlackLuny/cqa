This is a stupid question but I am thinking of getting a small stud in my nose tonight and my only real concern is goggles and the stud together.    I ride about 50 days a year and I dont want to have any irritation issues due to my goggles.  Should I get the piercing in the summer and let it heal before snow season?  Or will this not be an issue?    Also, I have a big event in about a week and a half.  Do you think I should wait until after to get the piercing due to possible infection?

Hello!!!! this is Mike Melton once again bringing news and updates from the basketball world during this winter there was numerous leagues and showcase that i covered but one stood out the most the funsport fireball league in brooklyn that featured some but most talent in New york players like Shaquille Davis, Ethan Telfair, Jordan Washington, and other palyers of this caliber but we had some studs that came from New Jersey that showed major competition at the high level we had Will joyce, Rakewon kelly, Stephen Mcnair these were baller who Represented the garden state and showed there worth in this tornament these three players played for the {New jersey Pirates} the squad from newark but now they joined with ppy elite wich now is formed and called the ppy pirates so there's much depth in that department but the newark team advanced to the first round of the playoffs and faced the power house assasins in the funsport leauge Ethan telfair was on this team as well as Shaquille Davis and Isiah Lewis these are all high ranking players from the 2013 class and i knew that this game was going to be a very high intense game.......         Stephen aka steph "Dominated" this game he torched the assasins for a 1st round playoff high of 27 points and showed why many coaches look at this kidd on the next level he led his team to the next round and they were up to face panthers the favorites to win the whole funsport league but even though the pirates were undersized i did'nt count them out because i knew the had legit scorers on their team and the smooth play of Rakewon Kelly and Stephen and not to count of the 6'3 giant of Will Joyce this game was the game of the week and i was anxious to attend once i entered the gym i couldn't even see my own feet because the game was so packed and big time players took the court but steph came out with 16 but it really didn't matter because the "Big Fella" Jordan Washington controlled the game and led his team with 31 points and took his team to the finals were they obtained their crown........       The 3 pirates also made the allstar team and i expect to see there performance much more in showcases and tornaments Will joyce and Stephen "No" longer play with ppy i won't be surprised to either see coach Kat snatch these young ballers up or to see the Playaz aau squad make a attempt at these ballers... this has been a Mike Melton flashback.......

Hollywood makes people think that u block using the blade. NOT TRUE! NO SAMURAI EVER BLOCKS WITH THE BLADE UNLESS HIS LIFE DEPENDS ON IT.       The rapier is second because in a duel, its good.

It's a 710-acre lake, with good populations of bass, walleye & crappie. (Fishing for bass.) The water is medium-depth, with signs of 12-14 inch bass in the shallows, along the shoreline. There isn't much cover for bass, w/ a couple man-made structures for them to hang out. Approximately %60 of the bass being largemouth, with the spotted bass coming 2nd, and the smallmouth bass at third. There's a couple boats out on the spot, creating ripples on the water. Lot's of huge shad & bluegills w/ minnows & crayfish nearly absent. The bass are looking lazy, and you're kind of looking for a reaction bite instead of hunger. 5 lb. bass are not uncommon but, most bass caught are between 14-18 inches, with some brutes heading toward 8 lbs. Soooo ... What lures & equipment would you be a tossin'?

20090128145624AAnxsY3	Sports;Cricket	"Letters from the war-zone", pertaining to cricket?	Friends,  I was reading  the following lines before I came into the cricket section. It was a narration of some scenes involving fierce fighting towards the end of WWII as allies moved into France:    "American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation."    It seems to me the cricket section is perhaps in a similar war zone after today's ODI.    Of course congratulations to India. But, do you agree that this section is often embattled with various warring factions, for example: traditional fighters, flankers, guerrilla experts , maybe cavalry, artillery, tanks, dive-bombers so on and so forth.    In you estimate could you attempt to give a descriptive description of this war-zone,     - the various maneuvers in place      -factions involved    -and the current status?    Thank you kindly    Rehman of Multan

I get a ride from my moms friend and son. The deal is I pay their registration/sign up fees and membership monthly IF they give me rides everyday. They have stood me up 3 times, no just stood me up as if they were doing something else- they were going to the gym but NOT taking me! Then they just all around stopped taking me while we were paying for their membership still because we had to give a month notice to cancel it. Now our gym merged with another gym and somehow we became friends again and started the deal again (rides for membership). I can not stand these people the son is mean to me. And now they are asking for gas money! Shouldn't the nearly $300 my mom payed to sign them up cover that? And what about $108 we payed on the first of january for their membership? When we agreed there was never mention of gas money? Is this messed up? Should I try to find another ride? Should I ask an instructor at the gym if they have anyone who can give me rides and I'll pay them gas money?? Is that awkard to ask? The people at the gym are really nice by the way. What would you do?? Thanks guys

I've already decided on John Lackey as my keeper pitcher. However, I'm still up in the air about my hitter and have narrowed it down to Prince Fielder, Chase Utley, or David Ortiz. Prince is a masher, but his output fell off drastically last year. Chase is an all-around stud, but is coming off hip surgery and his opening day status is up in the air. Ortiz was a major disappointment for me last year, as injuries held him way back and his ailing wrist leaves me questioning if he can return to the elite slugger he was. Please, if you're knowledgeable on fantasy baseball, any advice would be much appreciated as my draft is now less than two weeks away. Thanks!

Taker, HBK, Rey, Kane and among superstar like Orton and Edge not getting Main event spot at Mania.    Edge indeed had Main event match at WM but less then HHH, Cena, Batista combine, most of u got bored seen this superstar at WM main event.    Taker was involved 2 main even matches at WM so far with title shot.    wwe director, and Vince shown no respect to there fans.    Some people came up with their idea and WM card, but it seem dont work, very often.    I wish I took over only one night at WM for couple matches where fans would really enjoy the show. The question will be spoken what will I do for u fans.    How about I control some matches which would might changes ur memory for best WM u ever witness.    Let Vince and myself take care this    He do his card, I do mine      I don't care his card      Here is my greatest WM card u would love to see.     1st thing, WM on ppv, my choice will be for the 1st time WM in local tv, and on dish here in USA. people outside of USA would see WM for 20 dollar. Let's face it each ppv for 50 dollar, why not one night only a ppv for 20 dollar, and in USA people will see it for free on local tv and dish combine.     My WrestleMania card.    RatedRKO vs APA vs Hardy Boys 3way elimination tag match    All the superstar received the hall of fame award they will be in the same ring having a top rope battle royal, including past stars..    Triple H vs Rock vs Steve Austin 3way match.    Cena and Batista I will let Vince take care their matches      Khali vs Big Show vs Big Daddy V, vs Rikishi vs Mark Henry vs Kane 1st ever chamber match at WM    Before WM I would make a deal with Vince make sure Taker and HBK they both win a heavy weight title. Let's say Taker with wwe title, and HBK with WHC      Rey Mysterio vs Cm Punk vs all current and former ECW superstars a elimination match, they will fight by there self.      The main event u want to see and rest of the world want to see and that will be.    HBK vs Undertaker at WM    HBK with WHC and Undertaker with WWE title, winner takes all match.      U think I'm done with the surprises, I mentioned WM live at local tv. For free, so in wwe.com u will have a choice to pick a special guest referee for the match       it will be either Hulk Hogan or Goldberg       If GoldBerg refuses  to come then it will live me to let the fan pick    either Hulk Hogan or Ric Flair      How u like the card, now ur talking about serious deal.    That's another way to take care business.      I know I can't, if I did. Memory will least forever.      After that Mania event, I would be home and u all going to on in this section by logging in and talking about best WrestleMania u have ever seen        Cena and Batista they will have there match by Vince      How can u forget one time only WrestleMania, live in local tv, and dish, including cable.            On U S A

20090128151556AAkz662	Sports;Basketball	Are Celtics open practices free?	I want to attend a Celtics Open Practice one day.

20090128151950AAoXPrX	Sports;Basketball	Who will win the Big 12 this year?!?	Teams like OU and Baylor have come out of the basement for a little bit of sun (but we all know they will be back down there after this year. OU defiantly) The Big 12 isn't as good as it has been these past few years but who do you think will win the Big 12 this year? Record wise and Tourny wise? I say Kansas will get their 5th straight Big 12 title. They are the underdogs but they are arguably the best team in the Big 12 talent wise. Some might say OU is because of Griffin but that is only one player. KU has a ton of star freshmen that will be amazing next year and the year after. Plus the freshmen have gained a LOT of experience this year. Plus Sherron is the best PG in the Big 12 if not the NCAA and Cole Aldrich has really come out of his shell and has dominated. I say      Record- OU and KU will share it.   Tourny- I say KU pulls off the upset.       Best upcoming game in the big 12?      The KU at OU game will certainly be a great game and might be a Big 12 title preview.      So who are your picks?
