Starters work for a couple of seconds at a time.  If 10 or 15 seconds of work a day ruins a starter, then it is a crappy starter.  Remember, an alternator whirls all the time the car is running, which can be hours a day.<br>  UPS vehicles turn their vehicles off for every deliver, which is several times an hour.|`|ehJ45unqaa	The only thing it might damage is your starter.|`|kFsviR9waa	First of why would she do that, second it just might hurt the starter ,
OtDPZO3vaa	You need to find out if POWER is getting to the wiper motor. <br>  There should be a WIPER fuse. Make sure it's good. If you can't tell, remove another fuse, like the headlight fuse and put the wiper fuse in it's place. Do the headlights come on? If so, that fuse is good...put it back in the wiper fuse spot.<br>  <br>  The auto parts stores sell very inexpensive 12 volt electricity testers. Find the wiring harness and put one end of the tester to ground, then do a touch and go to each of the other wires, while the wiper switch is turned on. The light on the tester will come on when you get the correct wire. <br>  If the wipers still don't work, the chances are that the wiper motor is bad. It could  be that while the switch was bad, or shorted, that it burned that motor out.<br>  <br>  Figure that for the few dollars that you spent on the tester was a good investment and paid for itself. You may find a garage that does "free<br>  check-out" and they would do the testing for you and tell you what's going on. I'd be expecting that if power gets to the motor and it doesn't work, the motor is bad. <br>  Salvage yards are a good, cheap place to find a replacement if the motor does test bad.|`|JGXAcM4paa	3 words......advanced auto parts|`|Vm7nhi5daa	u may need a new wiper motor|`|AA12261615	check the switch that you bought for it,you could have bought a bad switch if the wipers was working before you changed the switch out then it has to be a fuse or a switch or relay,if you got access to a test light turn the wipers on and test for voltage at the wiper motor,this will help you in finding out if its the switch or a relay or the motor gone bad on it,good luck with it.
JXWC0fxPaa	Ask yourself - what's so different between driving in the daytime and driving at dusk or nighttime?<br>  <br>  Ok, the first one is reduced visibility at night. Unless there are street lights around, we can only see what our headlights illuminate. If the lights are not adjusted properly or are dirty, their effectiveness is further reduced.<br>  <br>  Most of us are at the end of our school or work day. We're not as sharp or focused, maybe even a little drowsy.<br>  <br>  Familiarity. Most of us drive the same roads, generally at the same time. We know the speed limits and how fast we can exceed them. Add in a little bad weather or maybe some construction or a traffic mishap and our routine becomes a bit more stressful. When we are thrown off our schedule, we try to make it up.<br>  <br>  To really up the ante, maybe we are a bit under the weather ourselves, taking some cold and sinus medicine and our reflexes are lagging way behind.<br>  <br>  Finally, the human brain does not reach full maturity until about age 25. Our decision making process, reasoning and discipline do not reach their full potential until that time.<br>  <br>  Conclusion: If one does not have to be on the road at night, don't.|`|rhtOTju0aa	i think that the rules should not be enforced because many teenagers have jobs that they have to work until late.<br>  <br>  they would not be able to drive home by themselves, they would have to find an adult to come and get them to take them home.

It is difficult to judge  how many lessons  one needs. Each person is different in their driving  capabilities I would say about 15 /20 lessons

A8dwFyq8aa	You need to the find the wire with 12v(constant).  It should be yellow.  You need to tap into all the wires in the wiring harness and see which one shows 12v in all positions.  The switched wire needs to show 12v when the key is turned on.  Then you need to ground the black wire.  If you hook those three wires your stereo will have power.|`|SBpl494Uaa	Well, for starers, maybe check the deck still works by putting the yellow and red together then to positive, then the black to ground. <br>  <br>  It probably made a frying sound because the wire got grounded out (When you turned the key back) and it had no fuse.<br>  <br>  If you cant find the power wires you need, your going to have to run off the fuse box. Just get a light tester and a friend to turn the key back and forth while you look for a spot to run from, ideally the original stereo spot.<br>  <br>  Hard to believe people still cut the factory stereo clips out of cars when a wire adapter costs like 10 bux.<br>  <br>  Anyways, good luck

HwujORd2aa	I have one and it's a really good car.  The previous person is right, it's a Camry engine that never dies.  I have had no reliability issues and I've had mine over 3 years (bought new).  The body makes some weird rattles sometimes but they've been fixable.  That's the only negative I've found.  I love 2-door hatchbacks, and the seats fold down so it's like a little truck when you have to haul stuff.  Love that!<br>  I like the pickup on it when I'm driving, the look of the car, the glass roof/sunroof, the ipod hookup, and that it's sporty and fun to drive. Best of all I liked that it was well under $19K brand new!|`|kFsviR9waa	I would def get the scion , more powerful then the mazda and reliable|`|mO3xPLWwaa	I have to agree. The tC is awesome from all of the reviews I've been reading. Also, if you didn't know... the tC had the same engine as a Toyota Camry which is a really reliable car. The Mazda I don't think is as reliable as Scion/Toyota. It's relatively good on gas mileage. I'm a student and know I will be driving a lot. My cousin just bought a Scion and my uncle is a mechanic. He gave me good feedback on the car as well. It's also very sporty looking which is a plus!! :)

But, you get used to the steering wheel controls in its place.<br>  <br>  And yes, there are whole debates as to which is better, the Toyota navigation system, or a portable 3rd party unit...|`|lB7uvA73aa	if you are gay then buy it|`|j8ek7F71aa	No.  They are slow, look like a disfigured spaceship and if that battery goes you are screwed.

Maybe we/I could give a different/better solution.<br>  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT:Oh,  what I have seen around hear is a orange bubble type spinning flashing light on the utility trucks and the same style is used on private party plow trucks here in MN. They are small, very bright, and do not draw that much juice, and magnetic. You can plug them into the cigarette lighter or hard wire them and toggle it to just leave them there. In MN when plowing with a pick up you have to have this light on by law. Where to get them, I know they sell them with plowing accessories in the plow lights section. Click here, <a href="http://www.northerntool.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.northerntool.com</a>   and in the search box type in flashing plow lights. the first one for $16.00 is the common one used. You can buy solar powered 12-volt battery chargers. I know they make them for the battery operated boat lifts in our area to recharge the batteries out on the docks.  I hope this will you out some.

PAceoX2oaa	The TPS sensor plug has a metal clip, looks like a paper clip bent like |_____|   <- that. That clip goes on the female end of the wiring plug and locks it into the male end of the TPS sensor. If the clip is missing, or if the plastic ears on the plug are broken, the plug can come off and trip the code. Check to make sure the plug is completely on the sensor and that the clip is on there. If it's not, you'll need to reconnect it and get a new clip from the dealership. <br>  <br>  The fuel pressure solenoid runs on a vacuum line from the intake manifold. Make sure the vacuum line is connected to the FPS and doesn't have any holes in it. There should also be an electrical plug on the FPS itself. Check to make sure that plug is also tight. <br>  <br>  If you do not know where these items are, please feel free to contact me or reference www.dsmtuners.com.

E0j6mhqhaa	I think I remember you having the same problem before and I mentioned checking the air filter.  If it's ok and runs the same even with the filter out, then it's either fuel or ignition and not air.  The other question is this: Has the bike always ran this way, did it run fine before or is the bike new to you and you can't answer?  The answer to that question is very important to a diagnosis.<br>  <br>  The other thing is this, does it seem to bog down when the throttle is wide open but if you close the throttle a bit, does it start running better?  If so, that's a classic sign of main jets that are too small.<br>  <br>  Here's something else you can try.  Unplug one spark plug wire and accellerate, noticing how it acts.  Stop, plug that one back on and unplug the next.  If it's ignition such as a bad ignition coil, you'll be able to pin the bad one down when disconnecting one or two plug wires makes very little difference in the way it runs.  If you have one bad secondary winding and one of the dual leads from one coil is bad, only one plug will misfire under hard accelleration.  If that's the case, when you unplug any of the good wires, it'll really run doggy.<br>  <br>  If it appears to be ignition related, check and make sure you don't have a loose or broken ground or positive wire on the coils.  A loose connection will let them fire normally under light loads but when you accellerate hard, they'll miss.  <br>  <br>  Let us know the particulars about your bike as far as how it ran previously if you know.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	And if the above does not clear up the problem, then time to take the carbs off and clean the jets, betting that if it ain't water related, then it is a partially clogged main jet.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	Might have some water collected in the carb bowls. At high rpm the water gets sucked up to the main jets. There is (should be) a drain screw on the bottom of each carb. Put a small pan - or container under and open each screw a little bit. on a bike this old it probably has collected condensation in the fuel tank. happens over time. <br>  <br>  Also if you have a fuel filter - change it to new.|`|13qub401aa	How's your fuel mixture screw set?
KhbjVIx7aa	A steel rim can be knocked back into place, if it was alloy then you'dhave to purchase a new one. Under the assumption that the tech hit it back into place properly, your wheel should hold up just fine.|`|8duiF4YZaa	yes, steel wheels can be bent back, if done properly you should not have a problem, if you are getting a vibration from this wheel, even after it was repaired, you will need to replace the rim itself, and i would recommend getting the new one, being such a new vehicle, there are not going to be many of these in the salvage yards, and even used parts will not be cheap. i had a hard time finding a used rim for an 06  cobalt and the used rim  that i was able to get was bent worse then the one i had.<br>  <br>  if you are not getting any vibration or having any problems with it, i would not  mess with it|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	The problems will be, did it seat properly, (tire to rim?) you may have a slow leak and find it flat later. And when you do a rotate again the steering wheel make shake do to the bent rim. I assume he put the bent one in the back. Try looking at this site, <a href="http://www.car-part.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.car-part.com</a> and see what they get for a used rim & shipping. I think you should replace it anyway just to be safe. Good Luck.
qzyyOEYAaa	Its called a rod knock...  The shakeing is from a misfire.|`|TsJoADGPaa	Sounds like whats called valve knock. It usually means you need a rebuild of your engine. You can have it rebuilt or replaced. It would probably cost somewhere between $2000-$4000 to do. <br>  <br>  If it costs more than your car is worth, then it's probably better to just get a new car.|`|OfQwVhD2aa	Probably bent a rod in the motor.<br>  As for a rebuilt engine check out jasper engines.com<br>  or one of your local engine rebuild shops.<br>   This is going to run about $ 2000 to $3000 for another engine.<br>   Add in $ 2000 or so to change engines.<br>  Droping $ aroun $5000 in to a 98 trail blazer is not worth the $ your best bet is to find another set of wheels.|`|6gFITDoyaa	also check your oil level, some American made cars will make a knocking sound when oil is low. I know my ford ranger did it only twice along a two year period and it was right after an oil change. I just added a little oil and it was fine.|`|1Bmo1JsYaa	It sounds like these were not your friends. It is quite possible to ruin a motor quickly by the abuse you describe.

abnqs0jQaa	Well, when you are 16, you still have college and so forth before becoming a "young professional". It sounds like you have a decent budget, but obviously nothing too over the top.<br>  <br>  You mention the porsche cayenne as a vehicle "to aspire to have" kind of. As much as I don't like suggesting SUVs, this seems to be your target, and one such one to consider would be the VW Tourag (sp?).<br>  <br>  The VW is the same basic premise as the porsche as they are manufactured as part of a joint venture by VW and Porsche, and therefore share some significant aspects, in terms of shape and so forth. You might be able to get a good deal on a used one somewhere. Other than that, other SUVs might include a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Ford Explorer, Nissan Mirano, etc... There are a ton to choose from, but a better option might be given if you had an actual price range.<br>  <br>  To me, someone in business and a young professional, an SUV doesn't give off the image of young professional. Just my 2c on the matter.|`|HE23qtamaa	First of all, how will you be a "young professional" at 16? Usually, having a profession means finishing High School, and getting some sort of degree/diploma... oh ya and a job.<br>  <br>  And secondly, why do you need an SUV? Do you need to do a lot of off-road driving to get around where you live? The cost of running an SUV is so much higher, so unless you actually need it for some reason (ie you have three kids and a dog) then get a more sensible car. It can still be cool or sporty or whatever, but don't be stupid. Why waste money filling up your SUV when you could spend it on other things.|`|ilt8frKdaa	the acura MDX is nice and you can find a cheap-ish one if u look hard enough|`|qmRKVEYPaa	ugo? no really  small and safe you get what you pay for !!|`|dhvaBwFzaa	dodge durango|`|7bb0efb37d1d3c0228ce2e788f4e2555aa	SUV?

fc89b197ffdf73238dd66eb9a87062d0aa	Well, "old school" you drag out a map and plan your route! For an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight you'll use an enroute chart for Low or High altitude and the intersections, airways and navaids are all depicted along with much more. Intersections, generally, are points where radials off two VOR's cross, just like two streets crossing.<br>  <br>  Now, how you find them once you're in there air may be the main point of your question. Lot's of ways is the answer. If all you have is one VOR receiver you have to cross tune back and forth between VOR's, reading the radial (direction) off of each one to determine your position. This is all I had while flying US Army Chinooks. Next you might have two VOR's, you can then tune each one to a different station to make the process simpler. If you're equipped with Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) you can tune one VOR/DME and figure your position by the radial and distance. TACAN is similar. RNAV works off these ground based systems to give you more flexibility. GPS systems allow even greater flexibility and are very accurate.<br>  <br>  The aircraft I fly now has a Flight Management System (FMS). The FMS, like RNAV or GPS allows me to proceed directly to any point that I and or ATC desires. The FMS uses ground bases navaids, but is primarily GPS based. It has a database that has all navaids, intersections, airports, and most instrument approaches. Makes it pretty easy. We use it tactically also, we can manually input waypoints, routes and even approaches for use in the tactical environment.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Intersections can usually be located, as the name implies, at the intersection of two VOR radials. They may also be located with a single VOR and DME. And onboard RNAV equipment can also locate intersections with GPS.<br>  <br>  Intersections are not the same as VORs, but VORs can often be used to locate intersections.  For example, you could fly outward from VOR ABC on its 180 radial, then turn left when you intersect the 270 radial from VOR DEF and follow that inbound to the VOR. The intersection would be located by tuning both VORs on two different receivers and watching the needles. The point where you make your turn is an intersection.  It may or may not have a name on the charts.<br>  <br>  Airliners do this more easily, by just entering the name of the intersection into their flight management computers, which can then fly the route.  Of course, they tend to use only named intersections that the computer has in its database, although they can program the FMC for an unnamed intersection in most cases, with a bit more difficulty.
IIa4efh5aa	At this point, the smartest move probably ould e to ge the tune-up and tires and let the paint job go. A good paint job will cost more than the car is worth, and a bad paint job will highlight any flaws in the body<br>  <br>  Keep saving your money, and when the siren call of new transportation becomes irresistible, you'll be in a stronger negotiating position.|`|Nl2U569eaa	Keep the car. Since you just use it to go to school and work it should be fine for now. I would wait till you have a good solid job (which will probably happen in the next couple of years) and then save up enough down payment for a decent 2 year old car (cars depreciate in the first 2 years so i wouldn't suggest guying brand new.)Don't get a paint job. the car probably won't be worth that by the time you get rid of it.|`|03fiqGJwaa	$2000 plus the trade-in value of the sentra will not guarantee you a good used car. You know your car is solid, don't trade it in on another one that may not be.<br>  <br>  I would keep the Sentra, get a cheap paint job, or just leave it as is and do maintenance items only.

Even if kept well electrics/rubber/insulation all start to perish and rot beyond that.<br>  Cash will be king for some years to come unless we get hyper inflation (in which case you'll be glad you have the money to eat), hang on and get the bargain of your life w. the money you keep saved now in a couple of years.  I just got 4 killer speakers installed for half the price they wanted 2 years ago and would have waited more if I could still hear the old ones!<br>  You'll also kick yourself if the new second hand car turns out to require some v. expensive hidden repairs, they almost always do..|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Worry about it when the vehicle tests are due. If the cost of fixing is more than 50% of the car's worth then trash it (sorry, re-cycle it) and get another one.
ksFD7EoSaa	You have a pretty much tried and true vehicle, meaning that it has a good record of reliability. There in lies the answer, you know what you have and it has met your needs. If you elect to go for a different vehicle, you are taking the chance that the new one may not be as nice to you. Later down the road you might elect to move into a vehicle that you really want to own so for now, why not stay with what you know to be a reliable vehicle. As your financial ability increases you can pick and choose as you like. The bottom value of your nissan is almost in sight, so you really don't have much to loose.|`|r1rXE6Gtaa	I would not dream of selling it in this economy.  Save your money.

fIMzG1Ciaa	The 390 is a Ford "FE" series engine. They do make modern two piece neoprene rear main seals for them.<br>  <br>  FelPro part# BS30138<br>  <br>  You can get them from RockAuto.com for sure....but I am betting any local parts store can at least order it, if they don't already have it in stock.<br>  <br>  If you have the oil pan off, I don't think you should need to drop the tranny unless it is just in the way of removing the rear main cap. Be advised that 390's originally came with a rope seal, and getting those out of the upper (engine) half can take some talent.<br>  <br>  Here is a decent write up on that procedure:<br>  <a href="http://www.squarebirds.org/rear_main_seal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.squarebirds.org/rear_main_sea...</a><br>  <br>  If you're lucky, that 390 has already been rebuilt once and has a 2 piece seal in it, in which case you just need a drift or something similar to push out the upper half and install the new one. Be sure you oil the lip of the new one before you install it. If you install it dry you run the risk of ripping the lip on install.

No, it's not and she's suffering for it (well not now, but if she followed the rules she'd be suffering for it).<br>  <br>  Interesting dilemma. Do you do the right thing, even though it's not fair, or do you do the fair thing, even though it's not 'right'? When does one draw the line?

ksFD7EoSaa	With the question that you have I would tend to question that you have the correct tires. The rims should be stamped with the applicable width and diameter, these numbers should match the tires. If not you have a problem. Tires are built with plys that reinforce the side walls and contact surface. The more plys the tougher the tire. These plys do not allow for stretch or swelling as you put it. To install a incorrect tire on a rim can cause you physical damage when inflating the tire as it may come off or explode. Suggest you contact the manufacturer and confirm that you do have compatible rims and tires. Be safe, not sorry.|`|03fiqGJwaa	Well they could easily swell 1/2 inch overall, maybe even an inch if they're soft and you run high psi. I would not judge until you had them aired up. Tire sizes can vary in reality from one maker to the other, but on a tire that small they should only vary maybe 1/4" at most.

If you don't have a trip meter right down the number of miles you have on your car when you fill up then wait till its empty and right down that number an subtract to get the miles you traveled and divide by the number of gallons you pump in when you fill up again. Hope it helps! :)|`|kMDAjsBnaa	Ahh i see your problem.  You see, the mile is a unit of distance.  You cannot give someone "a mile."  Not even a car can give you a mile. Sure, you can give a mile of string or spaghetti, but you cannot just give a mile.<br>  Furthermore, I believe you are confused, you see, miles do not come in a gallon.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  They come in a quart.|`|AA10198728	Most accurate way would be to fill it until the gas reaches the very top (pretty much until you get a small splash out of the tank), drive it until it reaches a 1/4 tank or lower, then see how many gallons it takes to fill it back up to the very top and divide the number of miles driven since the previous fill up by the number of gallons to refill the tank.<br>  <br>  The reason that filling it to the very top is more accurate is because not all pumps will stop filling the tank at the same spot (one pump may stop with 12 gallons in the tank, another may stop at 14, heck, even using the same pump may stop at a different level).  If you fill it to the very top, you KNOW that you're filling it to the same level every time.<br>  <br>  Edit: Pumps aren't THAT inconsistent when the sensors stop the pump, I exaggerated to help emphasize why it's important to fill it to the very top (the tank has a fixed volume that will never change)|`|IeLBIACaaa	you are going to have to find out the size of your gas tank (in gallons)<br>  then fill your tank up.<br>  then reset the "trip" setting on your Odometer.<br>  Drive until your gas gauge says "low fuel" (add a gallon to your math here)<br>  then divide miles per gallon and youre all set.|`|JasyQR1iaa	Fill your tank until its full.

Fill your car up. write down what the odometer is reading, drive until you think you need to fill it up again. fill up the tank, write down how many gallons it took to fill it up. write down what the odometer is reading now, subtract what the odometer read when you first filled it up. now take that number divided by the number of gallons it took to fill it up. that is your mileage.|`|hFqcN2LFaa	find the book it tells you|`|MoUtk7cUaa	seriously?  fill the tank, reset the trip odometer, next time you fill, divide the gallons you bought into the miles you drove. the reason you don't use the 'estimated mileage' provide by the manufacturer or car sales sites is they run the car (if they actually test it) in a lab on rollers w/ no real life situations like the jackass who accelerates like a bat outta heel just to jam on the brakes at the next light.<br>  <br>  also, using the whole tank, or just about, gives a better average asw noted below not all shut offs on gas pumps are the same, but the diff is negligible if you get 12 gallons as opposed to 4.|`|AA10012975	There is a small button  on the plastic shield where it shows how fast you are going. Behind the steering wheel.You can press that and it will give you different information. Be careful to not press it down to long w/o writing down the information or it will clear it. I usually clear everytime I get a  fresh tank and keep track to make sure everything is good to go. You will usually keep the same mileage in town and get more mileage on a freeway.|`|U3j7oVflaa	If you don't have an mpg meter that you can just read from the dash, then what you need to do put in a gallon of gas, and see how long it lasts.<br>  <br>  Some ways to do this would be by filling it up from empty, note the size of the tank in gallons, reset trip meter, drive till empty (over time), and then you divide the trip meter by the size of the tank and you have it.<br>  <br>  Also if you know the size of the tank, you can take a quick proportion - fill up from half tank to 3/4ths tank, or any other segment, note how many gallons you put in and reset your trip meter, when you get back to half tank (or wherever you started), divide the gallons you put in by the miles you drove from the trip meter.<br>  <br>  If you need "highway" then do it during highway travel time, if you need "city" do it in the city, but a general indication will probably be close enough for you, I would bet.|`|DhcQC9DBaa	fill your tank up. mark down how many miles are on ur car now, then drive thru that tank. take the number of miles you have then, minus what you had. divide by how many gallons ur tank is.

hoykolriaa	With all respect to bajakma the Clarion PU-2294B(D) is not a VIN coded radio. <br>  <br>  I know this, because I've decoded them myself. Using the right radio decoding equipment, the process involves removing the CD deck to access the security chip - and reading the stored code which includes resetting.<br>  <br>  The reason why I believe you have gave the serial number is because there is certain head units that can be decoded through the serial number.  To the best of my knowledge there is no decoding software for your particular model of Clarion. They are OEM head units normally fitted to Peugeot 306, 206 and a range of Peugeot/Citroen vans.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to have a look in yellow pages for your nearest independent auto electrician / car audio shop who specialises in radio decoding and has the radio decoding equipment.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Only a dealer can get that from the manufacturer. they lock to make them useless to thieves and have no value. There is no magic unlock code other than the one that goes to your individual radio. but if it isn't attached to the correct vehicle they will not get the code for you, because they need more than a SN and a MN to get the information, the manufacturer makes then give their SS#, Dealer code, employee number.

7toznquyaa	I think it should be ILLEGAL.  (although I do it myself from time to time)<br>  Most people cannot walk and chew gum at the same time, so talking on the phone and driving in traffic is an accident waiting to happen. <br>  <br>  Yes, some are more apt than others.. but since there is no test to see who's a clutz and who isn't, then it should be illegal to do so.<br>  <br>  It should also be illegal to put your makeup on while driving, as well as trying to eat with two hands while driving... but that's another subject.<br>  <br>  If a driver is talking on the phone when they have an accident.. then it is THEIR fault, and they should be accountable for it.|`|AA11663627	I'd be OK with it being illegal. I've seen too many drivers on the road talking on their phone and meanwhile being inattentive to what's happening on the road around them. Don't get me wrong, there are going to be terrible drivers out there regardless, but cell phone use makes those terrible drivers even more dangerous. Hands-free devices should be legal though since I see no difference between those and having a passenger in your car. <br>  <br>  P.S. I'm a hypocrite since I sometimes talk on the phone while driving. Though I do consider myself to be a pretty good and attentive driver. But I will not talk on the phone when driving conditions are poor.|`|03fiqGJwaa	Yes, because people like ol' Chuck above don't realize how it affects them. They don't have the brains to realize that while it may be no more distractive than a radio or another passenger, the sum of those things are increasingly dangerous. For example, a radio is distracting at a level of 1. A radio plus a passenger is distracting at a level of 1 1/2. A radio, passenger and cell phone... well I'd give that about a 5.<br>  <br>  So, you see, those that talk on phones are, by their very nature, some of the more ignorant citizens on the streets. Therefore, it should be illegal. It really is an interesting dilemma.|`|W20KslFzaa	I can do it. So I have no problem with it for a few reasons.<br>  Talking to someone on the phone is no more or less distracting than the radio or another person sitting in the car next to you.  <br>  Regardless of if I'm talking on the phone or not, I usually drive with only one hand.<br>  For those who can't drive with one hand, they have handless devices.<br>  They don't outlaw smoking and driving, or drinking a coffee and driving, and this takes your hand away as well, so why is holding a phone so bad?<br>  ......Now, that said, if you are doing any of these things and get in an accident while doing it, I think you should be held more at fault.  But I don't think these things should be outlawed.|`|3NoQuoWuaa	It should be illegal as all get out. It removes your concentration from driving.

You mentioned its only when you turn hard, what size tires do you have? 31x10.5 inch tires on stock rims will hit the sway bar when you cut the wheel hard. Check behind your tires for any black marks on the frame/sway bar. If that's the case, you either need a lift kit, new rims with a larger offset, smaller tires or stop turning the wheel so hard.

There are 3 things that cause this.  1:  Your tires are too wide.  This is very common and when people have this problem, they never tell you that they just put oversized tires on (why that is, who knows, maybe they don't want to feel dumb).  2:  Your axle U-joints are worn out and binding.  3:  You are in 4wd on dry pavement and the transfer case is binding.

AA11346554	Since the hood opens "backward" to most cars, you have to stand to the side of the car rather than in front.  If the mechanism is rusty and needs lubricating, it may be necessary to have a person stand on the other side of the car and lift the hood with you.  Once you get it open, lube the hinges and springs and open and close it a few times to "loosen it up."  Get in the habit of opening the hood periodically if for no other reason than to keep the hinge working properly.|`|a70d82417eb7a74192f967dcdc832b20aa	That double latch thing needs to be adjusted  properly and lubed correctly to work right. They were tricky and sometimes needed two people to open hood.|`|jqaFMtVgaa	If you have pulled the hood release cable, and it either did not work, or the mechanisms did not release, you will need to release the hood from the outside of the car.  There is a cable that runs between the two catches on the underside of the hood. There is a tool that can be used to release the catches.  Look in the aftermarket catalogs. If you don't want to wait, you can try to "catch" the cable with a straightened wire coat hanger.  It is very tricky, and may take a lot of tries. Once you get it open, check all the mechanisms and the cables and find out why it didn't open.|`|7f40a0efee482e94e2baa04fac426e33aa	Ask a man to show you how.

You should look into another line of work.  <br>  <br>  I have noticed speed enforcement is going through a huge increase.  I'm sure it's because municipalities need the money.  Looks like you were just a casualty of your own carelessness.|`|nAK8bm91aa	DEFENSIVE DRIVING COURSE NOW|`|AA10860286	Let's get one thing straight for the benefit of all those anti-government folks who make the road dangerous for the rest of us. There is no such thing as a speed trap. There are speed limit signs, and cops enforcing them. There is no entrapment. Your only two options are to try and go to traffic school if you are eligible, or if you're not, try to fight the ticket. If you should manage to beat the ticket or avoid the points, you need to take a serious look at your attitude and behavior behind the wheel. Here are some absolutes: There are two kinds of drivers. Smart ones and stupid ones. The stupid ones get tickets. The smart ones don't. There are two ways to drive. The right way and the wrong way. Do it right and you will not get tickets. Do it wrong and you will get tickets.|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Now, first and foremost, I strongly suggest you slow down. After the first ticket I would think you would be more careful... like, a LOT more careful since this very situation may have been able to arise. So... bottom line for sure now, slow down, do the speed limit until at least your first ticket is removed from your record (in most places it will be taken off record after 3 years from the conviction date [this is not the date that you were pulled over]).<br>  <br>  Now I don't know where you live, nor the laws where you live. But if you have enough points to lose your license, I'd say the situation is rather grim. That being said, find a traffic ticket specialist. They are not necessarily lawyers, rather ex-cops and/or paralegals. These people will go to court on your behalf and try to fight the ticket. You will need  to pay this person more than the price of your ticket, there's no guarantee that s/he will win, and 'winning' is usually just having the fine/points reduced; you will still pay the remainder of the fine. Go see one right away; the more time they have to examine your case the better your odds.<br>  <br>  It is expensive, but you will have a shot at keeping your license. I would find that well worth the price, even if it was twice the price of the ticket. Hide nothing from the traffic ticket specialist. If you told the officer 'ya I know I was speeding' it's information the specialist will need to know and may affect your chances. Make sure you keep opinions or comments to yourself; YOU need to be honest; let the specialist bend the truth.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope you don't lose your job. Please slow down!|`|IltJCXjcaa	In Australia, that modus operandi by traffic police and other general duties police is quite lawful, so I see no reason why it wouldn't be lawful where you live. Like one of the previous people said answering this question. You have already admitted you were speeding. I think they may be looking for Pizza Cooks nearby where you live! Within walking distance.|`|5Af6j1qsaa	I don't know about your city/state, but in my city, that is illegal.  In order to pull someone over, a vehicle has to be marked (e.g., a police car).  An officer that is in an unmarked vehicle (plainclothes vehicle) can pull someone over if they are driving recklessly (e.g., a danger to the public).<br>  <br>  Officers usually don't ticket people for things that they don't see for themselves.  The "undercover" cop would have to be the one that cites you (the marked vehicle can pull you over, and then he can pull up to write you the ticket).<br>  <br>  And just so you know, the speed limit doesn't change until the moment you pass the sign.  That is why the cops picked that street.  Most regulars will know the 60 mph zone is coming up, so they'll speed up prematurely.<br>  <br>  You should look for one of those traffic lawyers.  They'll talk to the judge outside of the courtroom and work out a deal with them.

Lordy Lordy LOL|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	You will find that they will charge you 2 hours even if it only takes 1 hour.

Shops are not bound to stick to the manuals. Most of them do simply because of competition. Ask them for an estimate and if it is binding.|`|9525d359baf8efc557de889ce49b8f24aa	Oh, yes, most definitely, unless they gave you a definite guaranteed price for the repairs!|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	If they gave you a written estimate then they are going to be bound to the estimate within a certain percentage, UNLESS they discussed problems, additional repairs, before/during the time the work was performed.  Book time is generally skewed in favor of the shop, so more than likely if it is a reputable shop, they ran into legitimate problems.<br>  ***In case I offended anyone by using the word skewed, look:  The first time a mech does a two hour book time job, it might take him 3 1/2.  By the fifteenth time, he's doing it in 1 1/4.

9SgD78JIaa	Depends on the size of the vehicle and how much bigger the 6 is compared to the 4. I'm assuming you're talking about a motorcycle, since they don't make a V shape engine for a 4 cylinder, not since the 20's anyway.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to cowboy, he talks about common sense, but can't spell "cylinder" correctly.|`|PMRp2ZRlaa	It depend on gearing and overall weight of the car. (horse power to weight ratio)<br>  <br>  Good gas mileage depends on weight. Think yourself as an example (if you carry more than your weight, you use more energy and move slower, if you carry less you move faster and uses less energy.<br>  <br>  So in this theory, lots of car manufacturer sometimes put less emphasis due to automobile safety. All cars made today also carry more (convenient) options than you can think of which makes the cars overweight or carry added excess weight.<br>  <br>  Edit: So the best way to find out what car get the best gas mileage is simply know how much the cars weight and divide it with the horse power.<br>  <br>  Example 1) A 3,400 lbs. V6 car with 170 horse power.<br>  3,400 divided by 170 = 20 lbs per horsepower<br>  <br>  Example 2) A 3,000 lbs. 4 cyl. car with 150 horse power.<br>  3000 divided by 150 = 20 lbs per horsepower.<br>  <br>  So the answer of your question is that v6 or 4 cyl gas mileage is not really that much difference. If both cars weight are build stronger and with minimum options let say around 2,800 lbs. I would say that the V6 produce better gas milage then than the 4 cylinder car. Also lets not forget gear ratio (transmission gear ratio), engine ratio (cam lube or valve lifters), fuel-air ratio, and all that good stuff that makes the car runs better, and faster but burn less gas...|`|FqrKjtzwaa	The 4 cyl will always more efficient with gas but less powerful. But how much really depends on the car. In some models, there is a big difference; in others it's pretty small.<br>  <br>  In general there is no reason to get a 6 cyl for compact cars and most midsize cars, unless you really want maximum performance.|`|AA10419188	Size does not matter appreciably!  The big deal here is gearing and power distribution! This is mainly governed by "differential gear ratios"!  If you put a 6 cyl into a 4 cyl car it will  burn slightly more fuel, -- but it will be working much less, so if you do not "hotrod" all the time  difference will be small,--  If you do the same thing in reverse,- the 4 cylinder will be working harder, and thereby burn more than it would with 4 cyl gearing! <br>  <br>  If you put two cars of same make and model with the two engines (side by side) -- in factory setup,-- you may see very little difference in actual mileage!   BUT... put a heavy trailer behind, and things change quickly! Then probably the bigger engine car is best choice, as even with load it  may labor a little less to keep going!|`|Har1fZtWaa	think about that, 4 or 6 which is the bigger number... a 6 banger has 2 more cylenders burning fuel

O5CIDWqfaa	Not true.  I think they are moderate to slightly high.  I have had a water pump replaced in a 1990 model in 2002 and it was not expensive.  Things like oil filters and brake pads are standard priced.<br>  <br>  Dealer service is expensive for any car.<br>  <br>  I think the costs are less than BMW and Mercedes, probably about the same as Audi, Volvo, Acura, Lexus.  Looking up websites like Partsgeek, which sell parts for different cars, this seems to be true.<br>  <br>  The cheapest cars are probably models that are very common so that aftermarket sources are greater.  Such cars might be (guessing) Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Taurus.<br>  <br>  The Saab 9-3 and the Chevrolet Malibu share the same oil filter, which is good for Saab owners in terms of price.  I think some of the AC controls are the same.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	One current Saab is a rebadged Subaru WRX and the other I know of is a rebadgted Chevy Trailblazer.<br>  <br>  Yikes.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well I just did a timing chain on a 2.3 Saab motor and I was surprised at my cost for new parts.

SO yes they are at least WAY more than BMW parts of similar years.|`|AA10565336	As a shade tree mechanic I have found Saab and Volvo parts to be some of the most expensive when compared to the cost of the vehicle.  Most Japanese parts have come down considerably since I started doing this about 40 years ago.  I remember having to pay $450 for a little piece of junk Toyota started in 1971.  Sorry, off topic.  Yes I think your statement is a fair assessment of Saab parts in general.  Now I am discussing dealer items.  If you can get it a Kragens or Napa it will probably be priced competitively with most other vehicles.|`|abnqs0jQaa	I haven't found that to be too true. More expensive than your standard Ford, Chevy, Toyota, etc... yes. More expensive than Volvo, Acura, Audi, etc... not so much. I've found labor tends to be expensive with Saabs, as well as any other foreign luxury car, but the mechanics I've used at dealerships have been exceptional, and have actually finished jobs more timely than they quoted because they know the car well enough. Perhaps not the norm, but this has been my experience. Comparable parts from a Napa or something are cheaper than OEM, and I've found perform just as well for the most part.|`|H76IjEiPaa	A Saab seems to need more transmission repair than most cars.

Yq2CUhtYaa	Why would your insurance rocket with add ons?<br>  <br>  I have a 1988 Toyota Supra, that has a full built race engine, roll cage, etc.<br>  <br>  My insurance didn't change. And it's fully covered for the cost of the modifications. If it gets stolen, it's valued at 18,000$, rather than the $2,000 which is book value.<br>  <br>  If your insurance wants you to pay more, you should think about switching insurance companies.|`|UcXaXtrpaa	Insurance companies are usually quite good nowdays and expect most cars to be modded,example is my insurance company where i have a number of mods like a bodykit and slight engine mods and i get charged no more on my insurance for them,they told me only high engine tune modifications which really increase bhp and not small mods like exhaust and filters added extra cost,but if i was in a crash they would only replace modded parts with stock parts,unless had a like for like policy.<br>  <br>  There may be an admin charge for adding mods to a policy but that cost is better then losing the money of the car.<br>  <br>  So you are best asking your insurance company first or get someone else to ask about the same car with mods.<br>  <br>  Other issues would be if you did a mod which put steering etc at risk and aided the crash.|`|lBRud4y5aa	If you've got any sense you will declare the mods. Insurers know from experience that people modify cars and don't tell them. They thrive on it when they refuse claims. People imagine insurers are easily fooled. Trust me they are experts at sniffing out fraud, which is what it would be. Incidentally you could also be prosecuted for no insurance on a police check, especially if the police happen to mention the mods when speaking to your insurers, which they do.

JwUHCwcJaa	If the car won't kill you, the insurance will. To insure the car, you pretty much would need your whole months salary to drive one. The insurance costs get better when you're 24 or older. Slightly lesser at that age but still quite staggering. Younger people are usually hormone driven. Driving a fast car with a raging hormone level is usually not a good combination. Let the hormones settle down and maybe, just maybe, you'd be able to drive the car within the speed limit (yeah right!). Be safe!|`|P8osE8nRaa	I would say around early to mid 30's.  The first reason is that the insurance is just ridiculous if you live in any metropolitan area, and happen to be male under 25.  The second is that MSRP on an Evo in general is 33K+, in my case 40K+ for the Evo X MR, not easy making payments on a car, if you don't make a huge down payment, or have a decent job that pays well and a good credit to get financing, which are all not impossible but difficult to achieve in the early part of 20's.<br>  <br>  Even with 10K down payment, my monthly payment is over 600, with insurance around $140 a month (excellent driving records, mid 30's), so the monthly budget just on those are about $750, not to mention the premium gasoline only and synthetic oil only, etc.  Cost of ownership is not that great, but no other car really does it for me.|`|IETH9UEVaa	its not smart to have a turbo car at a young age cuz then ur insurance will skyrocket. its better to get a bit older car and after like a few years till like 25 or so then it'll be better cuz thats when ur life is pretty settled down and all. this is just all my opinion.|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	At least 24 or 25.

Fuel filter, fuel pump, spark plugs, basically doing a tune up can help out. You should be changing your fuel filter once a year.|`|MmBuqilCaa	Out of all the other answers, think about it. Just get a tune up on it and change the fuel and air filters and be done with it. If the problem is still there, it could be carbon build up on a valve. You can remove this by Driving the vehicle in low gear up to 35 or 40 miles per hour, only do this one time. If it still dose it then you will need a valve job on the heads.

a6b2a07079502be404b853573ef22aafaa	You can get power easily and without going with Bank$!! In my opinion they sell you stuff you don't really need. Their parts are nice but way overpriced for the power you get.<br>  <br>  Your truck is mechanically injected so an Edge programmer won't do a thing for you. If I remember correctly, most of your exhaust is already 3", so that won't help either.<br>  <br>  You can get a little more free power by advancing the cam plate on the P7100 injection pump.<br>  <br>  If you want more power your best bet is a TST cam plate. TST is a company owned by a retired Cummins engineer named Mark Chapple. He has power kits that are very reasonably priced and can really wake your truck up.<br>  <br>  You probably want a #12 cam plate. That will give you 230 hp and 605 ftlb.<br>  <br>  There are two other things you really MUST invest in if you're going to tow heavy and run higher than stock power. Those things are a boost and EGT gauge. Trust me you will need them. While you're towing its very important not to run over 1300 degrees pre turbo on your EGT. Running higher than that continuously is going to cause engine damage.<br>  <br>  Additionally if you have an automatic transmission you really should install a trans temp gauge. <br>  <br>  Power is nice but if you don't want to spend a lot, don't go overboard with it. Get a moderate upgrade like the 605 ftlb cam plate and all you really need in addition is the gauges.<br>  <br>  Running a higher power cam plate will result in a slipping clutch with a manual trans or slipping clutches and overheating with an auto. You'll also run into much higher EGT's as well.<br>  <br>  Making a lot of power (and towing at the same time) gets very expensive very quickly. The power kit at this point will allow the injection pump to give you the fuel, but you have to add delivery valves, lift pump, a clutch or built auto, twin turbos, o-ringed head and studs for the twin turbos, exhaust... it gets expensive quick!<br>  <br>  If you have a manual transmission (NV4500) try not to tow in 5th. These transmissions are known to have a 5th gear retaining nut problem. When heavily loaded and running high amounts of torque you can back the nut off and lose 5th gear.

9SgD78JIaa	I highly doubt it. I wouldn't mess with your vehicles computer unless you know what you're doing. I did a little reading up on it and it uses a lot mumbojumbo that sounds good to trick you into buying it. It changes the mixture that your vehicle was SET to run from the factory. This product claims the vehicle could be set to run too much or too little fuel. Since you can put it on any vehicle, how does it really know the demand your vehicle needs?<br>  <br>  I'd say stick with the old fashion fuel savers like replacing your air filter every other oil change, rotate your tires every 6,000 miles, keep your air pressure at the correct psi, change the fuel filter every 25,000 miles and a fuel system cleaning.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	99 % of the produces are useless. fitch fuel filter is one of the few gas savers that work.|`|WT9cjXtIaa	I've personally never used it (nor would I). I would think it wouldn't work the way they claim it does. A good tune-up would be your best bet. Change the plugs, air and fuel filters can save you a lot in gas and make your car run better. <br>  From the ad I saw, they say that they can get 40 MPG and 130 extra horses out of a Ford Crown Victoria. That would make the car run with Mustang GTs and get great gas mileage at the same time. Sound too good to be true? Well, that your first red flag. If it was that easy (another $28) don't you think that every manufacturer would have this on their car from the factory and then advertize these great numbers. They would sell thousands more cars. <br>  I'm sure there's some 'tweaking' every car has for better air / fuel mixture. But I would seriously doubt this can live up to the claims it makes. And additionally, if you put this on a car that is still under a warranty, you have now made the warranty void. <br>  My best advise without ever using it is to stay away. No one can make a Crown Victoria get 40 MPG and have 365 hp at the same time or Ford would be doing it.|`|otKARqPDaa	<a href="http://getinanswers.sogutonualabalik.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinanswers.sogutonualabalik.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|FqrKjtzwaa	All of these gadgets are junk and don't do anything.

If it happens again then it is something you should watch for.<br>  <br>  being that removing the fuse fixed it, I would think it might be some type of somputer, could have gotten a glitch in it after all the times it has been used and with pulling the fuse you reset it and caused the glitch to go away. <br>  <br>  that is just my thought, it is a bmw so i would think it has more of these electronics in it. <br>  I wouldn't say it was anything mechanical if it didn't happen after the fuse was pulled and put back in (assuming the a/c still works and the fuse didn't blow when being put in). <br>  <br>  It could be a shorted wire, but the same as above would typically apply.<br>  <br>  if it does it again then you should start looking into it, for now, i wouldn't worry really (just keep an eye out for any strange thing, sounds, smells, noises, etc.)

If you want to see what shape it's in then have a auto mechanic run a compression test and look over the condition of the car in general.  You can always have a rebuilt engine put in, but rust may be a problem depending on where the car has been.  <br>  <br>  Vintage cars are great, but aren't for everybody.

But they sure are cool if you don't mind those things.|`|AA10870669	You are in luck, no matter what happens is pretty cheap to fix anything on the vehicle, and best of all you can do it all your self. All you need is some good tools, a manual, and some knowledge of the engine, transmission, carburetor, etc.. However this vehicle will cost you quite a bit on gasoline even if is a small block. If is your first car is a good learning tool, but you will need to spend some money on it from time to time. Is hard to say how much because who knows how your cousin drove it. At the Famous Jackson auction they sell for thousands, but they are really worth only 100 or 200 bucks.

AA12095978	it is not a common practice, in fact, in order for a spring to break, you need to be doing a lot of very rough driving, daily and frequently, and even then a spring won't go bad.<br>  maybe after 20 years they might start to sag a little big, but do not let them push you into replacing them.<br>  don't let them pull a line like they aren't compressing at the right whatever, it's all bunk and designed to make you pay more for something you don't need.<br>  <br>  In fact, you should have your shocks replaced somewhere else, so you won't pay as much,and you will get a higher quality shock.<br>  <br>  I recommend going with KYB GR-2, which will give you an upgraded ride from the original equipment, you won't be disappointed with them.<br>  If you tow or haul a lot, or drive fast, take corners fast, etc.. go with gas-a-just shocks.  they're a bit stiffer and will give better handling with those characteristics.<br>  they cost less than the dealership shocks, and have a lifetime warranty, as well as getting much more bang for your buck.<br>  <br>  If anything, find them at a local auto parts store, and goto a tire shop, like Big-O or wheel works, for instance, they'll install them for a lot less, as shocks are very easy to replace, and require very little labor, unlike struts.<br>  <br>  Your Explorer does not have struts and does NOT need an alignment afterwards, although having an alignment once a year is recommended.<br>  <br>  Stay away from Monroe shocks, they're ok shocks, they just don't last as long as they used to and don't give the ride they used to.<br>  Gabriel is good, you can get those from autozone, get the middle shock if you go with these, they also have a lifetime warranty.<br>  <br>  The dealership simply wants you to spend more money and they are getting creative in finding ways to do that.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	If the springs broke change it, but if not just change the shocks and be done with it.

Even if it seems to be working, take it off and look at it. More than likely, it is getting clogged. You can either clean it and replace it or install a new one.<br>  <br>  The engine running better when it's cold indicates that your idle control is working fine. It opens up to allow more air to keep a higher idle when the engine is cold. More air is helping the blockage be less noticeable.|`|AA12095978	on subaru's the tires MUST always match.  the transfer case system can not handle different tires, it adds stress to the system. the system also does not like uneven tire wear, like the front tires having less tread than the rears.  that's stress too.  the system is very good, but this quirk to me makes it a mess.<br>  constant tire rotations help a lot.<br>  <br>  back to your problem.. the vacuum system is more than the EGR valve, there's a pressure sensor, vacuum sensor and hoses.<br>  you have to start breaking everything down.  clean the egr valve, and the hoses.  you probably just have a high carbon buildup and it's blocking flow.<br>  take the egr valve off, clean it, and make sure it holds vacuum.<br>  spray lots of carb spray into the base where the valve bolts down on.<br>  <br>  you might want to consider decarbonizing your engine.  Use Seafoam for that, it works very well.  But goto Youtube and type in Seafoam for a video of what it does.  it looks very bad, but in 30 minutes, your engine will breath much easier!
