BNPMxfeDaa	This whole situation is so sad. I feel bad for you. Yes, you made a mistake, disobeying your parents by being alone with your bf but it's time to pony up and take responsibility. You are acting immaturely about keeping the baby and the way you handled the whole rape thing, but your parents didn't help much by being jerks. You didnt cause it, it's not your fault. I think you need some good advice and maybe your sister can give it to you. If you think you want to keep this baby, you will need to realize mom and dad aint gonna babysit, nor let you live in their house. You need to get real about how you're gonna take care of it, pay for diapers, rent, etc. and I think you need a cold hard look at the situation. If you're too pregnant for an abortion, you need to consider adoption. I do wish you the best of luck.|`|ejelObdJaa	u should deff report it to the police department ! ... why are ur parents like that? if we wanted peoplee to rape us it wouldnt be called a rape. when u get raped, u get sexually abused; which means u didnt want to. since u r so young & u didnt have sex because u wanted to then id say u should abort it.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	YES!<br>  Dont let him get away with this crime.<br>  It was no your fault, you cannot help what happened to you.<br>  He overpwoered you!.<br>  Press charges !<br>  <br>  Good luck to you. !!|`|Uoukx6Pdaa	Yes you should but unforunally your going to need your parents help. Unless they sign legal rights to your sister. Also if you can prove it all and that that guy is the father then he will be forced to fork over money when the baby comes unless you have him sign off the rights.|`|sMuMfuAgaa	I definately think you should press charges but on the whole abortion or keeping the baby thing...maybe you should consider adoption.It'd make things easier on you but your parents would also get their way.Oh and I suggest that if your best friend doesn't already know, that you tell her.And talk things out with your parents.It is NOT your fault you got raped that where the whole definition initself comes in..."forced".

No one on this site can advise you ...........Call the doc and make an appointment to clarify this .|`|AA10458750	Your Dr. should have told you and given you a diet to follow.....you need to go back and ask.
8RLGcshUaa	I want to say no you aren't b/c you shouldn't have a period if you were pregnant. On the other hand it has happened before,and some people do have periods. I'm on the fence. Wait until it has been 2 weeks after you had sex and take a pregnancy test, which would be soon.|`|d24443b8ec2e2ad458375b4a24f5d89eaa	Protection is just that. If it didn't  break, it's probably stress and other factors like the flu. Trust me. I just had a long pregnancy scare. If you're worried, a test is accurate 19 days after sex.|`|oZPtaJPKaa	Umm, that's not a sign of pregnancy, but if you're concerned, take a pregnancy test. You can even get them at the dollar store for a buck.|`|YQoBbVntaa	no if you got your period that mean you are not pregnant but it seems you are getting sick though :(|`|H2IhRXIIaa	No your good!!!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	It doesn't sound like you're pregnant. It sounds like you're getting sick.
qv493CGiaa	Tell him how serious you are about him changing and getting his act together and if he doesn't change after that then you're going to leave him then if he does carry on, leave him. Do you really want your baby to grow up in an environment like that? B/c babies DO pick up on these things v. early in age. Hunny, if he really loves you, then he WILL change for you. Good luck to you and your baby :)|`|GbiFRG5eaa	Nothing can or will be resolved whilst you two are together. No trauma in life warrants someone being aggressive to another, far less a person they purport to love. <br>  For your peace of mind and the welfare of your pregnancy you need to break away whilst he sorts his problems out.You are not "leaving" him you are simply doing what is best for all three of you. This should really galvanise him to get the proper help he needs and if it doesn't then you will realise he talks a good solution rather than finding one.<br>  Please realise that this problem if not dealt with now, will only worsen when the baby arrives. A new baby, especially a first one can put enormous strain on the most settled of relationships. In a relationship where there are issues these are magnified and can cause untold harm to all concerned.<br>  You owe it yourself, your baby and him to remove yourself from this situation till he has proved he has overcome his anger issues.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	first of all this anger management will most likely fail.....because he needs to do it for himself and want to be that better person. something is on his mind...maybe he just isnt ready for all of this? and feels trapped now that your having his baby like hes losing control....you need to have a talk with him in a calm environment. if he persists this way id leave before things get physical!|`|AA11066099	LEAVE HIM!!! OR ARE YOU JUST WAITING FOR HIM TO CONTROL YOUR OWN LIFE???|`|zaRcsUwNaa	For your own safety and that of your baby i urge you to get him to  leave ,if he wants to go to anger management he needs to leave you alone until he can prove he feels better,if he has only just started to behave like then he needs to talk to someone ,as there could be am underlying reason ,but never the less you must distance your self and have someone in the next room when you do be gentle but firm at this time you must think of both of your welfare take care.|`|ESXYxYKCaa	This is so wrong. Just say to him "I am pregnant, and in these times we shouldn't be arguing - This attitude will carry over to the baby, atleast for the child's sake if you love him/her. This is reprehensible behaviour and request him to calm down otherwise he would something equally wrong in future"<br>  Hope things get along well|`|AA11612672	Dump him and put the baby up for adoption. Then move on with your life.<br>  <br>  Remember, if you keep the baby, it will have a horrible daddy.<br>  <br>  No matter how much you hope he will change after the baby is born, he won't. He will always be a jerk. Quit fooling yourself by thinking the baby will make him a better person. It never happens that way. NEVER.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	You need to stay away from him until he gets help. You do not need to be around this kind of stress while you are pregnant, and your baby definitely does not need to be around that kind of behavior after he/she is born. So tell him GET HELP! or stay away.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	if you don't like the way hes acting around you now maybe you need a bit of space from him. by him treating you badly it can cause you to get stressed and been stressed can harm the baby. think about whats best for you and the baby :) good luck|`|vygYFdsSaa	It might be time for you two to take a break. You don't want to risk him hurting you and the baby. Seems like he's having a hard time adjusting to a non-long distance relationship. I'm sorry for what's happening to you|`|ZiC2hGm4aa	Get the hell out of the relationship. No matter how much he says he will change. He won't.|`|ajOlzSJ1aa	I guess he is in a panic about becoming a father and all the responsibility it will heap on him.<br>  he sounds way too immature, and I would think carefully about your relationship.<br>  He may mellow once the child is born.|`|fFpCAG1Jaa	my dad is the same around my mum, my mum said it started when i was born, just break up with him before it gets worse and he takes it out on the baby<br>  <br>  you don't want the baby to turn out with scars like me<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  matt aged 14|`|r2EwT0QHaa	Just remember two perants are better than one|`|L4r1kmPQaa	Break up with him if you don't like how he's acting right now.|`|UywxrfGdaa	you shouldn't let any 1 talk to you badly. verbal abuse is just as bad as violent. to me when men are like that they have issues of there own that only they can sort out. if you have been with him 2 years then it should show him that you support and love him and so he should treat you with love and respect you deserve. YOU ARE GOING TO BE THE MOTHER OF HIS CHILD!! it takes 2 to pull there weight in a relationship and parenting so don't be wasting time if he hasn't changed when his baby is born. if his abuse carries on you need to get the hell out of there taking your baby with you! the more you tolerate it girl the more difficult it will become to get out of it because he will smash your confidence up with his verbal abuse. ive been there! grief is a funny emotion but there is no excuse to treat a pregnant woman in such a way. he sounds like he needs grief counselling and to learn to let go of all the hurt he is feeling.  be strong now but  the more crap you take and the less you stand up for yourself the worst you will feel. take care x|`|jd14u32qaa	If he's going anger managment FOR YOU, then he will eventually RESENT you for making him change, even you aren't making him do it, he sees it as doing it BECAUSE OF you.  Best thing you could do, take a break until he gets himself straightened out FOR HIMSELF, then make a decision about moving forward together or apart.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	leave him,u have the baby to think of. tell him he is welcome to a part in his childs life if he can change but u cannot bring a baby into that kind of situation. it just isnt fair.

Mg2lohdIaa	I did it is the wat it is|`|7XfH78muaa	I went all natural with my first and altough at the time it was painful I did not remember any of it and when I found out I was pregnant with my 2nd swore it would be a breeze to do again well Boy was I wrong after a few contractions I wimped out and took the epidural so I guess each time is different and either way you go its a lot of work.Oh and your sister in-law might have screamed cuz the medicine wore off it happens.|`|PvnnWE1Baa	Every woman is different & so are their bodies. Some can take pain waaay better than others. Some don't like pain at all. You can't compare everyone's labor.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	There are a few reasons I didn't want pain meds. The main one being I have naturally low bp (like 90/60 usually if not lower) and pain meds can lower bp further, esp epis. That's dangerous for a baby. I also didn't think the risks of an epi outweighed the possible benefits. And some of the pain meds (demerol for ex) don't neccessarily take away the pain, just make it so you're less caring about it or can do less about the pain. I did not want to be flat on my back or in a bed for my whole labor either. And I was planning on bfing and didn't want to add any more possibly difficulties (because babies can come out drugged) to that. As it was I was induced and they almost had to do an ER c-section, and they were squeezing IV's into me to boost my bp to help blood get to my dd. I shudder to think what would have happened if I couldn't feel to push to get her out, or if my bp had dropped lower because of an epi or pain meds. (BTW, I was already 4 cms dialated and 80% effaced and lived 1 hour away from the birth center. My mom had a 4 hour first labor so I went with induction to avoid giving birth on the side of the road lol.)|`|vL4rOD5Yaa	I wanted a natural birth throughout my 1st pregnancy but in my birth plan I did put if I really needed it Id like gas and air available I didnt want an epidural at any cost as I wanted to be able to get up after etc. I didnt think I had a very high pain threshold so with all the horror stories you hear I expected to need the gas and air. But I went on to surprise myself and my husband by having a natural birth it was after the birth I needed stitches as I had a 2nd degree tear that I did need the gas and air as this was the most painful bit for me but my baby was born a healthy 9Ib 2.5 ozs so to be expected Im now expecting again in may and have an identical birth plan as my last one went so well .|`|c6eee8ca32c8596d205d0a16a9898eb0aa	This is my first and I want to go natural no epidural because i notice woman who get it end up not being able to push when it comes time becaus ethey cant feel their legs and alot of people i know said in the end you begin have back problems.. another woman i knew got an epidural and went to push and the baby was coming wrong and they had to end up doing an emergency c section.... sucks so i plan to do the natural way...|`|DiuDO1Weaa	as for me i did not decide well i did but didnt i wanted one but by the time it was ready to push it was to late the dr i had was a dumbass and said i needed to deal with the pain although i didnt care what his opinion was i was just about ready to get one and i went from 3 an a half centameters to a full ten lol this time i,m getting one because my tubes have to be clamped,and your SIL i don't think she had a very high pain tolerence or she just thought she was still in so much pain but i don't know why she would still be screeming? wierd you should ask her|`|QM6wiVtVaa	People have different levels of pain tolerance. You shouldn't look down on people who have had an epidural, just like they shouldn't look at you like you are crazy for NOT having one.<br>  Some women's contractions are worse than others, as well.<br>  <br>  Everyone is different, every pregnancy is different, being a mother you should know this.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	Sometimes the epidural doesnt take and you can feel the birth. I had an epidural with both my children. The first time I didnt feel a thing and the second time my epidural wore off and I felt everything. I screamed too.|`|3dSCbIcEaa	I had both my babies at home with my midwife and it was beautiful both times.:) I got that look all the time and i had plenty of people say "u must be crazy".  The reason i chose homebirths is bc i wanted the entrance to the world for my baby to be gentle and comfortable.  I didnt see that happening at the hospital.  I suppose the reason many women think u r "crazy" is bc they are too afraid to reach inside themsleves and do what they r made to do as women, and u r not.  Thats my theory anyway. <br>  About your sil having her baby on the epidural and screaming her head off- i guess everyone is different and im not sure how epidurals work, but i heard that they dont take away the pressure. Imagine giving birth (youve done it before, right) and not really feeling what is going on other than extreme pressure.  I think i would scream too.  That, and she was prob laying on her back in a bed---thats not natural so it must be pretty uncomfortable.<br>  Oh well, Good Luck to you and thank God for u!!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Maybe your sister was scared. Don't know. I'm getting one though. It's your choice. Good luck.

dWnN7mBPaa	I found my keys in my daughters closet once, <br>  <br>  -Other possibilities<br>  Dresser drawers, <br>  toilet......<br>  Cabinets<br>  toys with compartments<br>  toy box...|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Toy box. Or ask her. <br>  <br>  So heres my story- My husband, My daughter and I went out shopping so i left my wallet at home. When we got back the front door was open a little bit ( now i know my husband didnt close it all the way) so i quickly looked in my wallet- my dept card was gone. I was freaking out we live a in a rather small town and this kind of stuff doesn't happen. Well I called, canceled it. The next day i called my husband and told him i need to go get some grocery's so i needed his card. As i said it, my darling little daughter walks over to her toy box, opens one of her play lunch box and hands me my debit card. My husband then remembers that the morning before we went shopping when I was in the shower he let out daughter play with my wallet.|`|YKVvojF2aa	To think like a 2 year old???  Hmmm lets see... this is sooo common lol!!!   2 year olds want to imitate.  so...look in similar items of your childs in which would look like where you keep your cc and id.  A wallet could be anything honestly, a purse could be a bag, pillowcase, anything as well, a check book or a wallet that has a check book in it could be a regular book, a cd case, a dvd case, or check his/her own pockets.  I carry stuff in my pockets and my husband carries his wallet in his back pocket, my son who is 2 1/2 likes to place everything i his pockets.  Under the couch is a culprit in my house.  My son also hides stuff that he is not suppose to have (like a pacifier) between his mattress and box spring.  Inside of his shoes is a place for small toy cars.  I have found stuff in my pockets inside of dirty clothes hamper (his flash cards), and then the trash.  A 2 year old likes praise, so something on the floor that does not belong is usually trash or a toy in my house, so I always check the trash.  For your ID check a photo album.  I show my son pictures all the time and if we are given a picture of someone he always gets the photo album out to try and put it in there.  That is about all I can think of.  I am very sorry to hear this, but all parents are chuckiling on the inside because we have all been there before.  Try the find mommy's stuff game, "who has mommy's id and other cards, do you know where they are?  can you help me find them?  where could my cards be hiding?  I need someone special and big to help me?  are you a big boy/girl?  since you are can you help me find the cards that are hiding from me?" these kinds of questions might help...good luck to you!!!|`|JAKvotuZaa	These are my son's favorite hiding places. In the couch cushions, inside the seat of his riding toy, In other bags or purses lying around, in the recycling bin, in any cupboard or drawer. Oh and his favorite is in under the couch and our couch is really heavy! Good Luck!|`|AaoclPYCaa	My grandson did that to my daughter with her car keys one time.  She finally found them in a cookie box.|`|8dpZpH0Saa	"I have a butt, Im hungry."<br>  Haha
ZLpgjLPyaa	From what I know you have a higher risk of gestational diabetes and miscarriage. The daibetes is because some women with pcos have an insuling problem and when you are pregnant and gaining weight you can be more susceptable to GD. Also the miscarriage factor shows up with pcos when you have progesterone issues. As long as your dr knows you have pcos everything should be fine, just watch you sugar/carb intake and dont go overboard. Good luck.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	There is little risk of getting pregnant without additional fertility assistance.<br>  There is a great chance of getting pregnant as long as appropriate help is sought.  <br>  Considering the category (TTC) I believe you meant to say 'chance' and not 'risk.'|`|Eo07UMsRaa	Well, from your question I guess you're pregnant now and you have PCOS? If so, there is nothing that will put your baby at risk?
AA10976444	As long as your HCG and progesterone levels are good, you are fine.  You can have a vaginal u/s this early...you should be able to see a sac and a beating heart.  I had a blighted ovum that was found at 9 weeks.  Mine never miscarried on its own, I had to hae a d&c to clean it out.  You need to relax...stress isn't good for you or the baby.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Yes your going to have cramps because its your uterus stretching to help with the growing baby. So you need to calm down and relax your stress isn't good for the baby
IOU6zo9Raa	I remember those things happening. It's too earoly for you to be having your baby, but it is probably just your baby descending farther into your pelvis to prepare for birth. you could also be experiencing braxton hicks contractions if it feels like cramping. the shooting pain is definatly baby moving down.|`|AA11784984	I could be her head pressing down and rubbing on your pelvic area.

And kids can come up with pretty rude nicknames like I've had Fanny (not as in the old fashioned name but as in the woman's body part) and Stiffy Tiffy pertaining to a man's erection. Doesn't really hurt your feelings and make you cry but gets quite annoying after a while. Other than that it's not a bad name I'm just giving you it from my point of view before you name her Tiffany if you do. I guess its not really my choice and if you do name her that she may not get nay of that, she won't get any of it if she does until she's I estimate in about year four. Oh by the way my middle name is Alice so you could put that down as a middle name for it I think it flows well.|`|1vTIDTOaaa	1.Isabella Marie<br>  11.Summer Rose<br>  12. Selena Grace<br>  13.

CKnHMYHnaa	To 'May I help you'?  <br>  Your answer is 'Nothing' huh?  Well, with all do respect, what do you know about it?  If you think there isn't a higher risk with multiples then you are living in a land of naivety and must be blessed to still have your pregnancy innocence. <br>  The weight of twins caused my cervix to shorten prematurely and I went into pre-term labor at 21 weeks. Since you seem to be an expert, then you know that this is too early for babies to be born and they died 20 minutes after I delivered them.  All the hopes and dreams I had for their future were instantly destroyed and my life will never be the same.  <br>  My intent isn't to scare anyone, but if someone had informed me of potential risks then maybe my tradgedy could have been prevented.  Telling others that everything will always be fine is not helping anyone.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i dont have twins but i would think one bad think is when they try to do them in vaginal birth deliver one  7still have to do a csection<br>  i would think this would be bad because you have to heal in both places|`|AA10987701	Nothing.<br>  You may stretch more, but the body is amazing.<br>  <br>  However, the worst part comes later -<br>  feeding 2 at the same time<br>  and 2 sets of diapers to change every 2-3 hours when they are nursing, and nursing provides the best protection that they need,<br>  and crying, so one crying may wake up the other, then you have<br>  2 babies crying.<br>  2 sets of clothing,<br>  2 sets of college tuition<br>  <br>  You are blessed double, and I hope you have a great digital camera that takes video as you will have their memories forever.<br>  Please don't listen to anyone who may try to scare you.<br>  Listen to your doctor, and you will be fine.<br>  Take your prenatal vitamins and eat very well!<br>  Don't forget to rest & take power naps when you need them.<br>  Take people up on their offers to help you when they offer before<br>  & after your children are born.  Relax as much as you can.<br>  There are great books on child development from conception<br>  to help you learn what's happening - and sometimes the doc's<br>  office has them.<br>  <br>  Take all of your questions & fears to your doc after you write them<br>  down so you can get the professional help for the best answers.<br>  Please don't take any scarey advice from a website.<br>  A good site is mayoclinic site for health questions.<br>  <br>  GOD bless us always.<br>  MBA-Boston <br>  MBA-Boston Univ.<br>  CPA-desired|`|CuCrGDuRaa	The worst part is the increased risk of complications.  You have a higher chance of needing an emergency c-section, a very long labor, and postpartum hemorrhaging.  For me, I'm nervous they will come too soon and will have to stay in the NN-ICU after they are born.  Good luck with your twins!

aNGzulgpaa	My daughter is going to be 3 years old next week and weighs 22 pounds.  She is very active and very smart, and a normal 3 year old in every other way.  I am very familiar with all the tests, and mine as well have all come back fine, just that she has some trouble absorbing the nutirents and calories from her food the way most people do.  So she is on Benecalorie, and it seems to help.  She has progressively put on a pound a month for the past 3 months, so it seems to be of help since before she went several months with no weight gain.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.....and good luck wihth your tiny one.....they are miracles!|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Is she absorbing all the calories from food? Have you done a food diary and seen a dietician? These are all steps to take.<br>  <br>  Also, before doing benecalorie, you could try Ensure or resource for kids.

a1uoxczTaa	there is a chance of miscarrying within that first month. most miscarriages happen around then when most mothers didnt even know they were pregnant in the first place!|`|ojUrCJi7aa	I am guessing (I am not a doctor) that you were never pregnant in the first place. If your period is on time then chances are slim and the fact that it was heavy too. Some people have slight spotting around the time their first period was due, very light period. However, in very extreme circumstances you can have a period every month for your whole pregnancy, like my Mum. If you are at all worried then go to doctor! Or if you wanna know for sure then get a pregnancy test, the pregnancy hormone levels stay in the body for about 5 days after a miscarriage or if you are still pregnant. If it comes up positive then you either are or were! I am waffling a bit now but I think you should go to your doctor, if you hav had a miscarriage they need to check you out to make sure it has all come away. I hope it was just a false alarm and good luck in the future!|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Most likely if the bleeding begin at the time your period was due, you didn't miscarry.  You just weren't pregnant, maybe next time.  Good Luck|`|yp9rEMSraa	yes there is a chance that you could have miscarried...You would never know that you were actually prego cause it was too early to test...doctors say it is common and the woman will never know...if there is a change in your period that might be the case or you body was getting ready for a pregnancy but something just didnt turn out right and you got your period....my period has been light and heavy on certain months....all happening when TTC<br>  Best of luck to you and baby dust
pOekC2Sqaa	Even though I'm normally not a huge fan of names after countries/cities I think Vienna is a gorgeous name for a little girl. Vivi would be a cute nickname. <br>  <br>  Even though I like it, I probably wouldn't use it. It just doesn't seem the type of name that will grow with the child. It's gorgeous though - don't get me wrong.<br>  <br>  I'd probably rate this name an 8/10. <br>  <br>  Hmm... I like Vienna Rose, Vienna Helen, Vienna Paige, Vienna Peyton, Vienna Mae, Vienna Grace, Vienna Marie and Vienna Elise.<br>  <br>  Hmm... I image a girl with big blue eyes, and dark black hair, and a pale skinned complexion. She's full of life, but hides her bubbly nature with a more serious facade and books. She loves to read. She's more of an indoor girl but enjoys horse riding immensley. She's quite popular, though has 5 or 6 close friends. Due to her nature she keeps the group together.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and that this is what you wanted<br>  <br>  G2B|`|rbqvDZyxaa	1. Yes it's unique without being too much so, the kid will be able to say it and spell it easily. It's also very pretty. <br>  2. Probably not but that doesn't mean it isn't nice. I'd probably name my daughter something like Autumn Lily (I'm into weird names)<br>  3. I dunno 7/10 <br>  4.Evalina, Rebecca, Lilly, Julianne, Michaela, Jane, Sophia, Alice, Rose, Addison, Sage, Sorrel, Alanna, Celandine, Charlotte, Audrey, Jodie. <br>  5.  I really don't know, pretty I think as it's a pretty name. Probably not a hugely sporty person but more academic. With a wide circle of friends but not the popular one, very quiet and polite too, shy if you want to describe it like that. Probably likes dancing ballet that sort of thing.|`|CgI7JAmdaa	1.

It's been such a pain.  And I had trouble getting security clearance.  And constantly getting letters and phone calls for "Mr." gets really, really old. <br>  <br>  Just because parents are crazy these days - naming boys after girls, girls after boys, and everyone after dogs - dooesn't mean you should :)|`|gf5ysBCnaa	Why not its terrible enough.|`|oqhF2Gsaaa	sure.i dont think anyone would tease her, some people are so mean.<br>  i know a girl called mackinley. i think anderson is way better than that lol.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	That's not too bad. Call her Andi.

Also, Morgan is a surname and so is Blake. Although Blake can be used as a first name for a boy, not a girl. Opposite sex names leave a child open to teasing at school, I know because I use to pay out on such kids when I was the school yard Sith Lord from hell.

bT4npA7Jaa	I think the name Daisy goes great with your other kids names. I know it's not up there, but I thought I'd let you know. Daisy Grace is cute. And Isabella Grace is really cute too. For a boy I like all of the names, but I'd swap them. Asher Oliver has to many "er" sounds in it and doesn't flow at all. Jaylon Samual is good. I would spell it Jalon Samuel though. Or may Asher Samuel and Jaylon Oliver :)<br>  <br>  I still hope you like Daisy Grace Singer<br>  <br>  That sounds really good as a name, as well as with your other childrens names.|`|X9T9iVVhaa	Girl: Isabella Grace is beautiful.

sk46uigvaa	Im not trying to be rude or anything but according to your questions you've been ttc since you were 17 !!...not to mention haven't been in a regular relationship for very long??<br>  <br>  isn't that abit 'pot calling the kettle black'???<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways hope you get your little bundle of joy soon x|`|ITfBQzg6aa	You have no idea how pist i get when i hear these 13 14 15 16 17 year old girls that don't even know how to wipe there *** talking about getting pregnant and do very very quickly and us older ones that are ready and waiting we have a lot of trouble even ovulating.. Ugh|`|u5BK6471aa	What really annoys me is when im trying for over 8 months to get preg when my friend goes off the pill for a week on purpose, gets preg and then aborts it coz thats what everyone tells her to do.|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	i can understand your feelings, not with 13-16 year olds but sister-in-laws that married 2 years after i did and are having kids right and left, one is having her second while i don't have any yet!|`|TY2v2lkLaa	I had my son when I was 18, he was planned!!! I wouldn't change it for the world! 13-17 year olds have a harder time raising babys, it doesn't mean they are going to be bad mothers! I go to a teen parents meeting every month for support still and im 21 now, everymonth there is a new pregnant teen in there but you know what, they get hooked up with a mentor, at least their trying to get help instead of dumping babies in toilets or garbage sacks. We are ttc #2 and I think its very frusterating how some woman can have "accidents" and get pregnant the first time having sex, my husband and I have been trying for 6 months! Its just life ladies|`|e7SYtaIJaa	It took my wife and I 1.5 years to get pregnant, and that was after a miscarriage at 8 weeks. It is frustrating, but the human body slows down a little when we get older. And my wife was on the pill for around 8 years. 13-16 year olds shouldnt be having babies full stop. All those kids will know is raising kids, with no life experience.|`|wWkfASTNaa	I dont get really angry about it, because I see babies as a blessing. I think these little girls need to be better educated about pregnancy and parenting and on more ways to prevent pregnancy, that way someone who is in no way prepared to have a baby will not be having them,|`|yp9rEMSraa	yeah i know it is like they have no clue about what is going on in the world.....i think like the whole baby thing is just to tell there girl friends hey i have a baby...this is so crazy and stupid...when i was that age that was the last thing on my mind....this is crazy what are these girls thinking!!!|`|UqJkx1nhaa	You couldn't have said it more better. They will all have a reality check. Parenthood is a blessing and I love it BUT IT'S HARD AT TIMES!!! They are so young that they don't understand. It's not going to keep the guy around.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Yes very angry. I don't like the way a lot of us have to TTC for a while whilst teens seem to be able to stumble in to pregnancy naively.|`|p0prrzf2aa	no ha. because when they get pregnant it's not a blessing, it's a "mistake" or an "accident".<br>  <br>  but when people like you get pregnant, it's a  BLESSING :)|`|ROJans2Taa	I understand what your saying, however I was that 16 year old that got pregnant, my mom nor anyone else raised her though, all me and my husband, no welfare no unemployment just old fashioned hard work, I did find when I tried for my second 6 years later it seemed to take longer then I thought, I was under the impression, go off pills, have unprotected sex and get pregnant, I was sooo wrong, I have my 6 mth old now, but was definitely feeling frustrated at hearing everyone else getting pregnant when I was trying so hard. wishing you the best!

N5EhfDX2aa	Coco is a quite nickname for your daughter, but not suitable for a first name. What about Caroline or Cleo as her name? <br>  <br>  Audrey does feel like an older name doesn't it? Slightly fresher alternatives are Aubrey or Audrena or one that popped up recently Adrianne. Another name I like is Andrea.<br>  <br>  Scarlet is gorgeous but I prefer it Scarlett haha sold on you now? Or you could make it a bit different by putting an a on the end, Scarletta? Its actually more popular than you think.<br>  <br>  Stella I'm not keen on, better as a nick name. What about Estelle or Estella?<br>  <br>  Mia is alright, I prefer Myra =] Friend of a good mate of mine, its very very old fashioned but I think its really cute!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  SUGGESTIONS<br>  Caroline<br>  Cleo<br>  Audrena, Audrina<br>  Aubrey<br>  Adrianne, Adrianna<br>  Scarlett, Scarletta<br>  Estelle, Estella<br>  Myra|`|O53iumPZaa	im sorry but i feel bad for anyone named Coco. i HATE that name<br>  <br>  Audrey is nice. sounds girly not old. i like it!<br>  <br>  Scarlet is such a pretty name. the name is just so soft and gentle. love!<br>  <br>  Stella..ugh nah. i dont like that name.<br>  <br>  Mia is very cute! <br>  <br>  Ava is also nice but a bit commen.   Eva or Eve are also nice names.<br>  <br>  i LOVE the name Noah for a girl. also Rosalie and Naomi are pretty names:)|`|Uq54V5EWaa	I like Audrey<br>  <br>  Mia ia awsome<br>  <br>  But what about Gabriella or Molly<br>  <br>  Hope you find a good one!|`|YzUQMXJ0aa	Coco is kind of cute for a little girl, but I think it's better for dogs.<br>  <br>  Audrey is very classy of course, because of Audrey Hepburn. So I like it.<br>  <br>  Scarlet is ok, but I don't particularly like thinking about the character from Gone with the Wind. I prefer the name Charlotte (which kind of sounds like Scarlet).<br>  <br>  Stella was my great-grandmother's name, and I sometimes wish I were named after her. It's really dramatic and uncommon. <br>  <br>  I don't like the name Mia. at all. <br>  <br>  I think that the names Lily and Noelle are cute.|`|JsIwxjnBaa	personally, i think the first four you mentioned are a little... weird haha :) <br>  --mia is adorable, especially for a cute little girl <br>  --and so is sophia. if you like sophie, then it's still a cute variation<br>  <br>  enjoy, good luck|`|UIILEn0Uaa	I really love the name Audrey, and it's not very common right now,<br>  I also think AUBREY is cute, because to me its more feminine(:<br>  <br>  You are right, Audrey is a good grown-up name, but Aubrey is good from both little girl and big girl(:|`|6OplSEQkaa	Coco is my ex boyfriend's name.<br>  I hate Audrey.<br>  Scarlett is pretty.<br>  Stella is beautiful.<br>  Mia is my name!<br>  Ava Lily, the name in your other question, is pretty too.<br>  <br>  How about Danielle?|`|LZAF4DYZaa	I think they're all pretty cute!!!

My daughters name is Chesney and have never heard of another one.|`|IfIIrCMzaa	Coco is a dog's name..not really for a little girl.<br>  Audrey is nice, but it sounds like an old name.<br>  Scarlet is okay.<br>  Stella isn't too too bad.<br>  Mia is a really cute name, i like it. <br>  <br>  But i've always loved the name Cheyenne. it's an original name that not many people have <br>  hope i've helped :)|`|HRtMBBwCaa	I like Coco, but, I  think of David Arquette and Courtney Cox<br>  I don't like Audrey, it's old<br>  Scarlet is very pretty, but, it might be over used in the next few years.<br>  Stella is great, but, people might quote from Rocky and yell for her..<br>  Mia is ok.......but, a lot of girls with longer names use Mia for short.<br>  <br>  I love the name Halen (like Van Halen, the band)! It is great, good for a girl that is little or big.....<br>  I also like Emerson for a girl.......I have an Emalee and I call her Emerson all the time.<br>  Piper is really cute, and my Emalee was almost a piper, but she was blonde.<br>  I also have a daughter named Love-names of virtue are great. Love's best friend's name is Trinity. Very cute. <br>  My great grandmother's name was Evanell and I wish I would have used it for my girls someway. <br>  <br>  This is my list-----naming a baby is the best and worst experience in motherhood! I have done it 3 times and it was soooooo hard!<br>  (I have a boy also, he is a Jonathan)|`|G0KEMulSaa	i dont like coco, i think its too "out there"<br>  i like audrey(or even aubrey)<br>  i dont like scarlet(her nickname would probably turn into scar , and who wants to call a cute little girl SCAR)<br>  i dont like stella, (it reminds or someone old working on a farm)<br>  i reallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy like mia alot<br>  i also like ,as a suggestion,, or giavonna|`|nOzQUsToaa	Coco Ava sounds very cute, I'd go with it. Also, how about Mia Scarlet or Audrey Stella? I love all the names you picked they'te beautiful.
DkVqOe8Iaa	Ava Lilly sounds better to me. It all really depends on where you live. The name may not be as commonly used in your area. I know that where I live, everyone seems to be using it at the moment. Personally I prefer Eva which also goes well with Lilly. Just a suggestion!<br>  <br>  Coco sounds cute for a young child but I couldn't really imagine an adult called Coco. Plus it has negative childish connotations like Coco the Clown. It may be unique but I think you should consider when your daughter is 20. Will Coco still be beautifully unique? Or what about when she is 60? I don't think so...but whatever floats your boat!<br>  <br>  Audrey is not a name I am a huge fan off. Although it does remind me of Audrey Hepburn, the famous actress which is good.<br>  <br>  Stella reminds me of Stella Artois the alcohol.<br>  <br>  Mia is simple and pretty. Great nickname for Amelia also.<br>  <br>  Ruby is ok, I'm not a huge fan of it though.<br>  <br>  Scarlet is pretty. I prefer it with two t's though. It is gaining popularity though.|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	Ava was my favourite, too! Until it got crazy popular, that is. (I used to love Sophia too)<br>  <br>  I would pick Audrey- one of my planned baby names is Audrey Magdalena.|`|nOzQUsToaa	Coco Ava =)|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Audrey!|`|T0OUgs1kaa	Don't name her Coco. It may sound unique to you but she will be made fun of throughout her school life, and perhaps later as well.<br>  Stella and Scarlet are very feminine. I like them both!<br>  Audrey sounds a bit old. Mia is quite modern I think.|`|iCR1Rmm5aa	I like Audrey Laurel, Ava Laurel, Stella Audrey, and I have some ideas of my own...<br>  <br>  <br>  Evelynne Joy<br>  <br>  Emmalina Rose<br>  <br>  Elianna Camille<br>  <br>  Sophia Isabella<br>  <br>  Isabella Skye|`|DRGgSqGvaa	I like Ava, Audrey (Especially because it's my sister's name and sounds cute as a baby name and when they reach adulthood too), Stella, and Mia<br>  favorite: Audrey or Ava.|`|6OplSEQkaa	my name is Mia!!!<br>  Coco is my ex boyfriend's name...<br>  Stella is beautiful!!<br>  I like Scarlett!!<br>  And I like Ava Lily!<br>  <br>  I don't like Ruby, or Ava Laurel.|`|hypmxRlJaa	Stella is my favorite! It's unique yet not weird and it's gorgeous, more pretty than the other names you listed. I'd go with that.|`|N4U2oKwEaa	All pretty names!<br>  Coco, Ruby, and Laurel are my favorites!|`|gzQIstDFaa	ava lilly<br>  i also like mia|`|IOU6zo9Raa	I like Audrey the best. Scarlet is really pretty too.|`|jlSzYpZSaa	Ava Lilly is cute. My kids don't know anyone at their school named Ava. I don't think its that common as people are telling you. Not to mention, your child is much younger than the children that are in school right now. By the time your daughter is in school, there may not be as many as there are now if that's the case. I wouldn't worry about it. Name your daughter Ava if that's what you like best.<br>  <br>  As for you list of other names, Coco is my least favorite. It reminds me a  Stripper's name. The rest are all cute. My fave out of the rest would be Mia. Congrats and good luck!!|`|6t191pnJaa	i love the name ava laurel and stella! its so unique!?<br>  and i think you should also try the name brooke. i just adore that name and if you were to go with brooke, you should try the middle name to be emerald. so the name would be brooke emerald. <br>  so unique!!! :)|`|S3uCBF86aa	I am not a huge fan of the name Ava. If you were to pick it though i like the combination Ava Lilly. My favorite name on your list is Audrey. I dont like the name Coco at all, it reminds me too much of a dog :)|`|abg9qu9Saa	i only know one ava. but i like coco, thats really unique.<br>  my favorite name is roxanne, or roxie, which is also unique.|`|QUSW131Taa	just not mia- idk i just dont like it.<br>  but i love the other names. they are sooo adorable. congrats on the baby 2 :)|`|GuDApebCaa	i luv da name ava then coco then mia then ruby then audrey then stella then scarlet|`|eb347820e1d67cb921561a306b21e964aa	I like Ava, Ruby, and Scarlett, but it's true I've heard of a lot of Ava's lately, sorry to say.|`|hhb4GTrraa	I absolutely love the name Ava Laurel.

Every brown poodle known to mankind was/is called Coco.  Sorry, but it's true.  Ava is incredibly popular.  Out of your list, I'd go with Ruby or Stella.|`|RMrpXSa7aa	Ava Lilly is good<br>  also christina<br>  monicca
C5uY7lIWaa	Sometimes cycles just get thrown off.  I know that's probably not what you want to hear being that you are TTC.  Both my cousin and I thought we were pregnant in February but our cycles were 11 days late.  Very frustrating!  Hopefully you get an answer one way or another because the not knowing part is horrible!|`|4YfehneDaa	It sounds like you ovulated late in your cycle.  i think you still have a chance some people dont test positive on a HPT for awhile. you should wait a couple days and test again, but you might have to just wait until you get a blood test, that will tell you for sure.  Good luck, hopefully you'll get a BFP!
6LxXR61Waa	You could have had a chemical pregnancy and not be pregnant now, although you would usually have a period then.<br>  <br>  Maybe the first test you took was more sensitive or the Hcg(?) was more concentrated in that test.<br>  <br>  There is definitely still a chance you are pregnant.  Don't give up and just keep testing every 2-3 days (or wait longer if you can) until you get a positive test or unti your period comes or until you can get a blood test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yp9rEMSraa	That is really confusing....I dont know what to tell you...I would normally say that if you got a faint positive that it is a positive but you getting negatives past then i would say no you are not prego...Are you using the same kind of tests?  Did you try a first response or clear blue easy test?  Keep your hopes up AF is not here yet....Best of luck this month and LOTS AND LOTS OF BABY DUST|`|bf8lx9gxaa	I am almost 100% sure that you're pregnant. Even if the positive tests were faint, that still means positive. And plus you're period is 6 days late. Yeah, You're most definately pregnant. Women get a lot of negatives, sometimes pregnancy tests can't detect pregnancy at times. But there are very rarely fake positives. But if you're period is that many days late and you got two positives. You're pregnant. Just try to get in for that blood test as soon as possible. Anyways, I wish the very best of luck to you sweetie. Let me know how it goes.?
AA12112190	It is indeed possible  I would test around early next week I am very happy for you Goood Luck and God Bless !!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	If you went to the doctor,did they not ask if you wanted blood work done? That would have been a simple way to find out..<br>  <br>  _edit_<br>  Ok,too early,then wait a week. If the doctor can't give you anything conclusive yet,you're just gonna have to wait it out.|`|S5n5Za78aa	may be you can test a week from now|`|EFN07cfxaa	you might very well be!!  might want to talk to the daddy|`|YRRXtVXeaa	PREGNANT!! GOOD LUCK WITH NEW CHILD!|`|LbzQtQb9aa	if you used unprotected sex then maybe....take a pregnancy test.......|`|0HcSfdBSaa	you are pregnant but just do the test after a week.am happy for you!
a1ce753b891e4736d6398fac1fee58a5aa	Those gender tests have been around for awhile. It used to be a little cup you peed in and if the water turned blue for boy; pink for girl.  But I didn't want to spend $39.99 on it.<br>  <br>  I'd waste 24.99 on this new one for sure! But I believe there is a lab fee required as well.<br>  <br>  Well in china you are allowed ONE child.  And a girl does not carry on the family name.  A boy child is what Chinese strive for.  Most female babies are sold into slavery or left at orphan homes.|`|xxTyjZCkaa	Unfortunately there are stupid people out there who would do just that, abort the baby if it's not what they want. I do think it's an amazing thing though. I personally would love to use it when I get pregnant just so I could shop for my baby boy or girl, earlier! <3
1eda3d9bfa2960f8a35f1155f4cf0e02aa	my doctor says is normal dont worry i use a sock fill with uncooked warm rice over my belly it help me so much it feels really good!
vue9NOhYaa	It's technically colostrum, not milk.<br>  <br>  And yes, it's completely normal to be leaking a bit at 6 months. It would also be completely normal to NOT be leaking.<br>  <br>  Just wash your nipples gently with warm water (no soap) in the shower, and use breastpads if you have enough leakage to be troublesome.|`|SRzswqTeaa	It's not milk, but colostrum.  Yes, it is normal to start producing that this early (some women may start seeing it even earlier!).   You might have to start wearing a bra all the time along with a nursing pad if it gets bad enough.  This Colostrum is also called 'liquid gold', and it is high in nutrients and antibodies that your baby will need right after birth.  You will produce this until your milk comes in - which will be about 3 days after birth.  (Give or take a day or two. as we are all different).  So yeah, your body is doing everything just fine :-)|`|QM6wiVtVaa	It's very normal, but it's not milk it's colostrum.<br>  I started leaking around 19 weeks, and know of others who started around then as well.<br>  You're milk won't come in until about 3-4 days after the baby is born (usually).|`|wkd5CMNaaa	It's not milk, its colostrum. And while most women don't have this happen until later in pregnancy, it's perfectly normal|`|W03Uc369aa	yes that's normal its called colostrum actual milk wont come in till you deliver your baby.
AA10285288	LOL at New Baby Brother/Sister's answer. Have you been watching Hannah Montana, Slappy? That's a vision right there. Slappy and his wives in front of the T.V. watching Hannah Montana. <br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question. Yes. Good name. I like Jili's suggestion, too.

AA11210211	I love Walmarts clothes,but growing up that is really the only place we ever shopped.They have become more fashionable over the years though.Right now our walmart has these cute little summer dresses that I LOVE and they are only $10 too.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	The other day I saw their new summer dresses and (if I wasn't pregnant) I would have definitely bought one! From what I've heard, they tried completely revamping their style and it flopped so they reverted back to their old ways and are sticking to them. As for children's clothes, I don't shop their a whole lot because they don't always have a good selection and Target always had better sales in my area.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I'm going to be an oddball here. I hate Walmart's selection. All the clothes they sell look like crap on me. I'm too young to wear the older clothes and to short to pull off the long shirt look. I hate layering too because I run hot and have pit stains 2seconds after layering. Nope I hate Walmart and their crap selection.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I just bought a dress there.<br>  <br>  They seem to go through cycles.  Sometimes they have nice pants, sometimes all they have a poly pants with high elastic waists!<br>  <br>  Though the Walmarts near me now sell full saris.  But they are $100 but with all the sequins and the fact is 4 pieces at least I presume its a good deal, I see lots of people buying them.|`|vJEatJFPaa	yes.<br>  <br>  so have targets clothes as well as meijers...if you find something that looks nice, who cares where its from!|`|8WRnqs08aa	I use to shop for clothing at wal-mart, but I've been able to find better quality clothing at about the same price (if you look for the sales) at Gottschalks & JC Penny. JC Penny also has really nice maternity clothing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Grateful Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (Babies #5&6)|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i buy a lot of baby/kids clothes at walmart but i still dont buy much of my clothes there. i agree with the person who said the material and sewing are still crap and that once you wash them a few times, they dont look/fit so great anymore. i love shopping at ross instead. even charlotte russe in the mall has sales every week. thursdays are the best days to go cuz they have 7 and 12 dollar racks. and not just like 1 or 2, they have several. it takes a while to look through it all but you can get some great stuff.|`|955YoHvVaa	I noticed that they carry the mall style clothing now too..I mean they sell mudd pants and shirts and some of them are cute which can be found in mall stores..<br>  I might add that I don't buy anything there for myself because as soon as I get it home and wash it it doesn't fit right, and looks very unflattering..but they have some cute baby clothing..I get alot of my daughters clothing there.|`|28QPS6V9aa	I agree, it's getting more attractive....until you put it on. They still fit like crap! They really need to learn how to sew properly. Not only do they fit awkward but the material and everything is cheap so it looks like crap once you wash it. Don't be fooled, walmart clothes are still crap!|`|wol6ECnQaa	I do find some of them cute, but the limited and easily common designs made me turn away and lean more onto online shopping. It has way more provisions and variety, and most of them are inexpensive if you're patient enough to look for the right place.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I love shopping at walmart for clothes, they are afforadable and cute. But the quality of them is not so good so I can't expect them to last too long. Shrinking I mean.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	They do have some very cute clothes now my only problem with them is I find that the shirts shrink upward up not width wise ... very strange:)|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Some are, yes. But I can't wear any of their pants (never have been able to) because they are all too short.|`|AA12371168	it has gotten a lot better. even with maternity tops. they used to be so ugly and cheaply made..
FLEXqVoiaa	I am a vegetarian also, and I had a hard time explaining it the first time my son asked. My husband said something about bacon being from a pig, and my son looked really confused. I just told him "yes, bacon is from a pig" and left it at that-I didn't feel the need to mention that a pig was killed for the bacon. <br>  <br>  My son is cute-The other night my husband asked him if he wanted a hamburger for dinner, and he said "yes daddy, no meat please" lol. He always hears me order food with no meat. I'm hoping he'll go veg one day!|`|MlhiDi8paa	I realized and understood where meat came from when I was around 4. It freaked me out completely and as my mother tells it I wouldn't eat it from then on, but I staid vegetarian for 9 years and then had some chicken breast, now I eat that and calamari. I think it damaged me a bit, but everyone is different, like my brother was the opposite, he wanted to eat the fish out of our tank! Maybe it would be best if you told her, but make it seem normal and natural, as she later on begins to understand maybe it would not be such a shock to her and she can decide for her self when she is old enough|`|vZMN82U8aa	ah, my wife and eldest daughter Jessica are veggies, Francesca and I are meaty's... <br>  <br>  we didnt actually make the distinction between meat and the chicken on the telly... at 18months old, theyre just words, the meanings of the words dont occur till theyre at school, and then its a bit like learning by rote. <br>  <br>  CAT. DOG. Mummy Daddy... its simple word association, the basis of learning. so dont worry overly about what youre goiing to tell her... <br>  <br>  explain on the basis of a Janet and john book, you dont want to do the alien bursting out of the chest version, electrodes and ritual slaughter...  but despite our veggie.meaty family, we all had a choice, based on personal preference, which is why fran eats meat and jess doesnt... <br>  <br>  but i will say they both ate meat until they were 5yrs old... being veggie as an adult is a personal choice, but as im sure youre aware, kids need a different diet... discuss it with your health worker.|`|IBdSIw5maa	tell her this:<br>  <br>  "well, honey, meat comes from animals.  but we need the meat so we can grow strong, so it's ok to eat some parts of the animals."|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I said simply beef comes from cows. <br>  <br>  The response I got was 'NO silly, milk comes from cows!'|`|ANHsv4ENaa	It IS really cruel. Be honest. Tell her those animals are killed because people want to eat them. I won't sugar coat it for my son when he's old enough. He will have soooo many people influencing him to eat meat and they won't see anything wrong with only giving him their side so I have no problem telling him the truth. Animals have feelings and lives just like us but because we CAN kill them people think it's right to kill them. Then they are made into steaks and burgers and chicken nuggets and eaten. If that bothers him he can choose not to eat meat. If he doesn't care then he can chomp away.|`|gx4s68s8aa	You could just talk about the farm.  That the corn that you eat comes from the corn plants.  The beef that you eat comes from the cows. Etc. That way you are not lying, but you are not making a judgement either way.  You are just stating facts.|`|thoMmZAvaa	Didn't say anything (no pre-planned discussion/explanation), just matter of factly explained that we are eating are those particular animals during the course of a normal conversation when they bring it up. As long as you aren't making her feel self conscious when she eats or aren't discussing the finer points of your political/philosophical views you'll be fine. I wasn't sure my three year old had the concept until she told me she likes eating duckies. As to how the meat gets on the plate, she doesn't need to know the details of slaughtering, just that some people eat animals for food.|`|1hciyvKdaa	At this age of course simply child like answers are the best. Even as toddlers there is no reason to shock them into anything. Think child, think sweet, let them discover this on their own, they will. Thres no need to cause any sad thoughts in childs minds ever.  Any questions that would ruin my childrens night I put off with a quick answer and a subject change. There is enogh harsh realities in life, why bring them to light asap instead of letting them experience these observations at their own pace.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Honestly,I'd leave that part out for now,don't want to freak her out. You can just say it is beef or chicken and it comes from the grocery store.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Well, if you are a vegetarian, presumably  your child isn't eating meat either, so the question isn't likely to come up any time soon. <br>  <br>  If/when it does come up, just explain it .. complete with editorial comments if you wish. "Hamburgers come from cows.  We don't eat hamburgers because we don't think it's right to kill cows for their meat." <br>  <br>  We DO eat meat, and my child never had any issues with the idea that she was eating cows or pigs or chickens or salmon. (As I like to joke "Being at the top of the food chain has its benefits.")<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ok, then just explain it simply, when she asks. "We raise animals for their meat."   She WILL be curious as to why YOU don't eat the meat you cook for her, so you will have to explain that part.
qtCVLDFxaa	Congrats !<br>  <br>  I didn't start showing much until 6-7 months. The first time a stranger actually commented about the baby was at 7 1/2 months ! Just make sure you're eating right and taking your pre-natal vitamins. 1 pound a month first trimester is not unusual. It should start to go up to about 1 pound or more a week soon. <br>  <br>  Have trust in your body if you are taking care of yourself correctly, and block your ears for all the negative comments! I got soooo fed up with in-laws and co-workers telling I wasn't eating enough, that I was hurting my baby etc. Everyone carries differently, period.<br>  <br>  PS My baby was 7 lb 8 oz at birth, absolutely normal. So there. ;)|`|eEK3m1aXaa	I didn't show until I was around 6-7 months pregnant. Just wait, your time will come and then you'll be ready to have your body back!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~_~|`|67QVKHQ3aa	i was the same way my first 2 months i lost weight and looked skinny, after about 16-17 weeks i started to gain it back and i got a lil pouch, slowly but surely YOU will notice it before anyone else will, not im 6 months and im huge! so dont worry it will come..|`|MUEsS8tYaa	I'm 27 weeks pregnant, and showing A LOT. But I only had a tiny little bump at 16 weeks. It was only noticeable when I wore tight shirts, and it didn't even look like a pregnancy bump, just looked like I had too much for lunch. Lol. Then when I hit around 20 weeks my tummy just seemed to expand overnight. I woke up one morning and went "where the hell did that come from?!" lol.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	with my first i didnt show til bout 7 months... and i was teeny the whole time, she was 9lbs 2 oz tho!!! with my second she was teeeeeeeeny (6 lbs 11oz) and i barely was showing when i had her. i looked like most people do at 4-5 months. everyones different! i longed for a big ole' belly but they're here and perfect so its ok<br>  <br>  congrats on your boy!|`|Ihfj1lRmaa	Since you are petite, you will probably not show until later on in your pregnancy. Sometimes the baby is more towards your spine, so your stomach doesn't protrude as much. Don't worry, you will get your baby bump!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I didn't start showing until i was about 7 months pregnant.|`|5ddI47w3aa	At 16 weeks, your uterus should only be lined up about halfway between your pubic bone and your belly button.  Every week up until 20 weeks, it moves one finger width upward, so at about 20 weeks, it should be even with your belly button. This should give you an idea of where it is and about how big you should be.  My OB said people usually don't start to get a baby bump until around 20 weeks with their first baby.  I'm at 13 1/2 weeks and can barely feel my uterus (I have to push inward on my tummy to feel it) about 2 finger widths above my pubic bone.  It's not popping out yet, but just growing up.  I'd say around 20 weeks, it will start filling outward and give me more of a little baby bump appearance.  Don't worry, before you know it, you'll be showing big time.|`|0rTcFCRkaa	i too didn't show much all the way through other than losing all waist and wore normal clothes throughout by adding a V of material to trousers. gave birth to my favourite person, as in over 6 pound boy, easily - and no stretch marks. enjoy unless you wanted to be one of the bare alls with curves. almost forty years later, i'm still a tall slim lightweight.|`|72rH1NvDaa	everyone is different honey. i know of someone that didn't start showing until they were 8 months.|`|hYRYO5GYaa	hey wow  we sound identicle. except im 26 weeks now....i didnt start showing til 4 weeks ago!|`|nqHSQpqZaa	I didn't ever get real big, you couldn't tell I was pregnant until I was about 25 weeks at which point people would come up to me all the time (I worked in the mall) and tell me that I need to eat, gain some weight for my baby, etc. I ate all the time. I had my son at 39 weeks and 4 days, he was 7 lbs. 10 oz. and 22 inches long, perfectly healthy. One week after having him my stomach shrank back, I have no one stretch mark on my body, and I have a 6 pack without working out. Every woman is built differently and will carry a baby differently. I had a pretty big baby, when everyone would smart off to me and tell me that I'm going to have a preemie and that my baby is way too small to be healthy. I remember though when I wasn't showing I wanted to so bad, then one day my belly was just way more popped out. About 22-25 weeks you should definitely be able to tell in a tight shirt.
GZn5VNlSaa	I'm 9 weeks and really want a boy.  Although more of my family wants a girl.  at the end of the day as long as they're healthy!<br>  <br>  If it's a boy we will call him Aaron Paul Rudolf Gordon<br>  If a girl Miranda Vivienne Rose Faviola|`|O2oG7kiEaa	I want a girl (first, then a boy and then whatever happens), but then again, at the end of the day I'd be happy with either. I would love my child just as much either way. I like so many names!! its too hard for me to choose|`|BtSyX2nVaa	it didnt matter to me as long as the baby is health!<br>  but i had a boy and name him logan joseph pearl<br>  if i would have had a girl i would have named her macie renee pearl|`|QM6wiVtVaa	When I found out I was pregnant, I honestly didn't care what sex the baby was. I was just happy that he was healthy. Why want one sex, you'll only get your hopes up if it's the opposite.
cAtWxJG1aa	Obviously it's hard to draw hard-and-fast lines.  People suddenly don't sprout maturity at any particular birthday.<br>  <br>  But if I were making up the rules (relax everyone; I'm not), I'd make the age 18, and before that age be focusing on getting kids some serious psychological help.  obviously i don't advocate putting a 15-year-old who just shot someone immediately back onto the streets, but i don't think they should be tried as adults, either.  There should be separate and lesser penalties for crimes committed by children.  I am a huge opponent of the "adult crime, adult time" movement.  Kids don't become adults just because they did something terrible.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Honestly, anytime a child or person (regardless of age) understands and intentionally kills another person or persons in cold blood, that makes them a murderer.  Whether the child is 5, 7, or 15, if they are fully aware of what they did and did it with the intent to kill that's enough for me.<br>  <br>  BUT sometimes you have to look at why.  Was it self defense?  Was it to stop abuse?  There are so many variables that just muck up the whole legal system.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I was watching the news the other night and a young boy (I'm almost positive he was 11) shot and killed his dad's pregnant girlfriend and her two children. I think that at that age they understand what they are doing, and I believe that they understand the full consequences to it also. I think that arounf age 8 they understand murder for what it is though I don't know if they understand the full effects. My husband and I were discussing it. I'm really not sure.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	i dont know.  does anyone?  i think that age and maturity are two different things.  i even think of 16 yrs as children, heck sometimes 21 yr olds too.  <br>  i can not agree that an 11 yr old should be charged as an adult. i can't, no amount of data, polls, studies whatever will ever allow me to think that way.  i don't know when i stop feeling that way.<br>  i think the issue comes down to a broken system.  not just judicially speaking but in general.  why would an 11 yr old kill someone?  why would a 6 yr old do it?  there has to be something deeper going on.  has to be.  why was that missed?  what was missed?  were any of these kids in the juvenile system before?  what happened?  something terrible is broken.  someone a heck of a lot smarter than me should start trying to fix it.  maybe use some tax dollars toward that instead of _______ fill in the blank.  i have more than a couple that i could add to the list.  why isn't that a priority?  where are the parents?  see - too many questions and no answers.....|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I think it also depends what side of the issue you are on. For me, Derick ended a girls life the same way an adult would. This 11 year old killed a pregnant woman. To me just because he might claim he didn't know it was wrong or what he was doing doesn't change the fact that he killed people. He killed an innocent little baby just waiting to be born. The fact that he might be an innocent little child himself doesn't change the fact people are dead.<br>  <br>  I'm all for protecting kids, but I think we need to protect the victims and future victims as well. If it was your girlfriend and your unborn baby who died, wouldn't you want justice and not 7 year in juvie and some hugs?|`|prqrQcd1aa	You know i've asked that same question.. If I am able to see this and this Kenzie and I use to hang out...then why can't others see this.<br>  This kid was telling people that he was wanted to harm her and her children for some time now... but they thought that it was just a jealous stage he was going through.. they didn't think it warrented any kind of help at the time, because they just weren't thinking he was capeable of doing something like this.<br>  <br>  I think the magic age should be 18, because then you are an adult. I think the laws in our state should also be changed honestly. We don't even have a system where a person can go from a juvie facility until the age of 21 and then go into prision... what the hell? I think if we are going to try kids as adults then we should sentence them to mental facilities because kids just don't kill in instances like this because it's the thing to do..Now, in cases where a 14 year old child shoots another gang member...do we feel the same way about that child as well? That child may just be doing it to not get shot himself, or because of "gang" issues... does that kid deserve to go to jail, or does he deserve to go also to a mental institution? Can people like that be "re programed"? I don't know...there are several shades of grey with the whole ordeal honestly!|`|6VbNJOtfaa	These days, I would not be surprised if my 12 month old was tried for capitol murder.  I think it should depend on the child.  So much of the violence is by children whose parents are pieces of crap and they never even had a chance.  It is so unfair for them that they got the ***tty end of the deal.  But at the same time, you cannot bring back a life and murder should 100% NEVER go unpunished.  It is such a tough call; so tragic for both parties involved.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	I believe with Derick Owens it was accidental, and the parents were charged, the mother I believe because she was the one watching him and he took the gun out of a cabinet.  He didn't sneak up to her and premeditatively (if that's a word) shoot her.  Even her father said it was a horrible accident.<br>  <br>  With the 11yo (i'm assuming you're asking the question based on the pg stepmom murder) he knew what he was doing.  He hid it in a blanket and had made threats against his stepmum.  <br>  <br>  The difference lies in the circumstances and their mental capacity.

The "baby time" is usually said to be 8 days because in lab conditions, sperm can survive outside of the male body for 5 days. After this time is past, then conception generally can't happen. However, some women ovulate ireggularly and and release a second egg shortly after the first one.|`|klsZLzYBaa	The best time is in the morning,
DDFSITiYaa	It doesn't really matter - it is what makes sense for you and your child.  I waited with both my older ones until after 2 1/2 - they were just getting too big.  I never had a problem with them going to sleep or staying in their beds.|`|Bhy4k9wPaa	My youngest moved into his bed on his 2nd birthday because he'd started climbing out of his cot! He was 2 in January too.<br>  <br>  If she's happy in her crib, leave her for another few months then, if there's room in her bedroom, set the toddler bed up in there so she can see it and go from there. She might just naturally gravitate towards the bed by herself.|`|AA10152346	When you are sure that when you put her to bed she wont just get up and come back out. I have a 2 year old in his bedroom and still in his crib. to be able to sleep he needs to be "caged" so to speak otherwise he will inevitably get up all the time. When he's in his crib eventually he gives up and falls asleep.|`|0ky4TktEaa	No specific age. She needs to be able to stay asleep all night. If she's a relatively still sleeper, she should be fine. If she thrashes around, just make sure the bed's not way up high from the floor. If she's used to having rails to hold her in, she'll need some transition time. That's not usually an issue as far as i've seen though. Just put it in there; make a huge deal about her new big girl bed. If she freaks out about it, put it back in the attic for now and keep the crib. When she turns 3, if she's not in it yet, make it part of her birthday surprise; then get rid of the crib. 3 is most certainly too old to be in a crib with rails.|`|AA11109728	There's no 'right' time.  My daughter never tried climbing out of her crib, and she didn't get too big for it either.  So I waited, and finally put her in the toddler bed (someone also gave us one) when she was about 3 1/2.  I did that because we had to work on night time potty training, and I needed her to be able to get up and go by herself at night if she needed to.  At that age I was also comfortable with her being up by herself if she had to, she never gets into things or makes messes or anything like that, and I didn't have to worry about her going near the stairs in the hallway - she knew enough to get up and go potty then go back to bed.  Doing things that way worked out perfectly for us.  It's up to you and your daughter and your situation on when you decide to switch!|`|7aaceef242426e2a1e7394d78368ca77aa	It is different for every family. My family switches as soon as possible, usually around 12-14 months. Other families wait until two. A friend of mine waited until 2 1/2. I personally did not have a crib for my son so when someone offered us a toddler bed, that was when he moved. (he only had a pack n play, we were really bad off in a one room apt no internet and so on) My second son did have a crib but outgrew it at 12 months. He went straight into a twin bed though, not a toddler bed. My daughter uses a crib and co sleeps right now. She is only 4 months but it looks like she will be in the crib a little longer because our 2 bedroom lease ends next March. Unless we make room somehow for a bed or get a toddler bed because our crib does not convert.  <br>  <br>  Some families just co-sleep until a twin bed. These are all personal choices dependent upon how you feel about it, your situations in life (is there room for a bed?) and if she is ready. There is no right or wrong answer.|`|koVk3P9Gaa	Do it now.  I hate it when kids that are 3 and older that are still in a crib.  Mine were in a bed by 18 months.
64OsCr8laa	really no thats not normal well for me no i have a history of it but it went away i hope it dont come back<br>  <br>  140 is kinda high not to bad but still alittle when your pregnant alot of people have that problem it will totally go away after you have your baby<br>  <br>  if mine gets below 80 and above 130 i feel extremely terrible if my sugar gets in the low 70s i get so weak i feel like i could faint it got to 43 one day i passed out and another time it was 238 i was shaking so bad i could not walk!! <br>  <br>  like i said 140 is alittle high but not to bad if mine got to 140 then i would be shaky but thats really it <br>  <br>  in order to keep it down you need water as much water as you can and watch your sugar intake <br>  <br>  thats really all you have to do|`|kOXZGULzaa	I hope bt PP ,you mean 2 hours PP.Its within normal range but just normal.<br>  In pregnancy a Lady is more at risk of developing diabetes which is called 'gestational diabetes'(GDM) and it's doe to various hormones produced in body during pregnancy.<br>  You are more at risk of developing GDM if there is a family history of diabetes,maternal age more than 30,overweight,sedentary life style and ofcourse our Asian genes.<br>  I would advise you to get in touch with your gynaecologist who will most likely suggest you a test called GTT,which is confirmatory of GDM,if it shows abnormal values.<br>  Would suggest to take it seriously as uncontrolled diabetes in pregnancy could affect baby and mom both.<br>  Most likely,things can be controlled with diet control only,but sometimes medicine called metformin or insulin might be needed with a regular blood sugar monitoring at home,if incase GTT is abnormal.|`|59787f4f0e10a8b5f99f5409e4580213aa	normal on bonder line take care|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	140? As in you checked your blood sugar with a meter? If you had just eaten a meal,this wouldn't be soo bad,but if this is just a random time during the day,that is on the high side. <br>  What is your diet like?
0BC2WTyoaa	Yes that is normal.  Same with when you go in for an exam, you could have spotting afterwards.  Did you get your BFP?|`|YuA7a08Maa	I think it's very common, although it hasn't happened to me.  If it goes away and doesn't increase, then I wouldn't worry about it at all.  Supposedly your cervix is very sensitive because it becomes engorged with blood when you are newly pregnant.  Congrats and good luck!|`|ed052b6f800dc43932558f491194a7b8aa	yes i had spotting after until about 20wks  x x x
0BC2WTyoaa	That's a tough one, personally I would not bring it up because it does seem rude to me.  If I hadn't heard anything by now I would just plan on not having one that way you can start preparing.  When people ask when your shower is say that you're not sure you are having one.  Someone is certain to step in and then you can say that your mom mentioned it a while ago but hadn't said anything recently so maybe they can work together?|`|mPhsJ6Fjaa	just mention it to your mom. say something like i saw some cute baby things the other day that i love or saw some cute shower invitations. she might just be making it a surprise shower like my mom did for me.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	Just ask her how the shower plans are coming along. and when she wants you to get your guest list started.  that should get the ball rolling.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Why don't you just call your mom and say hey I'm starting to get this list for my shower going anyone you want to invite then let it go from there. Or call up your Aunt and see if she wants to help your mom with this one or call mom and see if she will call sis and get the ball moving, worst comes to worst throw your self a shower.<br>  <br>  Who wouldn't want a shower it's fun getting gifts people love babies and always ready for a baby shower.|`|pp9RzHvDaa	It's not too early at all!  You have to get a guest list, invitations, games, everything.  I would bring it up to your mom casually.  Just say something like "What kind of theme do you think would be cute for the shower?"  If she doesn't get the small hints then just ask her if she can still throw you one.  You definitely need a baby shower.  Maybe your aunt and mom could collaborate and throw one together.  If you approach your aunt and tell her, maybe she will talk to your mom and keep her on the right track.|`|rC6gL7KOaa	Since you're close to your aunt, just tell your aunt to call your mom and say "Hi sis, I just talked to your daughter and she told me you were having her a shower. I just wanted to let you know that if you needed me for anything, I'll be glad to help". That way your mom will be reminded of her promise to you and you won't be the one bringing it up.|`|qicxk5GMaa	I don't really have an answer for you I just wanted to let you know I'm kind of in the same situation.  my mom is planning a shower for me (with my fiance's mom) but my step mom raised me from the time I was 4 until I moved out when I was 18.  She mentioned a few months back about "having to throw a shower" but I'm almost 29 weeks and haven't heard anything else about it.  I don't see her that much since we all have such busy scheduled but I talked to her about 2 weeks ago and she mad me soooo mad!  She asked me if I knew what I was having... um... yeah, since before Xmas and my whole family was told... including her.  She responded "oh, well I haven't been thinking about it."  That really hurt.  I'm to the point where I don't really care if she has a shower for me or not and personally would rather not have anything to do with it.  Sorry to complain at you but just wanted to let ya know I know how you feel.  I don't feel comfortable asking her if she's planning anything... it would just be ackward like I'm expecting it.  hope everything works out for you.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	If someone throws one, that would be nice, but showers are not obligatory.
Ka52nbhNaa	Our daughter is 6 months old and has a heart defect called aortic stenosis as well as a heart murmur.  She was diagnosed at 20 weeks, in utero - so we had time to prepare.  She will eventually need open heart surgery to repair or replace the valve . . . but they want to wait as long as possible.  She is doing well, putting on weight, keeping up with her brother (she is a twin), thriving, no blue lips, happy etc . . . We were told to watch out for breathing issues and changes in appetite / weight loss.<br>  <br>  From personal experience - loads of EKGs, echo-cardiograms and other tests . . . unless your little one was sedated, it is hard to get an accurate reading so it is very likely that the results were off.  It is impossible to tell a baby to stay still so we can measure your heart!<br>  <br>  I recommend finding the best doctors in your area who work in the field of pediatric cardiology, ask lots of questions and take it day by day.  Many people like just fine with various heart murmurs etc . . . (my mom is 60 and has a heart murmur from birth, never corrected).<br>  <br>  As a parent, there is always something to worry about - some of us have things that are more serious than others . . . you get through it - what choice do you have?  Just take it moment by moment, lean on people from support and don't be afraid to ask for help - there are loads of support groups out there should you need them!<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|AORcLwTNaa	go to your doctor|`|Xc02z608aa	I actually just went through this myself, with my 9 month old son.<br>  <br>  He had a heart murmer since birth.  He had his ECG on Feb 4th.  It was just as the doctor suspected.  He has no heart defects.  His heart murmer is caused by turbulent blood flow.  So, no worries there.<br>  <br>  My grandmother is 70 something and she's lived all her life with a heart murmer.  They are really, most times, not a big deal.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mPhsJ6Fjaa	my son was born with a heart murmur. they sent us to the children's hospital to see a pediatric cardiologist. they ran all the test and explained to us how the heart worked and everything. Everything came back fine. Just give it time.|`|EmjEwfQRaa	To tell you to not worry would be redundant..because of course you are going to worry about your baby. Anything to do with your childs heart "possibly" not being normal is a terribly scary thing. But really the less you worry the better things will be for your little one. My son was diagnosed with a heart murmer at the age of six weeks, and we went to the pediatric cardi who did an echo and an ecg, the results were abnormal..he had a kinked left ventricle (like a water hose when it is kinked) and a small hole (every baby is born with a tiny hole..it is supposed to close soon after birth..but sometimes they do not) I was a terrible nervous wreck...to the point where I did not treat my baby like a normal healthy child. The cardi told me not to worry that most small problems like this clear up before age three, and My son is now a perfectly healthy murmur free 7 year old boy =)  Those times of worry are just a fading memory. So enjoy your little girl, if the doc said everything looks well, then I am sure it is something small and nothing to worry much about. Good luck from a mom of five =)|`|a7DwqEb2aa	I'm sorry to hear that your having such a stressful time with your fairly new bundle of joy :-( When i had my son they checked his heart, brain for problems due to him having breathing problems so i understand the worry your feeling. At the moment no one seems to be giving you much information i think it would be a good idea to book in to see them and let them know how concerned you are and that you would like them to elaborate as they are the only ones that will be able to put your mind at rest and let you know exactly whats going on|`|4SDqRs6Laa	My friend had that too when she was a baby. She's now 26 years old and still has it. This girl is extremely adventurous (loves extreme sports and is a flight attendant). I don't know what the details are on your little one and I'm not a doctor, but I'm sure if there was something wrong your doctor would tell you. If you're really concerned ask for a second opinion.
M1gL4Jd6aa	Ekkk, natural birth control doesn't work very well.  Why do you think there are so many children in Catholic families.  I would suggest using condoms or other forms of contraception as cycles can vary so much that one month you might have sex on a non-fertile day and the next month it might change and wham, you're pregnant.  Please be careful.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Natural birth control can go hand in hand with natural child birth.|`|pJaFd14Raa	Yoga (Spiritualism) through determination paying attention to sports/culture etc.|`|ptMhmKjnaa	just suggest you husband  not to ejecuate in vagina during sex

Ok, well First Response pregnancy tests work super well, up to 5 days before your expected period. So it wouldn't hurt to try that, as 5 days would be March 2nd. <br>  Anyhow, if you aren't pregnant and don't want to get pregnant in the next couple years, I'd seriously consider getting a IUD inserted by a doc in addition to using a condom so you have double protection. IUD's are inter-uterine type devices that apparently prevent any egg implantation. They can be removed and you can have children after still.|`|AA11548630	to get an accurate result wait until you get a missed period or just light bleeding which could be implantation bleeding<br>  until then it could come positive esp if you miscalculated your ovulation date but if it's negative you may still be pregnant|`|LS2mF8u3aa	Take it before you get preggers.<br>  <br>  You'll like the way it looks, I guarantee it.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Right now , it's recommended

IWzYB44raa	I am so glad you asked this question!!!  I thought it was only me!<br>  <br>  Sometimes I am seriously worried about myself.  I used to have the perfect memory.  If someone couldn't remember something, they knew to ask me.  Now, I am always asking everybody else.  I have lost things around the house constantly.  I have forgotten appointments and even things we have done.  Maybe it is lack of sleep?  I know I get about half the sleep I used to get before the little ones were born.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Like Betz said, I totally forget words.  Or I'll say 4 or 5 words for something before I get it right!

1yC1tyeAaa	Only time will tell, Although she's still a little early since she's only 10 months!<br>  <br>  I'm Asian / African-American with brown eyes, dark brown hair and about the same skin tone as your daughter, My husband is European (From England) with blonde hair and blue eyes. Our daughter, Violet was born with really light blue eyes, my hair color and a mix of both our skin tones, and they went to a darker blue color, with my color brown around the pupils when she was around 3 months. Violet's hair is a little bit darker (She's still blonde though!) Her skin is still the same. (Violet is 7 now!)|`|EeGgovyCaa	Not sure about eyes, but hair color can change up till they are 5 or maybe older.|`|955YoHvVaa	My neice's features never changed til she was about 3  her blue eyes turned brown and her black hair went blonde..|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I think it's a little early to tell if her eyes and hair will stay this way. Her skin probably will though.<br>  <br>  When I was a child I had very dark hair, but is has lightened up naturally- around the time I was seven.<br>  <br>  I have seen pictures of my husband when he was in first and second grade...he had very light blond hair. Today, he has the richest dark-coffee colored hair I have ever seen! I can't even believe that the pictures are of the same person as a little boy- but I can see my husband in the other features, and his mother assures me they are him.|`|JOuomnisaa	I think her hair will probably darken and her eyes may undergo a change.  Her skin will probably stay the same as long as you keep sunscreen one her.<br>  <br>  This is based on my experience with my own two kids.  My husband and his family were all blondish, while I have medium brown hair.  My two towheads now have much darker hair.|`|qej62zhDaa	Hard to say for sure but there is a good chance.|`|OPeCN20Naa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  I would imagine skin colour would stay much the same.<br>  <br>  Eye colour can go a little darker but it's the first few months of a baby's life where they undergo the most significant change of colour, if at all.<br>  <br>  As for hair I had white curly hair until I was 3yrs old but after 3 it gradually became darker and is now still curly, but dark brown.<br>  <br>  Only time will tell....
claUGpVRaa	I am 2 days overdue today and my baby is still kicking like mad! My baby's head has been engaged for almost 3 weeks too, so who knows! My midwife said lots of babies move around a lot right up to birth, so it doesn't definitely mean your baby is nowhere near ready!<br>  Mine has been more active this last week although it has been active throughout!|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	No not at all luv, with my first he went a bit hyper a few days before I had him. He kicked right up til my contactions started. Won't be long now... the last few weeks are a nightmare, I remember the feeling lol x|`|4SRrWBVZaa	my daughter moved round alot even in the last week this is the point where you feel you had enough lol know i did but my girl came on her due date so i wouldn't worry good luck x|`|9P26sacKaa	It could be that her hands are below her head or just that her head is putting a lot of pressure on your bladder.  Babies don't always reduce their activity late in pregnancy, but some do and women might worry about it, which is why they tell women that this is normal.  There's no reason to think that she's not coming soon just because she's moving around a lot.  After all, second-time moms often have babies that stay higher and move around until labor starts, unlike first-time moms who often have their babies engage earlier.  However, she might have dropped into your pelvis since your last midwife appointment, which would explain the extra pressure on your bladder and the feeling like you need to pee but nothing's there.  <br>  <br>  If your back ache goes along with your braxton hicks, they might not be braxton hicks but early labor contractions.  If they're regular and don't stop with changes in activity, they are probably labor contractions, even if they don't feel intense yet.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry, even Braxton Hicks are doing something to help your body get ready for labor, and a lot of moms who have had babies before don't get early signs that labor is coming until the day of or a day or two before it starts.  It's often a little different than the earlier babies.  Every baby is different and every labor is different for the same woman.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
V8JoRHnnaa	The digital one is easy to read, it shows changes in temp for upto about 1/ 100th  so its like more precise. ofcourse the normal mercury thermometer will tell the temp too but its difficult to read it accurately because the changes in temp r minor and not significant. plus when u have to check it like in the morning when u r half asleep its more easy to read digital one.<br>  Baby Dust :)|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Just make sure you use the same one every time. That way, even if it's not exactly accurate, it will still show you when you're up or down a little, which is what you really need to know.
TEVsayiMaa	Follow your DREAM and do what goals you have set for yourself..  Family support is really important so make sure you keep the lines open.  I was the same age when I fell pregnant and I also had a limited income but was lucky to have a supportive partner and mum and dad who I lived with until my daughter was 6 months.  Keep positive it might not happen in the order you want or as quick as you want but please follow through with your plans.<br>  Goodluck|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I feel the same way about never having enough money. But i'm not pregnant or have any children. But you will make it work. Remember u can buy alot of things second hand, do without baby stuff that isn't essential.

That is rather hectic.  You are at least thinking of how you guys will manage.  Your plan appears good, so long as your bf is prepared to stick by you.  Lots of guys get scared and run leaving the mom with the problem.  <br>  <br>  Why if you wanted babies after you had finished college, were you having sex now????|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I haven't been through it but i applaud you for having a plan to get ahead in life and not letting this stop you. your baby could technically stay in your room longer than that if needed. This may be totally out of the question but maybe moving to a cheaper state is an option. I live in washington and a 2 bedroom apt can start at 600 bucks here. If your parents are willing to help with baby sitting as such it wont work though. Maybe you can get some assistance for housing from he government. Good luck you will make it|`|decWPAHkaa	I haven't been through what you're going through so the only thing I would advice you do is to prepare yourself for anything and what I mean by anything, is be prepared to support your baby as a single independent woman. Although it sounds like you have a great support system through family and boyfriend, family may not be there for you all the time and seeing that you're so young and your bf only brings in $2,000  there is a chance he may not always be there for you. My comments aren't to discourage there to encourage you to be the best you. With that being said, YES it can work, it WILL work if  you believe in yourself and believe in your dreams. Anything is attainable if you have faith. I wish you the best of luck|`|AA12192295	We live in a one bed room in California. You can make it work in a one bedroom apartment is you use the space wisely. Even after 6 months. It will be a bit cramped but it works. Its not the perfect living space but you can make it work. Will you have any help with the baby from any family?
8WbfmK5daa	I had a period after it was confirmed I was pregnant. Apparently it was something to do with being on the pill for so long before I conceive. I cannot remember much else they said about it now but it was something like a 'false bleed'. In rare circumstances woman can have these throughout their full pregnancies which is how you get in some instances woman who never even knew they were pregnant until 6 months into their pregnancy or until they are in labour.|`|MW1yrHbOaa	in some cases you can still have your period and be pregnant, My friends sister just had a baby a couple of weeks ago, She didn't even know she was pregnant because for the first 5 months she was having a period. I would take a test and see my doctor right away.|`|4kX61Y97aa	i had a period then they stopped when i found out i was 6 weeks pregnant that means my baby was concieved before the period i had although it was different from usual<br>  <br>  so yeah the chances of having one is there may be slim though|`|nwWBddEnaa	i haven't stopped having my periods yet and i'm 6 months (22weeks) pregnant with #2 and with my daughter i had my periods for the first 4 months, so it can happen, i wish you all the best x|`|gdnL63ngaa	Some people do, although very rare. i did have implantation bleeding.<br>  It was bright red, no clots, it didn't leave a mess on panties but only when i wiped.<br>  <br>  I remember being devastated thinking it was period, I cried all weekend long.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	i personally havent, but people can, think the chances are quite low, not sure really, why dont you take a pregnancy test?|`|fkrvPvpoaa	The chances of you having a period are very slim, you lose the lining of your womb which is your period every month dues to there being no baby in there, but when you become pregnant this lining is used to protect the baby, so this means you wouldnt have a period as the lining isnt dispersed.<br>  <br>  The only thing that would be like a period ( but not as heavy ) is when the fertilised egg imbeds iteslf into your uterus maybe causing a little blood but nothing as substantial as a period.<br>  <br>  Hope this help. ( I didnt quite no the correct terminology but i hope you can understand what i mean lol )|`|4XfjUcvDaa	yes, you can have your period while pregnant.  It is actually very common for that to occur.  Your body is so use to loosing blood about every 4 weeks that it will continue to do so.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Not many women will continue with their periods, however it does happen-but it is very rare. A lot of the time women will bleed at the time that they are due for their period, but it is excess from their last period.|`|1GFHtohCaa	I didnt have any periods through any of my 3 pregnancys but my mum had them when she was pregnant with me up until she was 7 months.Some people do and some people dont.
tLGbtmGsaa	Yes it happened to me.  The pain is terrible.  The only way I could get comfortable was to lie in a certain position which was on my side.  The last 5 weeks of pregnancy was the worst.|`|M1gL4Jd6aa	Yes this is very very common.  It is the uterus and baby pressing under the ribs.  They actually stretch out while you are pregnant and go back to their normal shape after the birth.  You just have to work through it sorry - there is not much can be done about the pain!|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	This is very normal.<br>  <br>  During your whole pregnancy your body produces a hormone that loosens all the ligaments and muscles in your body preparing you for birth. This loosening gets your pelvis ready for delivery, helps your body stretch to make room for the baby.<br>  <br>  This is also why they say to be careful when doing certain exercises as you are more at risk for injury.<br>  <br>  There isn't alot you can do about it. Rest when it hurts, try to do things that you need to get done when there is little or no pain.<br>  <br>  And congrats!|`|0MUvGlHkaa	yes i have had that and it kills i try tucking a pillow behind me whilst on side and a pillow between my legs and one in front of my belly but almost laying into it in other words pillows all around so im supported and can move little by little without feeling pulled about try it and see.
3uI0JAAwaa	Thats cute, I like to play music to my son.  I will play the guitar or put on some Mozart, it really calms him as long as it isn't loud.|`|el8yX5q3aa	Hold him..sing to him....exercise his legs and arms and give him little massages.   TALK to him...<br>  <br>  usually...at that age...what you are doing is good...but sitting down with him and giving him little back rubs...rubbing his head a little while talking soothingly to him ...rubbing his little feet and gently opening and closing his hands while you talk to him etc is enough stimulation.<br>  <br>  He is a baby....as the months go forward...it gets more fun!  :))  RIght now this is a time for bonding and establishing trust.<br>  <br>  Please don't rush him outside right now.  Babies are not immune to things and it really disturbs me when I see newborns and young babies out in stores etc.  I know you want to show him off...but babies get sick so easily ..and it is difficult for them recover from serious things.  <br>  <br>  Right now colds and flu are out there...don't expose him to that...you never know when someone will bend over him to say ..."how cute" and pass on some germ that takes weeks to get rid of.  Why put him through that?<br>  <br>  A couple months at home gives him MUCH better constitution to fight things.  He really needs protection.|`|4oEuCkjPaa	get one of those child backpacks and go on a walk.|`|O8RuSBAjaa	It sounds like you are doing just fine. Keep in mind that the world is new to your son and everything is interesting to him. The simplest things will keep him entertained. Keep talking and singing and dancing with him. He's bound to love just looking into your eyes or gripping on your fingers. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your new baby. :)|`|lISrOzyraa	aww how cute-a baby, congratulations. here a link i looked up for you and read through it, I hope it helps you out. You're doing a great job already anyway, there's nothing wrong with dancing around lol I think its cute<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fisher-price.com/us/ms2/baby-games.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fisher-price.com/us/ms2/baby-...</a>|`|nqHSQpqZaa	Awww that is so sweet that you dance around with him in the morning. I remember doing that to help my son go to sleep at night. He is 12 weeks old. I was also looking for ways to interact with him at that age, I found that the best thing and the thing he liked the most was when I would lay him down and just talk to him, he would look at a toy but his attention span wasn't all there yet. Your son will get more and more fun as time goes by. Some things you can do are put him in the bath, some babies love baths... my son does. They need 15 minutes at least of "tummy time" a day, put him on a colorful blanket or something so it gives him something to look at. It will help his neck muscles also and he'll hold his head up sooner. Babies love the contrast of black and white, any different brightly colored toys are good. My suggestion for a toy is the Manhattan baby whooz it and the Lamaze Octotunes. The octopus toy is the first toy my baby actually grabbed at/touched when he was 8 weeks old. And the whooz it toy is my best friends 10 week olds favorite toy he cracks up at it. Well good luck momma <3 Your question was too sweet. (:
1WlTGkMSaa	it's very possible, but very unlikely.  After about 300 times of doing that I finally got one to take.  So my odds were 1 in 300|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	its possible but not highly likely. You're probably fine.
S5n5Za78aa	well yeah idk|`|I3V7hE32aa	I looked at several charts and all seem to appear as they should.  All had temps below the coverline prior to O and temps above the coverline post O.<br>  <br>  Of course no two people are the same and we're going to have differences in the way our temps are, but from what I saw, all seemed to have the same basic pattern.
vP1YhRaWaa	Very pretty..just remember a few things when picking a name Can you yell it easily across the playground.Can others pock fun and is it a good grown up name.|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Very pretty , Love the name .!|`|ocSGMvb6aa	Thats very nice I like it.|`|5sdLN7vLaa	Beautiful. It has a rhythm to it, too.|`|G5Wsaa63aa	It's fine but super common.|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	very cute =D|`|p65mPSozaa	Nice.  But kind of common these days.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I like the name.|`|RHjz2QUgaa	I love the name but I prefer the classic spelling of Audrey.|`|RN9uTQ2baa	that is a very beautiful name. I think audree is just such a cute name|`|Q8wDjvZ1aa	i think it sounds beautiful! i have never seen audree spelt like that.  it's different and that can be good, although i'm a fan of it spelt audrey too. either or.  you picked a beautiful name!|`|HsL0PYNGaa	its adorable!<br>  It has such a good flow, and I love the way you spelt Audree. I also love Lynn as a middle name. :) x|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Without the middle name in there, Audree Eustler sounds, idk, run-together. I've never been a huge fan of the name Audree/Audrey to begin with though. Just my opinion, though.<br>  <br>  If you like it, do it! I DO like the way you spelled it better than the traditional spelling though:)|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I am not keen on Audree.  Thats just me I suppose.  No short form and it seems like a name that does not roll off the tongue well.  Takes me an effort just to say it, anyone feel the same or am I just weird?|`|bw00QLP7aa	I have a friend who just had a baby girl in December and named her Aubree Lynn. I like Aubree better than Audree. If you choose Audree, I prefer it spelled like Audrey.|`|DWLfKACYaa	i really don't like it
8LBl7HgAaa	Hey hun, you could be pregnant! My first symptom was lower back pain, and it still hurts! lol. You may be preggo. Just wait one more week and test again. Or you can call your doc and ask her to order you a blood hcg pregnancy test and you will know right away, no need to wait for it to show up in the urine. Baby dust! good luck sweetie!|`|WJruRyYBaa	hey..i tried to add u on yahoo messenger,,bt u blocked it. :(<br>  im actaully in a very very bad mental condition..thinkin abt wats goin on wit my GF..pls add me up..or atleat gimmi ur email..|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i got a negative test 3 times. then i went to the doctors and got a negative blood test too! so i went home and i was just waiting for my period. then after i still didn't get my period.. at this point i was 25 days late. i took another home test at like 11 at night and it was positive in like one Second! so then i ran to CVS and bought 3 more test and they were all positive. the next day i went right to the doctors and they didn't do a blood test they just left my tummy and did a ultra sound and i was 5 1/2 weeks!!!!!! so if you get a negative home test or a negative blood test... it can be wrong!|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	i think its too soon to test.
M1KYxcvSaa	Okay, first, take a deep breath.  There is nothing you need to do to get your daughter back.  She sounds like a very loved, happy child.  Of course she's going to cling to her grandparents when they come visit.  She doesn't see them all the time like she does you, and they give her everything she asks for.  Wouldn't you go running to them too?  And don't be too worried about her mixing up the names.  They are very similar but I am absolutely certain she knows who is who.  <br>  <br>  And as for you being the "bad guy" well, yes.  You are.  You are the one responsible for disciplining your child and I am glad to hear that your parents don't try to take over in that area.  It's your job to be her mother, not her friend.  It's the grandparents' job to try and spoil her and offer her a place of pure acceptance.  Unless something they do is interfering with your parenting, then I think you need to let it go.  My parents like to spoil my kids too but only see them a couple of times a year.  They felt like all rules were off when they came to visit and I finally had to tell them that it took me a week to get the kids back to their normal routine after my parents visits.  Once they understood how it was affecting the kids, they toned it down a bit.  <br>  <br>  If there are issues, you need to discuss them with your parents, of course.  But try not to be so accusatory, you come across (in this posting) as very angry and frustrated and I imagine you would have a hard time talking to your parents about this without getting really emotional and worked up.  So find a way to talk calmly about how they can help you with your daughter.  Approach it in a way that you are including them in a partnership and value their input rather than accusing them of "taking" your daughter.  <br>  <br>  And with your family coming over today, gush with them over how wonderful it is that your daughter is so close to her grandparents.  Don't sit there sulking and being embarrassed because there's nothing for you be embarrassed about!  Sit back and enjoy the beautiful relationship they have.  Know that your daughter feels unconditional love from several people in her life.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Instead of fighting it, enjoy it, enjoy the you time it provides you, they can do no damage ok.  Its nothing to be embarrassed about, I guess you have not seen good grandparents loving and caring for thier grandchild before. <br>  Were they the ones supporting you while you were a minor? If yes, they too were also mommy and daddy right, I mean they were in the childs life, mom will always be mom, my grandson sees me once a year, he flies into my arms as if I lived next door, I tell my daughter, not ask, where I am taking him, she tags along if she wants to, she enjoys her time alone if she doesnt. I protect my grandson from the mundane, no dont do that, ok now your in trouble, he too needs a break from a daily routine, my daughter doesnt argue at all, when I whisk him away, run clean up the messy toys, and out the door we go again for more fun and life experiences. You need to try and grow up a little, I know your still very young, and parenting is very difficult, and we work hard on routines etc, but no one would ever think ill of you when grandma walks in and takes control ok. Worry about you, worry about the house being clean, the menu, the mom things, let grandma afford you the time to do all those things. Someday, they may not be there anymore, and you will feel aweful for feeling this way, so start new and fresh, get on the band wagon and be ok with this. The door closes when they leave, and any tongue bitting, will just disappear ok, as you grow older, you will learn, part of growing up is to accept what you cant change, to pick your battles, and let others be right sometimes, truly you will be a happier person for it, you will.|`|decWPAHkaa	The first two answers said it well. The only thing I would suggest you do is to bring back the order in your home. Let your parents know that there are rules and a schedule your daughter must follow and so should they. As far as the the affection your parents and daughter show for one another. That's nothing to be jealous of. You are very very lucky young lady to have parents who are there to support you and to embrace your baby. I would be abundantly grateful if my dad was still alive to share these precious moments in my children's lives. And so should you.|`|bRLWDEgraa	A little jealously of the grandparents can be normal.  However,  you seem to be taking it to heart a little too much.  Your parents are just trying to spend time with their granddaughter,  and there's nothing wrong with that.|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	Sounds like you two are always together so when someone new shows up she like a different kind of attention.  Let them help- it is ok!  This gives you a chance to breathe!  That is very important when being a mom.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well in all honesty you sound jealous. i dont see a problem with your daughter loving her grandparents this much and vice versa. yes i know it hurts when she runs to then to kiss her grazed knee better but it happen. she sees them only every other weekend and they spoil her nothing wrong with that. there like a novelty for her when they come over. about the bed time issue id put my foot down there as this can upset routine! other than that your her favourite person in the whole world dont feel bad if she wants to cuddle up with grandma sometimes.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Young kids get like that with people they love..it do sn;t take you away as her mum..<br>  Set some boundaries ..maybe ask them not to go to her at night, explain that it makes things awkward and upsetting for you AND your daughter at other times..they sound like they think the world of her so they should listen...put it to them in a way that makes them think about their granddaughters well being NOT your jealousy..if you stamp your foot and act jealous they will treat you like a child..be an adult but also remember that she is you daughter and always  will be, no matter how mush she loves her grandparents. :)|`|f2ZNJy48aa	Well, since YOU ARE 18 YEARS OLD WITH A BABY your parents are just trying to help out. jeez|`|8OhH83NTaa	I'll try not to make light, because I KNOW how you feel. I was 19 when my daughter was born. She loved everyone BUT me it seemed! My sister, my parents, her dad. I used to get so angry and upset. Just let it be. She KNOWS you are her mommy. You can talk (calmly) to your parents and ask them not to undermine you when it comes to discipline...but just be happy you have family willing to take such a big part in your daughter's life. some aren't that fortunate.<br>  <br>  ETA: ALSO, being that you are only 18...they could be having "empty nest syndrome" and just happy to have a little one around again!|`|HCvWXdNAaa	That sounds really tough. I can understand why that would upset - it would really get to me too. I don't have children (just siblings and lots of babysitting growing up) but I think in time your daughter will lean more towards you again - its just that she doesn't see your parents all that often. I'd put money on the fact that if you were to leave your daughter with your parents for the day (to go shopping or something) then the second you'd get home she'd run to you like she hadn't seen you in years. She's probably just used to you being there every day - whereas your grandparents go away and so she knows to cling to them while they're there. <br>  If I were you, I'd try to relax (easier said than done, I know), if you're the loving caring mom you say you are then believe that your daughter loves you back just as much. In the meantime try to appreciate that you daughter and your parents are close - this is really a good thing and so sweet. I know this is awful to say, but what if something ever happened to you? (knock on wood) At least you'd always know that your parents would be there to look out for your daughter and love her like their own. I think its a wonderful thing that your family get on, and your jealousy over this matter will only spoil that. Please try to let it go. You know at the end of the day that she is your daughter, you make the decisions and you're the one she'll always count on.<br>  I hope this helps and good luck with everything.x|`|IWzYB44raa	I understand how you feel.  At the same time, your daughter loves you more than anything.  She just clings to them because she doesn't get to see them as much.  My kids do the same thing with their grandparents.  Don't be hurt by your daughter getting names mixed up, that just happens when kids are little and names sound similar.  I do that all the time to people, and I am an adult.  I know what you mean about them playing the same games and little things that you do, and you want it to be special.  I have gone through that too because I wanted some things to be special and just between us.  However, I realize that it doesn't always work like that.  My relationship with my kids is special because I am always there.  The grandparents aren't.  I don't see you as a jealous mom, just a new mom and you want to be important to your daughter.  I understand that.  The only thing that I would be bothered about is that it seems your parents make you the bad guy to do the punishing.  If they love her, then they should help you out by making her do right themselves and not just relying on you.  They shouldn't go and undo your rules about bedtime either.  They should back you up.  You asked how to get your little girl back.  She is yours!  She would chose you over anybody else, I promise you.|`|Zew5sfbyaa	i agree with you to an extent I am a firm believer that the grandparents can spoil the child with in certain limits. When they are still young they don't understand rules can be broken with mimi and not with mommy. In the end you know your parents and need to decide are they really only trying to be mimi and grandpa or are they trying to "steal" her as you put it. In the end you are the mom and they have privileges to her not rights. So you need to make sure you keep your boundaries in place and make sure they are healthy boundaries. Your parents may not like them but in the end you are the mommy good luck. This can be a sticky situation.|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	i disagree with the jealousy thing.  i understand how you feel.  they come in and disrupt you healthy and functional routine, give your child the idea that it's okay to do things that are clearly not okay with you and are being completely disrespectful of your wishes.  you are the mother now and you need to put your foot down.  it is your right and your responsibility. i would say it's no big deal the visits were only once in a while, but being that they are weekly it is too much.  you daughter is going to be confused by the rule changes.  you need to tell your parents something like "i love you and i appreciate what you have done for me but this is how we do things here.  i understand how you are feeling but i am the parent here and i have decided to do things this way.  if you can not respect that then your time with my daughter will be cut to a minimum"  why are you letting your parents visit you so often?  you are an adult now, i think you need to break away a bit so you can be more independant and show them you can do this without their interferance.
i6p9dJOSaa	Are you saying he just was in but didn't ejaculate inside you?  Or he did ejaculate but wasn't in all the way when it happened?<br>  <br>  Technically, you can get pregnant (supposedly) without penetration at all, as long as semen comes into contact with the vagina or the outer edge of it.  Any little buggers there can swim up on your vaginal secretions.  I don't want to encourage you to take risks, but the data says something like over a million sperm are ejaculated (if he ejaculates inside you) and about 50 make it to the egg.  So I figure if he is inside you but does NOT ejaculate, the likelihood of getting pregnant, though not impossible, is small.<br>  <br>  Best to use condoms and eliminate all risk, especially if you are young and unmarried.  Go find a few kids to babysit for an overnight or a weekend and this will give you incentive.|`|rUPjr7hjaa	Yep, you sure can.|`|b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	um duh! you can get pregnant if he is in you at all and even upon pull out any sperm can still make its way in. Shese don't they teach kids what sex is in schools?|`|AA10998151	Ideed you can - just a peep through he front door will do it!  The little blighters can fit though the keyhole!
185431bf2d462938a17318fe8510b2c0aa	In your notes there is a page with abbreviations onto what things mean, <br>  im not quite sure if it is in the front or back.<br>  look through them and you will see the page<br>  or you could always google the letters|`|i6p9dJOSaa	It may have been "fundus" written in short-hand or just poor handwriting.  The fundus, I believe, is the top edge of the uterus.  They feel for and measure where the top of the fundus is each visit and this tells them how big your uterus and baby are and how many weeks along you are.
HWRk31Fjaa	Yes you can, I have it and i'm still going to be able to deliver vaginally and breastfeed. All they'll do is when you get a certain amount of weeks put you on valtrex until you deliver that way you won't have an outbreak before the baby is born and spread it.|`|UNLrYNeUaa	from what I've heard if the woman has herpes she can still a normal pregnancy but when the times comes to give birth it has to be done by c-section so the baby isn't exposed to the virus and yes she can still breastfeed|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, and yes.  <br>  <br>  If you have active lesions at term, you might need a c-section.<br>  <br>  It has no effect at all on breastfeeding. (Virus isn't passed via the milk.)|`|pHAKN32yaa	I was told that if u have an STD that the baby will be born with it too. I dont know if thats true or not. Also, A c-section is greater than a vaginal birth.<br>  <br>  check out this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.herpes.com/pregnancy.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpes.com/pregnancy.shtml</a>
3qI1oyFaaa	I started waking up about every 2-3 hours on average around 24 weeks or so, but every woman is different, and every night is different. Sometimes I'm up every hour or so, sometimes I'll go 4+ hours without getting up, and anywhere in between...|`|9P26sacKaa	You shouldn't ever wake up every hour, but I suppose some women might if they're drinking water through the night.<br>  <br>  Most women don't have this except in the first trimester when baby is sitting on their bladder and very late in pregnancy when the weight of the baby and uterus is pushing down on their bladder again.  Sometimes this doesn't happen until a few days before labor or even until labor starts.<br>  <br>  However, if your urine is not light during the day, you are not getting enough water and need in increase your intake.  It could be that you're not peeing in the night or enough during the day because you're slightly dehydrated.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Every hour is a bit extreme. Sometimes i can sleep right through, other times i wake up twice in the night. It just depends on your body and if your baby is leaning on your bladder or not.|`|AA11116434	I was fine until my last 3 weeks of pregnancy, and then I'd only get up once or twice.|`|Zrdg3XJlaa	AS the baby gets bigger the more you'll have to go to bathroom, but depending on your body and how much liquid you consume, the frequency could change. <br>  <br>  Just had my Daughter in December and I was up at least 3-4 times a night, but with my son, maybe 1-2 a night. I was alot bigger with my daughter than my son.|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Umm, never.<br>  <br>  I figure it's natures way of preparing us for uninterrupted sleep once your baby is here.  That way you're not like what the h*** with all the late night ups and downs.<br>  <br>  Right now, stop drinking anything a couple hours before you go to sleep.  It helps a little I only get up once a night.|`|kvYgopThaa	I didn't start peeing a lot until my last trimester. Now im up and down 3-4 times a night (I drink a lot and keep a bottle beside my bad at night in case i get thirsty) I am 37 weeks and don't get up every hour.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Never. <br>  Every hour is pretty extreme. Some women end up waking up 1-3 times during the night, others can sleep right through all night. <br>  It also depends on how much you drink before you go to bed.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I don't think you will be going to the bathroom every hour may be few times per night.  Are  you drinking enought water?  My doctor told me that I should be drinking 32 oz of water per day.|`|c6bde8f9a87bbbe5e37ddc75d9270523aa	Throughout my whole pregnancy I never had to get up during the night to pee. Just first thing in the morning as usual.|`|K70Hkq5haa	When your baby gets larger, the weight of him/her will be pushing your bladder. This is normal.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	In a few weeks. One day I realized that I finally slept through the night. I felt great and well rested.|`|dDVAUA9saa	I didn't go to the bathroom every hour at night until the night before I went into labour.<br>  <br>  The first and last trimesters are usually worse for frequent urination.  In the first trimester, it's hormones that cause frequent urination and in the last trimster it's the weight of the baby doing aerobics on your bladder.  <br>  <br>  I usually am up once a night, but not every night.  I'm 24 weeks pregnant.
7clS7baaaa	this is normal for a lot of husbands to think.  you could be on top of him-he laying on his back(either you face towards him OR towards his feet-either way is great) , you could be kneeling on all 4s with him behind you.  you could lay on your side with him behind you....look it up on the internet and youll find lots of different ways to have sex where you are not belly to belly....good luck with your pregnancy and enjoy your little precious!! there nothing greater than becoming a mommy!|`|AA12395149	Side lying with one leg wrapped around his torso (the lower leg) and one up by his shoulder (feels pretty darn good too!) and doggy style (you can either have your legs separated or squeezed together, I get a better sensation with my legs together)  With doggy style you can also change your stance more easily, you can either make yourself like a table by resting on your hands, or make a slant by resting on your elbows, or you can do a semi wheel barrel where he holds your arms straight behind you.  I think my husband isn't getting weirded out because I work in the field and I've always talked about how safe many things are during pregnancy...well before we were even thinking about getting pregnant.  If he is weirded out by my big belly, he's really good at hiding it!|`|IOp3knBjaa	I am in the same position as you are. My husband is not really weird about having sex, but a bit timid. He is scared that we will accidently hurt the baby, as am I. We are at the point where we have experimented alot with different positions and so far the ones that have made us feel that the baby is safe is with both of us on our sides. Doggy style tends to scare me because I am scared I could accidently fall on my tummy! If nothing else experiment with what works best for you and your husband. Best of luck!|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	im 8 months & my belly hasn't got in the way yet! <br>  try him behind you or commonly known as "doggy style"<br>  you'll forget your belly is even there!|`|AA11208683	well sex while your pregnant is almost always uncomfortable for one partner or the other. im 8 months and with this big old belly i feel ugly and everything but my husband for some strange reason loves it.... but some positions that you could try are... if you are on top sit instead of laying on him, and if he doesn't like seeing the belly wear something to cover it up.... doggy style cause then he cant see it or feel it at all, but this might get a little uncomfortable for you.... other wise spooning, i find that this one actually hurts me but everyone is different.... if your on top you could try and turn so your back is to him, but then your butt will be to him.... i hope this helps a little, good luck!|`|f9lZK2aKaa	I agree with Sarah. If you are on top your belly will stay out of the way. The spooning position is great as well. You just have to be inventive, especially if this is your first pregnancy. Inventing can be interesting...trust me...God Bless!! Congrats on the new little one.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	My husband never had a problem with my stomach, it gave him an excuse for me to be on top.<br>  Try being on top, it worked well for us up until the day before I went into labor.|`|1Uf0vbhkaa	My husband doesn't get weirded out by my belly but I find myself the one uncomfortable.  I just can't seem to enjoy it or find a good position.  I have noticed if I stay on top and not lay on him it is a lot better, you belly doens't get in the way at all.  Or you can try the spooning method, that works too.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My husband was scared to death to hurt the baby when I was pregnant!! Dogy style is about the only thing that was comfortable when I got biger for us.
AA12112190	Discharge varies from woman to woman so its hard to really say what is normal I have the same problem so just about every month I get excited thinking this is it and bam af is back!!! unless there is an odor or itching you are probably ok|`|fqdIVD3Yaa	Egg White Cervical Mucus--- that is what it means...|`|nQPcbjLKaa	What's ewcm?
b54f2819c0f949504284cf7b20288c9faa	I got bladder infections when I was pregnant. My best friend figure out she was preggo with all four of her kids because of bladder infections (that was the only time she got them) deff wait and take a test on the first day of your missed period. Good luck to you!|`|DV6wYtwvaa	when i found out i was pregnant i had a bladder infection and didnt even know it! ou could still be pregnant test again after you miss af|`|X6549Cxlaa	i dont hink it can|`|xnhwmontaa	Well I am nine weeks and have a BAD UTI. I went to my doctor and they said I had traces of blood in my urine. Not from possible miscarriage but because the UTI is so bad. Good Luck to You|`|kVIOtS5gaa	you can be pregnant and have a bladder infection, yes. just get tested?
fL6jNee5aa	it's def. your boyfriends.|`|1s3nddaYaa	the guy that you broke up with.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	the father of the baby is your ex's. Two days is WAY to early to have a positive on a pregnancy test. <br>  tyff|`|ad0F70IMaa	yeah it would have to be your boyfriends. you were already pregnant when you had sex with the other guy. the doctor didn't give you a conception date? you can also go by that once you find out how far along you really are.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	It's your ex's. You don't get pregnant and get a positive line that quickly. When you conceive, it takes about 5-10 days to implant so your body doesn't produce enough hCG to be detected on a hpt within 2 days.|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i believe your boyfriends.|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	It would be impossible to get a positive HPT less than 3 days after conceiving the baby. The earliest I have ever heard of anyone getting a positive was about 8 DPO (days past ovulation). This is generally when the fertilized egg implants into the uterus and HCG is produced. HCG is what registers on a HPT to determine you are pregnant.|`|o2ehEqinaa	It's your boyfriend's.  2 1/2 days isn't long enough for sperm to fertilize an egg and your body to start making the pregnancy hormone apparent in the test.  Feel confident that it's your ex-boyfriend's baby.|`|90zcKChJaa	The dad is your ex boyfriend, not the recent guy you slept with. You cannot get a positive only after 2 days of having sex.|`|eYQEZBsPaa	A test wouldn't show you were pregnant 2 days after conception, so it's 99% not the other guy! More than likely your boyfriends.|`|i9M0U9Meaa	its your boyfriends|`|V8JoRHnnaa	the first guy|`|GxYtTjUbaa	Its your boyfriends baby hun. If u had sex 2days before with that guy you wouldn't have been able to get a positive result so soon cause you would only be three days pregnant I say your about 3-4 weeks prego cuz thts when I hpt comes out positive. No more sleepin with other guys your a mommy now congrats|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I would say most likely the boyfriend. But to be 100% sure, you would have to have a DNA test. Faint line means pregnant, so congrats!! But you really do need to start using protection. 1 in 5 sexually active americans have an STD and do not even know it, bc they have no symptoms. But they can still pass it to their partners and even their baby if they are pregnant. HPV (the virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer) for instance can be in your system for years without ever causing any symptoms at all. Pap smears do not pick up STDs unless you specifically tested for each STD and then it doesn't always. So just be careful. Casual unprotected sex is never a good idea. It isn't only you now, you have to think about the health of your baby as well. Best Wishes!!!|`|d304540c53bb1ee7a9ad670a4d0574e8aa	it is your boyfriends, no way in two days you can get prego and it show up on a test, go to wedmd and look you will see it takes anywhere 3-5 days for implantation and even then you are not producing enough hcg to show up on a preg test, good luck and don't stress too much it can hurt the baby, if you are really worried there are several places you can get a sono and confirm the age of you baby|`|8MnjjpJ7aa	oh, you may need to have a DNA test to know for sure. I think you will have to wait till the baby is born for that. Although you dont say how much time was between being with the 2 guys. Good Luck..|`|AA10998151	Yeah your ex- boyfriend - is he still going to be your ex when you tell him?<br>  <br>  I wonder will you both to make a go of it in that case?|`|weA0Xdszaa	it takes 48h for the spermatozoid to get to the egg... so you wouldn't even be pregnant if it was from that last guy.<br>  100% sure it's from your ex.|`|CFnkrvyvaa	I don't think the pregnancy hormone would be strong enough to be detected after two and a half days. I would say that it's your boyfriends. Good Luck!|`|z8YZY9lOaa	ummm idk, I would say your ex boyfriend? I know you've probably heard this a million times, but use protection unless you wanted to get pregnant.
1eda3d9bfa2960f8a35f1155f4cf0e02aa	u need to talk to ur doctor inmediatly
xHrfF86Haa	Mood swings & depression are common in pregnant women so first of all, you're not crazy, you're just pregnant!  If it is a real concern you have to go and see your doctor & ask if there is any sort of support they can offer you. Well done for trying to stop smoking, that is so important for your babies as smoking mothers increase their chances of having premature babies & everytime you have a drag on a cigarette your baby has to fight for air - much the same as your own lungs do.<br>  <br>  You are NOT going to be a horrible mother. I take it you are in the US - in England they would give you a council flat which a local council would help pay for so that you could live with your boyfriend and stay in the area you know. Could you perhaps do some research and see if there are any schemes like that available to you??<br>  <br>  As for twins... twins are hard work and that's the truth. They are also an incredible joy abd bring huge amounts of pleasure. Double trouble but also double the fun as they grow and get older. The good news is you have a few months to work out how you are going to cope with two babies so get online and do loads and loads of research. Speak to loads of other mums with twins and ask them for hints and tips on coping mechanisms. Get yourself involved in a mother & baby group and make friends with other mums & mums-to-be like yourself. Basically get people around you who can help. Don't think negatively. Buy books, do research and get yourself completely clued up on what to expect when pregnant & when having kids - the bottom line with fear & depression is that they breed in areas where you don't know much about something. The less you know the more scared you are. So get clued up.<br>  <br>  And finally, I have no idea what your viewpoint is on religion and am not here to find out, but I do know that certainly in England, a local church can be a huge support to you as there will be people there who WANT to help you so that is something to think about. Church aside, there will be groups around to help so get yourself involved in physical people-meeting groups, online forums, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck and don't even think about giving up. You're going to be an amazing mum, you're just a bit scared about it and that's natural. <br>  <br>  You'll be great!
AA12009107	My dr actually recommended taking a bath after having my 1st son. I also had stitches from an episiotomy. He did say not to stay in too long as I was still bleeding and a we all know, tampons are  a no-no after delivery. <br>  <br>  You say stitches, but are they from a c-section or from an episiotomy? Dont know if that would make a difference or not though. Just to be sure though, give your dr a call.|`|vDhHzxRJaa	I took a bath when I got home and my baby is 2 weeks but I didnt get stiches so I dont know
YuA7a08Maa	If you are confirmed pregnant, I think this is normal.  My nipples were spotty for a little while until they became all dark.  I guess pigmentation can happen at abnormal rates.  Ask your doctor the next time you go, but I wouldn't worry.  Good luck!|`|qwVtHWmIaa	<a href="http://answeringonly.allnight.nl" rel="nofollow">http://answeringonly.allnight.nl</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|61e43026c2296d0395ca66a2a1b35b79aa	Could just be the pigments in your skin changing. I would wait and see if it spreads or stays. I don't think its anything to be alarmed about considering all the changes with hormones and stuff we go through with being pregnant. I would almost bet it will go to being dark like the rest of the skin here soon. If you are still worried talk to your doc at your next check up to have them give you some piece of mind. <br>  Good luck with your pregnancy!!
7uznrLBXaa	No.  <br>  <br>  It sounds vaguely feminine, too, like Trudy. <br>  <br>  I went to a school with a guy named Trust.  How about Trust?|`|lYjweuZmaa	uh idk i wouldnt name my little boy that but go for it ... it is different and unique|`|nJs0UBDraa	a*s kicked in school|`|MSGixNibaa	To be completely honest with you, it looks like a joke. I’ve been known to have a certain soft spot for words used as names from time to time (Haven and Poet have been guilty pleasure of mine for a long time), but Truce is just cheeeeesy.<br>  <br>  It looks like you tried too hard, I’m sorry. If you want something uncommon and a little quirky, try some names from other cultures. Greek and Gaelic names have a lot of spunk. Go check those out and come back. :D (Link in sources).|`|DWLfKACYaa	terrible. I agree with the other person who says it sounds like part of the truce is to have a baby|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Um, I don't think I like it much. It's kinda like "we were fighting about the kid's name, so we just called it (a) Truce"|`|390a7b944cbf9a35d6773ba7a3632356aa	i personally don't like it. It sounds like the baby was the end result of a fight or something. Usually you call a "truce " when you don't want to fight|`|ocSGMvb6aa	I guess to me it would depend on the other name it would be paired with I'd like it for both|`|EFN07cfxaa	to be brutally honest it makes me think that part of the "truce" was to have a baby Sorry<br>        best of luck though|`|G5Wsaa63aa	It's unique but rather odd, and sounds a bit feminine like Tru.
qJaurSycaa	duh|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Wow out of all the answers I read only one had it right and it is Steph with <br>  step 1: farmer takes the chicken over<br>  step 2: farmer takes the grain over and brings the chicken back<br>  step 3: farmer takes the fox over<br>  step 4: farmer takes the chicken over|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	he needs to leave the grain with the fox and make a few trips|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The farmer hires another boat to carry him and his items across. LOL<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  He can take the chicken across, because he can leave the fox with the grain safely.<br>  <br>  He will then have to return, and take the fox over, bringing the chicken back with him.<br>  <br>  He will then leave the chicken again, and take the grain across, because as I said before he can safely leave the grain with the fox.<br>  <br>  He returns a final time for the chicken, and brings it across.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	This is a really old one.  The farmer will have to make several trips.  The way I heard it there was room for the farmer and two other items. One solution:<br>  <br>  Farmer takes chicken and corn across.  Farmer returns to the other side with corn and retrieves fox.  Then he makes the trip back to the other side. <br>  <br>  For your question:<br>  <br>  Farmer takes chicken to other side.  Goes back and gets fox.  Takes fox to other side and brings chicken back to original side.  Takes grain back and leaves it with fox.  Finally goes back and gets chicken.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Why a thumbs down for the exact same correct answer that got 3 thumbs up?  Haters!  Btw: I always respond before reviewing other answers.

H2IqzG12aa	From what I hear, she produces lubricant and her clitoris swells up.  Also, she produces more estrogen and adrenalin so that her heart beats faster and she gets "warm fuzzies" all over.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Her uterus and ovaries will become sexually mature, she will get periods, her breasts will develop, her hips, buttocks and pelvis will widen. <br>  <br>  That the general thing.|`|l1STgPyRaa	mostly if they become turned on by it the most that can be noticed by others (maybe) is there nipples will become erect or hard. they may also get something like a orgasm too and that is only going to have a little Liquid come out and pads can work to help absorb that not shore of anything alts|`|TYQOafA8aa	Are you old enough to see erotic things?|`|oHNsAcInaa	You get wet..and have urges.

dpPqH7BAaa	For everyone who thinks there isn't a 4th trimester, there actually is. Technically it's not classified as an official "trimester" because there are only supposed to be 3, each lasting around 3 months give or take a week depending on your cycle and the length of your pregnancy (every baby is different). Some babies go to 42 weeks, which is past the 40 week Due Date, and the last trimester. They call this time when you are overdue the "4th trimester" because you are still pregnant, but past all of your actual trimesters. It just doesn't last the usual 3 months, only a few weeks if you are very overdue.<br>  <br>  If you are worried about hurting the babies head during sex, don't do it so rough, but just to let you know, there is water to prevent hurting the baby. You have two classified waters, the fore waters, and the hind waters. It's all the same water, but the fore waters as it's called, is the water in between the babies head and cervix when it drops into position and starts descending into the birth canal. The reason some women are advised not to perform rough sex, is to prevent ripping or breaking the membranes to the water. However if that is what you are trying to accomplish, then it's fine. Just make sure you aren't already dilated, or that your water hasn't already broken or ruptured. Other than that you will be perfectly fine. Hope this helps.|`|iHJuXKBiaa	I completely agree with SluTina.....I was hornier when I was pregnant. Rough is how I play.<br>  <br>  Funny thing is after my son and daughter were born...they ran up to their father a few years later and started pounding his head with their fists screaming, "How do you like it Daddy!"<br>  <br>  lol, true story!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Most books and doctors advise against "rough sex" during pregnancy, because it may rupture membranes prematurely.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	TRImester ...

siDcjgJCaa	Lets see... I went to bed at 9.30pm I was up at 12.30pm (to settle a fussy baby) and again from 2am-3am (to feed my fussy baby). Then I was up at 5.30am (to get my husband and the baby out the door) and then up at 7.15 (after hitting my alarm several times) for work...  This has been going on for 8 months.. i am tired ....|`|8WRnqs08aa	Fortunately, my baby has been sleeping 5-6 hours, waking to eat & a diaper change, then sleeping another 4-5 hours.<br>  <br>  While she was breaking her first two teeth, she was up every 1-2 hours and I was just exhausted.

I can't keep anything down, and I'm completely exhausted.|`|zQWNb6neaa	5 hours and the bags under my eyes show it! Thank goodness tomorrow is Saturday, my day to sleep in while hubby takes the morning shift with the kids.

28QPS6V9aa	Why not wait until your baby is good and ready? Like most people, I was selfish and cared more about my own needs verses my babies and I did something  risky. I used castor oil. It worked! I went into labor right away, but I don't recommend it. It made my labor last forever! I know how you feel, it's uncomfortable but just be patient. Don't do what many of us dummies do and take matters into your own hands, just let your baby come when he or she is ready. Won't be too much longer now. If you're fourty weeks that means two more weeks max. You can handle it!|`|AA11208683	there is a bunch of different ways, havent tried any of them yet im to early with my first one, but walking, sex, nipple stimulation, castor oil (i would not do this one but its been done) and some teas and herbs, my mom is an RN and she says that spicy foods will do it, bumpy roads, and even like massaging the back of your ankle. but the ankle and the nipple stimulation you would have to do it a few hours every little while during the day, and the nipple stimulation will cause the contractions to be longer and harder... i hope this helps... good luck|`|uGqYoZNEaa	Lots of walking and what little sex I could enjoy!  <br>  <br>  Good luck, it'll happen, just get lots of rest, do the rest of what you can in the house, rest, enjoy quiet time with hubby/boyfriend, rest some more, make sure things are set up, and rest some more!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	wow, congratulations!!!  I am almost there and can't wait.  With my first pregnancy I walk walk and walk.  Even with my early stage of  labor I walk around the hospital in maternity department.  It really helps.|`|uij93NOjaa	Sex is the first thing I will suggest!! If your hubby/boyfriend isn't around then lots of walking!! Go to a mall with a friend and just start doing laps haha!!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Walking, birthing balls, nipple stimulation|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	sex and walking!! Good luck!|`|XulwuKi9aa	Do a lot of walking|`|pNPJH1WBaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Lots of walking to get the baby to engage and then lots of sex. Apparently there is something in sperm which softens the plug to your cervix.<br>  <br>  Also you could ask your midwife to do a sweep. I had one and it is not plesant but it brought my labour on. For info on what a sweep is go to <a href="http://www.askbaby.com/membrane-sweep.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.askbaby.com/membrane-sweep.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|X0f444TOaa	Sex, climb stairs a lot, vaccuum, exercise.  Anything physical you were told not to do.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Sex and exercise.<br>  Also when U R in labor make sure they do not force U to lay down all the time, as this actually slows down the labor. Walking and moving around are great ways to speed things up. I squatted a lot, and sat on the toilet seat when I got exhausted. That is when I realized why they made birthing stools back in the old days. Labor is better when we are in an upright position. <br>  Even in modern hospitals other cultures give birth standing or squatting. Let gravity help. Putting a woman in labor in bed stated in France as a fashion statement -- not because it was good for the mom and baby. U can read up on this.. Good luck.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	The same way you got pregnant is the most effective way to start the labor process. Have sex. Seriously this is the most proven method for starting labor. Walking a lot is a close second.|`|lzUF22l0aa	hay i just drank castor oil a little while ago so if you want to e-mail me later on and i can let you know how thats working out for me ... i am 2 centimeters and my cervix is really soft i was told today so i figured id try the castor oil|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	pineapple, sex, nipple stimulation, and walking|`|8Vg4JrbSaa	Sex|`|sEihaeLNaa	try sex and walk a bit
WPI0Z47saa	You start potty training when the child shows signs of being ready such as: waking up with a fry diaper, going long periods of time in between diapers, when they complain that they don't like the feeling of their dirty diaper and start telling you when they are going or already went. You will know but never try to force them or make them sit on the potty for long periods of time if they can't go because this could frustrate and discourage the child and make the process take longer. I actully kept my son in his crib as long as he didn't mind it and didn't try to climb out. He was actually about 2 1/2 because we never had problems with him. But when he started complaining as soon as he woke up that he wanted "out" and attempted to climb over the edge we bought him the toddlers bed. I slept next to him for the first few nights to teach him to stay in the bed. I still keep a baby monitor in there so i know if he is walking around but he did very well.<br>  <br>  So Potty - when the child is ready<br>  And bed -  when you have to lol.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	she sounds ready to start both, i'd say!<br>  <br>  at first, you may want to just put a toddler bed in her room & give her the choice of which to use.<br>  <br>  and to potty train, i'm starting that w/my 12 month old. nothing pushy, i just put her on the potty chair before & after going to sleep & meals, and whenever i use the bathroom (so i can keep an eye on her & provide an example at the same time). i also change her diapers in the bathroom. so far, nothing, but no biggie! it's way early :)|`|jjV0aikbaa	I think it just depends if your daughter is ready. ANd only you really know that. If she's not ready and you try too soon, things aren't going to work out. I put my daughter in a bed at 18 months. I also tried to start potty training, but she wasn't potty trained going both in her potty until she was 22 months.|`|28QPS6V9aa	I say fifteen months for both. Your daughter sounds ready to me. I suggest buying a twin size mattress instead of a toddler bed though. That way she won't outgrow it anytime soon and it will save you money in the long run. They are just as safe as a toddler bed if you put guard rails up. Just an idea! :)|`|6VR19YQWaa	I think she is more than ready for a toddler bed. My kids went in them even before they could walk, and got used to staying in the early. Then there was never a problem with them learning to stay in like some people have.<br>  <br>  The potty training. .....from 22 years of working with small children, I have found that most girls are ready way before the boys. It seems to challenge them. I say set her on it a few times and see what happens. If she's fairly predictable about her potty times, such as after nap, etc...then set her there then...and see if she can go. If she does....make it out to be the best thing since heat!....Tell her how proud you are of her....really show her you are proud!. I find that girls, especially, soak this up. If you wait too long to  start training, then they get stubborn. Pleasing you isn't nearly as fun once they get to 2 and a half or so....doing exactly the opposite seems more challenging to them by that time. Do it sooner rather than later. However, most kids probably won't have results until about 18months or a bit later. Don't put pressure on her, but encourage her greatly! I have found that a small reward for using the potty helps. I have always used stickers. They can decorate the potty, put them on a chart or just wear them. They get tired of the stickers about the time they are pretty well trained.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	From my experience with my daughter, don't do the toddler bed til around 3. I thought that seemed excessive but once my daughter was 2 I put her in one and she never stayed in it, would cry and cry if I tried and eventually would come in my room to sleep. My sis and some good friends waited until 3 and they had no problems. As far as the potty training I would wait to try until she is at least 2. Once she shows signs like coming to you when she is wet or dirty, showing interest in the toilet, can tell you she peed or pooped and can speak well enough to communicate that sort of thing then you can give it a go.  I started potty training at 2 with my daughter and she wanted nothing to do with it. Eventually she did it on her own the summer before her 3rd birthday. Good luck!|`|D8vOpNWgaa	my son was 8 months when he went to a toddler bed and that's young i think but he could get out of his crib because of a defect with the crib. i would wake up to find him in his brothers bed. i then just tossed the crib and got another toddler bed and had no prob with him sleeping in it. now with the potty training i would say you can introduce her to it but don't think she would get it down till she is about 2 but its with a try to start if you have the time and make it fun|`|mIuUQ4ehaa	Hi i have come from a big family and i am one of the oldest and my little brother is 2 and he is just started potty training. So it is up to you what you want to do, you can teach her now or older. you choose :D|`|9jkfkZVAaa	There is no really exact age to potty train them. Girls from my experience are easier to train that boys and can be potty trained earlier. My suggestion is to try daytime potty training to see how she reacts. Some kids will take right too it and others will fight it. So give it a try for a few days and see how she takes to it. If she just "isn't having it" then hold off a few weeks and try again. <br>  <br>  As for the toddler bed there are a few things to think about. <br>  <br>  Does she get up in the morning before you do? If so are you prepared to get up before her since once she is in a toddler's bed she can just roam the house if no one is up.<br>  <br>  Next thing is does she know how to get out of her crib by herself? This can be dangerous for a small child so ideally a toddler's bed with a guard rail is better.<br>  <br>  These are just things to consider. Good luck =)
Ccq8zEcnaa	I've seen some pictures where the 3D of the baby is identical to what they look like at birth. But some pictures I've seen looked like the baby may have just gotten plumper.. I don't think the actual facial bone structure or features change all that much, the baby may just pack on more fat, making it look a little different.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	His overall facial features will stay the same, he will just gain some more baby fat in the face.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Probably the only change you'll notice is fuller cheeks. At 29 weeks your baby is already formed. Now all thats left is fattening up.
b8f0CfSsaa	It is possible to have them symptoms early (aside from back ache, that comes at about 6-8 weeks as your uterus naturally expands prior to growth), however it is rare. Sometimes when you are hoping to become pregnant you imagine the symptoms...lets hope their really there and this is your month!<br>  <br>  Good luck with TTC|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	This is the curse of TTC, symptoms could be nothing, or could be something!  I hates that when I was TTC.  I will say the month I conceived, I had symptoms at 6 DPO, so it is possible, and the months I conceived things were very different than in the prior five cycles we had tried.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope you can look back and say these were pregnancy symptoms!!!|`|JjBwydymaa	Hunni....your the only person who knows your body!!! So if you think your experiencing something a little strange...then it just maybe related to a possible pregnancy!<br>  <br>  I have done so much research to day on implantation... because I am 5DPO and having a burning sensation (thats the only way I can describe it, but it really dosnt hurt) near my pubic bone. And I thought to myself...no it cant be, its far too easy for any implantation to take place..<br>  <br>  However what I found...is that it differs for every woman. And implantation has known to happen around 3DPO (very early and a rare case). But doctors do say that implantation will take place around 6-12 days past ovulation. That is probs just an average number...so it could happen before or even after the estimated time. <br>  <br>  And alot of the time people tell me that im probs making the symptoms up and its all in my head.....but TTC doesn't stress me out very much. I believe if its meant to be it will happen and if it doesn't than there is always...next month! So why would I bother making things up.....?<br>  <br>  Good luck hunni... But dont let yourself get your hopes up...just in case its not your month! xxx|`|E6obQSpraa	I think 7dpo is waaaay too early for symptoms. Implantation takes between 7 - 10 days to take place, it may not have even implanted yet.<br>  <br>  The only way to know is taking a test after your period is due.|`|AA12112190	Could be anything really I had that when I had a uti  but it could be symptoms of pg Good Luck and God Bless!!!|`|BO28Mn8haa	test 5 days after your missed period :)|`|tdNfQWaAaa	Some women say they can tell when they have concieved almost instantly. So I would say its not to early for symptoms.<br>  <br>  I'm 6-8 dpo and I'm having some of your symptoms too. Or its also in my head. I have been cramping the last few days, my boobs have been sore and heavy feeling, I've had headaches, heartburn, and I seem to be peeing a little more. So hopefully its not in our heads and this is our month!!! Keep your fingers crossed and lots of baby dust!!!|`|rKCpkBfmaa	How do you when you had ovulation? You NEVER know that for sure, unless you've monitored your cycle with a doctor.<br>  <br>  Anyway - it's rather in your head, honey, as it's too early to feel anything. Pregnancy hormones have not started their job yet, so even if you've been pregnant - you wouldn't have been feeling anything strange.<br>  <br>  (Sorry, my english is not perfect) :)
QidW9DRfaa	I smack my niece when it is the extreme end of the point. If they are putting themselves in danger or are being disrespectful a smack on the hand or on the bottom sees the end of the matter.<br>  I don't like to do it but kids need to know that some lessons are hard and have to be learned the hard way<br>  <br>  Yes, I was smacked as a child, I didn't like it but i bloody well never did it (the specific offence) again.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	There is no law stating that we are not allowed to smack children.  Somebody was trying to pass it through Parliament but the PM at the time said that it wasn't the governments right to tell parents how to punish their child.  <br>  <br>  Your school nurse is trying to scare you but do what you feel is right.  Try it and if it doesn't work then try something else.  I would speak to the counsellor and see what they say about punishing your child after they have talked to him.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I do not like the idea of smacking.<br>  <br>  But Spanking, yes.....problem is you have to start that when they are REALLY young.  Otherwise it just won't work.<br>  <br>  When we were kids my Dad only had to spank each of us ONE time.<br>  Then all it took was a look or a word and we whipped right into shape.<br>  <br>  Parents now a days are afraid to spank their kids.  It is a shame.|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	my mom has smacked me and now i guess i deserved it, but she felt so bad and hasn't done it for a long time...i didn't know there was a law<br>  people probably don't take it seriously|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Back when we could hit our wives they were more controllable and obedient, so let's bring that back too. Hitting is only used by people who can't form an intelligent point so hit out of fustration.|`|sK8ZhTahaa	What new law?<br>  There is no law against smacking in the UK.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well we are in britain....<br>  let me tell me about my nephew...he is now 16 and has been up in court TWICE my sister has tried verything except smacking...she did and to piss her off he called his social work and my sister (who had bruises and a gash on her eyebrow) got fined...he walked away with a smug look (now in youth offenders intitute) shocking huh! teh social work department told her she was out of order and breaking the law..her reply was well clearly punching pillows and removing the tv is not working ug  BRITAIN IS BECOMING  f***ing JOKE...excuse my french;)|`|S5H0NmEWaa	No. I was never smacked and it didn't do me any harm.<br>  <br>  Physical violence against children is never acceptable. I can understand a gentle smack if a child is in danger - about to touch an oven door, for instance - but beating a kid teaches them nothing - except that violence is acceptable.<br>  <br>  The defence of smacking is a straw man argument, put up by people who have no wish to consider the real causes of current social and emotional problems. The real problems include adult selfishness, resentment of the comparative wealth and freedom of today's youth, and ignorance of the fundamentals of child development. <br>  <br>  If only people were more willing to think and less keen to sanction physical violence.|`|FPiNH71uaa	My parents used to smack me, they still do when i'm being unreasonable. There is a law about smacking, your not allowed to leave a mark i.e bruise etc. But i have heard of people getting into trouble for smacking their kids even though they are keeping to this law, usually because their kids report them.|`|m7d4CO1vaa	i have two little girls and i tap them on there hands when they are being naughty, the law might say that but what they dont tell you is that you are allowed to smack your children as long as you dont hit them hard enought to leave a mark.<br>  i know this as i have friends who work for social services.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	No. I feel as though smacking teaches the child to be violent when some one offends them, me and my sisters were never smacked and my partner and his family never were either and we have all been very well behaved as teens and children!<br>  <br>  Texas Momma, I agree entirely on the permissive parenting, you have managed to put my sentiments in to words!|`|iMaTMWMxaa	No, I don't smack my children.<br>  <br>  I have done on possibly 3 occasions, to try and get them to not touch the cooker, for example. I found it didn't work anyway, so I don't do it.<br>  <br>  Also, I can remember being smacked. It felt degrading.|`|UdVCjylwaa	I have tapped my Granson on the bottom not hard it hert his feeling more that any phisical pain but I do comand more repect from him than anyone else in the family he will also come to me to sort out his problems I think smacking is a last resort and not to be given only in the extreme but it does work no matter what all the do gooders say|`|v4xIauuYaa	It is so hard to control kids these days years ago everyone got a smack but today your the one who gets in trouble if you try and control you child. <br>  The goverment would rather have them taking drugs and out of control than let parents smack them worlds gone mad.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	tie him up and throw him in the basement and don't feed him for a week.|`|Ryiw5rZRaa	Sara A<br>  You are wrong, it is not against the law to smack, get your facts straight before you start ranting.<br>  <br>  My teenage daughter came home drunk one night, I slapped her when she got agressive, she phoned the Police and they took her away for the night, social services brought her back the next day and I was prepared for a right fight with them but they were completely on my side and gave her a right dressing down and told her not to do it again or she would be in trouble.|`|rScVpWguaa	i have never smacked my son, he is only young but is defiantley going through a phase of really testing me, i can see how this is the point where i can influence him into becoming either a well behaved child, or an aggressive one who will lash out. but it would NEVER EVER cross my mind to give him a wack back wen it hits me!there ARE other ways, i dont care what anyone says, me and my brothers were never hit as children or teenagers and we have never been in trouble with the police or lashed out at our parents, i dont mean 2 b painting a little angel picure, but i totally believe that your children turn into the people you make them. and im not saying that if your child isnt well behaved 24/7 you havent been a good parent, theres just different ways to go about discipline and you have to find a responsible way without physical violence.|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	I think it's a tricky one and opinions can differ depending on the child's age. I think if the child is under, say, 8 years old and you administer a smack because of bad behaviour a lot of people wouldn't bat an eyelid but once the child is older, particularly teenage, people start ranting about abuse. We're not talking belting our kids here, people! <br>  <br>  I'm in agreement with you - my older brother was dreadful to live with when we were teenagers and my parents would often resort to administering a smack (though they'd feel pretty dreadful when doing this), but nobody said anything when he lashed out at my mum and hit her.<br>  <br>  Politcal correctness gone mad.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Actually I don't believe you'd be in more trouble.  You spanked (smacked) to correct.  He would have hit you back to hurt you.<br>  <br>  In the states, if my son hit me back if I spanked him, my black eye would get him jail time.  My spanking him on his backside is just considered physical discipline.  (Hypothetically speaking... I don't actually spank my kids though).<br>  <br>  But I don't believe that kids are automatically more obedient if you spank them.  I don't spank.  My kids are fine.  I'd don't look down others who do spank, but I also don't assume that their kids are better behaved than mine.<br>  <br>  I think kids were better behaved before this "permissive" parenting came around.  God forbid we "break the spirit" of our kids by telling them no or enforcing boundaries.  THAT is the problem with kids today.  Too many freedoms, not enough boundaries.|`|kprKXEOSaa	Your son is going to have some serious problems, whether or not you smack him.  If he's lashing out at police, he's going to end up in prison.  You may need to take advantage of any services available to you to help your son get back on track.  You should also consider military school, if such a thing is available there.  <br>  If you're afraid your son would hit you back, you shouldn't start a physical confrontation with him, especially if he's your size or bigger.  Males are stronger, even if he's a little smaller than you he could take you down.<br>  If his father is in the picture, he should try to handle this.  If not, or if that doesn't work, you may need to consider other options for your son--it sounds like he's out of your control.|`|n7uoE9wmaa	No there is no law against it new or otherwise, unfortunately most social "workers" are a bunch of namby pamby handwringers who think that they write and enforce the law.  The sooner they are taken down a few pegs the better; now we are in recession I can see no better place to start wholesale redundancies than in social services departments!|`|CuTvFlxTaa	BRITAIN and its bent rules!!!!! Ive got all day to moan. Sometimes you wonder why you bother here. If discipline does not start at home then what chance to we have with unruly kids. I think the law originally brought in in Scotland sucks. Some 50 years ago they got cained in school and belted at home. Did we have any unruly youths back then? NO! All the rules brought in have made this country ASBO friendly. If that was me I'd still smack my child. If they jailed me then I'd go to the papers and cause up roar!|`|A1S5KNUkaa	This is what happened to me....<br>  <br>  When my daughter (who is now 4) was with her childminder I arrived to collect her.  She was at the 'terrible threes' (it is not restricted to two year olds lol) stage and decided to have a full on tantrum.  I calmly talked to her, coaxed her, bribed her to calm down and get her coat on to no avail.  When I tried to get close to her she started lashing out (had never seen her do this before) and bearing in mind that there were other children in the room that she would've lashed out at and a lot of lego pieces on the floor which would have hurt her if she'd thrown herself I literally TAPPED her on the bottom (she had pull ups on so wouldn't have even felt it) purely to shock her since nothing else was working.  It did work and she calmed down straight away and happily came home.<br>  <br>  The next day my childminder informed me that she had had to report the incident to social services as I had done it in her home yet if I'd done it out on the street she wouldn't have done a thing.  She also told me that she'd told them that my daughter had never had a mark on her, I had only tapped her bottom and my daughter was in no way intimidated or scared by me and in the 15 months she'd been looking after her it had never happened before.<br>  <br>  Not long after I received a visit from social services who INTERVIEWED my little girl, my son (who was 6 at the time) and myself on two seperate occasions.  I had also just suffered a miscarriage and my grandmother had passed away.<br>  <br>  I was told that smacking (or tapping in my case) was not against the law yet they had to follow it up.   Surely, given that they were told that it was a one off and not even a smack meant that my daughter was not at risk!?  The case was immediately dropped but I'm too scared to even look at my kids the wrong way now...just in case!|`|MvC6n3DWaa	It is the same in the US. Smacking is a short term solution. It teaches the child how to smack, and only about the specific situation. The long term solution, employing restrictions, is more tiresome -but it works. A lot of people quote the bible saying 'spare the rod, spoil the child'. What they do not realize is that the rod was used by shephards to guide the sheep, not beat them! We need to guide our children and it can be exhausting. If you start young, it is easier when they get older. There are no short cuts.<br>  <br>  I would like to suggest the use of a Behavior Analyst. This will provide techniques in handling your son and ensuring that he is taught discipline and self control. That is the goal.

tYyANk8Baa	Hey there hun...I am 36 weeks pregnant with my 2nd.  I know exactly how you feel.  I had the same discharge with BOTH my pregnancies and it is just fine!  As long as the discharge is brown and not red, there is nothing to worry about.  It is either old blood that is making its way out, or just residue from the baby attaching itself to the uterus!!  Trust me, I was at the ER both times I had it!  :o)|`|yo3zUApyaa	You may bleed or spot a bit shortly after you become pregnant, and it isn't anything to worry about unless it happens often.  It happened to me also.  What happens is the egg will implant itself in the wall of your uterus, and that will sometimes cause minor cramps or bleeding, the bleeding is called implantation bleeding.  If you are really worried about something, always talk to your doctor about it, but I'm betting that is what it is.  Hope your morning sickness isn't too bad.  :)  And Congrats!|`|6pxLm72zaa	yes some women have periods through out there pregnancy and others have spotting so it should be alright if u start hurting and feeling bad and bleeding more go to the emergency room and get checked out i had 2 miscarages before this pregnancy and ur ok unless u start bleeding alot like a period then i would go get checked but u should be fine for know|`|0c2d52d9d2a37dd0ef833700ac7163c4aa	Firstly congratulations :)<br>  Secondly, don't worry its perfectly normal the same thing happened to me and it was all ok, i mean some women still get their period all the way through the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  All the best and Good Luck|`|RjdrO7DVaa	brown discharge is normal .. stop stressing!  the bloated and crampy feelings might not go away .. ooh the joys of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  as for the headaches, you may take tylenol but only as directed by your OB so call him/her and make sure they'll let you take it|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Your period was probably due recently and that is a very common thing to have some sort of spotting around the time it is due. Congratulations:)|`|pNPJH1WBaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I had that. If it is dark brown then it is old blood can sometimes be from your previous period apparently and has only just decided to come out. I was told only to worry if it was red blood like if you cut yourself. As for the other symptoms it is normal in pregnancy for some women. Others are more lucky and sail through with hardly any symptoms! <br>  <br>  Dont be scared. It happened to me and I have a beautiful boy. If it happens again and you are worried or if it comes out red then why not phone your local maternity ward and ask to talk to the midwife on duty. Or ask to talk to your doctor over the phone for 2 minutes!|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	w/ you being so early its very normal, i would not worry!!<br>  <br>  i bled week 5-12 and still have spotting, and when i say bled i mean red blood w/ clots every single day!! drs still dont know why<br>  <br>  im now 17 weeks and i still spot here and there, blood is a very scary thing in pregnancy but let your dr know everything and if your ever nervous call them!<br>  <br>  plus until your 20 weeks pregnant they can't do anything if you do bleed, i was told unless i am changing a pad every hour im fine, and as long as i dont stand up and have blood running down my legs im fine|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	if the discharge would have been bright red - you would need to see doctor right away <br>  <br>  but brown or light pink or really light red is fine <br>  <br>  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!|`|WljG2gXsaa	Dont stress out. Stressing is the worst thing. That is normal, it could be caused by implantation or around dah time you were supposed to get your period. But since your preggo and your period didnt come your just having a little spotting. Completely normal. Good Luck, hope everything goes good for you :)|`|VNQHUIo1aa	yeah it can be very yucky...but it's okay...but when u do go the to doc..just ask to be safe...Good luck|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	Congratulations!

fOxS7EE7aa	that's crazy!<br>  <br>  you can only take clomid a maximum 5 days for each cycle.  i've never heard any instance where it was taken 15 days in a row!<br>  <br>  and you know, taking clomid for a prolonged period (more than 6 cycles) can cause ovarian cysts, and hyper ovarian stimulation.  which can permanently damage her chances of a baby.<br>  <br>  please tell your friend to seek a second opinion before she drinks anything!|`|S5n5Za78aa	i dont think so your friend needs to get a diff doc ive never heard of that she must be really going through it thats way to much docs only prescribed that drug 5 days out of your period and TID (3 times a day ) thats 150mg but dang 15 days never heard of thats sounds dangerous <br>   clomid -induces ovulation<br>  metformin - treats the pcos|`|CUanPEmeaa	My question is are you sure it wasn't three months worth, 5days each month. That would sound right. But 3 pills aday that would mean 150mgs just starting out that seems high to me, i thought most started out at 50 or 100. I would definately have her go back and get things straightened up.|`|AA11116434	Clomid can be prescribed many different ways. I took it for both of my babies, and took 2 pills at once on day 3-7. I was also on a high 100 mg dosage. I did not use a trigger shot either time, since I ovulated fine with the clomid.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of 3 times a day for 15 days for Clomid. She should call the pharmacy to confirm that.|`|YkX0GZoOaa	Yeah that is definitely weird. Actually, 100 mg of clomid isn't a high dosage. It's pretty normal.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	For the next week just keep an eye on how he does use his right arm.<br>  <br>  For example does he reach out with both arms, does he pass toys back and forth.  When he used to tripod sit did he sometimes lean on the right arm.  If he cruises will he use his right, or both arms at the same time, to pull up; does he use the right and left arm to support himself while cruising.  Try to encourage him to do the same activity with both arms (like pulling up by holding your hands).  You just want to make sure he seems to have more or less the same amount of strength and range of motion with each arm (and leg).<br>  <br>  All of us have our own unique ways of doing things, and normally one arm and one leg is somewhat stronger.  But there shouldn't be a significant difference|`|8WRnqs08aa	LOL.... I'm picturing my little girl as I respond to you!

8a60141ea10cc0c778578bb0f86b6be3aa	The only sure fire way not to get pregnant is not to have sex, period.  Even those birth control methods that are 99% effective have a 1% chance of getting pregnant -- or like the guy in the movie says, So 97% effective means 3% bloody ineffective . . .<br>  <br>  Yep, that's right . . .<br>  <br>  (It was a really cute Hugh Grant movie . . .)|`|1s3nddaYaa	How effective is Depo-Provera?<br>  Depo-Provera is 99.7% effective.<br>  <br>  That fact definitely stands on its own. Depo-Provera is among the most effective methods on the market—and you can't use it the wrong way. As long as you get a dose every 11 to 13 weeks, you're protected. Feeling confident about your birth control feels good.<br>  <br>  It's different, for example, with the Pill. You're supposed to take the Pill at the same time every day. But if you don't, then the Pill may not work as well. Depo-Provera just works. And it starts working right away. There's no waiting period, no back-up methods necessary. That's confidence. That's freedom.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Yes you can get pregnant on the shot, but its very rare. <br>  Your Dr should have told you how long to wait until its in effect.  I believe it's only a day or two though.|`|XulwuKi9aa	yes it is a possible to get pregnant.  I would use a condom for about a month.  And also remember that the shot do not prevent you from std.  good luck and god bless|`|IlwqMtWQaa	yes. the shot is only really effective if you eat the same basic foods and do the same amount of exercise every day. Otherwise its only like 70% effective.|`|29a2wm7Eaa	It's billed that once you've had the shot you can't.  As long as you weren't before you had it.
vue9NOhYaa	I have never cared much for the WTE books ... if anything, they are overparanoid about things. (Esp. diet ... God forbid you should let a grain of sugar pass your lips...)<br>  <br>  I would ask your OB about current recommendations on specific foods and chemicals to avoid (these change so rapidly that no book can be up to date), and then browse the bookstore for a general pregnancy book that you feel comfortable with. (My philosophies would lean toward's Martha Sears' "Pregnancy Book.")|`|EULVtVDvaa	What to Expect is a great reference but I did not care for it . It might as well tell you to never leave the house .|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Personally, I love the What to Expect when You Are Expecting book. <br>  Yes you can clean your house, you just want to stay away from harsh chemicals like bleach. <br>  I went out and bought Mr Clean and some eco friendly products, it calmed my nerves.|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	i'm not sure what books you should get for dos and donts but i know what to expect has a lot of info for you.  for some comic relief try jenny mccarthys books, belly laughs, and her other one baby laughs.  they're really funny and provide a lot of info. congrats!|`|1cRANJXNaa	Yea it tells you alot of info pretty good book to get.|`|7DQaZ9LYaa	thats a GREAT book. definetly get it!
0SHOXqb4aa	I know of woman who have been in a position where the baby is "floating high and free", meaning that labour has started but the baby's head has not engaged, showing that there is insufficient space for the baby to come out.  But you can't normally know that this early.  Your wife is still 10 days from her due date.  <br>  <br>  I don't think a doctor can tell just by examination.  Make sure you get another opinion, and if the answer is the same, make sure you get an explanation as to why they think your wife's pelvis is too small.  <br>  <br>  Usually a woman is allowed to start labour and then have a c section if things don't progress.  Ask why she is being denied this chance.  I don't know where in the world you are, but if you are in the U.S. then many more c- sections are done there than in the U.K.  <br>  <br>  If they think there is a high chance of a c-section being necessary, then she can opt to have an epidural from the start so that if a c-section becomes necessary, she is all ready.|`|AA11210211	I say try for the vaginal delivery first,I have the same problem as your wife,my pelvic bone is small so a child can't fit also my cervix doesn't want to dilate,I can never give birth vaginally.I have had 2 c-sections and they suck.I say try vaginal then decide on a c-section.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Elective C-Sections are generally not recomended.  <br>  See what your Dr. thinks.  If the Dr thinks it's okay to try for a vaginal delivery, then go for it.   Just be prepared, any delivery may turn into a situation where an emergency c-section is needed. <br>  And if that is the case, just roll with the punches.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	If your doctor suggests that you should have the Csection there is probably a god reason for it but if you question it I would ask him what the issues are with having a vaginal birth. It's a harder recovery from a C-section form my understanding and most people have Csections with every subsequent child. I've personally never had one but I was there when a friend of mine had one she was in no pain she said and it was kinda nice to see the baby right away rather than waiting for labor. Ask the doctor, he can tell you more. Good luck and congrats on your baby!|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I know how you feel.  Of course normal delivery is the best way to go if you have an option, but as you say your wife is having some complications and if the doctor is advising you to have c-section than I guess you should go with your doctor.|`|VNQHUIo1aa	Just talk to the doc. maybe there is still hope..but if not then just hope for a healthy baby.....Good luck|`|f9lZK2aKaa	If her OB thinks a C-Section is the way to go, I would go with the professionals decision. I understand that this is freightening but it is what seems to be safest for your wife and your baby. With her pelvis being small, I would guess the doctor feels the baby too large for her to endure a long painful labor that will likely turn into an emergency c-section. I will pray for you both as well as for your baby. <br>  God Bless!!|`|Zew5sfbyaa	in the end your wife has the choice the dr is just letting you know what she thinks is best in your situation. What could happen if your wife is too small to deliver she could spend hours in labor just to then have to have a c-section because the baby either gets stuck in the birth canal or goes into distress. I would go with what the dr says because it could save your wife a lot of pain. Good Luck|`|N2p30Mo4aa	If the doctor recommends a c-section, good chance thats the best way to go
703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I love my microsteam bags made by Medela.  You buy a pack of five for about $5, and can use each one 20 times (total of 100 uses for $5).  You just put your parts and 2 oz of water in the bag and microwave it for a couple of minutes.  That disinfects without you having to boil a pot of water!  It's great for when you're at work, too.<br>  <br>  Other than that, the little white flexible membranes (that fit on the valves) sometimes need to be replaced completely.  You'll know because the pump will be working, but you'll lose suction anyway.  They are a very small but vital part of the assembly.  And for the tubing, I'd personally buy new one for each baby or if mildew began to appear.  Everything else is sturdy and so easy to disinfect, I wouldn't worry about it.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Whenever they become damaged or worn.  There's no way to tell because it depends on how often you use them, how you clean them, etc|`|EeGgovyCaa	You don't, just clean them after every use.|`|fMilDRgLaa	I agree with JennyAlice, but you may need to change your tubing at times. If you notice it getting cloudy, milk gets backed into the tubing and you can't get it cleaned properly then change out your tubing. Many people think because this does not come in direct contact with your milk you don't need to worry about it.  I changed out my tubing between both of my toddlers. When I pulled my tubing out with the second child it just looked dingy. You can buy tubing through www.medela.com or at breastfeeding supply stores for about $4.00 a piece.
IoWoDxG8aa	Red pee? That means you may have a urinary tract infection especially if you have the urge to urinate often and it burns. You need to go to the ER and tell them that you have blood in your urine and they will give you antibiotics. <br>  <br>  You should really pee after you have sex and wipe front to back or blot.

s4LWmcTjaa	I've read them.  And then I tossed them right out the door!<br>  <br>  Parenting books are someone's attempt to sell their way of parenting as the right way.  In truth there is no set right way that works miracles for all children.  I prefer to draw on my own experiences and the experiences of parents that I respect and value the opinions of.  Different children required different methods of raising them, teaching them, guiding them and discipline.<br>  <br>  Parenting books *can* be good resources, but I don't rely on them for my instruction manual to raising kids.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I read the James Dobson or Focus on the Family books. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.focusonthefamily.com/</a>|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I really liked the Happiest Toddler and Baby ones,  for language development, sleeping, discipline, etc.   They are my favorite, and sometimes give them as shower gifts.  <br>  <br>  Netflix also has the DVDs on them.
t4HXotwEaa	I think grey is very pretty with pink and brown.  also, that bright peach.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	We are doing pink, green, and yellow polka dots. It's so cute so far. You could paint the wall a light pink and do different shades of brown polka dots. Painting polka dots is really easy. I have a stencil and to do two walls only took me like 1 hour and 45 mins. I did it all by my self and I am 30 weeks pregnant. here is a link to view my pics of her nursery, it;s not finished but it gives you and idea. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/35841260@N06/3314506618/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/35841260@N0...</a><br>  <br>  I really like the google Image you have linked.|`|DutTBV3caa	hers a few walpapers that might look ok. <br>  <a href="http://www.usawallpaper.com/pibrsqwabo1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.usawallpaper.com/pibrsqwabo1....</a><br>  maybe you could do like a darker shade of pink?<br>  <br>  i think your best bet would be to actually go to where ever youre buying the wallpaper from and check out what they have. also they probably have people working there who are better at the design aspect then us yahoo answer people :)<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  oh and i think its really good that you're still doing the pink and brown even though a lot of other people are. way to stick with what you like instead of doing what you think other will! :)|`|CpiLHcTlaa	i love those colors together for starter! maybe for the bottom go with a darker pink?  and the wallpaper to split it what about sort of brown with animals or flowers on it? or green. mint green looks really good with pink and brown<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.housebeautiful.com/decorating/paint-colors/" rel="nofollow">http://www.housebeautiful.com/decorating...</a> <br>  <br>  try this program i think its bed room a that has split walls.|`|qicxk5GMaa	what about pink on top, like a brown border wall paper then on the bottom do thick verticle pink and brown stripes.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	How about polka dots in darker pink and brown?|`|qej62zhDaa	What about doing pink at the bottom, the border (i love the wallpaper site too) and a light shade of brown at the top? And if you wanna maybe pink polka dots on the brown?|`|qHa4w8eyaa	First of all, congrats!  What an exciting time for you. :) <br>  <br>  If I understand correctly, you want to put up some sort of border to divide the walls?  Pink on the top would be nice - But I highly suggest that you pick a fainter colour than you actually want to see up there.  Somehow colours look a lot more intense when they are applied to an entire wall!  As for your second colour, the one on the lower part of the wall.  First, make sure that it's of the same intensity as the light pink.  You're right about the brown blending with the furniture too much - plus, it'll absorb light instead of reflecting it - and you really don't want a dark room.  A warm cream might brighten it up, and will tie the pink and brown together nicely - It sounds like you are going for somewhat of a sophisticated look given your choice of colours.  Before you pick that second colour, though, purchase your wallpaper.  You might find the perfect colour in it, and you won't have to do any more guesswork.  You might also consider wallpapering just a single wall...it makes for a lovely effect too. <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide, I think it'll all come together beautifully in the end. :)  Best of luck with your growing family. :)
NaJPIOheaa	yes it is, it is possible to ovulate on CD6, and that is usually a day after you get your period! If you get your period fairly early(should be in 2 weeks), this will prove that you did ovulate earlier like you thought. Good luck xo|`|dlOFWcU4aa	Yes.  I have two children and was told that they both were conceived the day after AF left!  Good luck to you!|`|FIxo73Mdaa	Definitely.  Your pre-ovulatory phase can vary in length each cycle.  It is the luteal phase (the time between ovulation and your period) that is a pretty set length of time.
NaJPIOheaa	Hey dear, to me it sounds like you are ovulating, and since your TTC, i'd be BD! Sometimes our body just does crazy things, such as ovulating early. My last cycle i ovulated a few days after AF! That was crazy for me. I'm reading a book called "taking charge of your fertility" and it talks about the mucous you described, and if it blood tinged, that is perfectly fine because its from the egg releasing. Your also right about implantation though, if you did ovulate earlier, it could be implantation bleeding! Just to be on the safe side i'd be BDing anyways, and wait to see if AF shows! Good luck & tons of baby dust xo|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I would say more than likely ovulation bleeding. You would have had to have ovulated while on your period in order for it to be implantation. I would be sure to have sex the next few days because it sounds like ovulation to me. I get this every now and then. It may not happen to you every month, our bodies are so crazy its hard to figure out sometimes.
UghJ0XROaa	I don't know if you have Gerber where you are at or not, i found they have jars of mashed potatoes, with different tastes in them, a little chunky though. But they are veggie mashed potatoes and i know they have a sweet potato one with carrots, it has soft carrot lumps in it, but that was a huge hit and a different taste for my daughter. I just don't know if he is ready for it yet or if you can even buy it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just looked it up and if you do search, it says that meats can be introduced after they are successfully eating cereal, fruits and veggies, so i assume that the meat substitutes would work the same.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT-As a parent you are right, we make choices for them until they are capable of making their own. You have every right in the world to instill a vegetarian diet on him. Also you said that you giving him the choice to be a vegetarian or not when he is capable of making his own decisions. The only way i would feel you are "forcing" him, is if he makes the decision to eat a piece of lunch meat and you do nothing but yell and scream at him. That would be forcing him to do something. Vegetarians can get adequate vitamins and minerals from alternative sources. Kudos on you sticking to it!|`|ZkDmJtAsaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I do not think it is logical or ethical to force a child to become a vegetarian at such as young age. Doing so would risk his health and well being.<br>  <br>  "Infants of any age on a<br>  restrictive vegetarian diet, such as macrobiotic or<br>  fruitarian, are placed at significant risk for growth<br>  abnormalities, serious nutritional deficiencies, and<br>  health problems."<br>  <br>  I would seriously consider speaking with my doctor to determine if a child SHOULD be brought up as vegetarian. There are plenty of ethical choices of meat products out there that will ensure his proper growth.<br>  <br>  Man was made as a omnivore, not a herbivore. Your choice of becoming a vegetarian is commendable and I understand completely why you would do so. Had I have to actually raise, kill, clean, and prepare my meat I would most likely be vegetarian also.<br>  <br>  But to force your choice onto a child and risk his health is questionable.  Please consult your doctor, as your choice is commendable but forcing your child to be vegetarian might be unhealthy.|`|x647LeB2aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I'm not a vegetarian but my sister-in-law is and she has 3 children with my brother (a non-veggie)<br>  <br>  The children were bought up as vegetarians until they were old enough to make a choice (and 2 of them now eat meat)<br>  <br>  As babies can eat 'table food' from six months you can feed your son whatever you are having.  You don't need to puree it, just roughly mash it with a fork or cut into small pieces.  I have read that you said that he gags but all babies do this when they first start with finger foods but it doesn't take long for them to get used to chewing.<br>  <br>  My son is a meat eater but also has things like veggie pizza, toast, macaroni cheese, cauliflower cheese, baked beans, spaghetti with tomato sauce, garlic bread and jacket potato.  While at my brother's last week he had veggie bolognaise and pasta shells.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I disagree with california boy.   All parents instill there eating habits on there children.  Some parents eat nothing but junk food and instill those habits on their children, yet they don't seem to get as attacked as a parent that decides to raise there child a vegetarian.  <br>  <br>  As you son moves onto different foods, just be sure to offer a wide variety of different grains, fruits, and vegetables to insure proper vitamins and minerals.  This is totally possible on a vegetarian diet.  <br>  Beans can be a great source of proteins, and green vegetables can provide plenty of iron.  <br>  He really is still getting everything she needs from breastmilk or formula at this point, so there is no need to worry about his solid intake as much. <br>  When he begins moving onto table foods, at that point it will be easier to offer a wider variety of foods.  My best advice to you is read up on nutrition contents of different veggies, and that way you will know you are providing adequate nutrition from them .<br>  <br>  Note*   Several babies with parents who are not vegetarians have babies that prefer to have a vegetarian diet, which is completely fine and they go on to be just as healthy as any other baby.

Ldvi6UPOaa	To me this sounds that you did ovulate on your first round of Clomid, you probably just had a delayed ovulation which caused your period to be late too or it could of just been natural period. I have heard that Clomid delays ovulation, but I'm not sure because before using Clomid I didn't ovulate for years so I wouldn't know anything about delayed ovulation.  I just don't understand why your doctor told you to take Provera if your period started. Did you do a blood test to check if you ovulated on your first round of Clomid? Did that come back negative.<br>  <br>  I would suggest going to www.fertilityties.com and ask a doctor's opinion for free. To me it just doesn't make since that your doctor told you take take provera again.<br>  <br>  When your natural period started, did you take the Clomid? If you didn't then that's probably why your doctor said to take take the Provera to bring on another period so you can start taking Clomid again.<br>  <br>  Please keep us posted hun!!!! Good luck!!!|`|fOxS7EE7aa	i think it's time you get an opinion from a different doctor.<br>  <br>  from what i know, provera will induce a period.  so you shouldn't take it anymore if you already have your period.

9P26sacKaa	I'm a doula through CAPPA in the US.

It's a good idea to read over the requirements of each and also the philosophies of each organization.<br>  <br>  The requirements are generally the same, with some being a little harder than others.  DONA is probably the most recognized doula association and is listed in many prenatal books mothers pick up, as well as being seen on news bulletins and web sites all over the place.  The other organizations are very good, however, and it would be worth checking them all out before making a decision.<br>  <br>  You usually have to read a number of required books, attend a workshop/training, audit a childbirth class, and attend a number of births.  Some organizations require more than that, but this is the basic requirement set.  You have to attend 3-5 births as a doula and get evaluations for each birth from a parent, nurse, and the doctor/midwife.  You can join the Yahoo groups for some of these organizations and ask questions there.  This will help you with tips on getting your births, where to find the reading without paying full price, etc.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|rfMEsSVqaa	Check the website for DONA International--<a href="http://www.dona.org/." rel="nofollow">http://www.dona.org/.</a>  They train and certify doulas all over the world.

I guess we are in the same boat, just waiting... I hope its our month!! Good luck and tons of baby dust!!!! xxxx|`|rKCpkBfmaa	It's hard, i know, but it's better to not think about symptoms. When you think about them - you automatically look for them at yours!!! Sometimes when you want to feel something - you eventually do, but it's not real, it's not reliable :)<br>  <br>  5DPO it's definately tooooo early to feel anything because your body doesn't even 'know' yet you may be pregnant. It all depends on pregnancy hormones level, but they (hormones) are not working yet!! (if you've conceived).<br>  Everything needs time and we can't help it. :)<br>  Good luck and fingers crossed!!|`|bIbhGAsCaa	You could be visit <a href="http://www.mybabyandfamily.co.uk/html/am_i_pregnant__pregnancy_sympt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mybabyandfamily.co.uk/html/am...</a>  they have a list of pregnancy symptoms. See if that helps|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	i don't knw if that is true but i am kinda in the same spot you are. my last af was 2/11/09-2/17/09. ovulated 2/18/09-2/24/09. and i am having sore boobs as if they are gettting gabbed with a knive, bad head aches and tis is tmi sorry but i have been vomunatting since about 1 yesterday morning. best of luck to the both of us.|`|NaJPIOheaa	Hey dear... if you go by the "books", usually they say it is far to early for signs, but in all honesty, i started getting sore breasts fairly early, and i'm going to take a guess that itchy boobs may be a sign, because if your breasts are growing, your skin stretches out, causing it to be itchy? As far as implantation i've heard as early as 4 days after ovulation... but i guess 3 days could be accurate too, it just depends on how long the egg takes to get to the uterus! Good luck & tons of baby dust xo
wqAaWKi0aa	Girl!   The only Addison I know is Addison Shepard : )|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	Girly name for a boy|`|FL67UPPHaa	It's a boy's name (all names ending in -son are male names, because they mean son of) which is mistakenly and far too commonly used on girls. Kudos to your friend for using it on the right gender!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I know traditionally it was a boys name but I think of a girl when I hear it.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Girl.|`|wdXQaATDaa	I think it's a GIRL name!!|`|MdSU0s8Saa	i think of a girl because it sounds like maddison|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I picture a boy.Because it means adams son which meant it was originally a boys name.|`|192VzAFGaa	Girl. <br>  <br>  Too me, it's not that masculine.

I don't particularly like it on either gender.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I think of a girl (maybe because I watch grey's anatomy and private practice!) but I know it means "son of Adam"|`|ValLVBcYaa	It's actually a boys name, I think.<br>  But I would think of a girl when I see it.|`|3lxagSP7aa	its unisex but i would only call girl it|`|5587e6858af0815b60a2d4300d0ae64aaa	Both.|`|4vdINuv6aa	I would think a girl..|`|AA11925334	GIRL|`|O5nCKpwcaa	Girl|`|vEHMarfgaa	girl <br>  addie|`|AcxMUPdsaa	I'm going to to say GIRL!!!|`|waA0uBXdaa	girl!
wkd5CMNaaa	They are required to give you the 12 weeks as stated by FMLA but that is it. <br>  There are no laws stating an employer must pay an employee for their leave.  Look into short term disability, you may be able to get 60% of your paycheck (untaxed) for 6 weeks.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	According to this, in CT your employer is not required to offer disability benefits, which maternity would fall under. If you don't have disability benefits, the employer would not be obligated to pay you for your time out.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.laborlawtalk.com/showthread.php?t=163453" rel="nofollow">http://www.laborlawtalk.com/showthread.p...</a>|`|rh5HjBJbaa	Don't know about Connecticut, but I know Maryland doesn't. You have to use all your sick time, short-term disability, or some other arrangement that your employer has. If there is an HR person at your company, give them a call. They should be able to talk all that over with you.|`|B1VVlLfBaa	Each state may vary. During this recent time of cutbacks states are no different than a normal household. They look for ways to NOT pay while still adhering to the law. So some while they may offer leave during this time WILL NOT offer paid leave. Also it may depend on the doctor and your relationship with the company. Some would rather pay and keep a great worker than not a loss someone and pay the cost of training someone else.

637d5kQZaa	I know it is very tough to be sleep deprived but if you are really at wits end you need to let him cry it out!  I was told by my pediatrician when my son was 10 months old that it was ok to let him cry for 45 minutes in his crib as long as he didn't know how to get out.  I would put video monitors in his room so you can check on him to make sure he is ok without letting him know you are watching.  If there isn't one already put a night light in his room or let him sleep with a glow buddy, from any target or walmart.  He might be having bad dreams but he needs to be able to self soothe so you both can be rested.  If after a week he is still waking up then there is something else causing him to wake up.  <br>  I forgot to mention that he might be teething.  Can you give him medicine before bed to make sure pain isn't causing him to wake up?!<br>  I hope this helps and good luck.|`|AA11622101	I went through something similar with both my kids, so I know how hard it is.  I tried everything, read every sleep book , but eventually I just had to let them both cry.  I know it is hard but I honestly believe it is the only way.  This is what I did: <br>  <br>  Get a routine going.  Do the same thing every night, starting at about 6:15-6:30; in our case my kids had a bath, had a little snack, brushed their teeth, read a story and then it was time for bed. Put him to bed at about 7:30-7:45.  He will probably start to cry.  Let him cry for 10 minutes.  Do not go in before that.  When you go into his room, do not pick him up or coddle him.  Just say a little sternly, "It is time for night-night", or something to that effect, pat him on the back for a second and then leave.  Let him cry for 15 minutes.  Do the same thing if needed.  Just keep going in every 15 minutes and tell him it is time for sleep.  But do not pick him up and take him downstairs or offer him food.   He will think it is awake time and will keep getting up.  I made that mistake and my son used to get up at 4 am every day and not go back to sleep.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!  I know it is so hard to hear him cry but you need to be strong so you and your baby can get some rest!!
wQajkvkTaa	my sister was exactly the same as you. but she waited until she saw her child, before she decided. she named her chloe alice in the end. which wasnt any of the names she had written down. she loved this name, and she thought that it matched her babys face, and personality. i dont think you can decide before seeing the child.|`|jb4YWxvqaa	I find that most ppl decided on names they like based on a person (celebrity, ancestor, etc etc) they like who has that name.<br>  <br>  I think that if you start from 'what kinda person' you hope your child will be, you'll find names that you really like. And try not to reflect on an existing person you know. For instance, 'Robin Hood' did bad bad things, and you don't want your son to be named Robin because of that. However the name 'Robin' could mean something wonderful.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah and don't forget about matching the first name with the last name. If the last name have only 1 syllable, it's always good to have first name with more than 1 syllable. <br>  <br>  If the last name indeed has only 1 syllable and you like a 1 syllable first name, just make sure that the first letter of the first name is different from the first letter of the last name.<br>  <br>  It's just my twocents.|`|u5DmS32baa	I know how you feel. I read the "boy" section of a book like 7-10 times before I finally caught attention to the one name I liked.<br>  <br>  You might not like it for you...but I named my son Tanner.<br>  <br>  A little while ago I heard the name Cohen which I thought was nice and different...<br>  <br>  And recently I've been watching the Young and the Restless and just think Kane is so hot!!!

215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	Everyone does things very differently so the must-haves for each person vary. I can tell you that putting anything and everything you think you could possibly want or need on your registry is a good idea. I had a huge registry, my husband and I just went through the store scanning things that we liked. We got tons of compliments from the guests of our baby shower about our registry, they said it was large so there were plenty of options for every to buy something no matter what their budget. A lot of my family members pool their money and buy the big things on the registry ie, car seats, stroller, rocking chair, bouncer, swing, pack-n-play, bassinet, breast pump and the others that are buying gifts themselves can buy the smaller things like blankets, diapers, thermometer, baby bath items, clothes. To people looking at your registry having lots of options doesn't make you look greedy it makes you look like you want to be prepared! Good luck!|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	For me, I registered for some bottles even though I planned on nursing, I suggest the playtex nursers, they are great and the only ones my son would take while nursing. Plenty of burp rags, all different types of pacifiers, (you never know what your baby will like I tries 3 different kinds before I found what he would like ) a HUGE bottle of gas drops (always a must and I forgot to get them with both my kids lol) I wouldn't recommend registering for a whole lot of blankets, i had tons with both my kids and never used half of them. I had good luck with bouncers and swings with both of my kids- If you chose that I recommend a bouncer with a vibrating seat and a swing the goes in 2 directions. and also a good sling, I bought the infantino one from target and hated it. So I recommend the wrap ones. Geez I'm going on an on and on! Good luck!|`|heDtLdz5aa	a baby bathtub...wash clothes...baby towels..lots of burp clothes...onsies...socks...diapers diaper cream...baby care kit(brush, nail filer, nail clippers, the nose sucky things..sorry forget the correct word..LOL..).diaper genie.. baby lotion..baby wash...thermometer..|`|iKYNUni0aa	<a href="http://www.modernmom.com/pregnancy_parenting/article/663" rel="nofollow">http://www.modernmom.com/pregnancy_paren...</a>|`|qicxk5GMaa	Target actually has a list of must haves.  I registered for most of the things on their list but I do not plan on using a changing table, bottle warmers, wipe warmer, or diaper genie.  The necessities I think are crib, car seat (infant and convertable), stroller, I plan to breastfeed as well but registered for a pack of bottles anyway, diaper bag, dresser or plastic drawer tower thing, toy box or laundry basket to store toys, crib sheets, recieving blankets, and clothes.  People will pretty much buy clothes, toys, books, diapers and wipes but you can register for them anyway just to be safe.  I also registered for a high chair, swing, bouncy seat and activity center walker thing.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	Everyone will tell you different but in my family:<br>  1) We buy a lot of onesies! Cute outfits are great and I would always have at least two around, but if you aren't going out a lot you probably will only keep your baby in onesies. Other problems with the cute outfits: Babies get them dirty and ruin them and if they don't they grow out of them too fast. <br>  2) Different types of pacifiers! My aunt got a million but they were all the same kind. Her baby wouldn't take them so we went and bought one of each package and there was only one type her baby would suck on. <br>  3) Those kangaroo or something other seats. They are some soft material, small seat. It holds the baby up and is easy to travel with. It's really nice as restaurants because the baby can sit up on the table with the family and you don't have to carry a giant carrier around. <br>  4)  I would ask for gift cards more than anything, but you really don't know what you need until you have your own baby.|`|CjySz62Haa	a lot of bodysuits <br>  diapers<br>  gas drops<br>  baby wipes ( non alcohol)<br>  receiving blankets<br>  nipple cream<br>  maybe nipple shields<br>  breastmilk storage bags<br>  breast pump<br>  nursing bras and pads<br>  <br>  and finally, a lot of patience and energy, sleep while you can, do whatever, go wherever, keep yourself entertained, you won't have it all soon:) good luck<br>  <br>  mom of 3 month old|`|2LmfQUbKaa	lol! ya i understood it! congrats! well the things you will need the most!<br>  PAMPERS! whips onezies towels rags lotion shampoo cream for bottom just in case of rash! bottles nipples! oh my goodness nipples! socks plenty of clothes they mess them like crazy! bibs! you can never have enough bibs! blankets you know the thin ones but most of all at first bibs bottles milk cereal and pampers whip es plenty of the last two! good luck dont forget the crib sheets if they sleep in crib plenty of those and padding to go around you can ask for a bouncy chair thats great! a holder that you strap onto you! baby grooming items|`|1elv7oc5aa	Well, even though you plan to breast feed, most likely you will want some bottles and breast pump, diapers, wipes, onesies, blankets, clothes, bath, bath stuff, monitor, nail clippers, spit up rags (lots), bouncer, some kind of soft musical toy, and a whole lot more.  That is all that I can think of off the top of my head.  It's been 7 years since my youngest was a baby.  Congratulations and good luck to you.|`|a402885910549caddf0eb474b891f438aa	Lots of receiving blankets, onesies, pj's, socks and hand mittens so he/she doesnt scratch his/her face. And lots of diapers and wipes.. Those are the basics for the first few months. Good luck!!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	a 'travel' swing. the seats are more 'cushiony' and they sit lower to the ground than a regular swing so they are better to use the first few months. it was the only way i was able to get both my kids to sleep most of the time. also some kind of wrap or carrier to keep the baby on you when you need to be hands free and get stuff done.|`|9ff653285dcca235b469d9b2b3442377aa	First off....Congratulations!<br>  <br>  I found with my first baby I got a lot MORE then what I really needed.  You know the basics with the carseat, stroller, crib and changing table.<br>  <br>  I found that bottles are nice to have, even if you plan on nursing...keep them around in case things don't go as planned.   Onesies are nice to have lots of, less laundry in the long run.  And several outfits in case your little one spits up a lot or leaks through.  Crib sheets and diaper changing pad covers were nice to have a few of, as well.  But really, its diapers and wipes that will kill your budget.<br>  <br>  My Husband and I got away without a diaper genie...you have to buy refills.  We hated the baby monitor, made us paranoid with every squeek or grunt the little one makes.  We liked the idea of a wipe warmer, but it only warmed the top sheets and the rest were cold, it finally started to over heat and we tossed it.  You don't really need a bottle warmer, I found a pan on the stove or the microwave for heating water worked better then they did.   <br>  <br>  Keep it simple, sometimes those things that you think will save you time or energy aren't really worth it.  Besides you'll have your hands full.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes!!|`|AzqAZhWpaa	I love my boppy for breastfeeding, especially in the first few weeks when they are so small.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Ok, breast pump, bottles, blankets, clothes, bottle scrubber, a baby bath, lotion, baby wash, a boppy I was so glad for especially when I was breastfeeing, diaper bag more then I would suggest, wipes,diapers, bibs, burp clothes. That is all that I can think of at the moment.|`|veMA1a6paa	I would agree with the first person who answered but if you are planning on breast feeding, I would add breast pump and breast pads to that list.

fWAzJIEkaa	No, at 2 weeks a "primitive streak" appears. It will later develop into the fetus' central nervous system. This is the point at which spontaneous division of the blastocyst -- an event that sometimes generates identical twins -- is not longer possible. The pre-embryo is now referred to as an embryo. It is a very small blob of undifferentiated tissue at this stage of development. <br>  Its not until 10 weeks the embryo is now called a fetus.

Congrats on your pregnancy!|`|vlCWp7sSaa	When the egg is first fertilized, its called an embryo. It takes 8-12weeks for it to become a fetus. It will be the size of a kidney bean.

Y!A is not a pool of professionally trained counselors.  You need professional help if you feel suicidal.  You can voluntarily commit yourself and that's what I'd recommend if you feel like this.

Good luck :]|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Well, I hate to rain on your parade, but you should know that some chemicals are absorbed through the skin, and if I were you, I'd get a list of the ingredients and check them out with your doctor before you do this.  Better safe than sorry.  tans are fun, but what would really be unfun, is saying to yourself that your baby died or had complications because you wanted a tan.  THAT would suck.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	It would be perfectly safe!  Maybe you could find a place that does air brush tans.  That way you won't have to worry about being to close to the sprayers.  You would be able to have an air brush tech make sure the tan comes out nice and even!<br>  <br>  If you can't find anyone to do the air brush tan, the go ahead and get a mystic...If it turns out bad, just remember they are only temporary!|`|IoWoDxG8aa	yes i think so!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	I would check with your doctor, I heard that you can. But check with your ob.<br>  <br>  The Mystic Tan? system does not expose you to any form of radiation so, from that aspect, it is safe. As I understand it, the system actually sprays a bronzing liquid on you. It is a sunless tanning solution similar to the sunless lotion sold in stores. If there are any safety concerns related to the solution, I would expect the salon to require you to read and sign a release. If they do have one, I would advise you to read it carefully to see if it has any statements related to this procedure while pregnant.|`|zBz10IiOaa	hmm i don't think they recomend it hun but i,m not too sure<br>  might want to call and ask doesn't hurt to try|`|AA12395149	It is not known whether spray on tans can be harmful to your baby and your health.

sK67bBy5aa	haha!! The answer before me must not know what  13 DPO is hahaha! I would try a first response. The CBD is 50 MUI and the First Response is 20 MUI. For my first one I didn't find out until I was 6 weeks pregnant. So good luck!|`|EqxxXrvLaa	Your 13! You can't get your license, get an apartment, or even legally get a job.  If your with a guy who is at least 3 years older than you, it's illegal for you two to be together. If he is your age then how do you plan to raise this child in a functional home? Your a baby yourself. Stop trying to have a baby.<br>   I spend: $100.00 a month in diapers $20.00 wipes, $200.00 in food. Not to mention Clothes, bath supplies, medicine, shoes, car seat (I just bought my son one that was $200.00).<br>    It is VERY  VERY expensive!|`|WdvLcYaVaa	I'm sorry hun! I have heard that CBD aren't as sensitive as some other tests. maybe try first response early result tomorrow. Its not completely over till AF shows! Good luck!
1alUsemJaa	If this is ur first pregnancy, you can never be too safe, I'd say call the doc right away don't wait, ask her opinion, she may say its no big deal and she'll look you over at ur appointment or you may need medical attention straight away, but yes it is better to be safe than sorry, best of luck! and Congratulations!|`|p27OVzwPaa	You'd better let your Doctor know A.S.A.P! I am not sure what this could be, cuz, as u can c from my avatar, I'm a guy, but...U shud definitely let ur Doc. know.<br>  Good Luck with you child.|`|YrQNKKpVaa	You should really tell the doctor because they may be able to tell you what is going on. For all you know something can be going wrong with the pregnancy (hopefully not though).|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I wouldn't go to the doctor today just because of this. Sounds like mild contractions to me. I've been having braxton hicks and backaches, but only 1-2 times a day for about a minute. I would just say something about it next time you go.|`|JITTMjasaa	No that's not normal. Call your Dr. if she says to wait till Tues. tell her then. Stay away from caffeine even decaf or chocolate. Try not to eat too much sugar and drink plenty of water. Also, don't overdo it, ie get plenty of rest and don't strain or do too much activity. Eat as much healthy food as you want. Sometimes your body will crave whatever it is lacking.|`|Zew5sfbyaa	you may want to check your temp, the dizzy could be from your blood pressure being low. Which I was told isn't a big concern unless you get too dizzy and fall or faint. I would for sure call your dr and see what he suggests. Good Luck|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I would call your Dr now to be safe.  If you have already been to the hospital for contractions once.....better safe then sorry.|`|DAH48qSOaa	just go to the doctor, but the back pain is normal for pregnancy|`|AA12395149	As long as the contractions are not regular, then you should be fine.  If the back pain is just a persistent ache, you can take tylenol for it or use or moist heat or cooling to soothe it.  However, if the pain in your back is coming in waves, they may be contractions and you may need to go back to the hospital or speak with your doctor.<br>  <br>  The dizziness and warmth are normal.  Try not to change positions quickly (especially lying to standing, you may faint).  Going to the bathroom constantly may just be that the baby's head is pushing on the bladder.  However, if you're having pain or burning with peeing, or if it feels like you're not completely emptying your bladder, you may have an infection and may need to be treated.  If the pain in your back is more mid back and close to the spine, it may be your kidneys indicating even more so that you need to be checked out for a possible urinary tract infection.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.
heC9aQ18aa	I have recently come to like this name. It's uncommon, pretty, fresh. Will age well with the child.<br>  I have never met an Isla but I have heard of the actress by that name and she's fine.<br>  I don't think it would be hard to pronounce anywhere. You tell them how to pronounce it if they don't and there should be no problem. They aren't all idiots in North America (I am here in N.America so no thumbs down please or hate email).<br>  I think of Isla as artsy, dresses<br>   vintage, reddish blonde hair, average height, slim. <br>  I like it spelled Isla as it should be spelled.|`|G5Wsaa63aa	I think Isla sounds beautiful but yes the pronunciation will have to be corrected a fair amount in the US, but I don't think it's that big a deal.<br>  <br>  I definitely prefer the spelling Isla, and I imagine a quiet, delight, but gorgeous woman when I hear the name.|`|KmC0K59taa	I do like it.

Ccq8zEcnaa	I've read nipple stimulation for an hour to two a day can really bring on some strong contractions and lead to labor. Also rubbing your achilles tendon in your ankles (the back of you ankle above your heel) and squats on birthing balls.|`|tX27e0UFaa	You should walk as much, do as much activity as you can stand and also I heard drinking caster oil will work and it will not harm the baby. You will have something coming out of you if you drink that!|`|f9lZK2aKaa	Walking is great exercise. Try squatting and using a "birthing ball".

9P26sacKaa	Because some doctors don't care about the risks to moms and babies and are probably hoping they'll end up with a c-section and get a lot more money anyhow.<br>  <br>  In all seriousness, some doctors really do not care about the risks or telling the mom about the risks.  In other cases it may be because the mother is already dilating and effacing and thus a better candidate for induction.  Some doctors induce anyone they can, again not regarding all the risks of induction.  So it matters more how your doctor cares about adding risks unnecessarily.<br>  <br>  There are definitely a lot of risks to induction, especially if your cervix is not ready yet (which might also have something to do with which of your friends were induced on request and which ones weren't).<br>  <br>  Some women are pressured into it by their doctors.  In this case she officially requested it, even if she wouldn't have really wanted it if her doctor hadn't pushed for it or if she had known all of the risks.  The mom might tell everyone that she wanted to be induced for xyz reasons, but they were pushed on her by her doctor and weren't really good reasons for induction in the first place.<br>  <br>  I personally feel that induction-happy doctors are bad doctors and do not have anything but their pocketbooks as a priority.  After all, you can't put women and babies at so many greater risks, without reason, and feel no remorse about it unless you're not a good doctor to begin with.  That's just my personal feeling about it.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: high blood pressure combined with protein in your urine really is a true medical reason for induction.  If your urine is clean, however, and your blood pressure is controllable, then you don't have pre-eclampsia and don't need to be induced (for pre-eclampsia).  If you have any additional signs of pre-eclampsia, however, it's worth a quick call to your doctor.  These include sudden swelling, blurry vision, migraines, seeing spots (that weren't there before), and other symptoms I'm sure they told you about.|`|CpiLHcTlaa	well it depends on the doctors and usually they do have some sort of reason to. like they look like they're ready to go into labor, your not dealing with being pregnant very well. sometimes its just simple reasons. honestly its better to go naturally being induced brings on more painful contractions. it all depends on what the doctors comfortable with doing and what they think the patient can deal with.|`|64OsCr8laa	no its not fair my aunt is being induce monday night(tuesday morning) she asked to be the doctor first said we dont do that unless we have to but then after reviewing her file she said yes we will<br>  <br>  so im not use about how her case would be taken she is 39 weeks and not dilated or anything she has not done anything at all!!! so i think that is why the doctor went ahead and decided for her to be induced<br>  <br>  but really no its not fair at all that some has the choice|`|lzUF22l0aa	it depends on the doctor i just got in a fight with mine today they wont induce before 41 weeks and i read a whole article last night how people request it at 39 weeks and their drs induce them so unfair i agree with you 100%|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Because every Dr has a different view on things.  Many argue that inductions should only occur when really needed.  Other's don't feel that way. <br>  Have you done your research on induction?  Voluntary inductions can cause some serious problems.  Your baby will come when he/she is done baking in there.|`|JITTMjasaa	It is best for you and the baby to let it happen naturally. Some doctors understand this and some don't care as long as there getting paid. Stupid mother f***ing jack**s quacks.|`|4p9sBdyTaa	It is actually just a doctors choice. Some still believe in waiting for baby.|`|Zew5sfbyaa	it is a dr thing, my sis told her dr she was tired of being preggo and he induced her at 37 weeks.|`|IV7iBNjTaa	well i asked to be induced bec my hub bin is in the navy and he live to go out to sec so i whit him here to see are FIRST baby i well be 40 week win it all go done|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	It depends a lot on the doctor. Some find that inducing is too risky and ends in C-section too often. Some think the risk is warranted. It's all about the doctors experience and preferances.<br>  <br>  Personally, I have known too many people who have been induced and had horrible labors, one of which ended with a rutpured uterus and a very badly disabled baby. So I wouldn't be too keen on the idea of being induced, either, unless it was truly necessary.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Your difference there is good dr's and bad dr's.  A good dr wouldn't worry about the patience's wants if it could jeopardize the baby.  It is always best for the baby to stay in the womb as long as it naturally can unless there is health concerns.  The longer the baby stays in the womb the better!
nrqWwQBXaa	if they were in the family. i only let my family watch my kids?|`|hKJIDdVqaa	No, I would not. A 13 lacks judgment and responsibility no matter what they claim to know. My 10 year old is a high honor student, extremely mature, and responsible. However he still does the most silly, childish, sometimes dangerous things.  I just could not feel comfortable in a situation of a 13 being in charge of my child.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	It would depend on the age of the child(ren) they were sitting for.  Definitely wouldn't let them watch a very small baby for any great length of time (not more than 2 or 3 hours) and I definitely wouldn't let them sit with my 13 year old son.  I do think that they would be perfect for a toddler to first grader though.|`|AA11210211	Possibly,I would really have to know them,I started babysitting when I was 12 yrs but I was a very mature 12 yr old though and I LOVE children.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Not a chance. Two teen girls together are prone to interacting with each other more than the kids. The only way I'd have two babysitters at once is if a girl brought her mom along to help.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Only if they were family friends or close neighbors.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	no, too young in my opinion..|`|n3IoftMFaa	It depends on the age of my children and the references of the girls.<br>  <br>  A good way to show you are responsible and not just there to hang out - is to have activities planned. Bring some arts and crafts stuff - make fun stuff, bring a board game, etc...You can even say that you know people will think you are all about talking to your friend and ignoring the kids but tell them you guys really want a chance. Also, have your mom come by - I would feel a lot better about the whole thing if a mom came by.<br>  <br>  You could build up trust by offering to be an "errand babysitter". If mom needs to go out quick, for shopping or whatever - you be willing and happy to just watch the kids for the hour she is gone. Then, she'll start to trust you if the kids are happy and everything is OK.|`|J2glFOkhaa	It depends, I know some 18 year olds who I wouldn't let near my child. It has nothing to do with age, but with responsibility. I personally don't know any 13 year old who I would trust, but I do know a couple of 15 year olds. <br>  <br>  It depends on how you feel about them. Are they responsible? Are they smart enough to think quickly on their toes? Thigns can happen fast, they need to know how to react<br>  <br>  When I was 14 I was with my friend, she was babysitting. She was CPR trained, first aid certified, all that goo stuff. <br>  <br>  The baby started choking on its own vomit, my friend FREAKED OUT, and froze. I had to help the baby, thank goodness I was there. <br>  <br>  See what I mean though, they have to be smart, and responsible. I'd be sure you get to know them very well.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I would really have to meet you to know for sure but probably not. You're just a little too young and I honestly would prefer someone who could drive, just in case. <br>  <br>  I did start babysitting my nephew right after he was born when I was 13 (just about to turn 14) but that was just for a few hours at first, after I had watched him with family being home, and it was only because I was family. I watched him full-time over the summer when I was 14 and, again, it was only because I was family. <br>  <br>  I would possibly let you stay with my kids for an hour or two but I doubt it. Unless you were family or I knew you and your family extremelly well I would just feel uncomfortable leaving you alone with my kids. I'd just have to meet you though. I have family that would watch my kids if necessary and I'd rather leave them with family than a couple of teenagers. Sorry hun. You'll get plenty of babysitting jobs when you're older I'm sure if you are what you say you are.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	no way. a 13 year old is not a 38 year old trapped in a teen body...whoever said that is crazy.<br>  <br>  there is no way...maybe a few more years down the road.<br>  <br>  i was always mature for my age and i took a babysitting class at 13 and got my license and you know what...i felt so overwhelmed and if i were in a situation where the child i was babysitting was choking...deep down i would have panicked and not have known what to do...<br>  <br>  13 is just way too young. when i have my child i'm not even leaving him/her with anyone BUT mature, adult family for the first year or so.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Maybe one, never two.<br>  Two of you together would just be you hanging out. I had five 13 y/os and I was one. I know how it works.|`|a8IRxC4raa	No, but I would hire them as Mother's Helpers.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|LU96bnCdaa	yeah!<br>  i think if u were first aid & CPR certified, and u are really mature...y not?<br>  =]|`|0mbGkwFJaa	Honestly, no I wouldnt. Theres only a certain amount of experience you can have at the age of 13, and there is a lot more to caring for children than knowing how to change a nappy etc and I wouldnt hire anyone of any age unless they had a childcare qualification. (Only exception being a close friend and family member who had experience with children.)|`|L1XVydDxaa	depends on how old the child is if it is an infant them absolutely not but if the child is 4 or older maybe but i would check into how real all the certified stuff that they have!|`|842e6473a8bb1a5aebd67febd13abe6daa	No way.<br>  <br>  Especially if BOTH of you wanted to babysit. You two would just be "having fun", not watching my child. <br>  <br>  Plus, to me, 13 years old is a liiittle bit too young - unless you were a relative or something of the like.|`|QRpB5pFXaa	how old are the children theyre babysitting? are they guys or girls? and for how long?<br>  <br>  typically the way 13 year olds are nowadays, no. these kids may be an exception to the rule...but i would be leary|`|zaFH8JrVaa	heck yea!<br>  well put in yr additional details: what if we went to a babysitting camp and got certificates and was very mature?"<br>  pshhhh i shur would let yu and me babysit(:|`|IWzYB44raa	It depends on how well I knew them.  I have had some kids babysit that I thought were great that turned out to be just awful and an accident happened.|`|oEtl16sJaa	hmm, not two and only if i knew them well enough, like close a family friend.|`|ZLjeDe7xaa	Yes, as long as that trapped 38-year-old is not a pedophile.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Never.<br>  I would alow one, but only if they were a family friend or relative.|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	nope
SEzIkGNiaa	I would start by handing out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children.  If you don't you could just ask people if they know anyone that needs a sitter.  Eventually the word will get around that you babysit.  <br>  But if you want to put the flyers in peoples mail boxes, I suggest meeting with the family or set up an interview before agreeing to babysit alone.  Also get your parents to meet the kids parents.<br>  <br>  =]|`|n3IoftMFaa	A good way to avoid this and feel safer is to say "I'm a great sitter, blah, blah AND my mom will be popping by to see how things are going throughout the night."<br>  <br>  It is VERY unlikely you'll get killed this way. It would be too easy to catch - they know where you were.|`|28QPS6V9aa	ha ha ha, you "kinda don't want to be murdered" lol, well why not. :) ha ha, that was cute! Anyways, even murderers can live in a nice neighborhood!  I recommend only babysitting for people you know. When I was your age I got a lot of babysitting jobs from people at my church. If you go to a church you can make a nice flyer and put it on a bulletin board there.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	I don't think it matters. <br>  Sick people live everywhere. Go hand out flyers, and if anyone calls to ask you to babysit, tell them you would like to meet them first, and bring your parents along.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes he can really get enough in 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't try to force a breastfed baby to go longer than 2 hours.   It only takes a maximum of 90 minutes for breastmilk to digest.  Also many moms will not make enough milk only nursing every 3-4 hours.  Breastfeeding works the way it does for a reason, its to ensure that babies get enough interaction and contact, not just food.  Its also to make sure that mommy rests enough to support lactation.  Humans can have pregnancies much closer together because human lactation is much more efficient so it doesn't take as much calories, fat, etc out of mom.  One way it does that is by making her body digest and utilize nutrients more efficiently, the other way is by making her rest more and in theory get support from other women.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#breastfeedingpatterns" rel="nofollow">http://mother-2-mother.com/normal.htm#br...</a><br>  Some mothers become concerned if baby begins to nurse in very short sessions. Most breastfeeding experts advise that if the baby continues to have plenty of wet diapers, regular bowel movements, is gaining weight well and meeting developmental milestones, then baby is getting enough breastmilk. Even sessions as short as five minutes can be normal, as long as baby continues to grow and do well.<br>  <br>  And from personal experience short nursing sessions are a blessing.  There is nothing that can't wait 5 minutes, but if you have a baby that nurses for 20-40 minutes it can be a major problem, particularly if you have other kids or have to go somewhere.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepthrough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...</a><br>  Human children are designed (whether you believe by millions of years of evolution, or by God, it doesn't matter) -- to nurse *very* frequently, based on the composition of the milk of the species, the fact that all higher primates (Primates are the zoological Order to which humans belong, higher primates include monkeys and apes) keep their offspring in the mother's arms or on her back for several years, the size of the young child's stomach, the rapidity with which breast milk is digested, the need for an almost constant source of nutrients to grow that huge brain (in humans, especially), and so on. By very frequently, I mean 3-4 times per hour, for a few minutes each time. The way in which some young infants are fed in our culture -- trying to get them to shift to a 3-4 hour schedule, with feedings of 15-20 minutes at a time, goes against our basic physiology. But humans are very adaptable, and some mothers will be able to make sufficient milk with this very infrequent stimulation and draining of the breasts, and some children will be able to adapt to large meals spaced far apart. Unfortunately, some mothers don't make enough milk with this little nursing, and some babies can't adjust, and so are fussy, cry a lot, seem to want to nurse "before it is time" and fail to grow and thrive. Of course, usually the mother's body is blamed -- "You can't make enough milk" -- rather than the culturally-imposed expectation that feeding every 3-4 hours should be sufficient, and the mother begins supplementing with formula, which leads to a steady spiral downward to complete weaning from the breast.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/scheduling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/sche...</a><br>  You're important, not only to yourself but to others.  You have important things to do.  Many of those things are scheduled.  You're picking your mother up at the airport Tuesday at 3:00.  You have an office appointment Thursday at 10:00.  Your workday has a definite beginning and end.  So does your partner's.  That means it works best to have the day's major events scheduled. <br>  <br>       Now imagine that, on top of all that, you also need to schedule your bathroom breaks.  You need to train yourself to use the bathroom every 2 1/2 hours.  No running to the bathroom between times, no skipping a bathroom break because you don't feel the need.  Every 2 1/2 hours.  On the dot.<br>  <br>       What?  No time among the important events in your day for that kind of rigid scheduling of a trivial event?  Of course not!  Our day runs most smoothly when it's organized around the major events, with minor events fitting in on a fluid basis, not when it's organized around the minor events. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  At first, nursing a baby is time-consuming and all-consuming.  You feel as if your whole day revolves around feeding the baby, and it sounds good to think that you could schedule this major event and somehow get some control over it.  Scheduling sounds like a sanity-saver. <br>  <br>       But once you learn how to hold a baby easily for nursing, once the baby learns to latch on quickly, once the early weeks are past, feeding just isn't a major event. You can nurse while you cook, while you watch tv, or eat, or write, or walk, or sleep.  If your baby is given the chance to snack as he sees the need, he's never really hungry, and you can "top him off" because you want to do something else, rather than because he's asked, stretching the next nursing interval as a result.  Or you can stall him for a bit while you finish an activity.  Or you can take a quick break from that activity, nurse for just a couple minutes, and leave him full enough to wait a bit longer. <br>  <br>       This kind of free-wheeling approach of frequent, short, flexible nursings leaves your day free to structure itself around other activities.  When feeding the baby is an incidental activity, like snuggling him, everyone's day usually runs more smoothly, including the baby's... and yours.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.todaysparent.com/article.jsp?content=1266685" rel="nofollow">http://www.todaysparent.com/article.jsp?...</a><br>   Wiessinger believes that counting and timing feedings may only make a nursing mother feel more stressed about what she thinks she needs to accomplish during the day. The reality, however, might actually be quite different since, as Wiessinger points out, frequent feedings tend to be short and easy to fit around other activities.<br>  <br>  Anthropologist Kathy Dettwyler from Texas A&M University says that nursing a lot is typical of babies around the world. She cites a study done in 2000 that looked at the feeding behaviour of infants aged three to four months in three different communities: families from Washington, DC, the Ba’Aka hunter-gatherers and the Ngandu farmers, both of the Central African Republic. They found that the Ba’Aka babies nursed 4.02 times per hour, the Ngandu babies nursed 2.01 times per hour and the American babies nursed 1.6 times per hour. Certainly the American babies nursed less often than the two African groups, but they nursed more frequently than many new parents expect. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/hungry.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.normalfed.com/Continuing/hung...</a><br>  How many times did you eat or drink something today?  Coffee break?  Water fountain?  Gum?  Snack?  TV nibblies?  Most adults have an urge to eat about every 90 minutes while they're awake!<br>  <br>      Why do you eat or drink?  Hunger?  Thirst?  Comfort?  For social reasons?  Just because?<br>  <br>      Are you trying to gain weight?  If you had to double your weight in 6 months, how would you do it?  Would you drink water?  Chew sugarless gum between meals?  Eat large meals at long intervals?  Or would you do lots and lots of snacking, day and night?<br>  <br>      When it comes to food, babies are people, too.  They're people plus, because they are trying to double their weight in about half a year, with a stomach that starts out no bigger than a golf ball.  Of course they eat and eat and eat, especially in the early weeks.  If your newborn is gaining about half a pound a week, he's doing well.  If not, a breastfeeding specialist can help you find ways to help him nurse more effectively.  Remember, if milk doesn't go in often, pounds can't go on fast.|`|8WRnqs08aa	He's gaining weight & wetting diapers, so it sounds like he's getting enough! Your breast milk must come out in "Super Release Mode".... lol<br>  <br>  If you're still worried, ask his Dr. at the next appt.  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Grateful Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (Babies #5&6)|`|035f0c618509868724b99b045ce88d86aa	isnt that great? your baby just sucks down his meal so quickly and efficiently. so much quicker than bottle feeding. that is a nice perk to breastfeeding. my three kids  breastfed in the same manner. it is completely normal. your baby is a no nonsense eater.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Most babies that age have reduced how much time they need to nurse, but more to like 15-20 minutes.  Is he draining the breast you give him? If so, he might just be a super-nurser! encourage him to eat more by stroking his cheek and picking a calm, distraction-free place to feed. If he is falling asleep eating, take off some clothes or change his diaper.  Finishing a breast will get him the creamy hindmilk and help him go longer.<br>  <br>  If he wants to eat too soon, try giving him a pacifier, finger or toy to suck on. YOu never know, he may be ok with that.  Check to see if he is rooting as well as just fussing.  It is hard to tell when it is hunger, but if you try other solutions first you might find it is something else.  He will eat much better the next tme if he is actually hungry, too, or at least that is my experience with DD. 2 1/2-4 hours is pretty average for feeding spacing at this age, depending on baby.|`|0df8f5b1ddcfb2fb679e59ebec88e90baa	next time he fusses, try giving him a pacifier instead of your breast, he probably wants something to suck on or is just bored, and you don't really want him using your breast as a pacifier, it should be for feeding only. If he's really hungry he should be nursing for at least 15-20 mins, other than that kudos for BFing and keep up the good work!|`|Eh6MnODtaa	When my son was about that age, he also nursed about 5 minutes on each breast and I could feel that he emptied both. I am a first time mommy and I was concerned, my husband said he was strong enough to suck harder and more effective to finish eating. I know this may sound crazy but you could get a baby scale and measure him before feeeding and after for you to have a peace of mind. I think he should be able to go without feedings for about 3 hours by now. Maybe when he fusses try to play with him a little and not feed him right away. But you know your baby best, maybe he is hungry or going thru a growth spurt. Around 3, 4, 6 and 9 months you could expect them they say.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	keep doing what you are doing- it sound fine. don't ever force or try to make a bay space out their feedings- nursing often is good for your supply. my son nursed constantly for a while- once they become mobile then they nurse a lot less because they are too interested in other things and you'll be practically begging them to eat lol<br>  <br>   the older the baby gets the better they get at nursing so they tend to be quicker at nursing gwim?|`|X6as2nOAaa	Sometimes they just like that comfort, my daughter used to do the same thing. It is ok as long as he is gaining weight normally it is ok.

I don't want to hear people trash my names and  I don't want to get pressured to "honor" my MIL who is undeserving.  <br>  <br>  Everyone will find out the name eventually.  They can be patient for a few more months.   Just tell them you are undecided still if you don't want to come outright and say you're not sharing.  Prepare for a ton of suggestions, but just smile and nod.|`|86oPkfzOaa	No. Actually, I think it is better you don't tell family your baby names, because they might try and talk you out of it, or give you doubts.|`|OHfZFR31aa	No, you are being very smart. Do you really want to hear everyone's opinions? Do you want to have to justify the name or explain why you chose it over and over? <br>  <br>  Two of my coworkers are pregnant and neither will tell people at work the names they have picked out. One thinks it's a jinx to tell people before the birth, and the other told her mother in law, who hated the name, and decided she wasn't going to mention it to anyone else because she is already sure she is going to use the name.|`|heC9aQ18aa	Not unfair. It differs with every person. Some like to hear opinions and some don't.|`|OKarH9Zsaa	No, not at all, it is your baby.|`|hSJnaysiaa	God no! I highly recommend NOT telling people the name because everyone has an opinion (and they will think you care to hear it).<br>  <br>  I am pregnant with my first and didn't know how people would be so I told everyone the name when they asked. Well, its been nothing but an issue in my family ever since and I can't seem to hear the end of "he will get beaten up with a name like that" "we need to find him a suitable nickname" "he's going to hate you for naming him that". Its a perfectly good name though we think. Not common (like Michael or Alex) but not totally out there either.<br>  <br>  I'm pregnant though, and don't need or want the added stress at this point. <br>  <br>  My advice though is to just keep it to yourself until the baby is born.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Nope. I will do the same thing. I don't want anyone's opinion on the name I ACTUALLY plan to use for my child. I've had it picked out since before I MET my husband, and lucky (for him) he likes it too...That's gonna be it and I don't want to hear what they think of it! <br>  <br>  It's not selfish at all- it's just being protective of the name. Lets face it- people DO steal baby names! You're just fine.|`|OU9xnW86aa	I am doing the same thing. No, you are not being unfair. Don't let anyone make you feel bad for not disclosing your baby's name before the birth. I mostly don't want to share because 1. I don't want someone to steal my name and 2. I don't want to hear people tell me they don't like it.<br>  <br>  IT'S YOUR CHOICE AND DECISION!!!|`|UiNCOVaFaa	I think it's up to you if you want to share it.  They will know soon enoug what the name will be, and tney will know the name of the kid for the rest of his/her life.  I it's important to you, keep it to yourself.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	No you're not being selfish. I think sometimes other people are being selfish when they try to force their unsolicited opinions on you. By not disclosing names your avoiding those types of situations.|`|ValLVBcYaa	Of course not! It's great not to tell people. What's there for them to be excited about if they already know the sex and name of the baby?<br>  Keep them waiting!|`|FvYqKZSMaa	No.Just tell them it will be a surprise if its someone you know if not just say we are in the process of choosing a name.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	whether you tell them now or not there will still be opinions so in my opinion whats the point in teh secrecy? but its entirely your choice and they will just have to wait.|`|McR1OPxJaa	your not being selfish or unfair, when i told my family what i wanted to name my daughter i got mixed signals, and mother in law, was like well how about this name, and was just listing a bunch of names, and i'm like no, this is the name i like. And let me tell you, up until i had my daughter, my mother in law would call me all the time when she thought of a different name. next time it will be a surprise. I might let everyone know what the sex is, for gifts. good luck ans congrats on being preg!|`|3AfQ9UXYaa	I think you're being very smart. 1. People do steal names & 2. People like to force their opinions on people especially when it comes to baby names. I'm not pregnant and people are already telling me they don't like my names and give me a bunch of names I never asked for or are just plain rude. When I do get pregnant in the future I'm keeping my mouth shut.|`|wQajkvkTaa	no of course not. its your child. no one has to know. if they think its selfish and unfair, then they are pathetic. you have every right to keep the sex and name to yourself until your baby is born. that way it will be a surprise for every one.|`|Zew5sfbyaa	no not at all, you will have ppl tell you they don't like it and what not and want  you to change it. If you don't want to tell anyone then don't|`|dR2bqUixaa	Not at all. It's up to you to share whatever you want throughout your pregnancy. Don't let people pressure you into telling them.|`|HB3fDXeMaa	no....just tell them its all apart of the surprise when the baby comes ;)
q4WtQvSZaa	It took me about 8 weeks after my miscarriage, and then a few cycles after that for my body to get back to 'normal'.  The pregnancy hormones can still be present in your body for quite a while after the pregnancy ends - but it could also be a new pregnancy for you.

Fh4B88ZGaa	Go on Ebay or Craigslist and see what people are asking for similar strollers, that will give you an idea of price range. Most are much newer than 2001, so you're probably going to have to cut your price pretty low to get any takers.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	How much did you pay for it?<br>  It's pretty old so I'd say 25-30% of what you paid for it.
rh5HjBJbaa	The sore boobs part I can totally relate to. I knew a few days after conceiving that I was pregnant just by the soreness of the girls. But the fever or you being very hot doesn't really sound like a symptom. That could be something unrelated. I would definitely be on the look out for other symptoms. And then test in a week or so if you don't start your period next week. But sore boobs...yes, high indicator! My husband couldn't even brush past my bra-covered breasts without me wincing in the beginning!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	My breasts started aching within 10 days of conception.|`|EULVtVDvaa	Mine hurt almost immediately with my last pregnancy and not with my 1st.|`|q4WtQvSZaa	I had really sore breasts very early on with my last pregnancy, it was the first sign I had that I might be actually.  It was probably 10 days before my period was due which is what made me realise something was up!  Hope you get the result you want.|`|Zrdg3XJlaa	It could be pms or preganancy.... IT all depends on your body. You could take a test and find out, but a sure sign will be if you get ready to eat one of your favroite things and all of a sudden you get extreme nasuea. THEN i would definetly take a test.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I had sore boobs when I was 3 weeks along, but it was also accompanied by what I thought was the flu. That "flu" lasted two weeks until I finally took a test. It's hard to tell in your case though, sore boobs are also related to pms before you start your cycle. I think you may have overdone yourself on your trip, and may your body is just acting up because of it. Wait a few more weeks, like mid-march.. and if your period doesn't start then take a test.
fOxS7EE7aa	if you are TTC:  make sure you take folic acid, exercise regularly, and avoid alcohol or smoking.  this is to prepare your body and make it conducive for a small bean to live in for 9 months.<br>  <br>  if pregnant:  maintain vitamins (folic acid), drink lots of water, plenty of rest, eat a well-balanced diet.
vuUVmS7Saa	"it were an accident! and she doesnt even no who the father is" <br>  <br>  classic! i don't think her parents would be 'proud' if your friend told them that part, the end part!<br>  <br>  i think 15 is to young, and your friend will have a crap future in front of her if she has a baby at this age!|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Are you the same troll that posts about farsical miscarriages? Go post somewhere else. Women on here wait for a long time to conceive so make believe stories about pregnant teens are not appreciated.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry, there has been someone with the name Lucy and various last letters after it posting fake and offensive questions. There isn't any need to swear either, it is vulgar and immature.<br>  <br>  As for your friend she needs support, her mum may just be saying she is proud that she hasn't had an abortion. It is a brave decision to make!<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh god grow up. I apologised and yes I am more mature than you because unlike you I can clearly construct a sentence, I am capable of admitting when I am wrong and I can say I am sorry. My daughter will have a fantastic life regardless of the opinion of some teenager, shall I even try and convey why people thought you were trolling again? Probably not, you are far too infantile to understand and your friend needs someone better than you to be seeking advice for her.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	She made the choice to have sex, she made the choice to keep that.<br>  <br>  If she can do it, I would be proud too, that is a very tough thing to do at such a young age.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	My view is: your a troll just looking to stir up trouble.|`|fJ7OeopSaa	I think its fine as long as she has the support of her mum. I got pregnant at 16 and now my daughter is the best thing in my life and i'm a student, so it is not as though your friend will not have the same opportunities as the government are very supportive to get teenagers back into education after having a baby. You should be supportive to her, it is the most scary thing in the world to have a baby, and as her friend you should be there for her.|`|XpLufXKFaa	If that was my daughter I would be proud of her too.<br>  Sure, she should have used birth control. Sure, she should have talked to someone before becoming sexually active, but now she is taking responsibility. <br>  <br>  My mother had me when she was 15 (pregnant at 14). I like to think that I turned out okay, and I think that she is a wonderful mother, my best friend as well.|`|f9lZK2aKaa	My heart goes out to you for being such a concerned friend. Everyone needs someone to care for them. I am sad that at 15, this child is pregnant. She is going to need support, compassion and love. Please give her a hug from me as well. This has to be scary for her right now. I am proud of her decision to have the baby. If she chooses to raise the baby or have the baby adopted she will need a special friend like you. Thank you for being so kind to this precious child.<br>  God Bless you all!! You are all in my prayers.|`|jM6xUrrRaa	In some countries people marry and have children at 12, so it is not that young.<br>  It is good that her parents are supporting her, through what is likely a difficult time.<br>  <br>  It is better she has the child rather than kill it, she will love it more than anything else in the world, and in the unlikely event she doesn't, at that age she would easily be able to put it up for adoption.|`|Pd1Dout5aa	what a nob|`|2JKt3Nkqaa	Totally immature!

796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	If there is no family or friends that are capable and willing to care for the child, then the child will be placed in temporary foster care. They will set up a schedule for the foster family to bring the child to visit the sick mother so the bond will still be there. The foster family will be responsible for all the child's needs as well as getting him/her to and from school and doctors appointments. The foster care will be temporary though, he/she will remain in care until the mother is released from the hospital and able to fully take care of her child. A social worker will be able to walk the mother through all the steps and answer any questions she may have.<br>  <br>  If this is your situation or someone you know then I wish all the best for the mother and child. I hope the surgery and recovery go well. I also hope the child has plenty of support to get through this very trying time.<br>  <br>  If you are a friend of this woman and are able to care for the child, you can request to take the child in! You can do it with the mother or do it legally with a social worker. Either way it's always better for the child to be with someone they already know rather then a family they've never met. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.<br>  Brit|`|jgtfWjE4aa	if you have any friends at all that you trust enough to leave in your daughters care, please do so. or maybe someone that you know well. please don't let this child have to stay in foster care. maybe they can arrange something at the hospital...it also depends on the childs age.<br>  <br>  good luck and god bless.|`|28QPS6V9aa	She would have to hire a nanny. The child can't stay in the hospital for months so if there is absolutely no friends or family to watch the child the woman would just have to find a full time nanny for a few months.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	then the child goes in to foster care until the mother is well again<br>  <br>  edit: what? y the thumbs down? she said there's no family im gonna assume there's no friends either|`|rUPjr7hjaa	The child will have to stay with friends.  <br>  I don't think the hospital will allow the child to stay with the mother.|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	either let her stay at one of your freinds place, or let her stay with one of her friends.  if not cas or cps or whatever you have there will take her and it may be hard to get her back.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	She can either hire a nanny for her child or if she can't afford that then the kid could be turned over to the state for a few months.|`|kprKXEOSaa	If the woman doesn't have a relative or friend or neighbor, or maybe a friend of the child whose family could have them come stay for a while, yes, I guess foster care.  It also depends on the age of the child.  A 4-year-old is clearly different than a <br>  16-year-old.<br>  Or, yes, hire someone.  There are a lot of options.|`|AA10628838	The child will become a ward of the state since there is no parent to take care of the child.|`|oojO4WAraa	She had better find someone to take care of the kid - a friend, a distant relative, or someone.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Unfortunately, the child will go to Foster Care.|`|AA10494763	friends or the child goes into foster care until the parent recovers but it is better to have someone you know and trust
lTDeZ0Obaa	Zantac is a histamine blocker, Prevacid is a proton-pump inhibitor...so, they work in different ways to control acid production and therefore help reflux. Safe to take both. But, to ease your mind check with your pharmacist before giving to your granddaughter. <br>  <br>  Sometimes with severe acid reflux it takes more than one medication to control. <br>  <br>  Usually infants with acid reflux like this will take the medication for a time, then outgrow it as their system matures.<br>  <br>  Another option is to seek a second opinion, but uncontrolled acid reflux can cause other medical issues, too. (Such as ulcers.)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|X6as2nOAaa	I would call another doc for a 2nd opinon.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Firstly if you ever have questions about medication dosage, usage, or interactions speak to a pharmacist.  Any pharmacist will help you, though depending on how long your question is going to take you may need an appointment.  <br>  <br>  Secondly always try to fill your prescriptions at the same pharmacy, there is a very good reason that doctors' prescriptions are checked by a pharmacist, and why pharmacists go through a long education process.  If you can't use the same drug store be sure that they know at least all your current medications and medical conditions.<br>  <br>  However as to zantac and prevacid you wouldn't generally use them together because they have the same function -they both prevent acid production.  But prevacid is a proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and zantac is a H2-antagonists so it is possible that they are safe together and work well together.<br>  <br>  <br>  Zantac <a href="http://chealth.canoe.ca/drug_info_details.asp?brand_name_id=26" rel="nofollow">http://chealth.canoe.ca/drug_info_detail...</a><br>  <br>  Prevacid <a href="http://chealth.canoe.ca/drug_info_details.asp?brand_name_id=38&rot=4" rel="nofollow">http://chealth.canoe.ca/drug_info_detail...</a>|`|zDeEaja0aa	If the pediatrician prescribed both then it most likely safe to take them together, but your granddaughter  very young to be two types of medication if you can avoid it. <br>  <br>  I would suggest seeing a different pediatrician for a second opinion and see what he/she says. I would really recommend finding a doctor or talking to yours in find a single medication that will help your granddaughter.|`|Ev473XbHaa	Hi, my mom's doctor prescribed prevacid for her acid reflux to. It's ok for her to take them both, just make sure you watch the side effects the she gets from taking them. My mom had to stop taking prevacid because she got extremely nauseous like morning sickness, so the doctor had to give her new stuff to take. So I would just be careful and watch her side effects.|`|UghJ0XROaa	My 4 month old is on baby Zantac for acid reflux, it's very common, check with the pharmacist to make sure it's safe to take them together, just to be safe, but a lot of babies are on the zantac for reflux.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	If they were prescribed to her then it is probably safe to take them. You can call a pharmacy though and they will tell you or talk to the babies parents and find out what the doc said when he prescribed them both.. give your doubts to them and see what they do with it, they might be able to ring the doc and ask about it|`|2LmfQUbKaa	you can always call the pharmacy near you and ask if you are not sure they can tell you good luck|`|nQPcbjLKaa	Get a second opinion from a doctor.

If she has reflux, then there is something wrong, and it needs to be investigated thoroughly.  Pyloric Stenosis comes to mind, though she is a little old for that, but there is definitely something wrong. See your Doctor ASAP. If this doctor has given you this medicine, then go to another one.|`|Eh6MnODtaa	My son started to have very bad reflux around 6 months. He was prescribed Prevacid but in a compounded form. Well, it worked for a week or so (after about a week) but stopped once we were close to finish the medicine bottle. The liquid one looses it`s strength quickly plus it tastes bad. Usually you need to give it to baby 30 min. before feeding (no one told us until I checked on the internet) on empty stomach. I would get the solutabs, these pills melt fast and they have a berry taste. They work soooo much better, since my son is using these he is a different baby! I don`t know if it is safe to use it with Zantac but I would check with pharmacist and also on the internet how soon you could give it to baby after or before prevacid. You don`t want them not to work because they were given too close in time.|`|53e2d759e6c39f6a168182d57c4d68b1aa	You should use one or the other. Not both.

I had my first baby at 24 and my second at 26.  I wouldn't change it for the world, but looking back, I realize I was REALLY young.  I wouldn't redo it because I wouldn't have the great babies I do have, but I sometimes wonder what I could have accomplished if I didn't have them.  But either way in choice of hindsight, I'd rather have my babies.  What I'm trying to say is live and do all the things you can do without babies because once you have em you can't send them back!  Travel, go to school, etc.  It's not impossible to do that and have them at the same age, but with children you have their needs first and foremost where as if you wait you only have you and maybe your partner.  If you can handle it all, go for it!|`|3rda58OCaa	Um, that person is selfish and wrong!  My daughter IS my life!! I would rather be with her and do fun things with her over anything else!!

I still go out once a month or so without my baby, and am so happy to get back home to be with her.  I know one day she will be grown and moved on, and all i will have is time for me.  <br>  <br>  If you are financially stable enough to have a baby and you and hubby are ready then go ahead.  You know what is best for you and your family.  I will tell you though having your child is TOTALLY different that just being somebody who loves kids! It is so much harder when it is your own child and not someone else's that you can return.|`|gdCqKl89aa	Honestly, I'm very happy having my children younger than older.

XTuhGaL1aa	My daughter is 10 months old but when she was 9 months old she ate the same amount.<br>  <br>  My daughter can definitley eat 2 jars of baby food at 1 sitting; 1 jar of veggies and 1 jar of fruit.<br>  <br>  She is 30'' long and 23 lbs|`|3rda58OCaa	Your son's body will tell you when it is too much.  If he is eating happily let him have it.  He isn't going to stretch his stomach at 9 months old!  That doesn't sound like too much at all for a 26 lb boy.  He is a big boy and needs 2 jars (if not more) to stay healthy and strong.  Baby food is healthy and not going to make him fat.  Your hubby is going to give him a complex on eating, don't worry about how much he eats as long as he is eating healthy and is active.|`|LbkLg4RFaa	At nine months our son was probably eating the equivilent of two jars of baby food or more a day through self-feeding eg a whole banana for breakfast and some vegies for dinner.  Even after having bottles first.  He was a big boy as well at about 25 lbs and 32" long.  Since he hit one year old though his food intake has slowed considerably.  As they grow older and their growth slows down their appetite adjusts.|`|JUYjyP0xaa	feed him what the serving size says. Snacks are also a good idea. he is probably entering the "chubby stage".|`|oJ5lT19naa	Wow, he is chubby.<br>  <br>  But I suggest giving him whatever he can eat.<br>  <br>  Chubby babies are cute...:-)<br>  <br>  Not all 9-month-olds eat that way, but if he can eat...yes.|`|FHT6wsUpaa	My daughter has never eaten that much volume in one sitting. She was feeding herself at 7 months, so I always thought that by her eating whole foods, she was getting as much nutrition as what's in jarred food anyway. Even now, she doesn't eat that much at a meal. By comparison, she's 23lbs and 28-1/2"...a little chubbier than she is tall, which is how she's always been. I have always found it funny because she seriously doesn't eat that much!<br>  <br>  I don't think there's a problem. If your son isn't hungry for the food, trust me he'll let you know it. Good luck!|`|hrMhhB4Saa	i rarely give my 9 1.2 month old jarred food. but when i do. i give him 1 jar of stage 3. and i offerf about 5 oz of formula about half hour after.  my son was 20 lbs 12 oz at his 9 month check up

And you should stay in bed, because you don't want to get in the way when Mr Sun, is doing his work.

6Z4fKZ8aaa	Because parents that don't let their kids date are smart and are avoiding becoming grandparents young or being forced to take care of their grandkids when their teenage daughter doesn't want to take care of her own mistake.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	Because of sex. Children, and that's what teens are, have no business having sex. They don't truly understand the possible consequences. Babies shouldn't be having babies.<br>  <br>  EDIT: ahhh the thumbs down. That's fine. I just don't understand why kids can't be kids anymore. They dress (not all of them) so slutty sometimes. Kids need to be kids; go to movies or the mall, hang out with your friends. SEX is serious. Save that for when you're mature.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Its the whole sex issue, also, dating takes time away from studying. There are a lot of issues. One thing that scares me is the increase of teen girls being kidnapped and sold into sex slavery.....Note to self, don't watch those kind of shows right before bed :)|`|FiUprYsvaa	Because they rather say no than set rules and guidelines and teach their son/daughter to be decent humans, who respect themselves and know when to say no and when the time is right.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	Very simply since more and more sexual activity is happening at a younger and younger age, the idea of keeping you or any teen from dating in their eyes is a way to protect you.  I guess it is a way for them to try to look out for you and keep a certain behavior from accuring.|`|BphZi9yDaa	cuz they were teens once, and they know what alot of teens do, they arent stupid|`|KlWWh3fgaa	That their pretty wise people !|`|a83540b91773168b974dd778ba6da299aa	Paranoia of underage sex.|`|AA12006899	becouse  of the not knowing think about that and youll no what i mean <br>  <br>  (links with my other answer i answerd 4 u)|`|bw6ZsRUJaa	SEX AND DRUGS|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	so they dont become teen parents =)|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Sex and underage pregnancy
P5Iq6nufaa	Sure, as long as I have gotten to know the boy she is dating. In addition, I need to know what the date will consist of, I get to set a curfew (usually 11:00, my daughter is 17 now), and there need to be adults who are in charge wherever they are going. Dating is fine with ground rules and expectations. Some people have an age at which they allow dating, I think it depends on the teen and the nature of the date. I allowed my daughter "dates" at 14 that were directly supervised by adults and didn't go past 8:00 PM. At 16, I relaxed the rules a little as she has proven she is responsible enough to be allowed out longer and without direct supervision, i.e., someone on the date with you as opposed to the adults present at movies or restaurants.|`|AA12006899	yes but i let them date when there 16 and i want to meet the guy/girl<br>  i know its seems un romantic and embaressing  but u have a right to know who ur child is gonna pash <br>  <br>  as much as u dont want them to grow up  you have to let them go this will be sad and mean but let them make a relationship even if its a disaster so when they do break up and ur childs in tears at the same time they have expirience<br>  <br>  ty|`|CrYc4TTSaa	Only at my house or church events.. no reason at all to be alone except to get into trouble..Let them go to movies with parents that I know sitting right behind|`|2cd3d2c0f6c6a8ff7014103038b8a67baa	my 15 year old step son is dating.  at least the girl is a good girl.<br>  <br>  her, we let him date.

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The Dr uses their fingers to separate the bag of water from the cervix  to stimulate production of prostiglandins in the cervix and bring on contractions. Sometimes it can be painful. Dr's say that it usually puts the woman into labor within 2 days, but I have known women that it didn't work for and were still pregnant a week later. It isn't intended to break your water but it can and it can also cause infection. There has been some controversy about it bc health care providers have done it without the knowledge or consent of the patient.|`|tAFPbAUaaa	I have had my membranes stripped three times (once with my third son, who was born 6 hours later and twice with my 11 month old daughter, who I still had to be induced with) and the doctor just stretched and scraped my cervix with his fingers. It is pretty uncomfortable and maybe even a little painful, but I am sure willing to do it again since the chances are it will speed up labor!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	I believe they rub a tool along your cervix to help make you dilated faster and if you have any mucus plug left in there it will make it come out.

I've been reading about it alot on here as well and was very confused as to what all happens.  <br>  But, from what I've heard, it doesn't sound very pleasant!|`|azE51WGRaa	I can answer your question because I had it done when I was pregnant with my daughter. What the doctor does is insert their finger into the vagina and seperates the amniotic sac from the cervix (they use a sweeping motion with their finger.) This frees the cervix from the amniotic sac. It's called stripping because there are membranes that hold the sac to the cervix and by stripping them, they're being removed. This usually irritates the cervix enough to start dilating. Hope this answers your question.|`|vcxdTXbraa	The doc sticks their finger through your cervix and seperates the amniotic sack from your uterus. It usually will put you into labor.

R21aV2mLaa	the way i see it, is that you are an adult and and you seem to have been supporting your other kids, your mother is just worried that your not going to have much of a life if you have so many kids, but i am sure that your mom loves your 2 kids now and she will love the 3rd one, i say dont stress about it and not let your mom bother you by that...my sister inlaw has 3 kids and she just turned 20 in october and my brother cant be there right now not because he doesnt want to but because he is gone right now, she is making it just fine so i am sure you being 22 you should be able to make it!! get the father for every penny with child support!! good luck to you!!|`|bb2cafcc1198c3f1dea9c78f472dc7e9aa	It does not  make it better that all three of your kids have the same father when your not together. Can you blame your mom shes gonna find out anyway and she probably freak even worse.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Yikes 3 kids at 22 you dont like an easy life do you lol Look whats done is done, your mom will probably be even more upset this time but its done now and theres nothing that can be done.<br>  <br>  You will just have to tell her, she will probably yell and scream again and not talk to you for a few days but she will calm down, just like she did last time. I assume you were using contraception? Tell her whatever it was it didnt work and you will be more careful in future. She will be upset I dont think you can avoid that but shes your mom, she loves you anyhow and she will calm down.|`|hKv7RcKLaa	Well I am also pregnant. I am three months along. The best way to tell her is to just be completely straight with her and don't beat around the bush. The longer you wait its possible she will be madder that you waited. But do what you think is best. When you start showing eventually she will know for sure lol obviously. I wish you luck though but that is what I did.|`|AztPvbauaa	Hmmmm,if i were you i would brace up and tell my mom.You need to talk to her.

47b941d3c5e5316f5f468cc99f1c559faa	I'm not sure about how to get him to take the formula. I would just keep offering it to him and I would think he would eventually take it. As for sterilizing bottles and things, we were told by our pediatrician that it was ok to stop at 4 months old. We have always used distilled water for making formula, but they say city water is fine straight from the tap. We live in a rural area with frequent boil water advisories and we don't even drink tap water so that's why we use bottled.|`|qMYbGqiwaa	You only have to sterilize the bottles and accessories one time (before the first use)  And you do not have to use boiled water to make powdered formula. <br>  <br>   I thought I had to use boiled water with my first child and my pediatrician said "he's going to drink tap water the rest of his life so it's not going to hurt him now!"  So after that I have always used tap water and never had any problems.  I use Born Free bottles, which I love-they never, ever leak and I run them through the dishwasher and they just keep on going.  They are costly-$19.99 for 2 9oz bottles but honeslty it is so worth it because they are such high quality.  <br>  <br>  If you get a powdered formula dispenser (they cost about $2 at wal mart) you can measure your power into the little bins and then your caregiver can fill the bottles with warm water and just dump the premeasured formula into the bottles and they will be ready to go.  The formula dispensers hold 4 servings of formula, and they have been a lifesaver to me.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	I don't know what to tell you about the formula thing.  My baby is 6 weeks, I introduced the bottle at about 4 weeks, he will take one with breast milk but not formula.  <br>  <br>  I would only sterlize the nipples when they are brand new, just like I would any other dishes I use in the house.  A doctor once told my mom (and my sister in the medical profession concurs) that sterilizing nipples is pointless, once they hit the air of a non sterile enviroment, they are no longer sterile.  <br>  <br>  I like Playtex Nursers, that is what I use for my guy.  they are similar to the nipple and easier to clean since you just drop in a new liner each time (if you are worried about them being sterile, this is a great option).|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I sterilized the bottles & nipples & rings only once. I asked my baby's pediatrician. She said at least the first time sterilize & wash. Then just wash & rinse in really hot water.<br>  No need to boil water either. We had a tap filter but that broke. I was leary of using our tap water but I just use cold tap water (not good to use hot), heat water up in the microwave (a 2 c. Pyrex measuring cup is what we use) oh, i heat it for abt 2 min or so then plop the bottle in for a few, checking it obviously.<br>  What brand bottles do you use? I use Avent which I don't recommend because they leak but they are suppose to be like the mother's nipple. Mix some formula & breastmilk for a bit to see if he takes that. Mostly breastmilk & tiny bit of formula then gradually increase it to just formula over a period of days.<br>  Good luck!

Continue to nurse your baby, letting him completely drain one breast before moving to the next one. After he's finished nursing, then pump to make sure there is no milk left. Take tylenol for the pain, especially before nursing (take 30 minutes before).<br>  <br>  After you start taking the antibiotics it will only take a couple of days to feel better but be sure to complete all the antibiotics given or it may come back.<br>  <br>  Get better soon.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i have had severe Mastitis THREE times!! yes, its horrible isn't it?? my doctor (each time) advised me NOT to let my daughter breastfeed. he recommended that i formula feed (as much as it hurt to do it, because i wanted to only breastfeed *sighs). do you have it with both breasts? if its just the one then allow him to feed off the breast that does NOT have the infection. your baby will get sick if he feeds off the infected breast. also, if you just have it in the one breast and you breastfeed with the other, and your using a painkiller, make sure you only use tylenol (acetaminophen). as for the pain, you can take a shower and let the warm water run on your infected breast(s), and compress or pump it if you choose to, but then throw it out. dont let your baby have it.<br>  <br>  each time when i had it, i just took the meds (which help sooooo much!!) and took a nice hot shower and let the water run over my breasts. i had it in both one time...horrible!! my doctor convinced me to formula feed *biiiiig sigh because of it. it sucks, but i just kept getting the infection. if you have more questions you can still call labor and delivery or the ER and USUALLY someone can help you out with it. i have called before and i had it when my daughter was 2 months old.<br>  <br>  good luck to you!! once you get the meds in your body, you will start to feel sooooooooo much better!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  ADDED: OKAY SCREW ALL THE THUMBS DOWN.

EVERYTHING I SAID IS "TRIED AND TRUE" AS THEY SAY.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	For the poster whose Doc advised to ff when having mastitis- your doc is obviously horribly misinformed when it comes to bfing. I'm so sorry! One of the best things to do with mastitis or plugged ducts is to bf. I'd seriously be looking into a malpractice suit and file a few complaints against him for bad medical advice. <br>  <br>  Here's some great info:<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/mastitis.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  GENERAL SUPPORTIVE MEASURES <br>  Plugged Duct<br>  <br>  Rest <br>  Adequate fluids <br>  Nutritious foods will help to strengthen mom's immune system <br>   Mastitis<br>  <br>  Bed rest (preferably with baby) <br>  Increase fluids, adequate nutrition <br>  Get help around the house <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  BREASTFEEDING MANAGEMENT<br>   -- SAME for plugged duct or mastitis <br>   -- important to start treatment promptly <br>  "Heat, Massage, Rest, Empty Breast" <br>   <br>  General Nurse frequently & empty the breasts thoroughly. <br>  Aim for nursing at least every 2 hrs. Keep the affected breast as empty as possible, but don’t neglect the other breast. <br>  When unable to breastfeed, mom should express milk frequently and thoroughly (with a breast pump or by hand). <br>   <br>      <br>  Before nursing Use heat & gentle massage before nursing <br>  - Warm compress. Try using a disposable diaper: fill the diaper with hot water (try the temperature on your wrist first to avoid burns), squeeze the diaper out a bit, then put the inside of the diaper toward the breast. This will stay warm much longer than a wet cloth.<br>  - Basin soak. Fill sink or bowl with hot water and submerge breast in water while massaging the plugged area toward the nipple. Some report better results when epsom salts are added to the water -- add a handful of epsom salts per 2 quarts (2 liters) of water. Rinse with fresh water before nursing, as baby may object to the taste.<br>  - Hot Shower. It can be helpful to massage in the shower with a large-toothed comb. The comb should be drawn through a bar of soap until it is very soapy and then used to gently massage over the affected area in the direction of the nipple. <br>  Loosen bra & any constrictive clothing to aid milk flow. <br>   <br>      <br>  While nursing Nurse on the affected breast first; if it hurts too much to do this, switch to the affected breast directly after let-down. <br>  Ensure good positioning & latch. Use whatever positioning is most comfortable and/or allows the plugged area to be massaged. <br>  Note: Advice to point baby's chin (or nose) toward the plugged area is not necessarily going to be helpful as it is based on the idea that the milk ducts take a nice, direct route to the nipple - recent research tells us that this is not true, and that a particular duct might begin in one area of the breast but can "wander" in many different directions before terminating in any area of the nipple. <br>  Use breast compressions. <br>  Massage gently but firmly from the plugged area toward the nipple. <br>  Try nursing while leaning over baby (sometimes called "dangle feeding") so that gravity aids in dislodging the plug. <br>   <br>      <br>  After nursing Pump or hand express after nursing to aid milk drainage and speed healing. <br>  Use cold compresses between feedings for pain & inflammation. <br>   <br>      <br>    See also How do you treat a milk blister? <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>   <br>  MEDICATION * <br>  Plugged duct Mastitis <br>  Analgesia<br>  Pain reliever/anti-inflammatory <br>  (e.g., ibuprofen) <br>  Second choice – pain reliever alone <br>  (e.g.,acetaminophen) <br>   Analgesia<br>  Same as for plugged duct <br>   <br>  Antibiotic?<br>  No <br>   Antibiotic?<br>  No: If symptoms are mild and have been present for less than 24 hours. <br>  Yes: If symptoms are not improving in 12-24 hours, or if mom is acutely ill.<br>    <br>  Most common pathogen is penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. <br>  Typical antibiotics used for mastitis:<br>  - Dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cloxacillin, amoxycillin-clavulinic acid<br>  - Cephalexin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, nafcillin <br>  Most recommend 10-14 day treatment to prevent relapse. Do not discontinue treatment earlier than prescribed. <br>  Consider probiotic to reduce thrush risk.<br>    <br>  Some mothers also use natural treatments. <br>   <br>  * Consult your health care provider for guidance in your specific situation.

Non-infectious mastitis can usually be resolved without the use of antibiotics. However, per the World Health Organization document Mastitis: Causes and Management, "Without effective removal of milk, non-infectious mastitis was likely to progress to infectious mastitis, and infectious mastitis to the formation of an abscess."<br>  <br>  Per the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine's Clinical Protocol for Mastitis:<br>  <br>  "If symptoms of mastitis are mild and have been present for less than 24 hours, conservative manag|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Warm your breast- take a bath and let the water help. Then, manually express with your breast submerged- it helped me so much. <br>  <br>  Use a heating pad on that side.<br>  Motrin<br>  Allow baby to nurse on that side more- baby is far better at helping to clear it up than a pump.

256cVXsmaa	There more like little bubbles or fluttery feeling in your stomach at first.  By 20 weeks I started feeling actual kicks inside.  The kicks get more intense as time goes on.  Now that i'm 24 weeks there so strong that my toes literally curl at times.  Sometimes he will roll around and my whole stomach will shift back and forth, it's awesome.  But as for now you will probably feel a little flutter here and there, you really have to concentrate on it though.  Maybe lie on your back and just concentrate for a few minutes, you'll probably feel something strange.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I felt it at 19 weeks but only at night when I was laying flat.  By week 20 it was more obvious and comes at random times (still more at night or anytime I'm laying or sitting still).  The last couple of days my husband is able to feel the baby and I can see my stomach move when the baby kicks.  Doctors say by 22 weeks you should feel kicks.|`|rJ7QfQ0Raa	i felt mine around 18 weeks. It wasnt totally obvious to me until 20 weeks. the only reason i knew he was kicking at 18 weeks was because when i went for my ultrasound i knew that what i was feeling was the baby moving.|`|TUSNeUCcaa	With a 1st Pregnancy you should be able to feel your Baby moving from now on just slight movements at 1st then of course getting stronger with each passing wk You could try laying down as it's easier to feel it when you are relaxed|`|GAxJNvxmaa	every pregnancy is different, remember that :)<br>  <br>  i first felt my baby's actual kicks when i was around 24 weeks.|`|UgIOVl1jaa	I felt flutters since 18weeks & stronger bumps & thumps from 22weeks.

J6DmEUTeaa	Hiya, my daughter is 17mnths and she is my whole world.She is my only child and wev never spent a day apart since she was born. We have the most amazing bond and now i trust no one with her. I havnt yet had to let go but i am so dreadig when i do. But i know that where ever she goes like school etc she will always be coming back to me at the end of the day. It will be hard. I think mams have a more intense bond so the fathers dont really understand all the fuss. I think when the time comes il just see it as her going through the motions and mainly looking forward to her return. It also makes me realise to make the most of all time you have 2gether. Good luck.|`|KJiXs4yraa	i feel your pain. i had six kids and two of them (6 and 8) died in a car accident. now im very afraid of the other 4.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I didn't have problems with that.  Kimberly was a very independent, smart child, and she loved school.  The school bus picked her up at our door and dropped her back off.<br>  <br>  We had more problems with our son, Joel, but it was more I wanted him to go, but he didn't want to lol.  It turned out there was a learning disability hiding there.<br>  <br>  Don't let your son hear about this from you, and don't pass on any attitudes or feelings.  Kids are master manipulators, and if yours detects your soft spot, he's going to play it to the max, in fact, he'll take over.  It will be horrible in your house the day your son is king.<br>  <br>  Be strong, get a pet, maybe a part-time job or volunteer.  Don't leave yourself lonely and unoccupied so you can just sit there all day and think about your baby.  It's not healthy.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|fdnbXfvfaa	Hey don't worry. Every mother goes through it.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Just let him go out more. <br>  You'll get used to it.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	is he the only constant man in your life ?<br>  <br>  honestly, if it is you need to just let go|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Jeez...I thought you had a kid going off to war or something. You are doing what every parent does when you realize your baby is no longer a baby. It's sweet,  natural, and you'll be over it soon.. Remember, he can't grow up well and strong if you don't let him. EDIT** I don't blame you one bit for being nervous about other people. You wouldn't be a good mother if you weren't! I'd check out anyone thoroughly before I'd let my kid go with anyone, and even then there is no guarantee..it's tough! And the worry never ends.<br>       Also, ignore the moronic abortion comment. it's stupid  people like that, that makes us all worry about our kids.|`|xvey8ixPaa	Mine is 20 and I still have a hard time. I think it is helping them be independent even though you feel like screaming inside. I have seen parents not teach a child to be an independent person so that they can keep them next to them. I do not think this is right at all. Mine is my only and I hated seeing her go off to day care and Kindergarten and every little thing she did up to now....she is in college and very smart and capable. I just keep my mouth shut a lot and let her do. I taught her to drive, i taught her how to look for work and how to cook and clean. I have taught her to do her homework and to help other people. She has been with me a lot, but also told to go off and make her way. I cry a lot. but, I do know that when I am gone form this world she can take care of herself becuase I taught her and let her learn. You can let him go with other people and let them have their relationships with him. It is important for him to have his own self away from you. I do little things for myself. When she was younger and was somewhere i was not, I had a specific book I only read when she was away from me. I can't stand being away form her, but I try not to be overbearing. She is at work right now, and I can't stand it! So, when you are close to your kids, I do not care if it is only one or not, you want to be with them. But, you have to let him grow, and sometimes that means being away from you! You will be ok. I am ok. It is just hard, that is all.

xRZ1PRZwaa	What an awkward situation. Wow.<br>  <br>  Well, it's important for your MIL to hold your baby. Maybe you can get away with letting your MIL know that your baby's favourite way to be held and cuddled is over the shoulder. You may get away with her being able to hold the baby and having your baby avoid the breath at the same time.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, to be quite frank, your husband should speak to his mother about the problem (NOT YOU!). It is his responsibility to ensure that your newborn be comfortable and to deal with his own parent. You may want to present it to him that the baby will not want to be held by her, and the baby pushing away may hurt her your mother-in-law's feelings more than simply discussing her breath problem with her (and it's true, if it's stinky, the baby may recede or react poorly).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps a bit - good luck hon!|`|HqOkC2YHaa	Have breathe mints at the door to you room and say it's mandatory when someone comes in to have one(that way she won't be offended if you just casually give just her one) or possibly gum...that and wash their hands or use the hand sanitizer<br>  <br>  But it is pretty silly, but I did some pretty silly things when my daughter was born too|`|XkWTsyJdaa	hahahaha no dw, its not like shes actually sick.|`|jaA4zCEIaa	maybe its your breath makin the child sick|`|gpNF2Ocsaa	No need to keep her from enjoying her new grandchild. The bacteria responsible for caries and bad breath are only an issue after teething occurs when they can colonize the mouth and lead to the same problems in childhood (namely cavities and bad breath.) So I wouldn't start worrying about that until around 5-8 months when babies normally start teething.<br>  <br>  Kissing baby's hands is another issue altogether as viruses and other illness are easily transferred in this manner. That's why you should always tell family and well wishers to kiss Jr on the forehead only if they choose to show their affection.|`|hTieELhTaa	Stop being such a b and worring about such minute things!! You sound really syuck up and self centered to me, It would be very inconsiderate to not let your mother in law hold her new grandchild for any reason other than that she was abusive! If I were your husband I would be pist off at you for being such a B to his family. I hope he treats your mom the same way you treat his!!!|`|8WbfmK5daa	Stop being so mean is what you should do!<br>  <br>  That is your husband's mother and your child's grandmother. <br>  <br>  It will not harm your child even if it is that bad stop being so disrespectful.<br>  <br>  How would you like it in 30yrs time if your child would not allow you to hold your grandchild cause you 'smell' you would be heartbroken.<br>  <br>  No wonder your husband is upset.|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	Ha!  It's not going to make your baby sick (in the literal sense, anyway!)...  A lady I work with has chronic halitosis and she tried to hold my daughter when she was a little baby - my daughter cried, so she gave her back.  If this happens with you, you could (nicely!) address the situation and offer some mints!  Please don't keep her from her grandchild because of bad breath!|`|OYjZM4Pjaa	You should let her hold the baby, I mean it's only bad breath. Now, if she comes in wearing last season's fashions, now that would be grounds for showing her the door.  <br>  Come on girl! She may have a medical reason for the bad breath. Just let her hold the baby, and stand far away from her.|`|3irrWRUWaa	think you are being mean. your baby is a newborn so they don't know.if her breath stink why don't you tell her? or let her hold the baby when baby is sleep.you sound like you just don't like her.|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	Yes that would be very inconsiderate.  She is grandma, let her hold her grandchild and put your pettiness aside for a minute.|`|955YoHvVaa	Of course it's inconsiderate of you..its her grandchild and just because she has bad breath you won't allow her to hold her grand kid? Rather immature if you ask me.|`|sZX7O6rtaa	Congratulation on being a new mother. Also just a tip dont be paranoid about being a mother, because it can make you very stressful, just be calm and relaxed. Um but your question: Idk if you would be very inconsiderate, but not letting your mother in law hold the baby she could be very confused on why she cant hold the baby. I think it would be best to tell her the truth, but at least your telling her and not keeping it a secret and not telling her hold the baby. Try discussing it with your husband and see what he says. Again congrats on being a mother and hopefully everything works out for the best.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Are you serious? Everyone smells from time to time. Are you going to excuse yourself from the baby every time you have to pass gas or brush your teeth before you nurse her. I seriously doubt it. If it doesn't hinder her health in any way then I wouldn't worry about it. Your baby is not going to remember her grandmommy having stinking breath. I promise.|`|5saz2WV0aa	hahahahahaha<br>  <br>  let her hold the baby!!!<br>  but i understand... bad smells offend me too. and strong smells are no better. i told my own mom that there was a no perfume rule his first months of life. <br>  it would be inconsiderate though.<br>  but i get you.. mostly since it bothers you so much its like u can't imagine subjecting your own child to the torture.. no matter who you offend!  but it is not the real world<br>  ask your husband to tell his mom her breath stinks. tell him to make it look like the comment is coming from him. she can't get mad at him he is her son, but she can (and probably will) get mad and offended by you.|`|gTOmztJxaa	You told your hubby that his mom's breath stinks?? Not a good idea.  I would be upset with you too.<br>  <br>  You can't really expect that your MIL won't hold the grandchild.  No, it's not her RIGHT, but she'll definitely want to.  Especially if she sees your mom holding the baby.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	I would tell her about it. If she got a problem with it that's on her. Ur baby or u shouldn't b sick. Offer her a mint if she don't take it then I guess she dnt want to hold her grandchild.|`|28QPS6V9aa	You should grow up and start acting mature, so what if she has bad breath, it's her grandbaby. She has a right to hold her own grandchild. Grow up.|`|sK67bBy5aa	HAHAHAHA!!!! Excuse me, but that is funny!<br>  <br>  Your a new mom....I did the silliest things too! I would just suck it up and let her hold the baby...for a little while!|`|eaec21d021a64de69faee82b4c03247eaa	Most likely you got sick from her breath when you were pregnant because your senses were more enhanced! Even smelling your favorite food might've made you gag! The baby will be fine. I doubt it would even think she smelled because they don't know what smells "good" or "bad". If they cried from the smell, then your MIL would most likely give the baby back. I'm hoping the newborn is still really young, because your poor mother-in-law hasn't been able to hold the baby all that time! How sad :(|`|7rCeCVl2aa	LOL! No, I don't think it will make your baby sick.<br>  <br>  I think the situation matches your screen name. =)|`|4e67Pdfvaa	offer her some gum and move on
QRXtkYrzaa	I work with 3-5 year olds and let me tell you, the 3 year olds have a concept of right and wrong. They know when they shove someone, or yell, or talk back to their teachers that it is wrong.  Now, this is only when a child is taught between right and wrong at this age.  The kids I work with know these things because they get time-out for these actions, and they know not to do it again. <br>  <br>  It depends on what kind of communication abilities you're talking about here.  If she has a delay of some sort that impedes her understanding then she may have a point. However, a healthy, on-track 5 year old is plenty old enough to understand right and wrong.|`|AA10811784	I agree with you. That is hogwash. My 3 year old already understands when she is misbehaving (and when to correct it).|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	My 2 year old misbehaves. When they know what is not right or what they should not do and they do it that is misbehaving. God it kind of bothers me when people are all OH my 11 year old just dosent know he was wrong ahhhhhh (sorry over exaggerating but still)|`|4sjW4Ig5aa	Beyond old enough. At 2 they are more than capable, not always willing, but still capable of understanding what you want from them. <br>  <br>  If her 5  yr old, lacks communication skills, that's her fault, as something should have been done about that a few years ago. <br>  <br>  Children need rules and structure in order to truly thrive. It's a scary world out there if you are small and left on your own and out of control. A 5 yr old lacks the ability to make good decisions all on their own 24/7.|`|9Zdt7E56aa	I definately think that a five year old is old enough to misbehave. They do it constantly, and they love to "test the boundaries". They can know something is wrong, and do it anyway, just to see what the consequences will be, and they do it all of the time.|`|C46DNX11aa	They know right from wrong by the time they are three or four.

Good luck!|`|hrMhhB4Saa	um, the entire day? lol. thats all my son does is crawl around and explore and play. that and eat and sleep|`|TJusfEnlaa	My son is 10 months in a couple of days, and he spends about 2 hours a day asleep and the rest of the day walking around exploring!

GGH0HVdvaa	After two years together it is pretty odd that he would feel shy around you. Maybe the two of you need to spend more time together talking about yourselves. Open up and let forth everything that each of you loves, fears, hates, prefers, etc etc. The more open you are with each other, the less fights you'll have and the less chance there is for misunderstandings.|`|AA12069058	This is not strange and actually common.

Do something more productive with your time. Adopt some children. Get a pet....<br>  <br>  ADD: OF COURSE we are critical of this. Abortion is a touchy subject and people usually feel strongly one way or another. I NEVER talk about my personal beliefs with strangers for this reason alone. I have friends that are prolife and we don't discuss how we feel because we won't change our minds...|`|LKIhUMCgaa	obviously u've never been raped before...so u need to stop talking bout it as if u know how u'd feel carrying a child of a bastard who raped u for 9 months.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Post in Ethics not in pregnancy<br>  <br>  and being raped and giving up the child is not that easy come back on here when you have been raped and pregnant from it and then tell me that.<br>  <br>  I was raped and I wanted an abortion, but i had one when i was 16 (medical reasons) and couldnt go through on again so i had the thing and gave it up for adoption and it was the worst 9 months of my life, especialy when the frigging thing started moving, it made me friggen sick, If I could go back I would aborted the damn thing insted of put myself through that hell and constant reminder of the rape.<br>  <br>  So dont tell me just get through with it and give it up for adoption<br>  <br>  <br>  and yes we are critical, your posting a question about abortion in a section with a bunch of hormonal pregnant woman,and on top of that the little comment "I understand that some where raped or w/e but get through with it and give it up for adoption" dosent help you out much either<br>  <br>  <br>  idc if i get thumbs down, bring it on<br>  <br>  DONT TELL ME TO CHILL! <br>  <br>  F@CKING MEN!

Apart from these i think it is selfish to just snub out a life or patential life!!!<br>  <br>  But this is my belief and i do feel strongly about this. I think you will get some rather harsh comments regarding your question|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Ever heard of things like ectopic pregnancy?  If an ectopic pregnancy is not terminated then the mother AND the baby die.  Why not try to save the mother's life?|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Why are you ranting about this to random people? We are a bunch of pregnant women here what's making you think we want abortions? :/|`|bo4MguzVaa	I agree.     But there are many things that have been legal that after a while have been made unlawful.  Like slavery for instance, a long time ago people thought it was their right to own people and abuse them.<br>  <br>  I even think abortion because of a rape is wrong.  And believe me I know b/c I lived it.  Just think about it...what is worse...murder or raping someone?  It's wrong to be raped and to be violated, but it's not the baby's fault.  Carry it for 9 months and give it away.  I never figured out why rape would justify murder logically speaking.  If you are gonna kill somebody, kill the rapist.  I can understand how it may make sense emotionally, but I still think it's wrong.<br>  <br>  The only abortion reason I would ever say is fine is if the mother and the baby were gonna die, so it make no sense to let them both die.  <br>  But seriously...how often does that really happen?  It's not the problem.  The problem is people thinking it's ok to kill children just becuse they don't happen to want them, for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  You are right no matter what anyone says, it's people that are obsessed with their selves who tend to disagree, or they are in denial.|`|ZWVvtIK8aa	well this is the wrong place for this questions. especially since everyone here is pregnant or has been pregnant and are not planning on killing there babies... but anyway i personally am pro choice, and tho i could never personally make that choice. i have seen lots of kids who i feel maybe would have been better off not being born at all then being basically tortured and not enjoying one minute of there lives because there mother was a meth addict or other equally dysfunctional reasons. i dunno. i just dont understand why its a big deal, its not like we are short on people. especially unloved and missed treated ones. i also think its very wrong to have gotten pregnant in the first place and have to make that decision... lol but ill shut up now|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	well, i'm not pregnant or anything, but i understand that sometimes maybe the mother cannot afford to keep the child. If the life u are bringing into the world has to suffer, cuz maybe u dont have enough food, money, etc, then its better to let it die than to have it suffer?<br>  God knows everything that goes on, and he does everything for a reason.|`|R1eten5Haa	It is an option because there are a lot of morally confused people in America, including our new Commander and Chief.

AA11418451	You should try doing things that will relax you and slow your mind.  Anything that will keep your mind awake, like reading, excercise, being on the computer, etc., will only keep you awake.  For me, I enjoy being lulled by watching a little television before I go to sleep.<br>  <br>  Perhaps try drinking some calming ginseng tea.  It relaxes your muscles (Naturally), and the soothing warmth of the tea is also very calming.<br>  <br>  You could also try 1 or 2 pieces of chocolate to relax and get some endorphins flowing.  I eat Hershey's Kisses.  They're small enough to just melt in your mouth, but just enough to get the taste.<br>  <br>  I also have a fan on when I sleep; just on low(since it's winter).  It provides a background noise to fill the quiet.  I have sensitive hearing, so even in dead quiet, I can still hear the slight mirmirs of electricity running through the house.  It's a stationary noise, so it won't distrupt or prevent me from sleeping.<br>  <br>  It's also a good idea to eliminate as much light as possible.  Perhaps you should purchase a night mask to cover your eyes.<br>  <br>  You could also try "daydreaming"; letting your mind flutter about, while you drift to sleep.<br>  <br>  Lastly, try taking deep calming breaths.  With each breath, hold it in for just a second longer.  Don't do so in a way to cause discomfort.  If it's causing discomfort, don't do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  It IS important to keep a sleep schedule, by going to bed, roughly, at the same time every day.  Otherwise, you'll throw off your body clock and will begin to sleep irradically.<br>  <br>  so to recap, try the following:<br>  - drink calming tea<br>  - have a piece of chocolate<br>  - turn on a small fan<br>  - eliminate light<br>  - daydream; let your mind wander<br>  - take deep, calming breaths<br>  <br>  I hope these will help :D|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	NyQuil:<br>  The achy head, sore throat, runny nose, how did I wake up on the kitchen floor medicine.|`|8838a1367bf15736946a9ce17cee7b59aa	okay, I do crossword puzzles.

I was lost in my early 20s. It does get better! However, you should take time to go to the gym and take care of YOU! If you take care of yourself you will feel much better and your mood will improve. Staring at a screen all day is not good!|`|abELhjcoaa	hobbies, sports, clubs and classes are good ways to change up a routine, definitely see what your local school or community center has to offer
RwoN3E9Uaa	We did BLW too, make sure to just offer only 1-2 "meals" a day of solids until 10 months or so.  If you wish to continue to BF past a year than at a year only about 25% of their calories should come from solids.  Elyse isn't much of an eater so we do 3 "meals" with her but she doesn't eat more than a few bites at each meal.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Hi! It sounds pretty normal. My guy is 9 months now, and he's starting to eat more and more solids. I find myself nursing him less frequently than before, but still plenty to give him his nutrients. I nurse regularly before naps and bedtime, and after he eats in place of juice.<br>  <br>  Try to feed him breast milk instead of juices, and keep nursing before his nappies and bedtime, and he'll be getting plenty!<br>  <br>  Have fun washing all those bibs, and clothes and the floor - don't we love our little eaters!|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	How many times a day is he nursing?  I think the minimum is 4-5 at this age, although I honestly can't remember.  Plus, my kids all nursed at least 6-8 times per day up until their first birthdays.<br>  <br>  I don't know how often you're giving him solids, but you may want to limit it to 2 meals per day so that he continues to breastfeed more frequently.  I don't think I added a third meal for my kids until around 10 months, and that seemed to work pretty well.  If he really wants to eat solids more often, you could always give him some frozen breastmilk as a "slushie" or put it in a sippy for him to drink with his food.<br>  <br>  I think that as long as you continue to offer to nurse frequently throughout the day, he'll be just fine.|`|7rIAd6gGaa	I always nursed my daughter, and then offered her solids about an hour later. That way she got just about as much milk as she usually would - It had been 2 hours since she'd eaten anything. It's a good thing that he's taken to the food so well, by the way. The next 3 months should be sort of a transition time, because once he's a year you really want to be sure he's eating plenty of solids.<br>  <br>  As for your supply, if you're concerned that it's getting low, you could try taking fenugreek. I think you can get it in a tea form, but I'm not positive. It's a herb that is supposed to increase your supply. I have several friends who swear by it. (I never had to try it because I had the opposite problem - way too much milk!) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4e67Pdfvaa	how old is he?<br>  If the baby is older it SHOULD like food more than breastmilk.

We just keep them in a drawer and they decide which they feel like wearing. The older one tends to go for bikinis, the younger one goes for whichever suit is most pink. They're just little girls. We don't buy anything overly sexy I don't think, and we buy their clothes alone (don't ask their opinions). Some kids do show too much though, depends on the age.<br>  <br>  Last year we were at a local park that has water features and the girls were playing. Well there was this older girl there (probably 12-14 or so) and she stripped right there to change back into her real clothes. Someone needed to tell her not to because she obviously lacked modesty. I never would have done that at that age! And she was starting to develop too, not a little kid anymore.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, I'd buy one pieces for little ones, but when they get to be 7 or 8 I'd let them wear a tankini, unless they were still happy with the one pieces.

In that case, you are still a public school student, you just do your lessons from home via a computer.

4xsAQBZuaa	Yep the more she grows the more natural oils will be lost and the weight of the hair lifts making curly hair, length will bring weight to hair and help keep it straight. was she born with full head of hair, if so then she may be recovering from loss of hair causing fuzzes and will go away with growth, if born bald then it takes longer from them to grow in that beautiful head of hair we all keep hoping for.  Can use baby lotion on her hair to help give it wait to keep it straight, rub a bit on your hands and slide hands over hair, also try friz-eez,  do try to limit brushing when wet but realistically even as an adult we all know that this is hard to accomplish.  My own personal input is to let the hair be so it can start growing in a natural pattern and faster so you get a better understanding of hair, which yes probably does curl up again when sleeping due to heat and sweat,  people are going to look at your child's eyes, her soul,  and manners to decide if she is beautiful or not, not her hair.|`|117abff9116e3a46733b70216ee24e7aaa	I dont brush it after her bath but I spray detangler n it before she goes to bed and n the morning it looks normal not frizzy. Alot of depends what kind of shampoo u use to|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Pretty normal, same is true for me and my son - and wetting it is different then soaking it with a shower.   Why bother making it straight?   I'd let it be curly if I were you, it's a whole lot less frustrating.
p7ZdohGTaa	Is it still like this? If it has gone away, you are probably O.K., but if only one leg is swollen and your OB is not helping, then call your regular doctor. There are serious things that can cause only one leg to swell and you need to discuss this with a doctor, right away. <br>  See:<br>  <a href="http://www.lymphedemapeople.com/thesite/leg_swelling.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lymphedemapeople.com/thesite/...</a><br>  My daughter had one leg swell and it was found she had a blood clot in her leg. This is very uncommon, but you should always check with your doctor. I don't know the causes during pregnancy, since I never had this. Ask your doctor, again, if the leg is still swollen.|`|byGHdJIzaa	When I am sitting in my recliner and I fall asleep, the foot that is on the floor will swell real bad too.(I usually tuck my left foot under my right thigh and rock myself with my right foot on the ground) Since I've stopped doing that I don't swell, sometimes I forget though. It's not much to worry about every pregnancy is different. You are getting so close to 40 weeks you are probably just retaining extra fluid, just try to keep comfy and don't sit for long periods of time. Get up and walk to the bathroom a couple of times every 30 minutes or so to keep your circulation going good. Hope I have helped and I wish you a wonderful delivery.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Hmm, could just be an odd form of water retention. Or you maybe hurt it and didn't know. With only 2 weeks to your due date I wouldnt worry it will probably go away on its own.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Listen to your doctor. If it gets worse call him back but he's most likely right...|`|duinadV4aa	if your doc didn't know i sure don't
nFj30sZcaa	I like the combination, but I think Vivianne Elaine would be nicer.<br>  Something to consider is that the endings of both names sound similar and both end with -ne. It seems kind of matchy or rhymey. .|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Wow! I love them both.I never thought to put them together.But, that is great!|`|EFzXvfbQaa	I LOVE VIVIENNE hate Elaine|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't care for it, sorry.|`|8WbfmK5daa	It flows really nicely together.<br>  <br>  Vivienne is a beautiful name. Personally Im not crazy about the name Elaine but they work together.<br>  <br>  Its a beautiful but solid name can't go wrong :)|`|smrCnOITaa	That's A Beautiful Name .<br>  ???<br>  - Clair|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	very nice|`|UquxJBwVaa	i dont really like either name. sorry.|`|XkWTsyJdaa	i LOVE the name vivienne. but i dont care for elaine. it sounds very grandma-ish.|`|34VXCyvVaa	Yes, it's very nice.
rkSBHqtQaa	I know exactly how you feel. I have a 2 year old that barely eats anything. I've tried pretty much everything and he still barely eats. I've tried his favorite foods, giving him what he wants and nothing. I also took him to his pediatrician and I was told he was fine. Its just a phase that he's going through. The picky eater phase. He did recomend I give him vitamins, that way he's at least getting his nutrients from somewhere. he also said that as long as he's drinkoing enough fluids he should be ok. Good luck with him and hope I helped. :)|`|OXccUjTwaa	MY 1 year old does that sometimes too. Sometimes its normal. Sometimes its not. It depends on the kid really. GOOD LUCK!!!!!|`|P1xlrvAaaa	Keep in mind that his stomach is only as big as his little fist.He won't starve his self and he will eat when he is hungry.Good luck!|`|0GqYeMVWaa	im a mommy.....they rarely ever starve themselves......kids eat what they need,when they need it..if he was hungry he would it.......he must just like grazing.....not all adults eat like horses either....good luck hun|`|Qo6UWVaeaa	my daughter did this to. but i would give her bottles all through the day and i think that would fill her up so when it was time to eat she would only take a few bites and be done.<br>  your child wont starve him self.<br>  he eats what he needs. but if your worried ask the doctor about it.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	Keep in mind that a portion to a 1 yr old is much smaller then an adult portion.  I remember asking the doctor about this very same thing when my 18 yr old was around 12 months.  He took out a little medicine cup and said - this is about 3 ounces - a nice size portion for a small child - compared to 1/2 cup that an adult would consider normal (then he added that adults often nearly double portion sizes so child size seems even smaller)<br>  <br>  Don't worry as long as he is not eating junk in place of "good" foods.
ADjeuxIiaa	The doctors told me I had been in labor for 2 full days before I had my son. I didn't even know it. No real contractions or any other signs. The only symptom I had was a severe back ache.
eemmWU0Haa	why didn't you do it yourself?...that's what my twin sister did for her friend when it was her baby shower cost way less!
R1eten5Haa	Walk. Walk. Walk. Go to walmart or the mall or something. Walk for about 30 minutes, rest for 10, then do it again. Try drinking Red Raspberry Leaf tea, about a cup an hour. Eat pineapple too. It helps the cervix efface. Most importantly though, is that baby will come when it is ready. All of my labors have been prolonged like that. I would sit on 4cm for 2 weeks straight, then I'd hit labor hard, push for 30 minutes, and baby would be there before I knew it!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	No you wont be pregnant forever bc eventually they will have to induce you lol gives you some hope I hope lol. I dont know I have heard lots of sex and rough sex if you can stand it. Many women have told me that rough sex had thrown them into labor. Good luck|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	go walking!! not too far from home, but WALK...|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Oh wow, I saw that you were having contractions every ten minutes and I thought "well then hang on your almost done"<br>  Then I saw "...for two days..." And I thought "HOLY COW THAT SUCKS!!!!"<br>  <br>  I would try to go for a long walk, if you have a treadmill then that is best because you dont have to go far away from home.<br>  Walk for HOURS and HOURS though.|`|6mr4OjQjaa	Hardcore sex|`|7rIAd6gGaa	Wow. I feel for you. My daughter was 9 days late and it was torture. It sounds like you should really be going any minute now. You actually scared me that I could be that dilated and all and have nothing happen! You must be so frustrated.<br>  <br>  Once I thought labor was approaching (I had 2 Braxton Hicks over the course of the day that I also felt in my back), I tried sex, and my real contractions started about 20 minutes later. My cousin just had her baby, and she was late, so they were trying everything too. She had sex and held her legs up in the air for 20 min to let the sperm really get in there. LOL. She went into labor about an hour later. Maybe a coincidence, but you could give it a shot!<br>  <br>  None of the other things I tried worked. And I wouldn't want to try castor oil either. I'm not sure what else to tell you, but I wish you luck!!! I'm sending you lots of labor vibes. :)|`|SSM3u4l4aa	I know exactly how it feels to be overdue. I was overdue one week to the day that I had my baby girl. <br>  It might just not be time for the baby to come.. you could go into labor now.. or now.. or later.. or tomorrow! It could happen any minute.. quite literally. <br>  Orgasm might help to trigger contractions. I am not trying to be nasty here but a good orgasm- a deep one includes uterine contractions. It is not only sperm that helps to induce labor- it is your orgasm from the sex.<br>  <br>  I would wait for labor to start and until it happens.. RELAX as much as you can. If this is your first baby you will need as much rest as you can get. <br>  <br>  Best of luck with the new baby.|`|OhYE3GhKaa	You know it won't be much longer. You already went through all those months. Yes, my friend was seriously over due with a child and she was feeling pretty desperate, but the baby came, naturally.<br>  <br>  You just have to keep close to the doctor so they can make sure the baby is still getting what it needs Kathleen|`|wK4kqhHkaa	Get a foot massage.  Supposedly some reflexology points in your feet can bring on labor.   2 of my friends use to work in beauty salons and they said quite a few women who had had foot massages went into labor very shortly after.  Pregnant forever- no  but maybe for another week.  Good luck
2F5HNPqPaa	To other answerers:  "Tea" is what we call "dinner" over here in UK... as in a meal at 5pmish.<br>  <br>  Also, you can actually give babies herbal teas (like fennel).  Obviously normal tea is a bad idea due to caffeine.  <br>  <br>  And to answer your question, he is obviously on the small side.  My son is 6 months and about 19lbs!  He was 8lb 4oz at birth.  (Though mine is big for his age!)  I also know a baby who is 8 months and around 15lbs last time I spoke to her mum... she's very cute!  I'd say you have no reason to worry as long as he's still gaining weight, however slowly.  Just keep persisting!  Also bear in mind if he's crawling and trying to walk he's probably burning up as much as he's eating... some babies even stop gaining for a few weeks once they're mobile.|`|ddP3klT3aa	He drinks tea? Is that safe? I would be worried, honestly. Forget the health visitor, take him to a dr if you haven't. At 6 months my son was 17.12 pounds.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I am going to assume this is an English thing to do. You should not give a baby tea. Regular tea has lots of caffeine. Decaf still does have some as well. I'm surprised a baby would even like tea. Hopefully you wouldn't be sweetening it especially with honey. That's a no-no because of botulism. You could try juice. Another fattening (but in a good way) food is avocado.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	Umm when does he drink tea? I would never give my son tea only formula. Well at 6 months old my son weighed 18 pounds he was 9 pounds 2 ounces at birth.|`|03Y7DMdiaa	awh...they are scary little things arnt they. I would suggest you go to the doctors and talk through your worries. He does sound very small if hes in 0-3 and 3-6 month clothes, but he may just be a small baby. Is he putting on weight every month? Try giving him food thats high in fat to put on some weight...you say hes walking at 8 months (thats very early) perhaps hes burning off all the fat his body makes?!<br>   Please dont worry...just make sure you dont let it lie until YOUR happy with his weight and growth. Remember babies pick up on how their mummys are feeling and if he picks up theres a problem with food then he may reject it. My daughter also was on Nutramigen milk after months of me telling the docs that i was SURE she was allergic to cows milk and them ignoring me! Just be persistant with getting help and advice! I believe we worry about our cchildren until there at least 30!! (or so my mum tells me!!) x
pzLDXL6gaa	There are lots of different situations out there...if he's texting every 2 days to see how you're doing then at least he has some level of interest and this may increase as things progress. Unless you think he's just checking if you had an abortion or whatever. If you guys aren't together, if he wants to be involved he should be checking how you are, helping you if necessary in the later stages, and then being there for whatever is decided regarding him spending time with the baby. You should seek child support when the child is born. If you want an abortion, then it's your choice, not his, so do it if you want. Good luck.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AA10927320	dont expect much im 27 weeks pregnant and have been living with the father 3 yrs before we got pregnant and to be honest he gets annoyed to feel the baby move at my ultra sound we had a fight cuz i asked if i could have a rocking chair and i went in alone while he left me there bymyself  and then um he just gets macuz im constantly peeing or something makes fun of my belly  and when im swelling or my hips are hurting cuz if ur small framed and u get pg ur hips kinda like strech out and it hurts  anyways he feels no compasion for me oh and  i dont work so when i need a new bra for my way bigger boobs or maternity clothes he gets so mad for me buying them  and end up going to walmart to get my stuff <br>  <br>  so yeah i guess its a guy thing for guys like 20- 35 cuz mines 31 and hasnt grown up yet|`|IoWoDxG8aa	Well the fact that he is showing you that he cares at all and wants to keep the baby is better than a man who doesn't even talk to you!! It is still early. I think that once he sees that you are preggo with a tummy and everything he will do better. <br>  If it bothers you and you want him around more, maybe you should talk to him about it. He prolly doesn't even realize what he is doing, or worse, maybe he thinks that YOU want your distance. The more communication the better esp if you guys are gonna have a baby together. BTW, I am pregnant and my BF texts me and doesn't call. But he hates calling and talking on the phone. Texts aren't anything nowadays...they are just the same as calling esp to our younger generation.|`|XkWTsyJdaa	he should be checking up everyday. and be helping u w. everything and doing/getting watever u need. having a baby should be ur decision, not his totally. and seriously, if ur not even together, he should be really thank ful ur keeping it. idk wat to say. if i were u, i wouldve gotten the abortion or give it up for adoption.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Keep the baby , call him and tell him how you are feeling though because its not polite he doesnt call you and its not fair if y ou take his baby away from him either.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	To be honest I wouldn't be expecting too much at this point. You aren't together anymore, and obviously don't see each other regularly.<br>  My husband didn't start getting anxious about checking on me etc. until I got to about 24 weeks and started looking really pregnant, and we live together!<br>  Men tend to put these things into the back of their mind until they can actually see the effects of the pregnancy (namely the big tummy lol) so don't be suprised. It happens even with couples that are still together.<br>  If he's the one that wants to keep the baby and he knows that you're considering aborting then I find it suprising that he's not at least calling you once or twice a week to see how things are going, you are carrying a child that you aren't certain about keeping after all. But that being said... Men are men when it comes to pregnancy. It's all a bit of a mystery to them and can be ignored for a large part which if he's like any normal man he'll do for as long as he can because it's a massive change in your life. Women have the physical effects and therefore can't ignore it for any part... Lucky us! Lol.<br>  <br>  Perhaps let him know how you're feeling and explain that you don't feel supported, and that if he can't make more of a commitment then you'll do what you feel is necassary. But at the same time don't expect him to become super-dad instantly. It's a huge adjustment for any man, whether in a happy relationship or seperated by distance and single.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope things get easier for you :)|`|zlciavc1aa	Well if he communicates through txt, you shouldn't expect much during the pregnancy and maybe after delivery. Every man is different so there is no way on how we can tell you how much should he check up on you. you know him better than us.. but i personally wouldn't expect much, to only be disappointed later.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Well, only you can answer that, but if you're not together anymore and he's in the marines, I'd say he's doing pretty well to check on you every 2 days! I think once every week or two would be fine.|`|pq2q0upuaa	please don't have an abortion! but the fact of the matter is he does check on you, and ur only 4 and 1/2 weeks maybe later on in the pregnancy he should check on you more. good luck and please don't abort the gift god blessed you with!|`|35kVNi5oaa	Don't get an abortion, it's not worth it.
49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	I prefer to shop at A.J. Wright and Marshalls.  They have all the name brands, brand new clothing for up to 70% off what you would pay at the mall stores.  The clothes there are perfect, in style brands.  I have three children, with my youngest being six.  For him I spent about $200 at the start of the school year on his clothing.  Our school district is good with supplies so he did not need anything except a back pack which was about $15 and a lunch box which was about $8.  His school just asks that each parent donate an item a few times in the year like tissues, hand sanatizer, cleaning wipes, etc.|`|viGqMW1Xaa	well i have a very tall third grade and his clothes are much more expensive than my younger kids. i like him to look the best in nice, semi expensive clothes.|`|FiUprYsvaa	I would spend a couple hundred on school clothes at the beginning of the school year.<br>  And I would shop at the mall for them. PacSun and whatever other store carried those brands. <br>  <br>  Then I would get her more at christmas.<br>  <br>  And then get more for spring.|`|j3wown0oaa	I usually spend about $200 to $300 at the beginning of the school year and then again when spring starts.  I buy stuff off season and save it for later in the year.  You save a ton.  I just spent $120 at Dillard's, got all name brands, 11 items, for my son for next winter.  I've already got a bin full of stuff for the summer.  Happy Shopping|`|tBtOTiQDaa	$50<br>  walmart<br>  if she wants more, then she can buy it|`|KSK22vHUaa	I was raised by a single mother who made very little money so we shopped Old Navy sales, thrift shops, TG MAXX...  I never really missed that stuff though.  I could get new things as I needed them but my mom has mentioned she saved $100 for the start of each school year and that's all I got, unless I seriously outgrew everything.  My grandmother would help out and buy me things sometimes too--probably when we were really broke.<br>  <br>  I'm 21 now, so this isn't so long ago.  Considering her age, being obsessed with name brands is probably going to get worse.  Shop online.  Again, considering her age, there's probably tons of stuff on ebay in her size from girls who have outgrown it.  <br>  <br>  You're the adult, though, and it's your money.  If it's too expensive for you, stop buying it.  There's nothing wrong with the other clothes, or clothes on sale, or clothes from the thrift shop.  And she can save her allowance if it's really that important for her to have such-and-such brand of whatever.|`|HSB3BMqcaa	120 bucks for clothes, 30 on accessereies, 0 for shoes(make dad pay)<br>  or cheaper<br>  <br>  <br>  clairs, rainbow, rave, dots, mall<br>  <br>  every fit thown, secrtly take of 5 bucks|`|lWGaYxAbaa	You would probably spend around 200$ <br>  <br>  Stores: Pac Sun; Vanity;forever 21;ambercrombie <br>  <br>  HAVE FUN SHOPPING!!|`|Ks3iQayaaa	deff pacsun.<br>  that has all those brands.<br>  <br>  maybe delias and wetseal.|`|PKmUiJC2aa	100 dollars at most.

0DtWgXxUaa	Baby will have brown eyes, and probably strawberry-blondey hair. Or, it could end up red. Or, just blonde. With those colours, it's like a lottery. <br>  xx|`|6YqjaVOvaa	It depends if any of your grand or great-grand parents had red hair.  If not the chance are the same as winning the pick 3 lottery.|`|YP3rEESUaa	well most likely the baby would have brown eyes and and prob. have the same redish blond hair as your husband.|`|fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	chances are very high that the baby would have red hair...|`|yV8fog7Paa	a dirty blondish hair probably blue eyes?|`|mhp7JKMNaa	Well, it won't be the average of color LOL between you and your husband. Your baby will aquire certain genes from each parents. Your baby could also have the color hair of an ancestor of yours 0.o like a grandpa. Just all depends, you won't be able to know until your baby is born. The color of hair/eyes could also change from the genes changing inside your baby's body.
obN6p3Cgaa	Congrats! take the offer baby take money so go for it..........|`|S3XT8UtYaa	NEVER turn down a promotion unless you have a very good reason for it.  Babies take a lot of time in the beginning, but as they get older, it gets easier.
U1ku2k4Naa	That seems reasonable.  You failed to do your project because of lack of organization, or procrastination.  You disobeyed your parents.  Three weeks is nothing, my friend was once grounded for an entire year!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You are lucky. If you lived at my house you would have lost more than driving privileges and for longer than three weeks. You lied, skipped school and failed to take care of your school work. All unacceptable|`|FiUprYsvaa	If your mom said you could stay home Monday you shouldn't be punished for Monday.<br>  <br>  And I think 3 weeks is too long, maybe a week because you were doing school work.|`|c2IqfXVfaa	very reasonable.<br>  <br>  listen to your parents & don't mess up next time.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	Sounds fair to me. You shouldn't ever skip school.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	It seems fair to me. First off, not finishing an assignment is not a valid reason to not go to school. Second, perhaps your mom approved the first day, but you still skipped two days without permission. You were technically truant, not only a violation of your parents' rules, but a violation of the law. You need to take the bus or deal with your parents driving you to and from school and learn from the experience.|`|38193506d53dade90585f207e6844e75aa	I think it's VERY reasonable.<br>  <br>  You broke the rules because you had failed to do something you should have done before the day it was due so you get punished.<br>  <br>  Even if your mom said you could skip Monday she didn't say you could skip Tuesday or Wednesday.<br>  <br>  Get over it and accept the consequences of your actions.|`|jV1Ma10jaa	i think this is a somewhat acceptable punishment.... if you go to public school well at least where i live this shows up on your school record... not good... but if you go to a private school you could get severe punishments no matter what the excuse is<br>  so i think the punishment is a little bit long... just get a ride from one of your friends!|`|wqRwSaGSaa	i think its very reasonable.<br>  dont skip school<br>  i would have gotten them takin away for alot longer.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Myabe you shouldnt have skipped.<br>  And asked the teacher for more days?|`|1gVDZrPuaa	Well if you have to go somewhere, they have to stop what they are doing to take you and I'm sure that would get on their nerves.  Tell him that.
kQSSz2X2aa	Yes, if you had sex she could be pregnant. Sometimes when an embryo implants there is some bleeding that occurs. However, this bleeding is sometimes mistaken as a period. She needs to take a pregnancy test to determine if she is pregnant.|`|FUNhlpiqaa	With my second, I had what I thought a period, but it turned out I was pregnant.  Anything is possible.  Wear protection.|`|y5sWmbtnaa	My sister claims that this is when she DID get pregnant.|`|uernsxWpaa	no
ADjeuxIiaa	Not at all! I didn't even start showing with my first baby until I was about 6 months (and for the record i maintained an average weight of 125lbs for most of my pregnancy) But after 6 months, my baby grew fast. I was a little bigger by 7 months. Bigger by 8, and by 9 months my stomach was almost the size of a basketball! I gave birth to a healthy 7lb 2oz baby boy though. So I wouldn't worry. If your OB is saying all is well, then put your feet up and enjoy some oreos!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it's just the way she's laying in ur stomach. my belly isn't very big either and i'm having a girl. she's laying sideways and more in my waist instead of sticking out.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I wouldn't worry, especially if your doctors are not concerned. Are they taking measurements? If not, maybe you could ask them to and that may ease your mind a bit. Everyone carries a bit differently and is shaped differently so that could be the issue here. :]|`|YP3rEESUaa	it could just be because you have the room for her. are you tall? of have a long abdomen?  I had a friend that is tall and when she was around 7 months she only looked like she was 4-5 months, and that was because she was taller.  I wouldn't be worried though, the Dr. said shes fine and healthy.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	No why? Be happy that you arent that big yet, the bigger you get the more uncomfortable you are, trust me :) All women are different and we grow in different ways and at different times. The more kids you have the bigger you will get with each pregnancy too. Good luck and congrats on the babe|`|khSCs1rbaa	I was the same but my tummy ballooned in the last month. Your doctor had given you his assurance. Good luck for the rest of the pregnancy|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Alot of people were telling me I was small too when I was pregnant. As long as your baby is keeping up with her weight shes fine|`|35kVNi5oaa	It may they way she is sitting in there. :]|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Listen to your doctors
gW0nD5cEaa	There is a problem, I'm sure, but I can't diagnose anything, I'm not a doctor, and even a doctor on here could not really say.<br>  <br>  He needs some help, and no doubt his mother needs help in trying to cope with him. If he won't even talk to his own siblings or try to communicate there is something not right. Other kids, outsiders, there still would be but that could be shyness.<br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out OK and I hope the Mom is willing to have him checked.|`|3bahzW9Uaa	Confused here as well.  Does he say mamama to his mother to get her attention or does he just say only mamama to indicate any want/need.  <br>  <br>  To guess if this child has autism based on what you said would be quite inappropriate.  He does appear to have speech delays though, and that alone would qualify him for early intervention.  I'd find out about your area services and contacts.  You can call your local school district special education department and ask who to call about early intervention services.  A pediatricians office should also be able to give you the number.  Call and ask about what type of services would be offered for a child fitting her son's discription. Some areas offer free services for birth to three, then the school district takes over.  Other areas charge on a sliding scale.  My son was speech delayed and offered speech therapy, and an early intervention "preschool" a few days a week, all free of charge.   You do not need a doctor's referral to early intervention. You can self refer. <br>  <br>  Maybe start a conversation about kids, mention her son's lack of speech and ask if she knew that they offered xxxxxx  for children with speech delays.  If there are other issues, such as autism, it will be picked up on rather quickly, and addressed by the professionals with the parent.|`|X4WRMvGqaa	There could be a problem but it is hard to tell. <br>  I would suggest she take him to get an early evaluation. Early intervention is the key if he does have autism. <br>  The doctor will observe, take a history etc. <br>  I am confused though. He does not talk except "Mamama" and will only do that to his mom or or he will only "mamama" to others but speak sentences to his mom. <br>  Either way, I would suggest she take him for testing and the sooner the better.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	It could be anything really.The fact that he even speaks to his  reassuring in the fact that he probably doesn't have autism.His social skills are probably SEVERELY lacking bc he does stay home with mom all day everyday and most likely doesn't have much interaction with children his own age.He probably also has some sensory issues as well.His mother should set up play dates for him,try to take him out more,try to leave him with others (even if only for as few minutes) sometimes it is not always the child but rather the parent!|`|0GqYeMVWaa	he doesnt sound quite right does he......dont tell her...moms who are in denial will not react quite how you imagine them to.they will just think you are being mean.she must know that something is wrong and eventually he will goto kindergarten and probably be slung out for being violent or something...you will lose a friendship if you tell her...trust me....let the proffessionals work it out.|`|OXccUjTwaa	Its possible. I know someone like that. Its kinda the same like that, but he doesn't talk at all. I think u should try to break it to the mom the best way you can.
ntdGOZqGaa	Could be you are going into labor...I would give the doc a call just to see what they say, but constant pain, with puking and being dizzy sounds like labor to me. Hope this helps
8udo6hImaa	ask your pediatrician to prescribe  TRIAMCINOLONE ACETONIDE  my son had really bad eczema and it helped alot.. it started going away within the first week but it has to be prescribed!! <br>  <br>  just grease your baby up before bedtime and cover with clothing to help it soak into skin.. <br>  <br>  it is a fungus cream so if your doctor tells you dont freak out but its absolutely amazing!!|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	She might need something stronger than you can get over the counter.  Two of my children have gotten eczema many times in thier lives.  Thier pediatrician has prescribed two things for it: A cream called Elidel and another cream a little stronger called Triamcinolone Acetonide.  These help well, but are not for extended use.  She said once it clears up to use plain old fashioned Vaseline.  That is what is supposed to be best.  Also try a different cleanser like Cetaphil or Dove.|`|0ky4TktEaa	Have you taken her to the doctor? She may have the kind of eczema that will never go away 100%. My little sister has is bad and it's been a problem since at least a year old. CRAZY itch attacks. In her case, alot of it's just her not taking the time to keep it under control.<br>  <br>  Take her to the doctor. Get her officially diagnosed. They may write you a prescription for an itch cream. Before you do that though, you may want to try the ones on the shelf in the drug store. Because of how young she is though, you may want to just go with what the doctor says; over the counter stuff isn't always labeled for kids under 2. <br>  <br>  Just know you may never be able to get rid of it. Just do what you can to keep it under control. Limit the things that trigger it (prolonged sun exposure, excess sweating, lotions and soaps with dyes and fragrances, certain fabrics such as ramie and polyester. If you use hair products in her hair at all, stick to bare minimum.)|`|1MEnCmwoaa	If you can find someone who sells it or you can buy it on ebay Melaluca lotion called Renew works really well. <br>  <a href="http://www.melaleuca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.melaleuca.com/</a><br>  this is the site <br>  My neighbors daughter has excema and she says it helps a lot. My daughter also has dry skin and this helps her. <br>  Other than that ask her Dr.|`|2JaqL91Baa	If she is 17 months old, the child's doctor should be involved.  Children under two years of age should not be treated with over-the-counter treatments.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, I recommend less baths than normal and avoid soap that dries out the skin.|`|yGgFvd2Haa	ask  the  doctor|`|y8xaI8jPaa	calamine lotion, or a bath with sulpher powder in it.|`|117abff9116e3a46733b70216ee24e7aaa	I use aveeno dry skin wash 4 babies and that helps alot. I use the lotion cepahill and a skin rash cream from the doctor. Alot of time it might be something there eating like eggs or even milk.|`|A5XuZ3pIaa	I have eczema on my arms, I take oatmeal baths to help.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You can't try lotions and expect them to work, you want thick greasy stuff like Vaseline, Aquaphor, Eucerin, and even Crisco (what my cousin who is a nurse uses as it's cheap and naturally non-toxic) Cetaphil works for my boy's skin needs too.   A luke warm bath every night or so, with bath salts/water softeners in it followed by over the counter hydrocortisone and then a thick lathering of grease works the best and has kept my kids from having all over eczema to a few spots on their hands and feet.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	my friend found out by accident that putting some dandruff shampoo in her son's bath helps with his eczema itching. I guess he grabbed the bottle of shampoo and poured some in one day, and she noticed that it helped quite a bit. Her son is 3.5 years old.
iZfHSwi3aa	I think you need to take her back to the doctor.  It sounds like the yeast is resistant to whatever fungicide she prescribed the first time.  Either that, or it's a different type of infection.  <br>  <br>  Since it is only Saturday evening, you may wish to call the doctor since your niece is in so much pain.  If you don't want to do that, consider taking her into an urgent care or after hours clinic.|`|Gsa0X2yuaa	Believe it but my nephew constantly got yeast infections also. To find ot that it was the formula he was on and that he was having a reaction to the cream. there can be many reasons for any yeast infection!|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I think she meant WIPE, not WHIP!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Do another course of yeast infection cream (under the counsel of your physician).  Sometimes those infections are hard to clear up.  Make sure you keep the area clean.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	When you had to whip her? What is that supposed to mean?<br>  <br>  But, to answer your question. It may be the cream they prescribed, i would go back and see what they can do and make sure it's a yeast infection...because it may be something else. I would take her into urgent care as soon as you can.
hl5WdXnbaa	I have on my left wrist a tattoo of a lily that has the latitude and longitude of were my kids were born , designed in it.

0BrVE2nvaa	By all means call him, but keep it casual.  Just buddies at the moment.<br>  <br>  Oh, and for future reference, breaking up with someone and saying that it won't be forever, and that you'll be back together eventually, is usually a BAD IDEA! Unfortunately most of us can't see into the future, so we never know what's going to happen.|`|AA12069058	Theres nothing wrong with that.Follow your heart ?
3t9jZ89Oaa	If you want a child and can support one then do it.  I almost waited too long because we weren't "sure".  You'll never be absolutely sure - men in particular (sorry to the guys but it's true) - because there's always something to worry about.<br>  Sounds like your Mom had a lot of negative impact/influence on you already.  Do you really want her influence determining whether you have a kid?  There is a ton of info and support out there for parents, plus your husband has experience, I would imagine.  I would also imagine that you have a friend or two who has a kid or two.  Watching a child come into and discover the world is a magical gift.  Don't cheat yourself, or the child you could have.|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	U and ur husband and tell him how u feel. It's nothing wrong with wanting ur own children. Just see what he says and if he is with it then go for it. Gd luck.|`|gdCqKl89aa	Don't do it until you want it...you will know when the time is right, if ever! Trust your instincts...because that is what being a good mother is all about.|`|tFqgSpLxaa	thats something you and your husband should discuss, no one here can answer that for you.|`|E6CShQfKaa	If your husband is older then the chances of birth defects rises. If there are already 4 kids to support how can you and your husband give attention and love to 5 kids? Not everyone who doesn't get along with their parents is a bad parent themselves, some are wonderful! I feel that if you are asking this question then you are not ready.|`|3rda58OCaa	If you guys are financially stable enough to support a child then yes!  I LOVE being a mom!  It is the greatest thing in the world!  Don't worry about your mom, you can learn from her mistakes!  Always put your baby first and you will be a great mom.  All moms make mistakes, forgive yourself and do better next.
BCD3Xo6faa	if you have a typical 28 day cycle it could be implantation. I hope you get a good result. Baby dust!
4u5xD1Araa	wait until you know for sure. there is no point in telling your mom and having her all worked up for nothing. <br>  <br>  Don't tell your mom when your family is in town. she is properly stressed out as she is making sure the house is clean. wait until you have a postive.- go to the doctors<br>  <br>  you can either do that and wait til you know for sure or tell her after the family leaves a day or too and say that you may be pregnant but you are pretty sure you are. <br>  <br>  its your body and you are the one that will have the baby-don't let your boyfriend push you into telling your mom when you are not ready. but i would do it soon rather than later so you can take about the choices you have. <br>  <br>  also maybe have a plan- are you going to keep the baby, give it up for adoption or aporation. <br>  <br>  think about it then sit down with you just you and your mom then talk it over with your boyfriend and if you dad is involved as well. <br>  <br>  i hope everything goes well.|`|98WKYtfwaa	The faint test was a positive, it doesn't matter if the line isn't as dark as it should be, as long as it appears then you're pregnant. There is no such thing as a false positive, unless the test was faulty but usually the control window line wouldn't appear if that was the case.<br>  <br>  You should tell your mom about it, i think you're definitely pregnant 100%. If you're still unsure you could always tell her but tell her that your test was faint so you want a blood test confirmation before anyone else knows.|`|IoWoDxG8aa	I would wait till I knew for sure.|`|klTgOEcpaa	I would wait till I got a blood test|`|ebCzRLw7aa	Even if it was faint, your still pregnant.<br>  there is no such thing as a false positive!<br>  And mine was faint to.. im now 7 months pregnant.|`|duinadV4aa	yeah wait tell you know for sure go to the doc and make sure
coVZ1uqCaa	Yes, I do. My cousin's name is Katrina.<br>  Plus, there's a bonus. Katrina isn't a name that would get your child<br>  teased throughout her school years, but isn't too common either. <br>  There are also a lot of nicknames your daughter can go by, like :<br>  <br>  - Kate.<br>  - Katie or Katy.<br>  - Kat ; this is what my cousin goes by.<br>  - Kit-Kat.<br>  - Trina.<br>  - Rina.<br>  - Kt. <br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  -----|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Yes it is a pretty name.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	Yes, :)<br>  I love the name Katrina <br>  There can be many nick-names for it to<br>  <br>  Kitty Kat ;)<br>  Trina<br>  Treen Treen<br>  Kat<br>  <br>  LMFAO <br>  :) ?|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	I love Katrina. <br>  <br>  I know a girl with that name and she is really sweet and cute ;) <br>  <br>  It also has nice nickname options -- Katie, Kat, Kitty, Trina etc.|`|lxR9zlxbaa	yeahhhh!!!! love it|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't care for it, sorry.|`|nCIVIIJXaa	No I don't, sorry :(|`|vdVVZiY6aa	Yes, it is a good name for all ages=]|`|MDgVPwU3aa	It's ok, Kat sounds cute

Maybe I've assumed it's a toll and ignored??  i don't know.|`|rBq189W1aa	What the hell?|`|tBtOTiQDaa	meh, i don't really like spike-x after seeing his stance on drugs, and pre-maritial sex, but other than that, his answers are good|`|pJbuA5Moaa	What the f*ck are you smoking and can I have some!!!
WWcaKZ7Qaa	Well if you read it correctly, and it was a faint positive, that is still a positive and you are/were indeed pregnant. Light cramping that is similar to menstrual cramping happens for most women in early pregnancy. Before I found out I was pregnant I would have insisted I was getting my period because of the menstrual-like cramps. Perhaps you should try another home HPT since you got a faint positive on one or you could just wait for the blood test. Good luck.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	yes, i did. I actually thought I was going to start my period, so I never took the pregnancy test. Until I kept cramping. Postive I'm due in August.|`|MQ83HGD5aa	Its more likely to get a false negative than a positive. A faint line is a line! Wait a few more days and take another one, use your first morning's urine. You will cramp like period like cramps when you are pregnant. I did!|`|AztPvbauaa	yes.when i first got pregnant i had a lot of cramps.actually thought it was my period coming.but later on realised i was pregnant.so it could be.well just wait until you see your doctor.good luck.|`|AA10153923	I would bet that your are positive, no matter how faint the line is. <br>  If you took a digital one they sometimes need more tie to give you a positive.|`|x9FienLUaa	yep|`|C90dO7Mnaa	I cramped early on like PMS. I was so sure I wasn't pregnant, and I was. (We were trying). If your periods are very regular you may want to go the doctor, or wait a few more days to see if your period comes. If your period doesn't come and the cramps get really really intense you should go to your doctor right away.|`|Uid2v2SPaa	i cramped the whole time i was pregnant. Even though ur pregnant u can still get all ur normal period signs. Like i get spotty when i'm on my period, and i got tht whena i was pregannt as well|`|Kt11kk50aa	it doesnt matter if the line was very faint there 99% accurate, your pregnant!<br>  congratulations :] and good luck|`|SSM3u4l4aa	Implantation feels kind of like cramping for a day or so.
mZi7R0Enaa	all wonderful names! Great that you have done so well for a teen mom!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Younger mothers do tend to go for "trendy" names more often than more mature women.  Unfortunately, many trends are simply fads and are short-lived and very much ridiculed once they have passed...thus people say that young mothers tend to give their kids "crazy" names.  However, this is a total stereotype and like all stereotypes does not actually apply to everyone of a given group (in this case, young mothers).<br>  <br>  Your kids' names are fine.  It's not like they can be easily made fun of or turned into horrible nicknames.  Besides, a "good chance in life" has FAR less to do with what a person's name is than how they deal with difficult situations.  After all, names can be legally changed, a person with a poor personality and no coping skills has no easy recourse to change who they are.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Your names aren't bad names.|`|n1mwxljzaa	nooo not at all, your childrens names are beautiful|`|0DtWgXxUaa	No, they don't always! It's a huge sterotype. Asha is alternative, but whatever. Just because older moms chose names like Elizabeth, (ugh!)<br>  My mom was young when she had my older sister, me and my younger sister (Alexis, Mya & Emma) And 10 yrs later she had our baby sisters, Sophia & Kirra. <br>  Personally, I think Alexis & Emma especially are far less "unusual" than Kirra and Sophia. (Kirra mainly, Sophia is common now.)|`|NePgB9b2aa	Wow, I think you have pretty good taste actually! I love Bella & Asha. It's so refreshing to see Asha on a baby girl too! And Riley is adorable on a boy. Kudos :)|`|iKLdGe1xaa	They are lovely names. Asha is unusual but I love it!! I'm adding it to my names list!!|`|IsQckOXraa	no!<br>  all those names are really pretty names!<br>  :)|`|dR2bqUixaa	I like them all!!!|`|e882970a70bc3067939bb37ff8b1e6b8aa	The only one I like is Summer.|`|6XGYzWYbaa	what do names hav anything to do with having a good chance in life|`|CPPBqVaaaa	what does a name have anything to do with " a good chance in life" yeah u are really young..|`|seCbhlLRaa	I really like them all! But I can see how that everybody would like them....they are not Jamie,Ashley,Sara...you get my point. <br>  <br>  But now a days its not odd to have "different" names, at least you can spell and pronounce them, unlike alot of names now a days! <br>  <br>  I wouldn't doubt yourself. And prepare yourself for the day that each of them says they hate their names...I think thats just something every kids thinks at one point or another..even if their name is "normal"!|`|KlWWh3fgaa	SNAP !!<br>  <br>  I get told the exact same thing. People are surprised that I didn't name my daughter a name like,  Star, Lexxii, Miley, Emmaleighah or a name my friend suggested while I was pregnant ::: D'Jolie .... something dumb if you get my drift ! I was planning on asking a question like this later on today, but you beat me to it :-( lol ... I really like your daughters names. They will have a good chance at life. <br>  <br>  My daughters name is Lila ... will she have a good chance at life? lol|`|J7gA5DPUaa	I think your kids names are different but that doesn't mean they are bad. I like it when you don't have 1million of people with the same name in your school! I love the names... but Bella is my favorite!|`|N5EhfDX2aa	There all perfectly acceptable names; not crazy at all.

I love the name Bella|`|4U7327Mzaa	Belle is the French word for beautiful.<br>  <br>  Bella is its Italian equal.
72Fjnwz9aa	YOU CAN HAVE YOUR PERIOD WHILE PREGNANT!! this is  such a common mistake people make. I had mine for three months while pregnant. Putting people in a box and saying it's not possible is why people do not get treatment right away. The fertilized egg can stay in the fallopian tube for up to 5 days after conception then will travel and implant. Implantation  can cause bleeding, if your lining is too thick your body will expel some of that causing you to bleed. So while it may have been a period or another factor the point still stands any unprotected sex can cause pregnancy. Every woman is different on how their body deals with being pregnant. So after that rant..go get tested, take an over the counter or a blood test is more reliable.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No. You had a period. Women do not get periods when they are pregnant. My 5th grade sex ed class taught me this. You can bleed in pregnancy but it's not common and it's usually just spotting or very very light flow. Those symptoms sound like PMS to me. Take a test if you are so worried but you are not pregnant.|`|IoWoDxG8aa	Maybe. Take a test.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	Have you had sex AFTER February 13th?  If not, then no.  Having your period means you aren't pregnant.|`|0iYoPLGIaa	It seems unlikely now if you had a regular period. Take a test.|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	no. its humanly not possible. unless your lying about when you had sex. take a test.|`|zNSDHpV6aa	no
4sjW4Ig5aa	All sounds normal to me.<br>  <br>  My son used to drive me nuts with this sort of thing. Over at Granny's he was the perfect little angel, or so I was told. Right up until I showed up, then let the dramatics begin. I'd take him home, and it would take awhile for him to come out of it and behave again. <br>  <br>  Nobody believed me that he didn't act that way at home. I was positive he was acting that way with her. She was positive he was acting that way with me. We were both frustrated with one another. It was not easy. <br>  <br>  You want to know why: They say, "Everyone says he's good for them when we're gone."? Quite simply, because children do behave better for other people. I used to nanny, and taught preschool for several years. People were always amazed by how beautiful their children behaved while in my care. No great mystery. I wasn't their Mom! It really is that simple. Does it really make sense? Not so much, but that's how it is.<br>  <br>  My personal theory? Kids are manipulative, and it's a lovely power struggle they play as they pit the adults against one another. Sounds kinda jaded but works for me. Now the dramatics don't bother me. It also helps that my son is now 12 and has outgrown most of that behavior.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	He will act better with the grandmother because 1) he knows it isnt his parents and he might not know how to "trick" them and lash out as he finds he can with his parents. 2) It isnt fair to say you taught him the righ behavior because one, I'm sure the parents are doing just fine.  You cant change a childs behavior or make them be good in one week or a weekend.  My kids (age 4 and 2) listen better with other family than us.  It just because they are bashful or more reserved or a different environment.|`|0GqYeMVWaa	yes i would say all was normal too actually......speaking from a friends experience..very similar...hes 15yrs old and still reacts like this....mind boggling really.
GbRIdWzaaa	Well, I am 8 months pregnant right now and i was always told that i was having only one. i mean i have already have 2 ultrasounds and i know it is only one. i went to the Emergency room in the hospital the other day because i had a complication and they told me they could hear two heartbeats. obviously i only have one.  but in your caseyou never know, there may be two. your ultrasound is not that far away right? that is really the only way you will know for sure. good luck i hope it all turns out ok :D|`|CuCrGDuRaa	You will need to have an ultrasound to determine if you are having twins.  Your doctor is most likely right, but an ultrasound will tell for sure.  I am 21 weeks pregnant with twins and when I went to the hospital the first nurse told me there was only one heartbeat but when I went to see an OB nurse she found both.  I hate to say it, but not all emergency room nurses and technicians know what they are doing.  OB doctors have a better idea because they specialize in that area.  Good luck!|`|VpAOZZyoaa	I would wait unless you really really want to know. But I know that unless you are very very tiny then you CAN NOT hear the heartbeat of a baby until 18 weeks. So if you are very very tiny then you could hear a heartbeat but they could have been wrong. If it is not you actual doctor doing it then they are most likely wrong. But if you cant wait then go find out! Congrats!!!!!!!|`|sEFCfHjWaa	You may have misunderstood when they said two heartbeats when you went to the emergency room. Were they saying it in a playful way or in a "yep- there are two heartbeats" kind of way? If it was more playful it was probably yours and the baby's. If not, wait for the ultrasound! Some people just don't carry pregnancy well. Congratulations!
bf8lx9gxaa	You're chances are great! You're going about it the right way too. Charting your basal body temperature and using Ovulation Predicter Kits increase your chances greatly. You can take a pregnancy test up to four days before your missed period, there's nothing you can do now except wait it out. If you get a negative yet you miss your period. Don't worry, just wait a week and take another test. I'm excited for you, I hope you get the positive you want. Anyways, I wish the very best of luck to you sweetie. Let me know how it goes.?|`|6YqjaVOvaa	The least-likely time to get pregnant is the 1st 8 days after your done w/ cycle.
VCCKfT3taa	It's too early for cereal. It's said by some that rice cereal from Gerber helps to fill baby up more, but most people say that's a myth. It hasn't affected my babies sleep or eating schedule at all yet. <br>  <br>  Also remember that cereal is usually introduced to try and get baby's digestive system ready for solids. They have to progress down the 4 stages of food groups (pureed, mashed, lumpy, then chunks) so that you don't bind their system up with food they aren't ready for. <br>  Six weeks is too early to try and get her tummy used to a different consistancy of food. Try closer to 5 or 6 months. <br>  <br>  For breastfeeding babies I heard they tend to have more feedings than bottlefed babies, especially during those first few weeks. Also, she might be going through a growth spurt. Ask her doctor at her next appt. he or she will be able to tell you what percentile she's in and what to do next.|`|wiqspYzLaa	I would not give her anything but breast or formular.<br>  My baby feed every 2 hrs on the breast an slept great how ever my mates baby feed on the breast every 1/2hr she had trouble at first but got used to it an they work great as a team in time she will slow down a year on an she only feeds at night an in the morninig.<br>  You could try eating filling foods as she gets what you eat.<br>  Fromular made my baby more hungry an feed more so try only using it when you need a break.<br>  Keep your head up an your bub will change all the time throught growth sperts she will feed more Good Luck|`|owbC6yIHaa	i believe it's safe , my family have tried that from generation to generations . doctors usually say no cereal until 4 months the most but my son is a month and a half and i use the beech nut oatmeal cereal "but the one with the flakes " i put it in his milk formula "just a pinch of it" in the morning and before he go's to bed just to full him up and it works !! he sleep ok now. just try it for a day or two to see how it works for u .|`|Ka52nbhNaa	It is really not recommended at that age - she is too little to digest it and putting it in her bottle can be a choking hazard.<br>  <br>  At 6 weeks old, her tummy is small, her metabolisim is high and she needs to eat frequently . . . she will settle into a routine soon.<br>  <br>  Best wishes & congrats!|`|TYErFAAzaa	It isn't recommended.  BUT I gave my daughter it the day after she came home from the hospital.  It didn't hurt her.  But if you don't feel comfortable doing it don't.|`|knWxRkDTaa	My son is 6 weeks and I gave him baby cereal 2 days ago...He was exactly like your daughter....I'm feeding it to him with a spoon though and REALLY watered down with formula...He is doing very well with it...I only give it to him once a day though, he eats a tablespoon of cereal and still 6 oz of bottle so he is still getting all of his nutrients...I did a lot of research before I gave it to him and the best answers I got were from my Great Grandma, and she said her children, all 8 of them, were baby cereal fed right away, younger then 6 weeks, and they all were and are fine....<br>  <br>  Its really your own judgement call, your mom, you will know how and when he does.<br>  <br>  P.S. I gave it to him once during the day, made sure he was fine with it, and made sure he pooped the next day as well before i gave it to him again.|`|yB5go5wbaa	it's too early, considering it's recommended to start solids at 6 months.  she could be going through a growth spurt, and really, her weight puts her in the 50th percentile for her age, approximately.  that's normal.  just keep feeding her what she is hungry for; she won't be able to digest cereal properly now anyways, and that's a whole new can of worms.|`|avx7bLnKaa	no don't do cereal you will hurt your mik supply even more...<br>  the nursing habits of your baby are NORMAL! breastfeeding babies eat often!!!!! especially when going through a growth spurt as she either is now, or will be soon...<br>  don't give cereal yet! SHe is a good healthy weight!!!!!|`|SrRafsqraa	Don't give your baby cereal this early.  Not until 4-6 months, and even then your not supposed to put it in the bottle, it actually has higher calories for the baby and develops poor eating habits.   If she wants to eat alot she will stop when she is not hungry.  Sound like she might be cluster feeding, where the baby just wants to eat and eat and eat.  The doctor will tell you if your baby is at an unhealthy weight...but don't give her cereal this early--your baby's digestive system is not fully developed until at least 4 months.|`|3rda58OCaa	No, she is too young for cereal.  Just continue feeding on demand.  She is growing, so she needs lots of milk.  I think the earliest to give cereal is 4 months, but i would wait to as close to 6 months as possible.  If you feel your baby isn't getting "full" then talk to the doctor, but i wouldn't start cereal for a while.|`|a9b3850496c6d2e026d3e06d78b32ecfaa	Please read the information in the link below. I am now breastfeeding our 3rd and I have to tell you what your baby is doing is NORMAL. It is so normal for a baby to grow and nurse nearly 24/7. It will pass. For now, feed on demand and in a week or so you will note a difference in nursing patterns. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/delay-solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a>|`|kj1md6t0aa	I def. would not recommend it. My son was put on rice cereal at 2 months, doctor's orders. My grandparents did it earlier but I think it would be insane to do it that early.
2f6diQBiaa	It isn't considered your period until you get actual flow, but it doesn't really matter on Clomid (some women take it without ever getting a period). Go ahead and take it. You should ovulate 5-10 days after your last pill.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!|`|13hFRGN9aa	if your doctor checked you and prescribed clomid then its because you aren't pg. start the clomid.|`|93c02e5b1d7a30f862c52f37ff112c4aaa	i would start it when the color change on it sometime before your actual cycle starts it would show signs that it is coming and brown is one of them and then it will change to red......good luck i know how you feel i dont have regular cycles

3rda58OCaa	Ok first of all, HITTING HER FOR HITTING makes absolutely NO SENSE-don't do that.<br>  <br>  My daughter is now 31 months and used to do the exact same things!!  She still has a few outbursts, but not much.  As she is learning to talk and communicate better so she doesn't get so frustrated and upset.  <br>  <br>  My main way to solve the tantrums was to avoid them!  I know that may sound impossible, but trust me it works.  If you know she is going to throw a fit when it is time to leave the park-give her a 5 min warning and then scoop her and take her straight to the car.  I mostly avoided fits when we were out and about.  Now at home, I simply take her to her room until her fit is over and then speak with her.  I always try hard to get on her level (looking her in the eye) and figure out the problem.  The main thing is is remain calm yourself.  If you are frustrated and yelling at her she is going to get even more upset.  <br>  <br>  Let her know that you care about what she wants and is needing at the time.  If she can't have what she wants then offer an alternative.  If she wants a cookie before dinner then offer her a pc of bread or something instead.  If she starts to hit or biting firmly look her in the eye and say "no hitting!"  Don't yell, but speak in your firmest, authoritative voice.  Your daughter is only trying to communicate with you, and gets frustrated trying to.  <br>  <br>  If she keeps throwing a fit simply because she can't get her way i just put her in her room and she has to stay until she is finished crying.  My daughter walks to her room herself now, I simply point in the direction of her room before her fit is full blown and she toddles to her room until she is no longer crying.  She never hits or bites anymore either.  I give an automatic time-out for those offenses and she must apologize after her 2 min timeout.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Maybe take her to the dr if she is hurting herself! Honestly, I would spank her if she got too out of control. Wait for her to calm down, then put her in time out and explain why she is in time out. if my child came after me, trying to hit or bite me, I would have to use my hand.|`|0ky4TktEaa	Well for one thing she may be having some issues as a result of you and her father not being together. In other words, she only gets to see one of you at a time. That means 2 different places, 2 different environments, 2 different groups of people, possibly 2 different people who are significant others (ex. your boyfriend/dad's girlfriend). All of that takes a toll on a child. If she spends most of the time with you and doesn't see dad as often, she could be cutting up because she misses him. <br>  <br>  As for the hitting, biting and scratching, that needs to be taken care of with a spanking. 2 years old is old enough to know that you do not hit your parent. Spank her, sit her in a time out spot, explain why she's there and that she DOES NOT hit/scratch/whatever mommy, get up and walk away. In a few minutes, come back and ask if she's ready to come tell mommy she's sorry and come back and finish playing/whatever. <br>  <br>  Not all children respond to time outs and explanations or threats for that matter. If you make threats of what will happen if she cuts up, make sure they're not empty. Follow through on whatever kind of discipline you say she'll get. A child knows when you mean something and when you don't.|`|84c78b4b1cdd45b160c8f70ce65700afaa	My son gets like that too. He's not 2 yet but will be in a month. Sometimes I pop him if he gets too out of control but just a quick swat to get his attention. I tell him it's not nice and he'll get a time out. Sometimes I walk away and let him finish having his tantrum. He usually gets up after a while and comes to find me and that's the end of it. It's getting better with time. Just keep trying different things until something works. He hardly ever acts like that with the men in the family. I think it's worse with the primary caregiver.|`|0GqYeMVWaa	crikey thats really hard...my daughter used to have crazy moments of whizzing around the floor and tantrums that were horrible....i sometimes thought the devil may have taken her over....im serious....i actually had to leave her to get on with it....but i never hit her...whats the point,it just makes you feel worse in the end....and it doesnt work anyhow....my daughter acted like this infront of her daddy and complete strangers...in fact one day in the street in front of 2 cops...i nearly died of embarrassment...they thought it was hilarious....she did grow out of this ..the aggression is only because she cant express herself any other way.....distraction is a great way out,i used to turn on very load music and dance like a loonie...that worked sometimes..or id have a tantrum...that worked too....hope it helps...|`|117abff9116e3a46733b70216ee24e7aaa	That how my 2 yr old is shes perfect at her dads n daycare she com|`|yGgFvd2Haa	put  her  time out
lGrcLQ49aa	I don't think the cloth diapers have anything to do with that - the normal range for walking can be between 9 - 18 months.  You child is still well with in normal and as long as he is standing and cruising around while holding on then he is doing great - my 3 kids all walked around 14-15 months - all have been tested as above average IQ and have no difficulties.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Some babies don't walk till they are 18 months old!  Don't worry.  It's not his cloth diaper (which btw is a wonderful choice in diapering!)|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Back in the olden days 1977 we only had cloth, and my son walked at 9 mo 3 weeks. <br>  Babies walk when they are ready, but still encourage him to walk and hold on to the sofa.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I used to wonder that, too, since my oldest wore cloth and didn't walk until 13 1/2 months.  In hindsight, I think she was just a very cautious baby and wouldn't do anything until she *knew* she could do it.  She was an early sitter (4 1/2 months) and focused on her fine motor skills before concentrating on gross motor.  She had been cruising for about 3 months and pushing a toy car around for 2 months when she finally took her first independent steps.<br>  <br>  I know other kids who didn't wear cloth and didn't walk until 15 months, so I really don't think the cloth made the difference.  You could always try disposables for a few days just to see, but I doubt it.  <br>  <br>  Hmm, now that I'm thinking about it, though, my oldest took her first steps on her own when she was naked and getting ready to get in the bath.  Then, we were on vacation for the next week, and she only wore disposables b/c we had no place to wash the cloth.  I guess she didn't start walking in the cloth after all (although she walked and ran in them just fine once we got back home).|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	Well, from very personal experience - I was a cloth-diapered baby, and I started walking at 8 months old!  My 19-month younger brother didn't start walking until a well over a year old - maybe even at 18 months old, my mother has said.   So I am inclined to think that cloth diapers have nothing to do with it really.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I doubt if that would have much to do with it. Maybe he just is not ready. You probably should check with his Doctor, not that there is anything wrong, but just to make sure and ask about the diapers. Maybe you could try "Pampers" or "Luvs" once in a while to see if that makes a difference, but probably not.<br>  <br>  Most babies learned to walk fine, including me, when all there were were cloth diapers.|`|AA11903503	No it's not the cloth diapers, more than likely it is the socks.<br>  It has been proven that babies who turn one during winter months generally walk later, up to 3 months later than summer babies. <br>  make sure your little one wears grippy socks or goes barefoot so the toes can grip the ground.|`|yGgFvd2Haa	no he's  just  a  little scared   to the   take  his   first  steps
ysvOGwVHaa	If you are not ready, no age is the right one. It doesn't matter how old everyone else was or is. It should be a choice that is up to you. You do NOT have to do it just because everyone else has. You do not have to do it to be cool. If you are not comfortable with it, it is not time yet.<br>  <br>  You may not be ready until you are 20 or 27 even. Everyone is different. If you are ready, go for it. But don't be stupid about it. Use protection. You don't need to get nasty diseases just because of teenage curiosity. And for heavens sake, you don't want to get pregnant either (or get a girl preggo...not sure if you are a girl or boy...)<br>  <br>  Anyway, this is really a personal choice and I think WAY too many people do it because everyone else is. It isn't a special thing anymore. I know a ton of people who wish they would have waited until they were older.<br>  <br>  Be a kid while you still have a chance. You don't have to grow up so fast. Have fun. Be footloose and fancy free. Don't worry so much about what other people think. Worry more about what you will think of yourself afterwards. Have a little self-respect.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Don't do it until you are truly ready. If you have to question it, you are not ready. And I do highly recommend only doing it with those that you are in a serious, lasting relationship with...flings rarely make us happy. Believe me, I know more of this from personal experience than I would like to admit.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	you'll know<br>  <br>  just don't do anything stupid|`|ojwRgCLqaa	How ever old you are after you get married!

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I don't understand why some of the other women are being so mean to you about your question. But the chance of miscarriage goes way down once you hit 12 weeks. I am pretty sure that every single woman that has ever been pregnant has worried about an early miscarriage, especially if they have had one before. So you are not alone. The only thing you can do is take good care of yourself, take your vitamins and go to your prenatal visits and wait. And know that early miscarriage and chemical pregnancy RARELY have anything to do with the mother and there is nothing you can do to prevent them. They occur because there are chromosomal abnormalities that would prevent the embryo or fetus from surviving until term. Unfortunately it is just something that happens sometimes. Not that any of that makes it feel better.  Just try to relax and not to worry. Call your Dr and set up an appointment. Best Wishes!!!|`|mldo1vxYaa	Dont really know what you are saying but they say once you have reached 3 months the chances of a miscarriage lessen although they can still happen. The most important thing you can do is try and relax and believe this baby will be ok. Stressing about it will not do you any good or the baby.|`|hKv7RcKLaa	Honestly I've had a miscarriage twice. It hurt me very badly. I just try my best not to think about it. Im pregnant right now and its possible I will miscarriage in my second or third trimester. I'm just beginning my second trimester. I'm afraid also. I feel like I'm counting down to the day my baby dies because the doctor told me 50% chance it could happen because an antibody I have. Best way to deal with it I guess is try your best not to think about it. I get my blood drawn every four weeks to make sure im doing fine so the baby will survive. No matter what happens it happens for a reason and that's why I've tried to move on about miscarriage. It's always a possibility but think of the best =].|`|dc81da2d89eef9b38499524fbc9b5288aa	Honestly!  If the women in this section cannot read your abbreviations, then they should not be answering questions here.<br>  <br>  Okay, back to yours.  I was the same way.  scared to death!  I did keep taking $1 tests every few days to make sure they were still positive.  and when I went for my 1st appointment I complained of this pain I had on the left side....it was more of a twinge actually and it did not really hurt, I was just nervous because I did not know what it was.  But I knew that mentioning it would get me a sonogram and it did....5.5 weeks in I got my first sonogram.  and I got to see that tiny little flutter of a heartbeat!  So then I knew the baby was implanted properly and had a heartbeat, which is a huge relief and took some of the fear away (and I stopped taking home tests after that).  <br>  <br>  Then when I went for my 2nd appointment I was 10.5 weeks and I could hear the heartbeat loud and clear (but only for a few seconds because the baby kept moving) so hearing it was music to my ears.  I am right now 11 weeks so I am not completely out of the woods yet, but having seen and heard the heartbeat and seeing the baby implanted in the right place, I  have a VERY good feeling that my baby will be just fine.<br>  <br>  Also stay away from ALL risks....even when people tell you "I did it and my baby was fine" or "that is not dangerous" do not listen and think only of the baby.  No caffeine, no alcohol, eat well, rest some, exercise some, take vitamins, folic acid...do it all.  then you will know that you did the best by your baby that possibly could.
kaqPSgTVaa	If you did indeed ovulate on the 16th then no it's unlikely you are pregnant. The egg is only viable for 24 hours so you may have missed your window. To properly concieve you are suppose to have sex BEFORE you ovulate and the day of, not after. But if you aren't sure that you ovulated that day you could still have gotten pregnant.|`|4VBoqt4jaa	take a test.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	I on the other hand would take test.

Try having special toys for the car and putting a mirror on the head rest so she has something to look at.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psmUWg7QrC8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psmUWg7Qr...</a>|`|an8O7r4kaa	it could be just cause she wants to see everyone. maybe if you had someone sit next to her in the car and entertain her she might calm down.|`|24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	I am not sold on the whole rear facing thing being safer in the first place.  However, my 6 week old is rear facing because it is the law and most recommend it being safer, but I don't have to like it.<br>  <br>  The reccomendation is 1 year and I think 20ish lbs (that is a ways away for me). That is also the law in most states.  So yes they should and can safely turn her front facing.  <br>  <br>  Of course she cries, she wants to see what is happening and not the back of the seat.  She is old enough now that she wants to participate in what is happening in the car.  <br>  <br>  How did all of us make it through alive?  Those of us who were born before the 90's or so were front facing and we all survived somehow.  <br>  <br>  Really I think you are all over reacting and overly protective, turn her around and let her see what is going on.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	My kids all hated the car, too, and were all happier when we turned them front-facing.  With my first two, I'd never heard the recommendation to keep them rear-facing for longer than a year, so I just turned them once they were past a year and had hit 20 pounds or more.  I think it was right at a year for my oldest and maybe 14 months for my next child.<br>  <br>  With my third, he was a little happier because he was in the middle row of the minivan with his sisters behind him, so he had some entertainment.  I turned him forward-facing at 16 months, though, because it was becoming a real struggle to get him in his seat.<br>  <br>  I absolutely believe that it's safer to be rear-facing, but I also believe that it's safer to drive without a screaming child in the back.  I think I was a much safer driver once my kids calmed down in the car.  I also think that at least two of my kids got carsick when they rode backwards, so their tummies felt better when they were riding forward.<br>  <br>  Have they tried using a mirror so that she can still see them (and they her)?  Have they tried any new toys lately?  How about a CD that she likes?  <br>  <br>  This is a tough decision for them to make, and I hope they can find a solution to keep her rear-facing and happy at the same time.  If not, they'll have to consider if the overall safety of everyone in the car is improved by having her face forward and not be screaming the whole time.<br>  <br>  I definitely feel their pain.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	That's a tough one because a crying baby can actually make the driver unsafe.  I know it would for me (I don't drive, but crying really gets to me).<br>  <br>  Also while I didn't turn my son around until he was 2 1/2 (too tall for the seat and I debated getting a new one but decided it probably wasn't worth it to get 4-6 more months rear-facing given our financial situation) I would let my son ride forward facing in my mom's van (built in seats) rather than move his seat.<br>  <br>  A few things to try to make the car ride more enjoyable:<br>  * Change the angle of the seat, most parents leave the seat at 45 degrees when rear-facing but this is only needed for infants.  Its actually more safe to be at 30 degrees once the baby has good neck control.  At 30 degrees she may be more comfortable and able to see more.<br>  <br>  *Try getting a mirror and positioning it so toddler can see out the window, rather than positioning it so that driver can see baby.<br>  <br>  *If she sits with legs bent put a rolled up blanket or small pillow under her knees or knees and shins to keep the legs well supported and in a better position.  Remember you can't add padding between the baby and the harness, or the baby's torso and the seat back, but its perfectly safe to add pillow beside the head, beside the torso and the sides of the seats or under the legs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.carseat.org/Technical/tech_update.htm#angleRF" rel="nofollow">http://www.carseat.org/Technical/tech_up...</a><br>  Angle of recline, rear-facing<br>  <br>  The back surface of a rear-facing CR should be between 30° and 45° from vertical, starting with the most reclined angle for a newborn and becoming more upright as the baby grows. This recommendation is a balance between crash protection and comfort. If the CR is too upright, the head could flop forward uncomfortably and possibly pinch off the airway, especially for a newborn. If the CR is too reclined during a frontal crash, the infant could slide toward the top of the restraint, exposing the head to injury, especially for the larger, heavier baby.<br>  <br>  Each manufacturer determines an optimum back angle for its products and specifies a way, such as a level indicator, for the user to determine that angle. However, these indicators only work when the vehicle is level, so they can sometimes be misleading. The Federal standard allows the back of a rear-facing CR to rotate downward as much as 70° from vertical during the FMVSS 213 crash test, but this extreme result reflects the test conditions and would not represent good crash performance. To meet these test requirements, some restraint manufacturers may install their position indicators so the initial angle is too upright for a small infant. For these situations, installing the seat with the indicator outside the specified zone may be necessary, or one must obtain a different safety seat. The baby’s airway must not be compromised.<br>  <br>  To set an appropriate back angle for the child, install the CR in the car and put the baby in the CR with the buttocks in the deepest part of the CR and the baby's back straight. Jostle the CR a bit, and, if the baby's head flops forward (while awake or asleep), it is necessary to increase the angle. For infant-only restraints, some bases can be adjusted if more recline is needed, or a detachable base can be removed and the shell alone reclined a little more. Otherwise, for these and for convertibles, insert a tightly rolled towel or sheet or a foam "noodle" under the toe-end of the CR to compensate for the slope of the vehicle seat. Increase the angle of recline just enough to keep the baby's head from flopping forward, but no more than 45° from vertical.<br>  <br>  The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends that infants born at less than 37 weeks gestation be monitored in a semi-upright position prior to discharge to detect possible breathing, oxygenation level, and/or heart rhythm problems (AAP, 2006). If a baby needs to be more reclined than 45°, he must be tested similarly in a car bed to see if discharge is appropriate, and if so the car bed must be used for travel. There is also evidence that prolonged (over an hour) semi-upright positioning may lead to reduced oxygen saturation levels even among term infants. It is therefore recommended that very young infants not be left undisturbed in their rear-facing child restraints for long periods.<br>  <br>  As the child grows, becomes heavier, and can hold his head erect, the angle can be decreased, making the restraint more upright, to provide better crash protection. For a sleeping baby, this angle should be at least 30° from vertical. In addition to improved comfort, keeping the back of the baby's head in contact with the CR provides better protection in a crash. In some vehicles, the back seat may be too small to accommodate a convertible CR that is reclined as far as 45° in the rear-facing position. For older babies, the CR may be used at a more upright angle to make it fit in the car, but a newborn may require a smaller infant-only restraint.

His legs were all crunched up.  Our doctor said that it is safer to remain rear-facing in the event of a major accident.  On the other hand, if she is tall like my son was then even a minor accident could crush her legs.  You could try letting her watch a movie with one of those car tv's or laptops.  If this isn't an option then try someone sitting back there with her and reading to her or playing games such as peek-a-boo.  Toys are great if the driver is alone with her.  She is at the age where she likes to see people and her surroundings.  She gets bored easily so you have to keep her entertained.|`|f298053ebd42df4c5da5f85a6ead96d4aa	My 22 month old is rear-facing, and while she is generally happy once in the car, getting her into the seat is a whole different story. She braces her legs against the seatback and refuses to sit. I know if I turned her, she'd have no way to do that, but it's not worth the safety risk for me.<br>  <br>  What helps a lot, is that any time there is more than one adult in the car, someone sits in the back with her. She also has a mirror on the headrest, so the driver can see her and vice versa. I also keep snacks and a cup of water in the car, and let her pick out a toy or two to bring with us. I've also noticed that she goes through phases - for a month or two she'll hate the car, and then for a month or two it's not so bad. <br>  <br>  I've heard from several parents that the novelty of being forward-facing wears off quickly, and they go back to hating the car again, anyway. For me, the risk is definitely not worth the extra bit of sanity.|`|ILhYHJi6aa	No! Although it would be easier for your sis it is not safe for the baby untill she is 30lbs plus.  I think that the your niece has learned a behavior and needs to learn that she doesnt get her way all the time.  It is good to teach learning at an early age... so give her a nookie and tell her "mama is still with you" in the car. Talk to her while driving or in the passanger seat or if more than just the baby and driver have someone sit in back with her.|`|Ya8RcJpuaa	I think that we can all agree that safety and convenience are two separate things, safety of coarse being the more important of the two.

lGrcLQ49aa	There is no reason for babies to be fat. 14 pounds at 6 months is good, if your doctor is happy and your child eats well then let it be.

If you were to have a baby with a different man that is a higher chance (I'm just saying that's the case, I'm not saying you are going to leave hubby or anything)<br>  <br>  If you do have pre-eclampsia again it is likely to be less severe and happen later on in the pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mumzone.com.au/preg_article_pre_eclampsia_faqs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mumzone.com.au/preg_article_p...</a><br>  Fortunately, most mothers who have suffered even severe forms of Pre Eclampsia in their first pregnancies have perfectly normal subsequent pregnancies. Nevertheless, there is a small risk that the condition will recur, and so women who have suffered Pre Eclampsia in a first pregnancy should be monitored more closely and more frequently than usual in subsequent pregnancies. If Pre Eclampsia does recur, it usually does so in a milder form and at a later time in the pregnancy than on the first occasion.<br>  <br>  However, women who have suffered the HELLP syndrome form of Pre Eclampsia do seem to have a higher recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies, with some studies suggesting as many as 25% of these women suffering such recurrences.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, women with medical problems such as chronic hypertension, renal disease,<br>  diabetes, lupus and other autoantibody problems, and certain forms of inherited blood clotting disorders may also be at particular risk of recurrent Pre Eclampsia in their pregnancies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nmh.org/nmh/adam/pregnancy/000200.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmh.org/nmh/adam/pregnancy/00...</a><br>  Some studies show that taking low doses of aspirin every day may prevent pre-eclampsia from recurring. There is also some evidence that calcium may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in high-risk women. If you had pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy, talk to your doctor about whether this makes sense for you<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Q: Will cutting out salt lower my chances of developing pre-eclampsia?<br>  <br>  A: No. While too much sodium is never good, you need salt to help promote the flow of fluid in your body. Talk to your doctor about how much salt is safe to consume during pregnancy. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancy-bliss.co.uk/eclampsia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancy-bliss.co.uk/eclamps...</a><br>  Will the pre-eclampsia recur in the next pregnancy?<br>  The odds are that it will not. If this was the mother's first pregnancy, she has a roughly one in four (25 per cent) chance of having the condition in her subsequent pregnancy. If she was affected in her second or later pregnancy, the risk is higher, up to one in two, i.e. 50 per cent.<br>  In a small group of patients, pre-eclampsia recurs in every pregnancy. These women are considered to have an underlying latent essential hypertension<br>  .<br>  What are the affected mother's chances of developing chronic hypertension later on in life?<br>  For the majority of women who suffer from pre-eclampsia in one pregnancy (usually the first), the risk is similar to that of the general population, i.e. it is not increased. The story is different for those who experience recurrent pre-eclampsia in each pregnancy. Here, as mentioned before, the risk of chronic hypertension later on in life is significantly above average.<br>  Recurrent pre-eclampsia is therefore regarded as a sign of latent hypertension.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  There is some evidence that pre-eclampsia is somewhat diet related, which is certainly something you can control and is generally safe (often healthier than your current diet)<br>  <a href="http://blueribbonbaby.org/" rel="nofollow">http://blueribbonbaby.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/pcomplications/topics/0,,4rs7,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/nutrition/dietandpreeclampsiaexpert/" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycentre.co.uk/pregnancy/nu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.storknet.com/ip/reproductive_years/high_risk/preeclampsia.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.storknet.com/ip/reproductive_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wddty.com/03363800369137090515/pre-eclampsia-a-disease-of-malnutrition.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wddty.com/0336380036913709051...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17521921" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17521...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/news/2008/07July/Pages/Fibreandpreeclampsia.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhs.uk/news/2008/07July/Pages...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.drmyhill.co.uk/article.cfm?id=424" rel="nofollow">http://www.drmyhill.co.uk/article.cfm?id...</a><br>  <a href="http://pregnancy.amuchbetterway.com/prevent-preeclampsia-diet-nutrition/" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy.amuchbetterway.com/prev...</a><br>  <a href="http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/pcomplications/0,,4b0,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://parenting.ivillage.com/pregnancy/...</a><br>  <br>  After skimming these they confirm what I already knew.

Many studies show it reduces the risk of preterm labour and miscarriages.  However it does "coordinate" the uteruses toning contractions and for some women this makes them more noticeable (for some women it makes them less noticeable).  Because of this increase in braxton hicks some people believe it causes labour -which is simply not true for healthy women.  <br>  <br>  Even true oxytocic herbs (and err semen, etc) won't cause contractions in a uterus that isn't in "child birthing" mode.  I must stress that red raspberry leaf is NOT an oxytocic herb or emmenogogue (emmenogogues are unsafe during pregnancy).  Of course a few women do have hormonal irregularities and just like in a few women sex can cause preterm labour so can RRL -but that's no reason for women to abstain because both sex and RRL are beneficial.

There is a whole world of change in him over the past 3 years.|`|okh3hL8taa	What is wrong with him is that ever since he was born you have ALLOWED him to be fussy and demanding and have spoiled him.  You have made him the problem child he is now.  Stop blaming the child for his behavior and start blaming yourselves for raising him to be this way.|`|HSB3BMqcaa	u have no son XD<br>  just kidding<br>  <br>  call supernanny or something|`|MJ5juxzpaa	spank him.|`|O0Q11TXKaa	Been there... My husband & I met when my son was 4. I had a daughter who was six years older. My son seemed to be MUCH worse than my daughter ever was. I just figured it was because he ws a boy... My husband had a son from a previous marriage who has ADHD, and he suggested having my son evaluated. I was unsure due to the stigma around anything psycho-whatever at that time in my life, so at first I didn't pursue it.  After many rounds with my son, and the fear of losing a great man in my life, we had him evaluated.  Hence his diagnosis of ADHD. He was put on medication & we sought therapy to help him learn about and cope with the struggles he goes through due to his hyperactivity.<br>  <br>  Our son is now 10 years old, an excellent 4th grade student, learning the baritone, and overall doing very well.  He still has impulse issues, and you'll never get around having to discipline for errors in a child's judgment which cause him to overstep those boundaries.  It's an ongoing thing.  I wish you the best of luck, and don't be afraid to have your son checked :)|`|j3wown0oaa	If all you say is true: ( you have rules and consequences) for him and you consistently follow through, you are certain that he has never been physically or mentally abused or neglected then you have a bigger problem.  It's very possible that he has a mental condition, or a physical disorder that is keeping him from being able to control himself.  <br>  If I were you I would consult your Pediatrician asap.  Tell the doctor everything, so that you can get the right referral.  He/she should run some test to make sure there are no physical issues (sleep disorders, allergies) that are effecting your son, before he is referred to psychiatric.<br>  Also, just for the record I am against medicating kids to control their behavior.  I believe that with proper counseling and training most kids can learn to control themselves.|`|jcEtRUVZaa	I would say he needs some serious guidelines for behavior. I'd start with giving him chores to keep him busy for a while, and spending as much 1:1 time with him as you can. Sounds like you guys are on the right track, it takes a while for consequences to sink in. Be as consistent as you can possibly be.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, here's some ideas about the importance of chores:<br>  <br>  How to Teach Your Child Responsibility Through Chores<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4803459_teach-child-responsibility-through-chores.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4803459_teach-ch...</a>|`|uA2bA3mnaa	I empathize with your situation....I have had very similar problems with my kids, especially my oldest, now 9 and my youngest, 6.  I have been able to contribute the majority of their behavior to food allergies/sensitivities.  I absolutely recommend going to see a NAET practitioner.  Check out www.naet.com.  I have had amazing results with my children.  I kept hoping my oldest would grow out of it, but rather he would get more destructive as he got older.  I had problems with him ever since he could walk.  My youngest, very similar problems.  Literally I thought I was going to lose my mind.  I also tried everything.  It was not until I put them on the Feingold diet that I was actually able to figure out that there were "trigger" foods in their diet that prompted this defiant and destructive behavior.  When I figured out what was bothering them, I took them to a NAET practitioner and had them treated.  It really does work - it is so amazing and has given me my family back.  If you haven't already, look at your food labels, start with taking all additives, preservatives and coloring out of your child's diet.  Then go from there.  I had tried that at first and it didn't work - so because of my oldest's complaining about his tummy and crying I took him to a GI speciallist. He was allergic to wheat and soy - but that was all the test showed.  So we had him treated, but that wasn't the end of it.  It was so hard to figure it out.  The fiengold diet really helped.  Once we took salicylates out of their diet - I saw a dramatic improvement coupled with no preservatives and coloring.  Don't forget, toothpaste and mouthwash have coloring too.  Good luck!  It's difficult, but if you try to figure it out now, it will save you years of heartache and frustration.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think your child needs to be evaluated not that this is a bad thing. Behavior can be caused by different things ADHD. My son had behaviors and teachers were concerned  and I took him to the doctor and found out he had a form of Autism called Aspergers.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Have you taken him to a be evaluated by a child phsycologist? I think that would be appropriate. Behavior like that can be caused my many things and should be attended to quickly.

She needed you most after the divorce and she probably feels like you abandoned her when she needed you.|`|FiUprYsvaa	Not much you can do. <br>  You can't force her. <br>  <br>  All you can do it try to be a part of her life.|`|fAp0vFAHaa	Rather than approaching her before explaining just spill out your explanation quickly but not quickly as possible such that she doesn't understand what your trying to say but before you see the sign of rejection towards listening to you.|`|PWkZffEzaa	Technically your daughter has the ultimate decision on whether she wants to see you... and sadly she's already decided.|`|70At0HClaa	cudave wudave shudave, the fact is your daughter feels she was low on your list of priorties, and she making this known to you no matter what your problems they just excuses to her, you could have found a way because your children should come before anyone. there is always a compromise, and you will have to go through a boatload of making amends if you want her to forgive you. write her a letter, don,t make excuses tell her you know you should have done more, tried harder, and hope she forgives you. leave the ball in her court, but make sure you fullfill whatever you promise. tell her you love her very much but have made mistakes and want to rectifiy them if she will let you if not now at a future date no time limit good luck.|`|dq16ybzgaa	Try putting yourself in her shoes, she probably feels that since you're not going to York to see her she is the one making all the effort. You are paying for her to go but money means nothing. <br>  <br>  Obviously its difficult to leave your fiancée but to have a good relationship with your daughter you are going to have to compromise. See if family or friends will stay with your fiancée for a night or two so you can spend some time with your daughter. Leaving your fiancée alone wasn't the best option for her but making your daughter travel to see you most of the time isn't the best option for her either. <br>  <br>  Make an effort to go and see her once in a while or you are going to lose your daughter. She needs to know that you love her and haven't forgotten her for your new family.

Never leave time go by without telling her how much she means to you regardless of the times she might say she wants nothing to do with you.<br>  <br>  Your daughter is thinking of herself now and nobody else, the fact that you have a new life and your own problems won't make a difference, she'll keep thinking you're not making enough of an effort to be with her unfortunately.  Have you thought about speaking to her mother and trying to get her come stay with you for a couple of days so you can spend some quality time together talking about how you both feel?<br>  <br>  I really do hope some good comes out of all this as I'm sure you're beside yourself through not seeing her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|F6lZHRkVaa	If you didn't see your daughter because your fiancee and her child were more important, then maybe your daughter is right to be upset.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	once yr daughter is 18 she is an adult and it will be up to her whether to see u or not, indeed even younger than this any court will listen to a chld old enough to voice their opinion about their wishes and take these into account.   it sounds as tho yr daughter feels u have favoured yr fiancee over her and to a teenager probably the prospect of being with a mentally unsound dads girlfriend was not a very attractive prospect.|`|OHfcGAgIaa	mate, it's hard but think about it from her view. I bet she feels like you've neglected her and gone off with someone else. She probably feels left out. even if you're new partner is bi-polar that won't matter one bit to her. she's your daughter and you're the one who should be making the effort not her. sorry to sound harsh but it's the truth.|`|xubIaiZaaa	i dont know where you live, but i am in australia and once a child is 18 they are legally classed as an adult, and you can do nothing. <br>  <br>  :( sorry|`|4M6RSigmaa	Maybe write a letter to her.

Z1e3Cxjoaa	You can try sex (the sperm have prostaglandins in it to help ripen your cervix) but the best way that I have used is nipple stimulation...if you have a breastpump then pump for at least an hour every so often to help get certain hormones going and it starts a chain reaction.  All of the other ways you could try but don't have much fact behind them.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Sex is the only one that has been proven effective. Walking,it's a myth. Dr's told me that. It doesn't induce labor in the slightest.|`|Q6Ihs4otaa	try sex, walking and moving your hips front to back and side to side while bending your knees just a little bit.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Try sex and nipple stimulation. Semen contains prostaglandins that help ripen the cervix so that it will dilate. Female orgasm produces oxytocin, which then starts contractions. Oxytocin is the body's natural form of the same medication they would give you at the hospital to induce you. Nipple stimulation done every 15 minutes for 5 minutes at a time for 4 hours will also stimulate the nipples. I would avoid the breast pump and just do it with your fingers. Using the pump could stimulate your milk to come in and the colostrum that you are producing before your milk is very important for baby. It contains many nutrients and antibodies that your baby will use to fight off infection for the rest of it's life.  But both sex and nipple stimulation have worked for my husband and I twice. I plan on using it again when I get to at least 39 weeks. But keep in mind, if baby isn't ready, nothing you do will make it :) So don't get frustrated if it doesn't work. Good Luck!!!<br>  <br>  I would also avoid Castor Oil. Not only is it vile tasting. But every one I have ever heard that tried it, says that it doesn't work and only causes severe cramping and diarrhea. If you do happen to cramp yourslef into labor you could be very dehydrated and weak from the diarrhea. 90% of women poop while giving birth anyway and think of the mess you could have during delivery. It is also controversial bc some experts think it causes the baby to have it;s first bowel movement in the womb and if that gets into baby's lungs it can be dangerous.|`|35kVNi5oaa	Um. good sex, an orgasim will help you along. then go for a nice long walk|`|duinadV4aa	try sex and walking|`|ADjeuxIiaa	Almost all OB doctors will be willing to induce after 39 weeks, you could ask. Also, there are many wives tales said to help induce labor. Keep in mind some could be dangerous...<br>  <br>  Sex is a great (and fun) way used to induce labor. His semen (which contains prostaglandins) can stimulate contractions<br>  <br>  Walking.<br>  <br>  Castor Oil. It is said to work by causing spasms in the intestines, which surround the uterus toward the end of pregnancy. These spasms, in turn, cause the uterus to cramp, which might result in labor. (You can take 1 to 4 ounces of castor oil mixed with 6 ounces of orange juice to cut its oiliness. You'll want to drink it quickly because of the unpleasant taste. Some practitioners suggest taking a single dose; others suggest repeated doses depending on your response.)<br>  <br>  Spicy Food<br>  <br>  Blue and Black Cohosh. Blue cohosh is believed to make uterine contractions stronger, while black cohosh may regulate the contractions.<br>  <br>  And of course, rupturing the membranes/ breaking the water|`|ceJazsZCaa	Sex<br>  Walking<br>  Get someone to startle you.

But you could have PG symptoms before a m/c as well.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If it's very very early, in the first week that your period was due it's usually not any different from what your normal period feels like. In fact 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage before the expected period and the woman bleeds assuming it was her period. <br>  <br>  If it's any later there would be worse bleeding, cramping, possibly feeling ill.

I know i would never want my child looking for me, be sure to find out the reason if you can before you go looking any further, im not saying they will not want anything to do with you, just dont get your hopes up. Or maybe just apreciate what you have, paretns that love you, they are your real parents, your biological parents are just donors.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Realisticly, the adoption agency wont give out any information to you, until you are 18, usually that is the agreement, so why not wait until you are 18 before you go looking and contact the adoption agency, if your parents wanted you to be able to contact them when you were 18 the adoption agency should give you information on your adoption but if not then dont bother because they might not have wanted you to find them<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ok, ready for the thumbs down, but the truth hurts, thats life|`|oJhr79cgaa	I was adopted thtough a closed adoption as a special needs child when i was 2. i found my family when i turned 18.

I had to wait for them to get signatures from my birth parents stating that it was ok to give me their information and that they wanted to talk to me. check with who ever dealt with your adoption case and see if they can help at all. If not do you know your birth parents name? if it is rare enough you can do it the way my husband and i did which was i just looked up phone numbers and addresses on the internet of people with that name and called or wrote a letter and it worked.I found his family too.

AA11910088	May GOD Truly Bless You and your unborn=)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Really only your doctor can answer these questions. When you go back to your doctor ask him your qusetions and let him know about the other father being a heavy drug user. Ask your doctor if that may have played a role.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	They can stitch up your cervix to help the baby stay in there. What I was told by my doctor was that they really cant say what causes women to miscarry its just one of those things that happens. Mother natures way of taking care of itself. I too have had one and they aren't fun, but there really isn't anything that can be done to prevent them, other then stitching up the cervix, and that's if your cervix just doesn't close. I don't see how the father being a drug user would effect the baby unless you were the one using the drugs. Stuff like this happens and I just look at it like maybe it was for the best, there might have been something severely wrong with the baby and like I said before mother nature just took care of it. That's how I looked at it when I had mine. Don't stress out about it too much bc that's not healthy for you or the baby. If its meant to be then it will be. Good luck|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well the drug use could be a factor because the drugs could damage the sperm and even though the sperm was able to fertilize an egg it may have had some genetic problem which would be why you miscarried.  The stitching is if you have an incompetent or short cervix and the stitch basically makes it to where nothing can come out.  I don't know about the antiobiotics.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	There's really no way of knowing, without knowing why you miscarried.

SSM3u4l4aa	The secret is orgasm. Not just his but your own. A good, deep orgasm includes uterine contractions.. and in some cases they can help to trigger labor. <br>  Best of luck and enjoy!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Just have sex...It's usually the orgasm that helps bring on contractions but it doesn't always work.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	um...just have sex?|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Sex won't work until your uterus goes into "birthing mode"<br>  <br>  Oxytocin (including synthetic pitocin) simply won't work if the uterus doesn't have receptors or they are blocked/<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/articles/bfpregnancy_safety.html#uterus" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/artic...</a><br>  The well-protected uterus<br>  <br>  The specter of breastfeeding-induced preterm labor appears to spring in large part from an incomplete understanding of the interactions between nipple stimulation, oxytocin, and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  The first little-known fact is that during pregnancy less oxytocin is released in response to nipple stimulation than when a woman is not pregnant.5<br>  <br>  But the key to understanding breastfeeding during pregnancy is the uterus itself. Contrary to popular belief, the uterus is not at the beck and call of oxytocin during the 38 weeks of the “preterm” period. Even a high dose of synthetic oxytocin (Pitocin) is unlikely to trigger labor until a woman is at term.6<br>  <br>  Instead, the uterus must actively prepare in order for labor to commence. You could say that there are two separate states of being for the uterus: the quiescent baby-holder and the active baby-birther. These states make all the difference to how the uterus responds to oxytocin, and so, one can surmise, to breastfeeding. While the baby is growing, the uterus is geared to have a muffled response to oxytocin; at term, the body’s preparations for labor transform the uterus in ways that make it respond intensely to oxytocin.<br>  <br>  Many discussions of breastfeeding during pregnancy mention “oxytocin receptor sites,” the uterine cells that detect the presence of oxytocin and cause a contraction. These cells are sparse up until 38 weeks, increasing gradually after that time, and increasing 300-fold after labor has begun.6,7 The relative scarcity of oxytocin receptor sites is one of the main lines of defense for keeping the uterus quiescent throughout the entire preterm period—but it is not the only one.<br>  <br>  A closer look at the molecular biology of the pregnant uterus reveals yet more lines of defense. In order for oxytocin receptor sites to respond strongly to oxytocin they need the help of special agents called “gap junction proteins”. The absence of these proteins renders the uterus “down-regulated,” relatively insensitive to oxytocin even when the oxytocin receptor site density is high. And natural oxytocin-blockers, most notably progesterone, stand between oxytocin and its receptor site throughout pregnancy. 8,9,10<br>  <br>  With the oxytocin receptor sites (1) sparse, (2) down-regulated, and (3) blocked by progesterone and other anti-oxytocin agents, oxytocin alone cannot trigger labor. The uterus is in baby-holding mode, well protected from untimely labor.4<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/natinduc.html#Semen" rel="nofollow">http://www.gentlebirth.org/archives/nati...</a><br>  Sexual Activity / Semen for Starting Labor<br>  <br>  A couple of contradictory studies:<br>  <br>  Sex close to due date may cause spontaneous labor, study finds - "Women who have sexual intercourse during late pregnancy are more likely than abstinent women to have a spontaneous delivery at 38 to 40 weeks' and less likely to require labor induction, according to results of a study conducted in Malaysia."<br>  <br>  Effect of Coitus at Term on Length of Gestation, Induction of Labor, and Mode of Delivery<br>  Peng Chiong Tan, Anggeriana Andi, Noor Azmi, M.

In particular, I have to ask whether it really makes sense that the group who is more sexually active had lower Bishop's score, i.e. the cervix was LESS ripe.  This is totally counter to the well-established practice of using prostaglandins (from real animal semen?) to ripen the cervix and induce labor.<br>  <br>  Let's also consider the methodology of the study . . . the women were only asked about sexual activity at prenatal appointments, not after labor had started.  This approach misses the class of women who aren't routinely sexually active in late term but who then successfully use sex as a way of starting labor.  Those women never made it to the next prenatal appointment!<br>  <br>  I also observe that this is another study that completely ignores the role of genetic heritage in the natural gestation length.  This is especially important because sexual practices in pregnancy often have a strong cultural foundation.  It's possible that if the researcher had asked the right questions at the right time, the real outcome of this study might have been that some ethnic groups with naturally longer gestations also have cultural prohibitions against sex during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you're trying to help stretch out the lower uterine segment and allow the baby to drop, more semen could only help. If you'd like the semen without the usual intercourse, you might consider collecting semen in a condom and applying it in some creative way. You could probably pinch the condom about an inch from the end, turn the rest inside out around your hand, insert the condom as high near your cervix as possible and then push the semen out near your cervix. Knee-chest for a while might help as well. I know of absolutely no studies about any of this, so you're on your own regarding how much effort this might seem worth.<br>  <br>  This brings to mind a rather funny conversation I once had with another midwife (Tip of the Year - avoid midwives in restaurants!) about creative ways to get semen onto a cervix. We had the idea of collecting it in condoms and then freezing it. I think we were originally considering this for a mom whose husband was away in the military, so we imagined that her husband could pre-freeze his semen before leaving into little POP-sicles. Or maybe we were calling them Prosta-Pops or something. The details blessedly escape me.<br>  <br>  It just occurred to me that it might be easier to get those empty gelatin capsules at the health food store and simply put the semen in there.<br>  <br>  Anyway, all of the above might be useful if you're adamant about getting the dad's semen onto your cervix.<br>  <br>  If you just want the baby to drop and aren't so picky about how that happens, you might want to consider herbs.<br>  <br>  I once worked with a mom whose first three babies had never dropped (all 3 c-secs). She started taking PN-6 late in pregnancy, and the baby engaged at 35 weeks. She was very happy and did go into spontaneous labor 7 weeks later. The extreme length of time between engagement and labor makes me think it was the herbs helping the lower uterine segment to soften and stretch. I'm not sure this is a great thing, as you then might have a baby's head uncomfortably engaged for longer than nature might do it. But you might consider it worth the gamble.<br>  <br>  Sex accompanied by manual or vibrator stimulation for effective climax along with depositing semen on the cervix. Or self stimulation via manual or vibrator with strong climactic reaction is also effective.  In particular, breast stimulation has been shown to ripen the cervix.<br>  Oral Application of Semen<br>  About fellatio: Actually, it would probably be beneficial, if the idea is to get the labour started. A great OB in Hamilton (John Lamont, I believe) spoke to our class about sexuality and pregnancy. He mentioned the concept that prostaglandins are absorbed 10X more efficiently through the gut than through the vaginal mucosa, with respect to semen and labour onset.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Make sure your partner ejaculates inside you. It is the semen that contains prostiglandins that soften the cervix. Make sure you orgasm with it. The orgasm will cause your body to produce Oxytocin, which is the body's natural form of the medication Pitocin that they use at the hospital to induce labor, which starts contractions. The more you do it the better chance you have of it working. I also suggest nipple stimulation. It too produces Oxytocin. Rub or gently pull and tug the nipples for 5 minutes every 15 minutes for 4 hours.  Both of these worked for my husband and I twice :) So we swear by it. If I make it to 39 weeks this time, I plan on trying it again. But keep in mind, if baby isn't ready..baby will not come :) Good Luck!!|`|vcxdTXbraa	it has nothing to do with how you have sex but that he cums inside of you. there is something about the sperm that causes you to release hormones to put you into labor|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	The type of sex doesn't matter...lol. It's the semen that helps soften your cervix. Prostaglandins in semen are what do the trick. :]|`|R21aV2mLaa	wow i am glad you asked this question, i was needing to know how to dilate further and now i have gotten my answers...so from what i hear semen is the trick, i am going to try that now!! ha ha! good luck to you and congrats!!|`|ZWVvtIK8aa	just keep doing it! try other things like nipple stimulation. nothing is working for me personally :( but we gotta keep trying lol right?|`|y5sWmbtnaa	Semen softens cervix (prostaglandins)<br>  And Orgasm (yours not his) can start contractions or aid them .|`|QI7EkuCQaa	hahah this made me laugh.<br>  <br>  i have no info but its funny how you have to have sex, because you had sex..if that made any sense|`|bo4MguzVaa	I heard it's the *** that actually does the trick.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Lol, I was always told rough sex will throw you into labor.

fdnbXfvfaa	My daughter shouted I want a cup cake when I read this so I will assume, she thinks you should go with cupcakes. But that is up to you.<br>  <br>  And no I don't think treat bags are a must. Why make more work and money spending on yourself when there is no need.<br>  <br>  And as an add in, my little one demands I tell you Chocolate cupcakes with sprinkles are they best.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	I'd do whatever is easiest/cheapest.  i don't think goody bags are essential for parties.  do must kids look forward to them, probably but its not mandatory.  if you feel as though you must, maybe include a seed packet and a shovel to get into the spring spirit or some small pool toy? not sure if that even exists.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	maybe cupcakes would be better then and maybe play like 30 minutes of games so they don't get cramps in the pool<br>  and u can get grab bags at the dollar store|`|gpON465Iaa	small cup cakes,<br>  yes to small treat bags, give them out as they depart.|`|rsR1O730aa	cupcakes, they are so much easier to just hand out and you dont have to get all the pieces cut and handed out. just tell them all to grab a cupcake and easy to clean up cause of no plates or forks.<br>  <br>  no treat bags aren't a must especially since they are just swimming if anything you could just have a bowl of random assortments of candy (like 5 pound mixed bag of stuff from wal mart) and just tell them they can take somethin if they want befor they go, but no you dont have to have treat bags. <br>  hope the party is fun :)|`|WADWJqEMaa	I personally think that cupcakes would be a better idea because guests don't have to wait for you to cut the cake. I think putting goggles, small pool toys, etc. in goodie bags when they come in would be adorable! They could play in the pool with them! I've done that before for my birthday. I'm not a parent, though... xD<br>  <br>  Have fun at the party!<br>  Kay|`|NtSQcyHLaa	I think cupcakes would be a better option. It's less messy, with no cutting, and it's self-cleaning when you throw away the wrapping. Also, you could just hand out party hats or noise makers or something, to take care of the party favors without having treat bags.|`|Al4Gcgalaa	do a few cupcakes and abit of cake then thers sumfing for evryone, <br>  you have to do party bags , because its just a thingg. x good look and happy birfday to your daughter :D|`|W16vRFTNaa	I think a cupcake cake, they are cute and if your at the pool it wont be a big mess you don't need plates just napkins to eat a cupcake.|`|nsbsbPpAaa	I THINK YOU SHOULD DO CUPCAKES...

AND YOU ALL WILL BE AT THE POOL ANYWAY|`|cwYGorpnaa	cupcakes<br>  treat bags are a must especially since they don't have games|`|iNvGnl0Xaa	Treat bags are not a must and 1/2 sheet cake sounds great!|`|j2mRop0laa	Treat bags are not a must. We always do them, but for a group that large- I wouldn't.<br>  <br>  Get a big bowl and put laffy taffy, blow pops, starburst, tootsie rolls in it and they can help themselves. Kids love candy at parties. There's the treat bag- they just enjoy it there.<br>  <br>  Go for whichever is cheaper for cake. At all the swimming parties we attend, a bunch of kids won't even leave the pool for cake and the cake just gets tossed. Just get whatever is cheap.|`|AkFag8tNaa	Cupcakes would be easier to deal with....no spatula/paper plates etc....and you are renting a pool, that's treat enough in my book:)

SSM3u4l4aa	Yes, take the test again. If it tests negative and you still think you might be, have the doctor give you a blood test or an ultrasound.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Retest now. It's been long enough. If it's still negative go to your doctor and have a blood test done. If it's STILL negative then you aren't pregnant and stress is really messing up your cycles.|`|SzMH2na0aa	I would go to the doctor's office because if you cycle is regular, there could be other problems if you are not pregnant and the doctor's office could give you a blood test which would be must more accurate then a Home Pregnancy Test.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|YB736Vwwaa	I'm definitely gonna need you to go to the doctor, it sounds as if your not producing enough HCG for a hpt to detect.

kaqPSgTVaa	Yeah. It just depends on where the baby is located.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Yea. I noticed that too. It all depends on what position the baby is laying in, and also it depends on how bloated you are and everything. Its nothing to worry about. good luck.|`|28QPS6V9aa	Yes it all depends on how your baby is laying. If his back is facing outwards then your stomach should be harder. Braxton hicks can also cause your stomach to feel tighter.

b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	outlet protectors would be #1 on the list.. then - rubber bands.. yes, rubber bands to put on handles of the cabinets, so that they cannot open (and you don't have to drill the wood to intall the latches).. on the other hand, if you are not planning on leaving your child home alone without supervision, you don't need anything else.. (just remember to close the doors to all bathrooms and basement)|`|3t9jZ89Oaa	I would agree with the other posters.  The only things you would actually need to buy would be gates (if you have stairs), outlet covers, and something to keep the cabinets where you keep cleaning products  and sharp knives closed. <br>  You should also secure any furniture that can be pulled or knocked over, but you can do this with items you probably have on hand - picture wire, eye hooks, etc.<br>  <br>  The best baby proofing is an alert  parent with a vivid imagination...<br>  <br>  for the person with cats - a kitchen counter worked for my friend.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	Honestly, with the exception of outlet protectors, you can probably get away without buying anything at all.<br>  <br>  The trick is to get on your hands and knees and crawl around your baby's travel areas. Remove anything breakable, sharp or not to be touched. You can use furniture to block off stairs (or buy gates), and use foam and tape to soften furniture and counter corners. Make sure all cords and 'pullables" are pulled up and out of reach. Make sure that nothing is left on end tables and counters that hover over the edge...and move any pet food and water out of the area. Make sure anything 'climbable' like stools and furniture are heavy enough for him/her not to flip over and become hurt with.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps some!|`|kGfd8DWWaa	Well those plastic outlets things are great and the have these cabinets lockers that you just put though the handles but I suggest the ones that you have to install, also they have this thing that you can put on the stove to lock it, they work great because sooner or latter they all learn how to open the oven...|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Baby gates are great.. electrical outlet covers are great... but in all honesty as the years pass I think the kids will do more damage to your home than any baby proofing item on the market. =)|`|IXBl5l5kaa	I agree you may not need to buy much. We bought a kit a few weeks ago because we bought our first house. I haven't even open it because we really don't need the cabinet latches or the door knob covers... plus I cant find the kit anyway lol. The Safety 1st company makes zip-tie like products that wrap around handles of cabinets that can be loosened and tightened and don't actually attach to the cabinet with screws. You can find all of that stuff at Walmart of Target witht he baby gates.<br>  <br>  I agree with post #1. She had some great tips. We are still trying to figure out what to do with the cat food bowls. Jaiden got to the water bowl today and tipped it over. She is VERY intrigued by the cats so she followed them to their food. I have no idea what to do about their food... they need to access it too :\

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	You can ask for sure. It will be up to him if he decides to do it. Some Dr's will and some won't. But if you are 38 weeks, he might. So if that is something you want I would def. mention it. . Good Luck!|`|Hcj8k1bXaa	My doc did it at my last couple appointments without me even knowing she was doing it!  I knew it was slightly more uncomfortable than normal exams but I didn't think anything of it.  My last weekly appointment that I had that she did it at, I started contracting like crazy for about 3 hours afterward.  I called my doc after they started because I hadn't had any contractions at all at 37 weeks and I wasn't sure what was going on.  My doc just kind of laughed and said yeah that can happen then explained what she did.  Had no idea! LOL  Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to kick me into labor, but at least I knew what contractions felt like after that. :) By all means ask your doc, like pp stated, as long as your cervix is up to it, I'm certain your doc will be happy to do it for you.|`|azE51WGRaa	Sure, I'd ask them. Since you're full-term and they don't want you carrying to your due date I'm sure they'd have no problems doing this. Good luck and let us know how it goes =D|`|35kVNi5oaa	yup.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sure you can request it, and you bet the doc will if your cervix is favorable.  It can help but there is no guarantee that it will start labor.

Becca is a really cute nickname too.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|ppE0GtkIaa	awwww...I think its beautiful and I love the other names you have, especially Jack, Emma and Sarah...I love it!! :o) My daughters best friend is Rebecca and they call her Becca..:o)|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Congratulations!!  Beautiful name and perfect with her brothers and sisters!<br>  <br>  Okay.  Now can we start planning names for #7?  We don't know the sex, yet...<br>  <br>  TX Mom lol lol lol lol|`|34VXCyvVaa	Very nice.|`|e882970a70bc3067939bb37ff8b1e6b8aa	I think I know what the answerer meant on too harsh.  For example, my daughter is Sierra and I considered Danica for my second.  Sierra sounds softer than Danica.  Emma, Sarah and Hannah sound soft, but Rebecca sounds like a hard k sound.  A name that would go good would be like Karina.  Rebecca is fine, though, but I HATE Becky.|`|BcdbR6iSaa	I like the nickname Becca, but I don't like Rebecca too much.<br>  If you like it, that's all that counts. It does fit well with your other kids names!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and congratulations!!|`|NePgB9b2aa	I think it's a very sweet, strong name. A little plain for my taste, but very traditional and it should serve her well in life.|`|NCPHjXhmaa	No Good! Try Tallulah! Now there's a name!|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	I love the name Rebecca.  It fits really well with the other names you listed, too.  :)|`|R1eten5Haa	I like it! :-)|`|VHHis05Naa	Beautiful and goes great with other kids' names.|`|AA11138222	I don't think it fits all that well with the other names. It's too harsh compared to the other names. Becca sounds nice with the others, but Becca Susanne doesn't sound that great.<br>  <br>  I would suggest Bethany, but in the end it's up to you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: All of you other children have softer sounding names. I don't know how to explain it any different. Emma, Sarah, and Hannah have the same type of soft, sweet sound, and Rebecca just doesn't fit to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!
DpOF55c9aa	I dont think it is an obvious no. My bf and I talk about marriage. There is no way we can afford it right now or really want to get married right now, but we do in the future. I am in your situation. I think I read about someone else who was also 17 and pregnant. <br>  <br>  I think you should talk to him and explain. Talk about getting married in the future and if he really wants to get engaged then you could think about getting engaged but just not married for a little while.<br>  <br>  My bf and I are moving out together. I'm nearly 27 weeks pregnant. How far are you?<br>  <br>  Which country do you live in? I live in Australia.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk my email is f.walters@live.com<br>  <br>  I think its great that you are keeping the baby. <br>  <br>  Stay positive. If you love him and he loves you it should work out in the end. He should realise that being with you and not being married it still better than not having you and his child in his life.<br>  <br>  Oh.. and to the person called animal lover. Having a baby young is not a mistake. Its an unforeseen path that we just have to mould our life around. Being about to have a baby is a wonderful thing. You should'nt make people feel bad for that. What do you say about the teens that get abortions? What about the women that cant have kids or left it to late?|`|xEYMD8I4aa	I agree, you should be focussing on the baby for now and getting engaged later.<br>  <br>  But then again, many teen parents would kill for their bf to propose to them, I think you should have talked to him.|`|8soR3hLoaa	Awh :(<br>  I'm 17 and pregnant too and still with my boyfriend. <br>  We're not engaged or anything, but we talk about marriage down the road. <br>  But, I think you should talk to him and tell him you still want to be with him and want him there with you to raise the baby together, and then after a few years maybe the two of you talking about marriage again. He probably just really got his hopes up when he proposed, thinking you'd say yes, so that's why he may have reacted the way he did, not expecting you to say no. But if you just explain to him how much you really do love him and want to be with him, and just don't want to rush the marriage yet, I'm sure he will understand.<br>  Good luck!|`|ysvOGwVHaa	Hmmm...tough one here...<br>  <br>  First of all, no, it is not an obvious no.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I think that if you didn't want to deal with adult things, you should not have been having sex at 17 and making a baby.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, unless there are other, unrelated items that you haven't mentioned here that make you have reservations as to whether or not you ever want to marry this guy...then what is the problem? Why not get married?<br>  <br>  I think that it was really noble of him to come to you and want you to be his wife and for him to be responsible for you and the baby and own up to the mistakes he has made and want to be an adult about it.<br>  <br>  Yes, I understand your hesitation, but wouldn't it be a good thing to keep your child's parents together? If you run him off, then your child will probably end up going through several other "daddies" before you choose a man. I am not saying this against anyone, just the experience of what I have seen with a lot of my friends.<br>  <br>  Unless there is some major issue like abuse or drugs or something that makes you not want to be with him, I suggest you reconsider. And this is a lot coming from me. I am not a huge proponent of teenage marriages...but then again I am not particularly fond of how many teenagers are getting pregnant these days either.<br>  <br>  You made an adult choice and I think it's time you grow up and deal with it.<br>  <br>  IMHO|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Oh my gosh!!! He broke up with you? I got best answer on your question on what to say to him!!!<br>  <br>  Just try to talk him! Tell him you do love him and want to be with him but just not engaged just yet. Tell him you want to be with him and (live?) with him but you just can't get engaged yet. Or you could accept the engagement and just not get married for a few years and be betrothed.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I'm soooo incredibly sorry!!!<br>  <br>  God bless and I hope everything turns out better.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	He asked a question here to.<br>  He showed your link.<br>  I think he was upset that you said you had to think about it.<br>  I don't want to cause trouble between you though<br>  So I don't know if I should send you the link to the question.<br>  If you want it. Edit<br>  But don't blame me :)<br>  I hope you feel better.|`|3irrWRUWaa	you should explain to him your reasons for not wanting to get married right now,maybe he'll be a little more understanding and not so upset with you. you guys are young. i agree with you that  you should focus on the baby for now and when both of you are ready then you get married.|`|hTieELhTaa	aww sweetie just give it some time! He is prolly hurt he might feel like he is doing the right thing by you by asking you to marry him. He just might not understand your reason for not saying yes. He might think the only reason for saying no is that you dont love him. Give it time then try to explain exactly how you feel|`|e882970a70bc3067939bb37ff8b1e6b8aa	I totally understand where you are coming from and if you have reservations, you did the right thing.  However, I have to give the guy props.  It was very noble of him to "do the right thing" and want to make this family work.  Good luck in everything!|`|d6c5091f4ae22232c337d5a7245302feaa	Do you know how many pregnant teens would kill to have the father of their baby step up and ask to marry them?
bR4BgFLlaa	You need to go with your gut instinct or you will possibly spend the rest of your life regretting it. If you're not ready to be a mother, don't have the baby. It won't be good for either of you. Since your ex won't be around anyway you can't afford to be swayed by him. Its is your life and your choice, don't take it lightly and don't make a decision for anyone but yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Nu5IvjQ2aa	if you want an abortion it is your decision and your body. You will be the mother of this baby and he wont even be around and why would you want his parents taking care of your baby, i would get an abortion|`|IoWoDxG8aa	The next time he asks you if you need anything, tell him that you need him...to call more or be there for you more. It seems like you are scared that you will have a baby all alone and so you resort to abortion. It is your choice for abortion and there are people on here that will tell you not to do it. You need to think about what is best for you but you also need to think that this isn't some easy decision and that literally, you are taking someone's life into your own hands. Take responsibility for th actions you have done. <br>  I don't think that you really have a right to be upset that he only texts you every two days-you haven't said anything to him about calling more. Now if you talked to him about calling more and he still didnt do anything different then you would have a right to complain. Don't expect a man to read your mind.. They think differently than us women.|`|d6c5091f4ae22232c337d5a7245302feaa	1) It is 50 percent your fault; you had sex.  Pregnancy can be a consequence of sex, which I'm sure you knew.<br>  <br>  2) It's your body and your decision.  Leave everyone else out of it and go with what will be best for you.|`|5puE2Qfpaa	No one will give you advice in this situation!!! We are all together trying to save our babies and help our babies to be healthy!!! SORRY! WRONG question if you want an abortion!|`|kBcI3Uleaa	Look Girl, you need to do what your gut tell's you! There's a lot of factor's in this situation, but you only have so much time!<br>  I was in the same situation, my boyfriend at the time came from a wealthy proper family and I am just a middle class country girl. We were together for two years almost my birth control was working great so after testing for a year and we were both clean we decided to have sex without a condom. Needless to say I got pregnant and I was so scared to tell him because he worked alot on the family buisness he was in colledge and getting his life together after his baby sister just dying. He was really never around we only saw eachother on the weekends,so I broke down and told him. All he kept saying was that he can't have a kid right now, his parents will kill him, bla bla bla. It hurt me I wanted the child so bad because I felt like there was something missing in my life so I decided I was going to keep it. And he kust kept having attitude about it an our relationship grew further apart. And I thought about it one night and I sat up going through the pro and cons. I felt that it wouldn't be fair bringing a helpless child into this world without stability and finacally. Especially if he didn't want anything to do with it, it would put a burden on the child when it got older knowing his o her father didn't want anything to do with it. So I finally made the decision to abord it and I went to the clinic I had the appointment I was sitting there in Planned Parenthood , filling out one of the many they have you fill out and I walked up to the receptionist and told her I couldn't do it! So I went home and I kept thinking and thinking about what to do. Later that night around 9p.m I started having alot of pain and I felt moisture so i went into the bathroom and  ended up having a miscarriage, at first when I left the emergency room I was sad, but at the same time relieved. God made the decision for me. It's very hard but I believe that it was meant to be. Good luck!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    d                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <br>  Now the father does have some say but if he isn't coming back and he can't finacially take care of you and that  baby  it's going to be to hard on you. Being a single mom is very hard! Also I think it's a huge burden and wrong to put a newborn under the care of his parents. That's just nuts, and he says you can still be apart of it's life but the further you two fall apart and theres less communication things will get sour. The Grandparents will get attached and get defensive and paranoid that you can take the baby away anytime you want. How are you suppose to have a relationship with him when he's not there? And if you have the child and he gets older and he see's his or her father for a week or for a couple of days and then not seeing there dad for along time is confusing. I'm probably not making any easier for your decision. It's a torn decision,theres good that can come out of it, depending on how strong of a person you are and if you want to give up your life and time for a while, putting it on hold so you can raise this child then you could make everything work. But if you don't feel strong enough and that you can't give this baby a good life then it's not fair to bring it into this world.|`|ROVAg1vvaa	well the only one who can make this decision is you, its your body your baby. you know he isn't going to be around so in my opinion he has no say. and why would he think he does? and its not his parents job to raise the baby, they didn't make the baby its not their responsibility. if you want an abortion that is entirely up to you. it may sound wrong but whatever, you can get an abortion and always tell him you miscarried. just an idea if you are that against the pregnancy. good luck|`|YB736Vwwaa	First, raising a child is hard w/2 parents, its even harder w/ him in the marines. You need to be honest with him right away before he starts getting his hopes up. Keep it real, he'll be mad but he has to respect it.<br>  <br>  Second, who the h**l are they to raise your child?<br>  <br>  Get out of this situation now!|`|3MsuKdNFaa	well its not fair that he said that his parents are gonna take care of it.. its your baby. but i dont think abortion is the best way to go but i guess everyone has their own choice. but you need to talk to him about it and tell him what you want. and he just needs to know. he cant stop you from doing anything. but you can ask help from friends or parents if you decide to keep the baby. but idk. its all your choice. but i gotta say this, my brother just had a baby a month ago and i cant even imagine life without her anymore.. but it is your choice. so if ur getting an abortion fer sure i really think you should tell him before you do it|`|OhYE3GhKaa	I think this is very sad. One thing you have to remember is that your hormones are all out of whack when you get pregnant. this is true for all women, but in your case it is even harder with all your confusion.<br>  <br>  it is wonderful that he loves his baby already. that is an experience that not all women get to have.<br>  <br>  here's the thing. If you don't want the baby, you should think about giving it to his parents. apparently they and their son do want it. You would have the best of both worlds if they let you visit whenever you want<br>  <br>  You say you want the abortion 'because he won't be around' that is a reason for you to be disappointed no doubt. but the baby is not at fault and should not be punished because of him

This is more of a practical consideration than it is a legal one, because one of the predominant reasons that many parents give for wanting to place their children for adoption is that they feel as single parents, they will not be able to give their children the attention, care and opportunities that it could have if it were raised in a two-parent family. So even though single parents are some of the hardest working people in the world, if birthparents feel it is important for their children to be placed in two-parent families, that is what will happen.|`|UViJ899Daa	they can adopt a child as long as they are able to take care of the child and they meet the criteria to be qualified as a parent..|`|LIGYejglaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  To adopt from China, for instance, a couple has to be married. It's one of their (many) requirements.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	Absolutely!  I work with a single woman in her forties who has adopted a son from china :)|`|LmvWzsKZaa	you can go to Africa,,, have one or more,,, they are lovely <br>  <br>  and yes you can adapt|`|evEJxv06aa	yes you can i mean if others can than why not you right.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	although a bit harder to adopt yes you sure the hell can GO FOR IT|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	It depends.<br>  <br>  For US domestic and foster care adoption, yes singles can adopt.  Now, some adoption agencies may not work with singles.. that's their perogative, so a single PAP may have to "shop around". <br>  <br>  International adoptions depends on the rules of the county involved.  The criteria for adoptive parents is set by the country in question.  Some programs, like China for example, do not allow single parents to adopt.  Other programs will allow it.<br>  <br>  ETA: China used to allow single parents to adopt, but not anymore.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	it depends where you want to adopt them from.<br>  china, i believe requires there to be two parents present.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	Yes.  I am single and adopted a baby back in 2005.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	In what country? In the UK they can, in US I think it varies in different states.
0KTPq92saa	If you are worried about becoming pregnant, and have had the unprotected sex within the past 72 hours you should consider getting the Plan B pill. Otherwise, an accurate pregnancy test could be taken  a week after missing your period.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can test as early as 10 days but it won't be accurate until about 14 most likely. Most women don't get accurate results until then. You would have been close to your ovualtion day so it's possible.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Its always best to just wait until you miss your period. If you miss your period then the HGC hormones will be a lot higher then before your miss period|`|SmWuSrHYaa	You were prolly close to your ovulation date so it is very possible that you are pregnant. I found out 5 days before my missed period at the dr' s office through a simple urine test. I would test then or wait until you miss your period. I know..... it sucks waiting!!|`|5puE2Qfpaa	From the first day of your period up until day 16 is usually your most fertile time. They usually say 2 weeks before your next period. Unless in fact you ovulate later.|`|35kVNi5oaa	wait until you miss you period.|`|FzZQsK89aa	next time have protected sex and u dont have to worry about it.
SSM3u4l4aa	Could be your cervix trying to dilate.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I am 37 weeks..2 cms..and 80% effaced. I get the same feelings. I asked my Dr this just 2 days ago and she said it is just probably nerves in the cervix or uterus and the baby being lower in my pelvis pressing down.  She said it is just my body doing it's thing to get ready :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	sounds like your cervix maybe dilating more? I'm getting that and whew it sucks takes my breath away could also be the baby moving down more good luck|`|DErBSfZgaa	your cervix is dilating [getting opened up]<br>  because the baby is getting closer to coming out :)
24072a527355deb8895a64a72f7622f1aa	I use the gerber nuk.  It really is just personal preference for what you and your baby like.  <br>  <br>  I intentionally got one that was not shaped like the breast so that there was no confusion for him.<br>  <br>  I gave him the pacifirer when he was just hours old, and have not really had problems with breastfeeding.  There was no confusion, the nipples are shaped differently, one has food and one does not, that is not that hard for them to figure out.|`|9b579e5d0c20c6295a54289ea1d57053aa	OK, I am going to give my 2 cents worth here about pacifiers. First of all why do you need to give your baby a pacifier? If you haven't had your baby yet why would you plan on giving him/her a pacifier? What they don't knwo won't hurt them and they will not become attached to it. If a baby needs something or to suck on something you don't need to give a pacifier. Also, when you are breastfeeding you do not want to introduce a pacifier due to nipple confusion. Especially when they baby is so young. If your baby needs to suck then give it your breast, not a pacifier. Sucking on a nipple is different than a pacifier and there really is no pacifier that is like the nipple. If you don't need to introduce one then don't. It saves you in the long run of trying to get your child to stop using it. I hate seeing kids that are like 3or 4 and still using a pacifier! But this is probably because they are so attached to it and had it as such a young age. I am no professional but I am a mom of 2 boys and breastfed both and are still with my 6 month old and not one had a pacifier. There really is no need for it. It's just another product out there to suck you into to buying it. But if you choose so then you will just have to experiment and see which one your baby likes.|`|qImMwhUHaa	My breastfed babies used Nuk or the ones that were similar in shape. Normally they will take whatever you first give them and they get used to. I waited a few days before I gave my babies artificial nipples so they wouldn't get "nipple confusion". Every baby is different. Some don't ever even take a pacifier.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	We did not offer my daughter a pacifier for a few weeks in order to ensure she did not get nipple confusion and to assist with my supply. After that iw anted to see if she would take one. We tried SEVERAL and the best we found were the Playtex OrthoPro pacifiers. <br>  <br>  Honestly she barely took it, mostly only if we held it in her mouth as she could not seem to keep in on her own but it helped her in the car and other times I was unable to immediately nurse. After a month or two we just threw the paci out all together since it was such a hassle. I'm the pacifier which is cool with me lol.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	There are no pacifiers shaped like the breast.  It is a totally different latch to latch on a breast compared to sticking a plug in the mouth.
ppE0GtkIaa	Lily Rose ....yes I give it a 10+ Its beautiful :o)<br>  Lucy Elizabeth...I love Lucy but not crazy about Elizabeth, sorry<br>  Ella Ruby....give it a 8<br>  Jordan Mae...give it a 7|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Yes I do. Ella Ruby is my favourite!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|34VXCyvVaa	Lucy Elizabeth is nice.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Very nice! I like all except for Jordan.|`|8WbfmK5daa	I think they are all really nice.<br>  <br>  Lily Rose is so cute I love it.<br>  <br>  Im personally not a big fan of the name Lucy but there is nothing wrong with it. Elizabeth is a gorgeous name very classic and traditional.<br>  <br>  Ella Ruby is just beautiful. So pretty and feminine.<br>  <br>  Jordan Mae is quite cute. Jordan is cute a masculine name in my opinion even though it unisex but they sound cute together.<br>  <br>  Hard to decide but I think Lily Rose is my favourite :)<br>  <br>  Rose is my daughter's middle.|`|vw7ebwgnaa	Jordan Mae is my favorite. I also like Lily Rose and Lucy Elizabeth. I'm not sure I really like Ruby but I like Ella.|`|fKCWfCviaa	I wish you would switch them upp.<br>  <br>  Ella Rose!!<br>  Lucy Elizabeth<br>  Lily Mae<br>  <br>  and i don't really like Jordan or Ruby.|`|xCeaVqItaa	Jordan Mae<br>  Lucy Elizabeth<br>  Ella Ruby|`|zJyYbnZ0aa	Lily Rose|`|hyG0c5Nnaa	I like the first two.|`|b77a399b601ebea9dfd2bbfd3203079caa	no|`|zaME9Hdoaa	I like Lily, Lucy and Ella<br>  <br>  not Jordan, that should be a boys name.|`|EccBqsntaa	They're really plain.
6TGCrO80aa	My husband and I are looking into the exact same situation.Adopting an older child is not very different from adopting an infant, save from the fact that with your brother you will have to get your/his parents to terminate their parental rights. Having custody helps but it is not the same. Other than this potentially difficult and tasking step (depending on how willing your/his parents are to give up their rights) the adoption should have the same requirements as an infant or a non-relative adoption. In some states (not sure if Nevada is one) it is required that the potential adoptee has lived with the relatives for a fixed period of time and bonded in a significant way before the adoption process can begin. I wish you and your brother the best luck, we have a good idea of what is going on in your hearts and minds at the moment.|`|AA12127693	You need to hire an adoption attorney to get the ball rolling.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	A family law or adoption attorney should do the trick.|`|wsRCZ1Mtaa	<a href="http://dcfs.state.nv.us/DCFS_PlaceRes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dcfs.state.nv.us/DCFS_PlaceRes.ht...</a><br>  <br>  These are the folks who have the answers to your question,<br>  and here is the form to get the ball rolling:<br>  <a href="http://www.dcfs.state.nv.us/FC%20JOINT%20APPLICATION%2009-1-01.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dcfs.state.nv.us/FC%20JOINT%2...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!
imFpyj7Gaa	My miscarriage sounds just like yours, the only difference was that my period was not that heavy, but it was heavy. I was on my 2 round of clomid and I got pregnant, but I didn't know because my period started when it was suppose too. So after 3 weeks of me bleeding I went to the ER and they told me that I was pregnant. So they took blood and checked my hcg levels and told me that I was very early in my pregnancy and to go home and keep my legs up and come back in a week to check my levels again. I went back and my levels had went down and they told me that I had miscarried. I continue to bleed for a whole month after they told me. So I bleed altogether 2 months. It was coming and going just the same way as you. Spotting here and there, going off and coming back on and sometimes get heavy all over again. I didn't need a D&C either, because it was so early in my pregnancy. But after I finally finish bleeding I went back to my Dr and he gave me clomid again. The only difference this time was that, he gave my metformin and told me to take it everyday til I got a positive result on my hpt. And on my second round again, two days before my period was due I took a hpt and got a positive. I carried to full term and had a healthy 9lbs 1oz little boy, who is now 2 and bad as every. So just wait til you finish bleeding and go back to your dr to make sure everything is on the up and up. And when he/she say it's good, start trying again. Good luck, and I hope I helped in any way.
