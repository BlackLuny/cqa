It almost seems the unit is not getting enough power... When the compressor kicks on, the fan slows (room lighting dims) until it clicks off again. Could it be a power issue? or do I need a new compressor (or new unit entirely)? I've cleaned the coils and the filter. It's not an air-flow problem. No leaks. Therm. seems to be fine. It has been working well all summer. The problems only started yesterday...one of the hottest days of the summer. Also, when I removed the cover to look for cloging, I noticed that the compressor was extremely hot. Not hot enough to burn me, but definitely uncomfortable to touch.

20061026221733AAbbS7J	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	New boiler  condensing questions?	Have a new weil 155 ultra gas hot water boiler (no external hot water) For experiment, the temp outside was 45 deg and home temp was 62 deg.  The water temp in boiler was reading 66 deg.  I turned thermostat up to 71 and about an hour and a half to two hours later the house was heated including basement and two upper floors to correct temp.  I estimated the gas used at 3-3 1/2 cubic feet or about 4 dollars. What I am unsure about is after the home is heated the water temp in the boiler will continue to fall and fall from say 155 to 90 or less and then the boiler will fire for a while and maintain temp.  Over a period of say 6 hours this may consume 2-3 more cf of gas.  According to the guy who installed it, he thinks the system has 25 gallons or so of water, but I dont think he really knew.  I;m hoping one of the great yahoo experts can tell me this scenario sounds correct/  Thanks

Ciao a tutti,      da un po' noto che ad ogni scarico dell'acqua del water, subito dopo, c'è un fischio (piuttosto forte).       Non comprendo da che potrebbe dipendere... forse c'è da cambiare qualche pezzo dentro al sifone (si chiama così il contenitore dell'acqua?).      Che fare?       Grazie a tutti.
