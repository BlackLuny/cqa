Although arrest itself is not evidence of guilt, I have no doubt the circumstances of his arrest will be reviewed, as it should. His just consequence is of no significance. It is the victimization of others that is of concern.    He should check with the State Board to find out if they would consider evidence of rehabilitation (extended counseling etc). His education however, will not be wasted, he can always work as a paralegal. The rules of the Supreme Court is as follows:        1-14 Background Investigations.        1-14.1 Purpose. The primary purposes of the character and fitness investigation before admission to The Florida Bar are to protect the public and safeguard the judicial system.        1-14.2 Responsibility.

PI8VfiY1aa	I'm going to answer you as honestly as possible. I hope you can appreciate a viewpoint from the other side of the isle :) Please read, I want to answer your question respectfully.     =========    The constitution is designed in such a way as to not give one branch too much power. That is the very essence of the separation of powers our forefathers wrote in articels 1, 2, and 3 of the Constitution (link below). For example, congress may narrowly pass a bill, say 52% yea - 48% nay, but a Presidential veto will send it back to congress, this time requiring a 66% yea. When democrats only hold a slight congressional majority (they held 51senate seats before the last election), it becomes increasingly hard to override a presidential veto because they then have to lobby republicans to vote in their favor. Can you imagine how hard it is for democrats having to lobby an additional 16% worth of republican support when they couldn't even get a single republican to support this last bill that passed yesterday?     I'm not trying to make a case for one side or the other- all I'm saying is that the powers are divided. If one party only holds a slight majority (like the democrats did), the president will have more power. Now, if the democrats held a 2/3 majority in congress, then Congress would've had more power because they easily could've overridden a presidential veto. So to answer your question- it depends on the above. In this case, I would respectfully argue that the democrats majority wasn't big enough to override the president's vetos, therefore democrats couldn't get legislation passed, therefore you cannot blame them. It's not political bias- only fairness.     Also- What did the democratic congress do to make the economy bad? Some would argue that republicans lifted the government regulations which protected foreclosure victims- those regulations were put in place after the great depression to "firewall" another great depression.     Have you ever heard of Phil Gramm? He was McCain's economic adviser. He pushed through congress a major deregulation bill in 2000 which was a huge component in the mortgage meltdown. As you know- the housing crisis caused the credit crisis, which is causing the massive job losses today. If you really want the truth about who to blame, read this article.    http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/...    ===    Look, my party has screwed up in the past, and I'll admit it. And not all republicans have bad ideas. But republican deregulation is probably more responsible this time around. Admitting that does not make you less of a republican- it just makes you able to hear both sides of the story.     And that's the problem with the American political system today- no one wants to hear both sides of the story...don't you agree?     hope this helped. Good luck|`|0fcefe7b3b3040b88a2ce7cb59ea8900aa	Republicans held a majority in both houses of Congress from 1995 until this most recent election, with the exception of an even Senate twice. Where is this Democratic Congress you speak of?    Ahh.. yeah there was a Democratic majority in the House for the last two years. I missed that part. The Senate was still even. But you still can't claim that the "Democratic Congress" is the cause of the poor economy, or that they started the Iraq War. The war started in 2003, when the Senate was 51-48 in favor of Republicans (1 independent), and the House was 229-205 in favor of Republicans (1 independent). I find it funny how Republicans were furious at Democrats for opposing Bush's war plans, and now that the war is unpopular, Republicans are trying to blame Dems for it.    Furthermore, a quick read of the Constitution would answer this for you. Remember hearing about "balance of powers" in elementary school?
yvPA8FSsaa	Regardless of the issue, I only support laws that control criminal behavior.  What difference does it make if someone robs, assaults or murders another person with a firearm, a knife or a baseball bat?  These things happen all the time, yet we only restrict firearms.      The argument that a firearm can do much more damage to more people is bogus, too.  In New York in 1990, one man with a quart of gasoline got angry with his ex-girlfriend.  He started a fire in the stairwell of the Happy Land Social Club where she was partying.  He killed 87 people.  No firearm involved at all.      It is not the gasoline that is responsible so when a shooting occurs why is it the gun's fault?  The problem is people willing to use something for evil.        Criminals get guns illegally.  By definition, criminals will not follow any law you make regarding firearms.  They can steal them from the police, military or security personnel just as easily as they can steal them anywhere else.  Importation of Cocaine is illegal yet it does not stop millions of pounds from being successfully smuggled in every year.  So can firearms.    Do you recall Bernie Goetz?  He was the so called "Subway Vigilante".   In 1984, robberies in the New York Subway System were way out of hand.  One day, some hoodlums tried to rob a meek little guy named Bernie Goetz.  He pulled out a hand gun and shot them, then disappeared into the crowd.     The most notable thing about this incident was played down in the news at the time.  But, for several weeks no one knew who this "vigilante" was.  During that time the rate of violent crime in the Subways went to zero.  Why do you suppose that is?  Could it be that the criminals were now afraid?  Afraid that if they tried to rob someone, another person may be a vigilante and shoot them?  You bet!    *|`|BmIgpoPlaa	I have my CCW permit.

Those are manufactured for one thing: killing.  I think in order for a civilian to get their hands on them, they should have something more than just a license for a fire arm.  it should be harder to get than a concealed weapon permit.  and finally, i think we need to focus on teaching our younger members of society that guns are tools.  not toys.  not weapons.  they're a means of survival and if operated correctly can be "fun" in a recreational sense.|`|aI6QFXClaa	No, I have a concealed weapon. I had  a back ground investigation and everything. Its our right to defend our self's why should the criminals be the only ones with gun's?|`|bQLQdRBZaa	Yes.    Law abiding Americans have every right to own firearms for legitimate purposes. However, as Justice Scalia pointed out in the "DC gun ban" case last year, federal, state, and local authorities have the right to regulate and restrict firearm ownership and use where it is in the public interest, so long as it does not have the effect of prohibiting ownership.    If someone has a legitimate reason to carry a concealed weapon, then they should be able to get a license to do so. But there is clearly a public safety interest in making sure those who do are law-abiding and responsible. So I do support requiring licenses for carrying--concealed or not. And no law-abiding citizen would object to getting  a license to conceal and carry. Only someone with criminalintend would have any objection.

The end product is that British manufacturing has decayed, whilst the retail industry was cashing in on cheap products and over inflated prices. The economy was a one horse race called retailing, and when the horse dropped dead, the economy died with it.    With no manufacturing industry to cushion the blow the UK economy fell like falling concrete. The Government wants to stimulate the economy by making more credit available, so we can resume the activity that got us in the mess in the first place!!    This problem was inevitable, anyone with a brain cell knew it would happen, Gordon Brown boasts that he predicted it ten years ago, he does not boast that he did nothing to help avert the disaster we now have.    The Government alone are powerless to remedy the consequences of their incompetence, the power is in the consumers hands, to stop supporting Chinese industry and start supporting UK industry.

mkMJYIJOaa	Cuts/   They are spending it faster than we can make it$$$$$$$$$$$$ It's get even time--and obama is going to bankrupt us--in favor of his trillions in spending--and to redecorate--all michelle's taste is in her mouth.|`|lWZi2p70aa	Interesting question!    Well, let us gather our wits and think about this one.  Leading by example in a time when reduced consumer spending is part of the problem?  If they cut back, then we will cut back, reducing the amount of economic activity further still, making recovery even more difficult.    A huge part of this crisis was consumers living beyond their means, with full encouragement from banks and lending institutions and ridiculously puffed up real estate prices.--in other words, the economy became overheated.  But now, it is supercooled.    And the folks who lead companies are worsening the situation by reducing economic activity further still, closing factories and plants and laying off workers.    Perhaps te best thing they can do is keep spending at the same level at the White House (well, maybe no more half-million dollar China sets).    OK, so maybe 5 Chefs is excessive.  Chef's can always find work, so if we drop two, perhaps that money should be used to create three new jobs.    You do NOT improve this situation by closings and lay-offs.  Of course if several large companies went totally bankrupt and put us in a depression, perhaps we could get back to free-competition capitalism for a while, and perhaps that would be worth the price of years standing in bread lines and eating at soup kitchens, because at least we would be freed from the yoke of these ridiculous corporate organisms who put the bottom line ahead of human survival.    But whatever they do at the White House is unlikely to have much effect one way or the other except as a leadership example.  And an example of diminished confidence would be interesting, but not perhaps what you, as questioner, are really hoping for.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	Come on now, don't you want to pay for cocktail parties every time he gets his own way with passing a bill, lol

They would send the rest of the needed information to you to fill out.  You would have to provide proof that you can  afford the school costs and living expenses.  For a four year program, it should cost you $250,000.00, approximately.    While in school, you would not be allowed to work, other than for 20 hours for the college you would be attending.

General rule of thumb is as long as it is covered by a t-shirt and pants you are fine.  You look at the Navy of the past and everyone has tattoos of naked ladies, anchors, etc all up and down their forearms.  The new Navy is a more professional appearance and tattoos on the forearm are seen as not professional.  But with a waiver you will be good.|`|PPKuHl9baa	You'll be fine. If you have to have it removed they'll do it after you leave bootcamp most likely. I've SERVED with people with tattoos on their hands, forearms, necks, legs, chests, etc. The only thing I haven't seen is a tattoo on someones face. I've seen guys with sleeves from their shoulder to their knuckles. I say keep it up. Tattoos are a Navy tradition and it's one that should be carried on regardless of how "professional" they become. I've aquired several while I was in. Don't forget to get your pig and **** on your feet so you don't drown. That's a classic. If you end up in Hawaii make sure to get your koi. Take it easy.
wqgBi10Gaa	I call myself African American.  I also use the term black. I know next to nothing about Africa and I understand that Africans resent my use of this term.    Can't please everybody. Seems in this case, I can't please ANYbody.    I still use this term.  As far as some people are concerned, the fact of my dark skin and kinky hair means that my social rank is forever pre-determined.    Just the word Africa is a source of derision among many nationals.  I use the term in order to express the fact that I face that EVERyday and won't shy away from that negative opionion.  I'm not on welfare and have never been.  I didn't get special treatment at school or at work.  If companies/schools didn't want me - I was out, period.    I don't think I'm taking anything away from other Americans, Africans or the US black community by calling myself African American.  Call yourself what you want and I'll do the same.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well I actually think that a lot of Americans who have ancestors from another country, when talking about their ethnic heritage, use a hyphenated form like "Italian-American" or "Japanese-American."  I think some black people are annoyed by the fact that they are the only ethnic group that is identified only by the color of their skin.  However, it's not offensive or wrong to call someone black, especially if, as in your case,  it's your preferred term.  The point is that people ought to be called what they wish to be called.|`|X40Ww89qaa	i just call you guys black|`|CN7klGgbaa	White people like to say all blacks come from africa, so whites like using the term to! The people at STORMFRONT and DAVID DUKE always call themselves European-Americans but i don't see you complaining about them! Its about labeling people to try to control them, and not all black people use this term. Mostly whites do! i am black, i say american, i don't let someone i don't know tell me i am from a country that i am not from.|`|zwaXYoRbaa	An African friend of mine told me he thinks it's really funny when a black American likes to call themselves "African-American" cuz they don't know the first thing about what it means to be African. They also probably couldn't name ten countries in Africa nor where they're located on the continent. I don't see what's wrong with just calling them Americans. Soon,..there are just gonna be too many nationalities mixed up in one person to be naming all of them.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	I was raised with them being called Neegro, then Colored, then Black, then African American.    I chose none of these terms for them.  It was not left up to me.  If I was to decide I would just call them people.  My mother was Mexican and she raised me to be color blind.  I don't like having to hang a tag on everybody to separate us.  I think we should find some tag that binds us together...    Hello fellow Earthlings...|`|QGuxbItCaa	If you are black, good for you to say just American. African_American is a silly term. It is obvious blacks have African heritage.  I am Caveman, African, French, English, American...what a mouthful.|`|4sK8MrDoaa	It was white people who first made the distinction between us and them.  So, you continue to call yourself whatever you want and so will the rest of us.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	It identifies themselves as descendants of Africans.  I am white and most of my ancestors were German and English.  While I don't identify myself as German American or English American my heritage is important to me.  It is, after all, my heritage & it makes me who I am today.      But now that I think about it, it seems redundant since aren't all blacks descendants of Africans?  It would be like saying "I'm a black black American."  So from now on I won't refer to black people as African Americans; I'll refer to them only as blacks.|`|548acf9a110e33867b881416ccb0256daa	The term African-American is a progression in the long line of descriptions of Black people. It is meant to be politically correct, but it is still an identifier(African-American=Black=colore... I personally do not consider myself an African or an American.

So if my ancestors were slave should we get something. Plus just like 20 years thing became equal for us.   Think about how unfair it still is whites had a 200 year head start. But we'er catching up Obama!    I feel you on that, no one will call me africa again, it time to stick up for myself and not a race that i know nothing about. I mean they only teach amercan history at my school.|`|9FI7zaKraa	I think Teddy Roosevelt said it best. We are all Americans. Period. Once you come here you should become part of America, speak english and be American.

Black is usually attributed to something bad i.e Black magic, Blackmail,Blacklisted and so on. In any case they are not black, that is a general term as white people are not white in colour. So African American is more appropriate as they originated from Africa.  I do not regard Obama as black rather light skinned.  So lets all stop referring to people as black white or yellow.  I feel it is very insulting|`|jYLZYxDvaa	Becuase they want to.|`|lFPsPzxzaa	that's a good question|`|RL3EVSW2aa	they just like messing with the white people|`|Z391sLTcaa	have wondered this myself, it seems to me the opposite of integrating!

I think we all want to know the answer to this one.|`|6FzqPzYPaa	We are all Black. National Geographic took DNA from every race and every country.   Nobody is different.Some are just less educated..|`|5mfVgz64aa	they will do anything to prove they are different, it also helps get them on welfare and get free hand outs  at tax payers expense.. they have the same chances everyone else does to make something of their lives but it is easier to get into a welfare program by saying the white man is keeping him down even though there are so many things the white man does to help them they will not put forth the effort to better themselves the way a white man does through hard work and proper schooling..that is why the black population still has a high rate of people going to jail and they still have the highest murder rate compared to other races.. you do not see a lot of white on white crime because the white people do not have to protect a street corner that makes them illegal money|`|XSptIZdsaa	I think most of the time these days it's guilt-ridden middle class non-black people who insist on saying 'african-american' because they're embarrassed about saying the word 'black' - they're worried about offending someone and are trying too hard to be 'politically correct'. Which is ridiculous because not every black person comes from Africa anyway. In the UK, people say 'afro-carribean' a lot instead.|`|rcGkwZZPaa	I mean i'm treated normal and im from Ukriaine im equal no one is bothering and people who think about rase is stupid everyone is the same inside :)
DIEih5asaa	Yes, only Gordon Brown was in it.|`|6b84153bfe2261ef2f364d1d441125dcaa	General elections in Great Britain refer to the election of Members of Parliament (MPs) to the House of Commons; these must be held within 5 years and 1 month of the last one, but are often held before that time as it is up to the parties in government when to call a general election. The current Labour Party government have held general elections every four years since coming to power in May 1997 and thereafter in June 2001 and May 2005. Therefore another election is not legally obliged to occur until June 2010|`|xXEFvl8Naa	there can be an election at any time interval, in normal circumstances this is up to a maximum of five years.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	We don't have a general election every four years.    The law says we have to have an election avery five years at the most. Politicians try to time the election to be at the point when they have the most support, but many don't want to leave it the full five years, hence we often have an election every four years. Also, the 2001 and 2005 elections were timed to coincide with local/european elections, to save time and money. It doesn't have to be every 4 years though.    I think it was the 1911 Parliament Act, which stated that elections must be held every 5 years. Under this law, we must have an election on or before 3rd May 2010.|`|3uGcqN2Eaa	Geneal Elections have to be held every 5 years, however, it is within the serving prime ministers gift to call an election at any time during his period of office.

nz8U5rNaaa	already happening here in Arizona with the Apache's mostly.    This war is fought in a court room      water rights and water access is the issue.|`|w9cicy0Daa	It's already been going on a while in the Middle East, particularly around the Israeli-Palestine area. Water really is a scarcity there. The water problems in the parts of the west will probably be more about polluted water and thus a lack of clean recources than about water scarcity.    regerugged - it's not about water being exhaustible (although I dispute the idea that clean water is always available) it's about fighting for access. Africa is a prime example of access being restricted through either natural or man-made means. And when you consider that some places sell it in bottles because the local water is either polluted or there are no sources, it's clear that it is a problem.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Already happening in the middle east between Israel and its neighbors and to a lesser extent in southwest asia as well as North America (Great Lakes consortium using politics to prevent water from being pumped out of their lakes)|`|AA11424005	We won't.

Why do you people keep running around wringing your hands an worrying about the latest "crisis"?      Relax, have a couple of cold ones and enjoy life for a change.  Not every issue is a problem.

Want to sit on your **** all day, get a wide screen TV, 2 cars and no taxes to pay, plus 20k a year? Say you're disabled!  3) They ruined the economy with their spending. When times were good, they spent spent spent. Now look - Brown thinks he can spend his way out of the credit crunch. We're going to be 1 trillion pounds in debt by 2015. And who has to pay for it? The poor kids that are being born now (each one owes the government 17,000). When the debt is stabilised, by 2030, I'll be 38. I'll have been working for 15 years, paying back all the money because he spent it when I was 10.  4) High taxes, which are spent on the benefit thieves and immigrants.    So, yeah, as you basically concluded - there's no reason to vote Labour!|`|qVM9OUtOaa	dont!!|`|KuWLNfYbaa	I will vote labour because there is no alternative and also because today's problems were caused by Thatchers government whereby the economic structure of Britain was changed for the worse as we can now see.Both Conservative and Liberal lack charismatic characters with the exception of Boris Johnson.They are all ineffectual idiots and there is very little difference between each party, but at least labour has some interesting idiots.We are lucky here we can vote Plaid Cymru|`|LIpCGz4oaa	no. definitely not. and how can anyone say the conservatives are as bad as labour? when conservatives were in last time, we had a very strong economy.  everything was fine. now look at the state this country is in. apart from the things you mentioned, we still have hospitals with mixed wards. supposed to have been stopped by labour  but no its still as bad.. we still have elderly people treated worse than  factory farmed chickens.  the crime  is  getting worse and police are reducing the number of officers because of costs. how can things get worse with conservatives? we're at rock bottom now.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	1.

I think we should have a major overhaul of British politics and remove all present politicians and party's and start again. We deserve the best politicians in the world to run our country so why not buy the best and be the best,it works within our national sport so why not in politics.|`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	No, not really, unless you are a benefits scrounger, not a genuine benefits claimant, who as a scrounger enjoys sitting on your backside watching people who work hard for their income having to pay extortionate rates of taxation just for your idle pleasure.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	I dont vote because of cases such as Mr Hain and his little "MISTAKE".  But i am becoming attracted to the Lib Dems because of Vince Cable and his direct approach on the "credit crunch" isssues. Also their leader spoke well on the "Lords on the fiddle" (allegedly?) he said they all should be booted out of the Lords, i totally agree. Its time the whole lot of them were sorted out. There is one rule for them and another rule for the rest of us. Most of them work as solicitors or barristers as well as being MPs they see it as a career thing and not as a vocation to serve the people.  We need more like Tony Benn a man of principle and integrity.   Of course not all MPs are corrupt but evil thrives when good people stand by and do nothing.|`|AA12349988	The problem croxx is that the Tories are not offering much difference - both the main parties are fighting in the middle ground and offering no alternative.

Adult literacy cannot be blamed on the Labour party, that would be the Conservative's fault! Th economic  gloom is world wide though GB position in the world is making us come out worse for it.

That begs the question what about the Lib-Dems, well I honestly don't know what to tell you.  The BNP and all these rest, well only if your desperate and totally plssed-off, which some people are.    Usually in a general election you choose and vote for the party that you think is best for yourself and your family this time around though it looks like you have to choose between the lesser of the two evils.    For me who has always voted Labour cannot really give you any good reason to vote Labour, not even the threat of a Tory government is a good enough reason, as Labour are totally useless and out of touch with reality and the people, especially with the working class of Britain.    Every which way you turn there is either bad news or some fool from Labour telling us that things are not as bad as they seem, or they have up their sleeve some new crazy pet scheme and idea that they want to in-flick upon the rest of us.|`|HyulW3aiaa	Frighten the ***ts and vote BNP.|`|c5ca3ca881510b113bbfaa1ef922d149aa	No|`|fNWoRd2Haa	Simple answer- No|`|FmucfdCEaa	Higher minimum wage and cigarette restrictions.

wz9szz3Gaa	I don't normally listen to Rush but ever since Rush has become a thorn in Obama's side I can't resist. I agree with decreasing the big business tax and capital gains this would bring back some business to the States and more jobs and people will start to invest. The problem with this is democrats don't listen they like to spend and spend which will cause hyperinflation after the recession. The democrats should  be bipartisan and listen to both sides and I believe Republicans agree with Rush on this one but the problem lies on Obama and this Messiah like attitude that democrats have given him. I believe Obama will do himself in by this stimulus plan and as usual the people will be looking towards the republicans for help by 2012 in a way I hope Obama fails!|`|AA11648899	I've been listening to RUSH and SEAN for years and years now.

I have been listening to him and others over 10 years. I don't believe his plan makes sense. For one thing, it gives democrats half of what they want. That's always bad. For another thing, he assumes democrats "want" to fix the economy. I believe nothing could be further from the truth. I believe the President Urkel and the porkie pigs  "top democrats" know exactly what will happen when their "stimulus" package goes into force. I believe they know they are destroying the economy. I believe they want it so bad they can taste it. The reason? To create people who need government help. The more poor people they create, the more power they will have as more and more people vote to tax the rich. Obama, as the head of the party of the poor, will become the de facto master of the Republicans who will serve under him as tax slaves with no government representation, as soon as more than 51% pay no taxes or get handouts from the government. It may have already happened|`|396466c466e50f080eb0a95874e54b0caa	Yeah, I have listened to Rush Limpbaugh.    Anybody that thinks it is reasonable to hand over $414 billion taxpayer dollars to the habitual liar and known drug addict Rush Limpbaugh, to do as he see fit, needs to be hauled away and locked up under provisions of the PATRIOT Act to protect society from ignorance of that magnitude.|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	I do not watch nor listen to Rush but I know he has this country's future at heart.  This stimulus package is going to be the ruination of life as we have been.  Rush has proposed a good idea but I am sure the arrogant Obama will not consider it.  It is such a same that the unknowing American people do not see the failure of the plan.    p.s. I do not have the time to watch him.|`|BEe6jwNXaa	I listened to Rush a long time ago and wonder how I ever did.  But if he believes this would show you anything he is more ignorant than I thought.  If things improve how exactly will you be able to contribute improvement to spending or tax cuts with complete certainty?  Will the tax cut money get one marking on it that so we can follow where it goes and the spending money gets a different mark?  Will someone keep track of how many times tax cut dollars exchanges hands versus spending dollars?  Is someone going to watch all tax cut dollars be spent, becoming new income and spent again and comepare that to all spending dollars becoming income and spent again becoming more income, add them up and see which is greater?  That's what would really need to be done to prove that trickle down economics really works and doesn't only result in the spreading of the income gap.  We'd need to track the money the wealthy are saving from tax breaks, be sure it goes to creating jobs and not just increases their net worth, and watch it get aaalllll the waaaaay dooooown to the little guy.    If there is always an optimal choice versus spending and tax cuts for every economic situation (which there isn't) then the only way we can figure things out is using a controlled situation.  We need to have two recessions under the exact same conditions, one having only spending for a stimulus and the other only tax cuts.  Then we compare the results.  Unfortunately the only way to get identical recessions is to have parallel universes and have one be the tax cut universe and the other be the spending universe.  Let me know how that works.    But in all seriousness I will agree with him on one thing, the stimulus package does need tax cuts and cannot be solely from spending.  And I'm all for the corporate tax cut to entice more job growth.  But at some point taxes must go up to take care of the deficit, lest we want to cut funding for road repairs, the military and other public goods that private industry won't deal with.  And the best way to do that is to raise income taxes of those that have money to spare and are just accumulating it.|`|RvShEWESaa	Rush Limbaugh is a former drug user, and a racist.  He publicly states that he wants Barack Obama to fail....  Now I don't think it's racist to disagree with the president,  But what other reason, than racism would you have for wanting the president to fail.  HE wants the nations to fall apart!?    That psycho path is going to attack that administration as long as it is around.    Just yesterday, the Obama administration said that they are going over the stimulus package, line for line. Taking out what they don't want.    It is not even finished!  So what the hell is Rush bitching about.  He does not even know what the final stimulus package will be!?|`|B42PBRk6aa	He's one of the few that make sense.

Fist of All if he were a true racist, he would never let Thomas Sowell guest host his show. Some of his ideas are satrical in nature, but the premise is serious. I am like Rush waiting for Obama to fail, it is right around the corner, he will just blame it on bush.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	Unfortunately--liberals cannot stand to listen to both points of view--they are just incapable of knowing the facts or being in reality--and Rush reminds them of how unwilling they are to have an educated mind...sad but true.    ." Shakespeare said it best:  Ignorance is Bliss..'Ti's Folly to be wise.."     And Franklin too: " A Man convinced against HIS will is of the same opinion still."|`|AA11424005	I listen to Rush almost every day.  He is a talk show host and entertainer.  He is not an accomplished economist.  His plan is satirical in nature.  Being a true conservative, he is not serious about a trillion dollar stimulus, no matter how it is divided.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	If Mr. Limbaugh thinks he has a solution to solving our problems I applaud his efforts but I think he could achieve more by stepping up to the plate and running for office himself.  It's easy to sit back and find fault.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Yes I have, listened to him, just enough to know he is a head job.  And no, it is not a good idea to listen to him.  The fact that you  find anything he says as remarkably sensible shows two things, you do realize anything he says that sounds sensible is remarkable, and that you have listened to him too long already.  Sorry for your loss.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	I listen to both right and left talk radio.  Rush raises some good points however the majority of what he says is intended for shock value and ratings.  He is the mouth piece for the GOP, nothing more.  He repeats party lines without regards to reality.

But in india political party has also a constitution and laws whose cant be cross by any discipline party worker or member. As you respect you country, your father-mother as like you have to manner to respect you work and his laws.     When common men join a political party or politics, then he knows every thing about his party. Because his party constitution has been made before his joining the party. You better know about his policy and ethics, also his rule and regulation. When you left some political party in India have so many parties they have rule by democratically. They have a legal constitution and general party election held regularly.     I could not say you have not a responsible for you country, but you have also responsible for you party. Because your party has been represented by yourself. If you are not agree with your party stand, you should try to give your opinion on that matter interlay dont go behind the party laws.     Political party knows his candidate has loosing his manner. Therefore the have issue whip, because his candidate doesnt go behind party and party policy. Candidate have option when he has felling, the policy or motion in parliament is better for country then he should resign his constituency seat and also resign from his party. Most of time member has his own interest they have not interest with country. If in the next coming election party will have not giving ticket to him, or they know his performance has not good and his reputation between local mass has bad that time they will go behind the party and getting his interest.     Party whip is not a current rule and regulations, when you feel you are going for country interest or his self-interest you can vote that time, afterward party should taking initiative against you and punish to you. So whip is a statement that means party has taking that step on that issue, not a vote of his candidate that has been given by his party. Our constitution has told, the Member of Parliament has cast his vote without any fear and greed. Parliament has insured to his member and give protection if any fear to Member of Parliament.    So whip is systematic way of political party, not a law of Indian constitution. Indian constitution has only provided discipline to members and party. If political party complain to speaker against member then speaker provide rule and regulation and disqualify the candidate.    In the somnath case there has been politics, when somnath dada going behind the party then the have option to resign from Member of Parliament after saving his country. Also when party expelled him to party membership then party also go to higher authority and complain against him. Party brings mahaviyog himself. But no one has taken any further step after expelled him to party. So all the matter on this case has been politically to give the people of India we are apposing nuclear bill and inner circle they will with the UPA alliance. Recent news have coming from communist party, somnath dada and his party going with a good settlement. Next few days or month we will definitely lesion somnath dada a full flow working member of CPM party.
AA10709853	None with that attitude.   For one the benefits are the same across all five Branches and ALL five Branches have the possibility of danger, regardless of  community.    As for choice of duty station: you go where you are sent, not necessarily where you want to go.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	Best way to find out what you want to know is ask a recruiter what bases are in Japan (no idea for the USA sorry) and then find out what roles they have open, or what positions they're lacking service men/women for. That being said, you shouldn't go into the military just for the sake of going into the military. If you don't LOVE the job that you're signing up for the next few years for and you're only taking it because that's what they needed at the time you might regret it very quickly and I hear you get jail time for going AWOL in the US services lol.|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	Rofl. Thanks for wanting to "serve."    ...Not..
AA10709853	you might have to convince a Navy recruiter that you won't pull the same stunt twice, and it may take a bit before you find one willing to take a chance on you, but technically  unless the AF has not yet officially released you from DEP( and they can hold you in DEP for a year before cutting the paperwork) then you have no legal hurdles to trying to enlist in the Navy.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	Yes indeed you can join any service you want too. Until you take that final oath at MEPS you have every right to change your mind and do what is best for you. Being on DEP is a joke your not getting paid for it the time doesn't count as you being in anymore so do what you wish and good luck your making a good choice to serve when the economy isn't very well.|`|YjOjWU0Jaa	Yep, you have nothing stopping you from joining the Navy.  The only restriction you are under is the fact that the Air Force recruiters you blew off would probably rather piss on your face than let you sign with them again.  Other than the ill feelings, you are totally in the clear.|`|8Py5ashTaa	You will be good to go, but will need a DEP discharge waiver.  When the time comes and you are at MEPS again, you will talk on the phone with the XO of that command.  The XO will test your commitment and integrity with questions like, "Why should I let you join my Navy only to have you drop out of our DEP?"  This is standard and it is nothing personal.  But they will expect you to be totally committed to the Navy.  Since becoming a recruiter I personally have enlisted 4 USAF DEP drop outs, so yes it is possible.  Best of luck
YOGgHoNdaa	The reason things are copywrited is to protect the owner - plain and simple.  Say you didn't have a lawn mower and wanted to mow your lawn, and just walked over to your neighbor's shed and used his lawn mower without asking . . . .Would you consider that right?? Of course not.  You need to ask permission.  People who are musicians copywrite their music as their own. This is how they make a living. If you want to use their stuff you must ask permission - again plain and simple.  Copying it in any way shape or form without permission is illegal.  Announcing who the creator is before or after you play it is pretty much just telling the world you stole someone's work.  You can either purchase the music from the on-line music company, or go directly to the publisher.  It will undoubtedly cost $ - usually not that much, but it does.  Please do the right thing . . .
Kh4p4gPXaa	As the one above me said,  the only time you have to ID yourself is when you place someone under arrest.

Otherwise, what's the point of being undercover.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	No, under cover officers, detectives, investigators and the police in general can lie to you. Legally, it is not entrapment. What you see on tv and what goes on in the real world are two different things, trust me.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Nope, but it's really to our advantage that so many people actually think so.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Police are allowed to lie. they do not have to tell you that they are police if you ask.  if they had to tell everyone they were police then they would never arrest anyone.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	They rarely ever do anything in real life like they do on t.v.  Seriously.  More than half the stuff you see on Law and Order is the "Hollywood version" of the law.    And the answer to your question:  it's not true.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	No.  Common urban myth.      It is only entrapment if the Officer encourages you to do something you would not normally do.  By denying he/she is a Police Officer they are not leading you to commit a criminal act.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Since you believe everything that is on TV, I've got some real estate that you would love to buy.    I only have to identify myself when I put you under arrest.

u6ALw1gAaa	Depending on the dates of the reports, the indictment, etc. it is perfectly valid.  You are facing a serious charge and need to talk to a lawyer.|`|17717e2a2a7d4173feec132f9df09e88aa	some states have years to file and what sucks is you could have a warrant and not even know it.    best get this cleared up.
u6ALw1gAaa	If an arrest is made based on probable cause then it is a valid arrest.  In your question you have a written report where the "victim" told the Police you committed some sort of fraud.  If the Police arrest you based on this information then the arrest is not false.  Your beef is with the person that filed the report if the report is false, not with the Police.    An example of a false arrest would be if an Officer arrested you for DWI but knew you had not had a drop to drink and knew you were not on any drugs.|`|WrDGhduxaa	the police make a false arrest when they know you were not guilty of an offense or made up an offense.  Since someone filed charges against you the police had no other choice.   The D.A. or court will decide  your guilt, your complaint is against the person who filed the charges with the police.  If you can prove they lied for gain, then you have a case against them.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	You're asking for legal advice that I and the majority of people on YA cannot give you since that would be practicing law without a license in your area.  There's no reason for anyone here to get into trouble (yes it is illegal to do that) because you have yourself in a scrape.  You need to contact a defense attorney who will advise you of the rights you have in this particular case.    EDIT:  the answer below me is the reason you shouldn't ask for legal advice on YA.      Why don't we do this?    Because the person who is giving advice might not be an attorney who has a license to practice law in your area.    Laws vary from state to state.  What someone tells you on here may not apply to the laws in the state you live in.    Lawyers aren't going to throw legalese such as "prima facie" at you.  Do you know what prima facie is?  Probably not.    Please, contact a defense attorney and don't take any advice from here.|`|50zbKv0jaa	the arrest was fair and was not false arrest  it is for the courts to determine your guilt, not the police. the police have established a prima facie case against you

An Emperor often puts his siblings to death so they don't gain power.|`|cO6BD3hVaa	Horrible Question.  If Obama's mother was to have an abortion I don't think anyone would care, because nobody would know who Obama was.  Opinion:  Abortion really is for the best, theres too many cases in which the mother could die, rape, incest, and bad parents to where we can't make abortions illegal.  We need it for the sake of our country and the world to keep from becoming even MORE overpopulated.  Edit:  You're ignorance towards the issue is horrible and makes me want to punch a baby in the throat.|`|vDLnslBFaa	It only means that Hillary would be president now and you would be asking the same question about her.

Perhaps she did.    That is absolutely none of your business.     If you want to get rid of people by wishing they had never been born you should read "Making History" by Stephen Fry    Also any pregnancy that doesn't come to full term is called an abortion, so you have spontaneous ones aka miscarriages and abortions after medical intervention.     You are making mindless comments in a sensitive area pal. Go away and grow up a bit.
AA11163314	Not at all.    The company that was facing hard times was Brown and Root.  This was a company that specialized in providing support services to the US military.  They were facing serious financial difficulties so the US military encouraged Haliburton to buy them out in order to prevent the disruption that would be caused if Brown and Root went bankrupt.|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	I really doubt it, but I can assure you that's one of reason's, besides Bush's other lies, to go to war with Iraq. I believe Haliburton, Cheney's company got most of the contracts to rebuild Iraq once Bush destroyed it and smiled happily while he was stuffing the blood money into his pockets.
AA11163314	When I read that news article I was amazed at the stupidity of this move.    The kicked Blackwater out because a bunch of clueless idiots didn't like them.    Anybody notice how the scandal about the supposed 'massacre' committed by Blackwater suddenly disappeared from the news once the Blackwater people were allowed to tell their side of the story (and provided evidence to back it up)?    Funny how you only hear about the accusations against them - but never hear about it when those accusations were shown to be false.    The _really_ sad thing about all of this is how many people are going to die because of this.  Blackwater has a perfect record in that nobody under their protection has been killed or kidnapped in Iraq.  How long until we start to hear about US diplomatic staff getting killed or kidnapped in Iraq now?|`|SkWzsnuxaa	KHAAAAAANNN! Sorry, it had to be done.    BW is not banned from Iraq. If they were banned we would just hire another company who would likely hire the same agents because 99% of them are reliable. They should not be judged based on the 1%!|`|UXOegnWvaa	They aren't banned, and even if they were the U.S. State Department has agents known as the Diplomatic Security Service who provide security for diplomats, much like the Secret Service does for the president.  In addition to DSS, every U.S. embassy has a Marine Corps detachment, and while their wearing of dress uniforms are ceremonial, their training definitely isn't.|`|8vCzgOlpaa	It's about time they kicked Blackwater out most are nothing but ex-military turned mercenary that should be wearing the uniform of a US soldier or marine making chicken feed money than doing a higher paying mercenary job instead of doing right fighting along side their friends. And now that they are out what will many do re-enlist? I bet many will unless Blackwater does get some contracts for the piracy stuff going on but they have gotten a bad name the last 5 years or so. But now that they have been banned you can surely bet that the Iraqi government has indeed implemented something about not letting any type of private security firms to work in country and the State Department will probably now have to send a list to the Iraqi government for approval of anyone they want to bring in for DSS work. So there won't be any job openings  As for the diplomats they still have those DSS personnel but you will see more of that job be held by the USMC for protection.

AA11206283	Probably your Grandfather would have to waive his rights to it before anyone else could make a claim; and he legally may have to claim it    Talk to a probate lawyer|`|AA11752525	The individual claiming from the State has the initial obligation to demonstrate that s/he is the closest rightful heir. Unless the closest relative makes this claim based upon a will or intestate succession, the state will claim this money and it will be delivered to the general state fund.         The State favors keeping money and you would need commit perjury to keep them from finding out that your grandfather and closest natural heir  is alive. Not a good risk given the possibility of the truth being made known and the liar exposed to criminal liability.        I further might guess that your grandfather has an agreement with the nursing home for lifetime support in exchange for his present and future assets. If you desire to see them living up to  their obligation to provide a life time bed, meals and an overhead roof, you should have no  resentment for allowing the nursing home entitlement to this money following his obligation to pay..        I have seen and been asked to collect money from State Treasuries. Too often all that is involved is a sub-$100 banking account, utility deposit or undelivered nominal tax refund.        When you find out the amount, your ardor for this money will presumably cool. If, wrong, and your grandfather is sitting on "big money" you should involve an attorney or accountant into negotiating and resolving this with the nursing home neither identifying the amount or the patient.        Good Luck.|`|AA11696297	without a will, it goes to her next of kin.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	With your grandfather in the nursing home, what usually happens is, if your grandmother died, all properties belong to your grandfather, that's if that's what her will said.

NOW! when HE dies, I hope HE has a will made out for what is left over, the State should make sure whoever is named the benificiary of the will, which would be your father! What I would do, is go talk to Grandpa and find out what he has planned when he dies, then go talk to the State Treasurers and find out what THEY plan to do with the property or money still flotting around after everything has been paid!|`|lNsPQtUnaa	There isnt really anything such as *unclamed proprety*. This is because before everyone dies, they write a ''will''. Will is a important document that tells who owns the dead mans property and thier money and who takes care of theit children.    For example of someones parents die and child lives in England. If will says grandma takes care of child,if she agree and if on will it says they have to live in England, gramma has to move to England and live with child.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	Interesting question. Most people don't know the answer. The constitution empowers the government and sets rules for operation. The Bill of rights guarantees NO rights to individual citizens. Those rights are assumed to be God given. The Bill of Rights limits the government from taking your God given rights away.     Bill of Rights   Amendment I  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.       Amendment II  A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.       Amendment III  No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.       Amendment IV  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.       Amendment V  No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia, when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.       Amendment VI  In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.       Amendment VII  In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise reexamined in any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.       Amendment VIII  Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.       Amendment IX  The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.       Amendment X  The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.|`|6f89b5d16dbdb895634e3f8c49efb428aa	The bill of rights is the first ten amendments to the constitution. So actually they are the same thing. Rights include freedom of religion, freedom of speech, right to keep and bear arms. right of free assembly. right to be free from unreasonable search and siezure, right of security in one's person etc. Just google Bill of Rights for a compleat list.|`|AA10015960	Though there are twenty-seven amendments in the United States Constitution the first ten that were ratified in 1791 are known today as the Bill of Rights. These first ten amendments represent the foun  dation upon which all other amendments were built upon. The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791 with the intention to stop the federal government from infringing on the affairs and individual freedoms of United State citizens. Without any of these rights the government today would have more power over individuals then the original settlers originally intended when drafting the United States Constitution.    Amendment 1    Freedom of Speech and Assembly- In the first of the ten amendments this amendment promises that United States Citizens have the freedom of speech which includes gestures, freedom in the press, and other forms of expression. The first amendment also allows citizens to peacefully congregate and assemble to petition the government for grievances or any problems that they would like to have resolved.    Amendment 2    Right to keep and bear arms- The second amendment gives citizens the right to own have guns in their possession. This amendment was created so that if the government at any point became to powerful and the citizens wanted to destroy it and create a new government they would have the power and the means to do so.    Amendment 3    Protection from quartering of troops- This amendment makes it illegal for soldiers to take up stay in the household of citizens. Though it may seem useless in today's society, it was created because back when the English ruled over the colonies many times the soldiers that were sent over seas from Great Britain would invade the households of those colonists using their houses as a place to live.    Amendment 4    Protection from unreasonable search and seizure- The fourth amendment gives citizens the right to privacy. This amendment makes it illegal for government officials to search and seize any property such as houses, anything on a person, papers, and affects without proper cause, which has been okayed and affirmed by a judge.    Amendment 5    The right to due process, double jeopardy, self-incrimination, and eminent domain-    -Due Process- Gives citizens the right to have a fair and speedy trial in the court of law before any of their freedoms can be taken away from them.    -Double Jeopardy- No citizen can be tried in court for the same crime twice. This law was created so that the government could not repeatedly prosecute you over and over again until you were found guilty.    -Self-Incrimination- "I plead the fifth." If you have ever watched an episode of Law and Order on TV I am positive you have heard that quote before. When someone says they plead the fifth it is referring to this amendment, which states that, a person does not have to testify against ones self in the court of law. No one but yourself can force you to testify in front of a judge or jury.    Eminent Domain- This law in the amendment allows the government to take your personal property but if it is done it must be compensated for at a fair market value. Though a police officer may commandeer your car, he must then pay for the fair market value of that car.    Amendment 6    The right to a trial by jury- The sixth amendment gives citizens the right to a trial by an impartial jury of their peers and a speedy trial. This amendment also gives citizens the right to have an attorney even if the defendant cannot afford one (An attorney will be paid for and appointed to a defendant if the defendant cannot afford one) and has the right to be prosecuted in the district where the crime has been committed.    Amendment 7    Civil trial by jury- If a lawsuit in a court case exceeds twenty dollars you have the right to have a trial by jury. Though this amendment allows for you to have a trial by jury you must first request it from the judge before it is granted to you.    Amendment 8    Prohibition of excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment- This amendment makes it illegal for judges to set bail at excessively high amounts and it makes it illegal for courts and officials of the law to treat or condemn you to cruel and unusual punishment.    Amendment 9    Protection of rights not specifically written in the Bill of Rights- This amendment protects citizens by stating that anything that is not stated in the constitution cannot deny or undervalue certain rights that are retained by the people of the United States.    Amendment 10    The powers of the states and the people- In this amendment it gives the states any powers that were left out of the constitution, and any powers that were left out of the constitution or state laws to the people of the United States.

iBQ0LF4Daa	1. Limbaugh is an entertainer, which means he finds his niche in a competitive market place and exploits it for every penny he can.  People advertise with him because he makes money.  He is making loads of money off of expressing views that many people implicitly hold by making them explicit.  For many, what he says is not new, but what they have been waiting for.  Poison?  No simply a money-grubbing fiend like any other public personality.  His analysis is typically banal, he is not interested in political analysis, but instead psychology on a sociological level.      2. Limbaugh thrives because people listen.  He is a mirror and a conduit of people who listen to him.  They see what they believe, or want to believe but could not articulate, and he takes up the most radical side of their views and expresses it to the larger public.  He would not exist (qua person he is) if it was not for the people that tuned into him every day.      3. Entertainment- He helps the left thrive by defining one of the bounds of Right Conservative Discourse and focusing that group into a few authority figures.  He acts as a radical representation of what they are not, much like Bush did.  He therefore becomes a human-totem of modern society.  Some call this polarization, but it actually affirms the values of our social framework of democracy.  He represents (along with the Evangelicals) the right bound, of which not many would be likely to follow any further (right now), the limit of what the group on top of the bell curve and to the right would be willing to go. The left has its figures that bound it as well, but this is a question of the right.    4. Limbaugh is not a radical.  He can't be while maintaining his popularity.  He is a congealed-human support of the status quo of the right.  He is not a person when we see/hear/read him.  He is his text.  Whatever he may be in life, he will remain a text to us, and this text is a conduit and mirror to numerous Americans.|`|jZZ6KZVxaa	Rush is the King of radio,,,,(Obama's words).  ..........

I choose not to listen to him but it is his right to speak his mind.  This conversation wasn't taking place when people were talking (and still are) about George W. Bush and his day as president.  Freedom of speech is protected in the Constitution.|`|AA11323988	HE has strong opinions but he does not promote hate. Just because he does not agree with the left it does not mean he is full of hate. I am no big Limbaugh fan but he has a right to his opinion and he has the right to express his opinions. I find it a little disturbing that there are those in our government who wish to silence people like him.     For the last 8 years I have heard people that hated GW say it is not unpatriotic to say things against Bush, a point that I mostly agree with, so why is there now such a reversal in philosophy?|`|Wb27b3onaa	No. He's actually smart and could be a great help to the democrats if they would listen to him and follow his advice.|`|0me6vDF3aa	Typical "Obamabot!"    Rush Limbaugh does not promote hate!  You don't know what you are talking about.   Listen to his program for a week or two yourself and and then make up your mind!   People who say he promotes hate have never listened to the show!    Why do people advertise with him - it is because he brings in the money for advertisers!   When liberal talk shows go on the air the DNC and rich liberals have to send in money to keep the shows afloat!  Rush makes a lot of money for his advertisers!    When you write that you "used to listen to him" I don't believe you!   Even fair minded liberals know he doesn't promote hate.   Yes, he has a different point of view on politics that is contrary to what you get from liberal news promoters on CNN, ABC, CBS and NBC - but that is what free speech is for!    Never forget over 47% of Americans did not vote for Obama, we have opinions too!    When you take away all of the fraudulent votes that ACORN and other liberal hate groups managed to use to swing the election we probably have even more than the 47%!|`|OlcC4hwcaa	do what cons do, get in touch with his advertisers and tell them you will not use their products because of rush|`|yvPA8FSsaa	He never promotes hate.  What you are saying is untrue.  I know.  I have been listening to his show for 20 years.  He speaks for and to Conservatives.  Conservatives may be many things but we are not sheep.    When was the last time you saw a massive protest rally filled with people who were Conservative?  No, the followers are on the Left.  Those of us on the Right are self-reliant, thinkers not driven by emotion.      *|`|c1kKXiboaa	I listen to Limbaugh on a fairly regular basis. Rush is got to be where he's at by being informative and entertaining. I don't always agree with his point of view (I'm a Libertarian) and he does make mistakes, I but have NEVER heard him promote so-called "hate speech."  If you want to hear that try listening to the liberal radio station Air America. Yeah, Al Franken, Randi Rhodes, et. al., are the epitome of tolerance. Go drink your kool-aid and let the adults talk.|`|DBIKou8faa	No, he's quite brilliant.  Have you noticed the number of posts about him since Obama took office?  Like him or not, he is at his best at times like this. I guess many people didn't listen to him before BO took office, or maybe it just didn't bother them when he criticized Bush (which he did).  He's laughing all the way to the bank.    People take him far too seriously - and you would realize that he doesn't even take himself all that seriously if you listened to him.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	He doesn't promote hate...he tells it like it is..people hate...and we know which ones too...he is the voice of free speech--get used to it--there are 40 MILLION of us who are against mr. obama and his plans!    Thank you Rush for saying what needs to be said!    1st Amendment Rights!!!!!!!!!!|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Please post an example of him promoting hate.  Saying that he doesn't want Obama's policy to succeed is not hateful.  I challenge you to show me just ONE example of him promoting hate...|`|0nZHAaQDaa	Rush is the man, he speaks of sound mind not the Madness of the run away stimulus packages that our great grandchildren will still be making payments upon.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	He is poison to democracy.  Let me give you a quote and see what you think of it when you apply it to Rush.    "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the [public] is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.''   Edward Bernays. Founder of the modern PR industry.  He held the belief that democracy was only for the ultra rich few while every one else were just animals to be manipulated.    Rush is well paid to propagate the propaganda of those who pay him and look at the result.  Millions of people tune in every day and are essentially brainwashed into thinking things that actually are against their own best interests.  The double nephew of Sigmund Freud knoew what he was talking about.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	The ignorant and uneducated love to listen to Limbaugh who deviously and manipulatively plays on their ill informed insecurities ... like HEAT who says Limbaugh tells the truth about killing 'preborn' babies whatever they may be, or that Limbaugh tells the truth about taxpayers being 'forced' to pay for abortions in Africa.   Anyone who researches the sources of these purported 'truths' and uses their own common sense soon realizes that what Limbaugh says is not true, not even half true.     Yes, you are quite correct ... Limbaugh's agenda is to promote hate and disharmony while unashamedly bleating that he is a Christian. Jesus, the god of love, would be horrified at what Limbaugh is espousing in his name!|`|2c3rcQRbaa	To Liberals he is.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	He is a joke. He has no credibility, he just says what the nuts want to hear.|`|BquqToGaaa	Ignore him, and he'll go away.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	First and foremost Limbaugh is an entertainer and a promoter of his radio show.  Controversy gains coverage, coverage adds advertising dollars.  For Limbaugh it is, and has always been, about money.  Limbaugh is playing the media.  He is a paid for political hack.
diWKJGUvaa	Notice the hostility in many of the Conservative answers?, need I say more?|`|VVCpJFxtaa	You again. You asked this question already and I will ask the same. Can you provide an example?    Just as I thought you cannot provide one legitimate example of where conservative men disrespect women. I suspect, that like a lot of liberals, you are speaking out of your a** and have know idea what you are talking about.    You use NOW as your proof. Yeah, no bias against conservative  men there.    Yes Vermin we tend to get upset when ignorant people slander us and offer no real evidence to back up their idiotic statements.|`|TvD9BIGRaa	Never seen it?|`|nz8U5rNaaa	What article. I see nothing there but the NOW website. Not proof where is the study, where is the statistics?    This is just a generalization.|`|I4e8Hn3zaa	Just like Bill Clinton.   Treat them nice, USE them, and then cut them loose.|`|EEqEXDeUaa	If by "better" you mean "letting them dress like whores and making them work outside the home" then maybe your right!!!!    /scarcasm|`|nwHaxG6Oaa	Because liberal men and liberal women are out having liberal sex with other people thus limiting the amount of stress which may lead to anger.    Perhaps you should rephrase your question to add the word "some" in front of  the word "liberal" and "conservative"  Your question gives the impression that all liberal and all conservatives treat women accordingly. Typical liberal propaganda I suppose.|`|DBIKou8faa	That's just plain silly.|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	You mean like Ted Kennedy?|`|BquqToGaaa	Conservative overcompensate for their lack of girth by slapping their women around.|`|u23sBafTaa	I disagree with that, i'm a conservative woman I know lots of conservative men.  I've never been treated badly !|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Good question.    Because Liberal Women are big, masculine, and hairy.    Liberal Men are feminine and afraid of their wives.    Neither Liberal Men or Liberal Women will ever work for a living.  We taxpayers support them both.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	Cons have cavemen mentalities, liberal men don't.  "Git me a beer woman, or I'll beat ya blue!"  Kind of like that.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	Empathy is a common thread among liberals.|`|nrnVqh7iaa	Because liberal men are almost women themselves.|`|57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	My wife and I are conservatives and have been happily married for 17 years.    ...and you?|`|AA11409272	Subjective, and I'm sure not accurate.     -conservative|`|MntRFqtHaa	Really?  Think about it.       Most conservatives are pro life.   That means that each life of each child is value.      Most liberasl are pro death.  45,000,000 children have been butchered.  The simple truth of the matter is 60% of all births are girls.    That means over 29,000.000 girls have been slaughtered.    Now who is treating women the worse?|`|fbeba5dc300a1f4a43941be04a82654aaa	I desagree, if you take a pole I bet you would find liberal men cheat on thier wives moe then conservative men do.  Conservative men have a higher percentage of regular religious services, who then have a higher level of moral behavior. PS NOW is an extremely liberal organizaton and therefore their opinions are invalid|`|j1A24TFeaa	Republicans usually preach religion, self righteousness and tolerance and behind peoples backs they are usually the offenders of conjugal violence and usually the men like to put their women in their "place" McCain has been known to call his wife some very unsavory names and has cheated on his handicapped wife. Many many republican men are old and have old fashioned values that benefit themselves and not the women in their space.    79vette...religious men usually are the worst cheats. Look at that preacher that just had a "gay" relationship. I bet he is a conversative republican.    My boyfriend is liberal, educated and treats me with total respect. He does not need to "dominate" me. Domination is for dog training not for relationships my friend.|`|9FI7zaKraa	this is BS, You neglect to specify what type of conservative. Most fiscal conservatives treast women better thasn fiscal liberals bu a margin of 9-1. Those who tend to lean towards socialistic and communistic thinking are more apt to abuse women. These facts are just as sound as those you present.|`|Wb27b3onaa	They don't. They tend to take advantage of women.|`|cXj0RqExaa	Because they believe in EQUALITY. :) Conservative men treat women like dogs because they believe they're in control and the women are their slaves. Liberal men are more educated anyways. ;)|`|Ry61ViNZaa	Uh?  No.    Do you really understand what NOW is about? And show me some kind of proof that lib men are better to women than anyone else?    This makes no sense at all.  You will really have to come up with some kind of facts.|`|5d0c834af3611cf4b3e3e733dbc37f0caa	Liberal men are women in men's clothing.|`|4bedkpvLaa	That is such crap your just being byass. In fact I can almost guaruntee its the other way around because less conservative people do drugs and alcohal and have permiscuous sex. SO WRONG YOUR WRONG YOU IDIOT!!!!! burn in hell ahhhh!!!!|`|OlcC4hwcaa	manners|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	what does that site have to do with how men treat women? please prove how liberals treat women better?  all the conservatives i know treat women very well|`|hirZcanfaa	Because conservative men only think about themselves. When it comes to conservatives now, it's all about me..me..and me!!    P.S. Oh...and me!!    Thumbs down on all neo-cons!!!!!    Looks like the conservative wives responding on here know their place in the home...barefoot, pregnant and cleaning the house!!!  "See Below"  Now get off yahoo and go cook something for your strong men...LOL|`|RtHq6y78aa	They don't.  I've been very happily married to a Conservative man for 26 years and my sons are Conservative and they are and will be great husbands!  My daughter only dates Conservatives because they are so awesome.    I'm thinking that liberal men are so sissified that their women can push them around and that makes some women happy.  To each his own.  I want a STRONG husband and father to my kids.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	The biased organization NOW is your source?!  That says it all.    If by being treated "better" you mean having a man kowtow to your every whim whilst you brow beat him than yeah I can see where you're coming from.    My marriage is strong and happy and we are conservatives.  We treat each other with mutual respect and unlike another poster so ignorantly expressed Noone is being treated like a dog in our home.    EDIT:  there goes Bostonian again speaking when she has no clue what she's talking about.  My supposed "cavemen mentality" conservative husband cooked me dinner last night and brought me flowers.  He takes care of our daughter while I work and he also cleans?!  This is, of course, all after he has "beat me blue."

Also boombing countries in the east, for example India and China have fast growing economies and a high birth rate. The economy will only shrink if the population becomes lower as well, because more workers will retire and die, than new ones coming into the system to replace them. This will cause 'degeneration'. It is also highly immoral, unethic, inumane and illegal to kill any human being.|`|vRz1QJeWaa	Of course the Liberal leaders want to kill off as many of us "lower class" people as they can.....and those that are lucky enough to have parents that actually care can live in their shadows...or so they think.    I wonder, when the Republicans take the power back, should we try Obama and Pelosi and all the other rats in office right now for the Murderous ways of Killing Innocent Life?  That is a trial I would love to follow in the court room, lord knows the media won't cover it.       Also a note, isn't it interesting that while running for office, everything was about the "Middle and Lower Class" but with this bill, there is nothing for the "Middle American".   Just another way for them to have blood on their hands and kill off the lower classes.|`|Ko2QX3Cvaa	Well, since abortion raises such a fuss with the right wingers, maybe they would prefer if hysterectomies and vasectomies were made to be a tax deductible health expense, and covered in full for those on govt assisted health care.|`|1f2d7c63654f19e2f84fe4695357337eaa	Get back to us when you post the actual facts.   Okay?  Tx|`|jjt2enntaa	What babies are you talking about?  The ones killed in the wars we start?

People need to look outside primitive religion and misguided political correctness and embrace government funded abortion on demand.    In ten years it would make a huge dent in our social program costs  In 20 years it would reduce the prison population and crime.     If stem cell meds live up to the hype the entire abortion on-demand program would be a God-send to American health care and might even turn a profit.       Let's get out there and harvest those unwanted fetuses and turn them into useful Stem cells before they can turn into the dregs of society!|`|DCeAcP7kaa	Can I get a version of the story that isn't twisted around to the point it make no sense please?|`|AA11409272	As economic stimulus, the abortion age limit has been raised to include children up to two years old.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	According to Nancy Pelosi (D - California) it is.

zH0h0Tr0aa	Government Oversight  POGO is an independent nonprofit that investigates and exposes corruption and other misconduct in order to achieve a more accountable federal.  The Project On Government Oversight (POGO), founded in 1981 by Dina Rasor as the Project on Military Procurement, is an independent non-profit organization in the United States that investigates and exposes corruption and other misconduct to achieve a more honest, open, and accountable federal government. POGO investigates federal agencies, Congress, and government contractors. More than 20 years ago, POGO made its mark by uncovering Pentagon waste, fraud, and abuse by bringing to light the infamous $640 toilet seats, $7,600 coffee makers, $436 hammers and other overpriced spare parts used by the military. POGO is currently led by executive director Danielle Brian.    POGOs range of investigations has expanded to include national defense and homeland security; abuse in government contracting; excessive secrecy that fails to consider the public good; and mismanagement of natural resources by federal agencies. POGO uses investigative journalism techniques to shed light on the government's activities, including working with whistleblowers and anonymous sources and accessing information through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). POGOs Federal Contractor Misconduct Database has become an important tool for investigative journalists and others who want to stay on top of this important issue.    Corporate whistleblowers and government insiders bring POGO many of its investigative topics. POGO informs the public of its findings, in large part through reports that contain extensive documentation and recommendations for how to solve the problems identified. Once a report has been released, many more insiders usually approach POGO to provide further documentation and information. By gathering information and building relationships with whistleblowers and government insiders (at the congressional and agency levels), as well as by collaborating with other non-profit organizations, POGO is able to get to the root of the issues in question. We can then provide realistic recommendations for solving age-old problems that have plagued the government and the services it is responsible for providing.    By applying internal and external pressure through the media, the public, government insiders, and policymakers, POGO helps ensure that the federal government implements policies and programs in a manner that benefits all Americans.

Your logic of "everyone else does it too" is flawed. It is like being pulled over for speeding, others may be doing it, but you were the one to get caught. It does not make you any less guilty.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	Yes it happens all the time, but he got caught.

AA11752525	In this computer age you can virtually guarantee that all government contacts and involvement will live in the memories of big brother somewhere.        Many deferred adjudications terminate with case dismissal and the time differential used as a Court tool to determine likelihood of a repeat of the illegal behavior.  If this is your circumstance, your case dismissal clears your need to reveal any convictions in connection with this case.       While you are in the deferred adjudication period, a background check will likely find a pending criminal action.  You can see if this is brought forward by your prospective employer or use your deferred adjudication as an offer of  proof that you are unlikely to be convicted in this matter.       This revolves around the question of criminal convictions. Innocence, guilt or discharge by whatever basis requires an affirmative response to whether you have ever been arrested...|`|oHglbD5Xaa	no a defered judgment goes away when you complete the terms of probation. nothing shows up on a background check unless you are convicted of it anyway|`|WrDGhduxaa	It depends, sometimes the adjudication will disappear after you have completed your term.  You can have an attorney file a motion with the court to have your arrest and record, "non disclosed" meaning that no one can see it except for government agencies.  Your employers would not be able to see the arrest.

DcVoq5Tuaa	get back with your attorney. This isn't fair to move the kids school once again because its an inconvenience to him. Keep them where they are. Don't interrupt their education for him. Also, don't pick up the kids and take them to him, make him find his own way there. You do not have to cater to him. It's not your fault his license is suspended.|`|29fa5460a9c16006e5e07e22271195c2aa	If your children live with you more than 50% of the time I would keep them in the district they are in. If you evenly share 50-50 then I would talk to the kids and see what they want to do. Even at 9 and 10 they have opinions. Also if you do put them in the other school I would get something signed by him in writing and notorized stating he will pay for your gas for driving them when it is his days to have them. Get an amount set in writing. Be realistic on the amount but keep in mind the wear and tear on a vehicle and the gas prices. I personally wouldnt keep changing my kids school. Not in the middle of the school year. It is hard on the kids.
WrDGhduxaa	they asked us if we had family in the military or congress or something important, I think they were trying to cover their a$$ so as not to strike a general's son.  Just because your family member is in the military is not going to get you any easier treatment unless he is the commanding general.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	It doesn't make any difference who you are married to or not married. Most of the instructors don't even know your status. Some people are sons and daughters of other military or other important people and aren't treated better or worse either.    You should by all means be treated no better or worse than any other recruit you are with. What ever happens to you will be because of what you do or not do.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	It will probably be known the the DI that you are married to a service member. Trust in them to be professionals and neither show favoritism nor "abuse" you because they know your husband is a soldier! Some will and they should not. And I don't mean anything bad by abuse, I just couldn't come up with a better word. Best of luck to you and your husband. You have really shown your commitment to your country!|`|leqeslrFaa	I can relate somewhat as I'm currently in the recruitment process myself. I have training later this year. Though I'm serving in the Australian Defense Force however some of what I say will relate.    The best advice I've heard is "Be the Grey man". I'm not sure if it extends to American colloquialisms but what the saying means is try to avoid nay attention to yourself.     Drills Sergeants are professional arseholes.  They have to be strict, often abusive to instill respect and discipline into recruits. I've heard basic is hard, but one of the most rewarding expererience of a servicemen or women's life.    In short I'd avoid mentioning anything like "I'm married", "I miss home" or "It's my birthday" for such statements are catalysts to allow the Drill Sergeant to chew you out.    I'm 19, but if I were married I would remain silent of any signifcant others, unless you feel comfortable to express this to a fellow recruit.    Hope this helped somewhat. Goodluck and thanks for your service (even though I'm aussie); it is honorable to serve one's nation.|`|RetjXEmmaa	Here in Aus.. not at all.    Generally, they wont know unless you tell them. And if you tell them.. they might think your looking for special treatment because of it -- and then you'll get special treatment alright :D    But pretty much.. keep it to yourself (especially if the lads in another service!). Basic is not physically demanding anywhere in the world; it is however, mentally taxxing in learning to function as a member of a military organisation.     But a good bit of advice would be to any additional information not requested to yourself.. and never volunterr anything. Im sure you'll have a ball!
WrDGhduxaa	Ethics are like morals, we know what is right and what is wrong.  If you do something that you know all of your friends and family will become aware of and it would embarrass or shame you then it is wrong.

12UWExlLaa	You need to find out if he entered the US with a visa or came here without inspection. If he had a visa you can marry him and petition for him yourself. If he didn't have a visa there is nothing you can do.   If his immigrant visa petition does come he will have to be interviewed in his home country. Since he has been in America all this time with no right to be here his visa will be denied and he will be banned from returning to the USA.  You MUST talk to a good immigration lawyer as soon as you can.
rMDHNPnEaa	There are plenty of vegetarians in the military. Most mess halls have salads and other vegetable dishes...    It might be harder to do a strict vegan diet. If you avoid all meat and animal products (eggs, cheese) then it is much more difficult, but it still can be done.    But if you are like most vegetarians and just don't eat the meats, but still eat a few other things then you should be fine.    I was never forced to eat anything when I was in the military. I was generally given plenty of options. There were a few times when the food wasn't so great. Like when the ships galley had to shut down because of no water...and we had to eat bologina sandwiches and potato chips...but that doesn't happen too often. Even then you could get a peanutbutter sandwich as an option. There is plenty of peanutbutter on a ship. I think it is still issued in MREs too.|`|7KBCQn6Baa	Yes of course you can. I know people in my unit who are vegan even. I even tried the vegetarian route myself. Didn't last too long though. Anyway, there are many options when it comes to military chow. They even have Kosher MRE's (meals ready to eat) upon request. Even during basic training you don't have to be subjected to meat eating exclusively. You'll be fine :)|`|UXOegnWvaa	yes, there are a variety of choices in the chow hall, but I suggest learning to like meat if you want to serve, your going to need the protein because of all of the physical exertion you will be putting your body through.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Ya why couldnt you? I dont know if they have vegitarian meals but you can join if you want.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Well of course you can  .  You don't have to like every thing in every thing you belong to do you  .  If you did you would be a living in a shopping cart under the express way over pass  .|`|BmIgpoPlaa	You'll be awfully hungry.|`|ppMp9mcPaa	they give you meat and meat only (to keep you strong)|`|X6aDkjpHaa	yeah i guess so i mean it doesn't say that u need to eat met on the registration im pretty sure

t4YoOX1paa	I've been out of work for month and months and months dear . I worked a total of two months out of last year . Yes its  causing people not to sleep . I'm up all hrs of the night and my blood pressure is through the roof . Hang in there and trust in God, He always provides, Even though we sometimes worry about him coming through for us. God bless.|`|sVdQSMvJaa	My sleepless nights are due to a rowdy 10 month old not the economy.  I don't let things I have no control over keep me awake.  You can't lose sleep worrying when you have no control over the state of the economy.      As far as relaxing, prayer always works for me.|`|8rGZFBKOaa	No insomnia here, primarily because I know from where my Help comes from. However, I do know there's a whole new level of Faith one needs when you are officially out of work and the bills continue to roll right on in, not to mention one still has to eat.     I'd check into unemployment, make a daily goal of say 5 or 10 places to apply (it's your list so you choose the number), go online, check the newspapers, consider a wider circumference of travel to and from a job, make use of employment offices, and pray. If you have to amp it up, pray and fast. Need more? Take Communion daily or at least more often than you already do and ask God for Guidance and Favor and Direction........ then do what He says. The energy you set in motion by doing all of this will come back to you with a Blessing and maybe even more than just one!    Blessings to you and yours.|`|AA11268819	No.  All I did was put my worries at the feet of God and left them there.  I have been out of work for sometime now.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	I used to take melatonin and switch back and forth with that and St. Johns Wort.     Hey, I need to email you about something. You seem to be one of the only ones that think I'm not crazy so can you send me your email address in an email because I can't email you from yahoo answers. I wanna let you know about something...|`|otKIUViRaa	Yes it is troubling and if you have this on your mind all the time you will lose sleep.  Try walking before you go to bed read some thing positive, watch a comedy on tv, avoid watching the news in the evening this will help.  Do not listen to people who blame everything on everyone else, our government and financial institutions in their greed have caused this recession.  It is true the people have been misled and better control of our finances should have been preached. I think we will all learn a lesson from this recession.  It is time to get Mad and call for more government control. We can not let our government officials act without saying anything. We have stood by and let greed ruin this country.|`|0s190C7Zaa	NO just the unwillingness to spend a single nickle unless it is importance is needed or required.|`|cWuumdy7aa	By your worrying thing will not be fine. its normal that after a boom period a bear phase comes and will be followed by another boom period just take thing as it comes. we have to face the situation bravely with minimum spending.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	Have faith and think positively. Worrying won't do you any good it will just ruin your health.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	I have not lost any sleep over it    In fact my business is doing just as good now as it has the past few years|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Turn off the news. Obama is purposely causing fear in order to get his agenda passed.|`|RMjcHfGTaa	I let it do cause me loss of sleep and some major frustration last fall.  But I had to catch myself and refocus. I still watch the news and keep current, but I also listen more to advice from my mom and other elderly people who lived through tough times.  I am a lot more thankful too because I look at 3rd world countries and think to myself, man we think we have it bad, we in America don't know what bad is.  I have been blessed with finding a part-time job on top of my regular job. I stinks to have to work two jobs, but it beats no work and it helps to pay the bills. It also gets me out of the house and where I can meet some new friends. I figured my budget and I could go without the 2nd job now that I got a couple debts paid off, but I plan to keep working so I can have a little savings.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	No but it sure does bother me I have to admit.|`|57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	Yeah, dont listen to political bigmouth pundints and believe in yourself to make your own way in life.    Things arent that bad actually other than the countless idiots out there who bought more house than they could afford.    America will rebound, shes always has!|`|CG5NnL8Yaa	I've had alot of sleepless nights over the past 8 years.
AA12151645	When I first read this question, I was at work and had to turn the heating up because my blood runs cold when I think about some of these things even when it was 25 degrees C.    Every soldier starts his military career as a civilian and in the West we generally grow up with a distinguished line defining right from wrong. Acts of violence are usually seen as wrong although we virtually all experience some form of violence throughout our lives.    Those who voluntarily join the military (myself included) are on a path of extremes even though most tell themselves they are doing it for sensible career reasons. Most accept that the ordinary world is just not enough for them and they are looking for more. Many can't put that in to words easily.    We change forever as soon as we set foot in a combat zone. Our families stay the same, just wanting us to survive. Friends want to tell us the right thing so that we feel better etc.    As this question is about the current situation, it's impossible to avoid talking about Iraq, Afghanistan and their surrounding areas. Anybody who has been to Iraq knows that the country and it's people are worse off now than it was under Saddam Hussein. None of it's people want Uk and US soldiers there. Both governments are unhappy with leaving the country to be taken over by another Saddam but it is inevitable.    If you encounter such a situation, you are struck by the futility of the whole situation. All the pointless death and injury just goes on and on and you feel exhausted by it all. Then you return to your own country where people can be just as fanatical, obsessive and brainwashed as over there. People talking to me about "the enemy" always infuriated me. They would lecture me about things they knew nothing about which would end up with me arguing with them.    I guess I started to feel that I didn't want to be around those people then. You just want to be away from the hostility of human beings. I was lucky because none of my civvy friends or family asked awkward questions. They let me talk when I wanted to but didn't start spouting off.    You can't tell a soldier he is doing the right thing when you haven't got a clue what ops he has been involved in. It's offensive when people do. It would be better if people just avoided the subject. There's no conclusion or victory parades to these wars, they just go on. There's no reason to feel proud of what you have done because there's little to be proud of. And it's not for civilians to judge what we have done. Civilians and the press do not understand combat. The prime example was the press uproar at the beginning of the Iraq war about the soldier who shot the guy laying down injured. I would have done the same thing in his situation and so would everybody else I know. It's a fact of life when you're in a combat zone where people blow themselves up.    "Charging people here with murder is like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500."    Why the high suicide rates? Because when you come back you can't relate to the careless, feel-good world around you and all those people who have no appreciation of the truth and the importance of being decent to others. The reason people kill themselves is because they don't want to feel the painful way they do and it is their only escape.    Anybody who says they enjoy war has never been to war. Making a media circus out of it is one of the sickest things imaginable.    For any soldier who is reading this and who is having suicidal thoughts, the pain will go away and you will accept your feelings. The world won't be a better place because it never was. If you are going back to war, don't think about the morals too much. Just do your job professionally and don't lose yourself to your negative emotions. Killing yourself won't make things any better it just brings more misery in to the world.|`|m2YuRw7Vaa	Because they see people getting shot and killed in front of them every 10 minutes. They're getting shot at constantly. They see dead bodies laying in the street with street dogs picking at the flesh on them. Soldiers feel they are responsible for dead women and children. Every time you kill a man, you've just killed some kids father. All the casualties in Iraq are NOT just terrorist. Innocent people are getting caught in crossfire. My friend said he has seen infants dead in the street from gun fights, and explosions. It's all causing post dramatic stress. Which can lead to suicide. It doesn't matter if your country is supporting you or not. When you see women and children laid out in a pool of blood everyday, it F*cks you up mentally.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Caught between a rock and a hard place?    Most of this war is counter insurgency, where troops are waiting for the enemy. Roadside bombs are the art of terror and every tour is a stressful tour.    They come home on leave and the country they serve is in a worse state than when they left. There's nothing to look forward to on leaving the army.    Into that there's the huge number of personnel involved and the accuracy of today's record keeping. Servicemen have always been at the high end of a suicide possibility, war might enhance that, but it certainly doesn't reduce it.    I also find it rather strange they would willingly publish the figures without another agenda as it's not likely to increase recruitment. Interesting question.|`|27vAxPSnaa	cos people are reading stuff like this instead of making friends and music like we did in former decades?|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Almost all of the soldiers I know feel disrespected every day. Everywhere they go they are told that they are part of a lie and such.   Society really makes them feel like they are worthless-POS.  They arent allowed to have pride in what they do, everyone just tears down on them all the time. It has a terrible effect on them.   Some of them are lucky enough to have support from family and friends, but the majority do not get close to what a soldier needs to be mentally healthy. Someone said that many split with their wives after even short deployments, what kind of support is that?|`|h1lDGNp4aa	I wonder if it hasn't something to do with the fact that many of them have served in Iraq 2 and sometimes even 3 tours because of the shortage of military personnel.  And often against their will.  The stress level must be incredible and I imagine it would increase with each tour.  To wonder almost every day if this day will be the last.  To see friends blown to bits or severely disabled.  It can't help but take a heavy toll on a person's psyche.  And when they finally get home, their psychiatric medical care isn't adequate (at least that's what I've read).  I think it's terrible how our service men and women are treated once they've come home.  I'm not surprised at all that the suicide rate is high.|`|f00589104255977086e57a356d925224aa	Bullying?|`|PPKuHl9baa	I'm surprised they even published this information. They usually keep this kind of stuff under wraps along with the divorce rate and such. I know that in my 5 years I knew 3 people that committed suicide and probably over 40 divorces including my own. I went on a 4 month cruise on board a Navy frigate with 25 other gentlemen in the Air Detachment and out of that 25, I'd say about 10 came back in divorce., That's 4 months! Also, 1 of those suicides were during that cruise as well. Someone got a DUI and offed them self because their career was over.|`|BfmV2KpUaa	It says a lot about the current conflicts and the way military personnel feel about why they are there. The people they liberated from Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are now beginning to question why they are still there, and they aren't winning ground. They will clear an area of insurgent threat and a few weeks later find themselves back fighting in the same area again. Most of the duty they perform isn't active combat, but fairly mundane guard duties, making them easy targets. The other jobs have been taken up by civilian contractors.    You have to also consider the current economic crisis and the added stresses it's placing on everyone, not just military personnel. U.S. officials report that 26% of suicides in the army are among troops that haven't been deployed in Afghanistan or Iraq.|`|SMWZSn5vaa	Maybe the rates are high because there aren't enough people telling these soldiers that we are proud of them!  I spent almost 10 years in the Army and that included an Iraq tour.  Besides my family, I don't recall anyone telling me that they were proud of me. I do recall people thanking me for my service and each of you reading this should tell that to the next soldier you see!  Relationship trouble, financial trouble, etc also all have a hand in these casualties.  Just read about a civilian who killed himself and his family including 5 kids so it is not just the military men and women feeling like there is no hope sometimes.  There is HOPE, just believe!|`|tQfDaUnCaa	You thought wrong. The stress level in a combat zone is off the chart. On my first deployment to Iraq (OIF1) I was a 20 year old brand new SGT in charge of 6 people. About 6 months into the deployment one of my 19 year old PFC's decided to put his M16 in his mouth and kill him self about 5 feet from me. When we finally got back to home station after 14 months in theater another one of my soldiers hung him self inside his barracks room. I have had 2 more deployments since then and ive seen it happen in other units. Stresses of war are overwhelming for a lot of people.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	The war causes alot of long-term effects on soldiers.  They see things that nobody should see and then in some sad cases, they are left to deal with it without help.  God bless the people who are stepping up to help those troops coming back...it's unfortunate that they are so brave to defend this country and nobody was helping them deal with the post traumatic stress.
808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	It's called the American way..unfortunately.
RtHq6y78aa	Well, let's see...  1.  Obama wants to steal from middle America for his ridiculous stimulus package and they still love him...  2.  In his book he derides white people and they still love him...  3.  Goes to a racist church....still loved...  4.  Keeps everything about himself a secret....I feel the love...  5.  Votes "present" more than anything else and the love is there  6.  Gives 1st TV interview with a Foreign reporter...love. love, love  7.  Can't walk thru walls/windows as a real messiah should but there is love none-the-less  8.  Appoints ALL recycled Clinton people to an Administration of "change" Can you fell the love tonight?  9.  Said America has 57 states and all 57 states just love him!    ARE PEOPLE THAT FOOLISH?  They should have woken up by NOW.    I have no more faith in Americans.  God help us all.|`|mMaZi9iaaa	First Obama is not any type of God, false or otherwise. He is a man just like any other.   I think that he will make some mistakes, just as EVERY OTHER President has, he is not perfect. I also think that he will make good decisions, just like every other President has (even George W. made a couple). I think that if our country was able to give George W. a second shot, at running the country, all of the Obama naysayers should give President Obama his opportunity too. Then again it doesn't really matter what the naysayers SAY because Obama supporters VOTED and put that man into office!!!!|`|97VqHCIRaa	I've never in my life heard a democrat say he is the messiah.

The Obama worshipers are stupid.|`|Wx1W1vSeaa	I don't know, but still we don't know for sure if Obama is a False God or not. What I do know is that he is gonna get us into big trouble and we are going to regret not electing John McCain, but hey that's what we get for electing Barack Hussein Obama.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Can you guys get another line already, the messiah idea is only around because it would take a god to get us out of the mess the Republican Decider left for us.  Reminding people of that, isn't going to get you back in the majority anytime soon.  Thank the Decider for that.|`|38a6a271a6f3afff0a706e5aae1f9057aa	People don't worship Obama as a Messiah.  Most people just like him, I know that's hard for certain people to understand.  He's not a messiah at all, he's just something better than we've had for awhile.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	No. They never will.

I never did like him and this is one more reason.|`|dfSc0AbGaa	Yeah it kind of does bother me. I am pro-life so this is something I definitely don't agree with. However, I don't expect everything he does I'll agree to. I suppose it's probably all a part of a bigger plan and I wouldn't condemn him until I was able to see everything that he sees and have all the information he has.|`|uo60oMWLaa	thats not the change the US needs and I didn't vote for him.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No because this is just a small part of a package aimed at helping the poor in poverty stricken countries with their birth control issues since most of them have no access to it as we do here.|`|JLayHNZCaa	I believe that was for sex education, providing condoms to avoid unwanted pregnancies and disease and to tell them abortions are available, and maybe some assistance for the abortions if they need them.

These restrictions are printed on the ID cards issued to them. I have known people wait as long as 12 years for their status to change from aslylum seeker to refugee.    Refugees are entitled to Jobseekers' Allowance and other state benfits and are allowed to work.    European Union citizens may claim benfits.    People in the UK on the Highly Skilled Migrant programme, on Work Experience or on Student visas may not claim state benefits. This is also stamped in their passports.

I practice personal responsibility and for that I get to pay in about $20,000 a year in taxes to the Fed.

But in a larger sense, having the government employ people keeps them off the unemployment rolls when private business is laying off people by the thousands.  If those thousands stay unemployed then we see a lack of money in the general economy, rising foreclosures, homeless people, bad debt affecting future private business expansions, the list is literally endless.

3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	I agree with that thinking, and I also think you should be taxed according to your convictions.  If you support government funding of abortions, your tax bracket should reflect that.  If you want people who don't pay taxes to get a check from the government, you should be taxed accordingly or have that amount deducted from any refund you would receive.  I could go on and on, but you get the idea.  I never pay for anything I don't want or don't need except for when it comes to my tax dollars.  We are about to be driven into poverty by this new Democrat-run government, and the only good news is in four years Obama will be a failure and the Republicans will have figured out how to present a candidate that the people will vote for.

We've had tax cuts.  We're up to our collective @sses in tax cuts and we've had to make up the difference by borrowing money from every sucker on the planet.  I believe that the rule here is that if you borrow, you have to pay back.  When you pay back you have to use tax money plus pay interest.  In the end you're going to pay the taxes anyway, PLUS the interest. Penny wise, pound foolish!  Of course we could simply inflate the currency, that's called 'monetizing' the debt, or we could repudiate the debt...just not pay off all the suckers who lent us all that wampum in the first place.  So much for the full faith and credit of the United States.  Dudes.....ALL of the money should be spent on getting people back to work so they CAN pay taxes.  'Pork' or otherwise a lot of people will have jobs, not unemployment insurance payments.  Holy  $%^, a tax break isn't going to do you any good if you don't have an income to tax.  Am I right?  Of course I'm right!  Of course other things have to be done as well.  Like dumping our screwball 'trade policies' that traded our national prosperity and security for 'Everyday Low Prices', massive foreign debt and trans-national corporations that used their 'tax breaks' to buy each other out to increase market share and to shed a couple of million wage-earners.  Wage earners who now pay no taxes because they don't have jobs. Pfizer just bought out Wyeth for 68 billion dollars and dumped 8,000 former wage earners into the already overcrowded streets.  Guess where they got that 85 billion?  Yep!  Tax breaks!  We also need to get the hell out of our two wars...a couple of billion bucks a day in borrowed money ain't hay.

yvPA8FSsaa	Neo actually means "new".  But in practice, it is often meant to be derogatory.  The term Neo-Conservative or Neo-Con originally referred to people who recently converted to Conservatism from Liberalism.  It was intended to be dismissive of them as some kind of traitors to the various Liberal causes.     The Neo-Cons sometimes get hit from both sides.  This is because some are not yet 100% Conservative but still in the process.  The Old School Conservatives sometimes get frustrated when they do not reflect all of the Conservative dogma.  Neo-Cons find themselves in a gray area, rejected by the Liberals and not yet fully accepted by the Conservatives.      It is just part of paying ones dues to become a Conservative.  Conservatism requires thought not just emotion.  Liberalism is much easier.  As a Winston Churchill once said, "A lie can travel half way around the world before the truth gets his pants on".      *|`|5d9pCmjyaa	As a socially liberal minded, fiscally conservative libertarian, I gave Jacques L a thumbs up.    What does that tell you?|`|W0buucLsaa	Neo-conservative means hawkish foreign policy and interventionism. Basically, neo-cons try to bring about democracy and capitalism in countries that don't have it. It's like Manifest Destiny. Neo-conservatism also takes a strong federal government approach, and advocates increasing the power of the executive branch.     Neo-cons are a faction of the modern Republican party; they aren't really conservative.in some respects. A traditional conservative would be in favor of decreasing the power of the federal government, a strong system of checks and balance on the executive, and isolationist or close to isolationist foreign policy.    One of the fundamental aspects of conservatism in all arenas, whether political or not, is prudence and dislike of change. Neo-conservatives advocate change in foreign governments and in how the federal government fundamentally operates.    Many southern Democrats could be considered neo-cons, except that they tend to be economically liberal (and are socially conservative, which means they get along with neo-cons better than some Republicans do).|`|RJDDC5Kgaa	Neo conservatives used to be liberals.  Ronald Reagan for example, made the transition.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	dont ask the liberals on here    They clearly do not know the answer|`|UXKMNkdgaa	The neo is the media's attempt to make conservatives sound more sinister.

It's a person that used to be liberal and switched parties.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	Neo-Liberalism is the philosophy of the neocons.  http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=...    Neo conservatives are pro-bombing, pro-empire heavyweight intellectuals who have filled the vacuum on the Right, where most Americans have little interest in foreign policy. They dominate Republican foreign policy because they care about it, whereas most Americans don't. NATO expansion was an example; most Americans don't think about it and don't care. "Neo cons" do. Also they heavily influence the Democratic Party from whence they came. They are close to European Social Democrats, many of whom have also now favor pro-interventionist wars, since the collapse of communism.    "Neo conservatives" are mostly former leftists/liberals who converted to conservatism during the '70's and when Ronald Reagan became President. In domestic policy they tend to be moderate "welfare" Republicans. However, their major concern is foreign policy. They strongly favor US military interventions overseas and becoming the worlds policeman. They promoted the First Iraq War and are constantly the instigators for more confrontation with Iraq, Iran, the Sudan, and other Muslim states. They were among the chief instigators of the Kosovo War.|`|nwHaxG6Oaa	Neo means new. A new way of conservatism.

That differs slightly from a conservative in that a conservative in the United States is primarily devoted to what is best for the American citizen by maintaining the freedoms established in the Constitution. In other words, conservatives believe that it is the people that make this country great through their rugged individualism and entrepreneurial spirit. Government generally suffocates that spirit.    And just for the record, by definition of neocon, our wonderful socialist president, Hussein Obama would be considered such. He spouses conservative words, but his actions are blatantly socialist.      EDIT:  Jacques L, if it was not for conservatism, you would not be living in the greatest country there has ever been. What's more, as conservatism is continuously removed from our government by these liberal socialist democrats, I want you to remember what your life was like under Reagan, Bush I and Bush II. You will be crying for conservatism back in government within the next 2 years. I personally guarantee it.
HLHHM4Mtaa	As I recall, Obama and Biden both promised that they intended national health care for the nation that was the "exact same" as members of Congress have.  That promise can be taken in one of two ways; 1) we will all soon be getting premium health care at absolutely no charge (aside from a 50% tax rate for the middle class), or 2) they are both absolute and complete liars running a con game on the voters who fell for it.  I didn't.  Big question is, when it comes time for delivery on their "promise," will the saps who fell for it hold them accountable?  ...and the answer to that is, "no."  They'll be happy with anything, any time, anywhere, so long as a "D" is attached to the legislation i.e., Legislation; "I'm gonna slap yo mama "D!"

If you think Obama is going to let anything like that get across , we are in a sad state . Something like that might really help someone . There are so many people out of work right now that many people do not even have health insurance . Teachers in Texas had their insurance go up from 76 dolllars a month to 208 and my daughter recently had a baby and to add the baby to the insurance it will cost her 576 dollars a month .

But that does not mean that universal healthcare is wrong.      FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.

If more of the same worked, we'd ALL be sitting in high cotton.|`|V74QiNi3aa	This might work  Here is part of the plan thought of, but the government does not want to listen to history or to someone who has experiences in dealing with problems.    A) Scrape the present taxation system completely, and create a flat tax of 17.5% across the board regardless of income. This would create an increase of take home money to the people of about 55.5%  B) Ask all Canadians to accept a wage and salary freeze for a period of 3 years @ 2008 levels. (Except for politicians who truly care for this country and its people. see next point)  C) Politician should be willing to be leaders in tackling this problem since they are part of the solution/issue.  - Therefore they should take a pay cut of 34%. This would release Millions of dollars to be re-allocated.  - Also, thier pension plans should fall in line with the guidline of the average Canadian based on the Maxium allowable under the Canada Pension Plan.  - The removal of the 8 year clause for quailifing for full pension.  D) implement a reward or penality system in regards to business/corporations as follows:  Reward - no taxes to be applied up to an amount of $1 Billion of Gross profits if 25% of that amount is re-invested in Canada only (not oversea ventures). This would help create jobs, build infrastrues, broaden employment, educate workers, and help stimulate the economy of the future. (ie: expansions, r&d, new products, new program.) This also allows companies the pride of giving back to this country.  Penality - 32% tax for any amount of money sent out of this country. This helps Canada because it is compensation for lost of present and future revenue. (ie: jobs lost or not created)  To help equal out the playing field pass legislation to cap the gross mark-up/profit margins of selling goods 35.3%. This would create a competitive field for better quality and workmanship. Because the present taxation system would be scraped there would not be a manufacturing tax, HST, GST or PST.  In regards to Provincial/Federal Crown Corporations they must follow the guidline just like everyone else.    For students who recieve loans allow them the same amount of time to pay back the loan as it took them to get into debt interest free  ie: if they borrowed for 5 year then allow them 5 years to pay it all back. Any outstanding balance after their interest free period, would then become due or interest will be added to that balance at prime + 1.5%|`|i5F2jwvhaa	first step is stop all pork spending    Something porkbama has no intention of doing    Funny how libs dropped their " you can not spend your way out of a recession" line they used to love to use|`|Ry61ViNZaa	I almost choked on my lunch the other day when I saw Obama on TV toting his economic stimulus plan that centered around immediately creating 500,000 new government jobs to work towards discovery of renewable energy sources.

So much for tolerance of others.|`|zlmnfFpYaa	I'm not really an ID fan, but please explain to me where that first, infinitely small, infinitely dense particle that triggered the Big Bang came from.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Before you go on believing yourself to be so superior in your vast intellect, let me bring a few things to your attention. Despite all the voluminous data both for and against scientific theory or Biblical Canon, the argument comes down to one simple point.    Did the universe always exist or did some sort of intelligent power create it?  Nothing in any scientific journal or text book can answer that question.      So it is up to the individual.  Science cannot help you.  You are now in the realm of "belief".  Here are your choices:    A) The physical universe always was and always will be.  B) There is a Creator who always was and always will be.    Neither can be explained using any science we currently have.  This includes the "Big Bang".  Nothing about the Big Bang Theory says that the Bang was not caused by some intelligent force on purpose.      So before you go looking down your nose at Creationists, remember, their POV is just as valid as the most advanced scientists in the world.  Currently, science is hitting a brick wall.  No theory anyone can concoct fits reality better than the theory of a Creator.  None.  So, while  Creationists "believe" there is a Creator and  you "believe" there is not, neither of your arguments can be proven using the scientific method.  So, it is only a belief.  If you delude yourself that it is somehow a fact, then you need to review your paygrade.    *

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Hi Jim,    EDIT PER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:    As I said, The Fed works, but it's not a perfect system. I agree that there should be a greater degree of accountability. But here's the flaw in Paul's argument...    Congress has all the powers of oversight it needs. No new law needs to be passed for Congress to get all of the information on policies, players, and procedures at the Fed. Congress created the Fed, and Congress can modify, repudiate or destroy the Fed. Contrary to popular belief, the Fed actually does respond to Congress.    The problem isn't secrecy at the Fed, it's Congress (of which Mr. Paul has been a member for some time) not doing their proper jobs of oversight.     And as for Government controlling this, I can only recall the words of the late, great sage, Peter Drucker who once said, "Governments do two things well: wage war and inflate currencies." He was right.    The LAST thing you want is for government to get its grubby hands on the money supply. Why do you think 3rd World currencies are non-convertable? Because these are countries whose government control monetary policy. Politicians like to keep taxes low and money plentiful. Thus, over time, the tendency is simply to print more and more money to ease problems... Next stop, Zimbabwe...    No, I do not trust government to manage the money supply. Politicians do not think in long terms; they only think in electoral cycles. Moreover, they're too narrowly focused on constituency issues to be concerned with the macroeconomic well being of the nation as a whole.    I end where I began -- The Fed isn't perfect, but the alternative is a nightmare of biblical proportions.  =============    I've read your questions for a long time now, and even posted answers to a few. You strike me as an intelligent and thoughtful individual; so let me talk to you as such.    A lot of people are going to post nonsense about the Fed that they saw on some Youtube video, and they're going to unload on the Fed as some gigantic conspiracy (and yadda yadda).     I'm assuming from your question that you already understand the structure and purpose of the Fed, so let me defend it. While I'm no fan of Dr. Greenspan's policies (and indeed, in large measure blame them for the current mess everyone's in) the fact is, the dollar has been well served by the Fed for almost 100 years.    In the 19th century, America had "wildcat bankers" who printed money and caused hyperinflation. Apart from internet conspiracy theorists, nobody thinks we can use gold to back modern currencies. John Maynard Keynes was correct when he characterized gold as a "Barbarous Relic." One of the reasons for slow economic growth in the middle ages was precisely because gold and silver were the currency. A lack of specie always cripples an economy. If you want the possibility of real growth, you must make the currency accountable to market forces of productivity, and free it from other artificial constraints. Money is a measure of economic activity -- not how many bars you have stored in Fort Knox.    The management of currency in a modern economy requires a collaboration between government and banking systems. It's not the easiest thing to understand or explain. And unfortunately, whenever something is difficult to understand, you can always bet on the conspiracy theorists oversimplifying everything for the sake of their own ignorance.    If you look at monetary stability for the century before the Fed, and the near century after its creation, the record is clear -- the Fed has more than fulfilled its mandate. This isn't to say it's a perfect institution; but its success has been such that every major industrial power on the face of the earth has taken steps to emulate it (in one way or another).    I vote for the future, and monetary stability -- not the past and its relics. Hope this helps. Cheers, mate.|`|BkatcMZbaa	Again you got the right person in the field of Currency, Notes & Coins production & control for a country.  Normally,  the printing of currency notes & minting of coins are controlled by the Central Bank in types & quantity and being processed for recycling to save & cut cost.    There must be reserved fund(gold & foreign currencies) in certain percentage or full backing for the issue of currency and its international value & rating go with it.  The accumulated fund will be invested in ways decided by Govt to earn returns.  The fault is not with FEB, but with the Govt System.  No one will take away the Reserve Bank unless new Govt in power or a take over.  It is not easy to set up a system and build up a reserve.  Change & modify the system & method within the set-up to do it right......learn from the well managed country.  There are certain ways to play or manipulate it to your advantage and US is doing it now to China and they are pointing finger at one another........Who is Who in the doing?|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	That was proposed over a hundred years back.  Greenbacks, as opposed to a gold standard.    The problem is, the money is then paper. Worthless.  Money is made so that your bills (in our case dollars) have a value beyond our borders, on the world market. In smaller countries, their currency has no value outside of their country.    Some would suggest that's just fine...but we are a player in the world market, and can't afford the dollar to be worthless. If it were, you would have to trade gold, silver, or something else of value to obtain goods...and that would be a disaster.|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	The whole problem was created when FDR abolished the gold standard in 1933 and the silver standard in 1935.|`|0PQRC8yraa	It will be called the United States of Zimbabwe.|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	Why would you expect bad things to happen when the American people have honest money to use?    The truth is, most Americans are in debt.  They are hooked on credit cards, and can't handle money (actually, currency).  They need to clean up their act.    Getting back to honest money, this means that there would be no inflation.  You wouldn't get a cost of living raise, because the cost of living would not increase.  It would actually decrease!  As technology brings costs down, our standard of living would rise.  We can already see this in high tech items like computers and cell phones.    The only losers would be the bankers who run the Federal Reserve, and our own politicians.  The bankers would loose the interest they earn on the treasury bonds they get for their FRNs.  The politicians would loose the use of newly created "money".  Currently, our politicians get this currency by selling treasury bonds to the Federal Reserve in exchange for more FRNs.  Just as counterfeiters benefit from their product, our politicians use this new "money" before anyone else.  The rest of us see the purchasing power of the paper diminished by the influx of new paper.  This process is called INFLATION.  And inflation is stealing.    Returning to honest money would put an end to stealing by bankers and politicians, and they will fight tooth and nail to prevent it.|`|WU4fChrwaa	I wouldn't abolish the FED, but I would abolish the IRS, as well as most of the wasteful government agencies. Understand that the system that the Federal Reserve has set up is ingenious. Brilliant in design, and a superior money system to that of precious metals. They are surly the modern day equivalent of the alchemists of old. For they have successfully taken labor, and turned it into gold. Gold on the other hand, devalues labor almost to the point of worthless.     Look at the historical effects that gold and precious based money had on the proletariat (working) class.  It creates a society that deals in ingots and one that deals in dust. Serf and Master. You only need to look at the marvelous super cities that were built in the 19th century with the gold standard. The solid marble columns and ornamental details are mind blowing compared to today's architecture. The wealthy inhabited these mansions and estates, while the poor lived in the surrounding country in shacks,  or leased apartments. In contrast there was no middle class.     To those who want to return to gold you must accept the fact that  the appeal of gold backed currency is far more beneficial to the wealthy classes. Those who own the banks and are very wealthy are eagerly waiting for the return of gold. To them,  gold is god.    You see the fault lies in the people and the people alone. By turning labor into gold the fed basically created a middle class.  The middle class is the only ally that the working class will ever have. They are the prime investors of capital and the stimulus of the economy. These same people, being inherently inclined to "satisfy their desires by exerting the least amount of labor" used the system to escape toil, and the fruit of ones labor became profit for another. In doing this the middle class built itself up only to be knocked down. They also devised ways to escape taxation for their profits, leaving the burden to those who could afford it least.    To put such power into the hands of "government"  is very tempting. There are reasons that should be evident to you why a private organization can handle the task more efficiently. That is unless you believe, that government will not abuse such power. Has no drive to create jobs that produce nothing but demanded everything.  And in a sense does not act like a true entity or organism and has no desire to grow.  This however, defies all logic.  And since it wants to grow it must eat, it can be said that governments devour freedom. This is why freedom is less evident in society's that have the most government intervention. It is also why it is unwise to give government total control over the money supply.      We can sit here and cast the blame on the system and say, look what they have done. "They have devalued the dollar to the point of worthless, they have artificially raised or lowered interest rates to spur consumption.  This is all true but they did so only because the people wished it. By using the credit system for business ventures, by taking loans out to buy property and goods.  The people abused the system. They gave us what we wanted. Cheap credit.    Until, we are willing to place the blame on ourselves for the destructive exploitation of the the money supply, we will never solve this financial question. The only answer lies within the people. We must stop using the system for personal gain at the expense of others. Whether thats possible or not depends on us.
mZi7R0Enaa	sure it is. Mitt Romney while Governor of MA, refused any salary. A leader should always lead by EXAMPLE but, with BO, comes a sense of *entitlement* and he will never do anything that doesn't benefit HIM!|`|9FI7zaKraa	How sad that a true poor man, no matter how smart or capable, could never hold a high office due to the fact it takes so much money to get there. Our system is broken, we have no representation that reflects the true working class. only 2 party corruption and the dem and rep sheep that continue to support it.|`|Ry61ViNZaa	Its absurdity.  The left will do what ever they can to put this man on a pedestal.  How can anyone, with a straight face, call the Obamas "poor".      Many citizens who voted for this man and his empty promises are going to have a rude awakening in the coming months.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	I only wish I were that "poor".  But I think it means he had the least amount, not so much that he was poor.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Poor, my @$$.  John Kerry said, outright, that he would refuse the $400,000 salary if he became President.  I think ALL Presidential candidates should waive it if they come in multi-millionaires.  Obama should have waived it if he wanted to bring real change to the W.H.  That would have helped our economy a great deal.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I get what you are saying, I don't get what the person's thoughts were on Obama being a poorest candidate, has nothing to do with your question.  So if I'm thinking right they are equating that he was the poorest so he should have the White House chef?..LOL|`|yS0hSFdOaa	My thought is that person meant he has the least money. Why are you criticizing him for being successful in the first place? It seems like wasted energy to me, don't you have better things to worry about like what goes on in your own life?
AA11206283	I got all that information when I signed my first card. I offered any and all including skin, intestine.....    All means all.    Loved ones have no right to be involved in the decision from the second the completed card is signed|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	There is a giant area on the back of my drivers license that is for listing body parts acceptable for donation.   Almost all states have this.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	Dude, this was all explained completely to me when I signed up with the wife.  Plus, I think this is a bogus story, since when you offer to donate, you sign a form that tells them to jump in and just harvest all they need.  There should be no reason for such an affair to happen.  Then again, maybe that state does it different.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	From your story, the nurse was way out in space bombarding you with these kind of questions, BUT! before his guy died, his wife should have been aware of his intentions! NOT the hospital's fault! What they should have done, was let her say good bye to him, and then whisked him off to have the organs removed!!  They don't mutilate the body, and give him back to be buried all sewn up! Think about all the lives that one person could save!|`|02fdd30cf9904e853e7fdbac52f61769aa	Your correct. Anyone who doubts it can call the National Organ Donation and be informed by  them that it doesn't matter if you have signed proof that you want to be a organ donor or not, it is up to the NEXT OF KIN to consent. Period. So there isn't a way for the hospital to get around asking the next of kin about the organs. They should find a more appropiate way of handling the situtation then what happened in your posting. That was totally inappropiate. At the same time, everyone's next of kin needs to know your wishes and desires. My hubby has stated that he doesn't believe in organ donation, so I went down to my attorneys office and had my daughter made my next of kin concerning any medical decisions and ALL decisions concerning  my body upon my death. Very legal to do and easy. Now I know I will be a organ donor. And my daughther has it in writing as well as to what all i am willing to donate. If someone is serious about being a organ donor, then they should put it in writing and give it to the next of kin, so that they can supply it to the hospital when they give their consent. That would solve the 'organ donor questions' except the consent.    I don't believe that loved ones should have the right to interfer over a person's decision to donate. There should be a way to handle this the same as there are 'living wills'. The argument is that once you are dead you are no longer able to make decisions therefore someone has to consent. Where as in the living will you are still 'alive' at decision time. There needs to be law allowing organ donors the 'right' to do  a 'after-death organ donation' prior to death to where the next of kin and/or family is not legally allowed to have any input over the decisions. We can decide everything else prior to death and have our wishes followed legally, and we need the same for organ donors.
kMYE3vV8aa	Absolutely a good move!  This stimulus package is just wrong to begin with and is only there to satisfy the dems.  I just hope the republicans in the senate have as much backbone as the houe and vote against this thing.  I think conservatives need to send a clear signal to the dem congress that we don't want this lousy package!    I wrote my congress and senate reps and asked them to vote against it.  I suggest you all do the same!|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I agree, I think the Reps did the right thing..we all know the stimulus is going to pass but still think they did the correct thing in voting no.  I'm not that naive to think the voted no just because the package stinks, I think they also know if it blows up in the Dem's face they have a clear shot of getting more Reps in office in the next election.|`|j1A24TFeaa	If the republicans had all the answers we wouldnt be in this total mess. They are the ones that created the mess. They oppose Obama because Obama wants everything to be exposed and its frightening plus they are angry because the country loves Obama and knew that the republicans were unable to stabalize but only destroyed our economy. Personally I give kudos to Obama for reaching out but to me he was reaching out to a bunch of idiots.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	My (democratic, btw) hat is off to them.  Yesterday morning, Obama's huge "stimulus" plan was passed.  Yesterday evening, the news headline on Yahoo homepage stated they now need 700 billion MORE.   Didn't even take 24 hours.  Not every Democrat on these boards believes this is going anywhere good.|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Yes, they still have some backbone. The stimulus is 75% pork. We need tax cuts and incentives for private industry to invest.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	Yep, let the Democrats take the hit by themselves. Obama had already said he could pass it without the Republicans so why try to sway their decision. You can bet the 11 Democrats that voted against it will be "B" slapped by Nancy Pelosi, lol|`|ywOqliwKaa	I hope they keep voting like conservatives! Just because the president wants something does not make it right.     Did anyone notice that eleven (11) Democrats also voted with the Republicans because they did not agree with it. Of course, you probably will not hear CNN talk about that "Bipartisan" vote. All you will hear is how the children eating Republicans hate the poor american people.    I hate the liberal media. They suck, big time.|`|MntRFqtHaa	When it falls flat, when no real jobs are created, no one but the Husseinites will be to blame.|`|mXbQFNP5aa	I was very happy to hear that someone in washington is actually looking out for what is in the best interest of Americans.  This stimulus bill is full of PORK spending and has no immediate relief for tax payers. We as Americans should all stand up and cheer the fact that someone is standing on their principles and standing up for regular Americans.|`|G63mbWAtaa	yes|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	The republicans did the right thing this time. The first time around everyone was duped into the bill. If you have taken the time to read over the bill it really is garbage with rampant spending.   It is simply paying off everyone for votes and support and is nothing more than pork.     The democrat support for the bill really illustrates why we are in the economic situation we are in.     Our government has become a complete joke.|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	It was a very good move on the Republicans part. Now, why couldn't they have done this with the last one as well?|`|AA11665632	Well, I say, the Dems have made their bed, now they will rest in it. It is a good thing I don't wait upon the government to jump start my life.|`|8a3bb05fac18cc11e58899cd0251e212aa	Yes, it was an good move, but the bill passed anyway.  The Republicans plan would have created more jobs at less of a cost.  But at least they got out that ridiculous contraceptive pork, for what it's worth.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Great move.  They were telling Barry that he doesn't have them in his pocket.  And there were 12 Dems that voted against this bailout too.  Now if only the Republican Senators will do exactly the same th ing, it will send Barry a message that THEY mean business.  Ya gotta love em in the House!|`|8ad6fQiNaa	I think that because they are currently the minority, that they're being opposionist just to be opposionist. Obama could support a bill that would guarantee world peace and they would vote against it, claiming that it destroys military jobs.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	I am pleased with the repubs, now when this bill fails we can place blame exactly where it belongs, in the laps of the democrats.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	agree 100% .... this is nothing short of a spending spree, it is NO stimulus package.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	Very good move.  It was a nice feeling to have my Rep actually represent me.  I e-mailed my Rep to thank him.|`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	Great move but it will pass and we will be in even worse shape, for generations.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Great idea    This bill will not help and now the blame falls 100% on the DNC
IJTcGIG7aa	If you are disappointed with Obama after 8 years of Bush, then you are functionally retarded.   You have lost the faculty of reason, the ability to apply rational thought, the capacity to differentiate facts from fantasy or truth from lies.        Obama is doing a great job so far.   He's proving to be a dynamic leader, as competent as billed with policy rooted in reality.|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	Since the day is announced he was running for President.  I'm a conservative, proud of it too.  He is inexperienced and his cabinet is a joke.  Sure, there are some OK's in there, but for the most part, they will turn this presidency "down".  That's my opinion, and while I don't want him to fail because then we all fail, I think that will happen and he will fail.  He's headed in the wrong direction.|`|hexzaIGgaa	Nope, he looks and acts Presidential...which, after 8 years of the Idiot Son, is quite refreshing.    EDIT: ...and what is wrong with acting Presidential? Bush never mastered it. It is too early to judge the barely one week old Obama Administration, but there has been plenty of time to judge the 8 year old Bush administration.     Quit whining and start working...for America.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Yes which is why he didn't get my vote....|`|GvgmSxdCaa	I suppose he deserves a chance to make a change.   But i really don't think he is going to be any Martin Luther King.   I don't think he has the revolutionary flare ...   But that is just my own opinion.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	I never thought I would say this, but G-D I MISS BUSH :(.  I am very disappointed in President Obama...and his big, disgusting spending plan.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	Very, very disappointed with him, I knew he would be bad for us but I didn't expect him to hit the ground running in the wrong direction, I thought he may at least try.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	if you never expect much of a person they can not disappoint you|`|f6OOxJQsaa	No, I expected this crap from him.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	No, why should I be? He is getting things done already.|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Yes|`|XxSj6AsBaa	As predicted he is getting everything wrong immediately.  He has already given an interview on an Arabic network.  Maybe he is already being groomed for his backup job plan with them.  He could do cameo appearances on "How I met your Mullah"    =)|`|OZFhyEw4aa	President Obama is doing everything in his power to keep the promises that he pledged during his campaign. He is working on so many issues, peace between the arabs and the israelis, he is trying to open the doors to bring peace to muslims and americans. He is working on the education system, he wants to bring about health care so that thousands of americans do not die needlessly. Personally everyone I know is so proud of Obama we are bursting with pride. Obama has done more in a week then Bush did in eight years. Where was Bush when Katrina was killing off all those poor people? Bush spent way too much time golfing and loafing around in Camp David. Obama starting working the next day after he was sworn in. I am very very proud of our country that they voted in a great great man.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	I was disappointed when he won election day. I wanted to keep him out of the white house|`|G63mbWAtaa	Obama suxxxxxxxxxx|`|UY2MJtfGaa	No, I expected him to immediately start his socialist agenda and he did.|`|5HeNp5tjaa	Holy crap he hasnt even been in the white house for a month yet give the man a chance jesus rome wasnt build in a day you bigots|`|CZFcH1ykaa	No matter what anyone say's, Obama in my opinion is gonna make a great President and make great changes.

Obama held his head up high during the election while the republicans McCain and Palin tried to destroy him by creating lies and smears. Obama is a good man and wants to work with the republicans. It was very obvious that the republicans are bitter and do not want Obama to succeed. Personally I admire Obama for reaching out the olive branch to a bunch of idiots.|`|kMYE3vV8aa	I love how one person responded no because he "looks and acts presidential".  Good Lord!  Wow, that makes me so proud that he "looks" presidential!      The fact is this guy is way too inexperienced to be in his position.

If parents actually started taking care of the children given them the attention they need during their school life, they would have no need to commit crimes in order to fulfil their existence in society. Not to mention the pressures of jobs have become so competitive that parents are no longer free to take care of the children as they should.    So the crimes in schools is the by-product of slavery to pay endless debts when in essence, money is just a piece of paper at the end of the day. It has no meaning whatsoever. People just are too afraid to admit it.     Prayer would just be laughed upon if placed back into the school. It had nothing to do about crimes and stuff in the first place.

Ro03hVb6aa	Also, it seems socialist for a right wing government to nationalize banks to dig their country club, secret handshake friends out of a jam.|`|TsjqzanQaa	It's interesting and amusing, both.    Thomas had realized that he didn't have a chance of ever being elected, and finally gave up.    However, the pendulum is probably going to swing in the opposite of capitalism for awhile, as the depredations of the Bush/Cheney administration, which seemed intent on taking from the poor and giving to the rich, will require compensating to some degree.    When they let big oil make hundreds of billions of dollars, and Hailburton make about a hundred billion dollars at the taxpayers' expense, Bush/Cheney showed that corruption and incompetence permeated our government all of the way to the top, and Congress did absolutely nothing to stop them.    A mixed economy seems to be what works best.      Pure socialism is what they had in communist Russia and also China, and it has proven not to be a viable economic system (look at Cuba!).    But unbridled capitalism doesn't work, either.     A mixture of the two to some degree seems to be the most efficient economic system.    We're stuck, for the moment with a corrupt Congress, as you noted, and until the voters learn to cast their votes with more intelligence and information, it won't change.    Most of the Congress seems to be intent on taxing, taxing and taxing, and then making the dirty deals with cronies, to line their own pockets and those of friends and families.        Government spending has been out of control for decades, and this isn't going to change overnight.    I'm concerned about Obama's stimulus package, and the vast amounts of money involved are too tempting to Congress, and they'll be trying to delay the implementation, so that they have time to set up the back-room deals, the offshore accounts for the bribes and under-the-table payments that will be huge.    The American people will be stuck with paying for it.    Our government spends money on a monumental scale, squandering the wealth of America on just about anything except that which would actually benefit the taxpayers.|`|NhCECYuUaa	A rose called by any other name would smell as sweet.

The previous president, in 2001, stood with reps from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and did his own spread the wealth speech. If you read the speech on White House website, there is no way to deny the government's role in the housing "crisis". And if you didn't see Bush's name there, you would surely think that Obama gave the speech. Both parties have been infiltrated by this nationless organization of death culture, political zombies.     Besides "humanitarianism" and "equality" and other such things, one thing socialism does is lead to the government's absolute power (every single time.....why does anyone doubt, regardless of their opinion on the subject, that "global warming" has been adopted by the International Socialist Party as it primary concern? Besides the "economic crisis" that they can benefit from, the environmental policies proposed are powerful enough to, not only transform entire economies and political structures, but also to "internationalize" these concepts as well, which is there goal), but as I was saying, why wouldn't people who desire this power infiltrate the Republican Party as well and commence with the most trusted tool of these types of organizations.....divide and conquer?    In response to a previous answer's concern with "unbridled capitalism," that does not exist. The government has been in bed with the capitalists, they protect them, they fight wars for them, they perpetuate monopolies with them. The opposite of this is not a "mixed economy". It's already mixed, the government and the capitalists.    The opposite of this is the FREE MARKET. The government is inherently corrupt, I don't know why, it is just in its' nature, so why trust them to regulate the market anymore than private regulatory bodies? When a stock market crashes, and people jump out of windows, then that should teach people to behave different economically, it's where learning should be. But the government steps in and says, "DON'T LEARN, you don't have to, we will use your money to prop up an illusion.|`|CG5NnL8Yaa	1944?  Never heard of him.

dWH45KTlaa	Will this help?    Good luck on your homework        California vs. Greenwood  Supreme Court         Supreme Court Decision on Garbage Privacy  SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES  486 U.S. 35  January 11, 1988  May 16, 1988     CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEAL OF CALIFORNIA, FOURTH APPELLATE DISTRICT     Acting on information indicating that respondent Greenwood might be engaged in narcotics trafficking, police twice obtained from his regular trash collector garbage bags left on the curb in front of his house. On the basis of items in the bags which were indicative of narcotics use, the police obtained warrants to search the house, discovered controlled substances during the searches, and arrested respondents on felony narcotics charges. Finding that probable cause to search the house would not have existed without the evidence obtained from the trash searches, the State Superior Court dismissed the charges under People v. Krivda, 5 Cal.3d 357, 486 P.2d 1262, which held that warrantless trash searches violate the Fourth Amendment and the California Constitution. Although noting a post-Krivda state constitutional amendment eliminating the exclusionary rule for evidence seized in violation of state, but not federal, law, the State Court of Appeal affirmed on the ground that Krivda was based on federal, as well as state, law.     Held:  1. The Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the warrantless search and seizure of garbage left for collection outside the curtilage of a home. Pp. 39-44 .     (a) Since respondents voluntarily left their trash for collection in an area particularly suited for public inspection, their claimed expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items they discarded was not objectively reasonable. It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left along a public street are readily accessible to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public. Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through it or permitted others, such as the police, to do so. The police cannot reasonably be expected to avert their eyes from evidence of criminal activity that could have been observed by any member of the public. Pp. 43-44 .|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	US Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals of the State of California, 4th Appellate District.    http://wikipedia.org/wiki/California_v._...  http://www.soc.umn.edu/~samaha/cases/cal...|`|AA11752525	The Greenwood decision is a 4th Amendment case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court to determine if U.S. Constitutional rights from illegal search and seizure attached to garbage voluntarily abandoned and intended for en mass collection.         I believe  a 6-2 majority held that individuals have no reasonable right under the U.S. Constitution to expect to have their rights protected after taking abandonment steps to dispose of property where no privacy could be expected from playing children, recyclers or trash hunters. Therefore, the police is free to go through one's garbage and collect information that may be freely used to arrest and convict without violating the search and seizure protections otherwise granted and existing under the U.S. Constitution.                  This issue  was likely raised in a Federal  District trial Court then Federal Appeals Court and finally petitioned to the U.S. Supreme Court.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	He was a conservative. All he had to be was honest to the American people about his principles. Less Government is better Government. Less spending is better spending. The economy grew. Unfortunately, he suffered under a democrat congress. When he cut taxes, government took in more money due to the circulation of currency which caused an economic boom. However, the democrat congress spent more money than he took in. He was unable to curtail profligate democrat spending which was the downfall of his presidency. As usual, the democrats blamed a republican for the problems the democrats caused.

His administration was scandal ridden from the first day to its last day with over 170 top officials indicted or forced to resign because of criminal behavior. However, if they wrapped themselves in the flag and praised the Lord their crimes were swept under the rug. He pressed Congress to label ketchup a vegetable so he could cut spending for the school lunch program and expand his Star Wars program. He sent Marines ashore in Beirut and when the Hezbollah murdered hundreds of them, he ran like a whipped cur. He then invaded tiny Grenada scaring the bejeebers out of a few Cuban construction workers. Now thats a war to be proud of American tanks against Cuban wheelbarrows. He thought ICBMs could be recalled after they were launched. Its a miracle that he didn't blow the **** out of this planet. He cut the taxes of the rich and afterwards raised the taxes on the poor and middle class. The CIA's report on the downfall of the Soviet Union proves Reagan had nothing to do with the downfall of communism. In fact, the report points out that Polish unions and other dissentients were a major cause in the downfall of the Soviet Union.

So the ruling classes treated the 'British' just the same - it was a commodity. It was not illegal in China or Britain - in fact no where was it illegal.    Edit - yet another historical item taken out of context.    Edit - It was only illegal in the UK in 1967 for starters (The misuse of drugs act) - tell me one country it was illegal in at the time?    "Opium was not illegal in England at the time, however, where comparably smaller quantities were imported to be smoked."    " Lin Zexu, Governor-General recognizing the consequences of opium abuse, embarked on an anti-opium campaign in which 1,700 opium dealers were arrested and 2.6"    "Considering that importation of opium into China had been virtually banned by Chinese law" - so not quite illegal|`|ifzRsvJlaa	Another pointless question - why do people ask questions like this - what if the moon was made of cheese or the Romans had invented the steam engine - maybe the point of the question is to drag up some animosity between the UK and China based on events that cannot be changed - everyone involved died a long time ago - for goodness sake MOVE ON
mZi7R0Enaa	the ONLY requirement for a Hollywood star is megalomania. Oprah has a program that is for *women* yet she refused to have Sarah Palin as a guest, so the big O is through with me also. I, like you, will no longer patronize movies with uber liberals and their big mouths.|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	Oprah was a Hillary supporter until Obama came along.  Gee, I wonder why.    The limousine liberals from Hollywood, or their plush "farms" in New Jersey, are liberals simply out of guilt.  They know that they can't expect their "fans" to support them if they appear to be elite.  Therefore, these "stars" speak out for the poor (even though Democrats average 6% higher salaries than Republicans) because they want their common man fans to relate to them.      However, how many of these limousine liberals do you see giving up all but a 15-year-old car and a 1,100 sq. ft. house to help mankind with their generous donations?  Doesn't happen.  Geez, look at where Barbara big nose lives.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	I agree 100%, I have tuned out so many celebrities because of the way they use their celebrity status to promote their politics.  Susan Sarandon, Tim Robins, Woody Harrelson, Brad Pitt, and even Jen, I never thought I would dislike Jennifer Aniston but if they and so many others like them are on the TV I turn the channel or turn it off.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	I think they can support whoever they want. It won't stop me from seeing their movies. Example: I was irritated with Matt Damon for his Sarah Palin comments, but on the other hand I like Jason Bourne movies. Why would I deprive myself of entertainment because I don't agree with the actor's personal life?    I don't think much of him as a person though.    I also think its shameful for celebrities who abuse their power to try to convince those who are easily influenced on who to vote for. (Eg. Jessica Alba in the Will.i.am music video just chanting Obama...not even saying why anyone should vote for Barack). On the other hand, celebrities are useful for getting the candidates message across - and are a good outlet since people will listen. But I think they should know things before they tell people what to support or to vote for. (A good example is America Ferrera from Ugly Betty...when Clinton was running in the primary she went on CNN and ONLY talked issues and was well informed)|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	this all started with president clinton due to the amazing tax breaks he put through for the celebs. their taxes are next to nothing and nothing in comparisson to those who might make $500K a year as a CEO or anything - even though those CEO's employe a heck of a lot more people and heaven forbid - people are already screaming about how important those CEO's companies are.....  it's a sad state of affairs|`|BmIgpoPlaa	most of those hollywood folks are idiots that read cue cards.

If you look at this passed election, Obamas thoughts on distributing the wealth certainly makes me wonder if the stars knew who they were supporting.

I hope you give it some more thought and dig those CDs out of the trash, shrug your shoulders and say to yourself "OK, I like (whoever) in spite of the fact that he/she is a Democrat."

Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.

Something else that will play into it is that you need a security clearance to be a 31B, which means you have to have a clean past.

AA11163314	The plans to move the troops to Afghanistan predated Obama's administration by over nine months.    In fact, the November 2007 Al Queda decision to abandon Iraq and try to create a secure area on the Afghan/Pakistan border is one of the primary things that prompted our move.  (As the Marines put it -"We are leaving Iraq due to a lack of business.")    Another thing we are taking advantage of is the fact that those 2 civilians who are killed for every terrorist tend to be killed by the terrorists.  This has resulted in Al Queda and the Taliban being hated in the areas they try to operate and gives us a lot of cooperation from the local people.  (The Americans come in build a school and hire teachers, the Taliban come in and burn down the school - who do you think the locals are going to be upset with?)    And you need to get more up to date sources of information on the situation in Iraq.  I bet that you are not even aware of the Iraqi elections that are going to be held on the 31st.

Afghanistan is the main base of operations for Al Quida and if we pull out before stabilizing the government they will just come out of their hidey holes, declare victory over the great satan, and become a bigger threat than they were 10 years ago.|`|bR8u9hpbaa	Actually, the liberals never had a problem with Afghanistan, they believe that was a justified fight. They always had a problem with Iraq, but voted for it anyway, but when soldiers actually started to get killed in action they freaked and did a 180. Also, stop drinking the left wing cool aid. The more terrorists we kill now, the less of them we'll have to contend with later. This total bull crap about making them madder to they'll be more likely to do something again is nothing more than a scare tactic used by the left. America will always have enemies, no matter what we do, so get over that fact. Its always safer to be on the offensive than it is to be blindsided because we were complacent.|`|MntRFqtHaa	I find it stark raving made.   Up until Nov.

We know it's not the ones in Iraq, now they must go to another hell hole.    But they say, Now we can get bin laden, but any fool knows with his resources he can simply walk out of harm's way    Then when you point this out, they will tell you, but its to keep the taliban from taking control.    So do we stay there forever?  If this is what their people want, then who are we to butt in?  It won't work anyway.    More of our men and women will die, for what?|`|1f2d7c63654f19e2f84fe4695357337eaa	No I don't. I have a problem with how Bush bungled it from the beginning.  If he had actually focused on Afghanistan, instead of pulling all our tropps to go to Iraq for his little personal vendetta, this would be a moot point.  Afghanistan should not be an issue right now.    EDIT:  Thumbs down for stating facts - NICE!!   it is well known that we were undermanned and understaffed in Afghanistan.  Even the generals said so.

Does anyone here see the irony of Saudi Arabia demanding religious tolerance and laws against blasphemy while forbidding the practice of any religion except Islam in Saudi Arabia itself? The UN has become a useless, corrupt, discredited and morally bankrupt organisation. It should be disbanded and a new organisation called the Union of Democratic Nations formed to replace it. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Egypt should be barred from membership until they allow freedom, equality and dignity and religious toleration to all who live in those countries.

kMYE3vV8aa	No similarity between David Palmer and President Obama.  David Palmer was a good president and I hated when they killed off his character.  I do see similarities between Wayne Palmer (the 2nd Palmer president on 24) and Obama.  Wayne was wimpy and couldn't take a tough stand and wanted to be everyone's friend...      I like the new President Taylor so far.  She seems pretty no nonsense too and in the midst of losing her son and maybe her husband, she is still standing her ground and not giving in to what the polls and her entourage tell her.    I think President Obama needs to hire "Presidents" David Palmer and Taylor as advisors... or maybe just the 24 writers would be helpful! :-)    Good, fun question!|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	David Palmer was likeable.

Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person.

ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.

During Boot Camp, the entire second phase is dedicated to combat skills for all Marines.  Next, all Marines go to Marine Combat Training, with the exception of Infantry Marines, which further teaches combat fighting skills and weapon familiarization.     While I concur that we, in the Army do have better gear overall, I will not lend credence to the Army being more well trained than the Marines as it's just not true.  As far as the two compared in the Infantry realm, well it's about dead on the same for the most part.  Again, the Army having the blank check for gear definately helps in this area.      Don't let pride get in the way of intelligence and education on a subject.  Make no mistake, I've corrected more than one Marine on here for the same prideful mistakes when comparing the services.|`|G6yyceAxaa	I chose the army, at first It was just about which recruiter showed up, but after I learned about all the branches and what they do, I was glad I chose the army.  I scored very well on my asvab, but chose airborne infantry.  I was a recruiter, and really found out what was going on with the differant branches.for instance:    more women join the navy and airforce because they think it is easier  every country has marines, but they call them "naval infantry"  the 82nd airborne is the only forced entry task force in the military. (marines can't do forced entry in land locked countries)  overall the army was the best choice for me, maybe not for everybody, but I loved it.    note: I have to admit that the marine corp does better weapons training, those guys get orders to go to the range and fire at 500 M targets!  (trained with them)|`|UXOegnWvaa	I've been in both the Marines, and the army, and I would have to say the Marines were the best. Training was harder, our weapons qualifications were at much longer ranges than army, and our field training was mission specific, urban warfare, raids, amphibious landings and the like.  As far as rangers go, there were 3 prior service rangers in my basic training class..one quit basic in the first 3 weeks, the other 2 graduated boot camp and failed out of infantry school .  They send more soldiers because it takes 4 soldiers to do what 1 Marine can do.  Just joking there the numbers are based off of force sizes.  If there are half a million active duty soldiers and only 150,000 active Marines, of course theres going to be more soldiers overseas.  The reason members of other Branch's go to the army for things like airborne school is logistics and budgeting.  Why should the navy have its own school and the Marines have its own, when they can be combined and ran all at one location.  The only training courses that are not combined are branch specific courses.  Marines and Army use different infantry tactics so need individual schools for example.  As far as Army combatives..that's a knock off of the Marine Corps desigined Marine Corps Martial Arts program (McMap) and nowhere near as advanced.  After basic training all Marines go to MCT or Infantry school, MCT stands for Marine Combat Training and it is a condensed 2 week course to train all Marines as infantry.  As far as Special Forces go..each special unit is formed and trained based on a specific mission..Green Berets train and operate with foriegn fighters, they were formed to train Viatnamese troops and the mission hasnt changed much.  Marine Recons job is to get in, scout the beach landing sight or other invasion areas and get intelegence for follow on Marine forces, Seals come from the UDT's whose job was to clear beach obsticals before the landing forces hit, and Airforce special ops are designed to support the Air ops, combat controllers to guide the strikes, and PJ's to pick up the pilots if they go down.  I'm all for braggin on your branch, but before you knock someone elses, know something about them.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Which branch did you choose and why - The best branch?    That would be the Olive branch.  Because the other branches have so far proven totally ineffective at promoting world peace.|`|m5J36D28aa	I was faced with the draft that was going to send me to the front line in 'nam.  I joined the Air Force for the electronics training to repair avionics.  I worked in that field for 16 years after my 4 years of active duty.    I had no little boy desire to shoot weapons and learn a trade that wouldn't support me when I got out.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Marines    because I wanted to join the best trained branch with the most discpline    " we are better trained on our weapons"    I have to disagree with you there    " best fighting force in the world"    Again, I disagree    the number of army vs Marines being sent to fight has nothing to do with skill    The army has more members so they send more people is the only reason    and when it comes to special forces I would take a SEAL over either rangers or green berets.

Do it outside the republicans way of money grubbing "then all of a sudden to morons like Boehner" we are running out of paper & ink and the printing machine are broken etc.    However i do see our legal citizen majority being screwed by both major parties for decades NOW. We the people should have ended legally the reign of big money business & phony rep govt long ago and should still do it NOW!|`|AA11634870	Yes he has, he thinks if the stimulus package fails, our economic problems won't be thought of as coming from Republicans but from the efforts of Democrats to solve the problems.|`|VWLCwLNMaa	Globalism. You can't live with it.    Our industries have been trickled down to China. Now we have one way trade with China and the oil producing nations. We don't produce anything to export.    Trickle down economics during the age of globalism. Brilliant!    Say goodbye to the American middle class. They're already in the rear view mirror. And we're gonna miss them.      And that's the way it is.
WD6uLJxvaa	Exactly|`|aWRXK69Taa	it passed|`|q1GnMRxxaa	That's is exactly what I was thinking. So if this thing passes, the Dem's are to blame 100% when it fails. Obama needs to take a long look at what is wrong with it if he truly is a smart guy. Perhaps all the pork fat should be removed.|`|35ZJauLkaa	To share the blame of it's failure. He wants Republicans on board to provide cover for Dummycrats.|`|95gEZ22Caa	So for the next 8 years as the Republicans seem to know its wrong like in Iraq they just PONZI it big time then flush responsibility!!!    SWEET
z9UAnf3Waa	I think it proves just how wrong their "stimulus" package is.  And, how much it is all their own.  We are in for a long, hard ride down this rocky slope.  Hold on.  Stick together.  Be supported and support friends and family.  It will be getting worse instead of better.  Pray.|`|kTOJ9XYcaa	It proofs that the bill was partisan.  The opposition was only bipartisan.|`|95gEZ22Caa	And some voted against abortion too!!!!!|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	Folks, unless you, personally, are a member of the Incumbent Congress, we are all in the same boat: the one government is sinking.    We voters are real people, responsible for our actions. If we say we're a Democrat or a Republican, we mean it, I trust it, it's true.     BUT, when a leech whose been in Congress for 20 years, can't balance a checkbook, never has to pay for his/her kids' education, gets bailed out of every conundrum life throws and only keeps up appearances when on camera, I don't believe a word they say... LEAST of all when they claim to be "Democrat" or "Republican".     Once again, let's be crystal clear: Democrats face no threat from Republicans and Republicans face no threat from Democrats.     We, the People, have always had one common enemy: an unconstrained government.     And I've never seen one less constrained than in these last 20 years.    ...|`|38a6a271a6f3afff0a706e5aae1f9057aa	No..the vote passed.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	It passed, didnt it?    I just think Obama spend too much time talking to Republicans...what a waste!|`|lPwdDpxgaa	It showed that they do not listen to their constituents by voting for the package.  Many moderate Dems (mostly the intelligent ones) and Independents DO NOT think the stimulus package was a good idea!|`|DR29KV1taa	Yes.  Adolf Obama is even losing support from people in his own party.  Hilarious!  I'm going to love watching Obama fall flat on his ugly face!|`|UXKMNkdgaa	It proved how partisan Nancy is. She did not even try to compromise. At least Obama pretended to listen to the Republicans.|`|RPeqzomsaa	it still passed. I was listening to talk radio yesterday and they were spinning it as a victory for the republicans, since they all voted no. Hopefully it will get shot down in the Senate.|`|64SObnr5aa	No of course not.    This is the first significant piece of legislation to be worked on.  The repugs as well as the dems are not going to give much at this stage of the game.  They are jockeying for power along partisan lines with a few hold outs.    It was a forgone conclusion anyway that despite Obama reaching across the isle that bipartisanship would not be happening.  Give it sometime    The people want action, not divisive politics and I am sure the congress it getting an earful from worried voters.  Look for more cooperation in the future.    Peace  Jim    .|`|m1HVh5YUaa	There are already splits within that party regarding the politicians and their constituents. This will become more apparent soon as the divide grows deeper until those who don't already realize it, will see that their party (and the Republican Party as well) has been infiltrated by factions whose agenda has nothing to do with America and the protection of it.    There are Democrats that still believe in Jeffersonian ideals, which may differ from the "Hamiltonians" but they are still both part of the American fabric, and the quest to create a society that is balanced with individual freedom and the protection of this ideal.    After all the effort over time that people tried to create the "America" that was supposed to be, the younger generations have been taken hold of by a nationless group of people that have convinced huge numbers of them to give up on those ideals. They are cynical and they act exhausted of the evils of the world when most haven't even experienced them. They seem as if they are putting their fingers in their ears so as not to listen and just yelling out to the government to handle it all, because they can't. It's truly pathetic and sinister.     So my point is, there are Democrats who believe in the Bill of Rights, they believe in their gun rights and they speak out against the censorship that this party seems prone to.     If people would just focus on the Constitution, specifically, the Bill of Rights, then both parties can weed out these cancerous creeps that have invaded our political system.|`|gSwobfujaa	no...|`|SPsYrJJEaa	It proved that all but 11 are thieves.!!  Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|9oKmNTFDaa	NO You must have it mixed up|`|yvPA8FSsaa	It does not show the Democrats to be powerless it just shows that there are at least 11 that still have integrity.  These are your classic "Blue Dog Democrats".  They are fiscally responsible and put the well being of their constituents and country ahead of Party.  It takes courage and they deserve our respect.    Believe me, there are a lot more Democrat Congressmen who wanted to vote against this bill but were too afraid to go against their Party.  This Bill is a bad idea.    *|`|MNZ8iqFqaa	It proves they don't listen to the people they we're elected to represent!|`|DBIKou8faa	No, it didn't, but I was glad to see that there may be hope for our country if those Democrats continue to vote their conscience.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	They used their common sense and voted for what will help America get out of our economic mess.    You are amazed because for the last 8 year the congressmen in power DID NOT use their common sense ... you're just not used to it!
RtHq6y78aa	NO    I neither support Obama or his mission to destroy Amerika.|`|gsKfSkJ1aa	Obama's mission is neosocialism and the advancement of liberalism.

Are you Rush Limbaugh?    lol....how UNamerican of you.|`|9tQSBMAQaa	I do not support Obama, as I believe he is too inexperienced to do the job.  I also do not approve of his liberal ways.

I do not support Obama or his policies.  One and the same.|`|um87XJvmaa	He is our president and I hope that he does well for all Americans.  I do not have an crystal ball nor am I an expert in any field, so I have no idea if any of his plans will work.  But, for the sake of all of us, I wish that Congress will work together and make the changes that America needs.|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	Not me but the Military does. They won't defy their oath, but like Bill Clinton the majority hate Obama.   I remember when Clinton was President and he shook the hands of the military, they did not smile at him, but did their duty at his command, and I remember when Bush shook their hands, they smiled, and even joked with him. You could see the happiness in their eyes.  If the men and women in uniform could choose to support Obama or not, most of them would not, but we know they don't have a choice. Their oath means something to them, and Obama's oath is already broken.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	I support neither  he's a super liberal with a super liberal mission|`|wdBY1fWaaa	I don't support Obama. I guess just like liberals didn't support Bush.|`|DR29KV1taa	I do not support Adolf Obama nor his National Socialist mission.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	I want him to do a good job, but so far, he is disappointing me big time.

Give me a break....|`|A7qDWyTYaa	I support the USA, so therefor the president, at least in times of dire trouble. Country before party !|`|eKtEWrcmaa	I don't support either because Obama is his mission. If he succeeds then his mission does and I think his plans are dangerous for our country.     I do respect the office of the President though. Unlike many liberals who showed extreme disrespect for Bush during his presidency I won't attack our current President. I'll express my opposing views but I will not attack him or his family like so many did with Bush. It was a disgrace how people behaved.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	He is the President of the United States, and I support the office. I hope he can succeed, it would be crazy to hope he fails since that would impact us all.    Having said that, I don't see how he can succeed given that his socialist policies are all unconstitutional, and just plain wrong for the country.    We don't need more pork, unless it is the kind on a farm, and being exported to third world countries.|`|145c8348c6805dffd8ad539dedd6effbaa	I support both.  The conservitives have already shown us what they can do.|`|36uns5nRaa	I support neither.    Leave Rush Limbaugh alone! He makes more sense than Obama! How come millions of dollars were spent on the inauguration when the economy is this way? Obama sure doesn't seem to have a problem with it!    This country is going to turn socialist at this rate!|`|1f944e23d84bc1ff43ee93ad66a40f2eaa	During the campaign I was suspicious of what his mission really was. But now, after his inauguration speech I feel confident I can support him. I think that whether or not you agree with a President, you should support him because hating him will only make things worse.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	No, he is NOT my president. You say "it's the american way" well, he's not an American. He's from Kenya and you people think that we should respect him? NO! Not when he's going to turn us into a police state, not when he's going to take away our guns in which we protect ourselves with, not when he's going to take away our freedom of speech, not when he's fine with killing innocent babies, there's so much that I can't even explain it all. Do I support him, HELL NO. He's an idiot and I can't believe that the american people are stupid enough not to see through him!
AA10329269	Any view point that differs or contradicts theirs.|`|IUw5Z395aa	A conscience, intellectual representatives, rule of law?|`|NhCECYuUaa	They definitely are afraid of science but they cover it very well by claiming conservatives are "religious" nuts and that, of course, means they couldn't possibly be scientifically literate.  But look at global warming, all of the science says it doesn't exist, but like the church and Galileo, if you criticize the theory, you are ostracized.    Tribeca-Dems ran a women 20 years ago because it was a desperate attempt to do something when they had no, absolutley no, chance of winning.  Reagan took 49 states that year (there are only 50, ya' know).      Obama aside, more blacks and women have risen to success in the Republican Party.

There need to be better protection of the general public from arcane financial concepts and practices.

Tax credits and rebate should be identified as dividends on federal wealth accrual.  Referencing the benefits of Industrial and Technical Economic growth with "Taxes" is an economic and  psychological control over Mainstream America by the "Leadership Class".

Most scientists agreed some time ago that we are in a period of warming, and Gore and others have been talking about it non-stop.  But theyre missing the point.      The issue is not whether the earth is warming (so is the planet Mars).  The question is the extent to which, if any, human activities are causing or contributing to it.  No scientist has said that is definitely the case.    I am in favor of reducing our carbon footprint.  I dont know if we are creating or contributing to warming, but if we clean up our act and reduce carbon emissions and later find that human activities are NOT a contributing factor, we will still benefit from cleaner air.    In Beijing and surrounding areas, which is heavily polluted, the incidence of lung and respiratory diseases has increased significantly in recent years.  And at the rate we are destroying our rain forests, we must be contributing to air pollution.|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	If Al Gore would shut his fat mouth so called global warming would stop dead in its tracks.

But don't blame the men and women who put there *** on the line every day for people who don't give a damn.|`|leqeslrFaa	Your statements are true. But it is the civilian populace not the Military that has grown weak.    I asked myself the same question. The nature of warfare has changed because the populace has become weak. The United States military could reduce Iraq and Afghanistan to glass craters but the War on Terror isn't recognized as a major threat as the Pacific Theater of WWII. Hence people would find such an act as a war crime or an extreme display of aggressive unnecessary force.    If you went to any other country fighting on two fronts, and another on the home front you would never see the prosperity that the American citizen enjoys. Reflect on history, like WW2 when a nation was conducting war all able bodied young men volunteered to for service. Civilians aided the war machine in factories and munitions yet today civilians live as if they are in peacetime.  Veterans aren't recognized nor rewarded for their service, and deserve greater appreciation of their sacrifice for your nation.    This also applies to my country (Australia) where anti-war perspectives have fostered almost a disrespect for our service men and women. The populace accepts the war yet once it is revealed the nature of war, ie killing and collateral damage, they immediately withdraw support when they only months they were ironically earlier displaying pride for 'fighting the good fight'.     Its just the nature of people, they're are duplicitous. They accept torture as long as they don't have to see images of it happening on their nightly news program. We have to accept it, you cannot change public opinion unless you control the mass media, and most media sources (at least in Aust) reflect negatively to the War on Terror.|`|rUry7fMnaa	Are you Military? Because last time I checked unless you were out there fighting in the wars our Country are in how do you know they have failed us?     You need to do your homework before posting stupid questions. First off the Military doesn't decide what we do as far as "dropping nukes, etc" the Commander in Chief makes those decisions and they slowly trickle down among the ranks. So, if you don't like the choices the Politicians are making, think about that when it is time to vote.     If you don't like the what the Military is doing take your ignorant butt out there and step in front of my husband or any of the other Soldiers out there who are risking there lives so you can post the stupid stuff you do.

"The safest place in Korea was right behind a platoon of MARINES. LORD, how they could fight!"  MAJ. GEN. FRANK LOWE, U.S. ARMY    Here's some more that say we can kick anyone's *** and smile doing it.    "The man who will go where his colors go without asking, who will fight a phantom foe in a jungle or a mountain range, and who will suffer and die; in the midst of incredible hardship, without complaint, is still what he has always been, from Imperial Rome to sceptered Britain to democratic America. He is the stuff of which legends are made. His pride is his colors and his regiment, his training hard and thorough and coldly realistic, to fit him for what he must face, and his obedience is to his orders. As a legionnaire, he held the gates of civilization for the classical world...today he is called United States Marine."  LTCOL FEHRENBACH, USA, in "This Kind of War"    "We have two companies of MARINES running all over this island and thousands of ARMY troops doing nothing!"  GEN.

You are having the same problem that even some military professionals are having. This is a war of small unit tactics where squad to platoon size units seek out a "Beyit Al Shuhada" (Martyrs' Houses) and kill or capture the "Hirabah" (terrorists) within. And we didn't "pay off" our enemies in Iraq. We engaged Sunni youth in Al Anbar and other provinces to become members of "Abna'a Al Iraq" (Sons of Iraq) to become a sort of neighborhood watch and report valuable intelligence regarding the Hirrabah and the location of those Beyit Al Shuhada.  And don't lay on the military the decisions made by the civilian leadership regarding their deployment and employment. Take those complaints to those who create those policies.

Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|liJKE5B2aa	They are both equally Jewish.|`|DBIKou8faa	They are both fine, as comedians.

5d9pCmjyaa	Trying to be objective here.  Although their policies proved disasterous that does not mean that any other policy will be successful.  In fact, there is very little relevance between differing policies.    The stimulous package really does have a problem with it in that most of the jobs it creates won't be created this year.  That puts the most effective stimulation policies it contains in a time frame when the economy is already expected to start recovering anyway.    The economy needs job creatin now, not 12 to 18 months from now.  But simply telling companies not to lay people off does not work.  Nor will giving them money convince them not to lay anyone off.  This particular problem nees two solutions.  1. Govt. becomes the lender for businesses struggling to get a loan.  2. Govt. puts in lots and lots of orders for goods and services.  They can do this in two ways - tax rebates for those who would actually purchase something with it (not just paying off debt or investing it), or by placing orders for all sorts of things themselves (what they do with is is not as important as the demand for goods and services itself).    This is why war is so good for business; it creates a huge demand for goods like tanks, jeeps, bombs, aircraft, etc. while it effectively destroys the goods once they are received - perpetuating demand.    But I do not advocate war as a solution.  I would prefer it be applied to civil use such as reconstrucing the infrastructure.  But in reality, it does not matter what happens to the goods and services as long as they are consumed.  That's the important part - that they are consumed.    Personally, I think everyone should be given up to 6K of tax rebates contingent on them spending it on some goods or service this year.   Essentially, you tell the Govt what you want, and it bankrolls it for you. That way, all of the money will go towards stimulating the economy.  Servicing debt and investing it does not create demand.|`|SSLekPAnaa	They are trying not to increase the federal deficit. There isn't one economist that has said Obama's stimulus plan will work.

BJERgbM5aa	Your spirit and enthusiasm is commendable.  BUT, you have to keep in mind one important fact:  The Corps has it own timetable for everything, including future officers and future office candidates.  You're doing everything right.  Your best course of action now is to keep your college scores high.  Why?  Because plenty of people are facing a bad economy and are turning to the military for work.  As a result, there are more applications, enlisted and officer.  So for the first time in a long time, the military has it's pick of the best.  So they raised their applicant standards.  And in your case, the Corps has raised the officer candidate standards in academics.  You have to maintain high percentile ratings.

However, with the introduction of the Human Rights Act in 1998, capital punishment for any crime was outlawed (except, interestingly enough, in times of war):    Part 3, Article 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998: "Abolition of the death penalty     The death penalty shall be abolished. No one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed.    Article 2     Death penalty in time of war     A State may make provision in its law for the death penalty in respect of acts committed in time of war or of imminent threat of war; such penalty shall be applied only in the instances laid down in the law and in accordance with its provisions. The State shall communicate to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe the relevant provisions of that law."    But in the UK I don't think there are any such provisions for the death penalty to be introduced during a time of war.

Our only salvation is that every other country on earth prints more money as fast as we do, at some point I predict a "bank holiday" where all banks are closed, to allow their books, loans and policies AND safety deposit boxes reviewed, precious metals confiscated and replaced with government script, just like FDR did in 1933. Then once they have the gold and silver coins controlled they will destroy or sell as needed to boost their currency above that of some other nation. This is why guys like Soros put so much money into "environmental" challenges to new gold mine development in places such as Romania. Ebay profits are from the coin trade. In Russia the people have been putting their money into durable goods and canned or other long shelf life foods, expecting devaluation like ten years ago, and that the Kremlin will again freeze bank accounts.

As long as Israel illegally (UN decision) occupies the west bank and Gaza they are the aggressors no matter how many times the US vetoes the truth.    And this history goes back further. In 2002, after the Israeli military assault on the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank that left dozens of civilians dead, the UN Security Council agreed to send a fact-finding delegation to investigate the dire conditions in the camp and report back to the Council. Israel was consulted and agreed to facilitate the visit, but then began to backtrack, imposing more and more stringent restrictions on the composition, leadership, and access of the team. The UN acquiesced to virtually every demand, but soon Israel reneged on its agreement altogether. Israeli officials told U.S. reporters at the time that they "preferred the short-term cost in world opinion of resisting the United Nations to the long-term risk of possibly exposing the army to war-crimes trials." The UN monitors, then cooling their heels in Geneva, were withdrawn.    This pattern of exclusion and suppression of human rights monitors and defenders reflects a clear goal of preventing international knowledge and understanding of  and thus accountability for  the harsh realities of Israel's military occupation.    Israel's recent decision, made by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to deny entry to the Special Rapporteur of the UN, represents a grave assault on the legitimacy of the United Nations itself. Ironically, Falk's exclusion also closely mirrors the November 24th decision by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who refused to allow entry to a group of prominent international human rights notables, including South Africa's first lady Gra?a Machel, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, and former President Jimmy Carter, a deplorable decision rightly criticized by many of Israel's supporters. But in a broad sense, Israel's decision to bar Richard Falk from the occupied territories, which have languished under Israeli control for more than 40 years, portends even more serious consequences than that of Zimbabwe because Special Rapporteurs for Human Rights represent the UN. So when Richard Falk was exhaustively searched, his papers painstakingly examined, and he was held incommunicado in a small detention room in the Tel Aviv airport used for those accused of entering Israel illegally, it was as if the United Nations itself was detained.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	it's all Israel's fault - they must have MADE them hit the launch button.  it's never the fauly of hammas.

SPsYrJJEaa	Here it is.  Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	No he never promised tax CUTS.     he only said that current tax rates would NOT increase.

BTW - so far, NO checks are being sent out to anyone.  Maybe at tax time next year, those who don't pay taxes will get some 'wealth re-distribution', but there won't be checks to stimulate the economy like last year (which didn't work anyway) but people thought they'd at least be getting something.

"Mr. Obamas signature tax cut would provide a credit of up to $500 for individuals and $1,000 for couples.

Student loans are no longer dischargeable in any chapter of bankruptcy unless you can prove that repaying the loan creates an undue hardship on you or your family.   Prior law allowed their discharge once they had been in pay status for 7 years.  The law changed in the fall of 1998.    Proving hardship usually requires showing that you can't provide a minimum standard of living for yourself and your dependents if you have to repay the loan.  Some courts will discharge part of the loan on a showing that repaying it all would be a hardship.     Student loans are sometimes unenforceable due to school closures, fraud, etc.  Chapter 13 can provide a way to cure defaults on student loans, or to pay them off over the course of the plan.    Looks like she could of filed for bankruptcy prior to 1998 and had it discharged easily.  With Obama as president it is likely Congress will make changes to bankruptcy law, but most talk has been of changing rules regarding homes instead of student loans.  But its possible the law could change on student loan issues.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	The interest will just keep accumulating and her tax refunds (if any) will be garnished.

Give me a break.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	Tax cuts are publicity stunts, designed to fool people into thinking they have more money than they really do, in the hope that they go out and spend this money.      Of course they don't benefit anyone. If taxes were not cut, everyone would benefit, by the sheer increase in money available for the government to spend on its next crack-pot scheme. And as you say, if they're going to cut anyone's taxes, it should be those who really need it - the poor. But I suppose if they kept the tax prices of the rich really high, they'd all bugger off and pay no taxes at all.

Folks, unless you, personally, are a member of the Incumbent Congress, we are all in the same boat: the one government is sinking.    We voters are real people, responsible for our actions. If we say we're a Democrat or a Republican, we mean it, I trust it, it's true.     BUT, when a leech whose been in Congress for 20 years, can't balance a checkbook, never has to pay for his/her kids' education, gets bailed out of every conundrum life throws and only keeps up appearances when on camera, I don't believe a word they say... LEAST of all when they claim to be "Democrat" or "Republican".     Once again, let's be crystal clear: Democrats face no threat from Republicans and Republicans face no threat from Democrats.     We, the People, have always had one common enemy: an unconstrained government.     And I've never seen one less constrained than in these last 20 years.    ...|`|m1HVh5YUaa	Edna, you have nothing to do with making this country stronger (for the PEOPLE).

I admit that your kind is empowered now, both supporting their parties.

Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas.

I'm sure the majority of dems are baby killers|`|K8Ca1sU3aa	Your question is utterly ridiculous.     Where is your evidence that only conservatives are rapists?    BTW    Your link does not prove that ONLY conservatives are rapists.  Republican politicians are ALSO NOT the "only" politicians that commit rape.    You have provided NO PROOF that the "majority" of half the population of our country (conservatives) are rapists. That's ludicrous!!! It's not true, so DEAL WITH IT!!!|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	What makes you think all child rapists are "conservatives"?  That is very disingenuous of you.  Both choices are bad.

Thank you Captain Generality for including me in the mix.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I don't, I call him the President poser!|`|AA10283080	I called Bush "Walker Bush" in an answer I gave yesterday because of the questioner not using the President's first name and got all sorts of thumbs down and insults for it....no surprise considering the people the insults came from.    They think it's a clever way of insulting the President when in fact is just shows their pettiness.|`|j6GVLXgDaa	I don't point that out, because liberals get mad easily|`|97VqHCIRaa	For those who say "well the Democrats called Bush "W":    Bush was called W to distinguish him from his father. Infact, when he returned to Texas last week, they had a parade with people carrying "W's".    "W" is a term of endearment from those in Texas.    However, calling him Hussein, is an attempt to make him sound like the big bad wolf... its pathetic and demeaning.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	I don't, but it is his name. George W. Bush was called W all the time.|`|AA11016526	Because they do not like it his middle name which is stupid no one has control of what their parents name them and if you are happy with your name do change for ANYONE grow UP!!!|`|2oO36b0maa	Repeat- did you call him Dubya??  Get used  to it.  Anyway, I don't call him that but don't try to   tell us that we have to say President when  alot of Dems never called Bush that.  I  still just say Obama sometimes.  And @Silk, will people get over the race issue?|`|MntRFqtHaa	UHHH  Maybe because its his name?   Do you have a problem with his name?  I don't.  I just want to make sure people don't forget who they elected.  got it?

yS0hSFdOaa	No it does not.  These so called "Christians" are FULL OF IT.|`|2564ebc136b77a929f696fad679511c4aa	No. The New Testament, which Christians are bound to follow, does not condone revenge.    Christians are under the new dispensation of the New Testament. Jesus says this about revenge in Matthew 5:3839: 'You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I tell you, do not resist an evil person.'|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Does the bible condone revenge?    No.      2) if not, then why do "christian" conservatives say that they will complain about obama because libs complained about bush?  Additional Details    Goobers.      3) Sway: Saying I'm going to "do this" because someone else "did that" IS REVENGE!    Probably correct.  It also might be a lesson learned, though.  I agree with you that it is revenge - but, *conceivably*, the thinking could be "well, it worked for the liberals, maybe it will work for us"...      Jim, http://www.bible-reviews. com|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	You can't use the Bible to make a point if you don't believe what it says and       I F   you believed what it said you wouldn't  KILL BABIES !|`|YK772H0saa	You can't exactly expect politicians to live 100% by the Bible.

We can try, but we'll fail.    Democrats are equally as biased as the Republicans|`|WD6uLJxvaa	thats not revenge, its stating opinion, this world would be really boring if everyone thought and felt the same way.

It was a different time.    The New Testament is completely different....here's what Jesus said:    You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.   Matthew 5:38-42, NIV|`|DBIKou8faa	Human nature and the Bible often conflict with each other.
81e525d2b0af9f7090cd857fd7b2095baa	You can make an obstacle course out of your surroundings.  Everyone runs in a straight line and the person in the very front decides what to do.  You can jump over benches and climb over walls, run up and down bleachers in a snake pattern.  Do something funny like run past a payphone and pick it up and say, "hello?"  Stupid things like that make PT fun.    Follow the leader, you know?|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	I'm just going to tell you that I really hated units that would PT like that when I was in.  You're in the military, heaven forbid you do an actual run.|`|tQfDaUnCaa	Im going to tell you worst you are at running the least fun it is. my suggestion is to run on your off time to better your self so morning PT doesnt seem so hard. I started training and running 1/2 marathons on my off time. Now I can out run just about everyone in my unit. Its kind of fun watching some of the people suffer on runs when I havent even started breathing hard. Being in the Army your going to run no matter how much you hate it, You might as well be good at it. Good luck|`|iOys3vneaa	i used to be in a small unit, and we did lots of different things before they got lame...dot drills are excellent cardio drills, suicides can be fun if there is some incentive involved, relays are a good idea provided the distance is great enough to provide some struggle...it really depends on the fitness level of your unit. sprints mixed with some muscle failure is awesome (like lightpole to lightpole or any other marker you have where you are). i personally liked circuits/grass drills because you get some cardio and some muscle work at the same time. there are websites for this kind of thing...unfortunately i dont know any off the top of my head but the key is to focus on the fitness first and make sure fun is  2 (the other way around can get complicated and ineffective).|`|LWzrCu5caa	I always found running with girls work.   There is no way I would let a girl beat me in running!    If it is a close girl friend,  the showers after the run are also pretty fun...|`|q0q79Inyaa	use water and make it a water bomb running thing go in a circle maybe protecting one guy from water and ppl can only travel in one direction like musical chairs so they get some fun and maybe you can even just play it like cat and mouse where 2 people chase each others back  just make the circle big so they run alot|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Everyone always wants prizes.  And they will run for them.  But you have to be creative in what the prizes are because of course no one has any money for those things.  If you do have some booster funds that can be used, then you can add something like movie tickets or a pizza.    You can set jars at various places on your course.  They will be racing to get to the jars but not all jars have a prize.  Some will just have an encouragement phrase on the slip.  Some prizes can be a prime parking spot (our commander even gave his up at times), a free errand run during the day, extra time for lunch, and a Friday where they can wear civilian clothes (approved first).  You could think of more along these lines.    That gives some incentive to run fast and keep going through the whole course.

L6w8YmoOaa	LOL no ur not really or legally married!|`|AA11206283	You have nothing based on taxes unless you live in a state with a common law marriage and it probably takes a lot more than just a tax return to legitimize a common law marriage.    You can't do anything based on what you are telling us except PRAY the IRS doesn't audit you.    Take your returns and your boyfriend to a lawyer. NOW>|`|DZzBfzVeaa	NO this does not mean you are legally married at all in any way. All this means is that your a doing some illegal things with your tax papers. its called tax fraud and you could be in some big trouble for doing this just to get extra money.|`|ucF2xy6Aaa	Um no you're not married and you are committing tax fraud by filing as married. If you want to be married and get the benefits of being married, you should actually get married.|`|AA11988604	no, and you need to amend your tax returns right away to file as single.  It's a serious offense to file a false return, and claiming you are married does not make it so, unless you live in a state where living together for x number of years makes you common law husband and wife.|`|AA11622716	Not all states recognize common law marriages at all.  In my state, there is no common law marriage.  In those that do, the requirements vary.  In general, you must live together for a specific period, usually several years, and more importantly, you must hold yourself out as being married.  That includes ALL social and business functions.  Filing taxes as married is a part of that (although it is usually the last part, not the first).  If you claimed to be married on the tax return but you hadn't yet met all the other requirements, you have filed a false return and could be in deep doo-doo.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	No its called fraud, and if you are audited you will be found guilty of tax evasion    it dioes not matter if you are getting married in about a month, you were not married at the time you filed your taxes, you have committed fraud and the government does not take it lightly when people cheat on their taxes. better get it fixed right away.    The longer the IRS takes to recognize the fraud, the MORE you could end up owing in back taxes, they add interest to that.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	Your not married, you just falsified federal documents, which could land you with huge fines or jail time.    And to think, all I had to do was file married, I could have saved all that money that I wasted on the wedding, lol!    Edit: ok, your getting married in a month. That would go under next year, when you file your 2009 taxes. Right now, your filing your 2008 taxes, which, during that year, you were not married. You can't file as married for a year that you are not married. I lived with my boyfriend, and owned a house together, and we still couldn't file as married until we filed for the year that we were actually married. Next year, at this time, when you file, (if you do get married), then you can file. Not yet.    I hope you haven't put the paperwork through yet, because it's going to get flagged (missing documents). Once it's flagged, they are going to ask you for the documents (your marriage certificate), which you can't produce. Get that thing corrected now, before you get in a world of trouble. You may think you beat the system by getting extra money, but in the long run, your going to have to pay all that back, with interest, and face an audit. You will have fines and charges brought against you. The guy at H&R doesn't care. He just wants to get paid, and many of them are only hired seasonally. If you don't believe us, call another H&R office, or any tax attorney, and ask them this quick question, they will all tell you the same thing. All of us can't be wrong.|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	ROFL.     NO RETARD.     Enjoy the knock on your door from the IRS for fraud.|`|a280cc1b0751df0fe9a3f19e7c0be347aa	You are not married, so why did you do your taxes together!?  you have no rights.  Better hope you do not get audited by the IRS, down the line.  It is no fun.|`|AsXK0xD5aa	if your are together 6 months then your common law married|`|PTTpVBWvaa	That does not mean you are married. You actually have to have the marriage licensed filled out and well certified before you are married. Without that I doubt you can change your last name at all to your boyfriends...That would def. be tax fraud. If I were you I would make some phone calls and do some apologizing, sorry!|`|nbibIzC5aa	Do you and your boyfriend live together and if so, for how long?  In some states, if you and a member of the opposite sex live as a couple together for a period determined by your state (Louisiana for example is 10 years) then you can be considered to have a common law marriage and are entitled to certain rights.      However, based on your statement, it sounds more like you committed tax fraud.  Fraud is the "intentional misrepresentation of material existing fact made by one person to another with knowledge of its falsity and for the purpose of including the other person to act, and upon which the other person relies with resulting injury or damage."  You and your boyfriend intentionally misrepresented yourselves as married with knowledge that it was false in order to include the government (the IRS) to act on your misrepresentation, which results in the loss of money (damages).      I recommend that when you receive this extra money from your taxes, to place it in a savings account.  Should you get audited or your fraud is discovered, your penalty will most likely involve the repayment of the money received.      Simply saying your married on a government form does not give you any legal rights that are connected with marriage.  A marriage license is needed in order for you to have any rights.     Just one more thing, you should contact H&R Block and ask if it is ok to say that you are married even though your W-2s state you are single.  Ask them to show you the rule in which it states that you have a right to file a claim as married even though legally you are not yet.  There maybe a rule that allows you to do so and if there is, ask them to show it to you.    Hope this helps.

nbibIzC5aa	You should definitely speak to an attorney about your situation.  It seems from your statement that you have at the very least a verbal agreement with this gentleman that in exchange for 35 dollars a month, he will provide your home with water.  If you think in terms of utility services that the state provide, they are required to provide you a service such as clean water as well as maintaining the equipment needed to bring the service to you and in exchange you pay your monthly bill.  If the state needs to fix the pipes, etc., then they may raise your rates to cover the cost.  The same is true in your case.  The gentleman offered or agreed to provide your home with water for a fee.  If he does not live up to his agreement then the solution would be either to correct the situation in order that he may fulfill his obligation or return the money paid because of inadequate service.      Hope this helps.|`|jlgfkyrEaa	I would drill your own well. the cost of this would be nominal somewhere around 2,000.00 to 4500.00 but the piece of mind and the increase in property value would far out way the stress of never knowing if you are going to have water.|`|AA11206283	Have a lawyer review the shared well agreement. You may have conditions that legally have to be met when the well is not working; as may he    Or drill.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Why cant you just get regular water not from a well? if a well is the only way you can get water then you must live way far out in the middle of nothing. if you cant aford to drill your own well then i suggest moving to a place where you have running water. Thats a little more important. And $35 is NOT cheap for water! There are 4 of us in our family and we pay about $12 a month for water. when i was living alone i paid about $4 a month for running water. So maybe we live in very diffrent areas, but you should definetly more or start buying bottled water at the store and using it for everything when your water goes out.

By the way don't expect a real answer from any of the partisan cons, they just feel like whining instead of giving a real answer to the questions.    The economic stimulus package proposed by Democratic House leaders totals $825 billion and includes three broad pieces: a $365.6 billion spending measure for such brick-and-mortar projects as highways and bridges; a $180 billion measure to boost jobless benefits and Medicaid, among other things; and a $275 billion tax-relief package, which includes a plan to give a $500 payroll tax holiday to all workers, a proposal from Mr. Obama's presidential campaign.|`|DR29KV1taa	It is going to expand the size of government and entitlement programs.

Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	It will pass eventually.

These checks are only recirculated money; it doesn't add one cent to the economy. Most of this money will be used to pay bills of credit cards that have already been used in the economy. Those who don't need it will simply stick it in the bank and not circulated it at all. History shows that only tax cuts across the board stimulate the economy and rebate checks aren't tax cuts. They are welfare checks to non taxpayers.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Toward a bunch of junk. $1 billion for Amtrak, $3 billion for Native Americans, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, $400 million for global warming research, $2 billion for carbon emission projects, $650 million for digital TV converter coupons.

gb9REJN4aa	I think that usually the way this works is your employer will give you days off equal to the days you spend traveling for work. So, instead of getting paid for a Sunday, you might get to take the next Monday off or the Friday after that (or another day in the week if you or he prefers). That's the normal way of things; usually, the day off is discussed before the business trip happens. If that's not possible because you are needed at the office, then yes, the employer should pay you for the day spent in transit.    Your employer is responsible for paying all your travel expenses: food, hotel room, rental car if necessary, etc. However, since it was your choice to come back on Sunday instead of Saturday, it is arguable whether you should pay that day's expenses. I'm not sure what the standard would be; very few employers, I think, would expect their employees to come home on 3 hours' rest. However, when the employee requests extra days, usually they pay for their own activities during those days. So I'm not quite sure what is fair or reasonable here.|`|EXuDqVvOaa	My employer pays hour 8 hours travel per day but after that its tuff titty.

AA12212403	I know someone who sits around watches TV, is on the Internet and buys all their stuff on the TV shopping network.  This person is probably about 400 pounds and is  on "entitlement".  This is a person who is a member of Mensa, so they sure are smart enough.  In fact, maybe smart enough to figure out how to get whatever they need from society and do nothing.  Sad, isn't it?  My thoughts, start walking, it doesn't cost money and you can lose weight and get a job like the rest of us.  She uses her weight as an excuse not to get a job like the rest of us, I think.  I hate that this person does absolutely nothing and we all pay for that.  You and I (the working people) pay for her mortgage, her upkeep and her medicaid or whatever it is she has.  Is it fair?  Why is she entitled?  If she can't find a job, make her work for the government, at least.  I'm sick to death of this.  What is worse, this woman is actually my cousin.  I have kindly suggested she, at least, try selling stuff on eBay to see if she could find some extra income.  But, she does absolutely nothing.  Make no mistake, there are legitimate people who have needs, handicapped and ill folks or those who have been laid of who need a hand and I do not begrudge a single one of those people.  I even lead a group that helps the homeless, I am not heartless at all.  But, what sickens me is those who take advantage and this new regime is going to foster this and make it worse.  When my husband was unemployed a few years ago he refused to apply for unemployment, though he was entitled.  He worked really, really hard and was too proud to accept aid.  We made it on our own, it was rough, but we did it.  He worked harder than anyone I've ever seen and started his own business.  Within 4 months, he was making as much as he made in his old job as a consultant and then someone hired him as they were so impressed by his diligence.  If you put your nose to the grindstone, you can do what you set out to do.  I am tired of freeloading.  If we work hard, we should get to keep our money.  We are not rich and taking more from people like us will prevent us from being able to save for retirement.  We are having a hard time and are putting two kids through college, cash, with no student loans.  We have worked so hard to do this, it's only fair we reap the benefits of what we have worked for.  If we are responsible and make our house payments and don't let things like, why should we pay for the homes of the irresponsible?  We are being taken advantage of and these people laugh all the way to the bank at us.  Sickening and totally wrong.|`|k6hicodfaa	Reagan era.

They lose power when we cut entitlements to the parasites of society.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	Just be thankful that you aren't mentally retarded or slow or that you weren't born with severe disabilities.    I've had several jobs and finally retired after having worked for one employer 32 years but I am tired of hearing from relatively healthy people who complain about people on welfare.  I considered myself lucky that I was born with intelligence and able to work when so many aren't.  Not everyone is blessed.    In Michigan, people on welfare who are able to work, must.  They might still be entitled (entitled simply means that you meet certain requirements) but their benefits are reduced.  If they don't work, they don't get checks.  But this applies to those who are able to work.    If you lose your job, can't find another one and your unemployment runs out you'd better hope that welfare will be there to help you in your time of need.  That's what it's there for.  And too many in our population are only one step away from financial disaster.  More and more families are homeless because of our high unemployment and it will only increase.    So please.  Try to be more understanding of those who are not as fortunate as you and I.  Not everyone has other sources of income to fall back on when they lose their jobs.|`|SPsYrJJEaa	Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|7MJSPGnhaa	welfare sounds so harsh, it's not tolerant and kumbaya enough.  People don't want to take responsibility for their poor choices so if you say "entitlement" it no longer means handout, it means getting what I deserve just for being born in this country.
QI74CxD0aa	Creating more government jobs just creates more overhead to drag the American economy down.    We need to create value for the economy.

Didn't Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr. create more government jobs by increasing the drug wars? Isn't that what right-wingers want to do by creating abortion bans? Someone has to enforce them.

AA11494150	If you mean can your testimony be used instead of showing up, the answer is generally no. One of the rights of the accused is to cross examine any witnesses.

XoAwzQ5Yaa	The castle doctrine is a great idea. If someone is breaking into your home, they are not doing it to be friendly. Most criminals who have the balls to do it while your home are pretty desperate, how do you know they wouldn't use deadly force on you? I think it's a great deterrent, and if anyone ever tried to get into my house, I would have no problem shooting them, coming or going. Then again, if they are dumb enough to miss the cruiser parked in the drive way, the K9 signs on it, and all over the house, chances are, they deserve to get shot by me (in law enforcement) or my husband (also in law enforcement). I would do anything I had to to keep my family and my daughter safe. With that said, I would make sure the sucker was dead before I called the police. Why?

There has been video of McCain speaking at an ACORN rally (and praising it lavishly) shown on tv several times.    This bus has left the station - why don't yu settle in and wait to see if Obama can pull another FDR and get us up and running again?

To me 6 months to a year is more than enough for maternity etc after that it's mandatory work for 2-3 years before you become eligible for assistance again.  Then you get into daycare etc, with all the daycare assistance the govt offers there's no reason for someone to say that they need to sit around and watch their child instead of working(unless that child has legit special needs).|`|abaad89210d63dec4904f2e85346439caa	I think if you aren't working towards a path to independence then you should be kicked off.

One party wants the business owners to be the rulers.   The other party wants their ivory tower elitist to take control of everything (including your money) and just dictate all of everything you do with your life. They gain power by convincing the stupid they are better off turning all their assets over to Big Brother and empowering the Government to do everything for them.   You pay a price for being a decent person. You can survive better in this nation by selling your soul to the Devil.   Neither Party follows the Constitution.|`|TvThS81Naa	i agree that it is flawed unfortunately i dont have useful ideas for you.

They can also get food stamps and financial aid for college.    I understand the hardship they go through but how about people who barely make over the minimum? I think it is unfair.I would like free food and financial aid. But that wont happen. Anyways just to let you in on a secrete life isnt fair! SUPRISE!    Also if law were to change and these people will be suffering. Could you imagine the economy?  People living in the streets, people not being able buy stuff such as food, or people not paying rent? That would just kill our already suffering economy. The reality is this unfairness will never end. =( So suck it up like me and keep working hard.|`|ECMoICWpaa	I agree.

Ry61ViNZaa	Look at places in this country that have passed laws to make the minimum wage much higher than the federal law.  Those places have much higher prices on goods and services and higher unemployment rates.    Business has only two choices when forced to pay higher wages and taxes, to raise prices or to lay people off.    And other than high school kids and people of diminished mental capacity, who exactly is actually working for minimum wage?|`|lgyPxg26aa	To answer your questions:    Yes, Yes, and Yes.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	yes|`|QI74CxD0aa	Yes, yes, yes.    But we cannot solve our crisis here by complaining about what other countries do or do not do.  We have a lot of work to be done here at home to rebuild our economy and reestablish trust.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	But different countries have different standards of life, and creating a one-world currency is tyrannical and sinister. That is the problem right now. If something happens in one country, it leaks into others. The solution is localization and people thinking instead of being blind consumers and voters.    If Americans keep buying crappy cheap products from China, then why would anyone change this? They will provide the least amount of quality, and I am referring to wages and working conditions as well, as consumers will allow. If people continue to lead unconscious lives, the results, no matter which way things are shifted, will be the same.    We can no longer trust or rely on governments and their inflation-crisis-currencies to provide anything but oppression, interference, and failure.    People have a choice to support a smaller company, and the few cents they pay extra will reflect their value system. People have got to quit going by government/banker value systems or it will always end up in a convenient "crisis". Government expands during "crisis". It is in their interest to expand and survive at any cost. How can they be trusted?

So I would not mind much if USPS doesn't either.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	i would prefer to eliminate tuesday services as they are also talking.  sadly not enough people use the postal system as once before. with on line bill paying and emailing instead of mailing letters -- it's becoming obsolete.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Yes|`|EPqnB7Epaa	I don't see any harm in that.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	No I wouldn't. Skipping a day could cause a good bit of trouble. It wouldn't just be bills that would be delayed a day on your end but on the end of companies also. I know people would raise hell if their payments didn't arrive in time due to one less day of delivery and they were given a late payment charge. Some also receive their paychecks in the mail. I'd be one of those people and there isn't an option to get it any other way. So a delay in service could mean a delay in getting my pay. For some that could be an extremely big deal.    But I hardly ever agree with the postal service. They have dwindling volume because of the rising costs. Instead of increasing the costs so frequently they should drop the costs. More people would be inclined to use their services and their profits would rise. The more they raise the prices the lower the volume will go.     They should also stop "lending" out the corrugated containers. The vast majority of them do not get returned and that is a lot of lost money.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	Yes.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Sure.|`|L6w8YmoOaa	If they do that I wont even use the post office to send my bills anymore, that would really tick me off.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	Yes, I would.|`|3M1R22zraa	Yes.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	The PO didn't say Saturday, but Tuesday.

I hope the taxpayer gets no tax checks and no tax breaks that are unrelated to specific consumption goals.

WrDGhduxaa	Whether they admit it or not all police profile.   It is their observations that allow them to find criminals.  If a car is driving erratically then they suspect the driver may be drunk, that is profiling.  If the car is missing a tail light that is a reason to stop the car, and if other problems are found they had probable cause for the stop.  If the car had a sticker that said " I am an illegal alien" do you think that would be cause to stop and ask the driver if he was in fact an illegal alien.  I have been hit by 3 different illegal aliens who did not have a license or insurance, I do not have any sympathy for drivers without licenses or insurance.|`|grBxTsK6aa	YOU said the driver was intoxicated...case closed.  Good job mr. officer.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Your question is confusing, and I'm not sure that you got your facts straight.      First off, being an "illegal", that is being in this country w/o proper residency, is nto a crime that a person can be arrested for by the police - realistically, thenumber of deportable aliens is too high for local law enforcement to pull of the streets.    Residency and national origin aren't really suspect classifications like race.  If there is no racial classification (which might link w/national origin) then there's no racial profiling.    "when he makes specific characteristic details about the illegal drivers appearance? "  What appearance?  That he appeared black or Asian?  Or that he appeared to be inebriated, or smoking pot, or looking nervously at the cop while jamming a screwdriver into the ignition?    "Not to mention the driver is intoxicated too, but the officer does not have actually evidence, he does have a suspicion though."  You're wrong - the observations that create suspicion can be evidence.  In a trial for DWI, an officer's observations of a person's state of inebriation are evidence that the driver was drunk.    "How can you explain the difference between racial profiling and criminal profiling?"    Is that question really that hard?  If your observations are based on a actions suggesting commission of a crime, then it's not racial profiling.  ("criminal profiling"!?).  If your suspicions depend completely on a person's race (black man driving an expensive car) when there is no reasonable appearance of a crime, that's racial profiling.|`|AA10329269	What?

But we Americans don't make much fuss about anything anymore.      The idea for bailing out the banks comes from the the learned opinion of those that follow Milton Friedman's opinion that the Great Depression was allowed to happen because Hoover failed to bail out the banks.  Friedman's free market concepts are the backbone of conservative economy---no regulation, government non-interference except in rare and extraordinary instances to prevent monopolies and keep the free market going.    But the banks have been long protected by Congress--so have the credit card companies so there is a big dis connect between the banks and the people---    And to be fair not all the bailout is going to lavish life styles.

SPsYrJJEaa	Yes and theft.!!  Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|A6q6Ravhaa	hate  came  way before obama  and  it  will get  worst|`|AcWMpmPwaa	1. neither     2. education    3. while this may or may not be a true statement, if that's the way they feel, this does not make them racist.    4. no, this is due to the uneducated    5. disagreeing with someone and/or his policies does not make someone a racist. the term racist is a generic term used at will by certain groups to stifle intelligent conversation. these people that use the term don't even know what the real definition is.|`|JjU6IdnDaa	1.  President Barack Obama is a strong statement regarding social progress in the US.  It is the diversity of ethnic origins who combine to make the historic election a reality.    2.  Media resources are better reporting information on "hate groups and hate crimes".   Bringing racial aberrations into mainstream consciousness facilitates legal and moral response.  Remember how many things "Jim Crow" construct warned would never come to pass?  There are no more "Colored" water fountains, restrooms, or seating areas.    3. The nation is fortunately greater than the negative "Jim Crow" racism that confines the illiterate and semi literate to negative illusions of reality.  There are some who still fight the Civil War in their own manner(s).  This will not impede or stop economic and social progress that enables many access to wealth or at least a substantial quality of life.    4.  White supremasists are limited in the intellectual knowledge of how race has been used via "Jim Crow" construct to maintain adverse tension between the heirs of emancipated African slaves and poor European immigrants.  This is the perfect political crime.  The wealthy elite capitalize and manage the accrued wealth while African Americans and European American immigrant families struggle against bigotry for access to crumbs.    5. "Perception Is Reality".   Heirs of European immigrants and Heirs of Emancipation provide a buffer for the elite by preoccuppying them self with fictitious struggles.  The elite can afford to pay whatever the cost of gasoline per gallon at any price.  There were no "Colored" or "White" gasoline stations to provide an economic advantage on the basis of race.   Mainstream America must pay careful attention to the machinations of the "Leadership Class".    Many government officials and corporate leaders continue to travel at the expense fo the Mainstream.  The "Leadership Class" protects itself before it conducts the business of the people.  In the "Bailouts" the corporate executives were protected with expedient haste.      There are even federal officials who suggest that the children and grandchildren of Mainstream Americans should be obligated to replace the fund that are distributed to corporate entities that will "NEVER" benefit parents, children, or grandchildren of Mainstream Americans.      The coffee is brewing.   "We The People" need to educate the Mainstream to the danger of the "Cool Aid" flavor.

62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	This hardly sounds like discrimination or harassment to me. It sounds like a caseworker doing his/her job to determine whether or not your disability is complete and real. Try for a moment to understand the situation from your caseworker's point of view. S/he is required to document cases to a certain level in order to have a determination stand up to scrutiny. This takes some time and some cooperation on your part. Also, remember, you are not the only person on his/her caseload.     Even IF the SSA does have more lenient standards for older folks, that is not necessarily discrimination. It is perfectly logical to assume that a particular condition might be more disabling given the age of the person who has it. At least it is worth considering.    I have never had to deal with the SSA and can imagine it might be quite frustrating, but I also can understand the magnitude of the job they have to do to attempt to verify that people are not trying to defraud them.

I know of several people who have gotten there disability but it takes a while anywhere from 9 months to 4 years. You first need a medical doctor to say that you are disabled and not capable of doing gainful and substancial work. Then with your mental condition as well you would also need a phyciatrist to also say that you are unable to work.    Doing this on your own is a lot of stress and therefore can make it harder on your health. I suggest you get in touch with a SS diability attorney. They will evaluate your case and if they feel that you have a good case they will do the work for you and get paid when you finally receive your benefits.    The SSA will have to pay you back pay for the months since your original file date the attorney will only take 25% or a max of $5300.00    here is a source   Binder and Binder is the National Social Security Disability Advocates  www.binderandbinder.com|`|ivg0lRUraa	This is America!

The person who takes the disability application at the social security office is a claims rep or CR. The person who processes the case to a decision point at the state disability processing agency is called a disability examiner. Caseworkers are usually employed at mental health or at social services. I've been a social services caseworker and I've been a DDS (disability determination services) disability examiner.     If the person you are  referring to is a field office SSA claims rep, no you will not be allowed to switch to someone new. If the person you are referring to is a DDS examiner, you also will not be able to switch to someone new. However, the responses you got do not sound as though you were talking to either. Are you sure you haven't been speaking to a social services or mental health caseworker instead? I found over the years that many people get even this type of thing confused.    Also, I should point out that the blue book listings are not so simple. The reason disability examiners reach for their listing book about a dozen times a day is that the listings are confusing even for disability examiners with years of experience.    Good luck    If you want to research how the system works, try these sites:
CHn62CAlaa	Sure ... Then all the poor people could start hiring  and giving people jobs.|`|lqVpzxwjaa	yes|`|3yXhtBSxaa	Hell no.    You forgot to add "and the former middle class are below poverty level."|`|zuqv3qR1aa	hahaha...no way...you need rich people....you need the upper class to control business and pay the poor people....|`|j6GVLXgDaa	liberals love poor people....they like making more of them everyday|`|2CxfFENRaa	Less rich means less jobs.  Without the rich we wouldn't have a middle class.  The only way we can have a middle class without rich is if the Govt is taking care of everyone and making everyone equal.  Which we know never works for long  The more money circulating is a win win for everyone|`|Ljq25VEJaa	I would prefer it to say, "There are more rich people in the US."  Then I would agree his presidency was successful.  However, that will not be the headline.|`|AA10928202	If you're a communist maybe. Look at the great success of the Soviet Union.|`|2DahzSWvaa	A lot of the formerly rich have been committing suicide at an alarming rate recently. As for the headline I would be wondering what exactly that means. Does it mean the economy is even worse, or it means that the middle class is still striving?|`|oNg8zGi8aa	Under the US Constitution all Americans have the right to get rich . Not for government to make them all poor .|`|UY2MJtfGaa	Nope, it would be a disaster.  The "rich" are the ones that start the money rolling downhill.|`|97VqHCIRaa	Do you mean like it does right now?    No, I'll think about the disaster we are in right now and blame Bush.    I'm sure those people who are killing themselves because of being unemployed are a great sign of a job well done by the administration that has been in power for the last 8 years.|`|mGZCXPbTaa	I would have to read the article wouldn't I?  If there are fewer richer people in america then the money had to go somewhere.  Now if there are fewer rich people and nothing has changed other than that (the money went to other rich folk) then I would say No.  If less were in poverty, and we had an actual living wage...then a resounding YES.
ECMoICWpaa	No. It does not benefit the economy to raise taxes.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Obama said that at this time he was not going to repeal Bushes tax cuts, so I have to assume that the stimulus package does not repeal it. That is if Obama was telling the truth when he said that.
sM8PKUtoaa	This is a interesting one.  "The great empire" - could be the British Empire or even the Holy roman empire. But now, theres been a power shift.  Although thesy say obama is of kenya decent - its possible that still his ancesteros was slaves in kenya so he is 'the dark on from slaves come'.    And its a fact that the aryans - neo nazis, kkk etc are NOT HAPPY.    so yes, this could be a accurate prediction we are seeing now|`|20b5b2f60f6a8406fe22c4c87d801944aa	Write something vague enough and it can be interpreted to fit any event. If you look at biblical description of the antichrist, you could say that fits Obama too, a spell binding orator, a dark one, a man who promises a new way, to be a healer and peacemaker (I expect he can't resist the urge, as most non-military background Presidents prove, to play commander in chief at some point, ticking off China when they hold our financial debt and the Panama Canal bodes ill, the Presidents he compares himself too, Lincoln, Wilson, FDR, LBJ,  all are wartime Presidents, expect bigger adventurism than Carter's flop in Iran, or Clinton's misguided adventures in Bosnia and Mogadishu). No I don't believe he is the antichrist, the antichrist of John of Pathos was Nero, but maybe we have elected our own Nero, time will tell. If Obama sends US troops into Gaza, with the Russians in Syria, it sets up the end times prophecies for Armageddon, and all those who want that will encourage it.|`|xDPQ700baa	I predict the earth will continue to turn and the sun appear to rise tomorrow.    More validity there than nossy's claims.|`|M7GnRpd0aa	He also predicted that yellow men will rule the world, that could be interpreted as the Chinese economy. You can put any interpretation you like on his predictions.|`|77L2Ii9aaa	No.  Nostradamus is hogwash.  He made vague predictions that later people filled in the gaps to make them sound like he was right.|`|0PQRC8yraa	That sounds more like Muhammad Ali.    'the great one'    Cassius Clay      'float like a butterfly, sting like a bee'|`|Shp5riE6aa	I doubt he had Fox News back then.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	That was for George W Bush. We have been hearing the end is coming with every President since Reagan. Paaaalease, stop.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I think that those predictions can be interpreted to fit whatever the person wants them to.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	Nope.    Most of the stuff attributed to Nostradamus wasn't by him at all, and the stuff he did write had purely local significance - he was a jobbing astrologer. And the odd French/Latin rhymes he produced are so ambiguous they make the perfect Barnum statements, they could be applied to anything.    (And if you note, the 'great empire' can not be the US as it is barely two hundred years old, not four, and has not been all powerful for that long anyway!)|`|JO8YzDNVaa	I think that this describes Osar De LaHoya.    Seriously, if you put any stock in Nostradamus predictions you're too far gone already.    Read a newspaper from today, not what some guy read out of some chicken guts 2 thousand years ago.|`|b931753da53fa7c2b1a6ae8598d475b8aa	The Bible surely did|`|m0DgqEcjaa	I think there is too much hype around nostradamus!    How does that predict Obama?|`|44AkhdRnaa	No, Nostradamus predicted nothing.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Nostradamus has been wrong before. Plus what he wrote can be interpeted many different ways. Remember that the bible tells us not to listen to such people, but to follow God only.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	No! He predicted the fall of the most compassionate country ever to exist in the world
AA11494150	An officer only needs to identify himself prior to exercising his authority. Simply knocking on a door would not require it.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No, only if they are going to break in the door.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	No. But, at some point they do need to identify themselves.|`|AA11696297	no.  they can say it's the pizza delivery if they want.  or anything else.|`|u6ALw1gAaa	No but I always do.  If someone yells through the door and asks who it is I give them my first name.  It is the truth after all since I am in fact knocking on their door.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	depends.....almost all the time, yes    and your spelling is awful|`|rHhtn7plaa	depends on the incident  if you call 911 yes they say police deptment but if you did something wrong maybe not .
SHt3GoUAaa	Yea i went and enlisted in the navy about a week ago and they were saying the same things. I told them I used to have asthma, I smoked a lot of weed (only told them that because they were giving me a piss test and I had smoked a week before i went), and other stuff. They basically told me that none of that ever happened. They will do whatever it takes to get somebody to enlist. I don't know about the tests cause I'm not in and haven't been sworn in yet. But I wanted to say I had similar things happen when I saw a recruiter. Actually I thought it was funny and I personally didn't mind at all what they said to do.|`|HCKPDXhpaa	Well, those traffic tickets are minor things. they may pull it up but i doubt if it'll mean anything. If you have asthma I'd report that to the MEPS people. You could have an attack at basic and be kicked out of the army and federally prosecuted. You recruiter will be reported for telling you to lie though. do the right thing. your life is in danger.|`|8C9yJ0Bwaa	What's done is done.    If you had asthma before the age of 12, than you have to nothing to worry about. If you believe that any of these things that you listed will affect your performance as a soldier, and perhaps endanger the lives of your team, than I wouldn't join.     I lied about having surgery with my ears several times (when I was younger) and I did that because I scored average/above average for my hearing test and I knew that I wouldn't be jeopardizing anyone's life.|`|PPKuHl9baa	The first mistake was listening to ANYTHING a recruiter had to say. It's your choice bub. ADHD, Anxiety, Depression - Gay, get over those. Bring them up later and tell them it just happened and they'll maybe help you out with that. No big deal.   Asthma however., that's a big one. If you have to carry an inhaler you will not be accepted. If it's just a little problem I would stick it out. I went through boot with some tiny heart palpitations but it wasn't really a problem,.it actually improved as I went because my general health improved. I became more fit and my body started to correct tiny problems within itself. So, it's your decision. Don't call MEPS and grow a sack and either lie about it or don't go at all.|`|d68e44306ccdb303c6ffb9339eea647eaa	I'm not sure I totally agree with the previous guy response but I do understand what he's trying to say. I think if you do feel guilty maybe you could call the local command chaplin and explain the situation? Get some tips from him? Maybe that could help clear the guilt?    As  the depression and anxiety, I believe that boot camp could help with that as it will teach you things like believing in yourself and depending on your instincts. You'd be surprised how that will help.        As for Asthma that's where I do agree with the guy before me.if you have to have an inhaler then it will probably not work out so well.

We need to remove all of the rewards & incentives for them to come here.  No more anchor babies.  No more housing.  No more welfare.  No more schooling at over $15,000 a year per kid.  No more medical except true emergencies.      Name any other crime that comes with its own government & business sanctioned benefits????  Imagine if we told people:  "Its against the law to shoplift BUT if you can get away with it for a few years and maybe pay a little penalty we'll give you amnesty.  And we'll give you taxpayer money for driving drunk because we couldn't be so mean as to not consider that you are only trying to have a little fun.  Or maybe we'd tell the child molesters that it's OK to rape children as long as they are trying to make a better life for themselves.    If we did those things we would have millions more criminals doing those things - JUST LIKE THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH ILLEGALS!!!|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	america was built by immigrants,LEGAL immigrants.  everyone made some valid points,in my opinion,but money equals power,and in turn equals political clout.greed and corruption go hand in hand.sooner or later the "little people"are going to get pissed,and like history has proven time,and time again they will "rise against"|`|5HYabirzaa	I don't think your plan will work if your interested in a plan that helps the US as a whole, and here's why:    If US companies can't hire them, they'll lose millions while trying to get the same amount of US Citizens to do the same work, at the same pace and work hours. Today's Americans have easier alternatives and we see this even during this recession. If they did find a few workers to replace the illegals, they would immediately demand higher wages, longer breaks, weekends and Holidays off, and in many companies, it is not feasible to make such drastic changes.    Granting them Amnesty is something the would benefit us all! This would mean that we would continue seeing the billions in taxes and the billions in purchases illegals make. It would mean that US companies would continue seeing huge profits, helping out the economy and keeping their prices low for us, the consumer. This would mean that Social Security and Medicare would stay afloat, and it would mean that we would have happy families that know they won't be torn apart.|`|JLayHNZCaa	When they are caught, put a tax on firms and people that employ them..... $100.00 per hour, per illegal, for all the hours worked.  Payable within thirty days or the owner is deported too.   Ten thousand dollar, nontaxable reward for turning in businesses that hire illegals.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	Not sure what you mean by "pro-illegal Guru", but I think Tom made some really good points.    I would vote for educating Americans on the positive contributions illegal immigrants make to this country, and then we wouldn't have all this hate and scapegoating. It would benefit the US as a whole!|`|otKIUViRaa	Yes I agree  It is not only big corporations who hire illegal immigrants, I have seen illegals in the south in nurseries and working on farms harvesting crops, I have seen them working for Adams home builders, building subdivisions.  It is up to citizens to report violations to immigrations when they see this happening. I reported one case to immigrations when I knew this was happening.  If enough people who are hiring these illegals spend time in jail this will slow down illegals who are coming into this country.  I also believe Mexico can help stop illegals if pressure is put on them by our government.

I guess that is why liberals do nothing of value in our economy and just complain and whine - because they are ignorant of how it really works.     Your assumptions are so wrong! I am a business Boss. Go to school. Get educated. Get a job. Start a business. Then try asking an intelligent business / economic question.|`|TxRRITveaa	because of "fairness". Barack spells it out right here. start watching at :45|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	Simply because they are a perverse and bull headed lot.  To be perverse is to be backwards.    They keep insisting on raising minimum wage as if this were truly an answer towards helping those who did not bother to capitalize on their education benefits.  They raise M.W. and in turn, I'm forced to raise the cost of my services.  We're based on a tiered/ seniority system.  The guy at the bottom is suddenly making within a few cents what the next guy up (who has been there longer ) is making.  Now, he insists on getting a raise to reflect his time in service to the company.  And on and on it goes.  Suddenly, there is no profit margin.  And, when M.W. went up, so too did the state and federal taxes, meaning it now is costing more to do business.  But we would rather blame the CEO and board members/owners for having claimed their fair share of the bounty.  To counter this, the workers band together and form labor unions.  They demand higher wages, less hours and greater benefits.  This too raises the cost of production and services.    What they failed to comprehend in all of their years of higher learning is that taxes and socialism goes directly contrary to what Jefferson was writing about in the Declaration of Independence.    You see in 1776, the economy in America (which was founded on the idea that a man could amass land and wealth -- only the aristocracy could do that in England) was so great that America was financially supporting England, not the other way around.  The colonists had already had enough of big government.  Big government can never answer the needs of the individual.  They wanted a local, representative government and were told no.  They wanted a seat in Parliament, again they were told no.  They wanted an audience with the King and guess what.  No.  I double dog dare you to call your state rep. and schedule an appointment with him.    So, when Jefferson wrote the DoI and he spoke of freedom, what he was actually referring to was money.  In his mind and those of the other founding fathers, those who have it are far more free and have a far greater selection in life from which to choose than those who have little or none.  Those who have little or no money then, are enslaved to their creditors.  They were serving the Kind due notice that they would no longer willingly be enslaved.  So when you think of social programs such as welfare realize they don't "Help," rather, they do little more than enslave those enrolled on them.|`|RPeqzomsaa	Don't bore a liberal with the facts. they want a government that "cares." and one that is "doing something."|`|UY2MJtfGaa	Because for a taxpayer to keep more of his money means loss of control by Democrats.  The more the Democrats can take from you, the more they can control you.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	Liberals believe economics is a zero sum solution...that there is only a finite amount of money.... Your "examples" show that... Your first "point" is purely hyperbole as it doesn't take in to account that in group "A" costs of goods would be set at a higher level than for group "B" since the average income would support that... everyone would be pooorer for it.  Now your second point, you imply that a employer would cut the pay of his employees  or leave it the same... an employer who did that would be an idiot... his employees would leave and he would go out of business.    More than likely the tax Cut would allow the employer to hire MORE people for MORE production increasing his profit ... which in turn INCREASES tax revenue... it has EVERY time taxes have been cut... please take a little time and look at HISTORY before making absurd  claims.    Just one more thing about your first "point"... tax revenues in group "B" would be much higher than those from group "A".... those three millionaires would be paying 100% of the taxes for the goup and contribute significantly more than the whole of group "A"... ensuring that the entire group benefitted.  Cutting taxes on them would allow them to spend more and possibly bring up the rest of the group... but that is unlikely since in this country it is possible for ANYONE to raise to whatever level they want to and anyone content to be making 20K deserves it.|`|I4e8Hn3zaa	Money is POWER!

My kid was 7 years old.    She said, "Dad, you know when you get upset about something you say Bullpoop?"    She is not allowed to use "grownup" words, so poop was ok.  I said, "Yea?"  "Well, why don't you say, Bushpoop?"    Damn, gave her a hug and took her out for ice cream.    Wonder how many thumbs down I will get for that gem.

When the elections was going on.. me and my little sister (age 15) was in the car listening to a radio show.   They was talking about a incident of McCain reportedly calling his wife Cindy a "C **t".. but instead of "C **t" they used, the phase "The C-word".     I.. knowing what that meant.. didn't say anything for a minute.. then I told her..   "I really don't know why people get mad at a stupid word like that.. I have been called it a few times.. and it doesn't phase black women."    My little sister, age 15.. turn to me mad.. and said..  " You are better then me.. I would kill someone if the called me "Colored"..."    I almost crashed my car, laughing so hard... LOL.. I later explained to her that the C-word did not mean colored.. I didn't elaborate on the true meaning of it..lol..|`|97VqHCIRaa	My kids don't pay much attention to politics...     And your story about that 6 year old kid is b.s.    6 year olds don't talk like that unless they've been coached. They don't have an understanding of economics... and adults who tell their children to say things like that should be ashamed.    Politics are beyond kindergartners... feeding them negativity like that is abusive.     I would have never done that to my young children with Bush...|`|09aGRz8paa	mine thinks any old balding guy is john mccain.  i'm not trying to be mean or anything she really does.
wg78UkxFaa	The courts usually prefer to place the person on home arrest in the state where the charged occurred.  They would have the person stay in that state until they have satisfied the debt that is owed to that state.  It is easier for them to be able to monitor the person, to make sure that they have in fact paid their debt for what they have done.      Also another state may not want to incur charges for a crime that wasn't done with in their state.      It may be possible to get a change made with the help of a lawyer through the court system.  I would suggest that the person speak with a lawyer in a case such as this.    I hope that this helped you with your question.  God bless!|`|65G38NZAaa	Call you parole officer and ask him/her, normally i would say no but they may make an exception.|`|AA12109395	If you are currently on any type of Probation, Parole, or have charges pending, you will not be able to leave the State.

4IOPe5ziaa	Mister J has the definitive answer.  It's not so much the man, as it's the office of Vice Presidency that doesn't pay much mind to the sole Constitutional responsibility placed upon the person holding the office.      J.B. K is just plain wrong in his assessment of Vice President Joe Biden.  Biden has a habit of speaking without thinking, but their are plenty of Senate members who are not nearly as smart as Biden:  Larry ("I didn't try to solicit another man in an airport restroom, even though I admitted it under oath") Craig of Idaho comes to mind.|`|aIjX0S1uaa	dumbest person in the senate - Joe Biden|`|zH0h0Tr0aa	The Vice President.!~!|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	VP|`|AA10689763	VP  Joe Biden|`|35985e59ca68529733224255fd3dabc6aa	The Vice President of the United States.

Ogden, 22 U.S. 1 (1824),[1] was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the power to regulate interstate commerce was granted to Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.

In general, he can use force to make an arrest --on his own-- if he has cause to believe that someone has committed a felony.  I don't know if this use of force was to make an arrest or not.  If he can use force, he can only use that force that is necessary to make the arrest.  Again, I can't tell from just the few words that you use to describe what happened. I can tell you that a jury is going to be much more sympathetic to the good citizen than it is to the crook|`|AdIrjmV7aa	He can be sued but should take it to a jury trial.

NFiiIQcxaa	Each jurisdiction has different rules.  You should consider filing a complaint with the state bar about the attorney not being diligent on your case (if you believe that is what happened).    As far as the substitution notice, if I were you, I would contact the clerk of the court the case is in and tell them that you have discontinued your relationship with your previous attorney, and would like to drop the case and have it closed.  They will tell you what the procedure is.  You may have to file a "motion to dismiss", but the clerk will be able to tell you for sure.    Good luck.|`|ph4Htg02aa	Find a new one|`|plFkELGbaa	Get a new lawyer to finish anything that needs finishing, and file a complaint with the bar.

The British Army or the innocents of PIRA.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	It is a total waste of money, we are at the start of a deep recession and wasting this sort of money on murderers is an outrage. If Northern Ireland wanted to be independent of the Union every few years democratic elections were held and the people could have voted for Gerry Adams and been free of Britain, but as the overwhelming majority of people chose to be British the scum reigned a campaign of terror leaving nothing but death and destruction in their wake. It was all for nothing, Northern Ireland is still and always will be BRITISH. Personally I wish it wasn't, I'd rather Ireland was one Island nation. I don't want anything to do with them of their horrid little country. The Irish have been a problem since Roman times and I doubt they'll ever change.

4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	I'll tell you right off the bat, you need a four year degree before you can be commissioned as an officer.    For officers you can do NROTC, have them pay for you in college.  You can do the PLC program which you can get your training down while in college and become an officer once you get your degree.  You can also apply to a Naval academy.    For enlisted, you can go to college first and enlist.  You can enlist then go to college after your service. Then it'll be paid for by the GI Bill.  You can work for your degree while you're in the service, which they'll also pay for your education.  You can also go Reserves which can be good if you want to go to college but still be part of the service.    I'm personally doing the PLC program in college.    Best of luck to you.|`|z42u6Tbkaa	check out the Marine Reserves.

It does not matter if he is listed on the lease or not. That is between you and your landlord.

The cops most likely will not let you throw somebody on the street right away, but once you file a complaint, advising that person is not on the lease, that person will be given a certain amount of time to vacate the premises.   You will most likely have to go to court to get this done.|`|d7377b1848c2707c1c89c275b39a7fdaaa	call the police|`|EG1ssjJcaa	Even though he's not on the lease, he can't be kicked out right away.  You will still have to go through the eviction process or he could sue you for displacement (believe it).  I don't think you need to evict him though a court or anything, but mail a certified copy (yes even though he lives with you) of a letter of intent to evict and list your reasons in the letter and the date (after 30 days) that you want him out.  Since he will have to sign for the letter, he cannot claim he's never read it.    Then if he's not out when you say he should be, you can call the police.  Good luck|`|DZzBfzVeaa	If he is not on the lease then he does  not have to leagally pay rent, the two people that are on the lease have to pay rent so you need to be bugging them for the money. As far as the other guy that is not on the lease, he needs to be told to leave, if he refuses to leave you can call the police on him and he will be escorted out will all his stuff, if he is not on the lease and you dont want him there then you can put his stuff on the curb and the police will take him out because he is not breaking and entering, since he is not on the lease.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	You all gang up and say get out today.|`|AA10026200	Try calling Law Enforcement, this is after all a legal issue|`|WD6uLJxvaa	change the locks while he is gone and put his crap out front, that is of course if he wont leave after ebing told to leave.

If he thinks that is all that is going to happen to him he is kidding himself.

And your fiance is willing to risk his Marine career for another woman?   Sounds to me like he either is not all that serious about you or he is not serious about his Marine career and is using her as an excuse.

It's a bad move, especially since we're considered to be in a time of war. Superiors tend to frown upon someone skipping town just because they feel like it.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	NJP is non-judicial punishment....not something that he would want.  It will stay in his record for his entire career and it can lead him to being kicked out of the military.  If he is gone long enough to be AWOL, then deserter, he will go to federal prison when they get ahold of him (and they will).  If he has leave, then he should use that instead of getting his *** in a ringer for just taking off like he is planning on.  He cannot do a red cross message in this case either because it is not an immediate family member that is sick.  This is just an example of the sacrifices he committed himself to.  I certainly wouldn't be proud of being engaged to an moron like he apparently is!  Sorry.|`|R2XDlMqTaa	Non Judicial Punishment. only if he is gone for less than 30 days. after that he is declaired a deserter and would get a court martial. NJP he could receive restriction to base for 1-3 months and reduction in rank, and a fine(no fun). court martial we are talking a bad conduct discharge and jail time. neither is good nor a good career move. i would tell him to go back asap. he needs to learn you cant have everything you want in life..there are disapointments. he signed a contract( his word) he needs to own up to it. both my daughters were born while i was deployed, i asked to be home, they said no. i stayed and fulfilled my duty.   at the end of the day all a man has is his WORD, his WORD IS HIS BOND. if he cant do this he will fail in life. not to be to critical but its time for someone to grow up...good luck

Did you catch Pelosi trying to explain the gleeful benefits of the birth control plan in the stimulus package?  It was insanity.  She rambled on and soon became basically incoherent.

Ry61ViNZaa	Bigger government is not ever the answer to pulling us out of an economic slump.    People think that this is all just free money going to pay for these government jobs and pork projects.    I asked a question similar to this a couple minutes ago and was greeted with responses about how un-American I was because all of the poor people that are unemployed and how its great for the government to create jobs for them.    The entitlement mentality has run rampant in this nation for the last 40 years.

Lower tax rates and a reduction in the  burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth."    This is the Cato Institute's ad statement regarding how to fix the economy.  Which reforms are they backing that would accomplish this?  Whose tax rates would they lower?  How would they reduce the burden of government.  These all sound great to me; but, I can't seem to find specifics to these recommendations.      And, from what I can tell, the Congressional proponents of this bill, mainly the Democrats, tout FDR's spending program that they believed worked.|`|ulzWumWPaa	Large numbers of Real economic professionals plainly know this dem program is nothing but a pork stuffed govt expansion program, that at best (if every single possible job was created) won't get anything done until after 2010 and into 2012.

Wcjc8Au1aa	I'm a Libertarian.  We believe the government should stay out of most of the activities that it currently engages in.  As a very general rule, that means we disagree with Republicans when they try to regulate people's private behavior - what they can read and see on the Internet, whom they can have sex with, etc.,     and we disagree with Democrats when they try to regulate people's economic behavior - telling people whom they can hire or fire or work for, or what they can charge for a product or service, etc.    We disagree with both parties when they use our military to intervene in conflicts that pose no serious threat to our own security.|`|X4z3GqAeaa	Traditional Libertarians are more toward the ultra conservative side. Civil Libertarians are more toward the middle I believe.|`|R7Hexutqaa	Libertarians believe in the smallest possible government.  That means:  No Social Security  No Medicare  No Medicaid  No Public Education, No compulsory education  No public assistance for food, housing, jobs, medical care  No compulsory unemployment insurance  No compulsory workers compensation insurance   No regulation of business beyond what is necessary to insure interstate commerce - that means no environmental regulation, no product safety regulation, no financial/securities regulation  No laws governing employment practices (meaning no protections for discrimination, child labor, minimum wage, or right to collective bargaining)  No federal money for highways, airports, rail lines, or any other infrastructure  No federal standards to insure interoperability of technology or systems like the electrical grid or internet  No laws on morals - gambling, prostitution  No laws on drugs  No income tax (even though this is specifically in the constitution)    In short a Libertarian society would reduce the US to a third world polluted cesspool of uneducated, desperately poor masses with a few privileged elites enjoying life behind walled off compounds.  You could never look to your government to address problems or injustice.  And without the power of government to address problems collectively and address injustice with force of law, problems persist and injustice prevails.    We are a nation of laws, not men.  Libertarians would do away with almost all of the laws - leaving everyone at the mercy of powerful men (or women.|`|D0KZiRBbaa	I am a Libertarian and ran for Congress as one.      Libertarian ideals follow that of "traditional liberals" (in the 18th and 19th Century sense).  The ideals of our Founding Father's and intent of their ideals in the Constitution are what we see as our ideal.  Limited government, greater emphasis on personal liberty and freedom (and with that great freedom comes a GREATER responsibility).    Some things that you will hear that I can tell you are false is that we are isolationists/nationalists, don't want oversight in corporations or are not supporters of charity.  The facts are, we favor oversight through private entities (an example of a successful oversight group that is not part of the U.S. Govt. would be UL or Underwriters Laboratories...around since 1894).  We believe in charity and altruism, but NOT through govenment force or coercian.  As Bastiat said, that is "Legal Plunder".  Most Libertarians I know support the Austrian School of Economics as opposed to our governments following (as do both major parties) of the Keynesian economic philosophy.  Lastly, we are not isolationists as we believe in diplomacy and trade with ALL nations.  As a whole we believe in true Laissez Faire free trade.  We do not believe in subsidies for our workers, but we do not believe in restrictions with foreign workers.      We support the traditional intent of our Founding Fathers.  What is crazy is that the people like us who support the Constitution are labeled "fringe"?!  What does that tell you?|`|3FtC9D40aa	There are strong fiscal conservatives whom advocate a stable currency as being the backbone of any economy.     They are social liberals. That you are free to exercise your rights as long as doing so does no infringe upon the rights of others. They believe that rights are yours for the taking and that you shouldn't have to go to the government to ask permission. If you have to ask, then you really don't have a right do you?    Perception is a big issue with libertarian ideals. Some see would like to claim that libertarian ideals would somehow destoy social order when in fact the libertarian aim is to restore social order.     If the current social order is working soo well. Then why is there soo much chaos, discord, and unhappiness among the people.    So while libertarial ideals may seem odd. The fundamental question to ask yourself is: How have the ideals you are using now worked out so far? Not soo good right?|`|Ljq25VEJaa	In essence, if it isn't explicitly in the constitution, it doesn't belong in the federal government.

bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	A perspective from Christianity ... if you aren't Christian - I understand you do not view it this way, that is your choice.  The question asks a view point from scripture, therefore I comply......    Clearly it is conveyed in scripture here that BEFORE you are formed IN the WOMB - God know you - God refers to an individual as BEING before they are born.  Thus, this would show cause that according to Christian belief per scripture - one IS before BIRTH and a LIFE - making abortion to be murder.    He would likely call it irrelevant and no longer applies - being a story or say that he has to separate his faith from his job to serve the state.    The problem with this is that a Christian knows that ALL of God's word IS relevant and God says what he means and means what he says.  As to separating beliefs from state - what is right according to man's law doesn't mean it is right according to God's law.  A Christian follows the laws of God all the time and their life is built around it and they reflect their belief in their daily life.      So Obama may be going along with the laws of man, but I find it hard to see that he is going along with the laws of God.|`|MntRFqtHaa	I have no doubt he and many who 'claim' to follow God, can easily over look this and turn the other way.  The real question is, will the people wake up when he starts quoting scripture a little more to his heart.....      Sura (9:29) - "Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, (even if they are) of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued."|`|B5Y46XBoaa	I seriously doubt that Obama has any more of a fondness for quoting scripture than he has for studying it or even trying to understand it. He knows no more about the Bible than any of his Muslim brothers do and only cites the bits and pieces that suit his agenda. He may call himself a Christian but when he called Jesus Christ a liar he exposed himself to the world as anything but a Christian. And when he sang the Muslim call to prayer in Arabic before the press, he exposed himself as the Muslim he really is. So of course he supports abortion... abortion of any people not Muslim that is.|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	Obama's interpretation would be that the reference was to him personally as further evidence that he is, indeed, the anointed one.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	I think Obama bellieves in the Koran not the Holy Bible or in reality he believes he is God or above God, as his value of human life is non existant|`|YKPN1444aa	Jeremiah was a bullfrog...Was a good friend of mine.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Obama does not advocate abortion and no matter how many time that lie is told, the facts don't change.    Obama is pro-choice.    Root causes of pregnancy include incest, rape, coercion, ignorance, stupidity, social pressure, gang initiation and more.  Do you really think the government has the right to tell those women what to do?      As to your Q, I think his interpretation of Jeremiah 1:5, assuming you quoted it correctly, would be religious in nature and have little to do with abortion.    EDIT: Liberals get to pick and choose?

F5GyrdQfaa	Well, the US is not a democracy, which was viewed historically as a legitimized form of 'angry mob rule.' We were set up as a representative republic, and at first only land-owners were to be given the right to vote. We despise this idea today, viewing it as a means of 'rich white men' keeping power, but the founders believed that anyone who did not have a binding tie to the land of America could be easily swayed to cause the country damage.      A simple test based on the text of the Constitution would be acceptible, as long as it was based solely on that text and not on the 140000+ pages of law passed since 1785. It could be short, a mere 5 questions, the failing of 3 denies the competance to vote (a majority rules test). Here, I've even listed sample questions...multiple choice, of course:    1)  Powers not explicitely granted to the Federal Government are reserved for...         a) the states         b) the President         c) the United Nations         d) God, or Buddha, or Superman    2)  What are the Three Branches of Government?         a) Legislative, Presidential, Supreme Court         b) Legislative, Executive, Congressional         c) Executive, Legislative, Judicial         d) Judicial, Congressional, Barack Obama    3)  How long may persons serve in the Senate or House of Reps?         a) two terms of four years         b) four terms of six years         c) two terms of eight years         d) unlimited terms of six years    These are simple questions...as long as we teach school-children the Constitution, and should help keep our rights inalienable, instead of being subjected to the whims of each passing disaster.|`|pZmdGcf7aa	Of course it would be.

That way if there's a problem with the ID the voter has a chance to correct the problem and try again.    As for competency exams, first I want to see you implement competency exams for candidates.  Once that's in place we can talk about competency exams for voters.|`|mMFJrPbvaa	The only requirement to vote here in America is that you have to be a Citizen of the US and you can not be in prison.  If competency tests are required (which they should be just to live here in the US) then that would go against the Constitution.  After the competency test whats to stop them from saying only the wealthy can vote?  That`s why it will never happen.    The National ID wont work.  We already have a Social Security Number, which is required to vote.  When dead ppl "vote" their social security number is used as well.  Who`s to say that your Nat`l ID number wont be taken in the same way? the ID won't solve anything when there are ppl who want to do illegal things there will be ways around it.    doodiedoo:     They can't even count votes that have a hole punched under the candidates name (think Chads and Florida) nevermind trying to tally who agrees with what.  That would just cause the candidates to be very vague and broad in their campaigning, I`m sure there would be some overlap in areas.|`|1eb935e6100f32fd7c9a8bad9e9be568aa	Definitely.. we have one of th most corrupt systems in the world even tho we keep saying it is the best.

Obama Giving ACORN $5.2 Billion in Stimulus Funds  A rising chorus of GOP leaders are protesting that the blockbuster Democratic stimulus package would provide up to a whopping $5.2 billion for ACORN, the left-leaning nonprofit group under federal investigation for massive voter fraud.What if Barack Obamas most important radical connection has been hiding in plain sight all along? Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	Literature, Advertising and Marketing, Homework Help sometimes.

Not only does such create jobs, but, improved environment means lower healthcare costs and more worker productivity.

Raising taxes to force people to pay more for fossil fuels is going to hurt the economy and hurt poor and working class Americans (the ones Dimocrats represent). Obamba allowing CA to raise fuel standards will hurt an American auto industry that is on its death bed.    This foolishness displays the environmental fanaticism that is rampant in the Dimocrat party. I am an environmentalist, but during an economic crisis, you have to BACK OFF!  Spending 400 million $$$ for global warming research is a huge waste of money, as is a lot of the fluff in the House "economic stimulus bill."|`|AA11988604	Obama is trying to stimulate job growth by investing in the technology and infrastructure we need to combat global warming, gain energy independence and reduce ongoing operational costs for heating and cooling homes and buildings and moving people and goods from place to place.   The one thing that seems central to your question in that situation is "Is now the right time to increase costs in the short run, for long term economic and social gain?"    I think its an excellent and astute question.   It's cheaper in the short run to buy our products from china where they make them with cheap labor in plants that pollute far more than we would ever tolerate in the US.  so when people rail against the balance of trade, and demand we move manufacturing back into the us, they have to realize that along with the manufacturing comes higher costs and higher levels of pollution.    Pollution in china is a problem for us because some forms of pollution reach our environment, acid rain, global warming, etc.    Back in the 1970s, Gary Indiana was a manufacturing hub, they made a lot of steel as well as other heavily industrial, highly polluting processes.  when you drove from the upper midwest out to michigan or the northeast, you went down through chicago and then south to gary.  when you approached Gary, you had to roll up the windows and hope like hell there wasn't a traffic jam on the interstate, because the pollution was so thick.  There was low visibility and the acrid smoke hung in the air.    things have improved a lot since then, in terms of cleaner emissions from manufacturing processes.  but when you move manufacturing back to the US, you are going to move some level of pollution back here as well.    So, investing in green technologies is an important precursor to moving more manufacturing jobs back to the us.    So I think some of the green is longer term thinking, but there will be immediate jobs as well|`|tHyJ0GzLaa	no|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	It's the BEST idea in the whole world, actually.|`|LvVlkQhDaa	A good question and I think yes- many Industries have been out sourced and are not coming back, by spurring investment and and making the change now we create domestic industry and the jobs that will come with it as well reduce our dependence on foreign energy-|`|esuG2Tvvaa	Going green in the short term will definitely have some adverse effects on the economy, but in the long term it may lead to many positive effects, not only in the economy but standard of living in general through increase in jobs and innovation.    Fossil fuels and the old ways are a sunset industry, it has probably overstayed its welcome and going green has to be done sooner or later.     Perhaps if the economy doesn't simply crumble due to these policies, it would be a nice lesson that one should not put politics and conservative thinking above human rights, and the right for an advancement for a better future people deserve.|`|el9wtu9Uaa	Its certainly not a cheap turn around but if its what he thinks is important then I guess it is.|`|1SUew4gRaa	Yes this is a mistake.  We are foolishly throwing money at old, obsolete companies instead of new, innovative cutting edge ones.  This is a major no no in  the laws of globalization. Then on top of that we give the auto fools money to blow and then nobama is going to go and create stricter regulation against them. This cost them many millions of dollars for research and Development.    We should not give out money to begin with. But why would you hand money out and then turn around and make things harder for them.  It seems like your the only one with any sense. This circus is killing America, I cannot believe it.|`|AA12015829	actually, going green is a big help in this economic down turn.  Going green can save you money.  The small things that are free can even save you financially like turn the lights off when you walk out of the room.  Take shorter showers.  Then there are things that are a bit of money:  change bulbs to the florescent bulbs, even putting one in the light that is most used will save you and help the environment.
dJnRFpWWaa	They shouldn't be receiving any bonuses connected to earnings or the performance of their company's common stock. But you would have to look at the exact contract language, or you would have to require that in the case of TARP money injections that their acceptance of the money negated all bonuses that are not reasonable and calculated on lending operations.    These guys must be very happy about this "bad bank" development. Now that former SEC Chairman Cox has slithered off to some backwater, now is the time to unshackle the financial institutions from the insane mark-to-market SEC requirements and allow them to adopt one or more approved models by which to market the value of these asset-backed securities. Bank shareholders are the ones who should take it on the chin if mark-to-model doesn't work, but it will work because it has the same net effect of the "bad bank" concept without overpaying billions of taxpayer dollars for assets that will be turned around and sold for cents on the dollar back to the private sector.    Let the banks change their marks and sell these assets directly without the intervention of the American taxpayer. The SEC could have and should have made this accounting change two years ago, but a buffoon was running the show. That isn't the case now. Change mark-to-market to mark-to-an-approved-model and reinstate an uptick rule and announce "mission accomplished." If the banks fail after that, then you take them over and wipe out all shareholders. That threat might get the banks lending again, but if it doesn't then you let them fail and spend taxpayer money at that unavoidable point.    No bonuses if TARP funds are accepted except those connected to increased lending. No "bad bank." If these guys can't manage their banks, then they should be fired by their boards of directors and replaced by executives who can get the job done without $50 million Gulfstreams.|`|336a1f89fdd7352c0589d6b7f7ff2592aa	Its obviously not performance related, how on earth can they justify getting any bonus after the balls up they have made of the worlds economy, they wont be suffering like a lot people will, i think it gross and disgusting|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	I think the whole theory of bonuses as motivation (Theory X) has been blown out of the water, because obviously it is not getting the best performance out of them.

As for your other statements, Obama does not want to "waste" money.  He's trying to create jobs for people can actually earn a living.  And he certainly doesn't want to "kill" the middle class.

I think the stimulus package makes more sense that the 700 billion dollars for the selfish, greedy fat cats on wall street, banks, insurance companies, mortgage companies and the auto industry. The party of Rush Linbaugh had no problem with giving tax money to those in the banking industry but to spend money putting people to work to repair schools and bridges is something they are against.   We really need to cut way, way back on imports of every manufactured item to cause factories to be built in your own country. The GOP and Democrats seem to be against that. I smell a rat, NO I smell a bunch full of fat sewer rats.|`|AA10832820	Everything you have seen and will see in the near future is smoke and mirrors.. Obama is wearing many hats. Reality has many levels.    Also, there is no real differnce between most Democrats and most Republicans. They are labels meant to divide us further...like race, religion, sex, nationality, etc.    The truth of the matter is the Federal Reserve has been absorbed by the United States Treasury. Everything changed about the beginning of October. The United States is once again bankrupt. In 1933, the real criminal bankers managed to pull many rabbits out of many hats and even convinced the American people they had to turn in all gold to save the country. That year the U.S, Corporation declared bankruptcy. Our ''country'' pledged their assets, which are the American people and their future wage/labor. Everything we want has been paid for, but that is a different story.     When the stimulus package speaks of billions of dollars, one needs to know there is NO MONEY. Everything is digits. Real money is defined in our Constitution and is backed by gold and/or silver. Obama knows what most Americans do not know.    We are about to change our ''system.'' Many will be in shock. There is one playing field merging with another which will create an entirely new and better world. Information many have thought to be truly unbelievable will be released. This will be known as TRUTH. Preparations are now being made. Watch on MSNBC Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow. The TRUTH is leaking out.    Patrick Fitzgerald has been leading the way with thousands of indictments. Karl Rove, as was revealed yesterday (1-28-09), will be made to finally testify. War crime tribunals are to be held. Scott McClellan will testify against Bush. Everything about our current system is broken. The only alternative is something new...and it is NOT what has been called ''The New World Order'' as previously mentioned by G.H.W. Bush (Daddy Bush).    The current amount of the proposed stimulus package does not even come close to what is needed. No way can we pay for anything with no money! The entire world is failing because of the rapacious bankers and their minions. After the Senate confirmation of Eric Holder for Attorney General, we should see some turn of events. Even the media will begin to report the truth.     Be happy! Your day is coming if your heart is in the right place. There is much information out there. Just be careful to carefully discern the truth from the lies/disinformation. Hint: Lies are packed with fear. I urge everyone to search for their own TRUTH! Seek and you will find.    This information comes also from personal experience.

This stimulus package, however, is something I can not support as it is written - it is full of pork and special interest pork that does not help the immediate need.

What a frigging joke.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	I dont recall anyone bellering out Republicans being Racist yesterday?  And I have desk job with unlimited free time so I would have seen it.

I could care less what color the politician is, it's all about THE ISSUES.|`|IDDBdU6saa	This hasn't been the first time liberals have done a "vote our way or your racist" card.  In the past though it had to do with gay marriage not because they didn't support the president.

With Limbaugh, Hannity, Medved, O'Rielly, and Prager. I frequently listen to all of those show just to get a different perspective.     And every single time I hear people call in the most they have to say is racist. Especially during the elections. I heard more then one phone call saying "We can't vote for Obama because we're still looking for Osama."    "America is a white christian nation and we only want white christians running it."    And so on. Not to mention seeing republicans on a daily basis on Y!A openly say they won't vote for Obama, because he's black.     And not to mention that when Republicans couldn't find anything wrong with Obama they started making things up. "He's non-American, he's a muslim, a terrorist."    It all sounds like racism to me.|`|HobgsxXCaa	Don't be so hard on them, almost everyone is a Liberal until they get a job and a brain and stop relying on their mommy to wipe their nose and butt.

I haven't heard anyone say "ALL" republicans are racist. There are some who are racist, some who are not. The ones who say they don't want a "black president" and they want him dead because hes black ARE racist.  If you want to complain about people calling republicans names though, you aren't the only ones. People call us democrats names also. Like "baby killers" (even if we would never have abortions ourselves, we only support a woman's right to choose, etc.). We're called lazy people who don't get jobs. (when not all of us sit on our butts and do nothing.) We're told we hate our country and don't support our troops. etc.  You're not the only ones that get called names.|`|B1XT60WEaa	Do not think so- everyone I know called them smart.|`|97VqHCIRaa	Who called ALL Republicans racist?

Ry61ViNZaa	A major component of Obamas economic stimulus plan is to immediately create 500,000 government jobs.    How is creating a bigger government, a greater tax and deficit burden, a stimulus to the economy?    Wouldnt it be more beneficial to Main Street to lower taxes on individuals and the private sector so as to put spending money back in their pockets and thus creating real jobs and goods and services?

The problem with "going after salt" is that it's one meal.     If you eat salads and fruit the rest of the week, that one order of salt-laden chicken nuggets is really not that big a deal.

What an idiot.     Hey, maybe soon you'll see white house staff walking around with pants that are two sizes too big and hanging half way down their butts. Obama is going to come outside into the rose garden one day wearing ball cap ****** to the side and a large gold chain around his neck. Then he'll tell the associated press to "back up".|`|3eb0DIxGaa	And now you complain how he dresses? WTF. It IS his home and office. He IS the President.

mxDoggk0aa	Obama Is full of sh!t what can you say.|`|GNNh52OMaa	his sheep will continue to defend this guy no matter how much they were enthusiastic promoting his change BS!|`|iEjmCX98aa	You can't publicly preach "unity" and getting beyond race with a "post-racial politics" (and present yourself as the only available vehicle to lead us to this promised land) and then in private endorse for two decades someone who couldn't be more diametrically opposed to Obama's public rhetoric. Obama, as expected, has issued a denunciation. It will mitigate things but the damage is largely done. You can't erase 20 years of endorsing bigotry with a politically motivated statement.    This is just the latest example of Obama saying one thing, doing another. As we learn more about his record we learn how often his rhetoric doesn't match it. If Obama is who he says he is, a leader for change who deeply desires unity, he would have pulled aside Wright and given him one of his now famous "there is no white America, no black america, no Latino America, no Asian America. There is only a United States of America!" (the audacity of a man saying this on national television and using that to launch a presidential campaign while privately endorsing the exact opposite) and then left the church long ago. He isn't from a small village in Idaho. He is from the third largest city in the nation, a city of 3 million. He had numerous churches which did not have a racist at the helm to choose from. He didn't. This can only be because he either agreed with Wright's worldview or he simply doesn't have the courage, the leadership, to take a stand that would hurt him politically (Wright's standing in Chicago was a boon for Obama politically). Either way it is not what you expect from a president.     Make no mistake. He endorsed his words via his action of returning to the church again and again for two decades. If a candidate went to Klan rallies for two decades could they simply say "I personally oppose its views"? This is an extreme analogy, though. A more realistic one is of a politician attending such a church. We all know if anyone but St. Obama attended a church with a racist pastor they would be done. Notice you don't here of any other politician having a racist pastor. There is a reason for this. They aren't naive enough to open themselves to such an attack. Obama's poor judgment did. When a campaign is based on words voters have a right to know whether those words are practiced by that candidate. Increasingly we are learning Obama says one thing, does another.|`|u23sBafTaa	Yeah like his new limo, and he is telling cars makers they need cars that all get 35mph.

AA10182327	This stimulus bill is not going to create as many jobs as Obama thinks. It is a bill for the last 40 years the Democrats have not been able to pass a bill because of control in the House.   $650 Million for the DTV conversion on top of the millions already spent?  $600 million to buy new cars for the gov't?  Now Education is scheduled to get $66 billion. But this money is not targeted to help kids learn. It states in there "No recipient . . . shall use such funds to provide financial assistance to students to attend private elementary or secondary schools." Why not? This is crazy and going to hurt us as a country even more then Bush did.  Below was taken from a Wall Street Journal article. I suggest you read the article titled "A 40 Year Wish List" in Jan 28 edition.  "This is supposed to be a new era of bipartisanship, but this bill was written based on the wish list of every living -- or dead -- Democratic interest group. As Speaker Nancy Pelosi put it, "We won the election. We wrote the bill." So they did. Republicans should let them take all of the credit."  I agree with that last statement.  Is this the CHANGE that you want? I certainly don't.|`|lHJlwuqBaa	Obviously, only the "no" vote was bipartisan!  I do believe the final "no" vote was 166 Republicans and 11 Democrats.  The "yes" vote was strictly partisan!|`|AA10329269	Republicans voting "yes" would be abandoning their ideals and capitulating to the wants of Democrats. Forcing a group to agree with you is not bipartisanship.|`|B1XT60WEaa	The no vote was bipartisan- both Rep. and Dems voted no. Only Dems voted yes. Wake up Obama-america does not want it!|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Since only one party voted FOR it, naturally the vote against would be the most "bi-partisan".  Therefore, the Republicans garnered more bi-partisan support than Obama.|`|q1GnMRxxaa	I think the fact that 20 dems voted against it should put up a big old red flag for Obama. If he is a smart man, then he should ask himself What is wrong with my package? If he ignores it, then he is just like Pelosi.|`|QZicQ0kuaa	Who cares? The bill is a disaster, and it continues the policies of George Bush whether you believe it or not. The Democrats are planning on outspending the Republicans, and don't forget that they LOVE increasing taxes and never cut anything. Look at the Earmarks after all the talk about eliminating them. They only say what you want to hear and then do whatever they please. It's appalling how Nancy Pelosi said "deal with it, the voters have spoken" or something close to that. The voters don't want huge pork spending. She is an arrogant, Left Wing, idiot who thinks the government IS the solution to all our problems. The Democrats blocked reform at Fannie Mae, Barney Frank was in charge of the Financial Market oversight for 3 years and said everything was "fine" 2 years ago, and they get MORE power? The media and rhetoric drove this election.|`|1b91ce32a95b13a1e9f83fdedfcea4f9aa	Obama. Bill passed despite the typical Republican roadblocks and Republican ideals that drove our economy to this gutter low. Republican economics are rejected due to incompetence. These puds need to quit whining and start governing.|`|AA10302860	I know...Obama doesn't want to fail, but he should realize that all of the Republicans and 20 Democrats do...so, maybe he should fail on purpose...in the interests of bipartisanship!    Also though...I was just thinking...if I was a Republican congressman and I knew a decent bill was going to "pass anyway" I might just vote against it cause I figure all the stupid people who voted for me would want it that way.  You know, I want to get re-elected and stuff!!!|`|8rGZFBKOaa	That would be the NO, NO, Oh, baby NO vote.  Kudos to the dems who don't need to stoop to brown-nosing the new and "improved" pork it to the hilt administration.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	Republicans voting no means that they are aware of how the people feel about this stimulus package and if they want to be reelected in 2010 then they better take notice.  Every politician who votes for this 819 billion dollar package of pork will have their jobs on the line in the next couple of years.  The American voters are getting tired of the bs and changes will be made.      On another note, there's really no way to show bipartisanship on this.  It's stupid and it is a worthless piece of legislation that will sink this country.  You either vote for it because you want to support Obama, you vote for because you think it will really help or you vote against it because it is a bad plan with way too much money going to welfare and social programs (pork).

People are losing their jobs and houses at alarming rates.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	I think it will get a lot worse than we are being told but so far they are just reporting what is happening now.|`|IGbEZZlraa	Of course they are!      The media was telling us that we were in a recession way before we actually were. They used it as a Liberal scare tatict to get us to quit spending our money, which caused a halt in production, which caused a loss of jobs, hence the real cause of the recession. If people would just get out there and start spending money again then our economy would actually repair itself.    It is actually common sense!|`|6AgnCKCPaa	It doesn't really seem that bad to me but I live in a place that never experienced the past boons so our economy didn't have so far to fall..|`|VOccyg7daa	I haven't felt the pinch yet but they've got me worried.|`|AA11086243	well... they exaggerate everything.... drama sells...    so, you naturally have to assume they are "taking some liberties"    but, the NUMBERS which you can't fudge as easily aren't good... and many are getting near 25 year lows... Jimmy Carter numbers...    like unemployment... highest I've ever seen it... but I don't remember carter... that's not just drama... that's numbers... and it's not good...    but I don't think it's the end of the world though...|`|45u7BzCUaa	I think your'e right.

Paris Hilton hasn't done much lately.|`|BUI2nlUVaa	It's a self fulfilling prophecy.  If you keep talking about how bad the economy is the worse it will become because people stop spending and then the people who depend on them spending lose their jobs and so on on and so forth.  It is all inflated and fake...the entire economy is based on belief that something is worth something.  So when that belief wanes then we wind up in the mess we're in now.  And yes it's bad out there.|`|qcLP5j8zaa	We do not have to rely on the media, research is helpful, the economy is hurting, many out of work, many lost their home and some take their life ( a feeling of hopelessness) this did not happen overnight.

Our roads and bridges are in decay and have been, we didn't have the funds to fix them before the markets plummeted, and now things are way worse.    War wise, I think with action in Isreal going on, war is going to increase quickly and dramatically, all costing the U.S. a fortune.    World economy wise... China's economy is self-sufficent and growing fast.  In comparison our school system is horrible, hasn't kept up with ohter nations.    What do you think our future will be like?    We let in illegal immigrants cause our people were unwilling to bend to the will of the corporates.  Why didnt we get rid of them... cause everyone has been greedy as heck and all about self at the expense of everyone else.    Obama is in office now, and he has already given top jobs to the lobbyiests he said he wouldn't, whatever.    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;...    You know things are going to go bust when all the financial managers and economists believe that we can spend our way out of any economic downturns that come along, while giving out unsecured, no money down loans to everyone including those who don't have either jobs or assets.  Spend our way out of recessions by loaning as much cash as possible to those that can't pay it back.... lol... give me a break.|`|NGvYcbToaa	its not, we arent even close to a depression, the only thing that could cause a depression is gov't spending money. well they are. it will hit us in the back of the head one day|`|T8xc1suVaa	That is a large part of the problem.. The media in an effort to get rid of Bush and conservatives spent 8 years bashing a good economy till they killed consumer confidence.   second part was Bush spent and spent causing the drop of the dollar in the world market.   third part was the housing bust brought to us by the democrat supported freddie and fannie buying loans no company in their right minds would ever make but they had to.   http://www.topix.net/us/democrat/2008/09...

This is how bad it really is:    http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/de...    [Derivatives the new 'ticking bomb'  Buffett and Gross warn: $516 trillion bubble is a disaster waiting to happen]    [Wall Street didn't listen to Buffett. Derivatives grew into a massive bubble, from about $100 trillion to $516 trillion by 2007.]    [ To grasp how significant this five-fold bubble increase is, let's put that $516 trillion in the context of some other domestic and international monetary data:        *        U.S. annual gross domestic product is about $15 trillion      *        U.S. money supply is also about $15 trillion      *        Current proposed U.S. federal budget is $3 trillion      *        U.S. government's maximum legal debt is $9 trillion      *        U.S. mutual fund companies manage about $12 trillion      *        World's GDPs for all nations is approximately $50 trillion      *        Unfunded Social Security and Medicare benefits $50 trillion to $65 trillion      *        Total value of the world's real estate is estimated at about $75 trillion      *        Total value of world's stock and bond markets is more than $100 trillion      *        BIS valuation of world's derivatives back in 2002 was about $100 trillion      *        BIS 2007 valuation of the world's derivatives is now a whopping $516 trillion    Moreover, the folks at BIS tell me their estimate of $516 trillion only includes "transactions in which a major private dealer (bank) is involved on at least one side of the transaction," but doesn't include private deals between two "non-reporting entities." ]    Even Putin mentioned the problem a Davos:    [Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately, we have so far failed to comprehend the true scale of the ongoing crisis. But one thing is obvious: the extent of the recession and its scale will largely depend on specific high-precision measures, due to be charted by governments and business communities and on our coordinated and professional efforts.    In our opinion, we must first atone for the past and open our cards, so to speak.    This means we must assess the real situation and write off all hopeless debts and "bad" assets.    True, this will be an extremely painful and unpleasant process. Far from everyone can accept such measures, fearing for their capitalisation, bonuses or reputation. However, we would "conserve" and prolong the crisis, unless we clean up our balance sheets. I believe financial authorities must work out the required mechanism for writing off debts that corresponds to today's needs.    Second. Apart from cleaning up our balance sheets, it is high time we got rid of virtual money, exaggerated reports and dubious ratings. We must not harbour any illusions while assessing the state of the global economy and the real corporate standing, even if such assessments are made by major auditors and analysts.    In effect, our proposal implies that the audit, accounting and ratings system reform must be based on a reversion to the fundamental asset value concept. In other words, assessments of each individual business must be based on its ability to generate added value, rather than on subjective concepts. In our opinion, the economy of the future must become an economy of real values. How to achieve this is not so clear-cut. Let us think about it together.]    http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12331706...
r86wXV1Waa	halo laddie    its been a while since i was here for one of yours Captain.    though i think the Aussie captain was most likely being flippant and no really meaning this as a sexist. i must say when it comes to navy women in Australia wearing a bikini, well it might just turn my head. if the right ones wore the bikini. as there are some i would nae want to see dressed so  being a retired Military man with 25 years of service    have you seen what a lot of these service women look like. i have seen so many that make better men then the Men do. Scary.   eegads if you put some of those women in a bikini the desertion rate world escalate in all militarys.  caution is the word here    finally if my thoughts on this matter bare a resemblance to the reality, would the Australian navy or any other service anywhere no run the risk of a law suit for false advertising??|`|91916cdfcacbfc10a3cb8d35b35bb07daa	afraid not, the men would need to be wearing the bikinis i fear (i you get my drift)|`|LeK1tSQWaa	LOL, um NO PERV|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	And so he should be....      ... on the other hand though, a few young ladies in bikinis in Afghanistan, they're not used to seeing that sort of thing over there, may make them drop their guard.......|`|IWlPfk1raa	I would defiantly join|`|SkWzsnuxaa	I think if your Navy has to shut down for two months you better be willing to try anything!

That is wrong on so many levels - I think I'm going to be sick.  Even if it wasn't so sexist, the idea of female Sailors in bikinis is overwhelmingly disgusting.  and I do like women very much btw.
BfmV2KpUaa	Well that's nice. Not talking never got anybody anywhere.   UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers refusal to allow any negotiation with the IRA during the 1980's only prolonged the violence for another 16 years.

When I was walking the streets of Tehran, Iran, in the Summer of 1979; I could not count the number of familiar and unfamiliar Iranians who asked me what I thought about their Revolution.    They were ecstatic and overwhelmed with joy to finally be free from the Shah of Iran who employed secret policemen called Savak and who murdered  100s of thousands of Iranians in the name of the Shah of Iran and at will. But what happened?    There are double standards in this world. The Greatest Democracy ever opposed the efforts of the Iranians who wanted to have a Democracy, too. And Mr. Trilateral Commission--Jimmy Carter---did every thing he needed to do to turn Iran into our enemy--and he is so committed to peace in the Middle East, today?    I have to go to work. I do not have enough time to spare for this lengthy answer now. But these hostilities between the USA and Iran led to all of the troubles in the Middle East since November 4, 1979.|`|Wb27b3onaa	Not really. But with BO as president, the Iranians can take advantage of the US.

For the sake of peace, I call upon the Israeli government to stop it immediately" - Benjamin Netanyahu    "If I were an Arab leader, I would never sign an agreement with Israel. It is normal; we have taken their country. It is true God promised it to us, but how could that interest them? Our God is not theirs. There has been Anti Semitism, the Nazis, Hitler, Auschwitz, but was that their fault? They see but one thing: we have come and we have stolen their country. Why would they accept that?" - David Ben-Gurion|`|DIlNnjf8aa	The zionists are liars. They said before they would lift the blockade but didn't.

4IOPe5ziaa	He only has a chance to speak to the State Senate.  He really has no chance of keeping his hold on the governorship.  He has as much as admitted that by his words and deeds.    Poor guy: in the face of all that he's up against politically, his best chance of holding on to his office would have been to step aside temporarily.  Then, maybe the state legislature might have felt safe about waiting until the criminal charges had been properly validated and adjudicated before beginning the impeachment process.    Blagojevich has just made bad decision after decision, appearing guilty at every turn.

h1lDGNp4aa	It would depend upon that single, black mother.  If she encouraged education, perhaps but doubtful.  White "privilege" in his case was really nothing more than being raised by grandparents and a mother who believed that education was a necessity if you wanted to get anywhere.  And even tho his father didn't raise him, his father also had a college degree.  Obama went through college on scholarships, grants and loans..........just like almost everybody else except the rich.  Unfortunately, poor people (and I'm talking about all poor people) don't usually understand the value of an education and, if they do think about it, they probably think that college is an unattainable goal for them.|`|aIjX0S1uaa	r a c i s t -- how come the Yahoo censors are not pullin u out of this site -- guess they only look at my stuff|`|jBRAT3Nxaa	I know a guy who grew up in Compton.

On one hand, you have the Democrat Party.  They Control both houses of Congress and the White House.  They are implementing a philosophy of big, intrusive, controlling government.  On the other is the Republican Party.  They represent the opposite.  They represent limited government, self reliance and liberty.    Which do you think is more in line with the original intent of the Founding Fathers?  This is not about winning for ones team.  It is about the direction this country will be heading.

We as a country are being lead to the shearing pin in order to be fleeced. There are two entire generations behind me who have been taught and have learned how to use and abuse the system. They have an entitlement mentality. They think and desire a nanny state will be there for them with a safety net at every turn in their lives.     This country isn't completely there yet, controlling every aspect of a persons life. People are the captains of their own ship in life. The life they live is a direct result of the choices they make.

Everyone should just stop for a moment and breath.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	My husband and I are doing okay  We lost quite a bit of money in the stock market crash, and thankfully we were able to pull our money from the money market accounts RIGHT before the value went down.  Our house has been paid off for a while now, so that's not an issue.  We live well within our means, and have enough saved back to keep us going for a little while.      We had to make quite a few cutbacks on unnecessary things--music lessons, ballet classes, entertainment, things like that.    One of the biggest worries is making sure our three children are being properly provided for.  I have a daughter who has been very ill for the past several months and she needs two expensive medicines that aren't covered by our insurance.  That is the main reason why we made all the cutbacks in our lifestyle.    My husband's job was terminated last year after the crash, so that has caused a great deal of stress around our house.  Especially when you realize you have to go to the pharmacy and put out $700 dollars for medicine so your sick child doesn't wind up back in the hospital.    UGH.      G-d sends us blessings though.  I can't allow myself to complain too much.  It provides some comfort to know that we aren't the only ones in a tough spot right now.  No matter how bad things are for us, I remind our kids, and the hubby, and myself, that there are many people who aren't as blessed as we are.  We at least have a roof over our head and food on the table.|`|6ee8b8df4ec58a140006d364d199a258aa	I am unbiased, they both are terrible and are trying everything to ruin the dollar value.   How can 54% of Americans support this economic stimulus plan? 819B to create or SAVE 4M jobs. There is a big difference between saving 4M jobs and creating 4M jobs, a difference of 8M jobs. If you take 819B to create 4M jobs, that's over 200K per job. Nice work!  The press is a joke. Their reports are so biased. Have we lost faith in our own country? I have. The people will work harder, longer and for less. The government will spend more and more. Who do you think is going to pay for it? Yup, the people who pay taxes. Just remember when they tell you it is your duty to tighten you belt and work a bit harder so you can pay just a little more tax. Now they want to give refunds to people who don't even pay taxes. Duh!  Don't be fooled about how your cd's are doing. Yeah, you did not loose money like most who had 401K and other retirement plans in the market. Many lost 50% of their portfolio. Inflation will eat your profits.  Not many were smart enough to invest in gold. Unfortunately, people were taking more risk to keep up with inflation and to take advantage of the bull market. Ever hear how Degan Mcdowell and so many others just hate gold and how it's a terrible investment. It's always great to get financial advice from an art major. Ha ha!  Most will be beaten down by inflation over the next couple of decades.  This blame is because of our fiat currency system and the unlimited printing of money. I guess they think fight fire with fire will work. What a mess. I guess as long as we stupid Americans can fool the rest of the world it will work.

I believe it is a natural swing the economy takes roughly every thirty years.  I do believe it is made much worse when the media continually reports negative news.  That can have an affect even on people like ourselves who have not been affected by the economy.  A much faster recovery could take place if the news lightens up and the government does less to "fix" the problem.  History shows you cannot spend your way out of a recession.  Positive attitudes equals positive spending.|`|A7qDWyTYaa	If Bush were to go up there, he wouldn't jump.  He would be thrown off before he had a chance.

Obama has had an intimate and long-term association with the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (Acorn), the largest radical group in America. If I told you Obama had close ties with MoveOn.org or Code Pink, youd know what I was talking about. Acorn is at least as radical as these better-known groups, arguably more so. Yet because Acorn works locally, in carefully selected urban areas, its national profile is lower. Acorn likes it that way. And so, Id wager, does Barack Obama.  According to the law, registered voters must sign, print their name and list their address on petitions calling for a ballot initiative. It doesn't take a handwriting expert to see that many of these were filled out by the same person. (Also, see pages 30-42 and take note of the signatures  a bit odd to sign your last name first, isn't it.)      ACORN Is A Bad Seed  Somethings rotten in the state of New Mexico, and Ohio, and Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and Florida, and    ACORN says it is a community group, but it is really a multi-million-dollar, multinational conglomerate. Its political agenda is driven by a relative handful of anti-corporate activists. ACORN spends millions of dollars to promote economic policies (like raising the minimum wage), but has admitted that it doesn't always want to abide by them. ACORN advocates for workers' rights and runs two unions, but has in the past fought its own employees' efforts to form a union.     ACORN's history makes for pretty interesting reading. The Clinton Administration found that ACORN was misspending government grants designed to help counsel the poor. Although it seeks minimum wage increases in cities and states across the country -- ACORN sued the state of California to get out of paying its own employees the state minimum wage.     ACORN's practices have corrupted our political process as well. It has engaged in questionable election activities for yearsstretching back even to the organization's founding years in Arkansas. In recent years, as its political power has increased, so have instances of fraud.|`|peGArn5Faa	Um, Obama's ancestors weren't slaves.  His father is from Kenya.

Immigrant Households and Businesses Generate Billions. Immigrant households and businesses paid approximately $300 billion in federal, state, and local taxes: $165 billion in federal income taxes, $85 billion in state and local income taxes, and $50 billion in business taxes.    Immigrants Pay More in Taxes Than They Use in Services Over Their Lifetimes: Depending on skills and level of education, each immigrant pays, on average, between $20,000 and $80,000 more in taxes than he or she consumes in public benefits.     Immigrants' Relative Youth Contributes To Social Security's Health: Current levels of immigration will provide a net benefit to the Social Security system of nearly $450 billion in taxes paid over benefits received during the 2006-2030 period--and almost $4.4 trillion during the 2006-2080 period. This is because 75 percent of immigrants arrive in the US when they are in their prime working years (age 18 to 65).

AbzXA92laa	As a woman and a conservative, I support equal pay and certainly hope that this will help to end financial inequality. However the current laws don't seem to have changed the status quo much.    The problem is that there is a difference between what is on paper and what is practiced. Obama paid his female campaign staffers less than their male counter parts and had the fewest number of upper level female staffers of all political contenders.    I hope that it does equalize pay across the board in practice, but unless it strengthens the laws that are already in place, i don't see that as practical.|`|2CxfFENRaa	Considering that he only paid women on his campaign staff 83 cents on the 'male' dollar, and we already have a bill for this, Obama is still sexist|`|reeU4N0eaa	Does that mean that men will now be taking measurements at Victoria's Secret?

Are you referring to the Lily Ledbetter Act? She found out she had been discriminated by getting less pay and lower raises than her male counterparts in the same job for her entire career, and sued. The courts ruled that the statute of limitations was 180 days after they discriminated against her, whether she was aware of it or not. So basically, the current law said that if they could keep a woman from finding out for 180 days, the employer was home free. The new law extends the window that the victim has to sue.    And it wasn't today, it was on the 27th that he signed this bill.|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	Um,that's how it has always been    maybe you need to rea more than just the highlights  The high court said a person must file a claim of discrimination within 180 days of a company's initial decision to pay a worker less than it pays another worker doing the same job. Under the new bill, given final passage in Congress this week, every new discriminatory paycheck would extend the statute of limitations for another 180 days.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	This is one of those situations where it sounds great, but the devil's in the details.

The SCOTUS held that a person suing for gender discrimination could only sue if she/he discovered the discrimination within 180 days of initial employment.  The problem with that holding was that employers do not just tell employees how much money other employees are making; they try to keep this information secret.    The new law changes the statute of limitations on filing suit to read 180 days from the day the discrepancy was discovered, not 180 days from initial employment.  The new law expressly overruled a holding of the U.S. Supreme Court.  That's a HUGE difference.      Saying the new law will have no effect is simply wrong.|`|qjH3Tigbaa	REpublican answer...................GEEZ ALL PORK BARREL LAWS JUST GIVING MONEY AWAY AND A WASTE OF TIME!

It will increase the likelihood that employers will slowly lower the pay of men for the SOLE reason to equalize pay without regard to experience or good work habits of the men.    As a woman who works in a prominently male-occupation, this will hurt me rather than help me.  The reason there are so few women in my trade is not due to their gender but rather the mandatory overtime, hot and dirty working conditions and the fact that burns are common.  Lifting of up to 100 pounds is not uncommon and at times the tooling is 350 degrees.  Many women simply aren't interested.    Now, employers will be shy about hiring me because they're afraid that I'll sue them.  Great.  I already get paid well for my experience but now it's going to be harder for me to get in the door.  I'm more likely to be a liability to them.  Just great.  I'll be looking for another occupation.

Sending money back to their home countries.  -Stealing jobs  -Putting financial burden on Schools and hospitals.

And it is sad because the actual information is so prevelant that you don't understand... it doesn't work.    Folks.. Los Angeles has more illegal aliens in it than any other city in the United States.  And that would be by about four times more than any other place.    August Welfare Costs For LA County Released     Print      E-mail  Friday, 26 September 2008  Supervisor Antonovich breaks down the numbers.    http://www.hometownstation.com/local-new...    KHTS News    New statistics from the Department of Public Social Services reveal that illegal aliens and their families in Los Angeles County collected nearly $37 million in welfare and food stamp allocations, announced Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich.    In August, illegals collected over $19 million in welfare assistance and over $17 million in monthly food stamp allocations, for a projected annual cost of $432 million.  Nearly twenty five percent of all welfare and food stamps benefits is going directly to the children of illegal aliens.    Illegal immigration continues to have a devastating impact on Los Angeles County taxpayers, said Antonovich.   Annually, the cost of illegal immigration to Los Angeles County taxpayers exceeds one billion dollars, which includes $220 million for public safety, $400 million for healthcare, and $432 million in welfare allocations.  This does not include millions of dollars for education.  =====================    If we educate the Americans on the matter of how much illegal aliens contribute, they will be out of America, America on a rocket.    And the hate and violence.  You cannot bring anything that suggests there is any sort of systemic effort to provide hate and violence.  You pick up one here.. one there.  And while that is happening...  walla..    http://www.usillegalaliens.com/the_dark_...    If there were no illegal aliens.......    The lives of 12 U.S. citizens would be saved who otherwise would die a violent death at the hands of murderous illegal aliens each day.   Another 13 Americans would survive who are otherwise killed each day by uninsured drunk driving illegals.   There would be no one to smuggle across our southern border the heroin, marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamines, which plague the United States, reducing the U.S. supply of methamphetamines that day, by 80%.   Our hospital emergency rooms would not be flooded with everything from gunshot wounds, to anchor babies, to imported diseases, to hangnails, giving American citizens the day off from standing in line behind illegals.   Eight American children would not suffer the horror as victims of sex crimes.|`|qZ1wEDPpaa	Please.. Educate me.... I want to learn.. Because everything I have studied on the issue points to the negative.. Like your blogs up there.    See you can say that an illegal contributes 1.8 Trillion dollars all day long. However, I know that the money would have been made in America regardless. Had an American done it, there would be more money in the system as they tend not to send 25 billion a year dollars out of our economy every year... Now should I mention the added cost of educating illegal alien children at 10,000 a year.. Or the illegal immigrants that will be eligible for free health care with the passing of SCHIP... Or should we talk about the cost to incarcerate them?? Im sure you dont want to talk about the wage stagnation that they are bringing with them??|`|Yzb44aV6aa	I dont understand the whole illegal immigrant problem...i think that should be the least of your worries.

Bush should have avoided being so open (at least with enemies, Lord knows he was plenty closed with us).  Obama is far better at subtlety, getting across to his allies what he intends to do, while keeping things hidden enough so that enemies can't take advantage of any possible weaknesses.      Bush was an easy read, and he could be taken quite easily just by knowing how to play the game.  Diplomacy and war are like poker, and Bush always gave away his hand because of how open he was.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Hi imback_missme,  it's me, the favorite shill of truth activists on yahoo answers and your socialist buddy. Hope my answer sheds some light    I'm sorry to say the American people have very little to say about what their government does.    While employing democratic rhetoric to legitimize its rule within the United States and to justify its use of violence all over the world, the contemporary American state retains at its disposal repressive mechanisms of unparalleled scope: a prison system that, with more than two million people behind bars, is the largest in the world; a massive and heavily armed police force; a judicial system that processes over 14 million arrests annually and that has the power to inflict capital punishment; an immensely powerful and lavishly funded military force, imbued with militaristic and anti-democratic sentiments; and a vast national security apparatus, which has been given extraordinary latitude in spying on and prying into the private affairs of the people. Over all these institutions the American people exercise virtually no effective supervision or control. Torture has become state policy, habeas corpus has been drastically restricted, and the state operates, in addition to its public prisons within the United States, an international gulag network of secret prisons into which nameless individuals, deemed enemy combatants, are made to disappear.  Democratic rights established in an earlier historical period have been drastically eroded. Lincolns democratic vision of a government of the people, by the people, for the people has long since degenerated into rule of, by, and for the rich. The right to vote means little in a political process regimented by an institutionalized bipartisan two-party system that guarantees the monopolization of election campaigns by the two corporate-backed political parties. The existing electoral set-up excludes effective participation by parties opposed to the Democrats and Republicans. Ballot access laws have been designed to prevent challenges to the two-party dictatorship. Likewise, freedom of the press means little when the major media outlets are controlled by powerful corporate interests. Moreover, there are many indications that the Internet, which has created the possibility for alternative opinions to be heard, will be subjected to increasingly heavy-handed regulation.    Obamas breathtakingly rapid disavowal of his own campaign pledges expresses far more than his own dishonesty and cynicism. It reflects a deep crisis of American democracy. The existing institutions and political framework are impervious to the democratic expression of the popular will. Whether a Democrat or a Republican is in office does not impact the basic direction of government policy. The two-party system functions ever more crassly as the instrument through which the ruling financial oligarchy exercises its political power and controls the state. It flows from this essential political fact that the direction of the Obama administration will not be altered by popular pressure from the left, as claimed by the myriad left-liberal and petty-bourgeois protest organizations oriented to the Democratic Party. The end to war and inequality, and a settling of accounts with the crimes of American imperialism, cannot be realized within the framework of a degenerated capitalist-imperialist regime. What is required is not changethe hollow mantra of the Obama campaignbut social revolution.  If there is one salutary impact of Obamas election, it is that it will discredit the Democratic Party and its use of identity politics as a means of diverting attention from the class struggle and the oppressive and exploitative nature of capitalist society. The fight for social equality, which requires the unity of the working class, was replaced with the allocation of social privileges to small sections of various minority and/or oppressed groups. For decades, the proponents of American liberalism, backed by the various petty-bourgeois radical groups, have sought to elevate race, gender and sexual orientation as the essential categories of American society, while deliberately obscuring the significance of class. The rise of identity politics has coincided with a sharp move to the right by the Democratic Party. The promotion of affirmative action and similar policies has been accompanied, however, by deepening social inequality, including an enormous growth of social inequality within the black population. With the election of Obama, racial politics will be put to the test. The decisive social category in the United States and in every country remains class. And as class struggles erupt, they will sooner rather than later be directed against the new Obama government.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	Did you feel like you had an opinion when bush was in office?

Who was actually in charge? Dick Cheney, Richard Clarke, Norman Mineta and the 9/11 Commission directly conflict in their accounts of top-level response to the unfolding events, such that several (or all) of them must be lying.   2) Air Defense Failures  a. The US air defense system failed to follow standard procedures for responding to diverted passenger flights.   b. Timelines: The various responsible agencies - NORAD, FAA, Pentagon, USAF, as well as the 9/11 Commission - gave radically different explanations for the failure (in some cases upheld for years), such that several officials must have lied; but none were held accountable.   c. Was there an air defense standdown?    3) Pentagon Strike  How was it possible the Pentagon was hit 1 hour and 20 minutes after the attacks began? Why was there no response from Andrews Air Force Base, just 10 miles away and home to Air National Guard units charged with defending the skies above the nation''s capital? How did Hani Hanjour, a man who failed as a Cessna pilot on his first flight in a Boeing, execute a difficult aerobatic maneuver to strike the Pentagon? Why did the attack strike the just-renovated side, which was largely empty and opposite from the high command?     4) Wargames  a. US military and other authorities planned or actually rehearsed defensive response to all elements of the 9/11 scenario during the year prior to the attack - including multiple hijackings, suicide crashbombings, and a strike on the Pentagon.   b. The multiple military wargames planned long in advance and held on the morning of September 11th included scenarios of a domestic air crisis, a plane crashing into a government building, and a large-scale emergency in New York. If this was only an incredible series of coincidences, why did the official investigations avoid the issue? There is evidence that the wargames created confusion as to whether the unfolding events were "real world or exercise." Did wargames serve as the cover for air defense sabotage, and/or the execution of an "inside job"?|`|482oQASHaa	Taking the F Train to Times square to shop at Toys'R us|`|DR29KV1taa	It was a Tuesday morning.

The girls I watched decided to play a board game so I thought I'd watch the news for a bit and then I ended up watching Regis and Kelly. I went into the kitchen to check on the girls and when I came back, the show had cut over to the news. I thought it was an accident at first. Then I watched in horror as the second tower was hit. I was trying not to freak out because I didn't want to scare the kids but I was crying and in shock. I called my husband at work and told him to turn on the news, then I called my sister. Then I called my sons school and was told they were on lockdown. I watched what I could of the news, but when the girls were in the living room, I switched the channel. They were little and I didn't want them to see it. I figured that was something their parents could talk to them about.    Edit: I love how the neocons are trying to bring up Obama for this question.

I had been out late the nightr before after Monday Night Football, having had a goodly number of handmade microbrews so I went to beds earlier than usual so I awoke earlier than usual, around 0530 or so. I awoke and reached over and popped the button which turned on my clock radio and was listening to NPR when they interrupted the news to announce a plane had hit the World Trade Center. My initial thought was, "Oh no, not again!" I thought this becauase a few days before, I had watched a program on some channel and they showed pictures of a WW2 bomber which had run into the Empire State Building. 15 minutes later, I knew for certain it was no accident. I got up, put on  a bathrobe and turned on CNN and then was glued to the tube for days, leaving my chair only to eat and use the bathroom. I could not turn away from what I was seeing. I do not think I slept for more than a few minutes at a time for a week. Most of the time my mind was numb, blank. I do not remember much of that whole week except a growing feeling of the most terrible ANGER. I am a non-violent person, but at that time, had I been in a position to retaliate against the people who DID this terrible thing, I probably would have done so and I think I would have had NO regrets.

dyQNG6V8aa	I think its because it cannot be monitered and controlled very well.  Anyone really could grow it themselves if they wanted to.  Whereas things such as alcohol and cigarettes are licensed and taxed.      I do totally agree with you though that there are more troublesome drugs out there than cannabis.  I have never smoked cannabis in my life and not about to start but I really believe that people binge drinking is a much more severe problem than some people smoking weed.  I have seen some awful sights in my home town due to people binge drinking, girls with their a55es hanging out puking on themselves, men (and women) fighting and drawing blood.  if you go into the city centre on a sat or sun morning, its a river of puke, vile.  This is so much worse than people smoking a bit of weed and chilling out.|`|iqZUd5Fdaa	Tradition. Alcohol and tobacco have been a huge part of british culture for a very long time, before we knew what effect they have on our bodies, so our laws have bent around them, despite, as you rightly say, being more harmful than other drugs.

Gingrey showed a bit of backbone for speaking up ... good for him!|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Gingrey's reputation in the Georgia State Senate was that of a social conservative and a member of the Christian right. In the Georgia Senate he supported outlawing abortion and interpreted the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution as giving individual citizens rather than state militias a right to keep and use firearms. He also strongly supported the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, as well as the tax cuts of President George W. Bush. He opposes the provision of universal national health care. I don't know what he disagreed with but I do know he didn't vote for the stimulus plan. I think this article was written by liberal journalist that can't hold a candle to Limbaugh and Hannity . Liberals will follow their leader down the bowels of hell then to agree with republicans. It seems to me they saw someone who disagreed and they jumped all over it|`|jBRAT3Nxaa	It is really disappointing that reasonable Republicans (and there are some of them out there) are basically lynched for trying quell the venom of the extreme right wing.

Now that they lack clear leadership the party is total disarray.|`|PDYdcSliaa	The only thing Hannity and Limbaugh are good for is promoting discord.  It's time for the country to unite to get through the crisis we're in.  Those two do nothing but promote hate, and their appeal is to those who are intolerant and full of distrust and hatred.  I think it's a crime that these men are paid so well for their unpatriotic vitriol.    Kudos to those republicans who think for themselves and stand up to these bullies.    .|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	It isn't.  And if more Republicans would realize that Rep. Gingrey is right, the country would be much less divided.  Rush and Hannity are some of the examples of divide and conquer method of politicing that started with Karl Rove.  It's ugly, destructive and totally unecessary.  Democrats aren't the enemy, just the other side of the coin.|`|m1HVh5YUaa	Christ! Because the government shouldn't be criticizing private individuals that are speaking their mind!!! How ignorant can people be led to become?    They shouldn't even be talking about Limbaugh.

It showed for the next 8 years. That being said it was thanks to the Republican economic plan that the economy became what it was under Clinton. Also the down spiral we have suffered under Bush is not entirely due to Bush bad politic if you recall it all started at the end of clinton presidency with the fall of Giant Enron. Enron was the perfect example of the type of number manipulations and greed that laid the foundation to what we have witness lately.

I disagree with Limbaugh on all his subject matter, I don't listen to the man but feel he is promised his right as as American to continue to do so.|`|Ljq25VEJaa	Rush states things the way he does for ratings.  His job is dependent on controversy and coverage.  It probably wasn't conveyed the best, but I don't think he meant to be pleasant about it.  I look at this way.  I don't want Obama to have liver failure, heart failure, fail a piss test, or even fail to get it up tonight, but I do, in a way, wish he fails, especially with this stimulus package.  I hold conservative principals, I don't agree with his ideas.  Maybe I think if he succeeds, it will be a failure for this country.  Maybe I think if he fails, our country will have a chance at recovery and success.  The problem with Rush's statement is everybody assumed and equated Obama's failure with the failure of the country.  That is just not the case.  I think if he fails, it could be better for the country.  Hell, nobody can agree.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Yes! Why don't you take Rush's statement for what it is ..... he knows BO's policys are radical and bad for this country hence his statement.

It does not have to be in any way, shape, manner, or form a divisive issue.  So I have a proposal.  As has been noted, elections have consequences. President Obama in the meeting on Friday with House and Senate Republican leaders, Eric Cantor from Virginia in the House proposed a moderate tax cut plan. Obama said, Well, you know, "I won." I'm going to trump you on that.  We're not going to do that. Well, where's the bipartisanship, President Obama?  There is no bipartisanship in President Obama's plan.  President Obama's definition of bipartisanship is when Republicans cave and agree with his plan so he can then claim it's bipartisan.  But he's not compromising on anything here.      Mine is a genuine compromise.  So let's look at how the vote came out, shall we?  Fifty-three percent of voters in this country -- we'll say, for the sake of this proposal, 53% of Americans -- voted for Obama.  Forty-six percent voted for Senator McCain, and 1% voted for wackos.  Let's give the remaining 1% to President Obama, so let's say that 54% voted for President Obama and 46% voted for Senator McCain.

bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	I agree - these things should not be in an emergency bill.      These are not mandatory for economy revival.  They may be of benefit in the future WHEN the Country can afford it - but now is not the time.    It is irresponsible for Pork projects to be pushed into an emergency stimulus, and very deceiving.  They can not seem to put their own agendas to the side for the good of f the country and I think it is insulting to Americans and a spit in the face.    Not noticed by media?  Even if they do notice - do you think they will really report on it accurately?  I don't.      A lot of this "STIMULUS" will not even be circulated until after 2010 - how does that help NOW?  It doesn't.  It is just future planning for pork and special interest projects.  It is wrong to include it on THIS piece of legislation - it should be looked at on a separate piece of legislation at a more appropriate time.

We will have to be totally dependent on the government for our very survival we will become workers for the republic like in the Great Depression but worse.|`|8Z5cqbrQaa	Lets see. First most of us called our reps and told them to not vote for the first stimulus plan that was suppose to be 700 billion. Now they are proposing 830billion and maybe more for a bailout further weakening our dollar. This problem cannot be solved by thowing money at it. We are at the point where our ammount of debt is non repayable. This is what has destroyed many governments in the past. We may not just be looking at an economic collapse but a government collapse. We must stop printing money The rate of inflation is going to bite us in the rear. This problem could be solved with in a couple years as long as government stays out of it. But by throwing money at it we may no exit this recession for another 5 maybe 10 years.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	It isn't a stimulus, it's just Communist light ideals.  If gov't could spend itself into prosperity then Communism would have worked.  It doesn't work.  The idea that gov't takes money from people and spends it how they see fit to make the economy prosper doesn't make any sense.  Communists around the world try this exact model and it's flawed.  I don't understand why the Democrat Party believes this proven wrong policy will work now or ever.|`|AA11209233	Take a look at the details of the package--some will get you more upset, while others will ease your mind a bit.  For example, the doubling of the education budget includes a lot of money for school building and renovation--the kind of spending that creates jobs and stimulates the economy.  I won't deny that there is a good bit of fluff that doesn't help the economy lumped in there too however.  I think that some of the democrats have the attitude that if the republicans are going to deficit spend to help their interests, that they will deficit spend to help their interests.    It is too early to start criticizing Obama (and he certainly has not approved this bill yet!), but I'm sure you'll get a legit chance to do so soon enough.  This bill hasn't been out of the appropriations committee very long.  When we see what Congress is going to send Obama, then he can start evaluating what is from the pork barrell and what we need.  And then you can judge him.    There hasn't been a legit presidential candidate that believed in fiscal responsibility since Ross Perot.  Clinton is the only one who presided over a Congress that actually spent less than they brought in, and a lot of why he could do that was because he didn't have the kinds of problems we do today.  Both parties tax and spend with no regard for responsibility--the difference between republicans and democrats is who to tax and what to spend it on.|`|AA12066574	This stimulus will stimulate even more people to suckle at the government teat.

I think you need to realize Obama and the democratic congress do no walk in lockstep.|`|Ry61ViNZaa	A major component of Obamas economic stimulus plan is to immediately create 500,000 government jobs.    How is creating a bigger government, a greater tax and deficit burden, a stimulus to the economy?    Wouldnt it be more beneficial to Main Street to lower taxes on individuals and the private sector so as to put spending money back in their pockets and thus creating real jobs and goods and services?    We do not need more government intervention in our lives or that of the private sector. We need more personal responsibility and less of an entitlement mentality by the people of this nation!|`|24T71hYjaa	Which is why i did not vote for him.

More like a government stimulus package.    I am still trying to figure out how the government giving itself $1 trillion is going to stimulate a free market.|`|gRfqjemmaa	It is mostly democrats finally being able to pass junk bills they have been lobbying for years to get passed. 5 billion will go to ACORN, Obama's child, who illegally managed to help get him elected, and get a majority in the house. This is just the beginning folks. You have voted for this, and now you have to eat it. Canada is absolutely furious about a phrase that states all materials used for a stimulus project be made in the USA. This flies in the face of an agreement between the two countries, so we will see what happens there. This is a world wide recession, some say caused by the democrats in the USA, and their corrupt compadres. I am not sure who caused it, just know we all have to work together to fix it! Then the culpritts should be rounded up and hanged!

Those who say ACORN isn't getting anything - have not paid attention - and I am not talking about Rush at all.  He is irrelevant.    The Dem supported NEWS has even exposed this and it is right in the bill presented.    Many don't want to look at the facts and acknowledge where this started - it blows their entire argument out of the water - why should they want to see the truth about it.    Our children and grandchildren are truly go to be at the mercy of the government and other countries government - but then - who cares, right, as long as greed and corruption gets what they want now.    Pathetic and shameful is what has happened!|`|09aGRz8paa	this is so yesterday!|`|AA11295048	Check your figures I saw 3 billion dollars was  Acorn's cut for rigging the election.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Another classic of Government hypocrisy.  Party affiliation in irrelevant.      ACORN is a bunch of Libs who stuffed ballot boxes.  They were caught but to my knowledge NO ONE got prosecuted.  Why?  Because it is a Lib organization.  If the NRA got caught doing the same thing ACORN did the NRA would be torn apart.  People would be arrested and prosecuted followed by convictions and lengthy prison terms.  All of it front page headlines in the press.    But because ACORN did it, the Lib press is very quiet.    No wonder people hate the press and it's very obvious Liberal slant.|`|4a2b4c38598195f530e54c08fa3e232aaa	Nothing is going to ACORN.  Stop listening to Rush.|`|a881b642b5cabdf60bb0949b22b810ddaa	Seems we all can see the trees in the forest except those in Washington - or can they? To respond by saying 'stop listening to Rush' is simply following the leader (Obama and company) and not using our G-d given intelligence.     We keep worrying about our kids and grand kids, but I think it is very possible that we will be there before we have the chance to leave it to them. We have 2 more years of seriously bad decisions. Even Obama told congress to cut out the pork and they laughed at him. He should have held a private meeting with Democrat instead of Republican congressmen. Government can cause all of us to be dependent upon them. Once that happens America is beyond recovery.  "That can't happen in America."??? Check your history.

But there are many who are born to very disheartening circumstances and rise up out of the ashes and succeed to greatness !    Now don't get me wrong, to me,obama is NOT great,actually quiet the opposite in my opinion...but this youtube video is pretty 'in your face' to people who think it is "ok" to go ahead and put a child out it's "misery".

A woman's body and what's in it shouldn't be turned into some law.  It's her body.  Unless you want the government to own your uterus.    Abortion isn't an easy choice.  But sometimes, it's the right choice.  A woman has the right to control what's in her body.  She shouldn't have to be a mother if she doesn't want to be.  Abortion is better than infanticide.  Condoms break, vasectomies fail, the pill doesn't always work.  There are so many more I could list.|`|o23hIdOvaa	Im pro-choice, not pro-abortion.

A fetus is just a parasite, not a HUMAN!  Kill them all!|`|h6vOjCaPaa	I think it is wonderful to imagine the potential of every life. However for every Obama there is a young man who dies in the street in poverty or in violence because even though his mother knew she couldn't handle raising him she went through with it anyways. While abortions should be reduced in number and only used as a desperate last resort, it is wrong of us to force misery and pain on a child just because of what might be unless the mother truly believes that both she and the child will be able to survive that  experience.

F3UxxmrLaa	Much of Africa doesn't keep those records and, if they did so, they would be grossly understated as so many crimes are not reported to authorities at all.
t3A9qpQIaa	While probably true about the younger child; that is conjecture, fiction.  Fact is they did do it and I suggest that you just keep quiet and pay it.  Lousy as it seems, kids do dumb things just like we did when we were their age.  I bet you a ton of money the dealership is making sure all cars are locked at night.  Bite the bullet.  Bummer.  At least they are not pressing charges which is the ethical thing to do.  They could have pressed charges and your kid gets a criminal record.  I'm sure he feels bad about it.  Have a long gentle talk with him (them) kindly telling them about being in the wrong place at the wrong time and maybe make him pay or pay part of it at least.  I think it is a good lesson albeit not so pleasant.  Dealer ship is not at all responsible because they no doubt practice security and vigilance as ordinary and usual, legal terms which apply.  Your boy could also be charged with trespassing with or without locked gate.  This is not murky about who is responsible.  Your son is, period.  You are not.  I definitely think he should pay a good amount.  If he has no savings to pay then make him work it off.  If he has savings, 1/3 to 1/4.  Nothing teaches a lesson like an economic hit.  It is big deal. Very serious.  Do not let it pass easily.  You are doing no favor by paying it all off and saying he isn't totally responsible.  We all need to own our mistakes.  He needs to learn that too.  If you really love him, let this be a lesson to him.  Think of it this way; if you have to work hard to get something it has greater value to you.  If you punish something appropriate to the deed, he will not likely do something like that again. Ie. disrespect others property and the law.  Don't be wishy-washy.  Be strong.  He will respect you and himself.  Ground and pay and work.  Equal parts.  You will be teaching him how to be a real man.  A real man owns his mistake and makes restitution.  He will be respected by others too.  I also think he should go to the GM of the dealership and with no excuses at all, apologize.  Something like "I want to apologize for trespassing and destroying your property.  (don't minimize and no excuses)  Their words but undiminished.  Not to mention anything more.  Most likely the GM will say he knows they were very scared and he''s sorry it happened too.  Believe me as a young person, many will respect him for that.  The sole reason he appoligizes is that it is the right thing to do.|`|ycSCd8Oraa	Pay it off, it's not worth the trouble.|`|w9t7J6chaa	If the door was unable to be unlocked with someone who had a deftly average amount of intelligence, then it is also a safety hazard to people buying the car.    It was your fault your son did that.|`|2xO8AxYRaa	Its your responsibility plain and simple, but the best thing you can do is make your child pay to have the window replaced. Talked to the dealership owner and see if maybe your son can work off the damages. You and the owner will in the long run help your son.|`|K1iUzewyaa	yeah, you should meet in the middle. maybe 425 each, which still seems too high to me, but I guess it is a corvette. They should take the other 425.00 from the lazy asshole who forgot to check the handles to make sure the cars were locked... Sometimes dealership lots let you go on their whenever and check out their vehicles without any one being there.. they should have known not to leave the doors unlocked, especially if corvettes have that feature on them.... so I would talk it over with the dealership to try to meet in the middle first.. by the way, what kind of dealership is closed on MLK??? hmm, maybe the kind who forget to lock their darn doors... Have your son get a job to pay you back when he gets older... good luck... dang, after checking out all these thumbs down, realize lots of car dealers on here... lock your corvette doors...|`|MWJOEikkaa	Kick their a**es make your boys work for you till they pay it back.  I also sell cars they break my windows to steal stereos.  I can not believe you would like to make the dealer accountable for the boys actions.  A dead boy be real they could yell right! LMAO.  Lucky you have to pay for a window it could be trespassing, damage to property, etc  Always lay the blame else where. LMAO!|`|03f88dab68fc06f2847983e6c004d5b5aa	Personally I would tell the dealer where to shove the $850 they want for the window and threaten them with with negligence. Make them sue me for the money. Age 14 is still a child. My 14 year old could not have broken the window to get out and would have not been found until someone went to check on the cars, possibly not alive. If the dealer did press charges I would bring out the negligence during the case. What would the kid get charged with? Mischief maybe? But then again that is just what I would do. Hell if a burgular can break into your house and sue you for getting cut while breaking your window....? It's not really a matter of what is really right and responsible, it's a matter of what the law says is right.|`|AA11206283	The dealership is not responsible for a younger weaker child getting lost or stuck anywhere. The parents are.     It's a reasonable assumption that a dealership will have open unlocked cars there. It's a reasonable assumption that parents will keep track of their children.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	NO NO NO, you can NOT get upset with the car dealership and tell them they were lucky your son was able to get out, because its not their fault. You son was somewhere he was NOT supposed to be doing something he was NOT supposed to do. It is in no way at all the dealerships fault. It is their private property and if they want to leave their doors to all the cars Unlocked then they can do so. What if you kid climbed into a neighbors car and did the same thing? are you gunna sue your neighbor for not keeping their car locked? You are VERY lucky that the dealership is not pressing charges on your son because not only would he be liable for the damages to the car but he was on private property and broke into a car when he was not supposed to. You should pay the place to fix the window and have alittle chat with your son, he needs to stay off private property and out of cars that are not his.|`|N3fpoUOzaa	i don't think you can blame the dealer ship for this one. Your kid was in the wrong place and he shouldn't have been on there property and getting into cars. Best thing to do would be pay the money.     well im no lawyer so if you really want go to a lawyer and ask them to make sure and if your lucky you wont have to pay nothing    good luck :)|`|AA11494150	That may be carelessness on the dealers part, but it is certainly not negligence, which would be the burden required to prove your side in court.    The only negligent ones were the boys. 13 is well beyond the age of reason, and their actions were not reasonable.    If you do decide to contest this, and your son is found responsible (which is very likely), you could wind up with bigger problems. You will still be liable for restitution, plus court costs, plus your son having a juvenile record.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	''' IF IF IF IF IF ""your younger weaker irresponsible out of control child died under these circumstances you should be arrested.....you agree to pay half and discipline your child properly providing the other parent does the same.....otherwise you insist the dealership file charges and the courts decide punishment and restitution....is there really any other way to handle this?.....you contact me and tell me how this is going to be handled.....

One good thing tho he had 8 weeks off when he returned!! more than normal paternity leave and he used his noral paternity 2 weeks later in the year.  think seriously if ur gonna plan it, it was hard going being alone during pregnancy having the worries of him being out there too.  Our baby wasnt planned but it all worked out just fine.|`|WrDGhduxaa	if he is over seas, no, he can not come home for the birth.|`|AA10709853	no leave is authorized while deployed unless in a life or death situation.

Remember,  a UNIT is a unit and if one guy goes the unit is not complete.  It puts the other guys at risk as there is a hole in the unit.   They deploy together and they come home together.   Specially if they are in a war zone.       I suggest if you want another baby and want him there you do some planning on when you get PG.

Honestly, you are already supporting the troops by being married to one and if it were me, I would stay home with my son.  Not to be negative, but what would happen if you both were deployed and neither of you came back to your son?  We pray that is doesn't happen, but you need to think realistically at this situation.  I hope this gives you a little guidance in the right direction.  When it's all said and done, you know what's best for your family.|`|HCKPDXhpaa	Well I'm active military. If you go reserve you will be stationed overseas. First you'll have to do Basic Training and AIT school over there. Then you'll be given a duty station overseas.

Either way you're still being deployed.|`|jthpq6Egaa	A lot depends on the reserve unit you're looking to join and also your MOS.  It may be that it's your unit's time to deploy (my friend joined as a linguist in '06 and his reserve unit is now getting ready to deploy here in March).  Best thing is to see if you can get some information and see what mission requirements they are filling (ask your husband to inquire for you since he is in the military).    But you also need to keep in mind that there are occasions when a request for an individual augmentee(s) may come down due to your particular MOS.  In such cases, you'll be activitated solo or as part of a small group in order to fill the active duty (deployment) requirement.    Ultimately though, in answer to your question, there's nothing you can claim to keep you from a UNIT deployment.  As far as being called up for an individual or small group requirement, I've found that they'll ask for volunteers first.  Then they'll tag Soldiers to fill in the gaps - but in such cases, you can work with your command and let them know of your situation (if your husband is deployed).  Most will tend to be empathetic to your situation but it's still at their discretion to deploy you.  Now, keep in mind that if you're the only Soldier in your unit to fit the requirement (MOS/rank), then you're going.|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	Don't join the military if you're not willing to deploy.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	maybe. some get to stay here and some get shipped off|`|neWbgaHCaa	Every single parent or dual military service member that has children are required to have a "Dependents care plan". This plan spells out what, where, when, who and how your children will be cared for in the event that you and you husband are deployed.  You will need to have plans for where you children will go and to who. A sample of all the required legal documents.  I hope this helps you out in your decision.|`|xXIm13Mcaa	I read the question, here is your answer.  9 out of 10 you WILL be deployed, maybe at the same time and then again maybe not. Because your hubby is already in they will make you have a family care plan before you can join, in the case of you both being deployed at the same time which probably WILL happen within the first two years, they will fully expect you to leave your child with whomever is on that family care plan. Thay wont care if your husbands already over there. You sign a contract and that contract shall be enforced or there are major consequences.  Think it over first. Good luck.|`|iOys3vneaa	from what you say, i would recommend not joining. it doesnt sound like you have the heart for it. and if you were to join, you would HAVE to have a family care plan for your child anyways. if you only want to join the reserves AND you dont want to deploy, whats the point?? no one likes a "draft dodger". no offense, but dont waste the army's time or money just so you can "claim" something later on down the road and ride a profile.|`|3HEsdw3Gaa	How would we know.

wuIxDbosaa	Contrary to what 'rememberthecole' (now thats not a good example is it - yes we remember the cole and what a couple of blokes in an inflatable can do), Australia's northern borders are reasonably well protected, if not by nature, but by a ready combination of troops used to the region and military air strips dotted across the North.      Neither Indonesia or China has a reputation for respecting life, so by sheer numbers they could succeed.  Unfortunately for them though, we are the type of country that would make Iraq look like a walk in the park when it came to guerilla warfare.  True, we did have a contigency plan to evacuate the Northern regions, but we have a greater population and infrastructure now.  ANZAC troops have a great fighting tradition, including in the jungles of Vietnam, where a handfull of Australians wiped the floor with a significantly larger force of VC on their own turf.    Australians would no doubt burn every resource, but our sly american friends have a huge stake in our natural resources, including Chevron who have a large piece of the pie when it comes to LNG and Oil in the NW of Australia, so I think that would be their only motivation as our so-called allies.  The Chinese have a huge stake in our iron ore industry (unfortunately) so that could have something to do with it in the long run.    In reality, we probably have more to fear from Americans ripping off our natural resources than the Asians.  The Indonesians love to have a go every now and again, but they couldn't organise a p!ss up in a brewery.  Remember Kokoda, there again Aussies stuck it to the Japanese forces, without the Yanks watching our backs.  Lucky for us we do have some good allies who would stick with us, as long as we didn't rely on the americans.  Personally I think a combined force of Pom, Kiwi and Aussie forces could give a blood nose to anyone who stepped up.  The SAS from either of these countries could make them think twice after a few well planned raids.    Anyway, if anyone was to invade, they'd probably come via the least hospitable places, and by the millions.  Which would thin the numbers enough for us to do some damage.  Besides we have enough american spy installations in this country for the yanks to show some back bone and come to someone else's aid for a change.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Knowing that Australia is one of those British Empire nations that does not trust it subjects,  I would not worry about the citizens having guns and fighting tooth and nail.   So all an invader would have to worry about is the armed forces,  such as they are.      First an invader would have to take out the Australian Navy,  a whole 60 ships with no aircraft carriers.  The only ships that I would worry about are the six diesel-electric subs.  Everything else is a surface ship and would be relatively easy to take out with Harpoons or Exocets.      Second,  the Air Force.  They have 20 or so Vietnam era F111s that could be used for long range recon and as a medium bomber.  They are due to retire in 2010 so if I was worried about them I would wait two years.  They have about 110 F18 fighters.   Those are not air superiority fighters like the F15 or F14 so if I got a plane specifically designed for air superiority,  I would not worry about them either.    Third,  having taken out the Navy and the Air Force,  I would have air superiority.  All that would be left to deal with is the Army.  45,000 total,  including Reservists.   Hardly a force to worry about.   When you consider how big Australia is and how poor the roads are,  it would be unlikely they could mass forces if one area was invaded.  If several invasion points were used,  they could maybe meet an invasion with 10,000 at most.   Lacking air cover,  they could easily be taken out with a neutron bomb or chemical attack.       The ONLY thing Australia has going for them is distance from their enemies,  large size of their nation and the ability to burn their northern cities and to flee to the other side of the desert.  That was their plan in WW II until MacArthur told them it was a bad plan.       Now that you have an idea of how easy it would be,  why do it?  Just exactly does Australia have that would make someone spend the time and effort to invade?  They have no major oil fields,  they are not a "bread basket" of food and in fact they are having drought problems,  they are not an industrial power house,  etc.   It would cost more to invade than what benefit you could get doing it.       In fact,  it is not worth the trouble as you would probably have the entire British Empire coming after you if you tried it.   While the Armed forces of Australia are not much,   you add in all that of the Commonwealth and you might have a problem.   Specially since Britain is a nuclear power.|`|Ac23HTTTaa	Yes, you have to be smart with special tactics.

1uLfl0sXaa	Hitler, the greatest proponent of the anti- Semitic ideology was also one- quarter Jewish.       After dropping the bomb he looked at me with impassioned eyes.       This is preposterous, I dont believe it. I blurted   He was neither snubbed nor pleased. His grandmother, Maria Schicklgruber, became pregnant while working as a servant in a wealthy Jewish household. The implications of this fact were politically explosive for Hitler and were reason enough to conceal his origins. There is a book by Robert G. L. Waite,  The Psychopathic God: Adolf Hitler. According to this book, Hitler made it illegal for German women to work in Jewish households, and after the annexation of Austria, Hitler turned his father's hometown into an artillery practice area. No stories were allowed to escape the town   But, that doesnt prove that he was half or quarter Jewish.  I stammered   Certain things are not easy to prove diametrically; one has to go by the circumstantial evidences and draw ones own conclusions. He often was a guest for dinner in a noble Jewish house in Linz, a small town on the western frontier, and he interacted well with Jewish merchants who tried to sell his paintings. On a personal note, he had nothing against the Jews. His claims that Jews were enemies of the   Aryan race, holding them responsible for Austria's crisis, identifying certain forms of Socialism and Bolshevism, which had many Jewish leaders, as Jewish movements were all aimed at arousing the Germans and capturing total power. The wiles that Jews were the culprits of Germanys downfall and economic problems went well with the already disheartened and fed-up masses that rallied behind him in multitudes.|`|35ZJauLkaa	He use them as a focus point to direct public anger, much like the media and government are doing the white male these days....

When he read the Bible, he figured that since the Jews were responsible for the cruxifiction of Jesus, they were responsible for all of society's ills.    As Germany was going through a very rough economic time (due to having to pay war reparations for WWI) Hitler also blamed the influx of Jews as "leeching" off the system.  He used propaganda to turn public sentiment against the Jews.  He also hated everyone of non Ayran descent and those he deemed "sub-human" such as blacks and gays.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	To Hitler, the Jews were the ones prospering at the expense of the German people.

f2b9bac6ba2f1b4719753cb0987d5d4faa	Kennedy.. Krushchev.. Castro, U-2 Planes, Naval blockade.        The Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest the world ever came to nuclear war. The United States armed forces were at their highest state of readiness ever and Soviet field commanders in Cuba were prepared to use battlefield nuclear weapons to defend the island if it was invaded. Luckily, thanks to the bravery of two men, President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev, war was averted.    In 1962, the Soviet Union was desperately behind the United States in the arms race. Soviet missiles were only powerful enough to be launched against Europe but U.S. missiles were capable of striking the entire Soviet Union. In late April 1962, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range missiles in Cuba. A deployment in Cuba would double the Soviet strategic arsenal and provide a real deterrent to a potential U.S. attack against the Soviet Union.    Meanwhile, Fidel Castro was looking for a way to defend his island nation from an attack by the U.S. Ever since the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, Castro felt a second attack was inevitable. Consequently, he approved of Khrushchev's plan to place missiles on the island. In the summer of 1962 the Soviet Union worked quickly and secretly to build its missile installations in Cuba.    Missile Map For the United States, the crisis began on October 15, 1962 whenreconnaissance photographs revealed Soviet missiles under construction in Cuba. Early the next day, President John Kennedy was informed of the missile installations. Kennedy immediately organized the EX-COMM, a group of his twelve most important advisors to handle the crisis. After seven days of guarded and intense debate within the upper echelons of government, Kennedy concluded to impose a naval quarantine around Cuba. He wished to prevent the arrival of more Soviet offensive weapons on the island. On October 22, Kennedy announced the discovery of the missile installations to the public and his decision to quarantine the island. He also proclaimed that any nuclear missile launched from Cuba would be regarded as an attack on the United States by the Soviet Union and demanded that the Soviets remove all of their offensive weapons from Cuba.    During the public phase of the Crisis, tensions began to build on both sides. Kennedy eventually ordered low-level reconnaissance missions once every two hours. On the 25th Kennedy pulled the quarantine line back and raised military readiness to DEFCON 2. Then on the 26th EX-COMM heard from Khrushchev in an impassioned letter. He proposed removing Soviet missiles and personnel if the U.S. would guarantee not to invade Cuba. October 27 was the worst day of the crisis. A U-2 was shot down over Cuba and EX-COMM received a second letter from Khrushchev demanding the removal of U.S. missiles in Turkey in exchange for Soviet missiles in Cuba. Attorney General Robert Kennedy suggested ignoring the second letter and contacted Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin to tell him of the U.S. agreement with the first.    Tensions finally began to ease on October 28 when Khrushchev announced that he would dismantle the installations and return the missiles to the Soviet Union, expressing his trust that the United States would not invade Cuba. Further negotiations were held to implement the October 28 agreement, including a United States demand that Soviet light bombers be removed from Cuba, and specifying the exact form and conditions of United States assurances not to invade Cuba.|`|hexzaIGgaa	According to Robert McNamara...is it as close to nuclear war as the United States has ever been. Castro had already told the "Big K" (Nikita K.) to release the hounds. Fortunately, Mr. K (Nikita K.) had a brain and didn't do it.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Kennedy ordered a blockade 200 miles from Cuba so that the Russian ships had more time to turn around.   The US NAVY moved it out 600 miles in an attempt to cause a confrontation earlier.  Kennedy got really pissed off at that.    The USA had the same kind of missiles in Turkey.   After the Russians took their missiles out of Cuba,  the USA quietly took its missiles out of Turkey.   An even trade.    The USA promised never to invade Cuba.   We did not get the same kind of promise out of the Russians about Turkey.   So the USSR came out ahead on that deal.    Kennedy was a fool.  Had he carried out his promise about air support for the Bay of Pigs invasion,  the Russians probably would not have tried putting up the Berlin Wall.   Had Kennedy stood up to the Russians over the Berlin Wall,  they probably would not have tried to put missiles into Cuba.   Finally Kennedy found his balls,  but only after he brought us as close to nuclear war as we ever got.      For 40 years were could not speak bad of Kennedy because he was killed in office.

b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	I long for the day when the world finds an alternative to oil energy , Just to see the Arab states squeal unfair as there west tells them were to stuff there oil. I suspect there is such an alternative but is being kept under wraps because oil revenue is a good way for western governments to rip us all of big time . I have experimented with hydrogen and it works very well and is very cheap to produce , and so simple it seems childish , and i am only a layman what could a determined Scientific study produce . I used a bottle of water with two steel rods and the power from my car battery plus one spoonful of baking powder,  piped the hydrogen into my injection engine and it ran the engine on tick over very well , with the injection system disabled . the cost almost nil . Now if i know this why isn't this cheap easy power source being utilised . The answer must be the vested interests including governments are keeping it away from the public in fear that because of the simplicity and ease of production we will tell them to keep there very expensive petrol , and produce a home made variety of hydrogen and it would be almost impossible for them to stop us. PS it produces no emissions either only clean water .Warning!!!!!! hydrogen is more volatile than petrol|`|sSOlggK1aa	How is that blackmail ?  Who are they blackmailing - I just don't see it in the report.    >>>    Blackmail is the crime of threatening to reveal substantially true information about a person to the public, a family member, or associates unless a demand made upon the victim is met. This information is usually of an embarrassing and/or socially damaging nature. As the information is substantially true, the act of revealing the information may not be criminal in its own right nor amount to a civil law defamation; the crime is making demands to withhold it. English Law creates a much broader definition of blackmail, covering any unwarranted demands with menaces, whether involving revealing information or not.    Blackmail is similar to extortion. The difference is that extortion involves an underlying, independent criminal act, while blackmail does not.    The word is derived from the word for tribute (in modern terms, protection money) paid by English and Scottish border dwellers to Border Reivers known also as Free-booters, in return for immunity from raids and other harrassment. This tribute was paid in goods or labour (reditus nigri, or "blackmail"): the opposite is blanche firmes or reditus albi, or "white rent" (denoting payment by silver).    Edit for dave>>>>  So I asume you agree that the answer is 'NO' as it is not a case of blackmail.

He is offering too many social programs and bailout packages.  His programs  are filled with pork that will do nothing to help us out of our current recession problems. I wish I hadn't voted for him.|`|DypTl9Zdaa	So far my opinion is not good.  He has been President for 9 days and is pressing Congress to pass a so-called stimulus package worth 819 billion dollars.  Before Obama was elected he preached loud and long about "no pork" in the bills that he tries to push through.  80% of what's in the bill now won't be spent until 2010 so how can pushing this bill be so urgent if it isn't going to do anything for another year or more?  Why?  Because it is now payback time to those who supported his campaign.  In other words...pork!  Most of the paybacks will be in the form of welfare and social programs.  I believe that ACORN has lots of rewards to claim too.  On that note, isn't it a little curious that most all ACORN offices have shut down their computers taken to storage and all of a sudden the investigations into voter fraud have gone away?  Interesting how these things happen.    Obama also promised that he would have no lobbyists in his administration.  Well who do you think Robert Gates, ERic Holder, Tim Geither and Robert Gibbs are?  The one that really gets me is Geither as head of the US Treasury-IRS.  He didn't pay his own taxes until he got caught.  What the hell?

I wonder how she gets to stay here on welfare for so many years...ILLEGALLY  http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28892998/    An Obama QUOTE is .... We ARE our brother's keepers.  Yet, Obama's brother,George Hussein Onyango Obama,  lives in poverty ($1 per month) while Obama lives in a million dollar mansion that Tony Rezko helped him buy.

It would be wrong for him to support his aunt ILLEGALLY being her - he commented once on this and he said he will not interfere with the law on this - if she violated the law, she must face the outcome.    Regarding his family in Kenya - well, that is on him personally.  I personally would send some money, but that is me.  That is between him and them.    He does appear to have GREAT love of his wife and children, I can not knock him there either.    Caring about the american people - only a portion of them perhaps, that agree with his agenda.  I didn't vote for him so I don't think his interests in this Country as it Constitutional should be is in his interests.    Bush, he wasn't perfect, but I think he did care about the American people as people, however, he and his father also approved of the New World order, in fact, his father is one who brought the idea into the public light.  Government officials seem to all have the same end goal in America - they just have different view so n how to get there.  Some more apparent than others, some more controlling than others, but in the end, the same goal with different spins to it.

KTM5JEkLaa	It depends on the statute of limitations on the crime, which is varies on the crime and the laws of the jurisdiction.  Murder is one that typically has no statute of limitations, so in theory the investigation can continue indefinitely.     On a practical basis, most significant evidence is short-lived.  In police investigations, the typical standard is 48 hours, then after that time, the trail of evidence grows cold and more difficult to investigate. Obviously, this is not a hard and fast rule, but it is the goal.  I have taken months to complete a case, while some cases can take years when a crucial piece of evidence such as human remains, a weapon, or a lost witness, appear to blow open the case.    Incidentally, this is why a properly conducted investigation can involve thousands of pages of documentation and boxes of evidence since each piece of the puzzle must be clearly documented and detailed info on how it relates to the case must be given.  This is in the event that the original investigator leaves the agency for some reason and another investigator must take up where the other left off.

Then we educate those kids, feed them and house them.. And when they become of voting age all they see is "the us wants to take my parents away"...Then the piss poor public education takes affect and their liberal interpretations of the law allows them to erode our laws inch by inch through lawsuits.......

You would probalbly better off giving up your citizenship and becoming an illegal.  You then could get free education, free medical, free ability to sell drugs with just a minor slap on the wrist, free eligibility for gang membership to rule your neighborhood, free from taxes, free from responsibility.  Illegals are dragging down our society.|`|5fXNW1y4aa	That only applies to immigration laws in most cases. Not to the really important laws, like those that regulate not to steal, not to kill, etc|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	Because they are above the law. Look at what our governments expectations are on illegals.

If they get caught they get sent back home only to return and start the process all over again.

From your question I know what YOU think. You think you're above everyone else because of YOUR legal status, but who knows what your legal status is.

Law enforcement tells us "ignorance is no excuse" yet they let illegals get away with serious offenses based on "I didn't know"|`|spuz7DvNaa	Liberals support illegal immigrant flooding this country because they know illegal immigrants will vote for the party of handouts and freebies.     Illegal immigrants are a way for them to gain more power. Democrats do not care if they destroy this country as long as they can further their agenda towards unhindered abortion, drug use, homosexuality, public sex and the ability to stifle free speech and Christians.    This is why illegal immigrants feel empowered to think they are above the law because they are. They know our lawmakers do not enforce the laws.
AA11206283	You'd need an order of the probate court approving any sale to yourself individually from executor of an estate. I'm not sure a court would approve.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	what is fair market value these days?  discuss all of your concerns with the attorney handling the case.
PxWORcvEaa	Definitely lawyer up. Him being executor? He's lying. Why do you think he doesn't want you attending the probate meeting? If he broke in and the car is gone? File a police report(report the car stolen) and get them involved. It'll leave a trail in case the cousin tries something again and he will.     Don't count on your cousin to give you any info, so that's why you'll need a shark of a lawyer. The fact that the cousin is "long lost" is telling right there. He's "long lost" for a reason and he could lose credibility due to that. He "knows" more than you do? I say he knows more about bluffing. Even his "proof" could be fabricated.     Ask for help from other family members too and GET A LAWYER. If he really is the executor, you can sue him. But, like I said get a lawyer.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	You need to get a probate lawyer involved.  People will pull all kinds of tricks when money is involved.|`|ZfcDh4jqaa	You need to go to the probate court and talk with them, usually no appointment is needed.  If the cousin is not assigned executor of estate status in a will left by your grandfather, then the cousin doesn't necessarily have the right to probate the will.  If no will is present or can can not be located then the closest living relative should be the executor and also the sole heir.  There is a form when probating a will listing all of the closet relatives and if there is a dispute in who gets what then you will need to get lawyers and settle it in court.  If you are the closest living relative then you should have no problem winning.  Also you might be able to press charges against your cousin for violating the terms of probate by stealing the car and the keys to the house.

He is leading us closer to collapse. Some of his package doesn't even have anything to do with a fast fix to the economy like the stimulus is suppose to. What about the "family planning" part, It has nothing to do with the present problem. What about the study on the environment, They have allocated millions for it and the actual program doesn't even exist yet. What about the millions they have allocated for the prevention and study of STD's that isn't something that will jump start the economy. What about the infrastructure, they are putting billions in it and only about 5% will really go to fix it and will only really generate a hand full of jobs. People you better look at that package and then right your congressman and complain. This package will cost us all dearly in the near future, We will be paying off debt for years to come and will cause a hugh increase in taxes.|`|AFqZEOlRaa	1.  Only the House has passed it.  It still has to go to the Senate.      2.  None of it has been spent yet, and it will take several years for it all to be spent.  And part of it is tax cuts, so that won't be spent, just lost.    3.  If you can't blame the last one on Bush, what makes it OK to blame this one on Obama?|`|Bk09TO3vaa	I personally don't think it will work because the details were not discussed and anytime someone tried to talk about them they were ignored. I am a B Obama supporter, but i am a bit disappointed with the way this package came out of the house.|`|ktc9usSqaa	We are blaming George Bush because he got us into a war that we should not have started by lying and cheating the American people.    He lied about why we had to go to war and over 4,000 service men and women have been killed because of his lies.    He caused the American Economy to collapse because the deregulation of banking rules, investment rules, insurance rules and because all the CEO's of these companies were his friends.    Now President Obama has to fix the mess George Bush created and could not get a handle on while he was President.    That is why we need this stimulus package to get people back to work.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	Get used to it, it was passed without any Republican votes.  They can ram anything down our throats that they want now.
gasquENMaa	Unfortunately, this is probably the most commonly asked question in this forum. You will find various sites that offer "free:" background checks. Most of them are not free and all of them are erroneous at best. The public sites you have access to are compiled from public records with no validity given to the information they are reporting.    The only background checks that are truly accurate are state level BCI ( $18 to $20 at your local police or sheriff's department) and a Federal NCIC check ( $68 at your local State Police barracks).     You can request your own background check and will have to submit a set of fingerprints for the NCIC. If you want to run a background on another person, you will need their written permission ( they have to request it themselves).    I hope this helps and you can find it useful|`|aM4BIEjraa	No!

AkIgv5WVaa	Oh yes. I think they've learned that many people think that their "great leader" and the govt. is going to/supposed to take care of them, and I mean support them, health care them, school them, clothe them, and give them a warm, happy feeling inside.     That way they won't have to exert themselves at a job that actually makes them work, they won't have to use their own money to get that new widescreen, ( until we pay so many taxes we can barely afford food, that is) and they will have their whole lives already planned out for them, so that really, they won't have to do much of anything but breathe.

AAIMeYeFaa	I'll admit it's fishy, but it's also January. January is W-2 season. And while for many companies and the U.S. Government the beginning of the financial year is between September and November, for many others it's January.    That doesn't rule anything out of course; with the sheer number of companies laying off, it's likely a few of them coordinated their efforts. "I was layed off on Black Monday" is a lot easier a pill to swallow than simply "I was layed off". In some industries (gas, for example), coordinated business practices are open and the status quo. It's unlikely that every company laying people off was in cahoots, though.    Of course, your guess is as good as mine at the end of the day.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	Probably for productivity and security reasons.

plFkELGbaa	Uttering threats is against the law.    I do request you use your best judgement here. It's easy to overreact to such a threat made idly, or taken out of context. The school and the police will likely take the threat very seriously. He could go to jail for some time whether he's really guilty of a crime or not.    Remember these are just kids. Ask yourself how much punishment this boy deserves for a slip of the tongue. Our legal system punishes children more harshly and with fewer checks and balances than adults in cases like these. Imagine back when you were a kid, getting dragged into the police station and forced to spend the night in jail because you got mad at someone and said something stupid.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, call the police!

As for President Obama (damn I like typing that), he just pointed out that America has problems that need to be solved and we need as many people as possible on the 'solution' side but Rush Limbaugh is choosing to be part of the problem and therefore is a distraction from America's recovery.|`|V44ARW4maa	The right is so full of themselves and they are obstructionists, and it really matters little who their "leader" is. That said, limplaw epitomizes the right wing wackos and as a registered independent, i find the gop to be equivalent to flys--who do nothing but eat $hit and bother people. It will be a long time before i ever even consider voting for anybody with an R next to their name.|`|f5705ff0a4dc130e92b935f3f3a73717aa	It may as well have been. But personally, I don't like it that the president of the United States gives someone like Limbaugh (a certified NUT CASE!) this much attention. I'm now waiting to see the ramifications, if any, from this move by Obama. I read somewhere that there was a strategy behind the whole think, that the Obama camp played around with the idea of inviting Limbaugh to one of their meetings about policy and the economy and backed out at the last minute - something that allegedly infuriated the conservative talk show host. Well, again, let's wait and see.     I think some other questions to be asked are:    1. How much power does Limbaugh really have?  2. How much power does the president think Limbaugh has?  3. How much power do Americans give someone like Limbaugh?    ?|`|XrU1I1wjaa	It's good that you bring up Michael Moore in your question. Both him and Limbaugh are FRAUDS.

This is really the private army of the Super Rich - they operate outside the law and they'll kill anybody who gets in their way.    Bush designed Blackwater to be supported initially at the public trough - we get to pay for these guys.  But if the economy would really fail, Blackwater would be paid for by the Super Rich  - and these guys would be the guards on the "gated communities" where you better not go to find food.  Let's hope the courts come down on these guys real hard!      Private Armies!  Real bad idea.  Blackwater has recently moved it's headquarters out of the United States probably so they can hide until we elect another brain-dead republican.
AkIgv5WVaa	Great news! Obama is good for SOMETHING.|`|pgdTmT6caa	What we are paid should not be someone else's business.  This is the beginning of Socialism when we are paid equal all around.  The first shall be last and the last shall be first.  This is the best way to do things.  There are directions to how we live life.  You will find them in the bible.  If we live by those directions we will understand how life works but there are many that don't want to do that because they are afraid of it or they don't think it is fare or it is too hard.  We always look for the easy way out.  This is why we have that one in the white house.  He is the easy way out but you know what?  The easy way is almost never the best way.  I could go on and on but I think I've said enough.|`|AA11847612	So theoretically speaking, as a small business owner I made $100k profit and decided to bring a new person on board and pay him $70k.

I'm so confused...    Change is grand.|`|66e03546d71298a34daadeb6dce02da6aa	It ridiculous to have federal bureaucrats decide what is "equal work."  Are they going to issue a list of what every possible occupation is supposed to make?      The reason companies don't want you discussing pay is they don't want those of either gender who are underpaid to realize what others are making.  That's an issue of greed, not gender discrimination.  Men are underpaid as well as women.  But wage controls from Washington is not the answer.
VYywucN8aa	congress has more power.

Legislative: (Congress)  Executive: (The President and his offices and cabinet.)  Judicial: (Supreme Court - YES, they are equally important and too much ignored by the American population.)  They are co-equal by law, but each tries to gain more than their fair share of POWER. They all want to be tyrants.|`|Lc5bThpkaa	Well you are right. Congress has way more power than The president.  people think bush sent us to war but george bush proposes it          they (congress) then approve it   so you cant blame george bush.  he has to get the bill passed to send more troops  he later will become one of the greatest presidents  but back to wat i was sayin.  I think that congress has the most power of anything  since they pass the bills.   please do not blame Bush for anything  For the troops they chose to serve this country   when they entered basic training.  the president can only propose the bill   he is probably the lowest powered person in the office|`|AA11209233	First, the President does have more power.  He can't get funding without the help of the House, but he has wide latitude in making executive orders that have the force of law.  Congress does not need to approve those--Congress can't even realistically fight them unless the president is spending money.      I'm not sure you really want the last two years explained to you, but since you asked, here goes:  Congress passed quite a lot of legislation at the beginning of their term.  Bush vetoed twelve pieces of legislation that congress attempted to pass (actually eleven--due to a clerical error, he had to veto the same bill twice).  That Congress was elected to stand up to Bush.  If Bush isn't willing to go along with what the people elected Congress to do, then nothing was going to get done until he was out.  That's what the people voted for--how do you make the argument that the party just elected is stopping the party that was ousted from doing the will of the people--it just doesn't make sense.      I'm afraid it is you who needs to put down the 8th grade civics book and look at facts.  The president is absolutely capable of making law without congress.  Here's a list of Bush's executive orders:  http://www.archives.gov/federal-register...  In addition, he has control over the government agencies--if he chooses to tell a department or agency to stop doing their job, they won't do it, no matter what Congress told them:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...|`|4Vmlf902aa	Powers are balanced between them. So one branch can't overpower the other.      But you could say Congress is more powerful. Congress can declare war, create laws, impeach the president, etc. While the President can only say veto laws, etc. The President can't remove someone from Congress.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	The President.     The constitution puts a lot of limits on what congress can do, but puts almost no limits on the President. And Bush, really pushed the limits with his presidential orders and signing statements.    Plus, while Congress passes laws, they cannot do a thing to execute them. That is totally up to the President and the Executive Branch.|`|Imy6crjqaa	There is something called "Separation of Powers" that gives them equal amount of power in situations! Lobbying and filibusters contribute to some of the mistakes and Bush was allowed to do some things without Congress, the exceptions are in the Constitution and if Government books, look it up if you want to know more.The Bush Administration and his advisors as a whole messed up and did not estimate or plan some things as thoroughly as they should have, but the president has ultimate control, look at all of his duties, (Commander in Chief etc.)|`|AMCuX8XPaa	You haven't followed the harm Bush did to our public lands, abortion rights and a whole bunch of other stuff in the last few weeks of his stupid, useless presidency?    The president is very concentrated power.  He sets the whole tone of the country - and the tone for Bush was "What's the dumbest thing we can do at this time????"

6sz5UoQ8aa	work.      and letting people keep more of the money they earn by working then they have more money to spend.|`|V74QiNi3aa	This might work.  Here is part of the plan thought of, but the government does not want to listen to history or to someone who has experiences in dealing with problems.    A) Scrape the present taxation system completely, and create a flat tax of 17.5% across the board regardless of income. This would create an increase of take home money to the people of about 55.5%  B) Ask all Canadians to accept a wage and salary freeze for a period of 3 years @ 2008 levels. (Except for politicians who truly care for this country and its people. see next point)  C) Politician should be willing to be leaders in tackling this problem since they are part of the solution/issue.  - Therefore they should take a pay cut of 34%. This would release Millions of dollars to be re-allocated.  - Also, thier pension plans should fall in line with the guidline of the average Canadian based on the Maxium allowable under the Canada Pension Plan.  - The removal of the 8 year clause for quailifing for full pension.  D) implement a reward or penality system in regards to business/corporations as follows:  Reward - no taxes to be applied up to an amount of $1 Billion of Gross profits if 25% of that amount is re-invested in Canada only (not oversea ventures). This would help create jobs, build infrastrues, broaden employment, educate workers, and help stimulate the economy of the future. (ie: expansions, r&d, new products, new program.) This also allows companies the pride of giving back to this country.  Penality - 32% tax for any amount of money sent out of this country. This helps Canada because it is compensation for lost of present and future revenue. (ie: jobs lost or not created)  To help equal out the playing field pass legislation to cap the gross mark-up/profit margins of selling goods 35.3%. This would create a competitive field for better quality and workmanship. Because the present taxation system would be scraped there would not be a manufacturing tax, HST, GST or PST.  In regards to Provincial/Federal Crown Corporations they must follow the guidline just like everyone else.    For students who recieve loans allow them the same amount of time to pay back the loan as it took them to get into debt interest free  ie: if they borrowed for 5 year then allow them 5 years to pay it all back. Any outstanding balance after their interest free period, would then become due or interest will be added to that balance at prime + 1.5%|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	Let the economy reset on its own. We keep trying to push up those that are failing when all that does is delay the inevitable.  Let the bad companies fail and disappear. There's a reason that they aren't succeeding and giving them free money doesn't fix that problem. Let them disappear so that a properly run company can step up to fill the void.    No one said it would be easy, but that is the only way to get the country back on track.|`|flU2gf54aa	Restructure, reorganize, mergers and acquisitions. If they fail, they fail.

296b3ddd20aa6b7c48fb40d2c187aedfaa	Capitalism is deception about ownership of companies.    There are all new companies, stores, restaurants, and banks every 4 years and an average employment duration of 1 year within false economics capitalism, (that is possibly a secret homelessness-without-health insurance death camp). Remaining solvent does not actually exist within false economics capitalism.    Get rich quick schemes in the capitalist business world, (buyouts, IPOs, conglomerates, acquisitions, mergers, and the stock market), do not actually work. Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).    Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.    Capitalism is the psychology of imaginary parents, false economics, and the criminal deception of employees that are paying the bills (including the stocks and bonds, or shares) of companies.|`|AA11473885	It's about to turn into Socialism.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Our country, the U.S. has not been capitalist for years.

Now we're faced with two choices: Socialism- as offered by the democrats or Feudalism as offered by the republicans.|`|62OGLZfpaa	true capitalism would fail.

The biggest, most musclier guy would beat up an rob the other 9   and you'd have one king, alone, with no one to trade with and then they system would fail.       So, no, it's not "true capitalism" as pure anything doesn't exist on earth.  There's no such thing as 'pure gold', but goal that is near perfect and the same could be said about an economic system.  The problem, of course with the US structure is that it's consumer driver and the consumer doesn't have enough capital to purchase everything that individual desires, so, they borrow and, eventually, the banker will come a' knockin'.      Don't get me wrong, I'm a capitalist, it is just this gross problem with lack of fiscal responsibility and sense of entitlement that's 'cause the current problem.  Meh...we're all human.

5Ho518J9aa	This morning on Morning Joe, I saw the most amazing thing. I saw Mika get pissed off over the flimsilus package! I was in utter disbelief.I've gotten to the point where I don't want to watch Fox and Friends anymore. I've always choked it down, but now I just can't take Brian Kilmeade or Gretchen Carlson. Those two morons just push me over the brink before I've even had my coffee. I think that the two shows are in a microcosm what we see with this country. The phoney baloney Republicans are just losing it, and the moderate Democrats are beginning to see the light! I've been a lifelong conservative, and I always thought that Republicans best demonstrated conservatism. Obviously, not so anymore. The consrvative Democrats are more aligned with the traditional Conservative! We don't want ANY stimulus other than putting an "Open For Business" sign over America's Golden Door. Eliminate the corporate tax for all businesses doing 100% US operations, and then when business floods money into the only decent economy left on earth, back the dollar with gold and silver, and ditch the Federal Reserve. No bailouts, no stimulus no "busy work" and for Pete's sake, no garbage pork stuffed into an emergency plan that won't do JACK to save a hotdog stand, nevermind an economy!|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	The majority of those who voted for Obama will share with him a perpetual honeymoon for however long he's in office.

It's too late to hide from the public the fact that the first half of the money was misdirected.  And most people are smart enought to know politicians don't do that by accident; it's about cronyism and power.    Consider something about the vote the other day.  100% of House Republicans voted against the stimulus package.  Sometimes obstructionism works TEMPORARILY for the better.  It may very well be a good thing the original plan didn't pass.  BUT - 100% votes don't happen because it's natural and it just happens.

For example in California, the police standards can be found at www.post.ca.gov  P.O.S.T. does say that to meet the minimum requirements you have to have a California high school diploma, G.E.D. or High School equivalency exam certificate. If you were home schooled you would have to show proof that you meet the minimum qualifications for graduation and it is certified by a governing agency approved of by the commission on police standards in your state/area.

I do have to wonder, though....why the heck is he willing to fund abortions for women in foreign countries when his own country is trillions of dollars in debt?? WTH? What are his priorities?

They say that the patience pays and I wish that the saying is true.|`|eNVSrvcLaa	I am not american but when I first read of Obama's plan to spend money funding abortions in underdeveloped countries, I could not help but feel disgruntled by this move. I am against abortion for any reason other than if it poses  a danger to the mother's life, but leaving that aside, I was against the idea for a couple of reasons:  First, although I am a supporter of charitable work, I feel that charity begins at home. American people are losing their jobs, their homes and you want to be charitable (if you want to call it that) to people in another country? Solve your own problems first.  Second even if there were no economic problems and everybody was well off, I still do not feel that it is the job of any government to fund abortions. This is not something that taxpayers money should be spent on. If there are individuals who believe in this cause, then they can set up an organisation collecting money from like minded individuals who care for this issue.    Other than this issue, I feel that Obama seems to be doing fine. I like the idea that he froze the salaries of highly paid aides in the white house. He has my respect for that.    EDIT: regarding suing companies for difference in pay due to discrimination, I do not know if this extension would make a difference. Salaries are a hush hush issue and I don't know how open people are to disclosing their salaries, which explains why this woman never found out till it was too late.
g2mrLqmeaa	I used to watch The Fifth Estate on CBC years ago... does that count?  It was like a Canadian version of the US news program 60 minutes.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	The 4th Estate is stronger than ever; it put President Obama in office.    Only with the 4th Estate could the Democrats successfully call the Republicans "obstructionists" for voting to block the bailouts, then turn around and blame them on the Republicans when the damn things became unpopular.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	Yes the web is the last place to get real news unfiltered from corporate interests.

Lk4aCBACaa	One, if it started right when they took office, how exactly did they cause it? If that's when it started, then logic suggests it must be conditions prior to that point that caused the problem. Two, many of the things they wanted to do to help the economy were either blocked by the Republicans (the Democrat majority was very slim until this most recent election) or vetoed (or threatened with veto) by Bush.    Unlike some on the Left, I do agree that the Democrats in the House & Senate should be doing a lot more. They have enough of a majority now to get things done, and they're still bending over backwards to keep the Republicans happy. Sorry to say but the market was never more "free" than under 8 years of Bush & Co., and what we're seeing now is the result of that. Big business was allowed to pretty much get away with murder: tax cuts and/or loopholes, paying themselves 500-600 times more than their workers, corruption, etc. Worker productivity has never been higher, yet wages have been pitiful, and now you're lucky if you even have a job.    This is what happens when you give all the money to those at the top: they *don't* create jobs unless it's minimum wage retail jobs, and the money they get in tax breaks does *not* trickle down. The economy will stay broken until everyone in power in this country realizes one very important thing: making sure the low and middle income brackets are making what they deserve is the only way things are going to get better. That means enforcing a living wage for full-time workers, creating of jobs that will pay it, and putting realistic caps on executive pay/perks. Until the politicians have the sense and/or balls to do that, we're pretty much screwed.    The rest of us outnumber the rich by a substantial degree: if we can't afford to buy stuff to even meet our basic needs, then the economy is just going to continue to tank.|`|m7crO0phaa	if you ask me, it is too late ! poor democrats have to fix so much stuff !|`|AA10899266	I gave up on politics after Reagan got elected.|`|ZphAhwy6aa	YES BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE SO AMERICAN...I DON'T THINK EITHER PARTY HAS A BRAIN RIGHT NOW.THE HOUSING MARKET GOT WAY OUT OF CONTROL AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THIS WHOLE MESS.NAFTA AND GAT BOTH MAJOR ISSUES TO.MOST OF THE TOP ECONOMICS SAY AS OF DECEMBER WE ARE IN A DEPRESSION....BUT LIKE BEFORE IT IS NOT ALL OVER THE NEWS YET...AMERICA NEEDS TO WAKE UP.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Do you know or understand anything about economics? It did not happen overnight or in 2 years. It does not happen like that. Republican - Conservative policies are failed policies. Look at the facts. It's true even conservatives like John W.

Typical republican b.s. trying not to take fault for anything.|`|zbAKxm0daa	This recession had been in the works since at least 2001, when Bush began his excessive warmongering.      When we saw the record surplus disappear within the first few months and become a record deficit and government corruption go unabated, this recession was already predictable.  That was when the Republican neocons ran the House, the Senate and the White House.    The recession started right after 9-11, when people suddenly began spending less, out of fear.  It continued as US businesses began firing people to ship their jobs overseas and lending institutions began to get deregulated and lending laws became under-enforced.    As jobs vanished, so did people's money and banks and businesses began failing because the money to keep them running was no longer being spent by the people of this country.  It just wasn't there to be spent.    So here we are, 8 years later with a recession that everyone in power saw coming when it began and no one in power did anything to fix.    Still think that it was JUST the Democrats?

I can honestly and boldly say the President Bush had to deal with the worst situation the United States faced.     He was faced with the worst terrorist attack on American soil in recent US history, and most of the actions he took were in part, beneficial to the US. Imagine an Iraq (in fact, a world) with Saddam Hussein!    He's probably been very bad, according to the domestic-oriented American public but on the international front, I don't think he's been the worst.|`|bzNjJbzQaa	He was very incompetent and deceiver.

We may never recover from the damage Carter and his policies did to America.      The true test is not to compare Bush to Clinton, who had it easy, but to ask yourself how the other guy would have done in his place. If faced with the same challenges as Bush how would Gore or Kerry have done in his shoes?  How secure would we have been under Gore after 9/11, would Kerry have been able to save the economy? Those are the questions you need to ask.
Ry61ViNZaa	The extreme left bashes her because they are afraid of her.    She is a successful working Mother and talks about personal responsibility and that is what the left hates.    The left wants to create a nanny state where you live by the mantra that you are a victim.  That way they can control you with government programs and keep you enslaved.    I feel that she was solely defeated by the press.  Things were made up and they put out half truths and rumors as news to do what they could to diminish and erode her both personally and professionally.    I don't know if I would vote for her, but I saw hope in the eyes of Traditional Conservatives when she entered the race.

I hate her voice and can't stand to hear her talk.    As for politically I don't feel she has a clue about anything going on outside of Alaska. As much as Alaska is part of the US life there is so different then life here and I don't think she understands it. Even though she will have 4 years to run I don't think that will be enough time for her to understand us.    I voted for Bush 2 times and I am proud of it but lately the Republican party has nothing in it for regular people. It has become a party of hate and intolerence.     I would never vote for her based on those reasons.|`|YKPN1444aa	Libs attack out of extreme fear of her.|`|QC94lBXOaa	I would not vote for her in 2012 because I do not agree with her stand on most issues.

She is not a phoney, and that makes the phonies really mad.  I was a democrat, and now I'm independent, but I would vote for Sarah in a hearbeat.    My reasons:    She is very intelligent and articulate while Katie C. is just a piece of fluff.  I can't understand why anyone would think Sarah was wrong for being aggravated at Katie's stupid questions about reading newspapers.    Rumors are that Sarah has no education.  Actually she has a degree in Journalism from Idaho University.    Rumors are that Sarah bought Alaskans with mineral royalties.  Another myth.  Alaskans have shared in mineral royalties for years and years.  I've know they did for at least 20 years.  Plus Alaska has no state sales taxes.    Rumors are that Sarah has no experience.  Actually, she started her political career with a School Board position, then went on to Mayor, then she was appointed as Energy Commissioner by an Alaskan governor.  Then she ran for governor and won.    I am pro-choice, but it doesn't bother me that she is not.  I think a lot of women hate her (and I know some) because she does not believe in abortions.   Well, if one is pro-choice they should believe that she has a "choice" also.    So many lies were printed in magazines, on blogs, and newspapers, television shows, it was shameful.  They lied about her, and her family.    There are many, many reasons I would vote for her, but the main one doesn't have to do with her education, experience, abortion position.  It is simply that she has shown she is a good leader, and a good steward of Alaskans monies.     She will be president at some point.|`|f8316b851202bfa29e2b37b5add98d36aa	I think most of the reason for the hatred of Sarah Palin is the vitriol poured upon her by the media, who could not allow a woman to show well, especially against the Obamination.  For myself, though I would want to know if there were more to her than we were shown, but I would not be averse from voting for her in 2012, depending upon her platform and running mate.  Certainly, I am not stupid enough to vote either for or against someone based solely upon what the MSM says about them.  Those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it.

Pelosi is an embarrassment to America, congress, and to the Italian people.    However when taxpayers are asked to bailout failing corporations then excessive executive compensation and perks should be put on hold.

HLHHM4Mtaa	You're asking a liberal to explain something that they don't understand.  There are a number of States that have no income tax.  My state, Texas, is one of them and doing exceptionally well fiscally.  Our economy is among the best (if not THE best) in the nation.  We have the most Fortune 500 companies of any state and in a recent one year period 7 out of 10 new jobs created in America were created in Texas (Texas State of the State address by Gov. Rick Perry two days ago).  ...and it has all been brought about by conservative management (both democrat and republican) of our resources.  It can also be done on the federal level and without a federal income tax, but it can't be done with liberals in control.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	People can live their own lives AND pay taxes.

Do you honestly think income tax is the only thing that keeps our government running?"    Hogwash.

It would be silly to apply the pro-life label to taxes.  Keep it in context.  As far as why I am pro-choice, it is because I think pregnancy/birth control/abortion/etc is between the pregnant woman and her doctor, if she chooses.  I don't enter the equation.    I answered your question.  Just because you don't like my answer and you have deemed it "not intelligent" does not make it any less of a direct answer to your direct question.  You are painting in too broad of strokes with your either/or logical fallacy.  The answers you get are a result of the nature of the question.|`|HisTVeOXaa	No because pro-choice only refers to fetuses.    If you want to secede from the country, then go ahead.

You also have the freedom to vote politicians who decide how much tax to take. If you do not like that, convince your fellow voters to vote for those want fewer taxes. If you cannot convince your politicians by voting and free speech to tax less, then democracy does not work for you. However, the other choices are worse.     Also, analogy is flawed. Because you enjoy public goods like defense and street lights, the public entity that provides those things has a right to tax you. Again, your only hope to convince politicians and voters to say I want less public goods. Good luck on that.    Edit.

Us libertarians believe in taxes because it's a necassary evil, it's not right for the government to take anything, but we entrust certain responsabilities to the government with restrictions to only do what we can't do for ourselves.  Social Liberals believe in  taxes because to them people are entitled to other people's money and property, because they believe in a different kind of equality that I like to call the equal pie theory.  They believe that there is only so much success or wealth in the world and since it's limited, the only compasionate thing to do is put someone in charge to take it all from everyone and redistribute it so that everyone can have an equal share of the pie.  That's why you hear Obama say he wants things more equal.  We believe success is what you make it and equality is everyone having the same opportunity to work for what they want.  Thats why this is the greatest nation on earth, because you can be anything you want to be if you work at it.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Do you want an army?  police, roads, bridges??

It will decrease the likelihood that employers will hire women.  It will increase the likelihood that employers will slowly lower the pay of men for the SOLE reason to equalize pay without regard to experience or good work habits of the men.    As a woman who works in a prominently male-occupation, this will hurt me rather than help me. The reason there are so few women in my trade is not due to their gender but rather the mandatory overtime, hot and dirty working conditions and the fact that burns are common. Lifting of up to 100 pounds is not uncommon and at times the tooling is 350 degrees. Many women simply aren't interested.    Now, employers will be shy about hiring me because they're afraid that I'll sue them. Great. I already get paid well for my experience but now it's going to be harder for me to get in the door.

AA11209233	No, it isn't disrespectful.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with criticizing the president, saying you can do better, or announcing your intent to run.  The only reason this is worrysome is that the last presidential campaign lasted way too long--it shouldn't take two years of campaigning, and if another republican opponent announces an intent to run soon, it will be as drawn out as the Hillary/Barrack battle.  I hope she runs in 2012--I hope she wins the nomination.  If she does,  Obama is sure to get re-elected.  Ron Paul has a better chance than she does.  I think the republicans would be best served by someone else--neither of them is going to unite or define the party.    While it may be partly her role as the vice presidential candidate, you didn't hear a lot of substance come out of her mouth during the campaign.  She had a lot of the "I'm just like you" hockey-mom fluff, a lot of critisism of Obama and the Democrats, and an incredible ability to turn any subject back to core american values.  If she puts together a real platform of change to conservative values, she may be worth voting for.  If she thinks everyone will vote for her because she seems likeable and gives lip service to conservative values, it's not going to happen.|`|sVbZEWveaa	I dont think that is disrespect.

She just ran a campaign against Obama, and spent several months telling us why he was wrong for the office. Why should she stop? Philosophically, they are polar opposites.

Besides,the democrats could write election laws that would all but eliminate any political opposition or come up with some excuse to declare martial law that would suspend the constitution and make Obama the "King" of the United States.   That could keep him in office for as long as he wants.     I still don't consider him to be the legitimate president since he still has not proven that he is a natural born U.S. citizen and has rejected all requests for such proof and has spent $180,000.00 (at last report) in legal fees to keep all his records from public scrutiny.

As far  as others disrespecting him, they are racist, because  they have no other reason to show him disrespect, he has not done anything  yet to cause animosity or disrespect. He has only been in office 2 weeks, so for people to talk trash already shows ignorance on their part as far as I am concerned. If he does something untoward at  some point then they have the right to speak out , but this early they should at least give him the benefit to do his job without  ridicule, until it is  deserved*

Illegal immigrants' value to economy? $1.8 trillion    If the 8.1 million undocumented immigrants who cut lawns, bus tables and perform other jobs disappeared overnight, the nation's economy would lose nearly $1.8 trillion in annual spending.

These are just some of the findings from a study done by the Perryman Group, a Waco-based economic analysis firm, whose work was commissioned by Americans for Immigration Reform, a group spearheaded by the Greater Houston Partnership.

The census is primarily to ensure that every 10 years, the district maps get redrawn to account for population shifts.  In a democratic republic, it's vitally important to ensure that the proper representation happens.  There are only 435 seats in the House.  That means each one of them represents approximately 666,667 people each in 2009.

A lot depends on the magistrate who hears the case but I think he would be very unlucky to get a custodial sentence if it is a first offence.  A fine and/or probation is the most likely sentence.  It is  though always possible he could get up to a couple of years if he is unlucky enough to come up before a very anti all drugs magistrate.

When this comes back and bites the libs they won't be able to blame repubs.|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	yea? well eh we had 8yrs of bush tax cuts.. idc if its a 3 billion dollar stimulus as long as we get the economy back in order..     QQ the GOP is fail.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	obama has compromised...something W never did.    he asked Pelosi to remove the contraceptive part of the bill and she did...remember this was not Obama's bill...|`|97VqHCIRaa	Its called bi-partisanship.    You probably haven't heard that in 8 years...|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Congrats to the bipartisan opposition to the stimulus/porkorama montrosity.|`|9VaWal2Daa	that's wrong and you know it.     He went to the House and spoke with the Republicans and took things out they objected bitterly to, and added some stuff they wanted.  He didn't HAVE to do that.  He at least TRIED to appease them.     And his was reward was not an OUNCE of support.     Not a single solitary vote, by a single republican.     He got BUMPKUS!   GOOSE EGG!!!!!! NADA!!  NOTHING!      not even a TOKEN show of support, by some old fart NOT up for re-election............NOTHING.     Yeah........the republicans.........saviors our tax dollars........    that's why they passed that 750 billion bailout pork barrel spending spree to rich bankers.     because they are soooooooooooooooooooo concerned about the TAX PAYER.    Pullllll-eseeeeeee-----------|`|V44ARW4maa	i dispute your "obama would not compromise" statement. By the news i heard, obama eliminated several items to appease the right--the repair of the national mall in D.C., increasing the tax cut and axing some health related programs. All that said, you appear to be the typical republican by saying "the gop wanted to help". Obviously you are wrong as not one republican voted for the bill. You wonder why there is so much acrimony in washington and this is a perfect example--the right has their own agenda and it's plain THEY are the ones who "refuse to compromise". As a registered  independent, i find the gop to be obstructionists and in the long run, hurt america. Obama tried to reach out to the right and got his face slapped. Were i to advise him, i would simply say "treat the gop the same way they treated the left when they were in control back in the 90's--ignore them". The right demanded more in tax cuts and will then turn around and complain obama is doing nothing to stimulate the economy. So with little money, just how is he supposed to accomplish this? The right's refusal to accept any responsibility for the mess this country is in is reprehensible and i am confident history will place the blame exactly where it belongs: at the feet of boy george and his deregulation in both the financial markets and the oil industry.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Since when has Obama taken any of the blame for anything? All this so-called stimulus will do is delay the inevitable and when the now much bigger crash comes anyway he's already got his response practiced to the max...     "IT'S ALL BUSHES FAULT".|`|DfK4JSytaa	Yes, he wants to say exactly that, a couple of months or a year down the road.|`|AA11297448	I'm glad the Repubs went against him. When the plan fails, they'll have clean hands.|`|kdvy8Woqaa	No he's trying to be bipartisan.    If this stimulus package is even slightly successful or even if it stabilizes the unemployment rate, the Republicans are screwed.    Even economists are saying the stimulus package will help the economy.  http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics...  http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/stor...|`|vFGojyBHaa	Glad to see the Republican reps grew a pair and voted on principle.  For those that poo-poo the Bush tax cuts, if the tax cuts had not been in place, the recovery of the economy post-9/11 would have never happened.|`|RFEorR5Raa	one has to ask why is Obama so adamant to bring republicans on board to his stimulus plan as he has enough votes to pass it without them.    think of the amazing PR they will get if it succeeds.  people will sing their praises for years and this would assure them of elections for   years to come.    many of us agree that the Dem's know this will fail to do what they have told us it will do and do not want to take the blame alone.  they want to say that it was a bipartisan plan so all must share in the blame.      i am proud that all republicans and 11 dems in the HOUSE voted NO!  'This "porkulus" bill is designed to repair the Democratic Party's power losses from the 1990s forward, and to cement the party's majority power for decades.'|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Democrat Control of all government is a disaster.  I would much rather have the Rep.  in control of senate or a rep in the white house but I voted for Obama based on what I believe in.  Right now its just gonna be Democrates make a bill, pass it and Obama sign away.  The checks and balance of this is GONE. Although I personally believe we were screwed whether McCain or Obama made it in.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I wouldn't vote for that wasteful stimulus package either.|`|r9brDDtBaa	In the senate, if you don't have 60 votes, it can be very difficult to pass a vote.  You republicans really don't know much about politics though, so there's really no point in answering this question.|`|lrMCiDnraa	When more that 50% of the stimulus package is not going to be spent until many years from now and only 8% is going to be used this year this is not a stimulus package but the democrats getting to spend money on what they want. Didn't the Republicans loss because of stuff like this?  Either way this is Obamas baby and if it does fail it will follow Obama though out his presidency.|`|AA11665632	No, I believe he has been reaching out in a bipartisan fashion; as he said he would. If you have noticed, Obama has not singled out one party or the other in blame, all throughout his campaign. He even quoted, "There is plenty of blame to go around". He is not slinging it around. That seems to be what extreme conservatives/liberals are doing, and in doing so, excepting no blame whatsoever. Interesting isn't it?|`|9bgBIzjFaa	You nailed it.  He could care less about their support. He only wants it so that when it fails Republicans can't say "I told you so"|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Obama is indeed trying to share the blame, just as Clinton tried with his initial programs.  Just as Clinton knew his budget would cause a recession, Obama knows his "stimulus package" will deepen and prolong the one we have now. It's not a secret dark art, it's simple history. It's ALL been done so we already KNOW the result. It WILL harm the economy and Obama knows it. That is simply not a debatable point even if Obama hadn't said so himself - which he did.  Obama hoped to avoid what Clinton faced - the near-impossibility of blaming Republicans.    Obama has NOT compromised...he asked Pelosi to remove the contraceptive part of the bill because a strong majority of DEMOCRATS opposed it. "W never did" is simply a VERY retarded statement. The Bush/DNC agreement rate was around 85%. He actually did their bidding much, much MORE than what his own voters prefered.    If this "stimulus package" is successful America is screwed. Obama told us ON TV he intends to spread DEPENDENCE. It's SUPPOSED to hurt the economy so you'll hold out your hand to Obama for sustenance. It will stabilize the unemployment rate, . . . in double-digits.    A perfect illustration of Democrat "logic:"  Democrat Control of all government is a disaster. . . . I voted for (Democrat Control of all government)|`|8ad6fQiNaa	Obama wouldn't compromise? He's told them he'll accept revisions to his plan, he actually has already revised it to accept more of their ideas, and yet the voted against it. Exactly how far is he supposed to bend?|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	All he is doing is looking for a scapegoat - just in case.  Or, as the case maybe, in any case.|`|YY24gmRpaa	If you think the last few years were bad just wait.  It will not be long before all you ob fans will be wishing for the good old Bush days.

1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Funny how someone will say that when has someone from the working class ever gave you a job.    These are the people I want working for me. I will pay them a lot less of what they're worth and make them work longer hours while I reap the benefits.  And if they don't like it, I'll get someone else.   I don't care how much education you have, I will pay you as little as possible.

587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Both parties' leadership is more liberal than their voters.  Among elected party "officials" Democrats are monolithic and it is literally impossible to be on their left. Almost none of their voters are on their side on just about any issue so I honestly don't see how they could ever win an election if people were better informed.  Republicans range from originalist to nearly as liberal as the DNC leadership and the elected Republicans reflect that.  For the 2 major parties your options are basically "extreme left" and "everyone else" since even 95% agreement with the DNC leadership gets you thrown out of the DNC but NOT out of the RNC.  Example: Majorities of Democrat voters, Republican voters and elected Republicans would not allow foreign nationals to remain in this country illegally and without documentation but all elected Democrats disagree.|`|VDgAJETtaa	The liberal and moderate wings of the Democratic party are more closely aligned than the moderate and conservative wings in the Republican party. The democratic party also allows more free thinkers, I.E, you don't have to co-sign soembody else's bullsh*t because the party tells you to.

Distracting the American middle class with red herring issues and fictitious division, so that we can continue our trickle down economics and globalism. Brilliant!

President Ahmadinejad has repeatedly gone on international television to announce that as soon as he can get his hands on nuclear weapons he will annihilate Israel.  Now, I dont know about you liberals out there, but that just seems like a bad idea to me. Talking diplomatically while allowing an admitted terrorist to get his hands on nuclear weapons so he can commit genocide against an American ally is insane, but its what weve come to expect from Democratic leadership.|`|fGE7hL12aa	I think Obama is going to be disappointed when he learns that Iran is not interested in any discussions or compromises.

tP8W6Q1Qaa	Absolutely... We as a nation no longer want to be energy dependent from foreign countries... Well if we want to stop buying our oil from other countries how else would we get the oil needed to continue our way of life??    Alaska has the second largest oil deposits after the middle east. And it is untapped. There is billions upon billions of oil under that ground.     Take the Gulf of Mexico... there are thousands of oil rigs between Texas and Florida out there... in the tune of close to 3000 rigs. Only 500 of them is ours. (USA) That oil is going to be drilled and it will come out of the ground, whether we drill it or let some one else drill, it is coming out.    We also need to develop new sources of energy that doesn't use oil, such as solar, wind, algae, nuclear etc... even when we stop using oil as a source of energy it will still be very important to us. Oil is used in making pharmaceuticals and plastic cannot be made without it and think of everything that is made from plastic.     So even when we no longer need oil to power our cars and provide energy we will need it for the building blocks and health care for the future.|`|DUGZa0Zgaa	Yes we should.  We already do and we export a lot of it.|`|MUcINsQ3aa	Yes, drill the hell out of California. They are going broke|`|HisTVeOXaa	No.  It's bad for the whales.  It would take decades to set up more oil rigs, and by that time we shouldn't even be using something as crude as oil.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	i work in the oil & gas industry and currently we are drilling for oil in the US>...    and we should drill for oil here because it keeps US dollars here in the US....not overseas.  At least we should until we develop alternative energy.    and tribecca we are currently not drilling those leases because they are not economic.|`|DR29KV1taa	Yes.  More domestic jobs.  Less reliance on foreign oil.  It is very safe.  It will stimulate the economy.  All around a win for everyone.  We need to expand offshore drilling too.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Yes we should. Because if you care at all about the environment it's best to drill in America where we have the toughest environmental regulations in the world. Fact is we need oil and it's got to come from somewhere and we should drill it here safely instead of polluting the earth somewhere out of sight and out of mind.|`|AA11620976	No Because all drilling will ever do is once again put off  dealing with the real solution to the problem  The only solution that can actually work long term  is to stop building energy /resource sucking suburbs and the roads that lead to them and start building new high density urban areas and use electrically powered mass transit to get people around the new and improved urban areas. There are very many old tech and new tech ways to generate electricity But damned few ways to power a car w/o a hydrocarbon based fuel  Case in Point  The island of Manhattan has the same amount of residents as the State of Nebraska does >1.7 million   The land area of Manhattan is 23 square miles  The land are of Nebraska is 77,000 square miles   Who do you think uses all available resources more efficiently ?  You may also want to check out a concept  called the" economy of scale" which basically says that the bigger things get the more efficiently they will utilize resources  BTW   Domestic drilling proponents :  Tell where it's wriiten that oil procured from domestic sources must wind up in domestic fuel tanks ?  The last time I checked  we live in a free-market economy and oil from the Gulf of Mexico could find it's way into Japanese fuel tanks as easily as it could find it's way into American fuel tanks|`|c654465d22c58a2c5b0af285003b2789aa	Yes, absolutely! If we drill more of our resources now, while pursuing alternative energy, we could be completely free of middle east oil within 10 to 20 year's as our own oil and new energy technology comes online!  What people don't realize is that were always going to need 'some' oil. So with new energy technology, our own oil production will be very limited compared to what we use today which will apease the enviroment.    We need oil to make plastic's, propane to go camping and to power my '69 Camaro! The US government cannot make anyone convert a vehicle to battery's, or whatever, even between trade of ownership but they can make you bring a building up to the current codes on a house/building if ownership changes hands.    So yes, drilling is a must but we can't think of it as if were just going to continue using the same quantity that we use now.|`|9WDontmMaa	no, don't drill for oil on homeland.  it will DESTROY "homeland"  oil is quickly becoming outdated|`|sVbZEWveaa	I say no! We need to get off oil. People need to make a commitment to get off the oil.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Yes.  The oil companies are sitting on leases of millions of acres of our public lands and efforts should be made to fully investigate why they are not drilling.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Where is your homeland? If its the USA we have been for a hundred years.    Its hilarious to read people posting that oil is outdated! Some people are amazingly ignorant of reality.|`|AA11424005	Yes.  We do drilling now.  In Titusville, PA, where the first oil well was drilled, oil is still being pumped out of the ground.  It has been going on for about 130 years.|`|zXIhB8Ycaa	but beyond drilling...we need to build more refineries.  That's the biggie.
MntRFqtHaa	I remember when I was  kid, Reagen did a good job at pulling us together after the nightmare of Carter.  We were proud, we knew we were right, Rocky fought the russian boxer and won.    But alas, some sold us out to the arab terriorist and a false lie of hope and change.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I'm 46 years old, and the states have been united my whole life.  Maybe you're hanging around the wrong people.  At the very least, you seem like a "glass half empty" kind of guy!|`|AMCuX8XPaa	Yes, after 9/11 we were united in rage and hate at shadowy "terrorists" - and we had the worst president in the history of the United States beating the drum for more hate and violence.      What's the very stupidest thing Bush could think so say at the time???  "You're either with us or against us".  Thus throwing the entire State Dept to the wolves while preparing to just attack in all directions.  What a MORON!    Yes - a good many people were united in that intensely stupid effort, but I don't bet at that point anybody really understood just how stupid Bush was - or how vile and evil Chaney was.      Between them they have left us a mess beyond reckoning.  Might be better to be a little less "united" in the future - and use our heads a little more.|`|uChLBPEtaa	What do you see as the most significant battle lines and how are they destroying our country?|`|qc2kOfm5aa	never|`|MdO6Mnpoaa	Compared to a lot of other countries, we are united. One time when I was in Spain I wore a "Proud to be an American" shirt and about fifty Spaniards and more than a few Germans asked me about it, asking if it was real. I always explained I was proud of America, even if there are some regrettable acts.|`|F5GyrdQfaa	Politics, like Religion, is a conversation one doesn't have with people one wants to be friends with, or so my grandma used to say. Now politically, we are very divided as to what each thinks is the proper Role of Government. Some say more, some say less. That is our major dividing line with regards to politics.     However, did you see the recent footage of the plane that crashed into the Hudson River? Within moments there were several boats helping the survivors (I won't use victim, as that implies intent on the part of the geese). Such scenes of Americans coming to the aid of their fellows is more common than the acidic reactions caused by politics. We are all still Americans...even if the other guy is an idiot.|`|4Vmlf902aa	We're normally United. A survey says that Americans are the most patriotic people on Earth, followed by Venezuelans. So from that you can tell most of us are united. We just drift apart,sometimes, during tough times.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	we have not been the same country since viet nam.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Wishful thinking
TxRRITveaa	i heard that if it creates all the jobs it promises it will come out to over $200k per job.     I don't mind if we use this money to rebuild or invest in infrastructure but i do not think it will create lasting jobs. if we were to invest that money into things that would help us in the long run, like "nukular" power plants or wind turbines, it would at least pay for itself in the long run.|`|atbAakXuaa	It will enable the CEOs to get the huge bonuses they lust for.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	It will HELP the DEMOCRATS...that is all they care about.....|`|xxDjV6Axaa	It will help us get more into debt.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Fewer and fewer think so. And certainly very few economists  from either party.    The Congressional Budget Office says there's almost no "stimulus" in it as most of the benefit of that unbelievable amount of money will occur in 3 to 10 years.    This "stimulus" is apparently designed to pay off Dem interest groups with just enough left over for real stimulus (read: tax cuts for small business  which is where new jobs are created in this economy) to get Reps to vote for it.    So far, Barry-O is batting zero on getting Reps to buy into this charade. Gee, after all those years that the Dems were babbling about how they wanted a balanced budget (yeah, sure you did!), isn't it interesting to see what they REALLY wanted.|`|VWLCwLNMaa	Globalism. You can't live with it.    Our industries have been trickled down to China. Now we have one way trade with them and the oil producing nations. We don't produce anything to export.    Trickle down economics in the age of globalism. Brilliant!    Borrowing money from China, so that we can purchase Chinese goods and end up owing them for stimulating their economy. Priceless!    True capitalism is dead in the USA. Now we have two choices. Socialism: As offered by the democrats. Feudalism:As offered by the republicans.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	The stimulus/porkorama bill will hasten the downfall of America.  This is Obama's real goal.|`|681HoxMjaa	NO, This is just a game he's playing with us. First only 90 bil, is going to infrastructure, by the time it gets to the people it will only be about 5 bil, you have eng, cost, city and state inspectors, permit cost. the we have to count on the 50% falling in line with the good ol boy game. This will do nothing. I think the amount of PORK in this itself is just a joke. some states will get big bucks. Money to global warming isn't going to do anything for us right now, but, AL GORE will make billions of it. I think we need to look at it but if these pork items are important then pass them on there on bill and not on a bill called stimulus for the people flipping the big BILL.|`|Kp46I3W4aa	who knows?
g2R7e2eVaa	YES, you are a traitor if you hope the leader of our country fails. I am a conservative but I hope Obama nothing but the best. My success in life depends partly on his in office.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	Obama's proposals so far are terrible, so I hope they fail.  You can call me whatever name you want; I certainly don't care about that.  Name calling does not change the facts about Obama's proposals.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	I hope he fails at several things... I hope he fails at implementing national health care, I hope he fails at "spreading the wealth" and I hope he fails at moving this country closer to a socialist state.....  Just because he is Commander in Chief doesn't mean I have to agree with everything that he wants.|`|xLqMubuBaa	Put that jacket on my back.A real foolish choice by foolish voters.  My head hurts from always being right !|`|rWdYBmPmaa	No. I hope his policies fail. And they will.     This 800billion is just the start of what the dems are planning for America.And it is not good.|`|J74Y5LKxaa	Yes he is the Commander In Chief. And like Clinton, he has absolutely ZERO military experience.  Imagine if Microsoft, IBM, Dell, or Coca Cola were to hire a CEO with absolutely ZERO experience.  What would the shareholders say!|`|d43a9e27bec523580938e169288062ffaa	Traitor?  no.  Anti-American? yes.        Hoping that Obama fails to get his policies implemented, however, is neither since those policies would hurt the country.|`|g5FbtzNTaa	When I woke up this morning the U.S.A was still for the most part a republic. We haven't officially declared it the U.S.S.A. yet. As long as it remains a republic, I have every right to disagree with out of control spending and unsuccessful policies. Don't confuse respect for the office and opposing socialist values for being unpatriotic. Don't marry the two together either, just to shed the guilt. The President is Commander and Chief of the military NOT my personal life. I'm not in the military so all I have to do is respect the office of Presidency, not his policies.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	If I believe that his policies are bad for this country, am I a traitor to support him?|`|jNfWCVMHaa	Freedom of Speech, I can say whatever I want, when I want.    Just look at the media.|`|AA10142580	I don't hope any president fails! Including Obama!  I pray for his safety, and that his guidance comes from God!|`|N5pPJUS8aa	I don't think you are a traitor, anymore then I thought people who were against Bush were traitors.    Funny how the right considers themselves 'Christians', yet their hypocrisy knows no bounds.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	He's not my commander in chief. I'm not in the military you idiot. So if I don't like socialist policies, taking money away from people to give it to other people...then I'm a traitor?    You're the traitor, wake up. Obama's spending orgy is full of pork. He said there would be "no pork spending".    Pork pork pork. Dems are full of crap and so is Obama.|`|V0uzsE6kaa	No, you aren't really a traitor.  But it would be silly to hope your president fails since he controls the future of our nation and his failure would directly effect you and your family.|`|pWA3gybAaa	I don't hope he fails, I know he will, his plan makes no sense, borrowing is what got our country in trouble so  now he wants to borrow even more and own Private industry, its almost like Communism that is why Ford did not take any government money becuz once you take it the government dictates to you on how to run a business, we know how good government is at running things|`|xkcLOfTKaa	If his plan is to bypass the Constitution, destroy federalism, and completely revoke the rights of states to govern themselves... HE is a traitor to the PEOPLE of the Unites States, and I would hope ALL responsible citizens would want him to fail...    If, however he plans on restoring free markets, returning industry to the hands of private citizens and uphold and defend the Constitution, then I hope with all my heart he succeeds.|`|5hxWSezPaa	I doubt it.  And I doubt that anyone is hoping Obama fails.  The question arises in the fact that people define failure and success differently when referring to Obama.   The more socialist programs he creates the bigger failure he is in the eyes of conservatives.  Whereas, libs call him a success.|`|AA12070828	I agree... but also, if you think Obama will succeed because he is the first black president then you are a fool.|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Do I hope Obama fails? Of course not!  He is our President.  Do I think he is infallible and has all the right answers?  Of course not!  I hope Obama succeeds at bringing the Country together.  I hope he makes wise choices, I hope he keeps us safe from terrorists, I hope he has the courage to manage Pelosi & Reid who feel superior to him and will defy him to push their own agenda.    To describe anyone who disagrees with anyone to be an unthinking, uneducated robot.  If the shoe fits............wear it to your own detriment!|`|ad3de03ebb84f041fee9ea982e0b33c5aa	It is not a matter of us hoping he fails, as that would not do us any good.  I guess for what is  he has on his plate and what he has attempted to accomplish so far is scaring the crap out of alot of people.  I agree with the guy that said "am I a traitor to support him since he does not believe in his policies? Amen, He said it the best.  Vote his answer the best.|`|jHDc6Rwmaa	No, you are incorrect. If I hope he fails, I am merely standing up for my beliefs. Why is unpatriotic to hope that he fails if him succeeding means that live, and born babies are murdered legally. If I think that that is a gross infringement on the right to life and that it is unconstitutional, then it is my duty to hope that he fails.     If Obama succeeding means that there will be a mandatory socialized health care, and I believe socialized health care in any for to be against the very document that started this free nation, then is it not my call to hope that he fails.     If the Commander and Chief does not stand up for the rights of people living under tyranny and threat of death simply because they are not U.S. citizens when our founding fathers wrote that we have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and that these are self evident, does that not mean that they are universal, that we have done nothing to deserve them but to live and breathe and be human? Why then would I back down and accept what my country is becoming.|`|QOgorEJGaa	Yes.   I don't hope he fails, but the situation is looking pretty miserable, and I don't  believe he has the smarts to fix it.  It would take someone like Bill Clinton with his IQ of 185 to fix it, if it can be fixed.  I don't think it can.   We are in for deep depression, job losses are escalalting, the snowball effect is happening.  I didn't vote for Obama, because I was thinking of the best for all Americans and who would be best, so I didn't vote for either McCain or Obama.  I don't think McCain really wanted the job after the banks quit lending, he seemed pretty disinterested to me.   That is because with his experience he knew we were in a jam that he nor anyone else can fix.    Obama right now is throwing good money after bad, and it is money we don't even have.  As Ron Paul said this morning, we will either "borrow" the money, or "print" up some money, and that is not good.   But to hope a president fails is to hope the nation goes under, and that is not my wish, but what I fear.    Also, he is only Commander in Chief as long as we are at war.   So he will keep us at war, when we need that money at home.   Try calling him president.   They love wars so they can be called Commander in Chief, don't you know.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	yes i agree . the iddiots that wish he fails , are only wishing for hardsips to be brought on themselves.  it could be that they are so conditiond to having a failure in office the last 8 years that they just want more of the same.|`|m5J36D28aa	Sore losers have no concern for our country.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	nope seeking to make him fail would make you traitor, you can think and hope whatever you damn well please in this country.|`|9qKAy0dlaa	When Rush said that I knew immediately why Bush was so bad.|`|JLayHNZCaa	I don't know if technically you are a traitor, mentally ill, yep, I would say that could be possible.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Nope.     So far, Obama's policy initiatives have been almost exclusively domestic and yes, I do hope those policies fail since the success of these policies would be bad for America. Increased government, obscene growth in spending, make work programs are all bad for America. Once these policies fail, they will be replaced by better policies that will acheive the desired results AND strengthen our nation. Smaller government, reduced spending, manufacturing and private sector jobs that make a profit and grow the economy all lead to a stronger America. So as long has he's headed in the wrong direction I hope he fails and fails quickly so that we can put initiatives in place that help rather than hurt our nation and our people any more.     'Commander in Chief' applies only the military, not to the people and as far as I've seen, he really doesn't have much of an Afghan/Iraq policy yet. He's sort of ignoring that which is probably a good thing given how bad his judgement has been in the past. I'll let you know whether I hope he fails once I know what that policy is. If it is a wrong policy, then yes, I will hope if fails.     So, you see, it's not that I hope HE fails. I hope his wrong headed policies fail, but not all. Only those that have been shown, historically, to be wrong.

There was a peasant before the King, and he was asked to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  The peasant said, "Okay, but it will seriously weaken my defense."    President Obama cannot have someone on the air who not only opposes him, but makes so much sense doing it.  What Obama and others do not and never will understand is that Rush isn't putting ideas in people's heads.  He is saying stuff that many people have already come to their own conclusion of, or he is the one person on the air who agrees with them.|`|61zBWVYTaa	"Dissension is the new patriotism."

Funny how libstains think that statement is exclusive to them.|`|fUdBPu01aa	Because liberals think they are the smartest people around, therefore, they believe that their opinions and views are superior to others. This rationalization is how they justify blatantly unconstitutional nonsense like the misnamed 'fairness doctrine.'    While liberals claim to love tolerance and diversity, they only like it when it fits into their pre-set template. That's why liberals are terrified of Hannity and Rush and want to shut them up.|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	He simply can not stand the fact that he is now the "President" and someone is actually disagreeing with him.  Look what he did to Joe the Plumber for asking a question he did not want to answer.  He put lots of resources into making him look bad.  Obama is not a kind and moral person.  It is like he has a chip on his shoulder.  Oh, I am sure he has his people working on the Fairness Doctrine.  If that happens then he will be a DICTATOR!!|`|AA10851908	Well it took Bush just 6 moths to take away our freedom of speech and travel.It's going to take some time to undo all that Bush did to us over the last 8 years.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Why don't you ask Obama?|`|HisTVeOXaa	Why do you refer to him as "Hussain?"

With your logic, that automatically makes all BOBS evil guys who are going to blow something up.    And to answer your question: No one likes to be contradicted.|`|xz1Ok6xraa	I have never been so scared of someone in my life.  This man is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  He is against anyone that is against his agenda.  His whole campaign was "transparency", "change", and "optimism" and he is kicking out reporters, etc... from meetings and so on.  So much for transparency.  He just told the voters what they wanted to hear.      It will be a wonderful day with me when the media falls out of love with their love child and starts criticizing him.  And I can't wait to see his reaction.  Obama has to remember he only won by 10 million votes.  Not everyone is in love with this crazy man.      If he wants to start to do away with freedom of speech, and so on, I will be wherever I have to be to fight against it.  That is the mindset that America has to get into.  If he wants to do away with OUR rights, we fight him.  If he wants to truly help out the country, we support him.|`|dc93b5548c9e41a3bba72ec5543f7879aa	President Barack Hussein Obama has nothing to fear from any radio show. Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and all the others who are anti-Obama are doing nothing but inciting FEAR and RACISM into the AMERICAN citizen, at least those STUPID enough to believe them. Instead of being a follower do your own research for the truth(whatever that may be) and come to your own conclusions.    On another note lets just keep in mind who this country really belongs too. These so called anti-Obama idiots like to think they own America, but go ask an Native American Indian how they feel about.     These so-called "christians" have never behaved like a true christian and this goes all the way back to there ancestors.|`|vAMdrpmsaa	To answer this question is to first ask Barack Hussein Obama what it is he does fear?  Is he a U.S. Marine?  Was he really born in Hawaii, if so, where is his birth certificate?  Who said Obama plans to shred the United States Constitution when he just took an oath to defend it?  Freedom of Speech issues, are you confusing this with the Bush Administration's illegal surveillance and wire tapping of American citizens?|`|iIkJN4Suaa	He can't handle the truth!    And then - he will take away our guns.|`|CfjxKLHDaa	On January 16, 2009 Limbaugh read a letter on his radio show that he had received a request from a national print outlet:... "If you could send us 400 words on your hope for the Obama presidency, we need it by Monday night, that would be ideal." He responded, "I don't need 400 words, I need four: I hope he fails."     Rush and Obama do not like each other and Rush will not stop attacking Obama.  Rush does not like liberalism and will use any fact to back himself in attacking the liberal federal government.  This includes Obama.    The liberal federal government does fear him because a lot of Americans do listen to him and Rush, along with FOX news, do vent what real Americans feel about this country.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	President Obama has nothing to fear from ranting ratbags like Limbaugh or the halfwits who hang on to his every word and believe it as if it were gospel!|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Obama doe NOT fear Rush or his show    he hates what Rush does to America     polarization and Oxycontin are rush's only true friends|`|mZi7R0Enaa	excellent but scary question!

He is limiting the press' access to meetings they have always been allowed to attend before.  He wants to control what information we receive.|`|xmQKZzAwaa	He fears the opposition. He fears the criticism. He fears the doubt that it puts in people's minds.     Obama will try to find a way to shut Rush up (I am sure he can find a loop hole since he is a lawyer in matters of the constitution). Why do I say this? Obama has threw out reporters, had one fired and refuses to talk to the press unless it is on his own terms. So much for those freedoms we all hold dear.
aV3bFchtaa	As I listen to President Obama in his first nine days he tells us how this 850 Billion must be passed immediately because we are in BIG TROUBLE (no sh*t). I remember him promising NO PORK --LINE BY LINE-- checking so there will be no pork. Well maybe someone needs to explain to our President what PORK is. Eighty percent of what is in the bill now won't be spent until after 2010, so I ask if we are in such bad shape and we need to act now, why are we acting so fast for something that does not materialize for a long time. I'll tell you why, this is payback to those that supported his campaign. These paybacks will come as SOCIAL and WELFARE programs.      Enter ACORN to claim their rewards for the buying of votes, along with VOTER FRAUD as well as helping to fix the election. What happened to ACORN?

Can you name anything in the bill that you consider pork?  Or are you just spouting something you heard on Rush's show?      I'm serious here.  What is it that is considered pork on the stimulus plan?|`|90KCAgoAaa	I have a question of my own: Do you people think you are breaking some major news story when you use only Obamas middle name? I mean yes, Hussein is his middle name. Everyone knows that. You use it alone like you think you are going to shock people.

Cn1tSHLpaa	Because this country's leaders should work together to solve the economic mess...partisan politics will do nothing but slow the process of recovery.  However, the House Republicans are much too childish, selfish and petty to want to work to do anything that would benefit the majority of Americans as opposed to their core constituents.|`|RFEorR5Raa	one has to ask why is Obama and other Dems so adamant to bring republicans on board to his stimulus plan as he has enough votes to pass it without them.    think of the amazing PR they will get if it succeeds.  people will sing their praises for years and this would assure them of elections for   years to come.  so why do the need republicans, many of us believe that the Dem's know this will fail to do what they have told us it will do and do not want to take the blame alone.    they want to be able to say that it was a bipartisan plan so all must share in the blame.  they don't want to take all the blame when it fails so they that is they are willing to share it.|`|e7ac2e63eddf35a4851ec1d1a089b183aa	They don't, and that's not a good thing.

Rush Limbaugh:  "President Obama in the meeting on Friday with House and Senate Republican leaders, Eric Cantor from Virginia in the House proposed a moderate tax cut plan. Obama said, Well, you know, "I won." I'm going to trump you on that.  We're not going to do that. Well, where's the bipartisanship, President Obama?  There is no bipartisanship in President Obama's plan.  President Obama's definition of bipartisanship is when Republicans cave and agree with his plan so he can then claim it's bipartisan.  But he's not compromising on anything here."    The Pelosi idea of bipartisan.|`|reeU4N0eaa	Because she wants to share the blame when Baracky's ill-thought out reward the bastards that supported me 'stimulus" plan fails miserably.|`|VgOCLskYaa	For one fact that the 2010 elections are going to be crucial for democrats and if the and the president fall flat on this stimulus "boondoggle" they are out the door just like 1994 and that is in the works and on top of that they still have the lowest rating of any congress in history plus 52% to 48% in the presidential election is nothing to indicate a mandate.|`|b0SC1cT9aa	Why don't we just do like Germany did in the 40's and just have a dictator would you like that?|`|qjH3Tigbaa	Because we should act only in OUR interests.  If we do that we might as well have a dictatorship in this country because there are two WAY different views and one is being ignored completly.  Obama wan't bipartisanship but her REFUSED to compromise on ANYTHING with this bill.  I voted for Obama and am still proud of it but he is breaking his bipartisan promise that he made to us.  We dont need to spend 825 billion dollars to do this stimulus we can cut taxes as well.  And there is a lot of worthless crap in this bill that needs to go.

Hmmm, I have read that somewhere before................|`|h6vOjCaPaa	No. They will negotiate. That is that thing that happens when you say. "I want something, you want something.

Negotiation is an important part of a thing called Diplomacy which is alot like "Going In and Shooting Things" except much cheaper, with words and fewer people die. Trust me on this one, its a good thing.|`|xagiOb80aa	There is no reason to surrender sovereignty when negotiating treaties.    In fact, we can improve our trade agreements etc., by insuring other nations comply with our standards.  This not only helps the environment, but subsequently makes our products and services much more globally competitive.    Free Trade is fine, but, we all need to operate within consistent rules.

In our politically correct world no politician wants to go on record mentioning that the interruption of the world's oil supply from that region would cause extreme measures by the US as well as others. It seems we try to hide from the fact that the world's economy ( already on the brink of collapse) could not survive a 25% reduction of oil. That being the case, if we leave early, chaos ensues, IRAN takes advantage of the situation, and the oil drys up, what do you think the world will do? Just say, nothing we can do and let the country sink into depression. Bottom line, if we pull out to soon, we will be right back there with a bigger mess than we currently have.|`|AA10661670	I think that it will.

There were many things that led up to both these events that started way before he took office. Similar to Obama and the economy. The terrorists were becoming more emboldened each year. They would do something and we would just let it slide. The levies in New Orleans were built when? When you live below sea level and you also live in a hurricane hotspot you have to figure something will happen sooner or later. There were over 30,000 people pulled off roofs shortly after the hurricane passed so the govt. was doing something.    What will be said if the US is attacked again, under Obama, as Biden predicted, no guaranteed we would?|`|AA12016212	turning the US into a weak-economy infected war machine isn't something any real American should want.

AA10719402	I actually agree with you on this.

Or pro-lifers who are willing to sterilize the poor against their will.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Sure you can, why would you think that all liberals think otherwise.

I care less Chubby|`|AA11963685	There is no correlation.  Sorry to be insulting but leave it to a man to think that a woman's right to make her own medical decisions equals NYC's mayor wanting salt intake reduced in his city.    EDIT:  I always do read the label and I can manage my own salt intake.  It still has zero to do with women making their own medical decisions.|`|cbDfpfYKaa	I'm pro-choice and liberal.  I don't care if restaurants change their food content.  BUT the information should be available.  People should be able to make informed decisions about their food.  Many, many of the health problems in this country are rooted in our horrible diets.|`|pNKAfY4Eaa	sure it is, if you want to eat Trans. fats, go for it.  But when restaurants are cooking their food in an unhealthy manner, and theirs an alternative as well as zero mention to the risks of trans fats on the menu, then it becomes a public matter.  especially when it's the cause of high insurance rates, large medical bills, increase to the states budget (911 call for heart attack victim at Burger King), etc.    besides, both sides are full of hypocrisy.|`|IDZTtipeaa	I do not propose we should ban trans-fats/salt.  Some do.  I can understand the difference in impacts, however, considering the effects of a diet high in transfats/salt.  The western diet leads to very high rates of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc.  These conditions put an enormous burden on our health care system, which directly affects me.  If a woman chooses to have an abortion, that is her choice and it has very little impact (ignoring psychological or religious) on me.  Again, I don't support such a proposition, but I understand the philosophy behind it.  I don't think people should eat bad foods, but I don't think it should be banned.  I don't think, in most cases, women should have abortions, but I don't think it should be outlawed.  What I don't understand is why our government indirectly/directly subsidizes the spread of these diseases, yet seems to be opposed to providing preventative treatment for everyone.  To me, that is inconsistent.|`|T2zD3FS6aa	Liberalism is not a philosophy of principles, but of expediency and emotion. Therefore inconsistencies are irrelevant.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	You're grasping at straws in trying to create inconsistencies in totally unrelated matters just so you can find a basis on which to criticize liberals. I could just as easily construct an argument that both issues are matters of public health.  Women died trying to obtain abortions when abortions were illegal. High salt contents in food contribute to bad health. I don't think Mayor Bloomberg is going to be concerned with your concocted argument.|`|bmCInR5qaa	No.  It's forced abortions and gay marriages for everyone.  But first we're going to implement socialism and the gun removal act while banning 'God' and all other religion except for Islam which we just love!      Of course after we ban Christianity (being so anti-religious and all except for Islam), we going to force churches to conduct gay marriages.    And to think, I haven't even warmed up with the right-wing delusional contradictions yet.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	You can still get foods cooked in trans-fatty acids chief.

This money given to the people will only be used to pay massive debts accumulated after which they'll find themselves in much more debt. I believe in Adam Smith's theory of the "invisible hand" which will regulate the economy in the right manner.

This isn't a Hollywood movie.|`|ad559ef88f939f9d26d9af2103d73f95aa	Why can't you all get it,that it is CONGRESS that makes and changes the laws.   Congress has power of the purse.   CONGRESS authorized funding for the war on terrorism and Iraq.   Congress changed the banking laws and removed all the protections put in place during the depression to keep it from happening again.   Congress changed the bankruptcy laws that made it harder,if not impossible,for people to file for protection or bankruptcy at the insistence of the banking lobby.   The democrats who have controlled congress for the last 2 years pushed through the bank bailout program without any accounting for how the money was spent and now they are complaining that the money wasn't spent as planned.   The latest "stimulus plan" is for another $815 Billion and another bank bailout will cost another $2 Trillion on top of everything already done.   The problem with the current plan is that most of the money will not be available until late 2010 or 2011 at best.   The democrats bankrupted the country during the Johnson administration and they think spending money we don't have is the solution.   The change Obama spoke of is simple-The government will decide everything for you.   Like a lot of other people,I'd like the government to just give me a million dollars and let me spend it.   By paying utilities and buying food,clothes,cars and other items,that money will be put back into the general economy faster than the money for building a bridge will.   Look at the number of states with huge deficits in their budgets because the leaders failed to plan responsibly and allow for economic down turns.   California is issuing IOU's for tax refunds and other obligations.     Kindly take note that the people who actually caused this financial crisis are the same ones that are in charge of fixing the mess.   Most of Obama's white house staff and cabinet members are from the Clinton administration and other positions within the government while this financial mess was beginning to show.

It will go back up!|`|DBIKou8faa	Yes but fortunately we aren't planning on moving and it's nearly paid for anyway.    Edit:   I, for the life of me cannot imagine why all of the answers that have reflected anything but gloom have received thumbs down.  I guess misery loves company, and financial responsibility is foreign to many.|`|ZphAhwy6aa	1.5% THAT IS NOT SO BAD BUT I LIVE IN TEXAS|`|THRtsl83aa	I'm pretty sure everyone's has, with the possible exception of Texas.  Heck, my husband and I just bought our first home last April, and I'm not sure we could sell it now for what we owe on it (we put 5% down).  But I'm not worried - we bought it as a long term investment, and considering we bought it at about 60% of the price it sold for back in 2005, I'm not worried.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Its paid for but it has gone down on the tax roles by 3k. Who knows what it would sell for.|`|4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	No I was smart I waited for the bubble to burst before I bought, I also got a good rate.  Tips for success in buying a house    1) there is rarely another "buyer" when you put in an offer.  2) If there is one run, there are other houses and you don't need to get into a bidding war. This is part of the reason the market was artificially inflated to Begin.  3) If the housing market in your area goes up by 300% in 1 year and your income only increases by 2% ssomethings wrong. and your probably going to over pay.|`|oVmGcRVtaa	Y E S   bought two years ago, can not afford to sell,|`|8tf5rOXdaa	Yes.    No.    Real Estate has always made money, mine may have lost some value on paper but it is still worth more than twice what I bought it for.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	Yes my home has lost some of it's value... But since I was not thinking about selling it anyway it really doesn't matter... my neighbors all remain the same, the community hasn't changed and nobody has lost everything they had because their house is suddenly not worth what it was.... I cannot fathom why people that own real estate think that property values decreasing really affects their income... it was non liquid assets to begin with.    EDIT:  Sahara you shouldn't have bought the house in the first place if you were going to struggle to afford it.  ANY investment is risky .|`|9qKAy0dlaa	I'm not close to sell but loss is loss.|`|AA10152346	MMM not really. First it gained a lot then it lost some but at this point it's still worth more than when I bought it. In my area prices didn't fluctuate all that much.  I live in northern New England..     Bough it in 2001 at $100,000.00    Peak value around 2004 or 05 at $187,000.00    Actual worth is $140,000.00 or around that.|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	I have a unique situation... I got my place for a really good deal and it was worth more than what I paid... however, now it has come down so I am at the break even maybe losing a little... but. I live in a sky rise and some of the people around me have been short selling their places... so if I wanted to sell I would have to do the same. One of my neighbors just sold his unit which is very similar to mine for 40k less than what the market says it is worth.     I am sticking it out... I only have the one home not like many who have multiple and even in this time my place has kept the value better than the houses have so when it does go up I should do very well.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Yes, as have almost all homes in the country.  Worse still, the market for houses is depressed.  Mortgages are hard to get and many people are concerned about their jobs; they are not going to buy a house.  Even those who are secure in their jobs and could buy a house if they wanted to are not shopping because many of them are waiting for home prices to drop further.    If credit was more available and people were buying, you might have to sell your house for, say, 20 percent less than what it would have brought two years ago.  Thats fine if you want to move and buy a comparable house because youll probably buy the new house for 20 percent less than it would have cost you two years ago.  But if you want to downsize, the 20 percent discount youll get on your new and less expensive house will be less than the 20 percent youll lose on the home youre selling.    With so many homes in foreclosure and so much new construction that went on before the bubble burst, there is too much inventory.  Some experts say it will take two years for the market to absorb that inventory and bring supply and demand into balance.  But this year is expected to see massive job losses and, if thats the case, the housing market will remain depressed.    This meltdown was predicted by at least several economists years ago, but nobody listened, particularly our politicians.      This is what happens when our social engineering politicians look out for their own narrow constituencies and ignore the welfare of everyone else.  If I ever hear Barney Frank mention the middle class, Im going to burn him in effigy.  The lower income people he helped to buy a house are not part of the middle class, and many of them are no longer lower-income people; they are now in the low-income or no income category.    Thanks, Barney.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Yes. I'm angry because we've done the right things. My husband bought the house under value. We've put a lot of work into it. We are both working and are fortunate in that regard. But we are struggling. I finished my MBA while working and I have debt. It's getting harder to pay. The house losing value and being impossible to sell makes it that much harder. I am angry at the people that are so cold and stupid that they don't get it.    There is no evidence that it will go back up. People just assume. When will it go back up and what until then?     Some people can't afford to wait years. With global warming, who knows...  TG for Obama in some regards but he has tough opposition and he's a pragmatist. He is not FDR.    We've had the house for almost 6 years. We have a good rate. It's just really tough because the people that built the house cut corners. Nothing is selling. We have one foreclosed house in the neighborhood. That brings down home values.     I feel like we are paying too much for our mortgage for the house. almost $1500 for 4 bedrooms - 2 baths - under 1500 sq ft. It is very expensive to live in MA.    Taxes and fees are going up. Not good. It should not happen in a recession. More cuts.    Is it possible to do more than your best????    Today I feel like I don't even care if we walked away. The water heater just went. 6 years. It should last longer than that. It's not cheap. How do you get ahead when stuff keeps needing to be replaced? There goes a vacation this year. We didn't have one this past year. What are we working for? Just to survive - to always worry - will we be homeless at some point? Will we become slaves - even more so than now? What happened to the American dream?     Our dream of starting our own business is sidelined. We need money to get started and time of which we don't have. We both work a lot of hours. Since I am dyslexic, I need 7 to 8 hours of sleep at night. I can't function without it. I'm not like you normal people. I wish that I were.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	Nope, not at all, we payed such a low price for it, so we theoretically could break even,  but since you can't even give your house away in my neck of the woods,...it doesn't really matter whether you overpayed or underpayed or how much it's worth, it won't sell anyway.    After this whole BS about "buying" property, I have come to see what a government and banking scam it really is in order to enslave people.   You don't own your house if you have a mortgage, the bank does, you don't own your property, if you don't pay taxes to the real owners, they will confiscate your "land".  People like to say you have "equity" in your home if you've been paying the bank for a long time,  but you lose all that "equity" in the blink of an eye if you can't make your payments and foreclose.  The ONLY way home buying is profitable is if you are a good gambler, and you know when and how to buy and sell and have a good feel for the markets--just like playing the stock market.   The game goes like this: If you can sucker another person into the scam and get more money for it after you pay your bank note, you win.|`|k1jwNKbgaa	Yes, I had to sell my house at a big loss last spring....but was reimbursed by the Relocation company that moved my family.    Fortunately, we were able to get a great deal on home that went through a foreclosure.  Once the market comes back, we'll have instant equity.    Not worried about it, because I have no intention on  moving anytime soon.|`|BVaCJkxzaa	No here in Alaska Gov Palins leadership has helped us to not be affected by this current economic crisis. We have plenty of jobs, housing prices are stable, food had gone up a little, but businesses are moving in and bringing new jobs. I know you guys don't like her but we are in great shape here compared to doing your way.|`|qW3dVcRtaa	probably, but we do not plan on selling for at least 5 years.|`|QOgorEJGaa	No.  My taxes increased 31 per cent from last year, even though I've just owned my house for about 15 months.  The value certainly hasn't increased, but the cities want to rob the taxpayers to support their pet projects.    My home is paid for, and is my major investment.

From your own link (since I know you didn't read it)    "Officials at the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which have been investigating the outbreak of salmonella illness, said yesterday that Peanut Corporation of America found salmonella in internal tests a dozen times in 2007 and 2008 but sold the products anyway, sometimes after getting a negative finding from a different laboratory."

And is the result of th e Republican's gutting the  oversight and regulatory power of federal agencies like the FDA.    In other words--the neocon's attempt to blame this on Democrats is an outright damned lie and you should not be repeating it. Of course, the neocons don't care that 8 AMERICANS have been murdered as a result if this particular screw-up by the right wing. If they can make a dishonest buck, they don't care how many innocent people they kill to do it.    Well, they'd better wake up and figure out times ave changed.

FDA regulations were relaxed under our last President which many believe led to the unprecedented number of food related scares we've had in the past eight years.    The Peanut Butter Factory knew they were shipping poison food BEFORE Obama actually became President.  I know it's hard to believe but they knew way back even BEFORE last week....like all the way back to LAST YEAR and stuff!!!    So I just wanted to answer this question cause I know you guys are all about "being safe" and say I think this is the opposite of what we can expect.|`|IDZTtipeaa	The regulation of the food has been dismantled under the past several administrations, most notably under Republicans, but Dems are not free of guilt.

1bf060a84781833280e4d2fd8eac4c5daa	It's wrong, it's dumb, and the only way you can stop it is to turn in your credit card and tell them you don't wish to be part of their scheme. It won't  stop until enough people let the credit card companies know that they do not want this kind of behavior.  Congress won't listen because the banking industry has them in its pocket.    Ask them to explain to people with perfectly good credit why they have to pay for those credit cards which they give to people with not so good credit, then charge 36% iinterest. The banking industry has made HUGE mistakes over the last 30 years, but who gets screwed?  The average customer with good credit.     When the banking companies had congress repeal the loan-sharking laws (high interest rates, etc) during the Carter administration, they said the rates would would only stay high until the rate of inflation went down. At that time the upper rate was 10%.  Charging a rate higher than 10% was considered to be a criminal offence.  Yes, the rate of inflation was in the double digits, so congress repealed the law.  That however, does not excuse the exorbitant rates being charged by credit card companies today.|`|hfRiTud3aa	i know that's not right what they are doing  specially because we tent to buy more stuff and we have credit card to use it and  that's bad for us all|`|uEyxjAdcaa	Of course they profile people, they want to lend money to the people most likely to pay it back.

Only the clueless leftist media would make it out to be a bad thing.|`|wUooHVU3aa	I'm with Clarence. This has been going on since credit cards first became available to the general public. Students and people with low credit scores are targeted with higher interest rates, due to the risk of their credit amount not being repaid.    The media is trying to create a story where none exists. This has been going on for so long, it's like a news anchor telling you "the glowing ball of light in the sky, as reports indicate....is called the SUN!"

Most begin with a certain amount of time in their present position.     To get advanced from E-1 to E-2 in the Navy is 9 months. E-2 to E-3 is the same way, 9 months. All you have to do is what is expected of you and not get into trouble and you will be advanced.     Going from E-3 to E-4 is a little more difficult. Not only do you have to have time in grade but you need to have good evaluations and pass a written test. Not only do you have to pass the written test but you have to score within the percentage of people that are being advanced. So if the advancement rate in your job is 20 percent, you have to score in the top 80 percent of people in your present grade taking the advancement test. Once you have all of those you must complete a petty officers indoctrination course.    You go through the same procedures to go from E-4 to E-5, and E-5 to E-6 but the length of time required at each step is different. Each level has it's own leadership development course that is required.     Once your an E-6 and want to go to E-7 you not only have to have time in rate, pass a test and have a good evaluation you have to submit a package to a board and interview for advancement.     So the progression is easy at first and then gets substantially harder at each step.|`|HCKPDXhpaa	Generals go the officer route meaning they have four or more years of college.

Obamas breathtakingly rapid disavowal of his own campaign pledges expresses far more than his own dishonesty and cynicism. It reflects a deep crisis of American democracy. The existing institutions and political framework are impervious to the democratic expression of the popular will. Whether a Democrat or a Republican is in office does not impact the basic direction of government policy. The two-party system functions ever more crassly as the instrument through which the ruling financial oligarchy exercises its political power and controls the state. It flows from this essential political fact that the direction of the Obama administration will not be altered by popular pressure from the left, as claimed by the myriad left-liberal and petty-bourgeois protest organizations oriented to the Democratic Party. The end to war and inequality, and a settling of accounts with the crimes of American imperialism, cannot be realized within the framework of a degenerated capitalist-imperialist regime. What is required is not changethe hollow mantra of the Obama campaignbut social revolution.    If there is one salutary impact of Obamas election, it is that it will discredit the Democratic Party and its use of identity politics as a means of diverting attention from the class struggle and the oppressive and exploitative nature of capitalist society. The fight for social equality, which requires the unity of the working class, was replaced with the allocation of social privileges to small sections of various minority and/or oppressed groups. For decades, the proponents of American liberalism, backed by the various petty-bourgeois radical groups, have sought to elevate race, gender and sexual orientation as the essential categories of American society, while deliberately obscuring the significance of class. The rise of identity politics has coincided with a sharp move to the right by the Democratic Party. The promotion of affirmative action and similar policies has been accompanied, however, by deepening social inequality, including an enormous growth of social inequality within the black population. With the election of Obama, racial politics will be put to the test. The decisive social category in the United States and in every country remains class. And as class struggles erupt, they will sooner rather than later be directed against the new Obama government|`|9c3d57b781184db8448192ff51aafff6aa	You just hate Obama, don't you?

There are great people in both religions, and not so great ones...as seen by some of the posts here on yahoo.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	He's not, he's a Christian convert.

Some people look at Muslim as being a terrorist, Muslim is just a religion. I know many people here in the U.S. who are Muslims and by far a terrorist. They are the nicest and generous people.  I didn't vote for Obama, but I do have to defend the fact that they are not all terrorist, Its just a religion. Because we are at war with the middle east and them being Muslim, may just leaves a bad taste in ones mouth.|`|t00QAsfJaa	he stated he had distant relatives who were muslim,i think that makes him muslim,and hes not the first black president,hes the first arab american president

He told his listeners the day after the election "conservatism didn't fail; it wasn't on the ballot."    Let me decode.  The Republican party has been hijacked by Neo-cons since the 80's and the average voter doesn't even have a clue that anything has changed.    You don't have to believe that or agree with me.  But you have to admit, when a staunch Republican Conservative like Rush Limbaugh makes a remark to that effect, that should tell you something.  He's admiting there's trouble in his own ranks and changes could very well be made.    Sadly, most Republican voters nowadays are not supporting what they think they are.  They don't call these politicians neo-"cons" for nothing.|`|GZ8fzKvHaa	Why all of these questions regarding Limbaugh?  He even upset Obama, former presidents have always managed to stay above the statements make by talk show hosts.  Plus everyone keeps calling Limbaugh a drug addict, are these the same people that voted in Obama?  Have they forgotten his own past of drug use?  Why is it okay for the President to have used drugs but not someone who disagrees with the President.|`|4crqyM2laa	Rush is the leader of the Conservative movement although he has not declared himself as that.  I believe Conservatives that care about this countries future would vote him in though.  Do all of the people answering negatively about Rush actually believe this country became great by being socialist?  Perhaps you have been too spoon fed by your parents.    I don't think Rush would allign himself with the liberal republican party at this point.  There is a big difference between being a mushroom and fed manure in the dark, as the socialist democratic party would do to take care of its servents.  Instead we should take the road to success by using our brains!   The Conservatives party would like to see all people use their brains, for their own good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am sick and tired of late 60's and 1970 hippie's telling this country how rotten it is.  THC is stored in the brain the they cannot get rid of it.  These THCer's like the criminal Bill Ayers are teaching our children???????????????????????????   Conservatives you better get off the floor if you want this country to be successful again instead of being led around by a ring in the nose by the liberal no matter what party they are in.  All they care about is control of our money.
9VaWal2Daa	Lets see..........illegal drugs...........umpteen wives...... intelligent of a 3rd grader..........    I'd have to say Yes.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	Yes.   Cause Republican values are all in what's said, not what people do.    Limbaugh says druggies are bad, but took so much heroin that he's deaf.    Republicans are all supposedly Christian, but could care less if 50 million Americans don't get health care, so long as the profits keep coming.    Bush is a Christian who started war on a whim.    That's Republican values for you....    The only 'value' Republicans truly care about is your bank account.   The poor are worthless to them.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Let's see-doctor shopping (or did he send his maid to do it?)  ( I don't understand this.  I had a prescription at Mayo Clinic and Fl. had to call DEA.

Your Republican values on oxycontin."    "Any questions?"|`|PG2gd1tOaa	He represents his own views which just happen to align with others views, I have to agree with much of what he says and I think anyone that says he is not patriotic is a fool, only a true patriot has the spine to stand up and question his leaders and their motives unlike those that blindly follow without questioning...such as Jim Jones followers. Rush is not afraid to say, "the king is naked"!|`|6sz5UoQ8aa	He represents the working, thinking and logical people of this nation.  does that count?|`|vwYbFtkqaa	No, as a person he does not represent Republican values.  He has been divorced three times. He is an addict and during the Vietnam war he found a way to avoid military service.    What Rush Limbaugh is?  He is the mouthpiece of the GOP, every day he receives his talking points from above and he faithfully spouts them, including "I hope he (President Obama) fails".  So, it is evident that while Rush may proclaim himself a true American he in fact is a traitor to the American people and to this country.|`|lrMCiDnraa	What office does he hold? He is a radio personality and the more  Democrats cry about what he is saying the more people will tune in and listen to him am I the only person to figure this out?|`|PCbfSSjmaa	I have never really heard Rush Limbaugh say much on "family or moral values". Have you even listened to his program before? He mostly talks about being fiscally conservative and not letting the government too big. A few years ago I couldn't stand the man and then I actually started listening to what he was saying and some of it made sense. He's also pretty funny.|`|Q5D4CRFkaa	he represents a recovery addict who should thank his lucky stars that there are idiots out there like him. that's the only reason he still has a job...|`|AA11963685	According to my lifelong Republican stepmom, he represents the type of Republican far right conservative that caused them to lose the election to Obama.  She intensely dislikes him and thinks any Republican who listens to that blowhard (which is what she calls him) ought to be ashamed of themselves.|`|kMYE3vV8aa	No, he represents himself and conservative ideas, not necessarily values.  He is no saint, but you know what?  He doesn't pretend to be something he isn't, unlike our current president.    Rush is there to share conservative political ideas to help improve our country.  He is not there to teach you morals and values... go to church if you want that.    He tells things like they are and provides entertainment while doing so.|`|43zXRpLYaa	Rush Limbaugh represents conservative ideals.

Bob, you are the first person on the planet earth I have seen call The Great Depression a "deep recession."  Recessions and Depressions are two different things, and the stock market crash of '29 CERTAINLY wasn't a recession.  Recessions are brief periods of economic decline that usually don't affect the economy that badly.    What we had in '29, and what we are going through in the present are DEPRESSIONS.  When money disappears, businesses close, and the stock market crashes, you know you are in a depression.

After interest, it's $1.3 Trillion, so where you got that number I have no idea.      Now for the socialism issue:     1.) America has been fractionally socialist since the 50's.    2.) It isn't socialism, when the money is a loan, which our grandchildren will pay back (whether or not it's a good idea...that I'm still unsure about).    3.) When it comes to principals of types of government, it doesn't matter how much money it is.  If the government gets financially involved with a private corporation or sector, that is slightly socialistic.       I'm not sure if this stimulus package is a good idea or not, but we do have to try something.  Personally, I'm 40% socialist and 60% capitalist.  I think things like health care, education, etc. should all be paid for through a flat tax.  I do think it's patriotic to pay taxes, and I think it's unfortunate that taxes and socialism have gotten a bad reputation.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	Keynasism economics.

The Federal Government of Washington, DC redistributes taxpayer money to their own interests all the time. Is this what you allude to? Yes; it is Socialism... Marxist Socialism, to be exact. The definition of Marxist Socialism is "the stage following capitalism in the transition of a society to communism, characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles." Redistribution of wealth via means of colorable law is perhaps exactly what Carl Marx had in mind. Soon the United States of America will become openly Communist if the pigs are allowed to continue in their Capitalist/Socialist/Communist ways. I say shoot them all and start all over. It may be the only way to effect the necessary changes in this country. Just a thought...|`|QYXij5Wcaa	Generally, Socialism is the retribution of money to public sectors. USA has adopted socialism (somewhat) by setting up school systems. However, this entities are for the benefit of the corporations of which are private. The tax payer is not getting the benefit of public services. It is beneficial to the high management sector and stock holders only. One such "socialist" state is Sweden, who would go nuts at the thought of giving tax payers money away.
Ln5XNno3aa	Do not sigh anything until you get what you want, if she says a MOS is not available, tell your recruiter your not going to join. I did this when I enlisted and all the sudden a spot became available, allot of recruiters try to push you into joining their MOS, but the choice is yours. Doing something you like in the Army is very important, don't settle for something you don't want to do. Your recruiter gets paid to put people in the Army make them work for it. No job is EVER closed, if your recruiter tells you this, keep pushing for the job you will eventually get it.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	There have been so many changes to MOS codes in the last decade, I'm not going to go back and look up the ones you have shown interest in. But I will offer that you shouldn't take one that you aren't happy with. If you need to wait an extra month so your next four years won't be miserable then wait! The last thing we want is a soldier that hates his job. If you are really set on 21W tell your recruiter to give you a call when it is available. When she sees you are serious she can some times make a call to MEPS and get a position open. Best of luck and I hope you get what you want!|`|AA12042641	push it back bro... no rush.. maybe you can DEP in and that way you can get the MOS you want later... I know you've heard this before.. but don't trust recruiters! my recruiters were really cool and all but you gotta take care of your own damn self.. maybe even call another recruiting office... take your time... make a list of the MOS you like and don't like.. pros and cons... don't rush these decisions and don't worry about pissin your recruiter off cus chances are you won't be talking to them for a good long while... and if you haven't enlisted yet... do ROTC! lol easy money, free education and you'll be a Lieutenant wen you finish haha.
Ln5XNno3aa	There is no real nice way to say it. Recruiters look at you as a number, nothing more, there is someone sitting in front of them, wanting to join the Army, and it is their job to get them there. You have to be firm or they will just keep pushing you and pushing you, the next thing you know your in the Army for 5 yrs doing something you hate. You have got to be firm.

Why can't the churches stop their own from having abortions?  Outlawing it will not stop it.  The rich will fly somewhere where it is legal.  And the poor will find the way to do their own, risking their lives.  Take a look at history on this or what women do in countries where abortion is illegal.      Let's solve some social problems and the abortion rate will go down on it's own.
2ISGwSK7aa	Bush all but decimated the GOP. I find it interesting that not only did NOT ONE Republican in the House support the Stimulus bill, but 11 Democrats were against it as well. That says something.|`|jHDc6Rwmaa	I hope someone finally stands up and tells people what is what. I keep watching the news and they just keep saying stuff like, "the republicans really need to change some polices and find some issues that the youth of today care about to stay relevant." ARE YOU KIDDING!! How can any principled person suggest that you give up what you believe in and support something else just to win and stay in power. How about, if you actually believe in the issues that made up the republican party, then support the republican party, but if you support the party no matter what issues they support, then maybe you just shouldn't vote.

G2auAv1Saa	It is not the folks coming from Mexico (they can't vote). It is the people moving here from democrat states to find work that is making it more liberal. What they don't realize is why we have one of the strongest economies is because of our long term Republican leadership, that is why they are having to move here for jobs.    EDIT: There are blue counties spread all over the state.   Here is a map (for some reason the republican is blue and democrat is red)   http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/s...  The red counties are where there is a lot of job growth. In the east, Jefferson & Harris. North- Dallas. Central- Austin & San Antonio, and those in the south are booming with new border patrol jobs. It is people moving in from out of state for these jobs. Austin is known as little California as a good bit of its population is from California.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	I dunno, how long till liberals lose California they just voted to ban gay marriage after all.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	NO... the country as a whole has shifted left in the last sixty years...

6Cp41lb6aa	As I posted to a similar question on the same thread:    Most of the arguements against unlimited immigration are not economic ones.    Language - A nation that doesn't have a national language is doomed to be Balkanized, and will break up along those linguistic boundaries.  If everyone in the northeast speaks English, everyone in the South speaks French, everyone in the southwest speaks Spanish, and everyone in the northwest speaks Chinese, do you have a nation or an empire?    Crime - With porous borders, a lot of trade comes through, but so do a lot of drugs.    Soverignty - A nation has historically had the right to defend its borders. Nations that don't find themselves invaded.|`|v2Ubw5hTaa	Jeff T. is right.    Legal immigration is contributing to the balkinization of the USA (and also the UK). By 2042, Americans are going to be a minority in America. I certianly don't want my children growing up as a despised minority.    Why is our government doing this to us?|`|bQgxyxQSaa	Just walk in your countys health department and county social services. FLOODED WITH FREELOADING. Costing US millions and billions.

LEBV1FPuaa	Yes it is not a allegation it is a fact and China is violating WTO rules by placing banking tariffs to raise the exchange.

Food Workers Cost over seas $6 to $500 per outsourced job price here $20,000 to $70,000 Unfair    Steel workers Cost over seas $8 to $1500 per outsourced job price here $25,000 to $80,000 Unfair    Lab Research Cost over seas $50 to $15,000 per outsourced job price here $45,000 to $150,000 Unfair    Engineering Cost over seas $40 to $10,000 per outsourced job price here $40,000 to $120,000 Unfair    Auto Workers Cost over seas $10 to $8,000 per outsourced job price here $25,000 to $67,000 Unfair    Jobs stolen in the last 15 years over 11.5 million and that is why a poll shows 91% of real Americans support Buy American.

gYfvCkRPaa	Yes, it is illegal. It is called fraud.    It is easy to determine if the payment was made by examining bank records.    The punishment would depend upon the amount due - so it could be a misdemeanor or felony.|`|AA11206283	Yes; and a waste of time.    Fraud charge.|`|UkwZbcaeaa	No.  You should ALWAYS lie to debt collectors and police.  Of course, you WILL get caught.  You'd just get them off your back for a while, like a couple of days.  Just piss 'em off a little, but they can't charge you more or anything.  Just say it was forged before you got it.  Say you actually got it in the mail, and it's a shock to you that it is fake.      It's really not worth the effort, because just screening your calls takes less energy.  I never did mind debt collectors, they are so much fun to mess with and be rude to.

The military gives you and your family So many benefits. Insurance, house pay, and medical. Right now they way the economy is going it is definitely a good choice! Talk it over with your hubby and if he is willing to support your choice and possibly gt up and move than I'd say by all means go for it! You'll be so proud with yourself and what you'll accomplish. And if and when you decide to have kids they will take care of everything. Medical, special pt, maternity leave, child care, pretty much everything! I see preggo Marine's on base all the time. They take good care of you in the service when your preggo. And since your a woman you have a slim chance of deploying into a combat field. (from what I'm told) Hope this helped, good luck!|`|24T71hYjaa	You need to speak with a recruiter to find out those answers.  my main concern is that you might not be able to join because you donated ur kidney.  I could be wrong but any major health issues can deny you.    Make sure you are joining for the right reasons.  If you are joining to get insurance for the family and for money, are you OK with putting your life on the line every day?  Are you OK with the possibility of being deployed to the far ends of the earth without your family?      If you get pregnant you will still be required to serve.  You will likely not be send into a battlefield while pregnant but once you have recovered then yes.      I don't think militiary insurance is that great to be honest.  You'd be better off applying for a grant or loan and going back to school for a different career.  Complete a FAFSA form and see what you are eligible for.  Apply for lotto money at the college too.    IMHO I think military personnel should not have families while serving because it is so stressful on the families.|`|6YOcZiN1aa	First of all, if you are considering joining the military, I would have to suggest the Air Force.? Generally speaking, they have the best quality of living, and the shortest deployments.? Depending on your job, you may deploy for 6 months to a year, but are usually only 4 month deployments, and an occasional TDY for a couple weeks or a month, here and there.? You will be able to finish college, but remember, it will take a little while longer than if you were going to school full time.? You may even have to take distance learning depending on what your schedule is like.? It is a stable paycheck, but unfortunately you really don't make much money at all when you first join.? If you have college credits, OR if you sign up for 6 years instead of 4, it doesn't matter what branch you serve in, you will come in as an E-3.? A little bit better pay, but like I said, you really don't start noticing decent pay until several years later and you start making some more rank.? Please keep in mind that there is a lot of BS to put up with.? Granted, every job anywhere will have it's pros and cons, you really have a lot to put up with in the military.? If? you get pregnant, you will work normal duty hours up until a certain point, and I'm not sure what that is.? It may be the last couple months or just the last month, you're not allowed to work more than so many hours a day.? I believe it's a half a day, but don't quote me on that.? Once you have the baby, you get an automatic 6 weeks of maternity leave.? As far as assignments go, you may not be able to get stationed overseas.? I don't know what his whole situation is, but depending on what he has to see the doctor for or if he needs a specialist of some sort, that overseas location needs to be able to have the facilities to take care of him in order for you to live there.? Not a big deal, I am stationed with several people who have to do their whole career in the states because of family members.? If you have any more questions, please email me.? I just want you to remember, I know a lot of people will tell you that the military is a great option for a good paycheck and all that, but please remember, they pay is steady, and that's different than great.? It will take a couple years to build up.? However, there are options once you are in.? You can even finish your school and apply for your commissioning or just get back on your feet and in four to six years move on.? Again, please let me konw if you would like any more information.|`|433571011989f7699b6947635139e845aa	UNfortunately, you are automatically disqualified from serving because you only have the single kidney.|`|8f37744c1e62060b47e2487490582af1aa	Well you definitely have a lot to think about.  When I went into the Air Force, there was a girl in basic training that found out she was pregnant and she had to leave, she never would have been able to do the strenuous regime they have in Boot Camp.  Other than that, if you get pregnant, it's just like any other job.  But there are no medical charges (I don't believe) at the base hospital.  As far as education, it's a pretty good setup.  I believe they pay 75% of tuition while you're active duty.  As far as being apart from your husband, you go through boot camp (6-8 weeks) and then you have your training school for whatever your job would be.  That could be as little as 2 months (for maybe an office job) or near a year or more (medical jobs).  All of my answers ( especially the one about how long the 2 of you will be apart) are based on one important difference than your current situation.  This country was NOT AT WAR at the time of my enlistment.  You have a lot to discuss with your husband, only because I'm sure that you would hope he would discuss anything this major with you.  Good Luck with your life!!!
0918eb31ce1520001d965c6085d6abc5aa	You make a good point. I wish Obama and his followers would understand this. It's just simple numbers, yet the stench of pork overpowers even the greatest minds!|`|6CAsx3jaaa	i agree with most of your statement. he was trying to compromise with the gop who wanted tax cuts then voted unananmously against it. the stim package should be in infrastructure primarily and some inverstment . we have to realize that we probably wont get back to where we were for awhile because we have had a paper economy for awhile. companies making money on the stock market through manipulation rather than a substantive basis. when there isnt a product its a false economy that will tumble like a house of cards|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Yes - I'm shocked that he's just repeating the same mistakes of Bush that got us in this problem in the first place - borrowing and spending money like a drunken sailor while doing nothing to increase tax revenues.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Some think yes, some think no.  Opinions expressed here are only that, not facts. Time will tell who is right.|`|reeU4N0eaa	Isn't it 900 Billion now?|`|WJ7pRtD3aa	you had 8yrs of bush tax cuts.. how'd that turn out hmm?    it's time to try something else..|`|AA11963685	So many opinions, so little consensus.  No matter what route Obama took to repair our economy, there will be those who don't like it.  I know one thing.  It's sure not as simple as three paragraphs or an analysis from the Washington Post.  So I guess we will have to wait and see and pray it's at least part of the answer.|`|MNZ8iqFqaa	Yes!! Taxes aside there's way to much pork spending in this bill that will in no way help the economy!|`|UwsbuHZYaa	Lets have a look at the pork:  http://www.economistblog.com/2008/10/05/...      it's a trillion dollar welfare check which will not stimulate one single job but secure that the welfare rats don't ever look for one either.  --------------  For all the idiots that think Bush TAX CUTS are the same as   GIVING money in the form of a bailout-what is wrong with you? Have you lost the ability to think or even reason?|`|B1XT60WEaa	Did you know that a 100% tax break will not help the unemployed??|`|rWdYBmPmaa	In a word yes it is a mistake.    There should be tax cut to middle and higher class people (the lowest class pays no tax. Give the people back THEIR money and let them spend it as they see fit.    Unfortunately with any stimulus people will be paying down debt first, that is not a total bad thing, people have extended themselves so far that they need to pay off some debt. And that is their own fault, people like living above their means.    I have said long ago, they started with credit cards then home equity loans then car loans now reverse mortgage loans. By the time they are done, we would have come into this world with nothing and lest with nothing.     What they should do is let what ever company that is going to go out go. (I know it is hard better to take our lumps now) then let them be picked up by who ever will pick them up.     Then the government needs to stay out of what they do not know. In addition to all of them being replaced with what the founding fathers originally wanted. It was only a part time job not a career.|`|5zJmqpMPaa	Yes.|`|vFGojyBHaa	Only a very small portion of the proposed $815 billion would actually provide job stimulus...the rest is nanny state money to lull the populace into submission for creeping socialism.|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	Stimulus plans to spur spending have never worked. See Europe's attempts and for a giant example look at what Japan tried. Companies are not that stupid. They wont start hiring and building capacity based on a temporary spike in orders with an anticipated tax hike coming.|`|c8672da7ef4d6901656bd2ee445c88a0aa	YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11824333	BIG mistake. This is not a stimulus plan it's a spending spree.|`|8a8e5dcc284740df009d2405e628cc0faa	Yes. Not only it is a mistake but to top it all President Obama just showed us in plain sight how he is so NOT different than Bush.   More of the same friends.  This stimulus package is rattled with earmarks. Millions will be going for programs that have absolutely nothing to do with stimulating the economy and promote growth such as student-loan programs, clean-water projects, housing assistance, education financing such as new buildings for schools along with equipment purchase. And then this: 335M to prevent STD ?????????? 50M for the national endowment of the arts ??????? $70 million for a supercomputer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and $75 million for smoking-cessation programs ?????? We are now bailing those who have been warned against tobacco use for decades????   Now here is the quicker ... ready? You and I will be getting ... hold on now ... $500.00!!!!  OMG! Can you believe it?  We are rewarding greed, irresponsibility, unaccountability, perversion, sex, paint brushes and computer wisdom for our kids. But the economy itself? The struggling middle class? The struggling small businesses? Those who do right, obey the laws, follow the rules and pay their taxes ... those get NOTHING.  Morale here is this: be greedy, steal, lie, live dangerously and when you fail the government will bail you out. Be a good citizen and you will get nothing in return.  Thank you President Obama for showing that you are no different than Bush and that you have fallen under the pressure of the liberal democrats who would rather fund social programs than save this economy and especially the vast population who depend on it.  The details of this stimulus package just made up my mind about Obama ability to govern and be different. As I thought ... he lied.|`|8ad6fQiNaa	I keep hearing people bashing the stimulus package and talking about how it won't effect the economy. Obama didn't make the package on his own, he sat down with some of the best economists in the nation and had them draft it with him. During his campaign the vast majority of economists in the country, to include the one who just won the Nobel prize for economics, agreed with his policy and said that it had a better chance of success than what Mccain was suggesting.        I'm not an economist, I have a rough understanding (as does the average American) of what it will take to fix this. I'm going to side with the POTUS on this and see where it takes us.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Yes and more and more people are beginning to see that Obama is a big mistake too !|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	I know right now the only tax cut is if you bought your home after july of this year.So that leaves a lot in the dark,not to mention that credit has to be paid back what a joke
8rGZFBKOaa	Kit gloves, rose colored glasses and a name plated hole in the sand where they spend 20 hours a day of their time. It's a sad, sad, thing. True comedians are leaders, not followers. They lead with humor to ease the harder hearts into the truth they insist on hiding from. Daily and Colberg are selling out and along with that sell-out goes a chunk at a time of their talent and gift of humor.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Saying something negative about Obama on TV will pretty much get their show canceled.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Yeah, hate sells over a "Slobbering Love Affair"|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Reruns, watch it at night...  Or you can watch previous episodes at http://thedailyshow.com    PLUS Jon Stewart is extremely Liberal and supports Obama.  &&& Obama isn't as funny as easy to make fun of as Bush...|`|4SLjJvcqaa	MOST LIKELY    because the dire circumstances the country is facing is due to Bush's policies|`|oVmGcRVtaa	When the damage done by the village idiot subsides, perhaps they will have no reason to, until such time suck it up and come to grips with the fact that the incompetent one has had the greatest negative effect on the general population of any American prezident in history.    When the new unemployment numbers come out Feb 6th you will see even further reinforcement of just how bad the incompetent one has hurt us all.|`|K6KeN7sgaa	Are you KIDDING?    bush's catastrophic policies of the past eight years will be felt for GENERATIONS.    Duh.|`|1eb935e6100f32fd7c9a8bad9e9be568aa	Stupidity?|`|wcDy86xuaa	reruns...|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	Ever hear of reruns?|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	Daily show are a bunch of liberal fools and Colbert is just showing everyone what fools they were|`|97VqHCIRaa	I knew the comedy shows would be starving for material once Bush left office.    He was their bread and butter... the man gave so much for us to laugh at.    He was a giver.|`|h6vOjCaPaa	They spend 2 days on transition and that is considered an obsession? If I remember correctly last time I watched was spent covering Blago (Current affair) and the closing of Guantanamo bay (Current Affair). Then again, there simply a pretty good chance you don't watch the show and are just going off a 3 second clip someone showed you where they mention Bush.    Jeez, that Stewart mentioned Jimmy Carter the other night too! Can't he realize the Carter administration is over and stop living in the past? (Sarcasm)

When he is in front of US blacks, he is suddenly a libertion theology radical.    His biological father in Kenya and that side is muslim...many fundamentalist muslim and many activists.     His cousin in Kenya even ran for President against the encumbant Democrat who was the US Ally. Obama even gave him a million dollars (from the Friends of Obama campaign fund!) to run his election against our ally. http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas... the cousin, had the support of the Muslims and promised to institute women's headdress requirements and ban pork eating, per Muslim fundamentalist practice.  He and his radical followers went on a bloody and violent rampage when he lost, (a genocidal killing spree against those who voted for the Democratic encumbant http://logisticsmonster.com/2008/10/13/o... )  that is ongoing ( http://www.aol.in/news/story/20080127073... )...he doesn't like opposition or fair elections any more than his cousin Barack does...family trait.

Promising everything yet delivering on nothing.|`|BHBQPFzlaa	sometimes a bailout is necessary. Many top economists say that we came within about a month of total economic collapse when AIG needed their bailout. This would mean bread lines, and going to the ATM to find your money gone.    A company like GM is responsible for nearly a million jobs when you take their suppliers into account. These cannot be treated like just another small business because the effect of such a company closing will affect the global economy significantly.    Also, Predident Obama can't force all democratic senators to vote for his bill without demanding earmarks (pork). This is how things are done in Washington, DC, on BOTH sides.|`|DBIKou8faa	The same, but more pork.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, some things do look the same.  As far as the figures go.

Perhaps we will all begin to understand that these things don't happen overnight. George Bush knew that, but accepted criticism anyway. Unfortunately he didn't have enough time to get us out. We must expect that Pres. Obama will need time too, and much much more than you bargained for. It's got to get worse first.|`|vFGojyBHaa	He's making GW Bush look like an amateur in terms of deficit spending...this is really disappointing.|`|c6v8veJgaa	Very ignorant question.  I hope you're not serious.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Sorry you're missing it but let me at least label one major change...our position in the world changed once we put a stop to torture.  When it comes to the economy, that change won't happen overnight.  Bush dug us a pretty deep whole and its going to take quite some time to dig out of it...especially since Republicans are still hell-bent on creating more division and promoting their selfish interests than with even trying to work out a bi-partisan effort.
xGofrX5Iaa	It's because nobody would have voted for a white guy with only two years of experience. Also people forget that his dad was never there and Obama only met him one time for ten minutes. His Mom raised and cared for him, and Obama turned his back on her by claiming he is black. What a great president.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	You are what you look like. I'm half Japanese but I have never been considered Japanese in my entire life.|`|E2h4QuxKaa	People (not just Americans) have a habit of labeling things as they see them.  Obama clearly looks more black than white and honestly none of us would even know he was 1/2 white if the media didn't keep telling us.  He doesn't seem to have a problem with being a part of history and being labeled black.  He is black.  It's easy.    I'm amazed at some of these answers.  He never turned his back on his mother, he never denied being of mixed race.  And hello people...do you honestly think that the white vote had nothing to do with him being president?  Cheating?  Are you kidding me?  Where did ya get the percentages from?  LOL!|`|wbIEau0qaa	because he looks more black than white. but i like to think f him as a minority president. its more politically correct.|`|K1iUzewyaa	maybe because the fact he got more support being black, than white... He was raised by a white mother, etc... he is pretty much, well, white... but because his "outward" appearance, droves of blacks rushed to the polls, some voting up to 6-7 times each... Like they say "if you ain't cheatin, you ain't trying." Also. because his black traits are far more visible than his white traits..|`|VlzlPAEwaa	So when and if he messes up, they will blame it on the Black President, and have a reason to never vote another non white into office..just my thought...    jj240..you are the problem we have in this country that keeps this crap going..I am mixed,,and trust me both side have problems..Sometimes I would rather be called white in certian situations ..Only because I see what a good black peron has to go through just to get ahead...you suck|`|pWA3gybAaa	I guess because America is still racist|`|el9wtu9Uaa	Hes actually 50% White, 43.75 Arabic, and 6.25% Afrikan negro if you want to be exact. In the end it doesnt matter cuz blacks dont care what he is as long as he looks black.|`|AA10302860	Yeah...no doubt...I think the same think when I look back at racial discrimination that has taken place in this country.  I'm always wondering, "Why didn't the biracial guy just say, "Hey I'm half white...so can I sit in the middle of the bus at least!"|`|UFA2UDYzaa	well because people usually never look at ur background....you are what u are...who cares who ur parents are....his skin colour is black...so hes a black man...nomatter who in his family is white...but the truth is he is as much of a white man...|`|MiB5fhePaa	Just what percentage of African DNA do you require before calling someone "black"?  51%?  60%?  75%?    The fact is that most of the people who are considered "black" have a significant proportion of white DNA in their backgrounds.|`|CqqH12I8aa	in african-american culture, 'one drop' does it. if you have only had one black great-great-grandparent, then you're still black. since he has a black father, he is still considered to be a black person before a white person.|`|jYwSKzg1aa	Well it does follow that he'd have white grandparents if his mother is white.  But I don't think anybody has any business getting offended that he relates to his African American heritage when he is not 100%.  There is no room in the 21st century for any kind of racial elitism.    If you don't care, then don't worry about it.  If other people want to be excited because of his heritage, then let them.  Who does it hurt?  All I'm concerned about is that he does a good job.

Obama worked very hard and very wisely to get into the political sphere and work his way up.  He attracted attention with his 2002 early stand against the Iraq War.

AA12042641	Yup it depends on your age. But remember to keep your back straight and bend your arms past 90degress wen you go down and all the way up wen you go up.. 4x25 is a good start.. but always keep pushing for more every week. Because that's only 100 per day. Try first doing more sets maybe 6x25 but then going down to 4x30 or doing 35,30,25,20,15. And try always using different forms: Wide arm, regular, close (diamond) push ups... You need 60points on each event to pass...  check out this link for the APFT calculator (Army Physical Fitness Test)    http://550cord.com/products/info.asp?Pro...|`|Ln5XNno3aa	there is no set amount they MAKE you do, some days are better then others, a good way to get better at push-ups is the way I did it.    Do as many push-ups as you can before you go to sleep, the next night do one more push-up then you did the night before, repeat this every night for a few weeks, and your push-ups will improve. The only time you have to worry about doing a set number of an exercise is during your PT Test, and the numbers you are required to do vary by age.|`|hexzaIGgaa	Depends on how many times you screw up.|`|VC8ivJHjaa	For Army Basic Training, you must be able to earn 50 points in the Push Up event to graduate.

Your going to reach a phase called muscle fatigue. This breaks down the muscle to a "shaking point" of pure exhaustion. By doing this, you create a stamina and endurance. Don't just do 25, do as many as you can in 2 minutes, then 3 minutes. Make sure you do diamond pushups, wide arm, and close hand. Go to a recruiter and ask him to observe your form. If your form is not correct, your pushup will not count!!!     Good luck to you!|`|8Ak1FehYaa	LOL, I laugh because they had us doing push-ups at PT until we hit muscle failure and then if we weren'r running everywhere (to improve our run and move with a purpose) , they had us get down and give them 20 more (to improve our push-ups, on top of of that I was still only doing one push-uo on my PT test so I had to do psuh-ups at night for two minutes or I would get recycled.

058a913241387a56c8d5ef57b777338baa	I am assuming you are talking about English law.  The basic rule is that the loser pays all the winner's costs.  So if you make a claim and get 2000 then your solicitor will submit his or her bill to the defendant.      There are a few exceptions though.  If your claim is worth less than 1000 then it is a small claim and you have to pay your own costs.    Your solicitor would also have to justify his costs.  If they are not agreed by the defendant then ultimately the court decides what amount of costs are paid.  Depending on your agreement with your solicitor you might have to make up any shortfall between your solicitor's bill and the amount the defendants are ordered to pay.    If a defendant makes an offer to settle a claim, but you don't accept it and then you only end up getting the same or less than they offered later then you have to pay your own costs from the date of the offer.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	In England the unsuccessful side.   However, if the defendant has made a sealed offer. That is it has made an offer to you and sent a copy of that offer to the Court which is not to be opened after the hearing (hence sealed) and the award the court gives is less than the offer the Plaintiff will be responsible for all cost from the date of the offer. A large proportion  cost are incurred in the final run up to the trial|`|v5BwnUZdaa	the other side|`|TYxUM1PYaa	It goes either way(Texas), it would be stated in the claim when initially filed, whether the claimant was seeking all court and solicitor retainment reimbursement. It would also have been stated in open court by the representing attorney when asked what monetary awards the party was seeking. If not paid by the losing party, typically a percentage of the award is given to the attorney. You see this allot in cases where the claimant is unable to afford paying an attorney per hour, and the "cheap" attorneys won't seek reimbursement because they want it over with as quickly as possible, and a company is more likely to settle when the awards being sought are in a smaller amount.|`|AA10855779	Most, if not all, solicitor costs are payable by the defendant (in the UK). It will depend on the agreement you signed with the solicitor at the start of the claim. If it is on a no win no fee basis and you signed a CFA there will be certain situations where the claimant could bear some of the costs. This should have been explained at the outset. For instance if you have not cooperated fully throughout the claim and because of this your solicitor has incurred extra costs you may be liable for these extra costs.

In 2005, the government gave temporary assistance to approximately 2,000,000 needy people. In comparison, more than twice as many people (nearly 5,000,000) were granted welfare in 1995.    Source: Office of Family Assistance, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	Well, I don't have numbers for you but to be clear    Unemployment is NOT welfare - when people work - THEY pay into this as an insurance.  You can NOT get unemployment if you did not work or if you did NOT pay into it.  Example, my husband owns his own business - truck driving - and makes a choice to not pay into unemployment benefits - therefore, he would not be eligible for benefits because he did not pay in.  I on the other hand would be eligible as I have worked and paid in to the benefits.    Social Security Retirement - NOT welfare - again, this is for people who have PAID into this from having worked.  They get money based on what they have paid in.    Social Security Disability - NOT welfare - again - based off of what you have earned and paid in MOST of the time - for the most part - HOWEVER - for example, a wife can get funds based on her husbands contriubtions and vice a versa.    SSI - this is more of a help money and doesn't equate to work and paid in.  It does require that one be a citizen OR a LEGAL Alien.  There are problems with distrubtion of illegal aliens receiving these funds.    Government assistance is things through the Department of Human Services - Food Stamps, Government Cash assistance, Government Health Insurance, Utility assistance, rent assistance, Section 8 housing, subsidized housing.    To qualify for these things, you need to be nearly living on the streets.  Grant it  -there are many liars out there driving nice cars (somehow) and cheating the government - but there are also many out there who have no choice and have had true back experience putting them there.  Thereis also issue in that illegal aliens get these services as well.  Illegal aliens should not get them - they should at least be made to gain a legal status to recieve these funds.  I am not saying to not give emergency care to a child or even an adult - but once discovered, it should be corrected.
AA11494150	Yes, for two reasons.    First of all, there is no expectation of privacy with abandoned property.    Secondly, a warrant is not needed to search a vehicle. The landmark US Supreme Court case on this is Carroll v. United States (The Carroll Doctrine). As long as the officer has probable cause, he can search without a warrant. The driver fleeing the vehicle is probable cause.|`|AA11622716	Depends.  If you mean "abandoned" in the legal sense, then yes.  If you mean that the suspect jumped from the car and ran away, the search will turn on several factors.  If the cops had probable cause to believe there was evidence in the car, then they could search it.  It it was left in the street or on private property then they could impound it and inventory the car as part of the impound process.   There are other exceptions as well, but a complete discourse on the 4th amendment would require several books.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Unless he took the time to roll up all the windows and lock all the doors.

In practice, things such as that tend to get overlooked.|`|WrDGhduxaa	If the car is abandoned and not locked then they can search it.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	Yes of course they can|`|OP7lLIitaa	if they had probably cause yes|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Key word abandoned|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	An abandoned vehicle could be a potential crime scene.  Of course they have cause to search.|`|3BhXf5MYaa	Yes, its considered abandoned property.|`|ftELrRJraa	Your question is lacking key specific information as to the circumstances surrounding why it was abandoned.  The short answer is yes, but the scope of the search may be limited depending on the totality of the circumstances.  This also will differ from state to state depending on case law and state constitution.

So, please, to all the women:  If you're supporting Palin, because she's a woman, take another look.

If you are a citizen, you can elect only member of parliament from your constituency and nothing else. If you are a member of BJP, it is for you to raise such leadership issues in that party. Others who do not belong to BJP have e nothing to choose between lk adwani or narendra modi.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	The only thing on which I am in agreement with you is the inept and  utterly incompetent way in which the Kandahar hijacking matter was   handled.Equally incompetent and maladroit was the handling of the   attack on the Parliament.And these are the guys who had the cheek and gall to charge the PM with being soft on terror.  Modi's appeal is yet to be assessed on a national level.Till then it is    too premature to write off Advani who,after all is a veteran of many years' standing in national politics and even on an international level.  Of course there is no doubt that Modi is a highly capable administrator  but even that is questionable if one goes by the reports on how he attracted the Tata nano car project.In the absence of any available facts  one cannot pass judgment on the charge that he has virtually handed over the duplicate keys to the state treasury to Ratan Tata and also   bent over backwards beyond reason in allowing unreasonable facilities all round.  Incidentally,non support to Purohit and Thakur does not make Advani a coward.And in politics it is common for political parties to indulge in political blackmail.What matters most is the capacity and guts to withstand the pressure.Every political party has in its cupboards files  and dossiers on every leader and worker of other political parties for   use at the appropriate time.That no one uses these files and dossiers against an opponent is because of an unwritten code amongst the various parties.|`|USz2DSSUaa	MR RANA what you are forgetting is that advani or modi or vajpayee all are from the sangh pariwar[vasudaiva kutumbakam].if bjp comes on its own then we can see a vibrant india.dont try to drive a wdege.if you can come to india and help bjp come to power.secondly bjp couldnt do much because of the nda allies who have muslim vote bank and who joined bjp just because they are anti congress .thirdly why are you forgetting that 5 dreaded terrorists were exchanged for mufti syed[then congress]daughter.how can you forget that.are  the lives of 150 innocents so cheap.why dont you ask whether rubaiyya sayed  who was till yesterday congress chum was more important than 150 non vip lives.

That is the normal police procedure and can hardly be faulted.  As for Muthalik,he has no business nor any authority to act the moral  policeman.On the contrary,his action is highly immoral.And I see nothing wrong in the ATS trying to probe whether he has or had any link to the Malegaon blasts,particularly when he has the audacity to   take the law into his own hands.  The source quoted by you to show that Purohit and co are not in judicial custody is merely comments posted by readers and doesn't establish anything.  Lastly,Mayawati and Jayalalitha are least qualified to lead the nation  what with both facing a slew of corruption charges and arranging to   have the cases adjourned almost indefinitely.That the courts are   allowing matters to be dragged does not speak well of the justice system itself,which should take up the matter on priority basis if the   people's confidence in the judiciary is to be restored,not that there was any to start with.  In conclusion,I would only say that we should not let our emotions get the better of us and make us go overboard in seeing things from  individual perspective rather than objectively and in an unbiased manner.  Incidentally,have you read the excerpts of Muthalik's speeches?If not ,do get hold of a copy of The Hindu dated the 30th January 2009.No wonder the ATS probing whether he had any hand in the Malegaon blasts.You know,you shouldn't be judgmental without ascertaining the full facts.I am  in full agreement with what Dr.Knowitall has said in his answer.|`|FkeOO6Baaa	"Wise" people like you want to see 'Progressive' India being ruled by likes of Mayawati, Modi or Jaylalitha.

kKQtnfvpaa	Minimum wage does need to be raised. I'm not an economist but I'd think $9 or $9.50 an hour would work well seeing as how the national minimum wage is somewhere around $6.55 an hour last I heard and that's nowhere near well enough to survive in today's economy. Some states have it higher but most states do not.|`|88Y3PJQvaa	Sure he's signed about 20 executive orders whats one more.|`|BI02ykvZaa	Clearly you've never owned a business.   Think about it. Let's say you have 3 employees making, say, $10/hr, or $30/hr in payroll. Presumably you only have 3 employees because that's what you can afford and still make money in your business.  Let's assume the President can order this change (he can't, for reasons which other people have pointed out). What's going to happen?    You fire one of your employees. Now two employees make $15/hr and one employee is unemployed.  Would you rather make $10/hr or take a gamble and be one of the ones making more or being unemployed because the boss didn't have a choice?    Alternatively, you raise your prices by 33% (since that's the increase in payroll) to make sure you can pay your employees the right amount.  What'll happen then?  People will stop buying as much of your stuff because they can't afford it any more.  You'll have to let your staff go because you aren't pulling in the same amount of money.    About half of all workers in the private sector in the US are employed in small businesses.

Surely the only reason Malaya has remained "a democratic country"  seems to be because the Japanese were defeated and thrown out in World War II with aid of British, Australian and American forces and then Malaya in forties and fifties was controlled by the British and that is why  the armed insurrection by communist guerrillas was defeated  All that has little or nothing to do with Islamic thinking?     Moreover I know about Muslim countries as I have also been to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iran, Turkey,  Jordan and Algeria. I submit the way of life in those countries can in no way be compared with the way of life and government in Malaya and in Singapore?..    Indeed .there is no mention of Malaya or Singapore being predominantly Muslim in Whittakers Almanac.They do say the population is made up of three Ethnic races, Chinese, Indian and Malay.with a minority of Europeans mostly British and that there is considerable racial tension particularly between the Chinese and Indian sections. No I do not think this would be appropriate for Obama to  go to get a true impression of the Islamic world..         .

Yzcptoagaa	If you have a judgment there will be a post-judgment interest rate set by your state (not the judge) that will automatically begin running from the date the clerk enters judgment.  It is probably along the lines of 10%-15% per annum, simple interest.

Oh wait ok I get it|`|THRtsl83aa	Well, I'm a California conservative, but I'll answer anyway.    I do not think two gays committing themselves to each other should be called "marriage."  The argument they use is that it is a "contract between consenting adults."  But, if you're going to use that argument, you must apply it to everyone equally (lest you be accused of bigotry yourself).  That means relatives should be allowed to marry, since they are consenting adults.    Now, if you're going to say 'incestuous marriage isn't ok because they have an increased risk of having kids with birth defects,' then again, you must apply that equally to everyone.  That means you can't allow *anyone* with an increased risk of having kids with birth defects to marry.  So anyone with a heart defect, liver defect, brain defect, etc., should not be allowed to marry.  So which is it - not allow gays to marry, or allow relatives to marry?        Herb: Arnold is a RINO.  He is no conservative.      Phil M: Actually, it IS as liberal as they say.  Most of the people who voted *against* prop 8 (supported gay marriage, in other words) were relatively young and "progressive" if you want to call it that.  Most who voted *for* prop 8 tended to be older (although not all - I'm only 24) and more traditional in their views of "family."  That includes the majority of hispanics and blacks.

Doesn't the insurance company get to SELL an insurance policy to a gay partner who is not a legal spouse, and therefore not eligible to have benefits extended from the other spouse?

I think folks voted for it for a couple of reasons:    First, they are for civil unions but not necessarily gay marriages.  When you tack the word "marriage" on to the subject, it's a whole new ball game.  Marriage is a religious entity; most religions believe that homosexuality is a sin.  When you put the government in the mix, and gay marriage is legalized, churches could be forced to perform such marriages or lose their licenses/tax exemption statues. This would infringe on the religious freedoms of churches and pastors to practice what they believe.    Second, civil unions are already legal in the State of California.  Contrary to some false reports, gays who were joined by civil unions already had the same rights as heterosexual married couples for visitation in hospitals, tax purposes, property rights, etc.; I personally know gay couples joined by civil unions that had adopted children through the State of California.      So in the opinion of the majority of voters, the necessity of a new law wasn't really there in the State of California.     My question, (and it does not only apply to this one issue), is why do we have to keep making new laws, when we already have laws in place?

2dqQQg41aa	There are a huge array of impacts to the economy.    Anything that is impacted by supply/demand is impacted in many ways.  Many consumer product pricing can go up by as much as 50% when the demand only increases by 5%.  Think about gasoline prices.  The demand slowed only a little over the last few months.  Yet we have seen a drop in prices of over 50%.  Imagine what would happen if 12-20 million illegals left this country?  How much would the price for electricity go down?  Natural gas?  Fresh water - would we be able to water our lawns again without facing fines?    Products that are in limited supply are impacted by higher costs to everyone, not just those people who are causing the demand.    The holy grail in this issue is SUSTAINABILITY!    We cannot continue at this pace of record legal immigration.  We are already over 305 million and growing faster then ever in our history!  WE will hit 600 million in about 50 years WITHOUT a illegal alien amnesty.  We will run out of space, hospitals, schools, tax resources for anything, energy, housing, farmland will disappear, etc. all because our politicians are addicted to businesses demand for cheap labor!|`|fUFf7GQ2aa	whenever you bring people in the need  1. a job  2. a place to live  3. food  4. a car  5. health care    1. if an immigrant has that job, a native does not have a job  2. more houses built, so loss of farm & wild land  3. more food must be produced, more demand for natural resources  4. more cars, more crowded roadways  5. health care- more medical services needed  legal immigrants pay taxes, but are also eligible for government services and tax refunds.

367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	I am a current MA in the Navy Reserves and have been in for over 4 years. I love being an MA in the Navy. I would go Active Duty if it wasn't for having a great civilian job (law enforcement also).     I have traveled to far away lands and have had awesome training.     From what I've seen on the Active side, being an MA at first isn't so great. Your going to get all the sucky jobs and will be standing at gates if your in a foreign land. Once you put your time in and gain some rank you will get good jobs and life will be easier. As an MA in the Navy you will have the option of getting some really good training and chances at good schools and if your intent is to go into civilian law enforcement being an MA will prepare you for it. You will learn all the basics of law enforcement and be a step ahead of the competition. When you go to a civilian police academy it won't be hard because you've already been there and done that. Plus police departments love hiring military police veterans because they are easily assimilated into the department.    If you join the Navy you will travel the world and get to have alot of unique experiences. Good luck.|`|BmIgpoPlaa	I retired MAC.  Was on USS Midway, USS Bronstein, USS Berkeley.

gYfvCkRPaa	You need to hire an attorney - NOW!!!    If you believe legal papers are coming, you need an attorney to prepare to fight for you. Also ask your attorney to request a GAL (Guardian ad Lidem) be assigned to your daughter.    Remember this: As far as the court is concerned, your husband has no say in this matter at all. It is a "three-way" fight involving you, your daughter, and the bio-father. Have your husband back off and support you emotionally.    Notify your daughter's teacher and have her watch for your daughter's moods to change at school, and for her grades to slip. This most likely will happen (unfortunately) and can be used to help your cause in court.    As far as attorneys go, find one who specializes in this type of case. Don't go for "someone's cousin" or a friend.     Begin your fight NOW!!.|`|4w9gmvumaa	That's scary.  I wouldn't have even held a conversation with him.  He's not even on the birth certificate?

However, when determining visitation, the court will consider all evidence bearing on the best interests of the child, including her wishes, his criminal history and anything else that is presented in evidence.  If you get court papers seeking visitation, get a lawyer.  The lawyer is trained to know what sort of evidence to present in addition to the stuff you have described here.|`|AA11130699	No. Contact an attorney and go to court to get his parental rights if any severed. You have a good case and he has nothing which with he can dispute it.|`|Kn90YAzYaa	I don't know where you live, but in NC where I live, registered sex offenders can't live with or be anywhere around children, so that would include visitation.

But from what I have seen, he might be able to get visitation even though he is an ex con and a sex offender. ... It would just have to be supervised visitation.    My kid's dad is an ex con and suspected of being a sex offender too. I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to have things legally sorted out, so I have done some research on the issue. ... As things are now, I let him see our daughter with my supervision. But she usually loves to see her Daddy, so that makes it a bit different.|`|AA12155794	In all probability he will not be granted permission provided you can substantiate your allegation.|`|AA12110218	Possible - see an attorney as soon as possible     I would change your phone number now and alert your childs school     I would also consider moving if that is possible|`|s3E3KfBsaa	I dont think he will get any unsupervised visitation. If he is the loser you say he is he won't be able to afford a decent lawyer anyway!|`|7uVlYPEIaa	I would hope not. Get yourself a family attorney and see what your state's laws are on abandonment. In the state of Ohio, and I believe Michigan, it is considered abandonment and the biological parent losses all rights if they have not had any visitation or paid child support in two years. This means your husband can adopt her without his consent. If it was court ordered prior to him going to jail for him to pay child support or for him to have visitation then he may still have rights depending on how long he has been out. If he is not on the birth certificate he may have to go to court just to get any rights as a father since it has not already been determined by him signing the birth certificate or DNA court ordered testing to put him on the birth certificate.    Also make sure they attorney knows of his record and how long it has been since he has seen or paid anything for his daughter. If he uses drugs he may be court ordered to take a drug test and pass in order to get any rights to her.

I may be wrong but I believe you will spend a little time away. Try to make a case as to why you have not completed your parole obligations and set up a plan with concrete deadlines to meet the requirements of your parole. Show the judge remorse, that you have  aplan, and stick to the plan, show maturity and responsibility... the judge may have sympothy for you and your situation wether you  deserve it or not, but don't screw up again or there will be no sympathy the next time.|`|d997b5ac6eed086c92a56500bdb74431aa	Get a lawyer.

They will  put you on a probationary period after graduation that you have to serve, not sure how long but at least 6 months , maybe a year. That is your payback for being paid while trained. If you quit after the academy, you may have to pay them back about $5000.00 for wasting thier time. Then while you are getting all that good experience on the street, start working on your law degree. That is how the men in my family started their careers in law enforcement.

As it is presently constituted and operating, the government is one huge bureaucracy, whose primary goal is to keep their jobs, and all the rake off they are accustomed to get from special interests.  Of course, now we have Obama's Change government, whose primary goal is to codify their socialist agenda by pulling the teeth of the voters, so that they are either too busy trying to survive, or too busy sucking on the public teat, to trouble their lawmakers hardly at all.  They all need to go away, preferably to one of those foreign nations they so admire and to which they so earnestly pander, and leave this country to the People for whom it was intended to provide opportunity, safety and honor.  Shame none of our politicians sees any value in that last concept, isn't it?|`|QF2SgH75aa	Sadly, yes.  They don't care a rip what the people think.  That should be evident after the appropriation of the TARP fund.  90% of the public was against it and they ran it through like our lives depend on it.    My advice: In upcoming elections, vote against any member of Congress who was in during the last session.  If you see someone with the same last name, vote against them also - just in case.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	In part you are correct, except that we, the people do not think the same way. Many don't think and if they ever had an idea, it died from loneliness.  Still others have almost thoughts and believe the government is thinking  about how to save the country, when in real life they would prefer to see the people that elected them placed in a compound and worked to death to make their private pet companies more money.  Maybe 30 % of the 49% that voted against Obama, actually think and maybe 10% of the 30 are capable of thinking rationally.|`|t82AcQT1aa	True. The Government doesn't think at all.|`|KvbdA9Zgaa	The Government is having a garage sale = Selling the USA|`|8RflQ9DVaa	False. They think. The problem is once they get to the national level their perspective changes. We are then just a commodity, a necessary maintenance to deal with. We are faceless and so many numbers on a page. As their self importance (and wallets) grow they become further alienated from the people they swore to represent as they are no longer 'one of them' (us).|`|9ujT56Maaa	False, because it's backwards.    1) The government only thinks one way, no matter which "party" is in charge, and 2) we the people, by and large, do not think, and that's the problem.
bkav003oaa	Excellent point, and I like how you are driving the more fervent right-wingers crazy even though you are a conservative.     I always explain it this way, If you cut my taxes it only helps me once a year if I work at a job where they take taxes out of my check.   Generally I have to pay a professional to do my taxes as it is and find the new tax cut for me, so that costs me money. If I am laid off, it is because the economy is tanking so no amount of corporate tax cuts are going to get me a new job.     How about corporate taxes? The high US corporate tax rate is often quoted as reason to cut taxes by "conservatives" but the reality is that most corporations and businesses pay little to no taxes each year and often get REFUNDS from the federal government.   Even very wealthy citizens often can work around their taxes.    Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and that did little to nothing to prevent this disaster. Now people are saying that all you have to do is cut taxes again and all will be better!   Sorry if I cannot see that.|`|43zXRpLYaa	How does the stimulus create jobs NOW when they are needed? It doesn't. There won't be any benefit from this, if any, for at least 2 years.|`|70ce28ddca2fb9f359700f7e854fcb03aa	They also want to increase unemployment benefits and direct spending more toward job creation.|`|Ov65rYIAaa	It's the same old "trickle down" policy idea, which the past 8 years has shown us doesn't work. The only repuke policy with trickle down effects is the "every child left behind act."|`|k1jwNKbgaa	Because when businesses aren't crippled by huge taxes, they can hire more people and provide more benefits to their employees.    Creating jobs in the private sector, provides jobs that will create more wealth for the country.    By just providing social programs to people who don't work, only costs the taxpayers more money out of their pocket - and creates more dependency on the government.    The Government doesn't make any money, there are no profits - they get their money from us.....that's it.    Economics 101.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	You must be a Democrat!    *puke*|`|THRtsl83aa	Tax cuts made as incentives to buy more products for your company or to hire more people DO help the unemployed.  If businesses have an incentive to buy new computers, for example, then computer companies get more business, as do the companies they buy their parts from.  More work, therefore more people needed in the workplace.  Incentives for hiring are self explanatory.      Chi Guy: Yeah, giving people money so long as they stay unemployed is a GREAT way to motivate them to find a job, even a menial labor job.  AWESOME idea.  Not.|`|ioCiw5zlaa	Those people do not count as worth while in the eyes of GOP supporters.    I would increase and/or extend unemployment benefits for them|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	It doesn't...    But the GOP doesn't care about those who aren't working and wont help them...    IF they can get the common laborer competing against one another, then that drives down wages.|`|SSLekPAnaa	They should go out and find jobs, then we will talk. There are plenty of jobs to be had. Just open a newspaper and see!|`|xtrdlyJHaa	The owner of the small business I worked for laid off the California staff on Nov 5 because of the anticipated taxes on small business. If businesses had that money to spend instead of tax, they might hire or otherwise spend the money in the economy.    The tax cuts you are referring are not only directed at large department or discount stores. I don't see where you are getting your information. The housing bubble caused Home Depot to hire and Walmart has been on a growth track since it opened. 85% of America works for small businesses. As a former business owner, I know that taxes eat into profits making it almost not worth it.    Hillary was on the board of Walmart, so you'll have to take it up with her about how many products they sell that are from China and Pakistan (yes...Pakistan).      Think of it this way: if you owned a small business and the taxes went up $1700 a month (paid quarterly), where would you get the money? Since business is down anyway, the easiest thing is to let one or two people go. You aren't going to stop paying utilities, get rid of a vehicle (resale is low), drop inventory so orders are delayed, cut off your phones...staff are the biggest expense and that is an easy decision.    I think your comments above are uninformed, and thus reckless. I hope people write their Congressional representatives and urge them to vote against Obama's Spending Package...only 12% will produce jobs and thus 88% should be cut until we recover. That kind of spending will make taxation inevitable...we will be strapped with debt that did little but prop up Government. If those projects are so important, then why didn't they replace their past pork pie projects with these now "worthy" programs? Because pork always comes first...that is why. If taxpayers are having to tighten their belts and suffer a little (a lot) then Congress can get off its pork feeding frenzy and pretend they have our best interests in mind for a little while...at least for the cameras.  http://www.congress.org/congressorg/issu... (see how the states voted yesterday)    Obama promised no pork...ask him what the holdup is.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Ask an economist...any intelligent economist will say the best thing you can do in a recession is cut taxes.    Cutting taxes puts more money into the hands of consumers and into the hands of businesses (which can then be used to create jobs for those that have been laid off)...it really isn't that complicated.    Stop listening to MSNBC's bs dude....the GOP offered a plan that some believe would have created twice as many jobs at half the cost to the taxpayers...the Democrats didn't even listen to it and started celebrating the victory of the Obama bill before it was even passed...    Here is a fundamental fact that Democrats need to understand (that the intelligent majority in this country understands)....I can spend my money (keyword is MY) more efficiently than the government can spend my money. Businesses can turn $1 into $10 more efficiently than the government can. That is a fundamental fact and that is the reason capitalism works and communism doesn't.      Have you ever taken a business course in your life? Seriously, the job of any business is to make money. Bottom line, period, make money. That is life. When the US has a 35% corporate tax rate, the second highest tax rate in the world, it's difficult for any business to want to be headquartered here. Compared to other countries, we are raping businesses!|`|iMaRt7Eraa	So we HAVE to GIVE them everything they want??  Like we own them something because they lost their job???|`|AA11633246	First of all, dropping less money into the government coffers means that you'll have more of it in your pocket...simple.      Second of all, how does spending $800,000,000,000+ amount to new jobs?  Did you read the bill or are you going to parrot a talking point using buzz words like "infrastructure"?  If you're so convinced that something like this stimulus bill--or any other government proposition for that matter--will work, then please, by all means share it with the rest of the class.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	The GOP doesn't care about laid off citizens. That's just one step up from welfare moms and the homeless, and you know they despise those.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	It doesn't.  Tax cuts do not create jobs.    The government has been cutting taxes for 30 years.  Where are all of the jobs allegedly created by these tax cuts?    We can debate about what the government should spend money on, but we all agree that government has expenses.  Where is the money supposed to come from?    We can only cut taxes so far before we cut our own throats.    We're at that point now.    Alan Greenspan was wrong about deregulation and he's wrong about tax cuts.    If tax cuts really created jobs, we would all have five jobs by now.  I don't have five jobs.  Do you?    Tax cuts benefit rich people and corporate CEOs.  THAT'S who the republics care about.|`|ca866ce419e17f58cd9673fde5feac8faa	Only about 1/7th of the outlays in the democrats stimulus plan occur in the current fiscal year.  Substantially more of the outlays occur in 2012 or later than occur in 2009.  How is this going to help those that are layed off THIS YEAR?    http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=199    edit:"Unfortunately, the vast majority of the jobs created by tax cuts the last 8 years were greeters at WalMart and employees of Home Depot and other big box chain stores"    Really?

It has not damned the poor, but has enabled them to participate in what was once the strongest economy in the history of the world.  It is still the largest.    Every society has poor people.  No poor person is going to accept the comparative wealth argument that says a poor person here is much better off and has a higher standard of living than the poor in other countries.    Our economy has been devastated by free trade agreements that have enabled other countries to sell their goods here but makes it almost impossible for us to sell our goods there.      If you want to see capitalism run amok, look at China, which has allowed capitalism in recent years.  China now has many multi-millionaires and the poor are damned there.  A typical factory worker in China makes less than $1.00 per hour with very few benefits, and working conditions are poor.    Most socialist countries allow some degree of capitalism.  That includes China, Russia and Sweden.  In fact, it is said that Sweden has a socialist political system and a capitalist economic system.  Most businesses there are privately owned.      Would we be better off if Bill Gates and Paul Allen had not created Microsoft?  That company has 55,000 employees.  They receive good pay and extensive benefits, including stock options so they can share in the companys prosperity.  Then, of course, there is Wal-Mart, which drives independents out of business and clearly exploits its workers.  Wal-Mart also exploits and, IMO, extorts its domestic suppliers.  At some point, those chickens will come home to roost.  They always do.    You shouldnt view capitalism just by looking at Wal-Mart and you cant view it just by looking at Microsoft.  Most companies are somewhere in between.|`|KvbdA9Zgaa	The rich has the Media = Rush chewing on Viagra everyday|`|AA11633246	It favors those who act for themselves and don't rely on anyone else to do the job for them, and wealth is the RESULT of that, not the impetus behind it.

1mm7RorRaa	If you want joint custody you need to go to court. If you do go to court there may or may not be a Paternity test involved. If the mom says your the father, they may not order one unless some one contest it. There may or may not be payments expected for child support. If the mom was on medicade when she gave birth, you will be expected to pay at least half the birth bill. If you can't pay they take it from your tax return.     You can go to the county and ask for the papers to fill out for a lawyer if you can't afford one. Ask your department of social service which office to go o to fill out papers for family court, and where to get the application for a lawyer. In some county's the probation department handles both .

Yes I'm sure he has.
DQpPRg9caa	'Johnny' has failed to mention that 'Asylum Seekers' , the vast majority of whom are fake, have to be provided with housing by local councils- not wait till they are 47 like the tax paying British individual who posted the question.|`|gDxVZ0pLaa	You see you have woken up to the fact that this government treats its own citizens with utter contempt and no respect at all.You and I and many others have paid our dues as required by law, only to see all the do gooders put us at the back of the queue so that the spongers from abroad get the best help available.Its amazing how much financial help is available to everyone except to the UK citizen.  As you said, when you wanted help no doubt you had to fill in forms that run into chapters and then you were mean tested.  Boy haven't we come a long way in this country when its own citizen have to beg for benefits while the rest come here for a free-be  Rule Britannia!!!|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Its nothing to do with socialism.  All unemployed people are granted either income support or unemployment benefit.    Asylum seeker for example are not.  Many immigrants have no access to public funds.|`|61YfPllfaa	because you are indigenous, and there for not valued at all! by new labour. under labour! unless you are Islamic, you are a pain in the @rse.....NOW try to get a social worker to guide you through 100% of you rights and see how far you get. if you were a muslim, you would have specially tax payer funded centres that speak your language and milk every available penny from the system for you......welcome to your new world. now go and take your place as a second class citizen.|`|f283615ebe5370643054773229eb05d5aa	That's one of the joys of living in a socialist society.  And to think many Americans want to embrace socialism.|`|AA11010672	Know how you feel , i had some years of it and it made me very bitter . and when i did find work in education teaching then found where all the left wing socialist views came from .  The Schools and colleges are teaching it.  You will find most of the young know all about where to get all the help Even had my own Daughters spouting it at me ,   Such as it doesn't matter if i get pregnant the state will provide me money and a house.  Now i use the same attitude and get what little i can from the system and s--d the kids and the Migrants .  Did you see the bit about the conservative MP who was paying his sons expenses money as research staff while they were away at unis , it amounted to many  thousands but all hes asked to pay back is a measly 3k or so.  They all use the system even cheat to do it.. Its called perks by them corruption by me.|`|AA11097492	Dunno what you were trying to claim, then, because you can get basic jobseekers allowance simply by applying for it. You don't even need to have paid a solitary penny of tax to get it.    If you are housed by the council, you can claim council tax and housing benefit. The only way you don't get them is if you have too many savings. Consider yourself lucky you don't own your own house, because you get the square root of sod all until you get your house repossessed and need emergency housing.|`|bp59GQ0yaa	It depends on what Government aid you were trying to get.    If you have been made unemployed then you can claim jobseekers allowance and if you are the only "earner" in the household then there would be further benefits available.    You do not have to "define yourself as ill".|`|7e215c2e07bc8e9554412ccd26d20067aa	I Know what you mean - I paid into the system for 35 years and have recently lost my job - they have awarded me 54.74 per week and I have had to wait 3 weeks for that.    I have applied for 34 jobs in the past week, to be told I am over qualified for the positions applied for and am being made to feel like a second class citizen.    The average person earning 35,000 per year will have paid 250,000 into the state system by retirement age, I reckon I have paid 200,000 of mine but wonder how many weeks I will have to be on benefit before I receive that amount back!!
AA10329269	Bush I "No new taxes!" The promises from the trail are pipe dreams.

You obviously don't know a solid game plan when you see one. It's really genius. Make a bunch of bad moves during your campaign, have your running mate look underqualified if not unintelligent, start to lag in the polls, and then when things look grim, start running on the audacity of hope. The Obama camp will be stupified. McCain/Palin 08|`|f4d79d78cbd0a714a8cfa6f5a073485aaa	It's only the 4 CEO's of the Liberal Democratic news media (ABC, NBC, CBS, and CNN) who put out their phony polls, claiming that they actually asked people who they were voting for. The 4 CEO's have an agenda - get a left wing muslim terrorist-lover in the White House. I'm surprised that they just don't have a poll stating 100% for Obama and 0% for McCain. That, believe it or not, is the percentage that Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro received in their country's "elections". Conservative Americans (the majority of this great country) do not believe anything "political' that the lying left-wing liberal democratic news media airs.|`|gix0EL8Kaa	The underdog always wins, just like McCain is going to win!!!  You better believe it!!!!  Besides, since Obama is winning in the polls, Obama fans might not feel as much of a need to vote, where as since McCain is losing, his supporters (notice the difference between fans and supporters) will feel a greater need to get out and vote.|`|MxqmRhESaa	Well that is dumb question because we haven't voted yet so he can't "be losing".<br>  At least he isn't giving up, he fights to the end and thats what i like about him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  John Sidney McCain lll AND Sarah Louise Palin ---- 2008!!!!!!!!<br>  John Sidney McCain lll AND Sarah Louise Palin ---- 2008!!!!!!!!<br>  John Sidney McCain lll AND Sarah Louise Palin ---- 2008!!!!!!!!<br>  John Sidney McCain lll AND Sarah Louise Palin ---- 2008!!!!!!!!<br>  John Sidney McCain lll AND Sarah Louise Palin ---- 2008!!!!!!!!<br>  John Sidney McCain lll AND Sarah Louise Palin ---- 2008!!!!!!!!|`|GFLPgtDAaa	Well underdog mean least popular.  so he has the least votes.

Even if he is the underdog he has to complete the race just for his self dignity.|`|a055a4721bc914e97e585a34123cdeabaa	Because people take him as seriously as they take UnderDog!<br>  |`|InJlUBRmaa	Ummm, that's kinda what underdog means|`|mjQFg2icaa	He's a loser, not a looser.|`|fWHvDOiuaa	Typical Obama supporter...I think you need to buy a dictionary. The underdog is the person that is predicted to lose.  Judging by the media, McCain is definitely the underdog like the New York Giants in the last superbowl, the US in the Revolutionary War, and Gandhi.<br>  <br>  Edit: Didn't the underdog win in the tortoise and the hare too? Don't you people read either?|`|1BwxsUH6aa	First of all, you cannot believe the polls. OMG, this is so funny how many people think the polls really mean something. He will not be losing until the election night but only if he is behind. Bush was shown to be behind Kerry at this time in the race and so was The Greatest president of all, Ronald Reagan, and guess what, the polls were wrong.<br>   Just for your info, McCain and Palin will clean his communist clock for him in 20 days baby, Twenty days baby and Communist, Terrorist sympathizer Barrack Hussein Obama goes down!!|`|3WINphDEaa	The term "underdog" is an appellation typically associated with someone that is not expected to win..... so you had to ask the question because...?|`|n66Zq4Wiaa	That's only his recent dubbing ... lol ... in many popular movies ... the underdog wins ... he's testing the Disney philosphy ... |`|fqH5sySCaa	Obama is the Under-dog! <br>  <br>  Remember he has been coined "that one."|`|xG2wR4xlaa	The word is"losing", but it is not lost for either one till Nov. 4th.

He said, "It's time to be patriotic ... time to jump in, time to be part of the deal, time to help get America out of the rut."  <br>  <br>  He was referring to the fact that it's time the very wealthy paid their fair share of taxes.  Bush's tax cuts only benefited (and continue to benefit) the richest 2% of the country.  <br>  <br>  The Boston Tea Party was about taxation without representation, and was in response to the Stamp Act.|`|6nS62bB8aa	The answer is that all polititions (and wealthy people) don't earn a living from taxable income. They use taxable income to cover living expenses, but the real "weaith" is derived from other investmets-search "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" for a basic understanding.<br>  <br>  Additionally, politicians have always talked about raising taxes on the rich becaus it sells well with the poverty class in America. They like to raise taxes on income because they have wealth outside of "income."|`|k6hicodfaa	You have representation on the state level both through your senators and your local Representative.

Did you know messiah also bought the rights to the song "movin' on up" and is said to change the national anthem?<br>  <br>  Liberals raise taxes because they dont pay them. It's like in my state where we have the biggest azz clowns in the US "Kennedy & Kerry" along with their pet pig Duval Patric AKA brother of messiah. They hike the state taxes every year in some shape or form but do not care as it creates more spending for them and they do not pay state tax due to the exemption of ther office. Liberals always think they can spend money better than the American people and as history shows, every country who does screws things up beyond controle.<br>  <br>  The idea to vote for messiah is beyond my own thinking. The majority of votes will come from the younger people who know nothing about what they stand for or people who think Kieth Olbermann is some kind a factual basis to support there ideology......................<br>  <br>  You would think with the way congress is and how when the nazicrats took over gas went up an average of 4.2 cents per gallon that the last thing Americans wanted was to put another pig in office.

It is a corporate <br>  'profits' tax. It will not be 'passed on'. If corporations could raise their prices they already would have done so.

They want government to give them land, give them breaks, give them leases, etc all to do business that "will help the local economy" while they move jobs OUT of country, give NOTHING back to society and when push comes to shove they pick up and move after making sure to collapse the entire city's economy.<br>  <br>  This is globalization 101 where we give huge companies freedom from laws, from taxes, and after the area is dependent the company leaves to go to another cheaper area collapsing everything.<br>  <br>  Now bigger companies USED to use the lower taxes to increase profit to hire more workers, increase capital, R+D, etc but now since 75% of all company profit goes to the top 3 officers the entire theory you referance is no longer valid.....I wish it was but it isn't|`|ybsKPfcdaa	Actually, the tax is shared between the shareholders and the consumers except in cases where demand for a company's product is highly inelastic and so they can (and will) pass the entire tax on to the consumer.<br>  <br>  In the case of a commodity, most of the tax is absorbed by the shareholders.|`|68dqtQDLaa	They also lose because the more a corporation has to give to the government, the less they have for bonuses, raises, new hires, plant/facility expansion and the worse their stock performs which affects every ones retirement plans, (all things which generate other forms off tax income to the fed).

Mine was one dollar and forty cents a WEEK.  Raising taxes on corporations may raise prices on some things but I haven't noticed a price reduction on anything since Bush's tax CUTS, have you?  Damn!  Just think what fuel would be if not for the tax cuts to Exxon huh?  *LOL*  By the way, you have a choice of where to buy products.  Someone will sell for less to make a profit.

Here are two truths.  1. Obama will let the Bush tax cuts expire...that means a tax increase for everyone.  2. Tax cuts always generate more money to the treasury.  A classic example is the state of Michigan.  It has raised taxes and are in the poor house while low and moderately taxing states are doing fine.<br>  <br>  Corporations sell things.

Why is this important? Obama sat on both boards. Through his board positions, he was able to assist in the funneling of many millions of dollars in grant money to various ultra-liberal organizations like Chicago’s ACORN. It may not be illegal but it gives me pause.<br>  <br>  It would be illegal for Obama to funnel money to his main “get out the vote” volunteers in his position on those boards. So it would seem, at least on the exterior, that ACORN probably did observe the “rule of law” in its non-partisan efforts. It claims that its get-out-the-vote drives are segregated from its political arm. I am certain that much grant money has been received from these two foundations. And I am left with a nagging question. Where does ACORN get the money for its never-empty war chest? Could it be they receive funding from someone like George Soros, who has poured millions into presidential campaigns like Obama and even Howard Dean, according to a blog piece at No Quarter, “Hitler and the New Democratic Party.”<br>  Obama uses one organization who stated they then took the 800,000 dollars of Obama's campaign fund and they split it with Acorn. SO Obama covers his a-- by stating I didn't exchange money with them they recieved it from the other organization. Obama thinks he is smart man a (Lawyer) sleaze bag who knows you cannot associate him as long as he did not directly give the money to Acorn.<br>  ACORN is being exposed for what they have always been: Another criminal activity outlet for the anti-American (democrat) party. The fascinating aspect is the anti-American party seems not to care about the exposure. Their corruption, fraud, and criminality is so entrenched and common, they act as if no one should be surprised….and they are right. No one is surprised.<br>  <br>  Since the left and their anti-American party have given up all pretenses of civilty and decency, no disgusting mode of operation or ugly illegal tactic is off the table. Their goal to force Barack Hussein Obama down the public’s throat at any and all costs is all-consuming. I do know why normal folks aren’t, at this point, loudly up-in-arms - it is not their style. The outrage of the decent and good Americans is out there, though. It will show itself. <br>  <br>  Election Day is going to be a shocker for the left and their anti-American party. Obama’s defeat will be sound. When the cheating, voter intimidation, fraud, and usual democrat shenanigans are figured in, Obama’s loss will be historic.

Substantially more of the outlays occur in 2012 or later than occur in 2009.  How is this stimulus spending?    One argument is that we expect this to be a very long-lasting recession, so were going to need this stimulus spending in 2011, 2012, and so on.  But, consider that if were heading into a Japan 1990s style decade-long slowdown, this kind of spending is exactly what they tried, and it sure didnt work in that case.     So, if this is a normal length recession, the spending bill will have the classic problem that fiscal stimulus doesnamely, it comes too late to do much good, but right on time to help stoke inflation and mis-allocation of resources that are suddenly in high demand as the economy enters a recovery.  And if this is a very long-lasting recession, more like a U.S. 1930s Depression or Japan 1990s lost decade, then the problem is so long-lasting that were not really debating a stimulus bill, were debating a near-permanent shift of control of resources to the government, which doesnt exactly have a sterling track record of success. Only if this is a Goldilocks-length recession of more than 1-2 years, but less than a decade (which is a pretty hard beast to find in modern American history) would this temporal spending pattern turn out to be wise.    Next, consider how the $604 billion of outlays would be spent.     Its easy to go through a huge proposal and find what seem like fairly ridiculous line items, so Ill focus on as comprehensive a view as I can of the spending. The CBO reviews each Title (basically, spending area) of the bill, and calls out major items within each Title. Here are all the items that I saw them identify as individual programs with more than $10 billion of projected outlays, in the order that they call them out:        $20.0 billion to increase the maximum benefit under the Supplemental Nutrition Assurance Program (i.e., Food Stamps)        $18.5 billion for energy efficiency and renewable energy programs        $20.4 billion for programs administered by the Department of health and Human  Services        $20.0 billion to renovate elementary and secondary schools        $17.6 billion for Pell grants and other student financial assistance at post-secondary institutions        $29.1 billion for other elementary and secondary educational programs        $30.0 billion for highway construction        $13.1 billion for other transportation programs        $11.2 billion for housing assistance programs administered by HUD        $19.5 billion (minimum, could be higher, as per Title XIII) for education grants to states        $27.1 billion for increase unemployment benefits        $13.3 billion to increase health insurance for unemployed workers        $11.1 billion for Other Unemployment Compensation        $20.2 billion for Medicaid and Medicare incentive payments to encourage providers to improve healthcare IT    What does this sound like to you?

EDIT:  And yes, I have seen a more divisive President.  George Bush.  He managed to fracture his own party toward the end of his last term.  That's why the Governor's Conference consisted mostly of discussion among Republican governors as to how they need to change the party platform in order to have a chance at winning future elections.

What a sham!<br>  <br>  He immediately announced that no riders should be added to the bailout plan, like any help for the actual home-owners at risk or facing bankruptcy.

WgIZUcYfaa	My husband is stationed at Fort Lewis. I was raised in Washington State. Washington is beautiful. Base housing isn't all that great in some parts. Lakewood and Tacoma have high crime rates (city around base). University Place (where we live) is nice. Olympia is the capital, its a half hour away, its gorgeous down there. We are moving down there as soon as our lease is up. You're also not far from Mt. Rainier. If you like outdoorsy things then request this duty station. If you don't then you are better off requesting somewhere else because more than likely you wont like it. There are also lots of things to do in Seattle. Which is an forty minutes to an hour away depending on traffic. Downtown Tacoma is also pretty neat. Good hunting and fishing. Look on craigslist.com for a house. I wouldn't want to live on base having it just be you two. Housing allowance is $1200. Most places (one and two bedroom) rent around here between $600 and $800. Good luck! Hope everything works out well!|`|4582a857fe73584c0fff40c4f1537198aa	LEWIS|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	COL in the Hampton Roads/Alexandria VA area is really high.  Long commute times if you wish to live some place you can really afford.  (Right now, folks are living in W. Virginia [!| and commuting a couple hours each way-due to the prices closer to DC.)  Seattle/Ft Lewis is a little more affordable.|`|jlrb0ZXoaa	dont know about the others but traffic is a "B" around fort lewis. tho i hear its nice.|`|Ln5XNno3aa	Fort Lewis is the highest requested duty station in the Army. Yes traffic sucks but its not any better, in the Military district Washington (D.C) area. I am from WA State and the Area is beautiful, you are 30-40 minutes from Seattle, in general there is allot to do and keep you busy there.|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	VA is a great place and those two posts are outside of DC.  I live in Seattle and have lived all over the country and Lewis is the place to be.  Yeah the traffic can be a pain at times.  However if you love the outdoors you won't find a better place in the military to be stationed.  The Army is full of crappy posts and this is not one of them!|`|hjLXy56qaa	a friend of mine lived in fort lewis she said she hated it when they were there but now she really misses it|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	I am from Virginia, and I think Fort Eustis is 1 of a ton of military bases in Hampton Roads. They don't have a very good reputation. Hampton Roads just has a ton of military bases, mostly Navy.    Seattle and Washington state has nice people so you should go there. It rains a whole whole lot there. You'll see what I mean when you get there!|`|SkWzsnuxaa	Now that is tough. As you know all the jobs are practically the same no matter where you are. A mechanic is still a mechanic, so you are really asking about the base and the surrounding area. Fort Belvoir is a beautiful base to live on and if you can't get on base housing, which is all privatized, then you will get a pretty good BAH. The best part of being at Belvoir is that you can drive two miles north and park at a metro station and go anywhere in DC for fun or touring. Each time we have been there, loads of people have come to visit and we gave them tours of the city. Also you aren't far from beaches and mountains for hiking and skiing. If you enjoy touring battlefields you couldn't ask for a better location. The downside for Belvoir is the traffic if you don't live on base. I'll let other talk about Eustis and Lewis as I have not been stationed there. Good luck in choosing!|`|zGVVxuFLaa	They've all got pros and cons.  Fort Eustis is in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia (about 3 hours from DC, on the coast).  I've heard that the housing at Fort Eustis is really in a state of transition.  You'd be 30-45 minutes from the oceanfront, a little over an hour to Richmond.  It is a beautiful area with a lot to do.  Four distinct seasons and not a lot of snow in the winter.    Fort Belvoir has the benefits and disadvantages of being right outside of DC.  There is tons of culture available.  Traffic can be rough sometimes.  Depending on whether you plan to live on or off base, you might have a long commute.  There are four distinct seasons with a remarkably hot summer and often nasty, icy winter storms.    Fort Lewis is definitely the most beautiful place, but very rainy and gray for most of the year.  Traffic is shockingly bad.  The greater Seattle-Tacoma area is full of artsy stuff and outdoor activities.|`|9rEI0TnUaa	Either Belvoir of Eustis.  If you like being near a coastal area choose Eustis.   If you want to be in a high class suburd of Washington, DC choose Belvoir.    The only thing I've heard about Lewis is that it rains a lot there.

It's a person that wants to make a difference in our society.....just like many minorities today like to do so their children grow up and are treated just like everybody around them.    http://www.venturacountystar.com/news/20...  What's fueling increase in violence against Latinos?    The poisonous residue of immigrant scapegoating has accumulated in the margins, fueling the rise of hate groups setting their sights on Latinos, regardless of citizenship status.    In such a polarized environment, where Latinos are racially profiled and immigrants are dehumanized and persecuted as "illegals," and "criminal aliens," the hate-filled and the weak-minded will rally to the cause in their own violent way. Only if the new generation of politicians listens to the majority  and those who stand for human rights and legalization continue to push for it  the voices of divisiveness will be truly marginalized.
AA11494150	A discarded gun is certainly worth the trouble of fingerprinting. The officer has no way of knowing what type of crimes the gun may have been used in.     If your brother is identified, I fail to see how he thinks he would beat this unless he had a reasonable explanation on why his prints were on the gun.|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Umm, your post says nothing about the important details of the case, such as where the gun was (if ever) found and after how long, why he was being chased, for how long and how good a look did the cops get at your brother.  Is your brother recognizable?  I don't see this as a case your brother can get away from easily, and he may end up not beating it at all.    Many big cities treat firearms differently than other evidence.  When somebody is arrested for possessing a gun, they will engage in intelligence analysis - where did the gun come from, who sold it, where, etc.  Ofcourse they will test it ballistically, so taking prints doesn't sound so out of the question.    If your brother is already in the system for something else, then his prints will be matched up.|`|FhyYpuiUaa	... there has to be more to this story than what you are telling.    Why did your brother have a gun?  Why did the police stop him?  Why did your brother run?  What do your brother do in order for police to notice him?

Unhealthy police attitudes towards the public have had a habit of backfiring over the years.   Police are charged with enforcing civil law. They are not military in spite of what you might see of late. Most civil laws are designed to make our environment a safer place to live. The supreme civil law of our land is the Constitution and government employees swear to obey, protect, preserve and defend the Constitution in an oath of some form. When the general public is not respected and peoples' rights are not respected, the result is a lack of respect towards the police. Given most police are good, right thinking folks, it only takes a few to damage the reputation of the rest. When the police are utilized for 'revenue enhancement'...writing citations and making arrests enforcing the 'letter of the law' as opposed to using good judgment and enforcing the 'spirit of the law' for the revenue stream provided to city and county governments; when their unnecessary arrests are to provide numbers for re-election campaigns;  when they rationalize that they are 'just doing their job' because they are preforming as instructed by their superiors in conflict with what is morally and ethical right respectt for them usually wanes.

He walked over to the homeless person and gave him directions to the welfare office. He then reached into the Republican's pocket and gave the homeless person fifty dollars.<br>  <br>  Now you understand the difference between Republicans and Democrats<br>  |`|DQpPRg9caa	The yanks haven't worked out that the question is about British political parties.<br>  <br>  <br>  I reality all the three main British parties follow varieties of conservatism- pro-Israeli, pro-mass immigration to drive down wages and financed by the same sort of people.|`|4XQw0oT4aa	If I had a choice, I would prefer the middle ground but there is no such thing, unfortunately|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Liberal Democrats-Big government. Government is responsible for solving all our problems.<br>  Conservatives-Smaller government, fewer controls on us. Feels that people should take responsibility for themselves.<br>  <br>  Middleground: Independent. A person who rides the fence right up until election day...then votes his conscience.|`|jLxBvXZ5aa	I am a conservative leaning moderate.  I can tell you that I believe it takes a mix of capitalism with a touch of the socialism we have lived with since Roosevelt.  The one thing we should have learned is that pure anything is not workable.<br>  <br>  By that I mean wholly socialistic drives down the initiative to succeed.  True capitalism does not ensure a  little help to the elderly, or disabled.  So falling somewhere in between we need to find a balance. Far left Liberalism is radical, and so is the far right.  When we have a candidate that will work with both sides of the political spectrum, who has experience and knowledge and known patriotism, and knows how to find that balance, I feel that should be our choice.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion. Thanks.<br>  <br>  ~
