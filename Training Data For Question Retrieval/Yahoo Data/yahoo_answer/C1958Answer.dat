Check out Diamond and Pearl for Nintendo DS!!!|`|181d777e6c674ff88a0e6b17266afc98aa	Pokemon is Owned by Nintendo and unless they hook up with Sony there wont be a Pokemon game for PSP or any Sony games|`|f1a0603e523636d2e54b17b72eb67f2eaa	if u really like Pokemon, then u seriously bought the wrong handheld system! of course Pokemon isn't available for psp! Pokemon is the property of Nintendo, therefore Pokemon games are only available to the following handhelds:<br>  1. game boy advance<br>  2. game boy advance sp<br>  3. game boy color<br>  4. Nintendo game cube<br>  5. Nintendo ds or Nintendo ds lite<br>  6.

Additionally,  a used nintendo ds @ ebgames, gamecrazy, etc. for a used or new system is about $70-80 plus tax.

I Had That Happen To My System. Call PlayStation Support The Number Should Be On The Machine And They Can Tell You Where The Closet Repair Shop is. In My Area It Cost About $30.00 To Replace But It Could Cost More Or Less In Your Area So Just Call The Support and Repair Number Located On Your Machine Or Call A Game Dealer In Your Area!<br>  <br>  Or It Could Be That The Disk Is Scratched!<br>  If There Is A Scratch On The Front Of The Disk <br>  It Won't Play And Most Likely Can't Be Fixed!<br>  <br>  If The Disk Has The Black Coating On The Back And That Gets Scratch Most Likely That Can't Be Fixed Ether.<br>  <br>  You Can Try Taking The Disks To Get The Scratches Off At Your Local Game Store Or Video Store.

I just went to walmart and bought a cleaning disc for PS2 and that did the trick. Also, make sure your discs aren't scratched or smugged...that might be your problem................If still nothing works contact Sony and they will replace it free if it's a technical difficulty.|`|f4L6T2Lraa	Try using many different discs.

RyvKws7Laa	The Sharp Aquos line is a very good LCD line.  Currently Sony is buying their LCD panels from Sharp (they are using the Sharp Aquos panels).  Sony does add its own chip and what not, but the panel is the Sharp panel.  $1200 for a 46" TV is pretty sweet though.  My only concern would be the refresh rate, I can't find a spec for that.  You want 120Hz LCD if you can afford it.  60Hz LCDs aren't great for fast motion (sports or action movies).  120Hz helps improve the motion blur issues.    Samsung though is considered the cream of the crop in panels and picture quality (in LCD).  In Plasma reviews they use Samsung LCDs as the LCD in the mix (not that they really hold up against the Plasma, but its considered LCDs best foot forward in those tests).|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Sharp is a good brand but I would suggest Samsung over Sharp.Try Samsung LN46A550 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV for $1133 with higher contrast ratio.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001417...|`|QC5ZfICJaa	buy sharp no madder what i have one of the first lcd sharp ever introduced and it is still working. i also have the 46' aquos like u asked about. and i would highly recommend it. name brand does matter most no name last a short lifetime.
j4erzRM2aa	it is impossible to get a phone for 30 bucks, even a RAZR costs about 90 still. check ebay.|`|dkTAZmKSaa	you can go to wal-mart or target and get a cheap go phone.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Where do you live? Here in California (I believe it's also in Texas and Nevada) we have a company called Metro PCS. They have unlimited local and long distance for $40 a month and I'm sure that you can get a phone there for cheap, or if you have an old Verizon phone or one without service they can switch it over. Or, you can go to walmart and buy an at&t one for as little as $15 for the phone and reload the minutes as you need them. I have the at&t phone with no contract and pay $30 a month.|`|R4WX5twzaa	Walmart has a pretty good selection of pre-paid phones. I know of one specific Verizon phone that's $30, and then $15, $30, or $50 for the phone card (depending on how many minutes you want). But that's Verizon and Verizon is expensive, and you can probably get a GoPhone or T-Mobile or something for much cheaper. All sold at Walmart, so check there.|`|NhwqTeKTaa	check out "Net 10" for 10 cents a minute phones.  No contract  but must keep the minute bank from going empty or owner loses their phone number. I've had one for 4 months now and its much cheaper to maintain than one of the big name company phones. See then=m on the web for a good explanation. phones are available at wal-mart and k-mart stores.
b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	nope, only 20 GB drives can be copied to another drive, but you can transfer individual files with memory cards

Xxviy63Paa	I knew you would hear it from the wasd die-hards.    Call of Duty doesn't require a joystick, no. There is practically no shooter on pc that can't be played with a keyboard and mouse. It's much more common to find a shooter that can ONLY be played with a keyboard and mouse.    But since Call of Duty 4 is multiplatform, you can be sure that it has joystick support. You'd do better to get a console-style gamepad than use a flight-stick, though. A gamepad has the serious advantage of 2-axis motion and look control. Though you may not be able to aim quite as quickly as you could with a mouse, precise 2-d analog movement with the other thumbstick more than makes up for this - particularly since moving is part of aiming in a fps arena.   Plus, you get plenty of configurable buttons, meaning you'll never screw up when you are going through some complex series of moves, jump, crawl, crouch, zoom, use item, etc.    If you want to use a single-axis joystick, you probably can, but if so the best thing to do would be to use it for movement, and use the mouse for view. Then you'd get the best of both worlds, except you wouldn't have as many buttons as a gamepad does.     For games that don't have versatile joystick support, you can get around that by using a keypress emulator, which you can find with a search engine easily. These convert joystick actions into keyboard events, unfortunately you wouldn't have the analog advantage, just digital "move" or "not move" at one of 2 or 3 speeds, like it is on keyboard control.    I recommend a sony dualshock 2 with usb adapter, or a sixaxis, or an xbox360 controller with the plug and play adapter.    key-and-mouse is not the control system of choice on pc's because it's better, only because it's the "hip" control method. This is because 3d shooters started out on pc when there was no such thing as a 4-axis analog gamepad yet. Some people are used to that and never learned the advantages of 2-stick control. But not most. Look at console shooter sales, compared to sales of the pc versions.|`|ykXzzx65aa	nope|`|NfsGPniJaa	no why would you make your life harder than it already is? the joystick is g@y|`|R7syphCpaa	PC First Person Shooter games are better than their console counterparts because of the the use of the mouse for aiming.      ....no, to answer your question.|`|MGyzOIKqaa	no

D8BDhIGwaa	You need to softmod UnleashX or EvoX dashboards onto your Xbox before you can install Linux or XBMC or anything else onto your old console.    The link below explains how to do this.    If you have the correct copy of Mech Assault, you just need the Mech Assault gamesave and the Modification gamesave (2 in total) copied onto your Xbox.  You can do this with a memory card and either Action Replay or Xploder/Game Shark memory card save devices that run from your PC.    I've used Xploder and Xploder Lite to do it (because they were a bit cheaper to buy on eBay than Action Replay).    Very simple process once you've copied the files onto the Xbox, and is better than dumping the old Xbox into a landfill!
fwnqB0dTaa	In the UK they are but I don't have a clue about the rest of the world.|`|mjsS54JXaa	Yes its legal, but first you need the phone to be unlocked.

hqBX1i97aa	O sistema de posicionamento global (GPS) é um sistema de navega??o que consiste em uma rede de satélites girando em órbita da terra. Eles est?o a uma distancia de 20.000 km da terra, em seis diferentes planos de órbita, dando duas voltas em torno da terra a cada 24 horas. Os satélites de GPS s?o chamados de NAVSTAR.<br>  <br>  Os satélites foram criados para uso militar, com evolu??o das utiliza??es em 1980, o presidente Ronald Regan autorizou para uso civil, porém por motivo de seguran?a com um erro de 100 m. Hoje praticamente todos os receptores do mercado apresentam uma precis?o de no mínimo 15 m. O GPS (global positioning system) equipamento que usamos no barco, carro, ou avi?o, pode ser fixo ou portátil, é um receptor que recebe os sinais transmitidos pelos satélites, com isso temos a posi??o certa onde estamos em qualquer lugar do mundo, em coordenadas geográficas.<br>  <br>  Ent?o, n?o importa onde vc está, ou onde comprou seu GPS.

OdQPLitqaa	Your phone company might not have an agreement with their phone company.  You might want to log on to your company's website and search for international texting; the website might let you know who you can text to.  If all else fails, call customer service and they can look into it for you.|`|yXo4Wb9Oaa	I gather you meant to say you send text messages from one country to the phillipines and they don't receive them.....<br>  <br>  do you send text message anywhere else overseas or make calls overseas? if you don't check with your phone compnay if you have an international call barring or if there is a fault on your phones computer connection via your network provider (just ask them the question you asked above - a reasonably experienced operator should be able to check it out...) - if all ok ask them to refresh your record on the computer  - what they do is change the barring to local calls only them change it back to allow overseas calls... and see if this fixes it...<br>  <br>  can they send text messages to you?<br>  <br>  can they receive them from other people - both overseas and locally ? (maybe they haven't enough memory on their phone to receive any more messages....  if they have a flashing envelope on their phone they need to clear some messages.... yes I know this is an obvious one but I forget the number of times I have fixed a problem with this one..)<br>  <br>  as the prev. person said check if your mobile company has an agreement with their company re the sending of SMS - some don't - not many but some - enough to be annoying! ask your carrier's customer support area when you call about the international barring... (they may have barred it on your request or when you were connected as standard so that theives cannot make a big bill if they steal your phone - also an occasional problem... can cost you a fortune...!).<br>  <br>  any other queztions feel free to email me  to ask - you can send me a test text if you want!!! and see if I get it...lol....   send to:<br>  +61438126661 - australia - will cost you the same as sending a local text [depending on your carrier of course but shouldn't be a differnet cost...]..<br>  <br>  Best of luck....

Tengo un amigo gerente de una tienda de videojuegos (gamestop) y le llegan dos envios por semana de tres piezas cada envio.  Los vende el mismo dia que le llegan.  A penas los pone en el mostrador y se venden, ademas de que tienen la obligacion de solo vender una consola por cliente.  Tienes que tener mucha suerte de encontrar uno en existencia.  En cambio, el PS3 y el 360 tienen hasta de sobra.  Esto es en dos tiendas que el es el encargado, en la misma ciudad sucede lo mismo, wallmart solo recibe 6 o 10 por semana con el mismo resultado.

If the songs will play on your computer but not your ipod then plug in your ipod and use the restore option on the ipod tab in itunes and wait while the software is re-installed in your ipod and your music is copied over again. Hopefully you will have more joy that way.|`|Dl2HCWMnaa	ya call Apple and complain|`|vRCS4owraa	probably<br>  <br>  or the songs you purchased were not through the music store and they were fake and programmed to skip so that they get money for nothing<br>  <br>  call apple and complain and ask why
