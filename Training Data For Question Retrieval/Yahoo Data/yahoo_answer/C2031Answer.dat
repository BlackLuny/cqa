eaf6e6cc3a70b3bd99fb1d80d77ece28aa	The dropped likely caused the powersupply to be damaged. It sounds to me like you need it to be repaired. There is no such thing as an easy-fix. If you really want to get it repaired send it to a repair facility. If you want it under warranty send it to Canon, but they will likely notice if it was impacted. In which case you will be charged.    If you don't care about spending money to get it repaired then you should be able to find some places that can repair Canon Cameras.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Well...if you cannot get the camera to turn on, then I think you should return the camera to where you bought it...or if it was a christmas present from someone, I sure hope they kept the receipt?    I hope you can get a replacement (just don't tell them you dropped it)...and if you do get a new one, please be very careful with it...even though it's made of metal, doesn't mean it's unbreakable.   Good luck

AA12020041	For Videos On Your PSP:    First download one of these video converters: Rapiz (free)  Video Encoder Original Program Page Translated Program Page (for downloads click on the "unloadings" tap) Direct Download 3GP (free) - Video Encoder Looking for Original Program Page Direct Download PSP Video 9 (free)  Video Encoder Original Program Page Direct Download    I recommend you to download PSP Video 9. The best converter for the psp is pspvideo9.com. I will now explain the psp video system. 1.The pspvideo9 converter inserts the MSV tag needed for the psp to recogonize the video.(The MSV tag is sort of a secondary name for the video.) 3.When converted, the videos file name is change to M4V10001 and the original name is added to the MSV tag. 4.The M4V10001 file name is what the psp recognizes as the files format and how it is listed in the folder. 5.Once the psp regonizes the M4V1 filename it will then recgonize the MSV tag and use it as the display name. Without the proper file name M4V10001 and the MSV tag the psp system will not recgonise it and will not display it. 6.As long as the video has been converted to mp4 format and has the MSV tag embeded in it, the M4V10001 file name can be change manually when downloaded to the psp. 7.There are two diffrent filenames for the video depending on which audio format the video has been converted to. It will either be M4V10001 or MAQ10001. The filename can be renamed like this: M4V10001, M4V10002, ect. As long as its name includes M4V1****/MAQ1**** the last 4 digits can be any number from 0-9. 8.Where to save this file is in the MProot folder, either the MNV one or the ANV folder. It should be inserted into the MNV folder if its a M4V1**** beacause it is converted to SP audio format. It should be inserted into ANV folder if its a MAQ1**** beacuse it is converted to AVC audio format. I hope this detailed guide has helped you to understand how the video system on the psp works.    Here is another way:  - Install PSPVideo9, don't uncheck AVISynth during installation.    1) Open the Setup tab, Profiles tab.  (a) Click New Profile, and name it something like PSP1, or PSP.  Video Settings.  (b) AVC > CBR.  (c) Resolution: 368X208 Is 16:9 aspect ratio. 320X240 is 4:3 aspect ratio.  (d) Passes: 1.  (e) Bitrate: 512kbps. 192Kbps is respectable, but a bit darker and blockier in some parts.  (f) Framerate: 29.97fps.  (g) Keyframe interval: 250.  (h) Aspect ratio: 1:1.  (i) Audio bitrate: 48kbps.  (j) Stereo.  (k) Volume: 500%  (l) Click apply.    2) Open the settings tab.  (a) Click One-click Profile and scroll to the profile you created, click that profile.  (b) On your computer create a folder called MP_ROOT, and in this folder create another folder called 100ANV01 (Those are zero's). Output video's to the 100ANV01 folder you created. This is a important step.  (c) File name is from MAQ00001 up to MAQ99999. Change the number for every video you convert.  (d) Default copy folder: AVC.  (e) Click save.    3) Open the convert tab.  (a) Click new Transcode new video.  (b) Open the Movie folder.  (c) Make sure your Quality profile name you created is selected. The title name should not be changed.  (d) Click the Start button. Your video will be converted to MP4 now. It'll take about 3 hours for a 2 hour video. The progress bar will fill up Way before it's finished, just wait till it says "No jobs queued".  (e) In the MP_ROOT folder on the PSP, you need a 100ANV01 folder to put the video in.    A 132 minute video will take about 580MB using the 512kbps video bitrate, about 420MB using 384kbps video bitrate.  512kbps video bitrate displays shadows better than the 384kbps video bitrate. Some say 192kbps is the average for decent picture quality, using AVC    !!!Or you can just upload the video and press convert,then copy to psp.( this is for psp video 9!!!    -    1. Format your memory stick if you haven't done so already.  2. Once you have your movie ready, turn on your psp.  3. Go to USB mode. 4. Hook up USB cable.  5. Open icon that appears on desktop.(Probably titled "untitled" )  6. Create a new folder titled MP_ROOT in "untitled".  7. Create another folder titled 100MNV01(OR 100ANV01 for AVC Movies) and put it in the MP_ROOT folder.  8. Place both the MP4 and THM files in 100MNV01.(OR 100ANV01 for AVC movies)  9. When videos are done uploading to the memory stick, close window , eject "untitled" and unhook USB cable.    Note: There are only two video format that the psp can read:    * MP4  o MPEG-4 Simple Profile (AAC)  o H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Main Profile (CABAC) (AAC) and Baseline Profile (AAC)  o Videos must be in either AVC or MP4 format.    If you have firmware version 2.81 you can save converted videos in a video folder.    How to get Youtube videos on your psp    VIDEO LINKAGE      I have seen countless tutorials on how to download YouTube videos. Most are quite complicated, and require quite some time. But, I have a solution for you. It's very simple, and is all done without you have to pester about anything.    1. Go to YouTube. Choose a video that you enjoy, and copy the link that YouTube gives you. For example, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mBGODdzz...  2. Now, go to VeniVideo. (I did not create VeniVideo. I am only linking to it for you to use as a resource)  3. Paste the URL you copied from YouTube into the text box as displayed on VeniVideo.  4. Now hit options. Then choose the format for which you want the video to be converted into. If you plan on using it on your PSP, and you are not worried about space (however the files are not very big), I would suggest choosing  "High Quality PS|`|9cd7cb4efc80d9142ec108ab4fee0fa1aa	Have to be converted to MP4 not AVI, try download.com to find one.

61a37b9d57dafca6c28bc8405ccfbd1aaa	hi mario! if u have quicktime pro, there is an export option built right in for converting videos for ipod - "Movie to iPod" export option.  the correct encoding is mpeg-4, and the file types should be *.m4v or *.mp4.  *.mov might work as well if encoded as mpeg-4.     if u do not have quicktime pro (it's like $30 to upgrade to pro), i have a tip - u can do this with a free program called "mpeg streamclip": http://www.squared5.com/    i am just starting to use this program myself and i really like it so far. play around with it for a few minutes using a super short video. the reviews of the program are awesome, and here's a quote from their website which confirms this is what ur looking for:    "MPEG Streamclip is compatible with the Apple iPod 5G. Use the MPEG-4 exporter to make MP4 video files that can be easily imported in your iPod!"    once u get mpeg streamclip converting ur videos to the appropriate mp4 encoding, simply drag the converted video files into ur itunes library, then sync ur ipod and there u go!    i have a video podcast and i use quicktime pro to encode my videos for ipod - check em out and see what they look like on ur ipod video! pretty please ;)  just subscribe for FREE on itunes: http://phobos.apple.com/webobjects/mzsto...    xo,  Betty  http://www.averagebetty.com|`|F7jTmFpSaa	Try TubeHunter Ultra which downloads Music/Audios and videos from hundreds of video sharing webs to any format you want.      ===========================  TubeHunter Ultra downloads YouTube/Myspace/Metacafe/Dailymotion videos to PC/iPOD/PSP/ZUNE/MOBILE  Homepage of TubeHunter - "www.neoretix dot com"|`|DF3c8Wuwaa	You must make sure the video is mp4 format for iPod.

This weekend, I forgot my wall adapter (leftover from my Zen touch, which is also compatible with the Vision), and attempted to charge it via my car and my computer. Needless to say, it was more than a little stubborn. In the car, it merrily gave it enough boost to maintain power (I let my battery get to almost dead by that time :( ), and my computer was more than happy to do music/vid transfers and such, but didnt give it much of a boost.  Your best charging bet would be to obtain a standard ac/dc wall adapter for it from Creative.  The converstion rate used is one not found on Universal adapters.

Then wash it off and use light soft smooth material like nylon rag or silk, camera lens rag to clear of the surface and wash it again then dry off with the same rag and your done.

In any case, put the cleaner on your cloth first, not on the CD itself.    1.Hold the disc by its edges and center hole.  2.Use an anti-static cloth to wipe across the CD with your other hand.  3.Work from inside to outside in straight lines, not circles.

It is for a micro SD chip which is for storage just like on our computer.  It stores songs, pictures, videos, etc.    Verizon Wireless does not use SIM's in any of their phones.    More than likely if the phone had been reported lost or stolen by the original owner to Verizon they will have it on a lost/stolen list (I have Verizon and had done this).  This is just a nice safety feature that Verizon offers it's customers so if the someone tries to use the phone or activate it on the Verizon network it will come up on their report.  What you can do is write down the serial number and ESN number under the battery, put the battery back in, turn on the phone and dial 611.  This will connect you to Verizon and you can let them know that you found the phone.  Or you can get it to your local police department and let them know you found the phone.  Or lastly, you can do absolutely nothing.  It's your choice.    Hope this helps!|`|3XPYDq1Paa	Well, since Razrs dont use sim cards, you could take it to a verizon wireless store and buy a plan for it, and they will program it for you.|`|Rqr5ORbLaa	lol razrs do use sim cards but verizon doesnt!!!    well for one the network that verizon uses is CDMA and they dont use sim cards in any of there phones is why it doesnt look like a som would go there.... but there is really nothing u can do with it because ven if u knew someone who had verizon, they would have to call and verify the phone and if they reported it stolen then it definitely will not work but if u have a razr with at&t maybe u can use the battery as a spare battery!!! lol! but anyway the phone is useless to you!!|`|ejDd2NYLaa	Chances are if you found it someone has already reported it lost or stolen with Verizon. Once it is on that list it does you no good as far as using it with them. I know how awsome it is to find a treasure like that and I am not telling you what to do. But I am sure the owner would appreciate it if you brought it to a verizon store so they don't have to fork out 300 bucks to buy a new one. Karma baby. What comes around goes around.Good luck with your moral decision:)

Next - the only 5 amp outlets I have ever come across have three small round pins and look like this :-      http://www.screwfix.com/search.do;jsessi...       You need to check if this is what is fitted in your student room and if it is you will need to get someone to change the 13 amp plug on the kettle lead to one like this : -    http://www.screwfix.com/search.do;jsessi...      better check the plugs on any other electrical equipment your taking - hairdryer ??  - Iron ?? etc.    *

Just key in the actual speed you want the plane to travel up to 1200 mph.  Use the zero key to slow the plane down.  Use the star key to take the plane into DIVE MODE.  I tried that once it was cool.  Use the pound key to straighten the plane and pull out of dive mode.  I wouldn't try it unless you really know what you're doing and you alert all crew and passengers.

This whole issue was in the news about two weeks ago.    Say stupid things like "I have no dial tone", or "When I done making a call, how do I hang up?"|`|rvtOlXMDaa	There are ways to cancel service without penalty.  Mainly, if you are within the first 30 days, you can cancel right away (be sure to port your number to another carrier first, or you WILL loose it).  Other ways may have already been presented to you, and have been missed.  For example, a change in the terms and conditions may give you a chance to get out.  If some get changed you are given the chance to terminate without penalty. However, you must read the very, VERY fine print that some with the bills in the mail.  They intentionally make the print hard to read, and obscure.  However, you will have a window of about 30 - 45 days to cancel from the billing date before you are again bound to the cancellation clause of your contract.  If you find a chance to get out, jump on it.  BUT!  When you cancel you MUST tell them the reason you are canceling is due to the change in whatever term or condition.    This does work, I have done it.    Good Luck!|`|kKWe56jDaa	keep calling them and they will drop u|`|5hRYaKAJaa	LOL i don't really have an answer, but the other ones are hilarious.|`|AA11289233	If you know someone else who wants to take over your contract, you could do what's called a Transfer of Liability.  Another option would be to say you're moving to a non-coverage area due to employment..you may then be required to fax proof of your new address, such as a bill showing your new out-of-coverage address, which you can easily falsify using photoshop.  If you are moving out of coverage area due to employment, you have a better chance of having the fee waived.
DHmIEcsVaa	You can try contacting Samsung or your carrier and order one over the phone, or go into your carriers store and buy a USB cable from them. I would not recommend buying one from a place that doesn't sell wireless phones, as it may not fit into your paticular model of phone if you just buy a generic one.     Generally, USB cables are not included with phones.|`|05b30e9890c9a37d12ed815265ae3db8aa	It depends on that where do you live.

ad2faoKcaa	Sony has no choice but to lower the PS3 price because they've pretty much botched every area of the PS3 starting with the high launch price and continuing on with their marketing.<br>  <br>  Unless they can get the PS3 to the $299 price point, the PS3 is dead in the water. They aren't many good games for the system outside of exclusives and the lineup doesn't look that impressive for 2009.<br>  <br>  Sony should have nixed the blu-ray until the PS4 because by that time the drives would have been cheaper thus making the system cheaper and more people would have had time to upgrade to HDTV's to take full advantage of the systems capability.|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	As stated above. Sony won't say they will be having a price cut because then people will stop buying PS3s until the price cut take effect. <br>  <br>  I can almost guarantee that a price cut is coming but we wont know about it until shortly before it happens and maybe not til after the stores change the prices on the shelf..|`|0MuRCU5paa	Only Sony knows so don't believe anything you hear unless its from Sony.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Of course Sony is going to deny it. If they said "Yeah, we're going to cut the price in a few months", no one would buy any PS3s *until the price cut happens*. They certainly don't want that to happen.

Just do an internet search for limewire 4 or something like that. Or go to limewire's site and see if they have links to older versions. Usually when I look for old versions of software, I can find them.<br>  <br>  Utorrent is not a torrent site. It's software for downloading torrents, which once downloaded are in the file type of whatever you've downloaded (i.e. movies will be in avi, wmv, mpg, etc; music usually will be in mp3 format after you complete the torrent download). In order to find torrents to download with software like utorrent, you need to use sites like btjunkie.org. Personally, if I am searching for music, I prefer limewire to torrents (still, I don't use limewire that often anymore)--I think torrents are better when you're looking for movies and tv episodes. I just don't feel like they have enough of certain kinds of music on them, or are as easy to download music with as limewire is. Downloading torrent software is free, and sites that let you search for torrents to download are free. <br>  <br>  I have never used frostwire. I prefer limewire just because it's the most popular program of its kind, meaning more users use it...which means more files will be on it. <br>  <br>  None of these sites are completely safe, and that's why you need a virus program and a spyware program. I have AVG just because if you download a file with a virus in it, a message comes up right away with AVG telling you. With programs like limewire and frostwire, you also have to worry about getting caught engaging in copyright infringement if you're downloading music, movies, etc. There are ways around this with both programs, i.e. setting your settings to make sure you're not sharing files. However, there is more and more talk in the entertainment industry about shutting down torrent sites/software and catching people who use those, as well.|`|ZWMWfcH0aa	no<br>  no ? no<br>  ?<br>  horrible no<br>  not<br>  get an iPod and it will be a lot easier|`|N4qQPcQGaa	Limewire is illegal.

AA12180617	DO NOT TRY IT!<br>  <br>  you have a 70% chance of bricking (killing the unit) and you gain nothing over the officail apple 2.2 Firmware availabel from itunes..<br>  <br>  on jailbreaking WHY?<br>  <br>  Cydia (and other jailbreaks) have cause more problems for people than its worth.. (I never jailbreak but buy apps like Air sharing to enable limited disk use) as the only other extra is unapproved apps and background wallpapers (which are distracting).<br>  <br>  NEVER JAILBREAK! It causes so many problems and yet adds nearly nothing!<br>  <br>  the 2.2 software from apple is stable and works well and lets you add hundreds of apps (many free) from the itunes App Store, many with features available in jailbroken items.<br>  <br>  Jail breaking became redundant when the 2.0 software was released as it add almost nothing to the ipods abilities (other than the ability to browse its file structure which also makes it less secure).<br>  <br>  Jail breaking also voids the warranty and does cause many issues form files vanishing, memory leaks and loss, rebooting and even failing to boot.<br>  <br>  Jailbroken ipods cause so many problems (just search on here for them).  It alters the boot code so its not really an ipod at all.|`|nVv55eW1aa	i have an ipod touch too and ive never even heard of it|`|uSA3XuaYaa	my brother jailbroke mine. i think it will let you put games and apps on it for free. not 100% sure though. i am not sure how you do it.

L1FUcmb0aa	Taken away, sure. There is not much of a need for phones in the classroom unless there is an emergency. If your parents called about something really important, I'm sure the teachers would understand. I don't think that the teacher should keep the phone overnight, however. During the class or until the end of school is long enough.|`|MdgLHHd3aa	I hate authority, but if you're using it during class, it's disrespectful toward the teacher.  The rule is that you do not use it during class.  I'm not trying to be an ***, but if it's really that important to you, then you won't use it during class because you know it will get taken away.<br>  <br>  Can't stand to lose the phone, don't use it during class.  I'm sure you can survive an hour without communication.<br>  <br>  just sayin'|`|5U1TTI7Taa	typically if you're under 18, a teacher can take your phone away if you're using it in school when it's not allowed and keep it until your parent picks it up.<br>  <br>  i don't see a problem with it personally, there's no reason to be using your phone in school. i get that you need it for emergencies and things like that, but you need to think about the pros and cons before you text message through class and get caught.|`|BpUTyfDxaa	Like everyone else said it is disrespectful and cell phones can be used to activate a bomb.

However, if you are not using it, it shouldn't be a problem for the teacher.|`|ZaSiPFvtaa	I agree that it's wrong, but I do it anyway, because I have to.  I'm a teacher.  If I don't enforce the cell phone rule, I'll get in trouble with the school administrators.  And it isn't their fault, either, because even if they or the school district administrators or the school board wanted to, they wouldn't be allowed to allow cell phone possession by students.  Why?  Because, in my state, such anti-cell-phone rules are required by state law.  It's the state legislature's fault.<br>  <br>  Government needs to do less.  It also needs to #@$% off.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Yes it is ok, if your playing with it in class or it rings in class it's interrupting the other kids who wants to learn.  It's not fair for the others in the class who is trying to hear the teacher.  A student playing with their cell phones in class has no respect for the other students in class as well as the teacher.  Now that's wrong!<br>  Solution, keep your phone on vibrate and in your pocket during class and you won't get it taken away.|`|AA12021966	If your phone is that important to you, don't use it during class. It's disrespectful to the teacher and your education is more important than anything you need that cell phone for.<br>  <br>  At my high school, if you got caught with it enough times, they'd take it away until the end of the school year. Stop complaining.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Virtually every school board has instituted rules allowing teachers and school officials to take away cell phones.  I have no problem with these rules especially given the widespread use of phones for cheating.

ssoZ33XIaa	It really depends on what particular player you have, as the format support varies widely from player to player.  I have a Sandisk Sansa e280, for example, which only supports AVI videos.  I would check any manuals that came with your player if you have them, or if that is not helpful, do a search online for your player, I'm sure somewhere it will list what video formats it supports.  A lot of players also come with converters so you can get the videos onto your player.  Did yours come with one?  I would check.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	It could be several things. My player only plays files with a file type of AMV. I have a converter program which came with my player which will take file types such as MPG, MP4, MOV and AVI and convert them to the AMV format. Check the software that came with your player. Read the manual...

qGfAlDd2aa	It's not really a converter.  It's a satellite receiver.  Satellites work in the microwave bands so you need a receiver that will work for those bands.  You wouldn't use an AM radio to watch TV would you?|`|s7Muujxzaa	No. To get Directv, you need a Directv receiver and a Directv receiver is not the same thing as a converter box.|`|DRiSewgTaa	if u have any type of cable you don't need a converter box

AA10280214	As long as you are not roaming off the Sprint network.   You can always call them to make sure. <br>  <br>  Roaming or off network coverage is the ability to make and receive calls, text message, or use data services while off the Nationwide Sprint Network or Sprint Mobile Broadband Network. Sprint has wireless roaming agreements with many carriers in the United States and internationally that provide extended coverage when you are off the Sprint network.<br>  <br>  Depending on the type of phone or device you have and the coverage area you are in, you will always have access to voice calls, and may be able to text message and use data services.<br>  Sprint has many rate plans where there are no additional charges for roaming.<br>  <br>  With other rate plans, you will accrue roaming charges when you use your wireless phone outside of your home service area. With these plans, when a call is made outside of your home service area, airtime and roaming charges for the call will appear on your bill.<br>  Where roaming is available, roaming charges and usage will appear on your monthly Sprint bill within 30 - 60 days.

aoyiPTmGaa	Well that would be a hard one cuz I have Orange box and its very fun and entertaining. Why dont you get one now and the other later. Well, if you ARE gonna do that, i suggest you first buy L4D. Unlike orange box there is a storymode online play(4 players). Yea, orange box has team fortress and I've played it, but I can easily say that L4D online is better after playing the demo. Plus, even when your ont playing online its still exciting. Especially when theres are horde of zombies and you jus shoot crazy in all directions. Although it may get a little scary it never gets low on the fun meter, nowuttamean?<br>   Orange Box is very interesting, even if you haven't played the first half life and dont kno the story. Portal's puzzles are fun & smart, though I found them a bit repetitive when I was stuck. Half life2,HL 2:E1,HL 2:E2 have pretty tricky puzzles also, though it didnt lessen my interest one bit. Also you can change the difficulty any moment in the game when times got tough.<br>    Both games are addictive. Those two SHOULD be in your list of games.

The cookie can only record video at 320 x 240 at a very slow 12fps.    Cookie is slimmer but Viewty is more feature-rich, as well as being a 3g handset for faster internet and video calling.

Viewty's better camera, more reliable but not as nice looking.  LG Cookies, easier to use, more FUN to use, and a good camera.  KP500(cookie) is cheaper i'd get the Cookie only for the price.
0AUTZt5Aaa	Warhawk is a multiplayer only game. No worries, if you have internet, a router and a cable running from your router to the PS3, then you can just sign up for PSN, which is free.|`|raEUval8aa	No. WarHawk is an online-only game.|`|sQdgzYKVaa	well if there is a single player mode on that game you can.  but you cant play online with people around the world|`|2DM7ruAjaa	Sadly is a Multiplayer only game  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en...

OujhXy2yaa	the first thing to try would be the cable connection, if the connection's ok you might want to try new cables, they're not very expensive, if that doesn't work I would just get a new player since it's probably the machine itself
TgBYy6HBaa	I just hit a yahoo answers search for "3 red lights flashing" and received 517 results.    But anyways, If you open the xbox and change anything inside you risk being banned from xbox live for life.  When they ban you they ban your gamertag, your xbox, your name, your credit card, whoever's name's on the credit card, and any address they can associate with your account, so if you have a brother, sister, parent, child, who plays on live in your house you could be getting them banned for life as well.    I don't know if fixing a melted solder is considered tampering with the hardware, but I know I sure as hell won't be messing with it.    Repair costs are around $100 if you're out of warantee, but if you're showing 3 flashing red lights (general equipment failure) then you have a pretty good chance of being covered.    Please unhook the xbox, have it in front of you, and call 1 800 4MY XBOX.  They will be able to give you the exact answer.|`|N20ihxVxaa	^^^ u will not get banned if u open the xbox......................    MS is ur best friend here.
7XYNveAraa	 I don't know what the Locust did to torture humans. Anyway the Locust are the main enemy and they're a cilvilation of species that came from underneath the planet called Sera. The Locust's leader i s the Locust Queen and they have plans to exterminate all Human life on Sera. On Emergence day this all happen, Locust of all types came out of these Emergence hole and killing all human life and taking prisioners. The COG soldiers fend off the Locust but the Locust are in mass, overwhelming numbers. The only way that they could slow down these Locust was a weapon that could kill the Locust which was the Hammer of Dawn. The Government of Sera told all survivors to retreat to Jacinto the last stronghold, , which is made out of granite so that Locust can't dig through for now.  The people who couldn't make died as well with the Locust.     Marcus Fenix is in the COG army but is put in jail for leaving his duties for rescuing his father. He is put in jail, but fourteen years later he is released and returns to duty because the mass of soldiers needed to defend Sera. He is taken to Delta Squad and their mission is to drop a Lightmass Bomb into the Locust tunnels to kill them. (The Lightmass Bomb is made out of Imulsion which is a type of energy similar to Nuclear power.) Once detonated most of the Locust are killed.    In Gears of War 2, The Locust rise up again and attack Jacinto the last stronghold of Humans. Delta Squad mission is to drop another Lightmass Bomb as a counter attack. But they are ambushed by Skorge a High Priest of the Locust. Some of the COG soldiers hold him back. Once in the tunnels the tunnels the Locust are having a civil war with Lambent Locust which are Locust that have mutanted by the Lightmass Bomb in GOW 1, The COG lose the bomb but turns the Brumak into a Lambent Locust, Once Marcus fenix kills the Lambent Brumak Locust by the Hammer of Dawn a hole is made and the COG soldiers escape. While the tunnels of Locust is flooding with water, killing the Locust. Supected GOW3      yeah i guess that may answered your questions    |`|7tYWqmZnaa	1. It doesn't say  2. The Locust are aliens and they were born aliens, duh.  3. It doesn't say

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?    The short answer is that it is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.    In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.  http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h... ...     The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.    http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5... ...  http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po... ...       For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)     There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.     There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.     CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select then click Stop and OK.     Lots of great camera tips in this link.   http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...     My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.      Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.  Once you select a camera, read all about it in the owner's manual.  You can view owners manuals at this link, but will need to Login. http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera ...     The source links show most of the cameras out there with prices and make digital cameras work better with help on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	I would choose the nikon.

Will it look bad?  Probably not TOO terribly bad as long as the TV is still in good working order.  However, know that the PS3 has very small print, even for standard definition.  Some of the print on games may look blurry and may be difficult to read.  Same with small icons and stuff.  But overall, you should be able to see enough of the game to still play it just fine.  Blu-ray movies will look no different than a regular DVD if you don't have high definition.      Go ahead and get one, but also plan on upgrading your TV eventually.|`|dxk9skFUaa	id get a tv first then the ps3 mate|`|BkfHgstRaa	I had a 14" tv just like yours when i bought my ps3 (back in '06)    but i upgraded my tv to a 32" mirai, which was around 500 euro (around  400 pounds) http://www.mirai.eu/Europe/ProductDetail...

vjYtboUeaa	you are better off getting a ps3 because...    - ps3 has a built-in blu-ray player    -ps3 supports 1.3 HDMI which has rich colors and xbox supports 1.2 HDMI    - ps3 has much more and better exclusives, most of them cant go to xbox 360 because it cant handle that many data(DVD- 8.5gb, blu-ray 50gb)    - because of the blu-ray's huge space, ps3 will have WAY better graphics than 360    - online is free for ps3 not like 360    - ps3 will have over 300 games released by this spring    - you can browse the internet on ps3, no such thing for xbox 360    - when developers get used to the system, the graphics will be WAY better than 360. should take them a year to get used to it    - developers stated that they will start using ps3 as the lead platform and port ps3 games to xbox    - playstation home, its a virtual community where you can hang out with friends and customize your own apartment which xbox doesnt have(FREE)    - ps3 is a true HD console. xbox 360 upscale games to 1080p and ps3 DISPLAY games up to 1080p     - built in Wi-Fi    - xbox 360: 33% hardware failure  ps3: .2% hardware failure(see the decimal? less than 1%!)    - ps3 has better back-comp except the 40gb     - rumble returns in spring 2008    - you can upgrade your harddrive without voiding warranties with any 2.5 HDD, which xbox cant because you have to buy a xbox HDD  (they actually have the step by step on how to upgrade it on playstation.com)    those are the ones that i know right off my mind but there are much more reason than this    Now I want you to do me a favor, list all the reasons why xbox is better than ps3. I PROMISE you that nobody will get at least 5 reasons    Prices as of today:  160gb ps3 $499.99(comes out in november)  ps3- 80gb: $499 with metal gear solid 4  80gb: $399 ( this is the 80gb core pack)  xbox 360(premium)- $299.99  (elite)- $399.99  if you want the accessories that ps3 comes with, that would add up to over 650 dollars, so that means ps3 is actually cheaper    Let's compare PS3 and XBOX 360:    1). A third of XBOX 360 (33%) are malfunctioning right from the start. PS3 return rate is only around 0.2%. Despite some people say, that new 360 has no breakdown issues - just visit Xbox section of Yahoo answers and see for yourself an amount of complaints.   2). PS3 has 8 (7+1) kernels in Cell processor, Xbox 360 -only 3.  3). PS3 uses advanced tech called Blu-Ray, one disc can store up to 54 gb (in the future - up to 200 gb), Xbox 360 - regular dual layer DVD-9 (8.5GB). It's possible to get HD-DVD (max. - 30GB) for 360, but it'll cost you around 180$, in this case Xbox is going to be MUCH more expensive, than PS3.   4). Calculations per sec - PS3 - 51-billion-dot-product-operati... per second  Xbox 360 - 33.6-billion-dot-product-opera... per second  5). PS3 has full media support - USBs, built-in 4 slots card reader (except 20GB and 40GB versions), ability to use printer and so on.  Xbox 360 has USBs and only 2 memory slots.  6). PS3 supports up to 7 Bluetooth Controllers  Xbox 360 - up to 4 Controllers  7). PS3 - wi-fi included (except 20 gb version)  Xbox 360 - wi-fi will cost you around 100 $  8). Graphics are stronger in PS3, due to RSX chip, that was developed by Nvidia exclusively for PS3. RSX runs on 550 Mhz. It's difficult to compare their graphics chips, because 360 has a video chip with totally different structure and operating memory is divided differently in both consoles. However, PS3 exclusives look better than 360's exclusives.  9). PS3 uses technology from AGEIA company. It does to physics of the game same thing GPU (videocard processor) does to graphics. This thing is on sale for PC(special card). The price is around 350$. There is no such thing in 360.  10). Xbox 360 is widely known for so-called "red ring of death" problem - it gets overheated easily. My PS3 was running for more than 15 hours non-stop with no problems. Sometimes Xbox 360 becomes so overheated, that thermopaste on CPU melts, drips on motherboard and successfully shortcircuits it. That's why in some countries people call Xbox 360 "Coffin 360".  11). Besides all of this, I've seen disassembled Xbox 360 - regular PC architecture - Billy Gates is an uninventive nerd (as usual).  When I saw disassembled PS3 - it was a surprise - smart architecture, good cooling (don't buy external PS3 coolers - they make everything worse - original system is good), etc.  12). In 2008 PS3 will get more than 300 games, including Metal Gear Solid 4, The Agent and other great exclusives. Here is the good link to the future PS3 releases. http://ps3.ign.com/index/release.html......   13). PS3 online is free, Xbox 360 - you have to pay.  14). There were reports, that 360 scratches discs. No reports on that in PS3.  15). The funniest thing, that right now there are no games for PS3, that show full potential of the console. Biggest games weigh only 25 GB (Xbox 360 will need more than 3 discs even for those).  16). On PS3 you can install other OS, such as Linux Ye|`|vnMJq8UYaa	Cant answer everything but xbox is better because of xbox live gold.

Xbox 360-(Pro's)Great Game Selection, Better Online(more Comfortable dashboard and Easy to use, But have to pay for online) And also Cheap! comes with a MIC and HD Cables    Xbox 360-(Con's)Noisy machine,(The New 360's have been fixed so shut up everyone about that!) Pay to go online, Not many games coming out except Fable 2 and gears of War 2..

PS3-(Con's)Not a good dashboard but is Improving but right now 360 beat them!, Not many games out right now, Not as many people online as 360, doesn't come with a MIC, Doesn't come with HD cables, Cost more.    But there is the facts!!! Is your Descion, they both are Great Consoles    Right Now i think the Xbox 360 is better but in the end, which means in like 2009 and later, I think the PS3 Will Prevail and beat out the Xbox 360 But right now the 360 online is better and has more games.|`|brZeaCWZaa	I am usually an xbox supporter but i just got the rrod for the 3rd f****** time and i have had a disc drive error twice.

They consider themselves pretty lucky to have found them, too.|`|ca1o8Ylsaa	yes  but if you don't play video games then no.But when black firday and near chrismas there very few of them.Last year you had to wait a hour outside in  the cold just for a wii.But if you wanted a xbox 360 ps3 you could easliy buy it.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	yes it was smart they will be in short suplly for the holiday season get   super smash bros, super mario galaxy, and mario kart|`|AA11706004	I saw a big stack of them in a Best Buy last week.

You could have saved money that way. |`|kf9tfTcTaa	For some reason RIGHT now people are walking into stores and buying wii's (They used to sell from christmas till June) So I dont know what's wrong, maybe so many people have them and the rest of the wii's left arent selling too good, but the wii is the best thing that happened to me for a long time....untill this christmas that is.

JnzKANg2aa	Los modelos buenos que yo nocozco son arriba de $1500, de verdad no sabrial cual recomendarte, pero porque no los checas por ti mism@, aqui en esta pagina viene el catalogo de moviles movistar http://www.movistar.com.mx/moviles/p_mov...   puedes elegir entre varios modelos, tu eliges las funciones que quieres que tengan, ya sea mp3 camra etc etc tu le seleccionas la opcion y te muestra que equipos tienen las caracteristicas que tu buscas.  En cuanto a la compa?ia de movistar, yo llevo 5 a?os con mi movistar y ya no me cambio a telcel y te voy a decir porque....  LO UNICO QUE ME GUSTA DE TELCEL ES SU RED, reconozco que tiene mas, a mi en lo personal no me ha fallado mi movistar, y hay ocaciones en las que agarra mas movistar que telcel en el df.  Te voy a decir los servicios que tiene movisar:  planes y tarias:  movistar cuenta con 3 tarifas de prepago:  Tus llamadas cortas se cobran por minuto, y si se alargan se cobran por llamada.  *Laprimera Movistar PagamenosTarifas por minuto y por llamada para consumos especficos, que se mantienen an estando de viaje (en Roaming nacional), permitindote cubrir tus necesidades de comunicacin y ahorrar an ms.  Movistar Pagamenos aplica sin importar el monto de la recarga.  Llamadas salientes a cualquier movistar y fijo Local  Las llamadas a nmeros fijos y movistar locales hasta por 2 minutos tendrn un costo de $2.75 el minuto. A partir del minuto 2:01, se cobrar $5.75 por cada 15.  Llamadas salientes a cualquier movistar y fijo Nacional  Las llamadas a nmeros fijos y movistar nacionales hasta por 2 minutos tendrn un costo de $2.75 el minuto. A partir del minuto 2:01, se cobrar $5.75 por cada 15.  Llamadas Internacionales (EUA, Canad y Puerto Rico)  Las llamadas internacionales a cualquier destino, hasta por 2 minutos, tendrn un costo de $5.50 por minuto.  A partir del minuto 2:01, se cobrar $11.50 por cada 15. minutos.  Llamadas a Celulares de Otras Compa?as  Locales $3.45 por minuto  Nacionales $6.00 por minuto  *La segunda opcion es Tarfa Unica:  Con movistar TODO Mxico es rea local. ?Paga la misma tarifa ests donde ests!  Con Tarifa nica el costo de tu llamada es de $3.45 el minuto sin importar si es Local, Nacional o Internacional y tienes el beneficio de comunicarte a los 10 nmeros a los que ms llamas, fijos y movistar, por tan slo $1.15 el minuto.   Adems ya no tienes que preocuparte si ests en Roaming, porque las llamadas que recibas de cualquier movistar o de telfonos fijos de tu ciudad de origen, no tendrn costo para ti.   *La tercera Movistar poe llamada:  No importa cunto hables, con movistar por Llamada pagas por llamada de 15 minutos!  Llama a nmeros fijos y movistar locales por tan slo $5.75 por llamada. Y por la misma tarifa, habla hasta 15 minutos de Larga Distancia a nmeros movistar de todo el pas.   Adems con movistar por Llamada todas tus llamadas de Larga Distancia Internacional (Estados Unidos, Canad y Puerto Rico) tienen un costo de $11.50 por cada 15 minutos o fraccin, sin cargos adicionales ni Roaming Nacional.

Si te cambias de telcel a movi te regalan 100 mensajes o 100 minutos o 10mb para navegar en internet.  No acabaria... entra a la pagina de movi y checalo  |`|65faff3b5310d69a961b3678a017ba90aa	mira pues te voy a decir he usado los dos telcel y movistar    Movistar tiene muy buenas promociones ose que casi no gastas pero tiene poca cobertura    Telcel tiene mucha cobertura pero tienen menos promociones que movistar|`|oUO9QdYWaa	Depende. Si eres un usuario que viaja constantemente, Telcel tiene mayor ventaja en cobertura PERO te cobra por el Roaming (6.59 x min llamada saliente, 4.89 x min en llamada entrante). Movistar no te cobra el roaming como tal, y te deja las promociones que tengas contratadas, cosa que Telcel no tiene.    La ventaja de Telcel es el amplio abanico de equipos que puedes comprar (incluso el iPhone y el Nokia N95, que ni por enterados estn en Movistar), la cobertura (??? incluso en el Metro de la Cd. de Mxico!!!), y la tecnologa 3G que te permite descargar contenidos a gran velocidad (claro que es muy caro).  En contraste, Movistar tiene mejores promociones, te regala tiempo aire en los Dias Movistar (recargas al DOBLE... incluso hace poco le ingres 50.00 y me dieron 100.00 ms), promociones aplicables en roaming, mayor amplitud en ASL (es decir, que si ests en Amecameca todava se considera que ests en tu localidad y por eso hay ms ventajas, cosa que en Telcel ya no aplica... es cuestin de distancias y ladas locales...), los paquetes de navegacin WAP (ms limitados pero mas econnicos que la Navegacin Amigo), entre otras ventajas.    Ya depende de lo que prefieras: costo vs. cobertura.    Y corrigiendo a YoMeRo, el nmero gratis para llamadas o mensajes tiene una vigencia de UN A?O a partir de que se da de alta por vez primera. Si tienes dudas comuncate al *264.    Ahora, equipos... Consulta la lista en la Tienda Movistar: http://www.decompras.com/webapp/commerce...    Igual y un Nokia 5200 de 1499.00 te puede convenir, pero mejor checa la pgina.|`|2f4760eda13c48f2052669c8de6d3681aa	Movistar es muy bueno, lo tengo hace cuatro a?os y es muy bueno, tiene muchas promociones que son muy buenas y rinden al bolsillo,  yo tengo un nokia 6131 con una memoria de 2 gb, muy buen sonido y buen producto.

My guess is that Facebook will have the problem resolved shortly, but in the mean time, you should send report a bug to the Facebook people so they know it's broken.

V6QCWVMoaa	A good strategy is to back into a corner with your three teammates surrounding you.  As the other team rushes you, your teammates allow themselves to be killed, while you jump overhead or slip through a gap somewhere.  Now, if it works right, the entire enemy team is chasing you and can't catch up, rather than blocking you.  Note that under no circumstances should a member of your team kill an opponent.  If he does, the enemy will spawn at their goal and be able to block it.  The whole point here is to get the enemy team behind you.    Granted this only works if the entire team rushes you at once, but when it does work, it's almost a garunteed score.|`|EvWLKiTgaa	dont play
ozQtZL8Daa	first of all don't buy the bose 321 systems, they are worthless for the price they make you pay.  I guess I am not clear on if you are talking about paying under $1500 for a tv and another under $1500 for sound or planning on using the 1500 for everything.  in your question you are talking mostly about sound stuff but then you throw in the 1080p resolution, which has absolutely nothing to do with your sound system.  It sounds like you are using the 1500 for just the sound system so let me help you out with that.  there are two ways that you can look at this, and it will depend on how you want your system to work.  I don't know if you were looking at the bose systems because of the fact that it only has two speakers which would mean less wires or what.  Personally piece together systems are a lot better system when you consider quality and accuracy of the sound.    here is a good example of a sound system that would be awesome for $1500    -$300 yamaha receiver - 5.1  -Klipsch B-2 bookshelf speakers - $300 per pair  -Klipsch surround speakers (i believe they are the S-1 or S-2 model)   -approx, $200 per pair  -Klipsch center channel approx. $200  -sony 12" subwoofer $200  (klipsch sub would be better, but I am trying to stick to your budget since the klipsch sub is $400 for their 10" size)  -100' spool of speaker wire $30 for offbrand, $60 for monster  -fiber optic cable to go from your ps3 to your receiver for sound $20 for off brand, $40 for monster  -subwoofer cable $15 for off brand, $30 for monster    probably just over $1300 after tax    Front projector:  For your picture if you are doing a  front projector, go with a DLP projector first of all, much better for your movies, smoother images, better color accuracy.  for your price you would have to go with optoma in order to get a 1080p front projector for $1500, and it would have to be on sale, probably.    Rear projection (LCD or DLP Rear projection)  Sony is all I have to say here, just get whatever 1080p size that you can squeeze into your budget  
BlATT8f6aa	www.Ventones  .com     the best one out there and FREE  They are Approved and Certified by most carriers,   to allow their customers to  make their own free ringtones, and   they text it straight to your phone.   And they format the ringtone specifically   for your  phone because they ask you for it right   after you sign up.     I know because I've used it for my 2 phones,   for the last 2 years, and I've gotten a bunch of my friends  on it as well

Do not buy an unlocked phone that is GSM, or has a SIM card, it will not work.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	Yes, as long as it is a phone Verizon services.  Verizon does not use sim cards like other providers.|`|c0ecfd9c0dc2333cceb9f6f88da9f142aa	Yes, provided it is Verizon compatible.
AA10326440	Tiffany is correct but she omitted one plan which is:    5000 text + unlimited in at $20 per month      Also, the $20 for unlimited texting to anyone on any network is for an individual plan.

LnSKQISDaa	Restore your ipod. DO NOT TAKE it the apple store they will not help you because you tryed to jailbreak there product.|`|9tau7wVDaa	I do not have an ipod touch but i have an ipod classic and the only thing that i can really recomend considering that i dont have an ipod touch, is that you take it back to the place that you bought it from and see if you can either get it fixed or return it... you could also try to contanct Apple Enterprises if you want.  HOPE I COULD HELP AND GOOD LUCK!!

FLJxghNjaa	I would suggest the Zune. It has a 30 GB storage cappacity, plays videos, music, movies, etc. It's the newest addition to the mp3 world. It retails for $229.97 at my local Wal-Mart.  If you don't need all that space go with the i-pod, it runs around $169.97|`|s8BAq20Yaa	There is a 2GB flash MP3 player for sale at www.catabox.com for $59.99. It is basically the same size and shape as an iPod Nano 1st generation. It will play videos, FM radio and is a voice recorder as well. Has worked great for me in my college classes. You can find out more about it at the website, especially the FAQ page. It also comes with a six-month warranty.
H3AeHv7maa	I had the same problem.  Quite a few nano's has been doing the same.    Press Menu and the Centre button at the same time for 30 secs and if that dont work it is finished.    You can get it repaired at an ipod unlock shop or get it repaired (if under warantee)    I Got a 60gb one for 67 at a Car Boot sale. so have a look there|`|9b6d20a0a5553b71e7c7b274df9d24b6aa	ahahaha that sucks (:    That actually happened to me last night.  I tried several times to shut it off and it wouldn't, so I just ended up letting it be till the battery died....    I recharged it this morning and it was fine.  maybe you want to give it a try?
dPFs4RQMaa	The iPod touch doesn't have the mail.app and the maps.app because Apple wants to sell more iPhones by creating an artificial differentiation between the products. However, people are already working on running those applications on the ipod touch:    http://mail.hacktheipodtouch.com/mail-ap...  http://google-maps.hacktheipodtouch.com/...|`|ClCHUjKUaa	well from an apple standpoint im guessing they didnt want to put that stuff in there because then it really is just an iphone minus the calling    but from apple insiders it is said that the operating system is exactly the same so you could eventually (in theory) have 3rd (or first i guess, but i highly doubt it) apps like maps and mail|`|AFD5bkUwaa	Well, for one, they want to differentiate the iPod touch and the iPhone so they're not almost identical.    For second, the iPod touch isn't connected to the internet all the time, making the mail app semi-useful, and to use Google Maps offline would require that you download all their maps onto the iPod touch which would require a LOT of space (more than it can hold).    But don't worry about it, someone will figure out a way to add both to the iPod touch. People already made a ton of applications for the iPhone, and the iPod touch is said to use the same operating system.

icvGxyvGaa	if you call your service provider they usually have a way to unlock it so you can set up your voicemail. Or it can be in your user manual somewhere at the beginning of the manual. Nothing to really worry about just give your service provider a call and ask them for the temp. password. Sometimes it's easy also, like 0000 or 1234.|`|b289dc765eb33b306975e807411a3c6aaa	it depends but usually if you call the voicemail from your phone it asks you to set up your voicemail and it tells you how. or call your service provider.
b289dc765eb33b306975e807411a3c6aaa	it just shows the number and when it was sent|`|Umkt1C1Laa	mine only shows the   of messages sent and received. No bill shows the actual message content|`|icvGxyvGaa	Depending on your service provider I guess. I have a txt messaging plan through Cingular/AT&T and whenever I get my bill it doesn't show me what the txts have said but it does show who sent/received which txts and the date and approx. a time as to when it was sent. Hope that helps.|`|QlgyOyVNaa	your bill only shows time/date, sent/recieved, and sender/reveicer . it will not show your text content.
hUEnwHNQaa	If your doing solid wiring into walls and stuff, HDMI monster cables will be the best choice. But if you can get behind your plasma and plug things in, a normal HDMI cable will do just fine The wii has its own set of component cables (a little less better quality than HDMI). I have the component cables for the wii and i am not really impressed with the picture. As for your dvd player, if it has an HDMI output, stick with getting an HDMI cable for it. But if it doesnt, than stick with component and buy a component cable for it. A site I have found that has really cheap cables it called Rite AV. They are a great source for what you need.  http://www.riteav.com/hdmifaq.php|`|3ZjFCDKGaa	HDMI cable depends on if your tv and your devices have the port in your case the satellite box, dvd player and dvr recorder since i dont know what brand you have i cant tell you if they have hdmi support but just look in the back of the device.  for the monster cables part they are just regular cables but way overpriced.  http://www.monoprice.com/home/index.asp|`|4MgHkVadaa	looks like you could do with a switch box or a receiver, are you using a speaker system?    Monster cables are ok, and they have started to do some top end cabling which has been getting some decent reviews in what home cinema and cinema choice     AS mentioned before its worth knowing what ports you've got etc...    also depends on what you enjoy doing... wtaching or playing or your 42"    If you like playing then connect that via HDMI    Sky via Composite    DVD player via SCART
0c83c39957343a2b934db46df7915948aa	I have it and text alot with no problem, the only drawback is you have to look at the screen when you text, it learns words you use so it helps alot but since there are no hard keys you can't text by feel.|`|EArGvsnraa	it's hard to text on.   get a phone with a built in keyboard, if you don't already have one. i find that they're the best.

I bought it when they went down,|`|TgBYy6HBaa	quote   I am think of getting one.  /quote    Game consoles are not sold for much profit, so retailers aren't going to have much wiggle room on the price.

TgBYy6HBaa	Microsoft takes a brutally hard stance against cheating... and unlocking acheivments by downloading someone else's game saves will get you banned for life (by address, name, credit card, etc).

9RvXOdRgaa	Don't worry, I've had the excact same problem for the last two days. It all because of the new updates, they have been to much for the LIVE server to handle so they have been making a few adjustments so that it is compatible with it. Oh and for anyone who wants to know, the new Dashboard interface is set to be released sometime in November 08'.|`|kwKVxMo2aa	yeah right now xbox live is glitchy, just give it a a few days or a week, the update is coming this fall so just wait.|`|asHYcG9Daa	It may be that since everyone is starting to get back online all at once since it was down it has gotten slow, but it should be back up to normal soon, and the new update will come later this season. |`|rvBBwdr2aa	It wont be right until the new dashboard comes out which has to be pushed now because they cant go back on the old servers so once they get us all set we will all be done.......... It has nothing to do with the overflow of people getting on live again that has nothing to do they need to get it out and xbox would be right and it wouldnt lag and log us out no more|`|HxmVx9Zlaa	Mine is working perfectly fine.  And yes, new dashboard in November|`|Puf6XhYaaa	wouldnt wory about it, usualy its because LOADS of players are online, or they are updating it or something. i dont actualy have an xbox so dont take dis answer 2 seriously.    or maybe u need faster internet connection who knows?    wait it out and see if its any better, good luck!    
m3mvn6QFaa	Not really anywhere specific that you could "trade" it, but you could try to see it on eBay or Craigslist maybe. There may also be some websites where you can "trade up" to something else, but I don't know what they'd offer. Any situation would depend on the specific model, condition, and included accessories.

cwxSshfGaa	T-mobile is awful!!!  They are tricky too.  Their plans appear cheaper than the rest but they are not.  The list of faults with t-mobile is too long to list.  They are terrible and the call quality is bad plus coverage is not good at all.    If you switch from Verizon to t-mobile you will notice a huge difference and regret it.  Verizon is the best and the call quality and signal is far superior to t-mobile AND at&t by far!    Don't switch!|`|5xm6pS2Saa	T-Mobile stinks. You get no service and Verizon phones are 10x better. Don't make the change! |`|T2BteYYvaa	I would stick with verizon. T-mobile has really bad reception and service, and their phone graphics look so horrible. I had T-mobile for about a year and I hated it. I switched to verizon about a 3 years ago and I am still with them. Their phones are well designed and the have the best reception and service. They have many more features and their phones are easier to figure out. Stay with verizon!

Peace.|`|afAqY1heaa	Well, when you are at the home screen, you press and hold any icon for 3 seconda and they start to wiggle. You can delete or move the applications. To delete them, you press the "X" on the left hand corner of the app. A pop-up comes up and asks if your sure you want to delete this app. Click delete and your all done.

ENsvvLcfaa	If I remember correctly, you need to run it with administrator privileges.    If you have a shortcut of War Rock on your desktop:  1.)Right click on it, then choose the "Properties" selection  2.)Go to the compatibility tab and check the box where it says "Run as Administrator".  3.) Click "Apply", and I think you should be good.    NOTE: This is if you have Vista.

AA11057445	Gamefly has some benefits.  They do have a cheaper monthly fee than renting in-store, or even signing up for in-store rental passes.  They have a huge selection.    But the turn around rate for returning games is ridiculous.  It takes me two to three weeks sometimes for them to receive a game, and then another week for me to receive my new one.  That's a game a month, sometimes, and I pay them fifteen bucks a month.. WAY more than it would cost me to rent in-store.      And about half the time, from what I've experienced, the game is scratched.  So you have to wait for them to send you another copy.  That takes forever.    In my opinion, the BEST way to try new games is to go to Blockbuster or another store that has a game pass.  They usually get the hottest games, you can pay anywhere from twenty-five to forty bucks and try the service for a month.  If the game doesn't work, or you just flat-out don't like it, take it back that same day and get something else.  It's better than waiting even two weeks for a new game to get to you if you're just trying stuff out.    So, Gamefly is a good price, but you get what you pay for, and the only reason I still have it is because my roommate pays for it and we just share the fun.  I wouldn't ever do it on my own because I've seen what he goes through.  Not worth it.|`|AA11674200	Personally I think it's even a bigger headache than it's worth renting games period.  I had a gamefly account till they deleted it.  They withdrew 20 bucks from my check card and were going to deduct an additional 20 something and was like, what the hell you just took 20 dollars from the card and now you're charging me an additional 20 something????  I smell a scam going on and glad they deleted my account.  I wrote them saying they can have the games I got out back once I get my refund of  the 20 dollars they owe me.
AA10423501	basically the same, the only issue youll get from the ps2 is the downloadable songs that will be available... i dont you can download songs from the ps2... though you can buy song packs...|`|pOi0wewIaa	It's pretty much the graphics |`|I5Yjtapqaa	the graphics are better on ps3 . There might be a few different songs on each of them.|`|1UkYbZxNaa	the graphis are better on the PS3. and on the PS3 you can customize your characters, im not sure if thats on the ps2. and then you can make your own songs, not sure if thats on the ps2 either. and then on the ps3 you can download more songs off of the Playstation Network, but you cant do that on the ps2. and the songs that come on the game are the same for the ps2 and ps3.
AA10423501	it stops blinking when its done charging...  |`|srKTP2isaa	Press the PS button (middle button), the upper right will show how many bars your charge has.
d904ae4bfe0897227c426013b23f6ac5aa	Yes, u need a third party program to extract the songs, videos and photos of the iPod. Check it out  http://www.iphoneandipodtouch.com|`|C2wtqAE3aa	Delete it from your iTunes Library, then sync your iPod

B17VheFgaa	you will need to get a new phone... The coolest thing you can do is to put it in mineral oil and show your friends that it turns on :).    But yep, there is nothing u can do.|`|gK7dP73Oaa	Go to an Alltel store with techs. They can reprogram it. Three years is not terribly old if it's been working fine as you say. I recently got a new phone from Alltel after 5 years. It is the Samsung Hue. It was free with a 2 year contract and I like it.|`|GAHanGd7aa	maybe just get a new sim card thats all i can think of
bx3Nq7lAaa	http://www.ventones.com    they allow you to upload and make your own ringtones for free,   In order to download other people's ringtones,   i read of these steps from another person, and it will work  If you follow these steps, you will be able to send any of their millions  of ringtones      (step 1)     login to your account on ventones      (step 2)    go to your My Ventones page and click on any ringtone that you have  already made in the past. that will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"  and that page will have a send to phone button. Don't click on it though!    if you have not made any ringtones in the past, go to the Ventones home page and click on the Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    (step3)       Next open Ventones in a new window. Find the ringtone you want   (from their free ringtone page)  and click on it. that will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will not have a send to phone button    (step 4)    Now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and select the option that you want. In other words, go through the process   of sending and clicking on the send to phone button.    You can either download the ringtone or decide to have it sent (texted) to your phone.   It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd window
O0D9GtElaa	It is most commenly for the iPhone, but what it is basically is making the phone usable on other networks.  Such as if you have verizon, but really want the iPhone you can buy the iPhone and not get the network with it then you "jailbreak" it so that you can use the phone with your network, verizon.
18K7ucsEaa	If you go onto the ATT website and log onto your account you can check your text messages. Even if you have unlimited it will still say "  of Unlimited used."      :-D
PixwhRR1aa	yes you will have to pay 35$,   they are greedy pplz, but rather get da g1  bcuz its da same rate but da g1's internet is way faster!
v2ut95Wzaa	i'm not sure because this hasnt happened to me but i would just leave it for a bit incase it has just frozen for a while - if it is still like that for a long time then you should ring up the place you got it or google it...|`|9EgXeA2waa	I have a Iphone touch so it might not be the same thing but try clicking sleep (off button) and turning it back on.. apart from that try google like sam said or i recomend itunes.. it has details or anywhere you bought it from it may need slightly reparing but to be honest i doubt it :)
Q2xibFGVaa	I have a 80gb zune and I love it.  Ipods are nice but the zune is bigger and the features are better-I think anyways.  Plus everybody has a ipod.  I like to be different.  Not only that, zune is made by microsoft which my zune is compatible with my xbox 360.
xQjToANXaa	visit the shop http://www.blueunplugged.com/c.aspx?c=54...  here wireless and datal gaming headsets  all are available.|`|	Any electronic store. you can but from the official Playstation store too. |`|	Official PS3 Wireless Bluetooth Headset     ( 3 customer ratings )     17.99 Free Delivery  RRP: 24.99 | You save: 7.00 (28%)    Pre-order. | Due for release on 28/11/2008    BUY  available at play .com ....My son uses headset from mobile phone ...a cheaper option really |`|	One option is to use a headset from a mobile phone. They work very well. Or, go to a computer store and buy one of their headsets. They are relatively shaped like stereo headphones, but where one speaker should be is a microphone.|`|	there isn't really an official but get one with a long cord not wireless because every time you want to use it it takes a while to hook up and is frustrating.  they arent very realiable.|`|	They should be in your local store.    |`|	It's bundled with SOCOM: Confrontation. SOCOM is a $40 game and the mic is $50. But instead of spending 50 extra bucks, buy the bundle. You won't regret it, Confrontation is the best online experience you can have on the PS3.|`|	at gamestop?
d1AuDRoFaa	i got it when they had this big opening for it in toronto,  and it was a really good phone.     i deffinitely think you should get it, the keys are nicely spread apart and easy to type on,|`|VfuCXCRAaa	NO its the worst phone I've ever had!  I got it back in may of 2007. So its not even a year old yet.  The keys work when they want to, and it shuts it self off in the middle of phone calls.      Its also very hard to hear on it, as well as horrible reception in the same places that my old phone had excellent reception with the same company!|`|2xveInVWaa	Just get it. A lot of people in the US have this phone and they love it.
1zhGMlbQaa	Odds are the pin is the last 4 digits of your phone number.  If that doesn't work than you'll have to call you cell phone provider and have them talk you through it.    Good Luck!
nfhrRt9zaa	if it is legal, yes|`|rvMxaNAraa	If its free legally, then yes. meaning if, for example, you download a free song from itunes then it is fine. Music from limewire is technically illegal. Or coping music is also illegal.|`|4J0XeLW6aa	it solely depends on your morals as free music isn't free :P i personally dont condone stealing, but free music is always good ;)|`|pW55qClKaa	In most cases it is illegal, and you sometimes put yourself at risk for a computer virus. So, no.|`|JaxggQoUaa	Yeah..duh :P    If you want to support your artist, I'm sure they have a donation page somewhere. Otherwise I don't like wasting my money to support the RIAA so they can fund their high paying lawyers to sue every violators pants off.    ----  Be smart when downloading free music. If you're not computer savvy, the safest route to download music is through a site like "playlist.com"  This route will ensure you won't get caught and you won't be getting a virus.    1) Search for your song  2) After you've found your song, click on the "Visit site" link for that song.  3) It will take you to a new page- at the top, in green will be your download URL.    >>    3a) Rarely it will be a link to another webpage instead of to the .mp3, somewhere on that other webpage will be the link to the .mp3   // right click new web page//    // view source //    // CTRL + F -find ".mp3"  //    // get URL and download //   --------|`|gzngIhCCaa	Download away man (:    Who the hell cares.    Go download a crap load of music and find out what you like, then if you like the band or artist, buy their music on Itunes and such so you wont be morally screwed(:    It's also illegal but nobody really gets caught.   Unless your like a jackass and download tons of songs.    Record companies know that piracy happens so its not that bad.

Z7R86nqQaa	it must be mp4 format.  the quality of an mp4 on the computer may look worse but its usually excellent on the ipod.  If you have a .avi video and you want to convert it try videodora ipod convertor.  This app works great, it converts any format to an mp4 and you pick the size, format, audio quality, and video quality you would like.|`|p11sk9qhaa	No.. they don't support .avi. Convert it. The video quality will be fine. When you convert it, you'll still have the original avi file.
4J0XeLW6aa	you can put mp3, m4a, wma, and m4p format onto iTunes. so you're pretty much covered there. when you upload all your CDs onto iTunes, they get uploaded with m4a formatting, which means that they are compatible with iTunes, so no, you dont have to pay for what you already own. you just upload your CDs, and sync them to your ipod and your done!    Extra- the Zen can rival the iPod, not to be confused with the Zune. Zunes suck. people always have issues with them. see here: http://www.livedaily.com/blog/3107.html|`|aH3vvUfiaa	Yes, you can put regular mp3's and CD music on iPod. The Zune can rival the iPod.

What is "dued"? Do you mean "Dude"?  Why does your sentence not make sense?  Lets take it apart for a minute.  "Dude..; I'm really bored.. We had school today because it snowed" Ok one would assume you had school, but why would you have school if it snowed? To say we had school because it snowed, one would assume you had it ONLY because it snowed, other than you DIDN'T have school!! Understand?    And there is no 608 PM, it should be 6:08 PM.  Here, let me fix the entire question or rant which this seems to be anyway.    "Dude, I'm really bored.  It's 6:08 PM on January 28th 2009.  I want to know of a fun website.  Any fun ideas because I am a moron?"    I had to add the last part for you, because your question wouldn't be a question without it.
Uj1ROxELaa	i suggest not buying it from at&t  there are plenty of websites that sell you the iphone for a lot less money.  try: www.ebay.com  or  www.craigslist.com.  or even try to google search it.
VFOyzZJIaa	First you have to convince them you are mature enough to handle the responsibility of the phone. In other words, show them you aren't going to break it and beg for a new one. Don't get into any fights or into any trouble at school and prove you're a good boy (haha).     Next, prove to them you aren't into it JUST because your friends have one (even if you are). Tell them you need it for emergencies. Have you ever come home late and have them ask you "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!?" Say "If I had a cellphone you would probably know, but I was at (place), sorry I didn't call."    Lastly, never beg. You may have to wait it out a bit. I had to wait... I waited my time and got 4 cellphones in the first month. Then switched over to the iPhone 3G. Now I'm fly haha.|`|KnvAFzwZaa	just tell them why u need a cell phone.  r u intend to buy a expensive cell phone, or cheap one?|`|biRMB5miaa	i had this problem for a really long time. So this is what i did:  -you can show them the phone you want(most of the time when you order it online you get a discount!)  -you can tell them if your in any sports, after school clubs, or even if you go out a lot.  -if your friends have phones get their parents to talk to yours.   -also if you want tell them like if the phone is $50 you will pay for half of it. (i did this for my macbook you can earn money by : a dollar a point in basketball, cleaning, washing the windows, a dollar a window, or if you like play soccer $5dollars a goal or if you just play aggressive or really good, and you can wash a car, shovel snow, ect.  i hope i was help and good luck!!    (sorry for the long answer!(: oops.)|`|5BV8jb7aaa	If you're having to ask that, you don't need one.|`|0Ed6yF9vaa	well it should be pretty easy because its income tax season and they'd get their income tax soon.

Thats wat i did after the office got tired of me using their phone toooooo much:P..good luckkkkk.|`|tE3Xi8VKaa	uhmm how old are you?  if your old enough and responsible enough just ask your parents  and tell them that you will be a responsible person and you will need it in case of sme type of emergency. uhm tell them you will get good grades and just start doing chores around the house. thats how i got my cell phone|`|GjeFdpfbaa	My parents got my sister and I cell phones after my sister was attacked by a couple of girls in efforts to steal her bra......    So, have something like that happen and you're good to go.
6ec9c15e78a0d1c4abf71bfebcde7755aa	I would go with the Voyager, the touch interface is great and the flip QWERTY keyboard is good for slow texters. I have one myself and love it. It has a 2 mega pixel camera so it takes some great pictures. It also has a very good music player and plays very loud. The calling quality is also great, you can hear good and people can hear you good. With the Storm you have to buy a data package with it and thats $30 bucks a month..bummer..i don't really know much about the Omnia..and the Dare is also a good phone, but the touch keyboard is a little difficult to use at times in my opinion, although it does have a 3.2 mega pixel camera! I'd go with the Voyager!!|`|fG6c1mXHaa	I have the dare, the phone part is great. the camera takes really nice pictures and I have no prob. texting on it.

XclKJeHFaa	Well first you have to find out what company you want. If you are an avid texter maybe at&t, sprint, or tmobile. Now if your parents have a certain plan already then you can look at the plan they have and see if includes texting. at&t has a great plan and some pretty nice phones. they have the iphone but i wouldnt suggest that for a first phone. sprint has 2 qwerty keyboard phones called the rumor and rant. they look almost exactly the same and run pretty well. tmobile has a similiar phone to the rant and a really nice phone called the g1. its kinda not a good first phone either but if your really responsible that would be a nice phone. You also have to look at how much your willing to pay, or your parents, and look for phones in that price range. hope this helps                                          your teenage friend that has a cell phone|`|MSb3gi3Caa	what plan is your parents on?  if its sprint, then the lg lotus is very cool - i luv it!  you probely dont need unlimited, no more than 1000, but dont go too low cuz txts cost WAY too much if you go over, good luck|`|Bt3Hvh5Saa	with at&t u can get 200 a month for $5|`|5iQRqxkbaa	Verizon, and only get like 300 messages a month because 20 a day isn't every much and you'll save a lot of money. :)

I have 450 any time minutes which I don't use all of them but   The text is what I seem to use the most  . It's really worth it though to have Unlimited Text because otherwise it's .20 cents per text  incoming and outgoing I believe. That is insane if  there's 100 texts thats $ 20.00 right there.

AA12336121	Basically, Viacom wanted a 12% increase in money to allow Time Warner and Brighthouse to continue carrying about 20 channels, including Nick and MTV. Time Warner refused and started telling subscribers how to watch the shows online.    At the very last minute, Viacom and TWC & Brighthouse reached an agreement, the terms of which have not been made public. It's likely that viacom got an increase- nowhere near 12% though.    Details are in the article below.    Hope this helps!
5533b838d0e681af8a65936cf049420faa	Yes i had this problem with my phone.  When i was playing with my phone i accidentally changed the center address for text messages, thinking this was suppose to be my number i found out it is the routing center the text messages go through. i couldn't send any text messages period. check with you phone provider and verify the center address and make sure it hasn't been changed. It can be found in the settings for you messages under text message, if not here your provider can help you check. please feel free to email me if you have any more questions.    cowboy3561
Av8xeDcKaa	It's a new phone, so it's going to be a while before the 7510 will be offered for free. Take for example the Nokia 5310 - it's available for almost a year now and it's not free yet (although I'm pretty sure I saw it in a corp store for $20 with 2 year contract, but the Web site is $50).    The wi-fi is meant for T-Mobile HotSpot @Home service, where you make calls via T-Mo hotspots instead of using your minutes. Not sure if it'll give you Internet access though.

If your looking for some music it also has a great music player and can play very loud. Get the Voyager!|`|2xveInVWaa	I recommend the lg voyager|`|Zc9dG012aa	You should look into the Samsung Glyde.

K790a - Kept Freezing... good phone if it didn't break down... or the fact that brother totally KO-ed the phone  W580i - Sucks ***... Weakest piece of junk ever!  K850i - meh... average piece of technology  Z710i - dad using it since he broke the w580i, bought it off ebay for 30 bucks  Z750i - I'm using now until my next upgrade in less than a year.

9M8lEQDqaa	I'm not entirely sure, but I'm fairly certain that you won't be able to use Virgin Wireless Broadbrand to get online on the wii.

sUSfQ9AZaa	I, myself (personal opinion) would never buy anything refurbished. But, I guess if you can also purchase an extended warranty, then you should have nothing to worry about.    I also would not buy any flat panel, new or refurbished without an extended warranty. They tend to be very fragile and have numerous problems. Just look at all the people on yahoo answers that have problems with them. Myself, I bought a 3 year warranty for my 37" LCD  I figure as long as I am covered for 3 years, I should be good, because the prices in 3 years for a new one will be ridiculously low, or new technology will already be out.    Good luck, and welcome to the flat screen world!!    JUST DID SOME RESEARCH FOR YOU - I looked up refurbdepot on resellerratings.com, not very good at all, they have a lifetime rating of 3.3 out of 10 they have a lat 6 month rating of 7.25, I would stay away from that vendor no matter how good the deal sounds|`|18K7ucsEaa	Yeah, buying a refurb TV is the same as buying a slightly used one that has been taken good care of. The parts that went out are the ones that have been replaced, and they have been replaced with breand new ones... All panel TVs are going to need service within 5 years anyways. Refurb TV's have just already been worked on and the timer starts again..    :-D|`|vYBLSLWQaa	Now, that is a pretty good deal.  I would go with it, unless you suspect it's a scam.

lsYRmKvZaa	My friend just got a LG DARE, and he's obsessed with it :p  You can get on the internet, take pictures, record videos, use it as a calculator (which is what he does in geometry, haha) and a ton more.  Sometimes, the touch screen can be tricky, but only if you have big fingers. Sometimes when I'm texting on it I use the end of a pen (a closed one!) and it's super easy.  I recommend it :)|`|X2rUlXF8aa	The good:   The LG Dare has an intuitive touch-screen interface, an advanced 3.2-megapixel camera, a full HTML browser, EV-DO Rev. A, and plenty of other powerful features. It also has excellent call quality.     The bad:   The LG Dare's touch interface has a slight learning curve, and we weren't too pleased with the handwriting interface. Also, the Web browsing experience was quite disappointing.    The bottom line:   The LG Dare is an innovative and feature-rich handset with several surprises that sets it apart from other touch-screen phones.     Specifications:   Band / mode: CDMA2000 1X 1900/800 ; Talk time: Up to 280 min ; Combined with: With digital camera / digital player    hope this helped|`|vjJeHwtPaa	Im not sure about the exact model.

Couple that with the email features on a BB, and I think it's well worth it.

bx3Nq7lAaa	omg Ventones.com is the easiest and best and most free site you will find. Its the best .   This is what you can do    1) make your own ringtones from mp3 files or even youtube videos. Its the best. No otehr site has that    2) or if you want to download other people's ringtones, just do this      (step 1)     login to your account on ventones      (step 2)    go to your My Ventones page and click on any ringtone that you have  already made in the past. that will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"  and that page will have a send to phone button. Don't click on it though!    if you have not made any ringtones in the past, go to the Ventones home page and click on the Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    (step3)       Next open Ventones in a new window. Find the ringtone you want   (from their free ringtone page)  and click on it. that will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will not have a send to phone button    (step 4)    Now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and select the option that you want. In other words, go through the process   of sending and clicking on the send to phone button.    You can either download the ringtone or decide to have it sent (texted) to your phone.   It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd window        Can't get any more detailed than that, those are steps that I have learned from doing my research and reading other people's answers here on Yahoo answers

snqTm3gTaa	My Bf has had the same issue. If you have had the phone for less than one year, then the Warrenty is still good. T-Mobile has replaced his Rizr 3 times now. The Warranty starts over with each new phone.  One cost is the Shipping and Handling. Oh --- and you can only call 611 to report the phone not working... you cant do it at the store... (or at least not in Texas you cant)    When you call - - make sure you let them know its not just the Battery or charger... they will try to just replace that only. Tell them you cant txt or call correctly and you have the same issues constantly. Then they will be more likely to send a new one rather than just battery and charger...    Only bad thing is.. We just figured out they may be sending him refirbished Rizrs each time. That is why they have replaced it 3 times in 2 years.     Best bet is to take the new phone T-mobile can send you and upgrade to something other than motorola. (their charges suck) Trust me I have had 4 motorolas and boyfriend is on his 5th... Oh and make sure they are not UPGRADING YOU when they note the change of your phone.... if they do that then it will affect your upgrade date..       Good Luck!!!|`|9CKrP9Keaa	You have to call tech support or go to a T-Mo Store. They will check the phone and replace it if necessary.
4J0XeLW6aa	iTunes is for mostly all operating systems. you must run on an XP or Vista.     when you try to download itunes, you have to click "save" not "run"- after iTunes saves, then you can open the program.    i know real player is compatible with ipods, but it is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to use iTunes with an iPod- they're designed for each other.|`|5CM7O6Uraa	You should save itunes to a certain folder, or your desktop so u know where it is. Itunes is not only for mac, so dont worry.   When u do that, and itunes comes up, you can get music by searching in the itunes store, which comes with itunes, or u can go to the internet and download music and save it onto itunes.    Hope this helps!

You don't have to buy music, you can use it to access the music you already have on your computer.  You will have to add the music to the library on iTunes first, then sync the iPod.

ReGhCqgVaa	Why would you want to do that?    I'm sure they will catch on eventually|`|rvMxaNAraa	They might let you do it a few times but they have the right to refuse a return when ever they want to. regardless of the 90 day rule. I'll bet you read the hole list of rules and policy the right to refuse a return is there they wont list it really big on the wall because then no-one would buy their crap. You cant possible think that you are the first to come up with that idea? The store has seen it all and they have well aware of their rights and what they can do. Im sure they will catch on fast especially if you return to the same person. But, I don't think its illegal if they let you return it then what the hell. Keep in mind that itunes also keys itself to the device so if you are changing it then you will create issues for yourself.|`|68d84dPWaa	you could but it would not be smart.

GOOD LUCK! :D|`|LGEnH7Kbaa	Well, here's one option. I'm not positive it will work, but it helps with a lot of problems. Just plug the iPod into your computer, and then click on the iPod in iTunes. It has a button on your computer screen somewhere in your iPod settings that will say "Reset iPod Settings" or something to that effect. Then, just click it. You will have to put the songs on the iPod again, but the iPod will be reset and this could help. Hope this works!

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	2.1 systems are basically just beefed-up TV speakers.  They're not surround sound systems.  In my opinion, although they're better than just the TV, they're no comparison to surround systems.  And since most decent ones I've seen are $300 or so, it's not a wise investment when a decent 7.1 system is only $300 more.

I don't recommend purchasing one unless you want to turn it in on a warranty replacement four months from now. As far as the Chocolate, there is a good reason why its called a chocolate 3! the First two were garbage. As far as the Glyde, they all seem to need software updates. I have seen them call people without anyone touching the screen and just putting it a table. They are garbage as well. The Dare is  a little pricey, but the truth is I have yet to see one need to be replaced. Out of the phones you mentioned I would say the best performance record is with the LG Dare. The versa isn't as spectacular as they made it out to be and the removable keypad is kind of un practical for being sold with a fully touch screen capable phone. The Versa needs a software update as well, since the screen lags and its not perfected yet.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	I have the voyager and its so easy to use. the keyboard is perfect the buttons are nice and big and spread out perfectly. Get the voyager trust me you will love it.  if your going to get the env2 why not get the voyager its the same thing but you get a nice big screen and bigger phone which you can see stuff unlike the env2 where the external screen is so small. the touch is perfect its so smooth for me
zpmXGZsCaa	You could use a peak limiter to prevent damage to your speakers.  Peak limiters are used in live pro audio set-ups to keep the large PA speakers from being damaged.  They are also used in recording to limit transient peaks on sources with wide dynamic range.      Unfortunately, peak limiters are all made by pro audio companies, so they're not cheap.  Still, you may find a good used one on eBay for a reasonable price.      Here's  a link to one that Musician's Friend carries:   http://pro-audio.musiciansfriend.com/pro...
mjWi7zvoaa	The phone uses a microSD card, your two gb card should have worked just fine in your phone. I would double check how you put the chip into the phone.

Then you want yourself some big screws and lots of them. I would with a TV this size just full the bracket up with as many screws as practical. Better put in a few extra than to wake up one morning with it on the deck. <br>  <br>  All that remains is to say good luck....|`|s1awA1jhaa	Look at the instructions of the the booklet of the mount but if you did not get one yet, talk to a employee at a store like Future Shop or Best Buy.|`|UAYzLyN4aa	Get a wall mount that is rated for the weight of your TV.

k2wiYJAcaa	If you mean online as in ebay:  -You could get a lost or stolen phone, this could be prevented by asking for the Esn number.  -you also save alot of money, and can find cheaper phones even if they are used.      If you mean buying online as in from the actual cell phone provider:  -you get good prices  but you could end up seeing better ones a week later, and stock is often not that great.    If you buy from a retail outlet-  they charge their own fees on top of the retail price of the phone, which covers their commision. If you buy from a network store (for example there is a verizon outlet, and a Verizon Network Certified Store) If you buy frm a network store, they have the priveledge to cut deals and offer discounts that other "chain" retailers cannot(The chain retailers are often found in malls, you can find the actual network stores through the carriers website.|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Online  Pros: You can often find a lot of information very quickly    Cons: You may have to pay shipping, and often the phones are more expensive than in a store. You can't actually see the product live before you hit buy.    In A Store  Pros: You can see what you are buying, and sometimes test it. No shipping charges often can mean a lower price.    Cons: You can't find a lot of information quickly, such as model information. Your information is what you know, combined with what's on the cell phone box and what the person behind the counter knows.     I hate buying phones online. I was going to buy my current Verizon phone online, but the plan I wanted was $100 to buy the phone. In the store I found a phone I liked that I could use for my plan, and it was $20. I only needed a basic phone, so the savings were well worth it.     To be honest, had I not gone into the store on a whim, I'd be an AT&T customer right now. Plus Walmart, scary enough, had a good selection of phones.|`|AA10794304	retail:  pros:  u no exactly what ur getting  warranty  u can test the phone  get ur questions answered  have the phone with u that day  u can return it    cons:  it may be more expensive      online:  pros:  cheaper  more variety    cons:  u may get something u didnt want  may be no warranty  cant return(ex.ebay)
wDJbbb2Iaa	they are for two different carriers. so pick the carrier you have.  turn on your brain|`|kq16rIGNaa	Storm freezes and it seems to have some bugs. i would really go for the g1 you can compare prices and its really similar to the iphone. and plus you have real web browsing with the g1. the g1 is verry nice plus it has touch screen keyboard or a keyboard that slides up. i would go for the g1 its verry nice and fun. good luck|`|kQg3HBSPaa	The Storm does not freeze up. People don't realize that the BB Storm unlike pervious BB models allow you to have as many applications open at the same as you wish thus slowing your processing speed down.. Just need to learn how to properly close applications is all.    The Storm does allow you to set costume away messages on IM.     Email and messaging on the Storm is untouchable. It is a Blackberry after all. One thing I would say though is if you really don't need a smartphone and you're just getting one for eye candy the Storm would be a waste of money. No point in getting a smartphone if you really don't need all the applications and versatility it offers while on the go or away from your desk.
JivLAZH6aa	keep it lying flat on the groung, do not stand it up.|`|znLzOCHlaa	Dont keep it in a cabinet where the heat cant escape. Keep it out in the open like on the top of the desk or cabinets so it is out in the open air. That is the reason the Xbox 360 gets the RRoD, cuz the heat cant escape. Lay it down horizontally, and DO NOT move your xbox when the disc is spinning inside, even the slightest movement will brutally scratch the disk, and make it unplayable.<br>  <br>  Also, if you dont think you are getting Xbox Live, you NEED TO GET IT. Honestly, you shouldnt even have an Xbxo 360 if you do not have Live.

Make sure you show hidden files, because the files will be hidden. Their names may be weird numbers, but they all retain their song information, so that once they are imported again, they will show the album art, song info, etc.    However, if you want to do it temporarily, you will want to follow the instructions here (this will allow you to sync your iPod in multiple places):    http://www.andrewgrant.org/2008/03/30/ho...

Go to the Genius Bar and tell them the incident. If it did brake and you have insurance, they give you another iPod, the same model for free.

OosO8xxcaa	Hey- Sorry to say, you are going to be out of luck. If someone lost the phone, they probably called to the service provider and reported lost. Even if you were able to get the 4-digit lock code off, the ESN (serial number) to the phone isn't clear to be released.     In this case, the Samsung Instinct (M800), you wouldn't be able to use it. You might want to try calling your service carrier and ask them to check the status of the ESN number, the original owner might not have reported lost. If they tell you it's NOT reported lost or stolen, you got yourself a great phone. On regards of the 4-digit lock code, try taking it to a Sprint store and see if they can master reset the phone. Goodluck! Hope this helps!

chKSL0Ewaa	Alright... so from what I read, i'm assuming you had already restored it... Plug your iPod in, and if a pop up automatically pops up asking if you would like to upgrade you ipod to the 2.0 firmware, then click Yes.  If this doesn't happen, you are more likely to think that you have to repurchase it. Don't do that, because iTunes sends receipts to you mailing account (hotmail, g-mail, whatever you have) saying that you have already purchased it (takes about 1 or 2 weeks time to get the receipt) ... if you for some reason never get it, contact iTunes explaining your problem and that you had previously bought the software, and they will 90% let you redownload it free.|`|RppnD2Fuaa	yea i think you will have to buy it again.

dqzoEw67aa	Look at the back of your tv where you plugged the xbox in, did you use component (red/green/blue)?  If yes, there should be red/white audio inputs right next to that input.  Plug a set of red/white audio cables from the xbox to the tv in that input.  Then change the tvs "source" to component 1, or whichever it is.  It should work.  And be sure you set your xbox to output audio correctly.

C7rV71Cjaa	Reason's Wii is better than the 360<br>  <br>  Motion Controls- The Wii took a different approach on how to play video games than the standard controller such as the Xbox 360. The motion controls add a new sense of fun and excitement to a game much more than some control pad. And just because you can use motion controls doesn't mean you have to have motion controls. The Wii has also proven that, motion controls or not, any game can be great.<br>  <br>  Different aim at consumer groups- The Wii is a video game console like the 360. Though the big difference is that the Wii offers itself not only to gamers but to non gamers and casual players. You can easily see this with the bundles Wii Sports game where it seems any person of any age can play. Old people, young people, people with disabilities or any other thing the Wii is more easily accessible to. I wanna see how easy it for a person with one hand try to play with a 360 controller opposed to the Wii Remote<br>  <br>  Games for anyone- You can find all different kinds of genre's of games on the Wii. Adventure, Sports, Action, Shooters, Life Simulation, RPGs, Horror, and others on it. The 360 is mainly for shooter games like Halo and Gears of War. I am not saying those are the only games on it there are more like Fable 2, Forza Mortasport, Viva Pinata and others but the games that make the 360 fanboys go wild are shooters. The Wii is labeled as a child console but I don't find video games like No More Heroes, Madworld, The House of the Dead and Fatal Frame childish. <br>  <br>  The Wii has more consoles than what you see at first- You have access to games from past video game generations such as the NES, SNES, N64, Sega Genesis, Sega Saturn, TurboGrafx 16 and a few more so at a low fee for each game you can relive the golden moments of video games from the past like Super Mario Bros, Super Metroid, Star Fox 64, Sonic the Hedgehog 2. It is just unbeliveable. All this from the Wii's Virtual Console.<br>  <br>  Proves that games are why you buy a video game console- The 360 boasts DVD, CD, mp3 playback, high resolution graphics, and great online play. Well the Wii doesn't play DVD's CDs, can't play mp3's, can do Hi Def and its online play is decent at the most. But most people already have a DVD player which can usually play CD's and a computer which can do those three things already. Hi Def graphics don't mean anything if the game is horrible at everything else. And 50 dollars for online play is mad seeing as the Wii and PS3 offer online for free. 50 dollars can get you a AAA title for the Wii. The Wii was made for gaming, not for what your computer can do already. Also half the games on the 360 are also on the PC, just something to think about.<br>  <br>  I gave 5 big reasons the Wii has an edge over the 360. Am I suggesting the 360 is bad? Not at all in fact I enjoy playing a 360 as much as the next guy. But with extra fees for online(you have to buy a $100 adapter if your internet connection is wireless plus the $50 fee for Xbox Live), high rate of hardware failure(The Red Rings of Death is all that need to be said), and focus on multimedia purposes instead of actual gaming, the Wii is just better overall. I could get further into the topic but I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get some biased 360 fanboys on my tail who are going to thumbs me down before even reading my reasons.|`|PbhC7eonaa	the xbox 360 has awesome grahics,wide selection of games, and xbox live. although the wii isnt that great with graphics it has motion sensitive remote,wii fit, some good games and is awesome when you have other people playing with you.another good thing is that the wii is the cheapest console and the most easily to learn controls. bit since the kids are in 4th i suggest you head more towards the wii since most xbox 360 games are rated T or MA. the wii only has several games with a rating higher then 10+|`|hwaTOBL7aa	The wii is better than the Xbox 360 because of the motion controls,it's cheaper to buy, free wifi connection, able to play gamecube games,able to use internet on it, the system has a very very small chance of breaking down, also able to get some exercise out of it. Wii is great fun.|`|15h9c8o1aa	since your a 4th grade teacher the wii is probably better and what they will like best. The x box is usually for more exprienced gamrs.

PIF4h7W6aa	I have Ghost Armored my iPhone, and iPod Touch 2nd Gen, and I love the stuff. I have not tried any other screen protector products, however, iPod Touches, and iPhones have screens that are very hard to scratch. If you manage to scratch your screen, it's probably because you dropped it or something, in which case a simple screen protector would not do much for you anyways.<br>  <br>  I just suggest buying a regular case to protect the back / sides, since that's more prone to be scratched.|`|iYPwLxr3aa	ya u should or it will be more breakable|`|8vzUHPJdaa	yeah because it probably get scratched a lot otherwise<br>  unless you're really careful<br>  you'll get used to the case|`|AA12116276	I don't use a cover. I would say it depends on what you plan to do with your iPod Touch. Still, I often find that I don't need a cover regardless of what I do. On the rare occasions I work out with it, I either zip it up tight in a pocket or put it in one of those pouches you can wrap around your waist. When I travel, I carry it in the box it came in while it's in my bag, and then when I want to listen to it while I'm on the go I just keep it in a secure pocket like I mentioned before. No scratches, no breaks, no drops yet. And no money spent on an annoying cover.

When i was a kid Nintendo Was awsome!|`|78b5703437578d17b98b61d3eb944356aa	well, the ps3 would be something you wouldnt be able to get without getting mugged, cause my cousin waited in line for them untill like eight, and he almost didnt get them. I would have to say, a playstation portable, because she could get the movies, music, and video games all in one. Good Luck!|`|81315015cad7dcff3ace8d43b6ad76a8aa	The Wii is the best choice. PS3 is too expensive for the casual gamer and the Wii is a lot of fun and it doesn't take long to learn the controls. While the Wii does not have "Naruto" I guarantee that she will find many fun games for the Wii. The DS Lite would be good if your daughter travels a lot because its portable.|`|864f7f165657ed832478ac237e4d1b57aa	13 years= PS3. your daugter will love u for it. I am 13. I wish my parents were like that|`|AA10026456	well if you were planning to buy the PS3...    you might as well buy your daughter a wii and a DS lite, cuz it'll still be cheaper... than one PS3     also, it'll probably be easier to find,    and nintendo is more intended for all ages, especially young females.     and the DS and Wii interact with each other,   the Wii is backwards compatible, with the gamecube, controllers and games,    and the DS is backwards compatible with gameboy games and such....    they're both Wifi capable and are amazing ^_^     and the DS lite, (which is perferred over the original DS) comes in pink     so there ya have it!     o and nintendo games are cheaper and more family based    fun stuff|`|bd7443132135fcff4ee39bfb6ca6787eaa	I believe you should get a Wii for her. Its not very complicated, which reports have said the PS3 is, and its much better in graphics, gameplay, and overall fun than the Ds lite. It also has Naruto and Bleach games coming. The wii is also much cheaper than the PS3.|`|AA12319215	Well, I have both.  It really depends on how old your daughter is and if you feel her current desires in games will remain the same for a few years.  The PS3 is really for avid gamers looking for an all-in-one system.  The PS3 has Blue Ray (Hi Def capabilities), WiFi connector (allowing you to access the Internet via your home router for on-line games), a card slot on the 60GB allowing you to access digital photos and videos and finally has AWESOME graphics and sound.  The Wii is designed for the younger crowd that enjoys interactive games (it comes with a motion sensor).  Nintendo is not trying to take gamers away from the PS3 (currently selling for over $1000 on EBay) or XBox, they are just trying to expand their current base demographics beyond just the kids and teens.  If your daughter is between 8-15 my suggestion would be to stick with the Wii.  So far as the DS Lite is concerned, my 12 year old got tired of hers in 2 weeks. Whatever you decide, just wait until after Thanksgiving, all the hype right now has over inflated the prices of these consoles.  Don't  get me wrong, I have another PS3 on EBay right now but if you can, save your cash and keep checking with Walmart or Target, the Wii's will be in soon.  Good Luck and happy Gaming!!|`|AA10034772	The PS3 tends to have more serious and mature-audience games.  Nintendo tends to have more general fun games with less gratutitous violence.  The DS lite can't really be compared because it is a handheld system.    It is fun, but the new controllers for the Wii are going to make it a fun, interactive, different experience.    I know Bleach will be on Wii, and most likely Naruto too, but not before Christmas.  Games based on Animes tend to find themselves on Nintendo consoles more often than Sony or Microsoft (XBOX) consoles.      I would say the Wii sounds like the best bet for her.  Also, if she isnt a hardcore gamer, the PS3 is really a bit overpriced if you don't care about slightly lower quality graphics...|`|a7c737107ac7ea44c24acc732437938baa	Do not buy a PS3 under any circumstances.  It costs $600, the controller has no rumble feature, the motion-sensing is nowhere near as good as the Nintendo Wii, the backward compatibility has a lot of problems (backward compatibility is broken for roughly 200 PS2 games), and the launch line-up is terrible.    Also, given that only 400,000 PlayStation 3's will ship to the US this Christmas season, your chances of actually getting one are slim to none.|`|98c97fa47960b8a936d7a57d831656c7aa	Hey, well i just purchased the wii at 9 o'clock this morning. This is the best system i have EVER played. Now, i'm 15, and i dont know how old your daughter is. but after playing excite truck and zelda i cant imagine her not liking it. In comparison to the ps3 and the ds lite, its amazing. I also slept out for the ps3 and i really didnt see much of a difference in the games than on the ps2 and i own an original ds and i dont find it amusing.  Now to be able to get your hands on one of them (the wii), you need to call your local walmart or target, the second  shipment for the wii should be within a week, but i would strongly suggest calling ahead because you dont want not get there with nothing there.   they will usually tell you when they are going to get them in and how many. I hope i helped you out,Ryan|`|b9041551fb3edf683eadaaad726f9479aa	wii or DS lite, which ever one is cheaper between those|`|AA10001300	People don't really read your question, do they?  If she wants "Naruto" and "Bleach" (Aww... no love for "One Piece"?!  One Piece is the best!!!!), then it's either DS, Wii or PS2 (TWO).  For DS, there's a Bleach in the Japanese market, it has internet play function so you can fight with other people online.  However, I don't have that game so I don't know if internet play works in the US.  Still, that game is extremely popular in Japan, even without internet play, it's a fun game! (It was developed by Treasure, famous for their 2D beat'em ups for the Sega systems.)  Check out the link to Bleach DS!!    PS2 and Gamecube has the "Smash Brothers" clone - Battle Stadium D.O.N.  (I think that's why it's called - D.O.N. stands for Dragon Ball, One Piece, Naruto.)  I have that game, it's a fun game with you have friends to play with.    Both Wii and PS3 are too new and don't have any of those anime based games out yet.  Sure, there's backward compatibility... so you can get the Wii and buy the Gamecube Naruto game, Battle Stadium DON, Bleach... that'll work too.  (PS3 has backward compatibility issues so don't get it for PS2 games.)    Also, PS3 is out of the equation coz it's too expensive and there won't be any stock until after Xmas.|`|fd835459f40e9d2f2a5c05a52646dfa2aa	Like others have said, for a young female who's interested in Naruto or Bleach, get a wii or a DS Lite.    You could get both for less than the ps3, and the wii is backwards compatible with the gamecube with has several naruto games out.    In addition, ds can come in pink, and both try to cater to the family audience as well as everyone else, so it's much more likely you'll find games you wouldn't mind your daughter playing on these systems as opposed to a ps3 that only really has shooting and sports games right now.    Plus, DS lites are really popular. Nintendo sold more ds lites last week than sony did ps3s.

Make a folder in your PSP folder (while on your computer) that says "MP_ROOT"    2. Make a folder in the "MP_ROOT" folder that says "100mnv01"    3. Drag the video files into this folder and then they are ready to view.    NOTE: Please make sure that the videos are in the format that the PSP can view. You can use a free program called PSP video 9 to convert the files.     I don't know why the hell they made it so damn confusing!
