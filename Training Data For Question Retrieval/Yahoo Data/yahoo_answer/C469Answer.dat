Here's a little something for burgeoning urban gardeners and those without green thumbs alike. We featured AeroGrow's aeroponics system back in the day, before it was available for sale; we're happy to say that it has finally arrived. With it comes your ability to grow vegetables, greens, herbs and the like in your kitchen (or just about anywhere indoors) by suspending plant roots in the air, rather than soil or water. The suspended plants derive their nutrients from the air; with the help of the "smart" lighting and nutrient-cycling that comes with the garden, the company claims accelerated growth and increased yields over hydroponics and traditional outdoor gardening. Skeptical? They even guarantee a harvest after 28 days. AeroGrow also offers seed kits to go with the garden, including things like chili peppers, gourmet herbs, cherry tomatoes and strawberries; the garden goes for $149.95 and the seed kits are $19.95, available through their website and selected retailers like Sur La Table. ::AeroGrow    Thirsty for more?

Lucito  March 14, 2006 3:54 PM |  flag a problem    Luc Paquin says:   Hydroponics and aeroponics are good for 'high value crops', herbs, bell peppers etc. that are worth the extra trouble. I can't imagine that this system couldn't take other seeds in it's pod system. You already have the hard part which is the nutrient circulator and timer. You could even make your own nutrient out of miracle grow and epsom salts, i did this in a hydroponics experiment for a while.     The sad thing is if it requires the proprietary seed pods, then this is another example of the current economic model companies seem to favor: make the initial equipment purchase as cheap as possible and rake in the profits on the consumables. Printers, pod coffee machines, cars, they all follow this now since people make their purchase decisions on the unit price, not the overall cost with the consumables.    It's especially egregious when the company tries to lock out competition for consumables through some legal means, see Lexmark's case against an aftermarket toner cartridge that infringed on 'intellectual property' via the DMCA. Or the recently decided case where US automakers have to release the engine diagnostics codes so that independent car shops can still fix american cars.    It's important to look at the overall cost and repairability. It's probably more expensive up front, but cheaper and more green in the long run.

I understand that unlike hydroponics, aeropoincs doesn't use a growth medium like rockwool to hold the root system, but I'd imagine that you'd need something to suspend a germinating seed. Given that you could get ahold of something like that, I imagine it wouldn't be too hard to fabricate your own pods.

You would need to hire someone with heavy construction equipment to do both.    I'd say you're looking at $800-1000 depending on how long the job lasts.

07a647b6a4d7e292eacb07b50a5536b1aa	It never fails to amaze me that manufacturers of showers continue making two seperate controls for showers.  I installed a one- control shower fitting which is infinitely variable from cold to hot, and furthermore , it has an anti-scald feature, which means that if it is turned on full ( anti-clockwise, in my case ) it is very hot , but never burns.  I have heard that in Scotland it is an offence to sell showers which don't have anti-scald features built in.!!!    I was doing some research and discovered that they use a capsule full of a special wax which is rapid acting when exposed to temperature rise. Something to do with coefficient of linear expansion.|`|bxlYleZkaa	no, my doo-dads are ok, thanks.|`|3arJsZ91aa	I spend most time trying to keep the shower head in the holder.  Mine broke, so I bought a thing called a 'Shuc' from ebay (saw it on Dragon's Den).  It is a movable shower head holder.  Suction cups to keep it stuck on the tiles (which regularly fall off - the suction cups, not the tiles!) and the head holder keeps drooping despite being constantly tightened.  I haven't yet found a replacement for the original holder, so am stuck with it for now.  Luckily it didn't cost much.  Can't complain to the company though as their website has been 'closed for maintenance' for quite a long time now!|`|LqaQ5f5Vaa	sounds like the washer may be a bit iffy, take it out and have a look.|`|AA12379904	Well i end up wrestling with my hoover cord.If that's any help.|`|edzU8VJiaa	Oh, yeah!  We have 5 showers in our house, all of which are either freezing or scalding unless you know exactly how to deal with them.  We have loads of visitors, and I have to instruct them each time; stand OUTSIDE the shower and turn the COLD/main shower control on FULL.  Then turn the HOT on a little.  Stick your hand in after a couple of minutes, and if neither too hot nor too cold, get into the shower and adjust slightly.  Get wet, have your shower, and be thankful you haven't been either scalded or frozen.    We have very modern shower controls which, unfortunately, are controlled by a boiler which, because of UK regulations, sends water to the showers at 60C - which is too hot.  Our old system allowed us to vary the temperature from cold to hot - a simple system which now, unfortunately, is illegal to install.    All you can do is try to turn your boiler hot water control down slightly; but our boiler engineer basically said "learn to live with being scalded or get legionnaire's disease" (not very helpful but now we know why any boiler system will not let the temp. drop below 60C - which to most of us is TOO HOT!)|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	My shower is a total disaster.    I have to let the water run on the hot setting for at least five minutes before it is anything but freezing cold. Then, I shiver in lukewarm water for a few minutes until all of a sudden a scalding hot gush of water comes out, and then I have to quick add cold and jump to the other side until it cools off again.    Then, I have to replace the shower head every six months or so, because my very hard water keeps clogging it, and slowing the water down to a trickle. Right now, it is taking me about five minutes just to rinse the conditioner out of my shoulder-length hair.

AA10051049	After doing the things that Jim suggested it still won't start, I would put a teaspoon of gas in the sparkplug hole, replace the plug and try to start it.  If it starts and runs for a bit it is likely a fuel issue.  Make sure that the gas flows freely to the carburetor.  If it does the carburetor needs cleaning.  You can do it yourself or have it done.  If you do it yourself you will need a good carb cleaner, not the spray type, to soak the parts in.  Make sure all the passages are clean, blow it out with compressed air and put it together with a rebuild kit.  You can also start by removing the float bowl from the carburetor.  It's internal condition will tell you alot about the rest of the carburetor.  If it is dirty or there is white crusty "growth in it, the carburetor will probably need to be cleaned.  If its clean you may get by with just unsticking the float needle valve.  Note, water in a gas tank looks like "blobs" on the bottom of the tank.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Clean the plugs, carburetor, gas cap vent, and put fresh gas in the tank. Be certain the fuel line is clean and you have spark. Also lube the linkage on the throttle.  If it still fails to start, take it to a small engine repair shop.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Probably just old gas.  Drain it and try with fresh fuel.  (You can keep the old stuff and mix it with fresh fuel to use it.)|`|EdimolPfaa	These are really hard to pull start. I have used starting fluid on mine.

Temperatures below about 5?C (40?F) can kill the plant. The plant needs light but filtered sunlight through a window is usually sufficient. When the plant is brought home from the nursery, it will likely need repotting. The plant needs moderately moist soil. The soil should be fertilized with either regular liquid fertilizing or fertilizer pellets or spikes. Leaves will periodically roll up and fall off to make way for new leaves. Yellowing of the leaves is generally a sign of problematic conditions, such as a nutrient deficiency in the soil.They also respond well to hot and dry temperatures."  - wikipedia    if it is because of the weather  *water it with warm water  *bring it indoors  *add some fertilizer  *hope for the best    good luck!

AA10300801	What kind of worms are you talking about?  Earthworms?  And eggs?  Has this plant always been an indoor plant?    Either way, you need to re-pot your plant and wash away the eggs.  Get rid of the soil you are currently growing it in.  You should re-pot it in fresh potting mix, not soil from outside.  Potting mix is sterile: there shouldn't be anything living in the soil of a houseplant.    It would help to know what the eggs looked like, but in any event, wash them all off with warm, soapy water.  I would add a systemic insecticide to the freshly re-potted plant to give it a defense against any insects that may have escaped your detection.  Marathon works great: it is just a fine, granulated substance you sprinkle on top of the potting mix.  When you water, the chemical gets taken up into the plant and kills any insects that try to eat it.    Check the plant again regularly for insects and eggs.  If you see more, wash the plant again.  There are also some great insecticidal sprays you can use if you can place the plant outside for a while until the chemical dries (I am not sure of your climate).  I like the ones with neem as the active ingredient because they can be used for lots of different things.|`|WcudvcLxaa	i've heard salt helps|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	OK - worms will only be in soil you have taklen from the garden.  Put it back there - your indoor plants need clean compost not any old stuff from the garden.  Eggs under the leaves?  Clean them off - they are 99% sure not to be beneficial - especially on indoor plants.  Use a damp piece of cotton wool & just wipe them off.  Afraid I have no idea what a Vicroria plant is so I can't tell if it has tiny leaves or big waxy ones!|`|AA11498082	"eggs underneath" are butterfly/moth eggs that will hatch into Caterpillars and eat your plants.

omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "reflecting pool" (  6486) might be a good choice for the wall color, and then use "casa blanca" (  7571) for the ceiling & closet.    You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:  http://www.roomvues.com/  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|FXnHE7mmaa	How about a pale yellow or pale goldy yellow with cream or off white for your ceiling and trim...the horse pictures would look great with this and really pop...the dark wood furniture would stand out nicely

wgC9LQPHaa	I think they are both nice. The first one seems a little like a set for a younger girl (the butterflies give me that feeling), the second one seems a little something for someone older.

Y9GnCPm0aa	Forget the search engine, don't do this online.  This is a job for...THE FLEA MARKET!!!  Yard sales too, except that his time of year, there are none.  But you should be able to find an indoor flea market.  In fact, forget the earlier comment, try to search online for one in your area.  You might find some funky beaded cushions to go with that theme too.

8apA3Rffaa	Standard 2 nd floors will easily carry the weight ,  The weight is spread out evenly  The weight of a single person in a spot  puts more pressure down than all the cement board and tile will.   Latex thin set and grout is considered " flexible" but not to where your going to notice it. "Flexible" adhesives is a misconception.. Properly installed cement board and tile will last a long time..Any questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and also check my qualifications there.  GL|`|AA10097817	Check with your local code office. The inspectors should be able to give you an idea. Or, you could get an architect to check it out.

8apA3Rffaa	If your vinyl is atop the concrete too, which I guessing it flows right thru and its the vinyl hiegth your  concerned about.. There a couple ways to go about it... You can do a 1/4 x 1/4 square notched trowel on the floor and back butter the tile and see how that matches up. Or do the proper 3/8 x 1/4 notched trowel w/ a v notched trowel to back butter the tile and see how that matches in hiegth..Its hard to say since I don t know what trowel size they used . If you vinyl is down tight and it was done properly it will hold.  Any other questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there. GL|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	The best way is to lay a thicker layer of thin-set to lay the tiles in and let the tiles dry in a thicker bed of thin-set so they will be level.  You should only be talking about 1/8 " or so.  The best thing to do is use a trowel with larger notches (1/2" perhaps).  Now because it is only 1/8 " you do not need to lay the entire floor in a thicker bed of thin-set just the first row or two that are contiguous with the old tile.    To be truthful with you I am surprised you do not have problems with the old tile.  I would expect the grout to crack sooner rather than later.  But for your sake i hope it stays fine for years to come.    If it is 1/4" or more in height difference then you should consider putting down a cement board underlayment and feather it in.
5EQHRkbHaa	I doubt it, it could be the speed module or the motor I would think but depends what make?? Could be a bad solder joint on module, could be a faulty motor, it could be a disc in the timer or contact. I would start with module look for burn marks round a bad joint then go from there.

AA11305474	Once apply it, you can spray it with white vinegar after every shower and that will keep it clean.  If it is already dirty, clean it with bleach first then start spraying each shower to maintain it.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Remove the plug wire from the old unit and re-install it on the new one.  This is standard installation procedure.  Plug it into the same position on the outlet as you unplugged it from as that is most likely the designated line for the washer.  The other one should be for the garbage disposal.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Install a plug that is appropriate for the wire size to the dryer. It will probably be a heavy duty 3-prong plug. White wire to silver screw-black wire to brass screw and green(ground) to green screw.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	Most likely, there won't be enough clearance to use the plug.    However, using BX (armour cable)  just junction a new wire from the old box to the dishwasher.  You will have to remove the old outlet, cut the wall to insert the wire, but it is hidden from view, and be sure to install a cover plate on the junction box.     I would imagine this is a dedicated dishwasher circuit ?|`|BIwZ7klfaa	you can put a 120V plug on it, no problem, just make sure you put the wires in the correct spots|`|AA10257357	You should hard wire it into your new dishwasher.  You should never have a plug or an outlet like that under the dishwasher, it is code.  Because of the possibility of a water leak under the dishwasher, if you have an outlet or plug down there you will get the shock of your life.  Hard wire it and do it right please..
Xw7vmK3laa	Did you use the spool cap?
AA10103681	It would be OK, unless the neighbors are really creepy.  It could be Stepford Lite.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	It'll be quiet, at least there won't be much traffic. Assuming your neighbours aren't nuts, your kids should be able to wander where they like and your kids are very unlikely to get hit by a car. Honestly, I don't see any particular advantage or disadvantage here  when it comes to raising children. They get their idea of how to interact with people from their family, not from others. They'll have friends from school, and maybe you'll just have to arrange social occasions for them from time to time. We seem to be obsessed with "proper socialization"  for kids these days. Do you suppose that people who grow up on farms with no near neighbours never learn how to get along wth people?  I spent all my summers as a child at a cottage where we could do what we liked all day long.  I don't remember ever being bored, and when we were in the city at other times of the year, it was back in the days when kids were told to play outside and come home for dinner, or when the streetlights came on.  I'm so grateful for that. There is nothing better for a kid's imagination than having free time. Kids these days are supervised far too much.|`|AA10097817	My kids loved growing up in a development where there were kids all over. Actually, so did I.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Pros:    no traffic   children know every one that belongs there.  neighbors are more willing to help, with such few homes on the street  you can have a block party    cons:  you may[ depending on where your located]   pay for snow removal.|`|ee6M6L2waa	I dunno if it was private, But I lived in the country like that. 2 of my best friends lived there, well 1 lived in texas actually but another was my sister's age|`|FXnHE7mmaa	I think this would be great for you and your kids. They can wander and explore the area (woods and creeks) and you do not have to worry because you will know your neighbours. We lived out in the middle of 200 acres and it was the best thing for our kids. They loved it and so did we. We saw lots of wild life and they learned lots of things about nature. Being a private road you will have to share the cost of snow removal and taking care of the road, but will be well worth it. Keeping them away from city influences is great...I just think it is good for the family and you tend to spend more time together. Go for it.|`|KwipSpZbaa	well... could be cool. no noise etc, but there maybe fees to look at for resurfacing private roads and general repairs that are not covered by the state. Also if its quite lonely, you want to make sure about security... not a lot of people all about the place and stuff and might be good for opportinistic thieves.     However, dont worry about kids and isolation. Kids amuse themselves or you will run them around to other peoples houses... just because you live somewhere where there are a lot of families and kids, doesnt mean that all the kids are gonna get on, and you might find a houseful of 10 kids in your back yard, or worse - house!!!  Even worse, your kids hating other kids and perpetual moanign about "I hate so and so because he/she did this etc" or you might get "i love shelly and robert and claudia etc" but depends what you like. My son likes living on a road where there were no other kids and he likes living on this development where there are lots... they like it, you'll like it!  Life is what YOU make it... not the neighbours. Sometimes neighbours can be a pain, and it all gets a bit cliquey... but other times its nice to have people to drop in one for a coffee and watch the kids...     I like the quiet, my husband likes bustle, we have done both and to be honest they both have their down sides... but they also have their plus' too. Pushed to choose, I would go for quiet.... you can always find noise and freinds if you want them... not so easy to get rid of if you want quiet though!! :o)  The question really should be do you like quiet, or do you need to be surrounded by people and things going on. Mostly your kids will like what you like when they are young... and if they are young then they will get used to it whatever... think about some kids growing up as only kids, homeschooled in the Australian Outback! They all grow up fine hey!!    cheers  Claire
UQWusO1waa	you are absolutly right ! I will take less hot mixed with the cold to get same temp to shower in. I`ll be over later, hehehe  EDIT >>>>>>>>>>>those guys above me are CLUELESS.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	I have my hot water heater to the highest setting because I like rinsing my dishes in the dishwasher with the hottest available. It also lets me take a longer shower. I don't have kids in  the house so no one gets scalded.|`|LqaQ5f5Vaa	the answer to this is no, all you will do is shorten its lifespan, 65c is normal hot water temp|`|PTP8ptDbaa	no because it will evaporate faster!|`|qJxXS6luaa	I am not sure what a couple of the people on here answering your question are thinking, however.. . . . .  If you turn up the thermostat on your hot water heater this will raise the temp of the water inside the heater. This water DOES NOT evaporate in the tank. The Temperature of the water being delivered to the faucet will be hotter and doing this may also degrease the recovery time of your water heater. The misconception of this is that it will use more energy. Actually, an across the board average will yield the same energy consumption in a one month period of time. Use the dial on your heater as a guide in terms of safe operating Temperature. Water temps. above 120 F can cause serious burns. This is common sense, but wanted to be complete in my answer to avoid any liability.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Yes, for a shower you will use less hot water volume for   the same 'mix' temperature.  You will experience higher heat loss at the heater, and your   energy bill will increase. (You might want to 'blanket' the heater.)  The reason most heaters are set below 120 F. is to minimize   the danger of scalding with the hot water supplied.  If you have kids in the house this is a real concern.

10YksH8caa	yes, i use the real space bags, and they work, i put tons of clothes i don't wear in them and put it in my closet|`|SBZOVEueaa	i bought the original brand 'space saver' bags -     they do not work    they puff right back up - not to the original size - but it was pretty useless for me    honestly - the best thing that worked for me and did not inflate back up was to use contractor garbage bags w/the vacuum and duct tape it closed - over a year later the bag was still compact    the space saver bag puffed up within a week.....    go figure|`|EmPkyCEiaa	I have used them and sometimes the zipper works good but then others don't. I have found that I prefer ZIP LOC large storage bags.  The zip works better, holds longer and you can remove most of the air. It won't get as flat as the Space saver, but it is stronger and stays flat a lot longer. Plus, Zip Loc is a much stronger material.|`|wKQbNvm9aa	They work great. I have the kind that you just roll and squeeze the air out.  They really do flatten stuff out so that you can get a lot more stuff in the suitcase or under the bed or wherever.   You can flatten pillows and comforters as well and clothes and blankets.|`|RoAeeLPMaa	I haven't personally, but I have heard really good things about them.  My sister says you can keep stuff in them for over a year or more and when you take them out they aren't even wrinkled.  That sounds amazing to me.  I'd go for it.|`|snzTCH5saa	Yes, They are great!  I sent my son a big mattress cover for his bunk in Afghanistan and made it fit in a 12"x12''x 6" h box.  He loved it.  Space Saver different sizes are the ones I used.|`|AA11078284	Yes in fact that's how I moved to Ontario Canada with just two full suitcases.  I put all my belongings in those space bags and vacuumed the air out and pressed them against the suitcase and was able to put two space bags in one suitcase. I would have not been able to put all my clothes in one suitcase had it not been for the space bags.  Of course I had no porter to help me carry my suitcases, and when I arrived at Pearson Airport, there were no porters to lift my suitcase off the conveyor belt so I broke a wheel, it was hard to move them with the heavy weight. But my clothes came with me, and that's how I began again with only two full suitcases. Every else of my stuff was thrown in the garbage by a ex-girlfriend Beverly Wible of Las Vegas, NV who just took all my books and diplomas, and photo albums and dumped them into the trash rather than allowing me to come back for them and have them come in two suitcases again.  But so now I don't bother with accumulating much anymore cause once you loose all your stuff you tend to not care anymore to have anything.  At least I have my new books, music and DVD movies as well as  new clothes for the cold winters here.   I don't recommend any American to move to Canada, what I learned was you have to be here at least 5 yrs before you can even apply for citizenship. So well, if you don't have a sugar daddy in Canada, you have to apply for a workers permit to work in Canada, and if you get a landed immigrant status card you have two full years before you can apply for citizenship.  Can't go back to visit family in USA cause that means it's days subtracted off how many days you were in Canada.  I arrived in Sept 2002, and now in Feb 2009 I can finally apply for Canaidian  citizenship. Why? Cause they automatically subtract two full years off the top, so being here from 2002 to 2004 didn't count  so then you count from 2007 to 2009 with the two full years from the time you get your landed immigrant card to the time you are allowed to get your Canadian application filled out and send in $200 with it  Oh, and ifyou think you have it hard in USA, Canada doesn't look to having Americans come to live in Canada.    Experience, learned the hard way.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Yes yes yes! I love them, but get the largest size, cause it's hard getting stuff in the bag. They do shrink right down. You won't be disappointed.  Get at bed bath and beyond.|`|W5axQzDxaa	I hate mine and gave them all away.  They did deflate down and become flat, but with in 24 hours they were filled up with air again and everything was just as big as before.  The zipper slide to close them was not very good and was hard to keep closed.  I honestly think that they are a waste of money|`|65798b01815336774276b167183ee126aa	I had some and hated them; they lost air after about  a month.  I was able to put just as much stuff in a regular black trash bag (heavy duty or construction type)  and holding the top closed just enough to get the vac hose in ; sucked out the air and it held up a little longer that the space saver bags.  BUT  the big difference was in the cost.  Try it and see; it will only cost you the price of a BOX  of bags compared to 3or4 Space Savers.

ElBaODCCaa	You can pain your cabinets. First you have to get them ready to paint.  If they are real wood, use a liquid de glosser or liquid sanding solution to get the varnish off.  If they are laminate, paint them with an oil based primer such as Kilz or Zap  Then se a color such as Navajo White ( Sherwin Williams) in a semi gloss latex and paint the cabinets. When dry, use a Minwax gel stain such as Special Walnut or an antiquing glaze ( sold at most home improvement stores). Use a soft rag or old t-shirt to rub & pull off the stain to your liking.  I have used this many times and the results are beautiful. I think this will give you the look you are going for.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	The natural maple would lend itself more to a french country feel than stark white but blue countertops would be better with white cabinets.

051a951539f4262540d3c7ba8903b5abaa	A good way to hide ugly carpet is to buy extra remnants from a store and lay over the current carpet. Or you can invest in some snazzy floor rugs and create the look of all new flooring.    While your mother won't allow you to paint black or red, why not use those colors as accents. Paint your walls neutral colors - beige, brown, etc. From there, add the red and black in your sheets, art work, etc. It'll be amazing how a little can go a long way.|`|so9Tj2Jtaa	With a purple carpet you can be quite limited.

However, it looks very dry.    I strongly suggest re-potting plant and blending in 50% expanded shale to greatly improve drainage.

jW8nfcA6aa	Sounds OK but I think you could eliminate the junction box. You will need a new switch box anyway to house 2 switches,so get a large size and bring the wire from outlet into it as before.Then add a pig tail to it to feed the new switch. The outlet should be GFCI to meet Code. Lights are not GFCI however so if you need to change then you might want to pig tail the Line to the outlet and then continue up to the switches so the outlet is fed separately from the wire.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	First of all, ALL splices and cuts must occur in a junction box.  ALL wiring must be by cable in the walls or protected by a wire-way.  In a bathroom, where it's likely that you'll be wet at some time, you   are especially vulnerable to electric shock.  The proper way to do what you propose, is to connect to the   line and neutral wires at the existing switch.  Take those wires to a new box for the new switch.  Connect the power to the new switch.  Take the switched power and the spliced neutral to the new light,   which must be connected to a new box.  If you didn't understand that, get a book on home wiring.  A half-a**ed job in that location is very dangerous.|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a book on home wiring that includes diagrams etc.  Black and Decker publish several that are very good for the average homeowner remodel-er.    I am a professional carpenter and have wired several houses from service (circuit box)  to outlets and have found these books of Immense help upon occasion.  They are worth the $15.00 to $20.00 investment.
y31mee4Faa	The magnatron's probably shot.      Check your paperwork, it may still be under warranty.  If not, you've just found yourself between the rock & hard place.    You can call the manufacturer or check online for a service facility near you & see what an on-site repair costs & what a carry-in repair costs, then weigh those costs against replacing the unit.    Sometimes it really is cheaper to replace the microwave.      Good luck...|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	One of several reasons why I would never have one of these things mounted over my range.   They are monsters to install and remove, properly.     W.C.'s probably correct.  The magnatron tube is the likely culprit.  Unfortunately, unless it's under warranty, it will likely be more expensive than you want to go.   If you have to have one that mounts over the range, then try a different brand.   If you don't have the exhaust feature involved with this one, you'd be better off building a small shelf over the range and buying a smaller unit that would just set there and be easily removeable for service if need be.

Go for it! who cares what your friends say its your room you make it how you want it!|`|5dh1juvjaa	i think that dark purple would look very nice on the wall, but it wouldn't look good with the light pink sheets, change the sheets to orange or green or SOMETHING>.|`|30ad4662919fe0039d27aaea1639ebe5aa	If you do ,I would have  more lighting ,lighter colors|`|oiaBHI0daa	I think that pink and purple kind of clash, but I really like the turquoise sounding one.

SBZOVEueaa	greased lightening    great all purpose cleaner -     if heavy buildup you will probably have to spray a lot on and let soak a while in very hot water|`|RoAeeLPMaa	Soak the fryer in hot soapy water with a box or two of baking soda.  The baking soda will make the water softer, which in turns makes things easier to clean.  And the soapy water will cut the grease.  Soaking time depends on how bad it needs cleaned.  If that doesn't work...you can always use bleach to cut the grease and then wash thoroughly with dish liquid. That's good for killing germs also.  Good luck.
c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	The electrical code was changed in 1996 to require 4 wires for 220V. Other guy was wrong, you have 220V just a pre 1996 outlet.  You can buy a 3 wire cord and wire to your dryer in accordance with the instructions. Or, better would be to pull another ( white ) wire through to your outlet and connect to the return in your breaker box. How hard this would be depends on how large your conduit is and how many corners it goes around. If a straight shot it should not be difficult.  Edit: Corky is the voice of reason. It is because it is easier that most people will replace the cord on the new dryer. If you change the outlet, by code you must upgrade. Retorofit is only required when you move the location or change the outlet. It does not need to be done just because it is currently 3 wire. I have upgraded several at work over the last year to accomodate new equipment. We chose to do this rather than rewire the equipment.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	you have to change the wire on the dryer to match the new outlet.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	you can't change the outlet. Get a 3 wire dryer cord and change it on the dryer.  http://www.ezdiyelectricity.com/?p=445|`|yaq7oaH6aa	The new outlet is 120/240 +Gnd.  The old one can either be 120V. or 240V. depending on whats   connected at your panel.  You should reall have 4 wires, but you don't have those installed.  The 'white' you have may be 'hot'. It should be marked, but often   they aren't. - Find out.  If you have a two pole breaker at the panel, with the   white connected to a pole, you've got the 240.  Read the instructions for the new dryer to see if it's safe to connect   the ground as a neutral with that unit.  Also check that the existing wire and breaker are   large enough to serve the new unit.  The 'required circuit' will be on the nameplate.  (It's not recommended, but sometimes it can work.)|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Back and forth, up and down, around and around we go.  Good to Go should quit answering questions about electricity.  35 years in this business and I've never seen an electric dryer other than a small portable, that used a 110 volt recept. and no one that I know of would mistake it for anything else.   As a couple of other folks have said, just to reitierate, it's much easier and perfectly functional to change the cord on the dryer to three wire, than to change the recept to four wire.   And the electricity police won't come to your door.|`|cDYowiDNaa	You should consult a qualified electrician and have them install it. Don't risk burning your house to the ground.|`|YSAU1e9Paa	You can change the wire on your dryer. That would be easier then changing the outlet.

dEDio8aPaa	I'm assuming the window is in the shower area. It's fine as long as it's aluminum or vinyl. Wood may be a problem. Make sure the tile installers go around/up to the window. If they know what they're doing it should be fine. We do them all the time that way.|`|wM9Vt4iyaa	if you have the window in the shower it should have a good seal on it around the frame of it to keep water out. how about glass blocks instead of the window ,it will be easier to maintain than the window|`|cDYowiDNaa	You can leave the window in, but I would recommend having the contractor slant the bottom window sill and cover it with tile or another water repellent surface so that the water runs off instead of just sitting there. If the water sits on the window sill, It will cause water damage.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	A bathroom must be ventilated, either by a fan or a window.  If the window is in the shower stall, extra care is required to   caulk and seal the frame.  This is especially true if it's one of those plastic 'stall' one piece   insert units.|`|f3c6506505c21cdb2337cc85bae22c4caa	Not unless you have completely sealed windows. A window in a shower is not a good idea unless you get a sky light or replace the window with the "ice block" type windows that you see in other homes. This will insure that you will not have water seeping down into your walls and causing rotting and damage to your home.     I would go with the contractor that told you it was not a good idea, the other sounds like a quack and wants your money.
cDYowiDNaa	No it is not ok to put all three wires under one ground screw. The best thing to do is just to pig-tail a small piece of ground wire to the other three wires and connect with a wire nut. This way you will have only one wire to connect to the ground.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Yeah  I don't think a building inspector would have any problem with that  Twist the grounds together first|`|GiihJqC9aa	wrap the 3 wires together add one leading off to the ground screw ,use a  78 wire nut to make this connection. wrap the leading wire to the ground screw (green)|`|sCMYwtonaa	Yes you can put as many that will fit as long as they are all secure enough. If you can't fit them you will need to secure one wire to the screw and pigtail the others using a wire nut.|`|9c5de07d75d981b60774ab1e37de89bfaa	No, you can only have one wire secured to the ground screw.  There are a couple of ways to do this:  1  Take an 8" piece of wire and fasten this wire and all ground wires with a red wire nut.  Secure the other end of the wire to the ground screw, or    2  Use a green wire nut.  This has a hole in it so one of the three ground wire goes through the wire nut and fastens to the ground screw.  The other two ground wires fasten into the green wire nut.

It is probably a raccoon which is notorious for getting into trash. You either have to buy more garbage cans with lids or set a trap to catch the raccoon. You can get a trap from Lowes or Home Depot in the garden department. Put cat food or fresh vegetables into the trap and put it near your trash or along a fence or a obvious pathway that a raccoon might take to get to your trash. If you catch one don't go near it.

Good luck...|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	You connect them the same way the wires came off the old switch/socket.  In a three way lamp socket/switch, the switching is done internally, not in the wiring.  As you turn from setting to setting the little contacts inside the switch move to touch one or the other or two of the contacts, making three different levels of light.  Just remember you also need a three way bulb to go with it.  Just for most of the folks answering below here that are talking about + and - wires going to one screw or the other, when was the last time you had a lamp apart and could even identify the positive from the negative?

6SwaWSoyaa	Are you completely opposed to painting it. In my opinion, paint looks better, it can be a fun activity and you can get the exact colors and design you want.    I recommend that you buy the two paints you want. Strip your wall of any wallpaper and go over your wall with a bucket of paint primer. Than after that dries paint the light pink go for about 3-4 coats with a paint roller Then take paint tape (blue tape that you can put on your walls and will easily come off) and use two long pieces to form the stripe you want and do this several times around the room. Then take a paintbrush and paint in between the tape with the darker pink.    It may sound more complicated, but it really isn't. Wallpaper can actually be more difficult. Take advantage of this with a friend or family and it can be a bonding experiece also it will give you self-satisfaction.

EcEMMx2Daa	Open your phone book, find a good hardware store, an old one that has been in business forever, go up the the old guy that works the plumbing aisle, he will sell you the parts you need and tell you how to do the repair, its an easy one. Then remember this hardware store and they will sell you better merchandise and free instructions the the big chain home center stores can't.  I go to a store that's 100 years old, they know me by name & always go out of their way to help, there are still lots of these stores around in small towns, hope you can find one where you live.|`|HWqD91fUaa	You will probably have to replace the whole ball and flapper. It's the rubber seal that is not sealing properly or the chain that controls the flapper can become loose or broken. It needs to be the exact length, as a new one, to work properly. You can go to a home depot store(cheapest) or hardware store, to buy the part. It's most likely under $20.00. But find someone who knows how to put it in. And if you try to do it yourself, by all means, turn off the knob behind the toilet that shuts off the water flow, to the toilet, before you begin the process :)|`|mP0LLMVjaa	You need to replace the flush valve.

00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Actually for wintertime that 's the correct setting.  There is a small, usually black, slider switch on the side of the same part of the fan that houses the pull chain for the speed control.  That little switch determines which direction the blades turn.   In winter, the idea is to keep the warm air that naturally migrates to the ceiling, moving, so that it circulates down into the living area.    This summer is when you'll want it blowing down.|`|LU6vfqRzaa	There is a button to reverse the fan blades to go in the other direction.    Should be near the top, by the motor.

When a fan revolves it's blades are fitted in a way to push the air flow downwards.    You might have fixed the blades upside down orthey have got twisted while cleaning.     Be logical and imagine yourself as a fan blade and try to fix its curve to let it push the air downwards/front (accd to type of fan).|`|su4grPAWaa	Either it should be rotating in the wrong direction (it should rotate clockwise and not in anti-clockwise, when you view lying down on floor or bed),  or,    The angle of the blades should have some problem.|`|Ufu6pyjNaa	Its because its spinning the wrong side.

6SwaWSoyaa	If they don't like pink than I am very glad because I think that is so cliche. Do either of your sister like light blue or light green. I would suggest that you paint their rooms these colors. One of them get the light blue and the other light green.    For the eight year old I suggest something similar to this. Of course she will want to personalize it to her taste and this bed will be replaces with a twin bed but I like the general idea.  http://www.decoratingideakidrooms.com/pr...    For the twelve year old I suggest the green room, plus she will soon be a teenager and not a little kid so she will want more of a mature room. Take this room and replace the pink and red stuff with a light green or perhaps orange. Does she like orange? Also add a few more black accents instead of completely white, because that looks a little too feminine and little girlish.    http://lh3.ggpht.com/jessicacwaks/R_zfxf...

Let it sit for a few hours and see if that loosens it. Water in the vase isn't going to do anything except stay in the vase, you need something to get between the vase and table.  If this doesn't work, try moving the vase back and forth a little at a time to see if that will do the trick.

oiaBHI0daa	In the past, the rule of thumb was to wait until the green color faded away. Recent studies have shown that waiting the six to 12 months necessary for this to happen allows the wood to deteriorate too much. To adequately protect treated wood from the harmful effects of rain, snow, mildew and the sun's ultraviolet rays, the wood should be allowed to thoroughly dry first. Then if the wood will accept a finish, coat it with one of the Sherwin-Williams DeckScapes systems.
LZpxKfpTaa	The best way to side a Victorian home is to use steel. 3 reasons:  1. They make a steel siding that is totally seamless.  2. There are 3 or 4 kinds that don't fade and offer lifetime warranties.  3. Will improve the Value of your home.  Some vinyl companies will claim they have seamless but there not  there only about 20 ft sections. Vinyl will fade and if you live where it's cold can break with pressure. Seamless steel is flame retardant.   vinyl is not. A good seamless steel company can show you how your home will look on there laptop. Great colors too.

gP11453Waa	ADDED COMMENT:           Here are some links to give a little more info on water usage.  Maybe you could actually measure how much water you are running--an easy way is to run the shower at your actual flow rate into a container and measure how long it takes to run a known quantity, say, 2 or 3 gallons.     http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_many_gallo...    http://fi.edu/guide/schutte/howmuch.html        Whatever the cause, I hope you get it fixed.      A few things come to mind.      How long are you in the shower before you rinse the conditioner (okay, before the water temperature drops so much)?  This question can tie in with the next one, below, since running the shower with a lot of hot water pressure will deplete the hot water supply quickly.      How much do you open the hot water valve?  You can limit the water flow by placing a reducer in the shower head or by simply not running the water so strongly.  You really don't need a lot of pressure, especially if you take long showers.      Also along the same lines, if when you get the water set and then want to make the water warmer, instead of opening the hot water more, just reduce the cold water.      Good luck...........and do think about spending less time in the shower and using less hot water (or cold water for that matter).|`|jSBtdhf0aa	believe it or not, i also replaced a water heater once with a new one. and it had a faulty heating element it sounds like you are having the same problem.  i would call whoever instal;led it, they should replace the element free of charge.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	try turning the thermostat for the water heater up higher. I have mine set to the hottest setting.|`|XYTUAzzgaa	maybe it's filling too slowly|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	Actually these things are tricky to diagnose without being there to check, but if you're not capable of checking the elements and the wiring then you need to get someone who is.  If you have confidence in the plumber you had install the new unit in the first place then have him come back to do it, it's definitely not right.  There's no way you can heat 40 gallons of water and only get a 5 - 10 min. shower, unless you're using one of those showers with eight or ten jets of water spraying at you from all angles.    If for some reason the unit was electrically energized before ALL the air was bled out of the top of the tank, it could have burned off the top element.  I've seen it happen, had to follow a couple of young fellows on their first installation at one of my customer's homes to find that.  I've also seen the top element thermostat wired wrong, FROM THE FACTORY, so that needs to be checked as well.     One last thing, DO NOT listen to Chicagogirl.  Turning the temp setting on the tank up to over 130 degrees, and they will go much higher, is a good way to scald someone.  It makes water so hot you can't stand to have your hand under it.
AA11474133	With the 50A breaker protecting the feeder, the main breaker in the garage panel is not important.  You don't say if the garage is attached or detached.  That determines other rules.  The main breaker being the disconnect and needing a grounding electrode system (maybe just a ground rod, maybe more) are things needed for a separate building, like a detached garage.  If it is an attached garage, it would be no different than a subpanel in the house, and no disconnect or special grounding needed.  These are rules of the national electrical code.    You would need 6-3 with ground either way.  Having the separate ground and neutral connection is needed for either an attached or detached garage.    Another thing, if a detached garage, "romex" is not allowed outside so you'll need UF or some other wet location wiring method.|`|e633e8f12f9b39576e9ea6e1617f2cbdaa	that should work, you could probably go with up to 125amp sub panel. and yes 6-3 would be sufficent.|`|VllPwIysaa	You can use the 100 amp panel as a sub panel in your garage. The 100 amp main circuit breaker in the sub panel won't be doing anything since the 50 amp breaker in your main panel will trip before the 100 amp. Leave it in, though. It will still count as the "disconnect" for the sub panel.  The 6-3 wire will work for the 50 amp feeder, but you will need to run a ground wire as well if the cable doesn't have one already.  The neutral bus in the sub panel must not be bonded to the ground wire. Do not install the bonding screw or strap on the neutral bar. If its a new panel, the screw or strap is usually loose in the panel. If its a used panel, look for a screw that goes all the way through the neutral bar and into the metal box.  The only place the neutral can be bonded to the ground is in the main panel, thats why you need 4 wires to feed the sub panel (2 hots, neutral, and ground). The ground bar is mounted directly to the box, the neutral bar is mounted on a hard plastic mounting bracket.  One other thing to think about, local codes in my area call for a ground rod to be driven at the second panel. You may want to call your local inspector and see if there are any special things for your area to consider.

VFmmVHGVaa	If you have done resent work on the hot water its possible that particles may have gotten in your faucets ,try cleaning the hot water side.  t|`|FO0jlQFyaa	The only other possiblity is a reduction in the line leading to the heater or coming out of the heater. Are all valves fully open, are the valves in good shape, or has the O-ring flattened with time and is now partially closing the line. A kink in the pipe|`|C5UUltHtaa	The problem may be the valve above your hot water heater that supplies the water to the tank or the valve on the outlet side (if there is one)    If you have galvanized pipes the inside of the pipes could be corroded (rust, calcium) and the hot always gets this condition before cold. Blowing compressed air through it won't remove it. If you have copper or cpvc (pvc is for cold water, cpvc is for hot) then that won't be the case. The reason the hot water works fine at first is the pressure is good which will push the water through after the valve is open for a few moments then the pressure drops to a point where the water flow is reduced because of the restricted passage inside the pipe.  Just note the problem is common to all hot side outlets so it will be in the main lines that run through-out the house beginning at the hot water tank.  Sorry; This all I can think of at this time.  Good Luck|`|c2E0GBqpaa	This could also possibly be the built-in check valve of your new tank not operating correctly...I've been plumbing 20 yrs. and, on occasion, have found faulty checks in the tank...if you get decent pressure, and then it suddenly dies off.  Also, you could have some solder caught behind a valve...imagine a heavy stone in a winebottle that you suddenly invert: you have a good spill until the stone blocks the neck...one way to find out would be to cut the hot line and drain with a bucket after turning off the main water supply(don't open any faucets yet as you want some pressure).  If nothing foreign ends up in the bucket, open a faucet on the top floor, furthest away from the tank and see what you get into the bucket(have a spare handy).  If still nothing, you may have some old galvanized piping btwn. the tank and the nearest fixture which will thus affect all fixtures in the home(galv. will rust internally and eventually shrink to a pinhole).  If still no resolution, call the installers back to ensure the check valve(s) aren't faulty...good luck.
LU6vfqRzaa	While they are not sleeping remove the stairs and store on the top bed.  The stairs should be removable, if not fold to the top bunk.    Other wise, teach your child to NOT climb the stairs.  Period.    :-)      Hmmmmm, attached?  Well, either contact the manufacturer or maybe if you are handy enough, you might be able to remove it, cut it, and make it so that you can place it back when in use.     I would call the manufacturer first and tell them and see if they have any options for you.    Again, you need to teach your children that they must not climb it.  I know it's hard to always keep an eye on them, but seriously, they can get hurt.  Maybe just detach the two beds, like most do, and when they are older then make it a bunk bed.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Why not get a different type of bunk beds so you don't have to worry about it?

LU6vfqRzaa	Being it is a keepsake item, I would definitely bring it to the dry cleaners to let them look at it and maybe fix the problem.      Don't try any home remedies.  that is just me, I wouldn't want to take the chance of ruining it any more.      :-)|`|J7ByVZ3Aaa	What kind of marker is it? What kind of material is the baptismal outfit?  If it's an easily washable material (like cotton) and the marker is water based, I'd just try and get it off at home. There is a great stain remover called kiss off that I use to get oil paint and grease stains out of my clothes. If you don't feel comfortable doing it at home, definitely go to the dry cleaners.

You can try the soapy water spray treatment, I've never had much luck with it.  I use Spectracide Kill-a-bug on my plants (bad mealy bug invasion last season) without harming them.  Plumeria don't like wet feet, overwatering will kill them.    Here's a serious infestation of spider mite image: http://images.search.yahoo.com/images/vi...|`|aFIjyDppaa	if the top of the soil sticks to your finger when you touch it. its been over watered.
4rYDpMAgaa	Most Sun Blocks are oil based.    You will have to wash the areas with Varsol or Thinners.  Do not do this in the winter or when the heating is on.  Both Varsol and Thinners are very volatile.    This should be done in the warm weather with your windows open in more than one room so you get a cross draft.  do not switch any electrical equipment on or off or have any open flames (pilot lights, gas/propane appliances, etc) while using Varsol or Thinners.    After cleaning the areas, let dry and air out for a few hours.  Sand and prime the whole wall(s) - gives more even finish when done. Best to paint all walls of room.    If you do not paint, the stains will still show.    Read the instructions on selected Primer and finish coat paint.

I've used them many times for patterns, we've made about fifty quilts from them.|`|Xw7vmK3laa	A duvet and comforter would be nice.  Target has them.  You could also use sheets.  Your mattress is 60" wide and 80" long?  You don't need a pattern.  Mark on fabric with a light PERMANENT Sharpie.  Good luck.
ZxSZWfd0aa	Anything that is used other than it is meant to be used for can do harm.    If you are using RePhresh to eliminate odor and minor discomfort "down there," just be sure to use it as directed, and it should be okay.  If you are sexually active, you need to see your doctor to rule out any disease, like chlamydia, that could cause odor and itching.    Folic acid is a naturally occurring substance that is important for the formation of red and white blood cells. Folic acid can be found in almost every multi-vitamin and also in every day foods like dried beans, peas, lentils, oranges, whole-wheat products, liver, asparagus, beets, broccoli, brussels sprouts, and spinach. A folic acid overdose is unlikely to threaten life.|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	no darling... just don't put it direct there... it can cause irritation... and even worse...|`|9a9bc3fcd75b9c1aaf0f67c0fead9c6caa	not a gardening question
HgEZsovZaa	dirty flame sensor . it not letting the furnace prove a flame is present . it is not the vent pressure switch like the other guy said or it would not light at all. the flame sensor can be cleaned by sanding it or scraping it with knife .|`|LzyAn6uOaa	There is a vacume switch connected to your flue by a 1/4" black rubber hose.  Sometimes this becomes clogged.  The vacume switch is about 2-3" in diameter and what it does is see if the flue is drawing a vacume or not.  Look at the opening of this and shove an unfolded  paperclip into the opening to see if you can dislodge it.  Also your furnace has a light on the circuit board that will flash a code.  Look in your manual or on the cover of the furnace to decipher its meaning.
