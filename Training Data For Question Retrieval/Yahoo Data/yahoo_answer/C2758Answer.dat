If they have any distinguishing birthmarks, try naming them after that. For instance, if they have tiny spots everywhere, name them Speckles or Spot. Just make sure you don't name them any name thar rhymes with "no" like Snow or Beau or anything else.

Mw49Vjs6aa	I'm a dog musher in Alaska.  This is a fairly common problem among sled dogs.    Yes, you can put any over-the-counter antibiotic ointment on his spores, and he'll probably be much more comfortable if you do so.  If the future you may consider dabbing some petroleum jelly or specialty foot ointment between his pads before letting him play in the snow for a long period of time.  Another option, used by most long-distance mushers, is to use booties to protect his feet.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	There is a product called "Bag Balm"! It comes in a green, square, tin container and has a red clover on the lid! You can find it in most Drug Stores! It's under $10 and you can use it safely on just about anything you can imagine. Both humans and animals can use it. I think it would really help soften and heal your dogs paw pads. Before you reapply it, check your dogs paw pads first. You don't want to soften them up too much. It's not toxic and it works. Please do not use Salt Water again. Putting salt into an open wound is extremely painful.|`|3SMvCETmaa	I would recommend plain petroleum jelly. It holds in moisture in the skin and helps with chapped skin.. I use it on the pads of my dogs feet to help her when they get too dry..|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No your dog will only lick it off.  The pads are breathable & need to stay that way.  You can use Musher's secret or bag balm.  Unless the cracks are severe where the dog is bleeding, I would leave alone. Dogs often had cracked pads & it bothers you more than the dog. They are not the same material like skin & being cracked or rough isn't harmful unless too deep.|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Salt water?? Ouch.  A teeny pit of polysporin will be ok but if the cracks aren't oozy or bloody, consider putting some liquid bandage spray on them to give a layer of protection.  If they need cleaning again, use a little hyrdogen peroxide.  Let it bubble up to clean out the wound then dab dry.  No more salt water.|`|WbRhr0OYaa	I use Burt's Bees hand salve. It is beeswax based and all natural. It sooths cracked paws. I use this after long walks and hard exercise to keep the dogs pads in good shape.|`|2qVcpkF3aa	Musher's Secret! It works and it helps prevent from getting snow in between their toes. If there's open wounds, I would call your vet. You should try it. Good luck!
vfhKkiSKaa	Absolutely|`|im3vWyv6aa	Yes, all dogs need to be protected from high heat... especially dogs like Huskies. Get them a kiddie pool to lay in and some sprinklers to play in. Anything to give them a way to cool off. Our Huskies would lounge around in the kiddie pools, the same way we lounge around on the couch.|`|W0buucLsaa	Yeah, it's called heatstroke. Contrary to popular belief, though, huskies are not nearly as susceptible to it as many other dogs. (This is partially because they aren't very large, and partially because they shed off one of their coats during the summer.)    Mastiffs, though they have very short hair, are much less heat-tolerant than huskies. Newfoundlands are VERY heat intolerant. Great Pyrenees are fairly heat intolerant.    Any large dog that isn't heat-loving (like Greyhounds for example are very heat tolerant) should be kept inside during hot summer temperatures.|`|AA10412922	Any dog can die from hot temperatures|`|ybwqYZ1waa	Not common. If you live in a hot place then you shouldn't own a husky. If you live in a hot place and you DO own a husky then you should shave its fur. That will make it not hot and sweaty.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Yes, it's called heat exhaustion.  As a nordic breed they are more accustom to the cooler temps and are easily subjected to heat exhaustion.  Lots of cool water to drink, shade, a pool to lay in even, and moderate exercise and never at the peak heat of the day...DO NOT EVER SHAVE A SIBERIAN HUSKY!!!  I cannot stress this enough!  Their guard hairs aid in cooling them and protect them from sunburns and skin cancer!|`|zH1sg3Xraa	yes. I keep my Chow in the Air Conditioning mostly in the summer. A dog needs to be taken care of just like a human.|`|zsnKf57Maa	I don't think it's right to own a husky in hot places!   I guess they could die if it gets way too hot to handle!|`|2ofzcrdGaa	First of all why is your dog living outside? and i think you should put a fur jacket on and go stand outside in 120 degree heat and you tell me.|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	I'm a dog musher in Alaska, running freighting types of Alaskan huskies.  Heat exhaustion and heat stroke can both strike huskies.

Kb6eTkbGaa	You can cut the patch of fur with not harm to the cat... or if you don't want a patchy pet, soak a cotton ball in acetone based finger nail polish remover; rub the affected area until glue is gone, and then wash the area thoroughly with your cat's shampoo. Do this all in one step so the cat isn't able to lick or ingest any of the acetone from it's fur.   You will want to do this soon, so the cat doesn't attempt to clean the glue off and ingest some.|`|shRzfEHuaa	I would cut off the fur asap.  I don't know what kind of glue you used, but you don't want the kitty licking the fur and eating the dried glue.  The dried glue could be toxic, and a cat will like the glued fur for sure.    EDIT:  what are the ingredients in the glue?  usually dried glues are less toxic then when they are liquid.  Don't worry too much, the glue may have flaked off, especially if the fur is oily|`|mxMLaVNgaa	I would first get warm and make the fur around the glue wet then i would cut it out if its possiblel. but if that doesnt work then i would just leave it alone.|`|RmNVL1RWaa	this kinda stuff happens to my cat too. If it's only on the skin, put something bitter on it like lemon juice that makes your lips pucker for 2 weeks on it, then, when he starts to shed his fur, it will come off...    that or just wait for it to grow off and you can live with a cat that needs to be in rehab|`|c4f8a63972685e95e511d29969f672a3aa	Can you cut out the fur?|`|AA10977773	Cutting the hair is the best thing. Anything that will remove the glue is usually more toxic than the glue. Surgical glue is basically super glue with a blue dye and is not very toxic.
TSc8OE4vaa	-You seem to get "puppy dog hands"- work on your hand position, your thumbs need to be the highest part of your hand.  This helps communicate with the horse better.  -I really like your seat, it looks good  -Stay in jumping position (two-point) for a little longer after the jump.  You look like you slam into the saddle a bit too hard after the jump which is hard on your pony's back.      Overall pretty good, you seem to be effectively communicating with your horse and it works pretty well for you.  Make sure you keep taking lessons and good luck!|`|AA11498082	Watch the vid - especially when you're on the grey.  Your banging the beegeezes out of that horse's mouth.|`|DrEgX4QNaa	I Think You Did Great.    Just A Few Tips    - Maybe two-Point A Bit Longer  - Hands Could Be In Better Position (Thumbs Up)  -Maybe heels Down A Bit More But No Stirrups Is A Valid Excuse :)|`|fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	Great heals!  The girl on the grey horse has horrible heals.  It takes a great deal of leg muscle to ride without stirrups so way to go!!|`|xvEJbqtfaa	Where you the only one in this video? I wasn't sure who was who, but this is what I picked up on who I thought you were. :)     - Make sure your leg stays in position. I think in one clip your toes were really behind your knee. It seemed good the rest, so it was probably a fluke, just watch for that.     - Relax a little more with your hips and torso over jumps, but really hold with your legs, specifically your thighs. This will make it easier to do what I'm about to suggest.     - Try holding your two point longer over the fence, and really stay still with your legs. They kind of slide around, which is why you're coming out so early, I think. Build muscle with posting without stirrups, ect.     - Watch your hands. Make sure they don't get spread wide apart or flexed. Keep your thumbs up and wrists straight.     - Make confident turns. In the beginning, there was a slightly hectic turn where you go to the fence and then start trotting. I don't know if that was on purpose, but if it was try cantering a little longer on the rail so you have a nice, straight stop. Never "settle." Always make sure your horse does what you want to do, and if you want to keep canter, by golly, make him! :)    Overall, very good. You looked like you kept your heels down, which is hard and annoying without stirrups. You had a good seat with the flat work. Not even a good seat, a stupendous seat! You made your horse work for the most part, but I couldn't tell whether it was the martingale or you. I'll give you the benfit of the doubt though. :) Great job, you're a nice rider!
Jtd7kXQSaa	Ok the other 2 people are right. But the males will usually only have the bumps on their gills when they are ready to spawn. Females will be just a little fatter. Goldfish only spawn once a year in the spring time. How ever in the aquarium it is harder to get them to spawn.  Goldfish, like all Cypriots, lay eggs. They produce adhesive eggs that attach to aquatic vegetation. The eggs hatch with Goldfish can only grow to sexual maturity if given enough water and the right nutrition. However if kept well, they may breed indoors. Breeding usually happens after a significant change in temperature, often in spring. Eggs should then be separated into another tank, as the parents will likely eat any of their young that they happen upon. Dense plants such as Cabomba or Elodea or a spawning mop are used to catch the eggs.in 48 to 72 hours.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	When a goldfish reaches sexual maturity the easiest way to tell males from females are the white pimple-like marking they get on their gill covers called tubercles.     Goldfish reach sexual maturity at about one year, at which time they should be at least six inches long.     You need to buy them a much larger tank or a pond. The ten gallon tank is not a suitable home, let alone a suitable spawning environment. Six comet goldfish produce too much waste and cannot be healthy in such a small tank.|`|zMAoWihQaa	1  Get someone else to help you look closely at your fish. It isn't easy to keep up with the movement of your fish, especially when you are trying to concentrate on one small area of your fish's body.  Step2  Look for a thick pectoral, or breast, fin. The male goldfish will have a thicker pectoral fin than a female.  Step3  Look for small white specks or bumps on the gills of your goldfish. The males will have these specks, or tubercules, on their gills while the females won't.  Step4  Female goldfish have a much smaller pectoral fin on their bodies. This fin is also much thinner than the male's pectoral fin.  Step5  If you don't see the white tubercules on your fish's gills, she's a female. Please look carefully for the white specks. You don't want to miss them and think your male goldfish is a female.
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Chocolate sauce is like candy, it's not real chocolate, so it isn't toxic to your dog.  Your dog might get diarrhea and an upset stomach but he's going to be ok.  Don't feed him anything else today, make sure he's got plenty of water to drink and be prepared for him to have diarrhea.  He'll be ok.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Try to get him to throw up, QUICKLY, if you have ipecac force feed it to him.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	All you can do is wait for a Vet to be available to you.  For the vet's refrence, see if he's constipated, has diariah, or hasn't had a BM in a while. Don't feed him anything except the regular dog food, and water until a vet tells you other wize. The only other advice I have to you is find a vet ASAP. This could be as important as to what kind of wood your kitchen table is, or can be as vital as your dog suffering from internal organ damage. The only way to tell is to check in with your vet, don't ignre it. I hope your dog feels better! ; ) *crosses fingers*|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Call your vet and ask.  And from now on, do not leave any source of chocolate anywhere where he can reach it!|`|EeJMITyCaa	Listen to walking lady. Just leave out a bowl of water and don't let them have any food today and probably for a very small meal for breakfast if he wants it. Make sure you don't let him have run of those house. Gate the kitchen off or put him in a bathroom or washeroom because if his stomach doesn't agree with that ice cream he won't be able to control where he eliminates even if he is house trained. I hope your dog is okay.|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Right now, give him a tsp. of hydrogen peroxide. Make sure he swallows it. It will cause him to vomit the stuff up before it digests.  You need to do this within 40 mins of ingesting the chocolate/ice cream.  If he doesn't throw up within 5 mins of the peroxide, give one more teaspoon.    Call the emergency vet to confirm what I've told you.  It's safe and commonly done, but you should never trust advice from unkown people on the internet without confirming it with your vet.  The chocolate is likely to not hurt him but because he's small, it's not worth taking a chance. Help him vomit it up...better safe than sorry..|`|cwwbIWtQaa	Is he acting unwell? If he's acting poorly, you need to get him to an emergency vet.|`|mEzVgC7Kaa	I would keep him in your sight. There are emergency vets and I suggest going to one. This is serious the chocolate is.

I think it is a wait and see thing.|`|Kb6eTkbGaa	***********How To Induce Vomiting*************  You want to make it as easy as possible for your dog to vomit. Some food in her stomach will make it easier for her. Feed her a slice of bread or a few crackers. Or try a tablespoon or two of dog food if you don't feed her "human" food.   Follow these steps.    1 tsp of three percent hydrogen peroxide, given now. With a plastic syringe if you have it ( you can deliver stream to back of throat and make your dog swallow)    Wait ten minutes. If she hasn't yet started to vomit, repeat   Call your vet immediately if she doesn't vomit after the second dose.  You can also do this by using syrup of ipecac instead of hydrogen peroxide.   Your dog may start vomiting and not be able to stop after you give her ipecac syrup, so be prepared to take her to the clinic for follow-up care.    **********Call your local animal control 24 hour number to get a referal to an emergency vet in your area.**********      If you know your pet has ingested large quantities of chocolate, do not wait for symptoms to occur, induce vomiting and take him to the vet immediately!  Symptoms occur within a few hours, but have been known to be delayed for as long as 24 hours. It can take as long as 3 days for the dog to recover completely.   Vomiting  Diarrhea  Urinary Incontinence  Hyperactivity  Rapid Breathing and Heart Rate  Muscle Tremors  Seizures  Coma|`|Au0HK3O6aa	Has he shown any signs of being ill?

Then wrap it with a bandage or self adhesive vet wrap (you can get this at a pet store too). However get him to the vet ASAP and make sure that the nail is covered well when your dog goes outside so that nothing can get in it and get infected.

Some cats will fight now and then,though,especially in multi-cat households,and it is just something that you have to be aware of.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	You have given some clues.  The father cat was only recently neutered.  That means his hormone levels are still elevated, and they will take awhile to recede.  If the son has not been neutered, he may be becoming sexually mature, so there will be hormone level problems.    The dominant male will want to chase other rivals away, so that likely is the problem, especially if the younger male has not been neutered.    And, if the females have not been both spayed, there are layers upon layers of problems showing up. (Females get spayed, not neutered.)|`|un0C52G8aa	You would be best to keep them separated until the kitten is older. Even though he is five months old, he's still small enough to be seriously injured by an adult cat. It sounds like they are trying to establish dominance, which is normal and inevitable, but wait a while until the kitten is bigger and can better defend himself.

Even my Min. Italian Greyhound likes it and she would only eat her wet food before I started giving her little bites of the Beneful.|`|a6an2aN0aa	There really is not a "best" dog food brand, as it all depends on the dog, but if I was ever looking for a good dog food, I would check out the 4, 5, or 6 star rated foods on this list: http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...    At the moment, my dogs are being fed Canidae ALS and they are doing really nicely on it! 8)    However, it is easy to tell you the bad dog foods. Foods like:  Pedigree  Purina  IAMS  Science Diet  Beneful  Eukanuba  Kibbles 'n' Bits  Alpo  Ol' Roy  Eukanuba  anything sold in Wal-Mart and other supermarkets.    These are DREADFUL foods. Never feed them to your dog!! Your dog will thank you.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Go Natural  It is more expensive then most dog foods. However, it is one of the best qualities.  You will feed your dog less.  For example the recommended serving for a 50 lb dog is 2 cups a day.    15 lb dog is .5 cups a day.     I have three dogs of various sizes and purchase a 30lb bag and it lasts me over a month. It does cost me $75 per bag. They also use free range chickens in their products.|`|YW29Fe8Yaa	We were told to look for dry food that had a meat as the first ingredient in the food|`|kUnvlr3Oaa	Hi... :)  Well every kind works differently for every dog.  I think its best to feed your dog a high quality kibble with out all the 'fillers', like wheat and corn.  If I had to pick a favorite I would say Merrick and Wellness for canned and Merrick for dry kibble.  For the price though I would say Chicken Soup For The Dog Lover's Soul....|`|5af8PNwxaa	Hi.    When your saying he is getting a little old, I figure you mean he is older that 7yrs.    Older dogs are prone to get arthritis which is painful for them and if neglected they get quite irritable as you can imagine being being in so much pain.   They need Seniors food which has a little extra than the normal dog food to help their deteriorating joints as well as their stomach.    Just remember, they still need to have lots of exercise to help with their mobility.    http://www.dogslife.com.au/dogs_life_art...    Good luck.|`|0bb8d8b440881763ab137e16962e21d3aa	Don't do raw unless you are absolutely sure of the quality of the raw meat! Parasites and their eggs, cysts, etc, can live in the meat. That is why you are told to thoroughly cook the meat YOU eat. Science Diet and Purina Pro Plan are great. I switched my dogs to science diet (light for my lab and he lost the weight he needed). Also, my beagle stopped have vomiting episodes like she had on purina dog chow. Avoid the "cheap" brands like Old Roy and Pedigree,and any generic brand. They often have a lot of junk in them.|`|yjT6ToTCaa	Solid Gold is a really good food or Natural Balance.
T7QN2IzGaa	If your horse is alone in the trailer shipping boots are not extremelyu necessary. If she has managed to injure herself in the past then they may a be good preventative measure.     However, I i dislike shipping boots for long trips because I feel like like they fail to provide the horse any support. For a trip as long as your's I definitely suggest polo wraps with quilts underneath. The wrap will provide the same protection as a boot and will provide support against stocking up.    Best of luck.|`|6j4igZ9Haa	yeah, that would make sense!   Boots can help prevent those minor injuries when traveling.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	I would use shipping boots just to be safe, I mean why not just take the extra step to insur your horses safety. I use them even only on short 15-20 min. rides. Get in the habbit now so that you don't keep letting it slip.|`|MInCz0Keaa	I would|`|xt2pe0TOaa	You should defenatly put shipping boots on her. Prefurably the tall ones.  When trailering your horse do you have a hay bag in the trailer with hay ?   If not then you should get one to occupi your horse.  Hope this helps.  Good Luck!!|`|AA11096223	I agree with powhattan - I also use polo wraps or quilt wraps on long trips for support.  I generally do not use them for short trips, but it wouldn't hurt if you are concerned about a second injury.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Yes, if it's not too hot outside.  I once saw one sweat under the wraps, then he got itchy and rubbed all of the skin raw because it was so itchy.  Make sure you wrap properly, make sure the boots fit, and if your horse is a bad traveler it is not a sin to give it some tranquilizers, if she's a bad trailerer you will both be happier if she is sedated.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	yes. if you want to be even safer, then use shipping wraps. they're more reliable, and don't slip around as much as shipping boots; most pros use them to transport their horses.   also, you might want to think about:  -a cooler/sheet  -a helmet (for your horse)  -sheepskin shipping halter  good luck|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Yes.  I wouldn't risk it, and since its a MUCH longer drive, definitely put on the shipping boots.  I also suggest a blanket, and horse helmet, if the horse isn't a big fan of trailers!  Hope this helps!
CtYqMs5Paa	PeTA would love it if everyone spayed/neutered until there are no more animals for companions left...they are for complete animal liberation, and that means no owning of animals in any way shape or form...I'm not a hunter or trapper and I don't agree with terrorists either.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	They are in support of this because it reduces the population of homeless animals.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	One question your a hunter right. do you agree with shooting wolves from helicopters is fair hunting? just wondering    well PETA does feel that spay and neutering is good, but i really could care less about PETA because they are domestic terrorists.    Edit- people hunting isnt a bad thing when done right and in season. my uncle hunts turkeys and deer but only when its their season.    Edit- yeah i dont think that its really hunting if you are shooting from a helicopter, i mean the wolf has no chance.     Like i said my uncle hunts he uses the meat, my grandfather used to hunt everyday that was their dinner for the night.    Edit- I personally dont like hunting for fur but thats me. I also dont like hunting as sport like hunting from helicopters.|`|ydshiNrKaa	They are all for spaying and neutering pets.|`|o6uwV66jaa	PETA is all for it, It's what they believe  in most . .= less strays . .|`|fFqzD3aMaa	Nicole is right, how dare you hunt a kill sweet delicious animals! You have no right to do what humans have done since before we even evolved into homo sapiens.

Those are some. I would highly suggest looking at more at Equinehits.com. They're a great site!    Good luck!|`|sbB0TpGXaa	I can pick up dozens each year here.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	It should be ridiculously easy, as no two year old should be broken...|`|UeaZY4BTaa	Have you look at:    equinehits.com  horseclicks.com  dreamhorse.com  craigslist.com     if you have, consider attending local horse auctions. With the horse market so downhill today, there are actually quite a few quality horses going through.|`|fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	Here in Washington there is a TON.  I got my 3 year old unbroke horse for free.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Try looking at unraced racehorses.  A lot of racehorses are too short or too slow to race and so the owner just sells them before even racing them.  These horses might need a bit more work but are worth it in the end.  I have an off-track thoroughbred and she is one of the smartest horses I've ever worked with, and she's impossible to spook- after seeing the track nothing scares her!  The downside is that she loves to run and is a bit hard to slow down, especially for inexperienced riders.    Even a raced racehorse would be okay if it had no injuries and was retired young.    I agree with the auction idea.  Many auction places will let you ride the horse first, but BE CAREFUL a lot of them are unscrupulous.  I went to an auction a few weeks ago and I saw the most gorgeous warmblood sell for just $600, he was jumping 2'6" easy and he definitely had the scope to go to 3'6".  He sold for so little because he was an English horse and everyone buying there was western... I wish I had room for another horse!|`|7lsU5bcoaa	http://www.dreamhorse.com/show_horse.php...  cute, but a yearling, so you'd have to wait but he looks nice  http://www.dreamhorse.com/show_horse.php...  very pretty and is going to be a nice height, so very marketable  http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...  umm cheap and free, theres the free appendix yearling and one of the paints is unstarted, but who knows what these horses are like, going for so cheap the paint they posted looks half decent, nice hip and legs look ok (don't take my word for it, im no confo expert)  http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...  too bad shes bred, she seems really cute  http://horsetopia.horse-for-sale.org/cla...  bay snow cap app, ridden very lightly, no pictures but sounds like they did their groundwork right|`|7cm4dZVaaa	I agree with the other poster.  There are lots adn lots of them out there, at really good prices, too.  I would keep checking with breeders, they have to feed them, and will have new foals coming on.

TSc8OE4vaa	-None of them will fall off while you're riding if they're on properly.  When a leather falls off it's because the saddle is failing, not because the leather is.  -Get leather, not synthetic it is much nicer.      Just go with the cheapest leather pair you can find, unless you are showing in which case look for something a little fancy, maybe with nicer stitching or something.|`|9UttDvcsaa	I would go with Ovation.  Also I have bought stuff from Equiteric before and they ship very fast and usually have great deals on stuff.  Ovation isn't a bad brand, they use qualtiy materials they just don't have the high price although the stirrup leather will take longer to break in.  If you can't find something in leather for what you are doing synthetic would be just fine as well and there is no need to break it in.  :-)

93SlVmoHaa	There is no exact answer to that question as far as I know. But if you want we can come up with one.   Domestic ducks, at least the most common breeds, tend to live from 10 to 15 years in captivity. We know ducks mature in one year. We also know that they do not usually reproduce their last years (usually their 2 to 3 years of life).  Therefore, it seems logical that ducks will be productive for 7-11 years.    We have to take into consideration also the breed. In general females or breeds that produce more eggs spend their bodies faster. So if you have ducks that produce many eggs, I would expect the productive time to be less.  Food is also a very important factor. Balanced diets rich in proteins tend to extend the productive period and/or increase productivity.  I have not had many domestic ducks and never let them breed because I bred wild ducks so my knowledge of domestic ducks is not great.   I remember though that the most prolific bred was one called "running duck". Females from this bred could produce around 300 eggs a year. But may be things have changed lately and new breds have came up.    More information about breeding ducks and different breeds can be found in    www.liveducks.com  http://members.cox.net/gsdvominsel/duckb...  I hope you find this of some help.|`|j4rirb8laa	As long as they can
T7QN2IzGaa	My favorite songs are usually sound tracks from movies because people recognize the tunes but aren't distracted by the songs message or words. Unless that is what you are going for of course.    I once rode a demonstration to "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" theme song, it was a lot of fun. Here a few other suggestions:    Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack  Indiana Jones theme song  Irish/celtic music has excellent rhythmns to ride to.  Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy  Classical music is excellent for dressage|`|vaulPrAmaa	horse with name  desperado|`|lsIHSdgeaa	I'm yours (jason mraz)|`|RKdH1VZyaa	I would say Sweet Home Alabama, but it's probably a tad too...vulgar for children to really hear. Though it has a rollicking beat that would go nicely with a collected canter.     A friend of mine did a reining class with music one time to Your Guardian Angel by The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. It was really cute, since it was a costume class and she dressed as an angel.
FcR8G8hPaa	You have set yourself on a course that is difficult but also potentially rewarding. At the same time, you are right to recognize the risk to the horse. You do need to get this right.    I strongly recommend reading two specific books that I think are a huge help to trainers. One is Yvonne Barteau's "Ride the Right Horse" http://www.amazon.com/Ride-Right-Horse-U... and the other is either one of two books by Andrew McLean - "The Truth About Horses" or "Academic Horse Training" (http://www.aebc.com.au/shop/).    The rest is going to come from experience, care, patience and your own emotional maturity. You're going to face frustration. You will make mistakes you have to fix. You do have a trainer as a resource to help you, and that's more than many who try to do this have; and you have training experience. Leverage your trainer as a resource, but also be willing to listen to yourself.    Helping a spooky or nervous horse grow into its potential is a terrific thing to accomplish. I hope it works out well for you. Best wishes!|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Dont worry!  You have a trainer to help you.  Leading- she sounds good if you can walk her over and under bridges, past mirrors, ect....  only being in a paddock- well, that's gonna be hard, but the horse has to learn, right?  She'll get used to it!  Riding- the trainer will help you if she goes totally spooky, but she sounds like an amazing horse!  Please don't sell her.  She's coming along great, as it sounds.  I am sure she will be fine!  You are worrying too much and looking into the future, but you should be concentrating on NOW.  Please, please, keep her.  You will regret it later if you sell her!  PLEASE keep her!  I would hate to see you sell her.  I wouldn't see it, but I would hate to know that you are.  I had a stage like this when I was training my mare.  Now, we're doing dressage, 4-H, shows, starting jumping, trails, ect.  She is great but I had my doubts.  Its okay to be fearful, but dont show your horse okay?  Hope this helps!|`|T7QN2IzGaa	I understand, when I was nine I was presented a 3 year old paint. He was broke but just barely. He wore a tie-down and side reins just so I could on him. He was horrible, he bucked, he reared, he bolted, he was afraid of everything, he leapt, he plunged, he crashed into walls, he laid down, he would rub you off on walls, crash into stalls, drag you outside the arena, and bolt when you tacked him up. AND YET, after 3 months of continuous riding, we placed third in a western pleasure class. And the two that placed above us were wearing tie downs.     What I'm saying is that perserverance pays off. In the words of Dory from Finding Nemo, "just keep swimming". The road was long and hard. There were plenty of shouting matches, choice words, tears, sweat, and blood exchanged between that paint and I, but in the end we were a team.      Horses are what you make them. Don't be afraid to ask questions and ask for help. I could never take all the credit of training that horse for myself. I had a good instructor, supportive parents, and helpful friends. It took long and it was not pretty but he returned to his owners a dead broke, bomb proof horse. Ironically I ran across him in a show ring at a local schooling show and his new owners were happy and safe with him.    On one final note, don't get discouraged. Horses always find a way to humiliate you at the most unoportune times. My 18 year old gelding is completely bomb proof and completely broke. And yet he still manages to run away with me at speed shows. I've learned that it is easier to laugh it off then fret. Okay, i'm done my long winded story. Good luck and stay safe.|`|vaulPrAmaa	I know the feeling - My first (and only) horse we bought when she was 2, and now she's 4.  She's a perfect green broke now, but at most times it seemed like there was no end in sight!  We overcame rearing, bucking, bits, kicking, leaning, etc.  Just be consistent, and do repetative drills.  Take your time, and make slow advancements so that the horse gets things covered.  Don't move on before your horse has completely overcome what you're working on.  Just be consistent - everything will fall into place!|`|AA11096223	It seems you have quite a lot of work ahead of you.  You are already a step ahead though - by getting professional help you have set yourself up for success.  My suggestion is to be realistic with your training goals.  Don't expect huge successes in a short amount of time.  As long as you are making progress and getting closer to what you want, you're doing fine.  It takes more than a month to create the finished horse you describe.    Remember that for a young horse, EVERYTHING is new!  A little nervousness is not unusual.  On a realistic note, however, you cannot train a horse to be truly bombproof.  With training, she will improve, will not spook as easily, and most importantly, should be controllable when she does get nervous.     Be sure to be clear with your trainer about your goals, and if you don't feel like you are getting closer to them, discuss your feelings with them.  Communication is very important between the two of you.  Be honest with yourself too, you know your limitations and if it turns out that she is not the horse for you, that's not your fault.  Your safety is the number one priority.    Training a horse can be a very rewarding and eye-opening experience.  They often teach us more than we teach them.  Good luck to you.|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	CLINTON ANDERSON!!!    www.downunderhorsemanship.com     DO NOT GIVE UP, YOU CAN DO THIS...THERE IS HOPE!!!!!!!    I have a 2 yr old QH filly, almost 16 hands tall.

WEekT4b6aa	You have to talk to an animal behaviorist.   You also need to learn how to be pack leader.  If you were, your dog would not be so vicious.  cw|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Taking her to a trainer might help but probably a behaviorist would be better.  I have seen many nasty lil dogs, it isn't uncommon at all. It might be a better idea to have her groomed by a very experienced groomer either mobile or at a shop but straight thru with valium instead of heavily sedating her. She wouldn't have to sit in a cage & if done on mobile would be at home which is reassuring to most dogs even in the van.  Good luck!|`|vPde97E2aa	Who's fault is it that the monster is untrained,ill-mannered & spoiled rotten?  Hint=it's NOT the dog!

Late Entry : glad you still find it so amusing, you moron!!!!!|`|yjT6ToTCaa	You should see behaviorist. I am not sure a trainer unless they are use to this kind of problem will be able to help you. You need the dog whisperer, and a muzzle.|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	I am a dog psychologist and behavior therapist and you need one of us to come and spend and hour or two with you and your dog to work with you and train both of you in how to stop and prevent this behavior.  They will also be able to assess you and your current energy and leadership of the dog and correct that, retraining you to become and effective and consistent leader so that the dog does not even question your authority. When a dog has strong leadership, it will not exhibit behaviors like this.    Your dog needs to learn that even a bite will not make you back off. When you have stripped her of all her methods of attack, there's nothing she can do but surrender to you, but ALWAYS get a professional in to do this for you. Even with dogs like this, there is no place for punishment, just learning. Your dog needs to learn that biting will not get the desired effect and that grooming is an acceptable and enjoyable experience.    You need to find a behavior/rehab specialist that will not only see you in your home, but go to a groomers with you as well so that you all learn how to deal with and overcome this behavior. There are groomers that know how to deal with this, but it is more important that you learn for the sake of your dog, you and anyone else that has contact with her.    Good luck.|`|2ofzcrdGaa	You should never have to sedate your dog to groom her this is dangerous for her. I am a groomer and i specilize in hard to groom and elder dogs. To start out i can tell you, you are the one to blame for this poor dogs temperment, people let there dogs get away with murder and then bring it to the grooming shop, and most likely the groomer is not a professional that does not know what they are doing. I have groomed lots of difficult dogs and never had to sedate them. I do think taking her to a professional trainer, not petsmart a real professional

All of this can easily run about $1000 and where, young lady, are you going ot come up with all that money.  Also have you thought of what you will do if you and your mom have to take a trip, boarding a dog can cost about $100 unless you have a responsible adult that can come and let the dog out and feed him or her.  There are lots of things that you must think about before you decide "oh I think it will be cool to have a cute doggy" they are a lot of responsibility and are as needy as a small child.  Since you also don't seem to have a driver's license who is going to have to use their gas to get the dog to the vet (since the only way a dog can go on a city bus is if it were a service dog such as seeing eye dog for the blind), your mom is of course and have you thought if she works, that she may have to take off work early thus losing pay, to take the dog to the vet for you.  So consider all of this things before you decide you want a dog.  No I'm not going to tell you how convince your mom to adopt a dog because you have to look at it from her stand point.|`|cwwbIWtQaa	Don't tell her. That won't convince her. You have to show her. Get a job, get good grades, do extra shores without being asked, clean your room, etc.|`|X0kqaRRaaa	Why don't you start off with maybe a stuffed animal, treating it as though it were a real puppy or dog. Feed it regularly, take it out on time  regularly,act like you're cleaning up accidents and disciplining the puppy;  take it for walks (maybe in your back yard where the neighbors won't think you're loony). What ever you would do for a real dog do it for this stuffed dog. Try it and see if she would change her mind.   If you just forget your stuffed dog in the room all day, I would say "NO", don't get one yet. But, if you provide everything for it, maybe she will change her mind. Give it a chance.  I let my son get one when he showed me he could take care of a "stuffed animal".|`|TM7o75ODaa	Show her you're responsible. Try doing your chores before she asks you to or even doing chores you wouldn't normally do. Look up local dog shelters in your area and do research about the breed of dog you want and the extra responsibilities that would come along with a specific breed. For instance, some dogs require more grooming than others. Get all the information you can. It can only help you. You could also try bringing your grades up in school. You know that B you have in math? Bring it up to an A. Show your mom you're more responsible than she thinks you are and maybe you'll get her convinced. Good luck!|`|BE6v12pmaa	The best you could do to make her believe you are a responsible individual is stop telling her. SHOW HER instead in some other ways!!!!|`|TpOVmqpHaa	Tell her?? Actions speak louder than words, hon.
AA11865682	Not at all.    My older cat has always "talked" to me, but when we got Oscar, he barely said anything until about a year old. I just assumed he was more independant but now I can't shut him up. Sometimes they are very talkative, sometimes not so much. Every cat is different and you may find he will begin to talk when he's ready.|`|uxq33y1maa	I don't think so. Cats have different personalities just like people. Our cat of 8 years rarely meows, either. Some are just talkers and others are quiet.|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	no no worries... just try and find a spot where your cat likes to sit down and sit down with him. he'll talk sooner or later. dont worry, my cat's the same...|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Not at all.  Every cat had their own personality.  Some cats seem determined to comment on everything. My oldest cat, age 14 years, usually 'mouths' a meow, as she is essentially mute.  Cats can go through stages.|`|6Ow34Lokaa	My big male cat, Skid, never shuts up. He talks, yaps, meows, growls and makes noise for no reason. He likes his own voice. Nothing I can do about that. His daughter, Little Gray Bastid (her name), never makes a sound. She stares for hours and never says a thing. Nothing I can do about that. Cats is cats, they do what they do. Some talk, some don't.|`|shRzfEHuaa	My last cat talked alot, and was loud. She passed away and i got a new kitten.  The new kitten didn't even meow the first week i had her, and when she did it was very faint.  I talked to the vet, and I was told that cats are like people, some have loud voices and talk alot, others are quieter and talk less often.  I got a second kitten and he talks to me all the time.  If your still really worried, i would just ask the vet next time you take the kitten in.  I wouldn't make an appointment just for that.|`|AA10387399	No not at all. Some cats are born talkers. They want to tell you about everything that happens. Some cats rarely say anything unless they want something like food or treats. No two cats are ever just a like.|`|AA11763491	Not at all, my 7 month old meows like mad because he had so many cats around him when he was born. My other cat was taken pretty young and she only meows when she is annoyed or mad or really really wants attention. My first ever cat had to learn to meow from my stepfather, so he meows all weird. The second cat we had said, "mom" and doesn't really meow at all, because he heard me and my sisters saying mom (no lie). I would suggest that you just wait it out, if they want to meow, they will. If you keep the cats around each other, if the other one meows enough, the other will catch on. It is really like infant children, they learn to talk by hearing people talk to them, cats are the same way, that is why each cat can have a significantly different meow from others. If they are acting weird however, like apathetic, not movin too much then I would suggest worrying, but if they haven't meowed yet it is probably because it is unlearned, or he just doesn't feel like it yet. My smallest cat barely meowed when we got him, I thought there was something wrong, now he talks to me for like 20 minutes at a time, NONSTOP.|`|5a2w82vGaa	As everyone else has said, some cats simply do not talk. Our puss of eighteen years meowed for the very first time at the tender age of fourteen. Yet he was a perfectly happy, healthy cat. There's no need for concern.|`|xfHearRDaa	haha no that i sooo normal. for one thing the new cat might just not be a meower. all cats have there own special little personality. like a snow flake no cat is like the other.|`|HwujORd2aa	When we brought the younger one into the house, she was stone silent.  Then, she saw how much we liked it when the first one talked to us and that we'd talk back.  Then the younger one wouldn't shut up and the older one was rarely heard from.  Then it changed around again. Just kitty personalities playing out.  Just wait til the younger one is at least as big as the older one!  You'll get to see I'm the Alpha Cat playing itself out over and over through the years.  It's funny!

rApLHbmWaa	she is probably in heat. keep her away from bigger dogs.  It is also not too late to have her fixed. Dogs can come into heat every 6-12 months.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	She is probably in heat.Keep her indoors and only take her out to the  bathroom on a leash and stay with her.She will be in heat for roughly three weeks,and during the second week,she will bleed.It is after she is finished bleeding that she will be most attractive to male dogs,so really watch her then.And when she is out of heat,have her spayed!|`|dlpAxkfQaa	take it to the vet ASAP if she isnt barking then wait until tommorow to take her unless call the animal hospital and see if their open and run!

ul1P1qAQaa	It could be. I've recently just learned of this other condition as well, it's usually in big dogs, but it is a paralysis of the throat muscles... comes with old age.. and it causes these sorts of issues along with snoring and reduced amount of physical activity ability because they can't pant efficiently. I don't remember what it's called. You could check into that. Maybe get a second opinion from a different vet.|`|jPoSQ3Kzaa	Because he is vomitting in the morning, it sounds like his stomach gets acidic overnite because he is not eating and it is empty. I had this problem with my bullmastiff and the vet advised that every other night I should put a pepcid ac in his food. It helped tremendously. I would think you may want to check on the dosage for the little yorkie but would highly recomend trying it. I bought a couple bottles at BJs and it was a very inexpensive fix.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	He is probably throwing up because his stomach is empty.  I am assuming that he is vomitting frothy bile or clear liquid??    This is pretty common if the dog is used to being fed at set times.  Some people vary the feeding times to prevent this from happening and other just make sure the dog is fed on time.|`|j9axB0YMaa	If it's just puking up yellow liquid then yes it'd from heartburn. My dog does it from time to time but if he was doing it every morning I would take him to the vet.|`|S9B8Fr4daa	I have 2 that do this..  I avoid this by feeding an hour later than I used to.  For some reason--Mine throw up if they eat too early. Then I have big piles of puke to clean up--NOT fun.
0e51HkpHaa	They will all get along fine, the only reason to separate them would be to get purebred chicks. Boy (rooster) Delaware + Girl (hen) Delaware = purebred Delaware chick.|`|d10wjRifaa	I am not sure about the breed but when they are in tight places like a cage some breeds will fight, I have seen this in pet shops one breed is bigger than the other and end up picking on it, I have seen and from my experience when they have more room like a yard they will get along since there is enough room for them to roam, but i don't know you, I suggest you start of with two of different breeds and see how they get along if one start picking on the other one separated them but if they get along add more chickens supervising them if all is good no fighting nothing its ok. Youll also notice when a chicken is being bullied its feathers from its head will be all pluck out, remove the chicken.|`|8GDd6lrnaa	heavy breeds don't fight as much. if you have a lot of roosters, separate them so you can feed up for butcher. and keep a rooster if you want fertile  eggs. some people prefer them to eat also. best eggs come from chickens that can pasture. get a poultry drench to put in their water when you get them it will help keep your losses down. good luck.

fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	Unless you are planning on putting her into training with a professional trainer then no, I would get a horse that's already been ridden.  It is very time consuming to train a horse and it's hard work.  It's important groundwork is done correctly and the the first time under saddle is done right.  I've been training/riding for 14 years and even i'm struggling with training my 3 year old.  Trust me, if you want to go out there and have run riding.. get a broke horse.  With only 4 years experience under you belt, like I said, unless you are planning on putting her into professional training.. don't buy her.|`|j2yLjm6Naa	If you think you have the time and money to tackle the challenge of training a horse and you have the time for it I would say GO ON AHEAD  but if you don't have the time don't waste the money.

sbB0TpGXaa	At least a 50% chance at grey    The grey may or may not fall on top the following colors.  The percentage chances of these depend on the exact genetics of the stallion, which can not be told from your description.    palomino  chestnut  black   smokey black    there is a small chance the palomino could hide the agouti gene and you could get a bay or buckskin if so.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	What color are the stallion's parents?  I know exactly how to find out but first I must know his parents' colors.  It depends on if he is homozygous (has 2 copies of the grey gene) or heterozygous (1 copy) because grey is dominant.    If both of the stud's parents are grey, then the baby will be grey most likely.    It has a 25% chance palomino, 25% chance chestnut, and 50% chance grey if the parents of the stallion weren't both grey.    Palomino is just a chestnut horse with the creme dilution gene.  This has nothing to do with your foal, but the creme gene just changes the base color of a horse.  A bay horse with one copy of the creme gene turns buckskin, and with two copies it will turn perlino.  A chestnut with one copy of the creme gene turns palomino, and with two copies it turns cremello... this is just a response to the person who posted below me.|`|c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	If the mare is palomino then she is carrying two red genes (chestnut, and her sire would not have been brown, he would have been chestnut) plus the creme gene so she is going to throw a red gene and she has a 50% chance of throwing the creme gene.  The creme gene dilutes chestnut to palomino and bay to buckskin.      Gray horses are always born a color other than gray, usually almost black.  They gray with age, sometimes a lot within the first year and sometimes very slowly over time.   Gray is dominant over EVERY other color.  You will have a 50% chance of the sire throwing a gray gene if he's heterozygous, which he probably is.  If he does happen to be homozygous then the foal will be gray, 100%.  So you know you are going to have at least a 50% chance of getting gray regardless of any other genes going on there.     Since the mare's red genes are recessive, you really would need to know the sire's background to be able to guess accurately at all on this cross.  If you happen to get a palomino foal, because palomino is such a light color, it's going to be hard to see the faint gray hairs around it's eyes (and sometimes you can see sort of a grayish undercoat)  that are the tell-tale signs that a foal will turn gray.      If it's going to be a registered horse: If it's going to be gray then it needs to be registered as gray, no matter what color it is at birth.  There are a lot of gray horses out there that are misregistered as either a roan or whatever base color it was born with.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	Hi,           I have only minimal genetics knowledge. I am pretty sure though that palomino is a recessive gene and the more dominant traits of chestnut in the foals blood lines are likely to determine the coat color.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	You don't own a stallion, do you?  I'm hoping not ;)  Just the age.  Nothing against you!  Well, it depends on the bloodlines.  It depends what other colors are back in the bloodlines, because a family of horses that could all have brown eyes but one on mom's side and one on dad's side, could still have a blue eyed foal, depending on what comes up in the genes.  The dominant gene will take control of the ressesive!  I wasn't much of a help.
jvIVWgVnaa	In my experience with mastiffs, they're pretty lazy.  I wouldn't worry too much about fence jumping right off the bat.   1 it's cold and they don't want to be outside long.   2 he's in a new place and isn't done exploring yet.  But I haven't known a mastiff to jump a fence unless they had a dang good reason.  lol  Not saying he never will...but you have a better chance with them than a lot of other breeds.      As for your other dogs...  my mastiff LOVED small dogs.  I really wouldn't worry about it tooooo much.  They will warm up to him and him to them in time.  Just give them a lot of supervised time together and make sure you pay attention to how they react.  Eventually he'll be drooling all over their poor little heads.      Is he crate trained?  Due to his age and size, I wouldn't leave him unattended with your other dogs until you know for sure that they are 100% ok together.  It's unlike a mastiff to attack..but you just never know.    As for keeping him off the furniture.  IF you don't mind hair all over the place, it's actually a good idea to let them up there.  They're very, very heavy and they need something to relieve the pressure off of their bones and joints just like we do.    Now on to food.  Mastiffs and many other large dogs have a tendancy to develop "bloat".  One way of reducing this is by keeping food and fresh water out at all times and letting them regulate their own diet.  You don't want him to get fat obviously.  But usually dogs are pretty good about maintaining a healthy weight.  I hear of more dogs that are fed so many cups at this time and this time and this time each day being overweight than free fed dogs.    I guess the last thing is enjoy!  I had to put my girl down in october due to bone cancer.  I miss her SO much.  Have fun with your new baby!|`|naVUguuHaa	Okay. The small dogs are probably terriotoral. It was THEIR house first, you know? Then you bring a gianormus dog in and they get freaked. Maybe try to introduce them on neutral ground? Outside? You know.    Haha, feel free to let him on the couch. If you don't mind having a 120+ dog taking up the sofa, go for it. Otherwise, just get him a big dog bed and he should be okay.     As for feeding, just feed him twice a day; morning and evening. If he eats all his morning food, don't feed him until later. If he seems like he's still hungry, give him more food in the morning. You don't want to OVER feed him, you know?      Hope I was of help.|`|1868dc03c33039f8ae0fe4351eda6159aa	I wouldn't worry about the 2 little dogs, they will get used to each other.  Depending on how "small" the other 2 dogs are, Mack is probably a monster to them.  Have Mack lie on the ground and sit down next to him, offer the other 2 dogs treats if they come to you to get them.  Give Mack one once and awhile too!  They only get the treats if they are quiet and behave.  After a while, the little 2 will probably be sleeping on him!    4' fence - I really doubt he will try to jump it, although I'm sure he could if he tried.  Mastiffs don't usually want to work that hard.  He's also more likely to NOT try to get out if he is neutered.  Do not let him put his front feet up on the fence either.  This may seem cute when you are standing there talking to someone, but it is a bad habit to start.      Keep him off of the furniture entirely.  He's 120  and he'll probably fill out a little bit more.  It is better for him to stay on the ground...and, no, you won't hurt his feelings if the little dogs are on the couch.      Do NOT free feed.  Feed him twice a day - morning and night.  Feed a high quality kibble that is made for large breed dogs.  Follow the feeding guidelines on the back of the bag.  Do not let him eat the little dogs' food.  If he doesn't eat his own food within 10-15 minutes, pick it up and put it away.  Offer it again at the next feeding.      Good luck!|`|8eSbCrQraa	1.  The proper term is mastiff, but you will run into most people saying "oh, a bullmastiff!"  That is always what happens to us.  So I default to saying she's an english mastiff to avoid the whole thing.    2. Im not surprised he's timid of the new dogs.  Mastiffs can be quite shy so the new dogs are going to be a bit confusing for him.  I definitely would not leave all 3 dogs alone without knowing how they do.  Our puppy is an angel and then we brought home another 1 and she shows serious guarding of toys, food, water, etc.  If your other 2 are always out, block off the mastiff in a seperate room so he can adjust slowly.  New dogs in his face is too much for him now. Speaking of...    3.  On that note, the newest dogs to the house are the lowest on the totem pole.  So its good if he's blocked off so the new dogs feel less threatened and he isnt in a new environment, with new dogs, left unsure how to act and what to do.    4.  For acceptance, they have to feel they are high in pack order.  Let them out first, give them attention first, they get their bowls put down first.  They are above him.  It is ok, your dog will not be upset, he will simply learn his place.    5.  Highly doubt he'd jump the fence... if he does you have the most athletic mastiff, ever. lol    6.  We allow ours on the couch.  They really just love people and we have found ours settles down easier and loves laying with us.  Our bed is off limits.  I feel that is our space.  They have their space (crate) and we have ours.    7. Food- Im going to say certain times for now and then you pick up the bowl when he walks away.  Originally, our puppy had food out and she ate as she pleased without gaining weight.  However, ever since we introduced a new dog, she has CHOWED her food.  It is somewhat of a competition thing to make sure the other dog doesnt get it.  It could possible get your other dogs upset too with another dog and food laying around.  I would just feed at certain times and when they are done (walk away), its picked up.    Good luck!|`|5af8PNwxaa	Hi.  Firstly, I don't know much about Mastiffs.    However, I found these links on the internet site    http://www.buzzle.com/articles/taking-ca...    http://www.mastiffdogcenter.com/main/eng...    http://www.mastiff-care-secrets.com/the-...    My question here would be why did you decide to get a Mastiff (very large puppy) when you have a child and two very small dogs ?    Like all dogs, my concern here would be that I would be a little wary leaving my daughter or any child alone in the yard unsupervised, as Mastiffs have been known to bite kids, especially on the face.  Due to their size they could easily knock down you daughter..in fact you wife as well being such a powerful dog.   You have to be prepared yourself to take this dog on lots and I mean lots of walk / exercise.    My suggestion, for some professional feedback would be to speak to your local vet and get there opinion, they may even suggest 'puppy school' training.    Good luck.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Sit down with your mastiff in a room, and have someone bring in the other dogs on a leash. Immidiatly praise your mastiff and give him a treat after he looks at them. Repeat this a few more times. Do it ever so often if he is still timid. make those little dogs the "good guys"
7TQ5qGWcaa	Decide on the type of material you want. Your decision will be based on personal preference, use and budget. Nylon is cheap, strong and easy to care for, but is not suitable for competition. Synthetic leather has all the properties of nylon, but looks smarter. Real leather is by far the smartest and environmentally friendly, but is also the most experience and the hardest to care for.   Decide on the color of the bridle. Your decision will be based on personal preference, and your horse's color.   Decide on the weight of the material. This means the thickness of the material. Your decision will be based on personal preference, and your horse's conformation. A fine head will look better in fine material, while a more workman like head will look better in a thicker material.   Measure your horse's head. Bridles come in standard sizes, however horses don't so measuring them is important.   Measure for the headstall, from the corner of the mouth over the poll to the other corner of the mouth.   Measure for the throat latch around the poll and across the cheeks and 4 of your own fingers.   Measure for the brow band from just to the left of the left ear to just pass the right ear.   Measure for the nose band around the horse's nose 2 fingers below the protruding bone.   Choose a nose band that suits your horse. The nose band effects the action of the bit and the going of the horse and therefore should be chosen in conjunction with a bit. A nose band isn't always necessary and some horses are ridden without one, or with just a cavesson, which has minimal effect.   A crank cavesson has some effect to stop the horse opening his mouth or crossing his jaw. The cavesson and the crank cavesson are the only nose bands that should be worn with a double bridle.   Flash and drop nose bands have a greater effect at stopping the horse opening his month or crossing his jaw.   Grackle nose bands have a similar action to a flash, but work over a great area of the head and higher up.   Kineton nose band is a type of combination nose band that transfers some of the action of the bit to the nose.|`|an1L8njXaa	normaly english bridles come in 4 sizes pony, cob, full and extra full. general guide my 12.2hh and 13.2hh ponies who are quite fine are in pony sizes. My arab is in a cob size, my 14hh connemara is in a custom made bridle but its mostly cob size with some full size parts, My 16hh tb has a full size with a cob size nosband on it because he has a long narrow face. My 14hh traditional cob is in an extra full but she has a big head|`|L5X2Bx6Uaa	well it depends on the size of your horse. i don't think that you can actually measure your horses head. So you go under  the Sizes: Pony, Cob, Full, or Warmblood.  If you have  a small small pony = pony.  medium - large pony = Cob. large pony - medium horse = Full.  Large horse = Warmblood. And once you buy it there are straps to adjust for a good fit.  The halter size is the same size as the bridle.|`|T7QN2IzGaa	All of the sizes you mentioned are available but mostly I have run across pony, cob, horse, warmblood, arab, and draft sizes. Obviously if you don't have an arab, draft, pony, or warmblood your rule them out. Cob is for horses that are smaller than say your average quarter horse-- its very similar to arab sizes. In fact my friends arab wears a cob size in halter becuase its basically the same. You average 14.3-16 hand horse will wear a Horse or full or quarter horse size. Your best bet is just ask friends to try on their different size bridles. I have a 15.1 app and 16.1 quarter and they wear "horse".
jV7SmnaTaa	Ok...it all depends on you and your experience.    First, have you had unbroke horses before?  If you haven't trained a horse from the ground up before, this probably isn't the best one to start with.    I would be more concerned about when he was gelded verses his eye than anything!  He may act like a stallion since he was gelded late.  This may pose as a problem!    The eye may or may not be a problem.  If a horse is a quiet sensible horse then it typically doesn't pose too many problems.  However, if the horse is over reactive - then, the eye may create more problems.    Hope this helps...best wishes!|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	He seems nice, but if you have not had experiences training stallions, I wouldn't start out with a 4yr old half blind one. Even though he is gelded, if he had a foal, he had enough testoerone to act a stud, and he may not be calmed down as much as a normal gelding.    And even though he is blind on the left, you can still train and mount from the left. My mare lost her right eye due to cancer, and I still mount, tack up, and lead on both sides (I don't like the one sided things). As long as the horse is used to you and you take it slow, either side won't matter. I would show things to him on the right (such as the saddle) before bringing it to the left, so he has some idea what is going on.    The way I look at it with my mare? I ignore the fact that she is blind on one side and treat her exactly as I would a horse that could see on both sides. I always talk around my horses, so she knows where I am anyways.|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	I wouldn't. There are so many horses out there that have less issues! Typically if they have bred it is hard to get the stud out of them when your around mares.|`|RYRhMyh7aa	You would not have to do everything on the right side. I have worked with a few horses that are missing their left eyes. You just have to be a bit more patient with him. Make sure to give him plenty of space when riding him around other horses. They do have a tendency to spook easier. I have noticed that if they spook turn them and let them see what was scary for them.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	Definitely wouldn't have to do everything on the "good" side; as long as you build a relationship and trust with the animal.
lhOd2hvXaa	Why not attach the kennel run TO the garage with a doggie door so that he can come in from the cold when need be.  If he has the potential for going outside he's not likely to potty inside (if properly trained, of course).    The answer to your question is, of course, all relative depending on what you call cold.  My southern friends think that 40 degrees is horribly cold and I would worked outside today in those temps without a coat.  If the dog has a GOOD doghouse and it is insulated with fresh bedding (changed on a regular basis) then he can withstand the cold (not below freezing) temperatures.    Good Luck!|`|KeT55QP4aa	dogs can get cold very esealy depending on there hair. dogs can esealy freeze to death out side in this cold weather right now
q0vKbocHaa	sick- lid|`|cJPOs7Tsaa	What they said....|`|Jtd7kXQSaa	sick-lid|`|OsWTsB9Xaa	you pronounce it sick-lid. does that help?|`|AA11708471	Sick-Lid|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	"SICK-lid."    I've heard people say "Chick-lid," but that's not a fish, that's chewing gum.    Not that you asked, but the Siamese Fighting Fish's other name (Betta) is pronounced "BET-ah," not "BAY-tah." The second pronunciation is the name of the second letter of the Greek alphabet, but not of the fish from Thailand.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	Siklid

jV7SmnaTaa	Yes, many stables are willing to (and gladly accept) have people work off atleast part of their board.  Sounds like a great idea if you don't mind hard work and have the time to put in!    Best wishes!|`|RYRhMyh7aa	I don't see why that would be a problem. Alot of stable owners don't mind having the extra help. When I first got my horse I worked on the weekends to work off half of the board. It teaches you alot about responsibility that comes with taking care of a horse.|`|v2xUy1dXaa	yes thats exceptionally reasonable!!|`|u1HahCoqaa	Many people work to take off some of the cost of board. Its perfectly reasonable- although as always it depends on the barn.|`|gbd4PMwfaa	I do just what you are describing. I have my horse on pasture board though, so she only gets grain four times a week and i also work that off. I also don't have a job currently as I am still in high school and in the summer my parents drop me off in the morning and don't come pick me up till lunch time or later and so after I ride I work, and ride other horses for the barn owner. She doesn't have many lesson kids so some of those horses have to get ridden and there are some boarders who never show up whose horses she lets me ride. But since I have school now I clean stalls every saturday and ride a horse in training to be a lesson horse every sunday for fifty dollars off board and grain. I think this is a great way to thank my parents for getting a horse for me and it also shows how responsible i am. Good Luck. Sorry this is so long. Hope it helps.|`|AA11027121	If you worked out a rate and were there then yeah it might be possible.  But that is a big commitment on your part and you need to understand that the owner will depend on you being there.  I do not know where you are but where I live minimum wage is around $8 so to get $50 off you would need to only put in 6-7 hours if that is the rate the stable owner agreed upon.  You really need to work it out with them.  A lot of stables do have student workers that help out so I would look into it|`|FLBCvJuDaa	I would allow something like that at my barn.|`|zPpgohF9aa	Great idea!!!    When I boarded years ago , I managed a 32 horse stable and even lived there along with my two horses for free plus held down a full time job , trained and did farrier work.    However , in your case,   getting just your board free , if even for doing stall cleaning is a pretty fair trade for BOTH parties.  People who are willing,  consistant  and with good work ethic for this sort of thing are extremely HARD to find!  Lol,  it also builds loads of charactor!  Would be welcome in my barn!

N2jvxYPcaa	I agree with your poster who mentioned the 101 Arena excercises by Cherry Hill. But I have another book that will sound a bit weird at first, but also is full of super ideas. And that is 101 Jumping Excercises by Linda Allen. The basic simple excercises are perfect for all horses, not just jumping horses. They use ground poles, but at the most simple levels you do figure 8s through two poles, and weave around them, and then slowly start to do walk over and trot overs. I find these excercises really help my rail horses because the excercises keep them thinking. You might work over three rails set up in a line, but it won't be what the horse expects - you will trot over one, then make a small circle and trot over the next, make a small circle the opposite direction and trot over the third, etc. Also, we now know that all that work on ground poles helps a horse lift their backs and move better.  I am also a big believer in doing as much work as possible out of the ring. You can do alot of trail riding and still do alot of training, and its much better for your horse's mind. I let my horse move on a loose rein often when trail riding, but I will pick areas and do haunches in as we travel down the path. Then I will stop and do pivots. Then we will go on a loose rein for 15 minutes, and then we will do work up and down a hill. Your horse will get much better toned (do alot of long trotting, even for a Western horse) and your horse won't dread all the ring work. If you have limited places to ride, buy some hoof boots so you can ride on the road.  Also, teach your horse to pony other horses, and pony her at times, too. I agree that starting English is super for them, and I would try to work on as many other classes as possible, even if you don't plan to ever enter those classes. Set up trail obstacles, and work on bridges and back-throughs, and lope overs. And work on them properly, where you stop in the middle of the back-through and camp, so your horse learns to never anticipate. When you work on trail obstacles you should spend as much time standing and resting as you do working. Also, work on the Western riding pattern, even if its just at the trot. Trot through barrel patterns. Trot through pole bending patterns. Just keep finding new things to do, and it will help mentally and physically. But most of all, try to get out of the ring several times a week. Both you and your horse will enjoy it and benefit.|`|hEXb1unraa	I totally agree with PG here as i do about 65 to 70% of my training out on the trails and 30% solid ring work once ground work is done;. I also go back to long lining once a week as you can do sooo much with a pair of lines......i also like to introduce trail obstacles as in bridges, gates, ground poles, water pretty much anything that gets my horses mind working and thinking.|`|nh0QSyeiaa	There is a spiral bound arena guide that is awesome.  It is called 101 arena excercises.  And, it has TONS of great ideas!|`|SFfE6dOfaa	i  do lots of different exercises with my western pleasure horse. Some i do are:    1. side passing, pivoting, and leg yielding at trot  2. serpentine through cones  3. lope ground poles (straight line, pinwheel, fish pattern, etc)  4. back throughs (set up 3 cones in a triangle and back in a curve in between them (like serpentine), or make an L with poles and back through that)  5. extended trot and extended lope  6. patterns  7. bareback (helps you feel how horse moves)  8. briddleless (with a lead rope around horse's neck)    Another thing i suggest is trying some different things. Like try reining or barrel racing or jumping or dressage or english pleasure or cutting or something else as well. I show all around with my horses because i find they get bored if you just do one discipline. yes you can have a main one, one that you concentrate more on or that might be the only one you show, but by ridding different disciplines, you mix things up and you are always doing something different and you and your horse don't get bored! good luck!|`|AA11746317	well, you can throw stuff at her and that gets her warmed up!
0vb7eV4yaa	You say you have 11 years of riding experience so I would expect you to have a good idea of who you are and what you want.    Start by figuring out your goals. Use that as the basis for your decision. Breeds are developed to do a specific job. Figure out what you want to do and find out which breed or breeds were developed to do that job. Figure out your budget and look for a horse in your price range that matches your level. Don't be afraid to look outside the breeds you are interested in if you find an individual that catches your eye for other reasons. If that should happen, keep in mind the job that breed does and ask if the individual you are looking at will be able to physically and/or mentally do the job or jobs you might ask.    The smoothness of gait is a combination of confirmation and training. Unless you are looking for an easy gait, gait is something that you check in an individual. With a few exeptions, breed is not going to tell you too much.    Some general horse buying advice:    -Don't buy the prettiest horse you find. They are rarely the best.    -Remember, you are buying an individual, not a breed. See each horse as an individual with good points and bad points. You are looking for the one where the good points outway the bad points.    -NEVER buy a horse you feel sorry for. Pity will turn to frustration, anger and disappointment. Your horse will never understand your pity. Many times that pity is triggered by problems you are most likely unqualified to address properly. Your pity could end up hurting the horse (or you) more in the end.    I would think as a 13 year old, you will probably be looking for a generalist. I personally love the mountian horses. TWH and MFT are of the same line and have similar personalities. Quarter horses are good generalists as well. So are Morgans. I hate to anger the paint lovers out there but most of the paints I've met have been pretty flighty so they are not my first pick.    In the end, regardless of all your plans and planning and if you are very lucky, the horse will pick you and you will know.    Good luck!|`|c2ae5f615f25531189e8ff6d3f5d6150aa	While it's very true that any breed can be good or bad, usually Quarter Horses, Appaloosa's (if something else is behind them, make sure it's mostly Quarter Horse), and Paints (they are usually crossed with Quarter Horses) are some of the best natured light horse breeds.  POA's are also a really nice little horse (although classified as a pony) for kids your age and take a lot longer to outgrow, if you ever outgrow it at all, like most ponies.  I haven't been around many Morgans, but I think they tend to be good horses, too.  I would stress that you stay away from Thoroughbreds and Arabians.  Some Arabians are great, but as a rule they tend to be pretty high-strung, although a half-Arab might be okay if crossed on a stock horse type (like a Quarter Horse).  Thoroughbred's are usally way too much horse for someone your age.  The advise someone gave you about getting an older horse is very important!  They tend to be a lot more mellow and settled than younger ones who haven't seen it all and done it all yet.|`|vow5ULxTaa	I own 3 TWH's and they are great.  My favorite of my bunch is Delight's Midnight Lightning "Lightning" He is a versatility horse meaning he can cow pen then turn around and do a dressage routine.  He also does barells, jumping, flat work, etc.  I love walkers because they are so calm.  Lightning especially is very calm he loves to work and is very responive to cues.  He will stand very still and then when you go to ride him will not be a lazy pluggy horse but has lots of "controlable energy"  Also the TWH is gaited so they don't trot but do a Running walk which is a saddle gait meaning you don't post to it.      go for TWH's there the best.  If you don't get that then a nice Quarter horse there great first horses.    * i got my first horse at 13 he was a arabian which i would not suggest as a first horse unless you are a good rider and can ride a high spirited horse. (He bucked me off in my first year of owning him breaking my sacrum and hairling fracturing my hip)|`|q0vKbocHaa	I'm not a big horse peroson, but doesn't gait really depend on the horse itself? Same with personality any horse can be a "nippy" horse|`|vaulPrAmaa	yes, tenesses are good, but it's more the horse than the breed.  Generally, thoroughs are high strung arabs moody, clydes gentle, but its the horse that you want to look for, not the breed.  I had my heart set on an arabian, and when I finally got a horse, it was a welsh cross.  She is perfect, and I wouldn't trade her for the world.  When I was about 10, I made my own owners manual.  One section I made was about what kind of characteristics I wanted  my horse to have. (ie. temperment, size, age) and I surfed the online stores to see what kinds of horses had those characteristics.  Take your time, and when looking for a horse, look for bad habits as well.  (including cribbing, property boundness, biting, leaning, and other riding bad habits)    Good luck with getting a horse!      I just read the answer above mine - s/he's right.....I got a 2 yr old - at times it seems there's no end in sight!  I wouldn't trade my 2 yrs with her for anything...and we've been through a lot.  bucking, rearing, kicking, striking, throwing, biting, running away, getting loose and not coming back (countless times).  It takes realy responsability for any horse, but especially a young one.  Opal was the right horse for me, and im not saying a young one wouldn't be for you - just know what your getting into, and don't take on too much.  The horse would be better off left alone in the first place then abandoned because the owner couldn't handle it.  No matter what, stick with your decision.  It will be hard - harder than you can imagine.  But sitting on the ground after being bucked off and thinking I broke a rib and both wrists and sitting there crying - no one there, people screaming and running to help me - I knew that that was my horse that did that, and that I don't care.  I love her, and I always will.  She could kill me before I lay a hand on her (apart from minor training =P)|`|8Y4LUH3zaa	Wow must be nice to get your own horse. I couldnt get a horse until i could pay for it myself. After all it is the riders responsibility Anyway., I would say a Quarter Horse. They are the most laid back, and i think they have a better personality for a kid your age.|`|x84d9yInaa	PAINT!!!! They're the best! I have two!|`|XfP895zXaa	a riding pony or a stockhorse. morgans are supposed to be good first horses. find a horse you feel comfortable with don't just get the first you see|`|Wvg9xCWHaa	honestly, i don't know about your experience or your level with horses. but i have found that percheron's have REALLY nice gaits and have great personality's and they aren't really spookish. But they of course are draft horses so they range between 16-18 hh, which can be a little over whelming for a first horse, but i have a friend who's your age but she's kinda tall but she has the sweetest percheron mare. :)  i also find that bashkir curlies, qh's, and arabians are really great!    also, no matter how long you have been riding, DO NOT get a foal!!!! i can't stress that enough, get a horse between 8 and 15, that way they are better trained and will except your mistakes, which you WILL make many no matter how long you have been around horses, just because it is your first!|`|4TeTxXYOaa	I like quarter horses, they're generally sweet and easy to get along with. I also like the fact of how fast they go|`|rZPmo1Wzaa	you can't label a horse's gait and temperment by their breed. i own 2 high-strung horses (and arab and a thoroughbred) and they have awesome gaits. i also own a quarter horse and a quarter horse/arab/appaloosa cross. out of the 4 of them- the TB has the nicest gaits (but he's definately very high-maintenence and touchy otherwise) the QH has the best personality and manners, the QH/arab/appy cross is very defiant but an easy keeper and the arab is the cutest, with good gaits, but has trust issues.  if you know enough about horses (which im guessing you do- 11 years!) i'd go for either a paint, arab, or TB if you can handle that kind of thing, if you just want something easygoing that rides well i'd try a morgan or maybe a paint cross.   i've ridden so many horses that i know you can't really label a horse solely by it's breed, and i never buy a horse without test riding it at least twice. you really just have to look around and find out what horses are for sale in your area and then find out more about them. its a long process, but well worth it when you find that one awesome horse!!|`|qW0tq6A2aa	QUARTER HORSE!!!!    they tend to always have a GREAT mind which will definitely build your confidence. they are great all-around horses and that's exactly what the breed is known to be... an all-around horse... they are known to do just about everything. they are SOOO quiet and so sweet and i personally think that they are just beautiful. they'd be great for trails, jumping, flatwork, barreling, pole bending, etc.    definitely dont get a pony because you will grow out of it very soon.    i have two quarter horses and i have ridden warmbloods, thoroughbreds, ponies, crosses, etc. and by far quarter horses i have found to have the best minds. they are like big puppy dogs that will be able to take care of you. my first horse was a quarter horse and he has taken me SO far... and btw dont let anybody try to tell you that they dont jump... because i have heard that SO many times and have yet to see quarter horses refuse any more than any other horse.... both of mine jump 3' 6'' and the one is a jumper!    I LOVE THEM and i highly recommend them for a first horse.... they are pretty fancy too!    also, if you see a thoroughbred cross with a quarter horse... make sure its got the quarter horse mind and not the thoroughbred..    you should test ride each horse and have a vet check for each one you are interested in before you buy it... because they are a HUGE expense and you dont want to go wrong    finally, breeds can say a lot about a horse but arent everything so you may find another breed of horse and it could end up being great for you! or you could find a horse that is a quarter horse and he might not be the best either.... but good luck!

It only took him a week or so.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Okay, I have had many rodents, and what works and has always worked for me was by wearing a thick sock on my hand as a glove and taken out whatever rodent, in this case a dwarf hamster and placing it into you hand with the thick sock on.     They of course are scared but make a somewhat firm grip and first start by petting their head, over and over, then touching their little paws, etc. Within three days they get use to the sock and you petting them, then in about seven days remove the sock and they'll still try to nibble your hand but not bite.     Best of luck! I swear, this has worked for me with all rodents I have had.|`|aERd9Se2aa	in my own experience you can train them to be friendly with your hand and be familiar with it not biting not squeaking in your hand..this is what you can do:    1. 1st you should know what's their favorite food..example:my hamster's favorite food is sunflower seeds..    2. don't always feed your hamster with their favorite food so they could be always liking it..    3. try putting their favorite food in your hand and just put some of the bedding in your hand too..    4. so the hamster will come to your hand and eat that food.. when its already in a good position just raise your hand up slowly so that it wouldn't mind it..    5. just do it twice or once a day then your hamster will just get used to it and it will just come to your hand every time you put your hand in the cage..    hope it helps.. mine is very loyal right now.. but i have 2 hamster that i want to breed and this is the 2nd time she gave birth last time it was 2 now it was 9 weee....
dfb64b243bd35b4224dd85cc89895d3daa	Removing the algae by scrubbing is a good method, or soaking it in warm salt water will help too, as the algae will not survive in saltwater.  However, please be reminded to wash the plastic plants carefully before use.    Suggestions:  To keep algae from growing:    a) Water  Algae mostly grow because your water is rich with nutrients (e.g.: feces & waste of fishes) and there too much sunlight, so if you do weekly water changes and reduce sunlight or bulb lights, this will certainly help.    b) Biological solutions  get an algae eater or plec, these guys will help to eliminate most of the algae.    c) Chemical solutions  Go to your local pet stores or even order them online. There are some products that will keep your aquarium algae-free. It is a bit expensive, well, nothing comes cheap...    Good luck!|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	I've heard of people putting plastic aquarium plants in the top rack of the dishwasher and running the dishwasher (without the dish detergent). I haven't tried it, but it's said to work well. I would skip the "dry" (heat) cycle if I were to try this.    How do you keep the algae from growing back? Except for keeping the aquarium in total darkness (which would make it really hard for you to see your fish), I don't think you can.|`|YIvIVvWFaa	You can soak them in chlorine bleach, but as the chlorine is lethal for fish, after rinsing the plants well, soak them again in a solution of plain vinegar and water. It doesn't take a lot of vinegar to neutralize the chlorine. You will be able to tell because the smell will change. After that, rinse well again and you're set to go. I got this hint from someone working at the place where I bought my fish, and although I was scared to do it at first, it never harmed them.    The algae are bound to grow back, but once you get the hang of this easy method, you won't care so much. I was going crazy when all I knew to do was scrub the algae away.|`|beE1nFA6aa	You can't keep the algae from growing back. No matter what you try, it will still come back eventually. It's just one of those things. Unless you completely elliminate the algae in your tank, it will come back.    To clean plastic plants, simply scrub it in hot tap water. That should suffice for pretty much every need.|`|6r66qqnxaa	Soak them in bleach water, brush it off and then RINSE,RINSE and then RINSE some more. If your water is healthy, there is no way they will not come back unless you get a suckerfish or something like that.
MGAmNxddaa	The Glider Chow I purchased when I bought mine,from Pocket pets .com.......is suppose to make them odor free.And I believe it.They are setting on a high table,2 ft from my sofa since August and we have not been tempted to kick them out yet.It's expensive,yet they told me this giant baggie would last me all year.I didn't see how,yet 5 months later,I still have over half left.Do not feed crickets or other live food,as this adds to the smell.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	That is impossible. all poop stinks, even yours. If you clean the cage regularly, you will get less of a smell. Their natural body odor smell is pretty distinct (I am not a fan of it, even though I am fine with ferret musk) but it is not something you will get rid of.       You should worry about feeding them a proper diet (dry food mixed with fruits, veggies, and insects) moreso than feeding them something that changes their smell.
4BBjhHAnaa	There is something called parthenogenesis.  It is when a female of a species gives birth without any contribution from a male.  It is most common in sharks and many invertebrates.    I have heard of something similar sometimes happening with rabbits.  Normally for mammals it does not result in live birth, but a miscarriage as the mother approaches full term.    A medical marvel, but not really a miracle.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	wow. Now that is a miracle lol. Maybe she had a sexual relationship with another hamster before you bought her, but I thinks he would have had babies earlier than that. Have you asked anyone in the house? And maybe a hamster has crept into your house? The best bet is waiting a few weeks caring for the hamsters then taking them all to the vets, ringing up the vets may also be a good idea. There is also the weird possibility that your hamster is a homaphridte (bad spelling I know) or maybe s/he was an Asexual its rather confusing really. Just make sure you care for your hamster and her babies and look up over the internet how to look after them or ring the vet. Maybe if you search over the internet you may find some similar stories.

LMflh3C4aa	There are lamps that have both in one.  They are called Mercury Vapor Bulbs.  Good ones are the Megaray line, the T-Rex Line, and the Powersun.    They definately need a light that produces UVB, so that they can synthesize D3 and in turn utilize calcium.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Both are necessary.    UV light provides nutrients needed for proper bone growth and maintenence.      Heat is needed because Dragons are cold blooded desert dwellers.  They like being on the warm side all the time.  You don't necessarily need a heat lamp, but you do need a heater.     So, you leave the UV light on at least 12 hours a day, and it also keeps the dragon warm.  You shut it off at night, and the heater keeps everything cozy.|`|NIPmV4uMaa	UV light is absolutely necessary. So is heat. There is a type of UV light called a MVB (mercury vapor bulb) that gives off heat and light, though these shouldn't be used in small enclosures; it will be too hot. Sadly, most MVBs will damage your beardies eyes, so you need to be careful about which brand you get. In fact, the only brand that has been proved safe is the MegaRay.  Great website about UV: http://www.uvguide.co.uk/    I'm so happy to hear that you're doing your research. Beardies have a lot of complicated needs and take a lot of care (I spend two hours a day caring for mine!). Keep up the research! The more you know, the healthier and happier both you and your beardie will be. They are great pets if you attend to all of their needs. Every minute of research and work is worth it!|`|2CbfO4jWaa	uv-b is NOT necessary when calcium and d-3 are provided in vitamin form and USE ABLE heat is provided.  in short uv-b bulbs are gimmick b.s.  what bearded dragons need is heat and LOTS of it. give your bearded dragon a nice 130F-150F basking spot, 80F-70F ambients and a GOOD vitamin supplement you will have a much healthier happy bearded dragon and more money in your pocket to buy use full things for your beardie then the other guy with his 100F-110F basking spot 80F-70F ambients and expensive uv lighting. try it for your self. ive kept and bred beardies in both manners and trust me uv lighting is a costly gimmick. but hey what do i know? im just a monitor guy.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	The UV or UVB light is essential. You are got to have it. Without it your dragons health will decrease and possible get metabolic bone disease. Your need a basking lamp for heat as the temps in one area need to be on an average of 105 degrees. You can use regular household light bulbs for this. Just get a really good digital probe thermometer to keep really accurate reading on the temps.  The are wonderful pets as I have 5 but you really need to do a lot of research as to what their needs are and food requirements.  There are some great places on the web for good information and the first that comes to mind is beardeddragon.org and another one is I think beautifuldragons. Just do a search and learn everything you can.
5QG9Zrjaaa	Dressage tests only change every 4 years, and then not all of them change, and sometimes not very much.    The 2007 tests are the current tests.  You can get them at USEA.org or you can print them off at http://www.dressage.net.au/index.html as that has all the tests already diagrammed out and it is easier to see what is happening and where you are going.|`|u1HahCoqaa	http://www.usdf.org/competitions/competi...

1AGT31Bcaa	1) Technically, yes; anything is "possible"... It's also possible to stuff as many various reptiles as you could fit in a box for their entire lives, but that doesn't mean you should. You could also put a large dog that hates cats and a large cat that hates dogs in the same, way-too-small carrier, but, again, would you?  To begin with, in the wild, the tortoises live in Russia and the boa lives in South America--no where NEAR each other, as well as EXTREMELY different climates. Because of this, their care is going to be dramatically different. Then, you have to factor in the fact that snakes view everything their size or smaller to be "food" and tortoises have claws and hard, sharp beaks (instead of teeth). You're asking for a lot of trouble and heartbreak throwing that combination together... You'd have the snake eating tortoises, and tortoises protecting themselves from the snake.    2) I guess I answered this above, but in case you're as thick as some people I've seen... NO. This is a horrible idea! Why would you risk all of their lives? Even if your boa's tank was the size of a large bedroom, I'd still advise against it. Snakes aren't social creatures to begin with, anyway.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	No, it is not good to do that.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	You only want serious answers, you should ask a serious question. No you cannot keep them together. It is a horrible idea. Most tortoises don't even live in the same environment as a red tail boa...|`|nI8G21y8aa	no. dont mix different animal species together|`|BX8rrBajaa	That is a loaded question.  Because the Internet cannot be trusted, I would advise you to call   The Aquatic Critter  615-832-4541 ext. 3 (The Reptile Room)  http://www.aquaticcritter.com/    I cannot even begin to tell you how many times they have helped me!|`|NIPmV4uMaa	Absolutely not. The only two reptile species that can be kept together without one eating or injuring the other is the crested gecko and the pink tongued skink. And even then, specifications apply.    Snakes do not mix with other animals. Even other snakes. Even other snakes of the same species may fight.
Km6gOd61aa	Your rats could be fighting with their tails without even realizing it. When you're out of the room they're in, they could also be fighting I would put bandage over the tails and bring them to a vet and ask what you should do.    If this continuously is happening put them in separate cages and if it's still happening they're probably hitting their tails against something in their cages like the wires and stuff. Make sure that they're tails can't get caught in anything in the cage because they could be pulling it out of a tight space which is causing their tails to get these abrasions|`|X1LlP5KPaa	The abrasions are probably from scuffling between your rats.  Do they fight often?    You also might want to check them for mites.  Take some tissue paper and rub them down with it and look at it very closely to see if you can see small black or red specks moving around.
paHjJrrdaa	Goldfish need 10 gallons each if you want them to reach their possible 30 year mark. You really shouldn't put anything else with them.  It's not healthy for the other fish to be with goldfish.  Goldfish pee ALOT and poop alot more than other fish.  This causes higher ammonia levels which most fish cannot tolerate.  It's just cruel.    A deep tank would be okay for your goldfish.  A tank with more water surface is best, but this should be fine.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Two goldfish would overstock the tank.     ~Two fancy goldfish require at least 30 gallons with double filtration.  ~Two common goldfish require at least 75 gallons with double the filtration.    Your tank also has the surface area of only a ten gallon tank.|`|rptViwU5aa	you should add one red cap oranda (or) one ryukin. they both get up to $99 but they do make an excellent addition to the tank if kept under the right owner. remember to not kill it.|`|9lZdDU2Vaa	Add one tadpole
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	I feed mine exclusively on Crested Gecko Diet, a powdered, all-in-one diet and crickets once a week.  They can be fed completely on Crested Gecko Diet, but it's fun to watch them hunt.  They don't really eat veggies; they are technically fruitarians.  I always provide a dish of water in the tank as well as giving them a good misting at night.    Temps should be 68-80 during the day and can drop to about 65 at night with no ill effects.  You just want to make sure the temps don't exceed 83 for extended periods of time, or it can cause heat exhaustion or death.  That's pretty much it.  As long as you're providing food and water and keeping them at around 70 degrees or so, you'll be fine.    They are very forgiving and make a great first reptile.|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	They eat insects and fruit based diets.  Water is delivered by a low water dish although they should be misted daily.  They prefer low 70s and should not exceed 80 degrees.  Their tails will not regenerate.  And they can live up to 20 years.  So, be sure you are ready for a 20 year commitment.|`|nYdlsVBAaa	Look here    http://exoticpets.about.com/od/geckos/p/...|`|NIPmV4uMaa	If you have never owned a reptile before, a crested gecko is a great place to start. If you get the setup and feeding schedules right, it is not difficult to maintain a happy, healthy crested.    You must be aware that many of the answers you get on Yahoo answers are from children and people who know virtually nothing about the topic of your question. Google 'crested gecko care' and read as much as you can. Or, for more reliable information, buy a crested gecko book at your local petstore. Online caresheets and books will answer all of your questions. And if you need help, I suggest joining a reptile forum and posting a question in the gecko section. I reccommend www.reptilerooms.com. The answers you get there will be much more helpful and experianced than those you get on this website.    Reptiles aren't the kind of pets you can buy on a whim; you must do months of research in order to be ready to care for a reptile, no matter how small.
LAXxaxAZaa	There are tons of things you can do...    1. Turn her out overnight  2. Keep a sheet on her when you turn her out in the day (I live in Florida and I keep a sheet on my mare... you can get very lightweight ones)  3. Use color shampoo (this works very well... http://horsehealthusa.com/details/EquiTo... )  4. Use Black-As-Knight or Gold-As-Sun (yes, BAK works for palominos... I use it on mine)  5. The sunscreen spray I use I can't remember the name of. But it comes in a black spray bottle with a white top, and it has a picture of horses and a sunset on the front. It works really well.  6. Whiten his mane and tail... it'll make his coat look darker.  7. If you have a show or something, spray him with this ( http://horsehealthusa.com/details/Show-T... ). It won't last forever, but it's good to use for shows and things.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Well, you could try blanketing him. You could use a white sheet, preferably something that doesnt let light through. (That would defeat the purpose) Because it would have to have a neck thing as well, it could be rather hot, which is why I suggest white.|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	UV Protection fly sheet, helps wonders. Feeding detoxifying supplements such as ( Diatomacious earth). Have seen a horse change colors with (DE) from asun bleachedd dun, to a dark dappled dun color...He lives in Arizona. Hope this helps.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	I have a heavy duty fly sheet in a light color that can help quite a bit. The horses cannot wreck them, even when in turn-out because they are tough as nails. I would use that as much as possible - the white color will keep them somewhat cooler than a dark color. I would suggest using one as much as possible before it gets to the really hot season. When it truely gets too hot to turn them out with the fly sheet, then can you stall him in the day and turn him out at night? It would only be for the hottest month or two, and not on cool or cloudy days.  Also, have you tried feeding flax daily? or vegetable oils? The increase in oil will help his coat slightly. Lastly, some people have success with the suppliments such as "Gold as Sun", which I believe is just paprika.  Other than that, genetics will dramatically effect your horse. Some remain sleek and shiny even without sheets. Some fade no matter what you do. You can't do much to change that. And I guess you have to decide how important this is to you. If you aren't showing at a top level, does it really matter if he fades somewhat?|`|hEXb1unraa	Kensington has a great light colored uv protection sheet with neck cover. When its too hot switch your turn out to out all night in all day. Then start adding 1 tsp of paprika in your horses feed once a day. This will get your palomino color to pop and is what is in color enhancing products....its way cheaper and works. Flaxseed oil also helps.  make sure your feeding program and grooming is tops too....the whole program works great but you have to do it all, you will only get partial results if you do bits and pieces. Worked in top halter barns.|`|aKSicRp9aa	my palomino mare doesn't bleach out in the summer. she gets dapples, but I think that is pretty.  she has a shady area and she also has a three sided shed she goes into for shade.   that's all I do, and she still stays a golden honey color (except for the dapples)  she is beautiful.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	You have to keep them blanketed with a good quality turn out blanket.    I show horses too and experience these problems!  Best wishes!|`|AA11027121	Unfortunatly there is not much you can do.  You can get a dark colored flysheet that will cover most of his body.  They even make some with neck covers.  This will help some but they can get hot under the fly sheets.  I own and paint palomino and he gets really faded out by summers end.  I do not show so it is not a big deal to me and not worth keeping him stalled up just for vanity.  He also destroys blankets so he does not get to wear one either.  But that is about all you can do to really protect against the sun.|`|vaulPrAmaa	this is summer - this is a horse - this is natural.  Don't try to prevent it by putting on itching, sweaty, blankets or annoying flysheets.  Don't do that to a horse so you can make it look prettier.  DO NOT STALL YOUR HORSE!  Horses deserve to be outside - it's the least we can do for them.
Qe04KxYoaa	Something is wrong so you need to take her to the vet. She can be fixed at that time, as any responsible owner would have done already.|`|AA10112346	You can do the world a favor.    Spay her!|`|Bw18seFqaa	contact the vet.. get her spayed.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	She probably has mastitis.You need to take her to the vet for antibiotics and get her spayed or it will happen every time she comes into heat.
ak9DrBSwaa	NO. Syrian hamsters are solitary - the result of putting two in the same cage means at least one is eventually killed by the other. Each will need it's own cage.    It's only the dwarf hamsters that can live in communities.|`|J3oW04Jfaa	No, no, no.    They will end up killing each other sooner or later.|`|KeevlZnTaa	Syrian hamsters are very territorial and prefer to live alone. Even related hamsters will fight one another to the death if they are kept together.     I am willing to say there is a 100% chance the full grown female will attack, and eventually kill the baby. Syrians do not like other hamster.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Hamsters prefer to be on their own.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Actually your hamster is an adult, Syrians are solatarie animals, I would introduce them,but leave them alone. Better off in separate cages.|`|FcikBacZaa	NO    it will end in injuries or death.|`|NoGmacqNaa	It will b fine i put my 3 week old baby in with the older hamsters but mine r dwarf hamsters. But I heard thaat syrian hamsters are pretty aggressive toward other hamsters but if u already have Other hamsters in with it and if they are kind to eachother. then i think it would b fine to put them in together! At first Monitor there reactions to it!
KYC0pmH6aa	Put a little bit of pepper on soap and place it near him. SPICY PEPPER. Once he tastes it he will hate it and leave it alone.    Same with socks, but only use one pair so u dont ruin your socks.    REPEAT AS NEEDED.|`|d7bcedc128f094df6e910173d672703eaa	My Lab loves to chew everything including socks, towels and paper, among other things. I just try to keep those items out of her reach as much as possible.  You need to be aware that swallowing socks is a big problem for dogs so you have to hide them from him so he doesn't end up having surgery. As for the bath soap, simply put it out of his reach.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	There is a product called "Grannick's Bitter Apple". It makes things taste weird and bitter to dogs. Make a decoy sock with   bitter apple sprayed on it, and when you get out of the bath tub, switch your soap with a soap sprayed with bitter apple. It will learn the hard way that socks and soap have a horrible flavor.|`|j9axB0YMaa	My dog has gotten into the tub and eaten a bar of soap or two. Solution-Keep the bathroom door shut.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Go bare foot and never wash.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	wish i knew the answer,  my 2 year old lab eats everything.  no matter how much i pick up he finds stuff.  I just spent $1000 3 months ago to have clothing removed from his stomach.    (lethargy, vomitting, or trying to vomit with nothing coming out, and even diarrhea can all mean foreign body)|`|vT4l2caVaa	ughh well my dog cant reach the bars of soap but he can reach trash cans and our solution to that was close the door so if your dog has a way or opening doors then you're doomed but always remember to keep the doors closed. also for the sock thing.....there's this stuff that you can find at pet stores that dogs hate the taste of. you don't have to spray every sock but spray like 2 and leave them out after a few times of nasty taste he'll stop|`|yjT6ToTCaa	Hot sauce on the soap and for the socks first you have find out where he is getting them then keep them out of reach until you train him the command ( LEAVE IT )  this teaches your dog what he is allowed to touch and what not to touch.

283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	if you have ANY hope of getting it back then you better call them ASAP (tonight) leave a message on their machine with your dog's description and your contact info and then go down there very first thing in the morning. Many many pounds are euthanizing animals before they even get in the doors (when they are dropped in night drop) and many many of them euthanize before the person that dumped them even gets out of the parking lot. Sorry to tell you that but pounds are overflowing and they are state mandated to euthanize almost immediately- I know they do that here in Illinois and in Indiana and many parts of Ohio. Please call them NOW!! Leave a message, call them and go over first thing in the morning!!!    oh and re: the husband.. I have been married 27 years and if mine ever did that to one of my animals then he would be the next to be dumped at the pound.|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	usually no.|`|MJnF0pfFaa	um no .|`|q0vKbocHaa	ya, but you will probably have to tell WHY you gave it (even if it wasn't you personally) away, and you'll probably have to pay a fee of some sorts|`|bZjuP1Bqaa	u can go adopted it??????...................................|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Not generally.  In fact, once your household surrenders a dog to a shelter, you are usually 'blacklisted' from adopting any animal from the shelter ever. Some will even share their list with all the other shelters in the area as well.   Why did your husband take your dog to the pound to begin with?|`|VDy99i3oaa	Yeah you can, but you have to pay the same price that someone else would.|`|okAYAGvXaa	I hope NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|QSrmZK6Aaa	I think it depends on a few things.    The pound for one thing may not want to surrender the dog back to you once you have dropped it off. Some shelters may not mind, and if that's the case you may have to pay the adoption fee again to get your dog back.    It also depends on how long ago you dropped the dog off, he could have been adopted out or transferred to another facility by now.    Might I ask why you took your dog to the pound and now want it back?    If you do get your dog back try not to take it to the pound again if you have trouble with it since that is pretty traumatic to the animal.    Good luck and I hope you get your dog back.|`|lezq1eiEaa	yes but only if it has not been adopted out or put to sleep|`|GklW3C48aa	if i had a husband that took my dog to the pound, id ask them if i could trade him for the dog.
w1lh1INHaa	Sadly,your little cat was declawed, and as a result of that she may never really feel unafraid.  A declawed cat feels vulnerable, and they do scare easily.    The best you can do is give her love and affection without catching her.  Get a good, aromatic treat and try and entice her out.      You also might want to schedule a full blood work up.  If she had been outside without food and water, organ damage could have occurred and she just isn't feeling right (if a cat doesn't eat for 48 hours it can develop fatty liver syndrome)  Cats will often hole up when they feel off, or there is some health problem, so give your beautiful baby a free ride to the vet.|`|5jbMpkrEaa	any cat being abandon sees alot of things when they have no place to go. when their alone n dont have anywhere 2 go,  but 2 hide from the things they see n heard. most abandon cats will hide 2 protect themselves. ur cat probably seen his/her share of things . be patient n give her/him the love u have. i know cus i lost my cat(JACK)  for 3 days. i alerted everyone, finally he was found at a neighbors house door. he was happy 2 see me but growled at everyone eles around him. he hid under the couch/bed/ and even hid in the cupboards in the bathroom for at least 2 weeks. but he came around n is the best cat ever. give ur cat sometime, remember being alone they see alot n gone through alot. thank u for giving him/her a home!!!!!!!!|`|AA10977773	The best thing is to keep loving her and give her time.|`|xfHearRDaa	even if the cat is supposed to be loving and smart no matter what breed a cat ( or any animal) has it's own special personality just like a person. so it's completely normal for your cat to be shy it just might be how it is =].|`|AA11317203	Declawing has nothing to do with it (I have only ever had declawed cats and they don't even realize they are declawed and use scratching posts anyway even though they have nothing to scratch with). I adopted a declawed rescue cat a while back and for the first few months she would only come out from under the bed sheets (not even under the bed, in the bed!) if it was completely dark. Your cat might have been abused and because she was alone she doesn't trust humans. She definitely needs time, but also try to socialize her. Dim the lights to make her more comfortable and give her treats or play with a cat teaser (those feathers on a stick things).|`|pFNhhAgRaa	how long ago did you save her? because it is going to take lots of time to come around, could you imagine having your family dump you on the streets with no food or water, or anything to protect yourself? The best advice is to not go after her that much and grab at her, they see it as threatening (until of course they realize your only going to give them love) So just it time, lots of it, I have 6 years experience working with lost, feral and just abandoned cats and trust me it takes A LOT of trust.
u61yKsE3aa	Do you provide UV light with out it your beardie will not process calcium and therefore will not grow propely.  You also need to provide a varied diet with lots of calcium and protien.  It needs to be warm enough as well.  Do you have a basking spot of about 100 degrees and a cool spot around 70-75 They need this to regulate thier body  temp and to grow properly.  Good Luck|`|kBek6QCLaa	I'm sure if he sheds, he'll be growing,     give it time, he's not gonna grow up to an adult in a blink of the eye|`|nI8G21y8aa	shedding normally???  hell grow really fast in a short period of time. 4 inches in 6 months isnt bad|`|eS8wuYRfaa	Well, there are different breeds of beardies, so it's possible you have a smaller breed.  Also, females are typically smaller than males.  Just make sure you have proper temperatures and UV light in the tank.  Those will both affect growth. What he's eating may also affect growth..make sure he's getting a varied diet of insects and veggies.   Like with everything, some of them are just smaller than others.
nxXYuTiMaa	I admire all reptiles. But if you are looking for a pet you can handle and not worry about it biting you. No a snapper is not one. It will always bite. and it can seriously hurt your sliders. And should be kept alone.  I'm glad to know you ask questions before you do something.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Keep each turtle in a different tank and you will be fine. Neither species is renowned as a friendly turtle. However, both are fairly tough and some of us find them interesting.|`|2r5yq35paa	Do you want your red eared sliders to be lunch for the snapper? Do you want your finger to be bitten off? If you answered no to any of these, do not buy a snapping turtle.|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	They will eventually recognize you but what is your definition of a good pet?  It is not recommended that you add them to the same habitat that your red eared sliders are in.  In fact, they recommend that the common snapper lives alone.|`|yUBHtCIWaa	contrary to popular belief, common snappers can be kept with other turtles of the same size with no problems. however, red eared sliders like to bully other turtles and will probably nip at the long tail of the snapper so i wouldn't.
aP4bkYOCaa	That's exactly what it is, exactly the way you described it: An "EXTREME funk." Sometimes it can be fishy, but it's generally a super strong, unpleasant odor.    Cats can seep from their anal glands when they get excited or frightened.    I've included a link with a little more info about anal glands in cats- happy reading (lol), and best of luck with your cat. :)|`|w1lh1INHaa	Sure sounds like an anal gland secretion.  It has a pungent, fetid-musky smell (think skunk, but not quite as pleasant), and is used to mark territory and fend of unwanted visitors.  It can also "release" due to stress or excitement.  If this continues, however, you might want to go to the vet and have him show you how to release the anal sacs (lucky you!) because your cat doing this frequently could mean the sacs need to be released (not pleasant, but not as smelly in the long run).|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Sounds like anal secretion...Funk is a nice way of putting it lol|`|lgCuX7PAaa	that's how I'd put it|`|AA11457471	Kinda like rotten fish.
a2cjwMKcaa	Live rock is called 'Live' because of the marine (saltwater) organisms that live on and in it. These form part of the natural cycles within a marine tank and help maintain the water quality.    If you put Live rock in fresh water it will quickly turn into dead smelly bits of old coral rock. The last thing you want in a freshwater tank.    Ian|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Live rock, in the usual meaning of the term, is only used in marine (ocean/saltwater) aquaria.   Putting it in fresh water would be a disaster. All the "live" stuff would quickly die and rot, causing massive pollution that would kill everything else in the tank.    However, to answer your question, live rock is usually composed of fossilized coral or other calcareous minerals, so it would tend to make fresh water harder and more alkaline (it would tend to raise pH).|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Live rock would die out completely in a freshwater tank causing a massive ammonia spike.   Depending on the composition of the rock itself it could also cause an increase in pH.   As it would die completely back since the various organisms and bacteria living in it are saltwater creatures it no amount of care in a freshwater tank is going to to anything for it
gwDftPBsaa	I would start withs something easy like plants like anubias and java fern. I would attatch them to bog/driftwood as a start in plants then you can start buying fertilizer and stuff for ground plants.|`|o9dMd2rBaa	Well plants aren't that hard to take care of.     The kind of plants you can sustain depends upon on your light source. If you have a low light source, only can have light light plants. If you have have a higher light source, can have higher light plants such as the pink/red ones.     Other thing that can help is CO2 injector    There is a specialty substrate to help plants grow too, though you can could use regular gravel too if you wanted to|`|37TowRL7aa	ive never been a master of plants, but i just buy them, put them somewhere in any substrate/ gravel or bog wood, and get a plant light and they live(untill eaten)
F0qPuMGCaa	I think you need her a few days to settle in and then start handling her|`|LR15VM9Iaa	leave her alone till tomorrow then pick up some millet at a pet store bids go crazy for this then lower it through the top of the cage and let her eat a little she will realize that she loves millet then try to feed a little piece of it to her through the cage the take the whole spray and open the door offer he some and once she will eat it take off a small piece and try t get her to eat it out of your hand with your hand in the cage make slow movements nothing jerky as this will cause her to spaz out again don't worry as this is a parakeet and they don't hurt that bad if they bite but still be careful they can still bite and its uncomfortable    hope this helps|`|AA12153474	It's important that you give your 'keet time to adjust to its new home.  After he's settled down, you can start trying to earn his trust.  You can try luring him out of the cage onto your hand with a treat.  Just make sure you don't grab him suddenly or he'll be frightened and you'll destroy any trust you've gained.|`|e6wo7czgaa	You should let her adjust to the new environment, this will help her. Once she seems settled down start calling out calm and soothing words towards her. This will help the bird understand you don't intend to hurt her, however she will still be uncomfortable with you for a little bit. You have the right idea on putting the hand in the cage, just don't move towards her. Don't move your hand at all. This may sound silly but it helps the bird become use to your hand like an "object". After 2-5 min when the bird has settled down and has calmed down with your hand being in her "house"  you can slowly and gentle move your hand in one motion, not towards the bird. Do this for about 2 min after she has calm down. Than go towards her gently and with soothing words. If she starts to freak out again stop. Exactly when she freaks out but do not move your hand from back to you. let it stay until she calms down, and this is when you have to wait. You don't move forward after she has calm down. You leave her along. because that is what she wants right now so its sort of like a reward. She'll begin to think that being calm around you will give her what she wants and she will continue to do so. But she will allow you to come closer and closer each time. You should be able to go near her less than 2 days.   You just have to give the bird a 5 min break to be by herself after you wait for her to settle down and leave her along. This does work so that she will be very comfortably with you.|`|Hv7L5CrGaa	You have to be patient, and allow her to be used to her new environment. Handling her everyday helps, put your hand on her cage and just leave it there. She may panic at first, but soon she will realize that you're not harming her. Hand feeding her is a good idea, because this way you two can bond and you'll have a tame budgie. Put some fruit or millet on your palm and slowly put your hand in the cage, displaying the food to your parakeet. A 15 minute session everyday would be fine, and soon she'll be very used to you.     Try talking quietly to her, or even reading to her. Always use a calm gentle and soothing voice, and never make sudden movements, or you might frighten her. Soon you can teach her to step up on to your finger. Remember, even though it is tiring waiting for her to get used to you, never grab her suddenly, it will break the chances of her getting used to you. I had a budgie that was also very scared at first, and sometimes she would lash out at me and bite. Soon, after using this method, she was tame and became a great pet. I really hoped this helped, and good luck! :)|`|AA10431326	I am getting ready to get my first bird and was wondering how the bird acted when you got it home. Now I am a little more prepared.|`|vpkrpRhTaa	well, ur gonna have to leave it alone for awhile let it settle down  after that try to be nice to it like...give it a seed, talk to it, and let it play with u and if u dont want it to fly crzy cut the wings    -good luck-
EyKJ737daa	I have read that puffers can be aggressive fin-nippers but are otherwise very playful fish.  Mollies on the other hand from having my own can also be aggressive and not just towards other fish but themselves.  I would be concerned that the mollies may hurt the puffer.  I have 3 full grown mollies with 7 babies. (3 from 1 litter and 4 from another) and 1 clown loach.  They all seem to be friends but my male orange mollie seems to be getting an aggressive streak in him lately because he seems to have a bit of competition with another male baby that is now trying to mate with his girlie fish.  So be careful and if in doubt, I'd check with the fish shop, they are usually pretty cluey on that sort of stuff. I always ask my fish shop about what goes with what before I add anything.  Good luck and all the best, sounds like a very happy tank otherwise :-)|`|P3w07SsGaa	the puffer will nip at the mollies i wouldnt trust it because the puffer wont swallow them he;'ll pick at them and probly adventully kill them|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your fish are brackish, not saltwater.    I would not add the puffer to your tank.
fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Wow he looks so much like a rat terrier!!!  His head does look like it to me.  I could also possibly see a hint of chihuahua in him.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	a rat/chihuahua mix??? a lot of breeds do not look like the pure preds becasue the toy breeds (ALL breeds) are so over bred and bred by backyard breeders they loose their physical characteristics that identify them as a pure bred. there are dna tests now.     you can always teach an old dog new tricks. but I would be weary of any animal that specifically says "no children" or "no cats". it will take a lot of time and training to know for sure.|`|VF5Htmovaa	I got it! Jack-Rat Terrier  Jack Russell / Rat Terrier Hybrid  I am almost too sure of it!|`|wCDAYGd0aa	really cute dog looks like a chi chi,  terrier mix      I think he should be fine with children they are going to grow up with him and know how to treat him|`|jWmnSXlLaa	He does look terrier to me some. Also I am sure they can train him to be around kids in many cases on the other hand he could of harmed a child before. Within the next few years they will be able to tell if he should be around a new baby or not, He is cute.,|`|fyWGMB9caa	looks like a bit of smooth fox terrier too . my terrier is fine with small children but some aren't|`|Wv8YDmRHaa	Probably a Jack Rat Terrier. Any dog that has been socialized and trained correctly to be calm and submissive around family, friends, other dogs and just people in general will usually be good with young ones. The key is to be the pack leader of your home keep the dog calm indoors and never ever let the dog become obsessive over anything. Over time the owners need to handle the dog a lot, by grabbing its hair, ears,tail, feet so the dog will be used to this behavior before a baby is introduced. When a baby is introduced the parents need to be calm and not be exited at all! After they have made the dog sit and be calm, let the dog come to the baby and let it smell the baby, do not take the baby to the dog. Over the next few days the parents will need to enforce new rules with the dog when the baby is brought home so the dog will understand that the baby is considered a pack leader as well.|`|KLM8Lv2Saa	probably some bostan terrier and maybe even some collie|`|jzBzwBYaaa	rat terrier cross?|`|hIJRrIWiaa	He looks similar to a jack russel terrier.|`|sxWUfJ6oaa	Wow, he's cute!     Anyway, after volunteering at a shelter and seeing many dogs, I'd say this is an unusual mix. He seems to certainly have rat terrier in him, and maybe a hint of Boston Terrier! On the other note, if you train him to be calm with other children BEFORE they have their children, he will probably be adjusted to having children around. Hope this helps!|`|P2yRAWiJaa	1.  There is NO boston terrier in this dog at all.  The color isn't right, the head is shaped wrong, eyes are nowhere near like a b.t., to small and to leggy, and to thin.    Now....I think this is a Chihuahua x Rat Terrier mix.  Legs like a chi, ears like a terrier and chi, face resembles a chi (nose & eyes), body size would be that of a chi/rat terrier mix as well.    Hope this helped you. :)      Since he's been neutered he may be better with children also.  Get some basic training and socialization done and he'll be o.k.
IrdZKYT3aa	Whn you say leaf fish, do you mean the little yellowy guys with brown/black spots?  If so, how big?  When they're little they can be kind of timid and a little bit of a victim.  I woudn't do any gourami with 2 needle nose gars.  I only have one gar, so he claimed one sides surface and my gourami's live at the other end.  Any other surface dweller would have problems interacting with the gars.  A gar can be territiorial and may take umberage to others invading his space.  Try some nice cichlids.  My gar lives fine with 4 parrot cichlids and everyone gets along fine.  I've also got one jewel cichlids who dosen't bother them.  Nice small ones should be fine for the gar and larger leaf fish, like peacocks, german rams, and parrots.  Make sure the leaf fish have plenty of places to hide so they don't get too stressed.  Don't get things like the bala shark, I tried and he just swam too much like food for the gar to leave him alone.  You could try a rainbow shark, they stay about 4 inches and are actually very calm for a semi aggressive.  No red tails as they can become very aggressive as they get about 6 inches long.  Just make sure they are full size so the gar dosen't try for them.  Long skinny fish like that may be in danger depending on your gars size.  Mines  about 8 inches long.  Eels are a good choice as long as you keep them well fed.  My snowflake eel lives with my gar and cichlids as well as my random platy and no one fights.  Just make sure to keep him well fed or he may become a danger to the leaf fish if they are small.  I toss in lots of feeders for the gar and the snowflake, so they self feed.  Also check out some bottom feeders, like catfish.  I don't recomend spotted catfish with your pleco just b/c my pleco, about 6 inches, sometimes chases and attacks my spotted synodontis catfish, about 5 inches.  But he leaves my halfmoon alone.  Hope this helps!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	What size tank do you have?    I don't like to offer suggestions unless I know they will be okay in your tank.    ~I wouldn't want to add anything else to the 55. I would rather devote the space to the fish already there. They will grow very large.|`|DqOkUgVsaa	hey buddie why dont you try at least 1 oscar
SZOMVGBRaa	Throw in a algae pellet or two at night after the lights go out. If you have other catfish and bottom feeders then they may out compete him for food. Nothing you can do about that really. My Common pleco doesn't like to eat anything but algae tabs either. I have tried cucumber,zucinni,lettuce but he won't have any of it. If you want a pleco that cleans up algae great and eats cucumber and vegetables get a Bristol Nose pleco. Depending on the tank size you can get a few if you like. Here's a link. http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Catfish,%20P...|`|9a056324e084aa96722167b89dc65ce2aa	I assume you mean you are feeding it algae ( pellets probably.) Honestly, I had a pleco for YEARS and i only bought the pellets once. He ate the algae that was in the tank, even algae I couldnt see. After I cleaned the tank, I bought pellets because I was afraid he would die, but he never touched a pellet. He didnt die either. I think there is alot of algae that we cant see, because that thing was always eating, even when there was no visible algae. I never tried to give him a cucumber though. Im sure he is fine. If not, you cant do much.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	try feeding him at night, with the light off after the other fish have settled down some|`|3pDnkzFfaa	try cutting a piece of zuccini about 4 inches long and about 1/4 inch thick and microwave it for 20 sec then let it cool for 5 min and then attach it to the side of the tank with a vegi clip.
EQvAbyvcaa	Call the vet.  A horse should always be checked out by a vet before getting chiropractic care or any other alternative treatments.    Can you ride him ???   NO!!!.  He sounds like he is dead lame and has been for a while.   He obviously has a serious problem and no one is doing anything to help him.  Give him a break.  If he is so lame after two weeks off, doesn't it make sense that this is has been developing for quite some time and could be life threatening for him???  There could be any one of a million things wrong.  Get a diagnosis so he can get some help.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The horse needs medical attention from a vet, not a chiropractor.  Any number of conditions can produce lameness.  No one should ever continue riding a lame horse.  You should get the vet out to diagnose the cause, which really should have been done in the first place.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	Don't ride until a determination has been made by a vet.  Has he been kicking the stall wall perhaps?|`|d7cCWJCoaa	1. Never ride a horse with undiagnosed lamness!  2. You should be calling a vet (and informing his owner if you haven't already).  Does he have any other symptoms? Swelling, heat, etc? Have you put pressure on the soles of his feet? Any tenderness, heat, etc? Is he arthritic, might it be an abscess?
x8Vgu6acaa	When you are stepping over them they get scared and are trying to get out of your way.    This is a very dangerous thing to do.  To save your dog from being stepped on, don't step over it.  have it move out of your way.    I have little dogs and they watch where I am going and keep out of my feets way.  I taught them this by not stepping over them.  (because I almost squished one doing the same thing you are doing)|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	They are trying to move out of your way instead of having you move out of theirs.

pcoa5zH2aa	I got this off a website.    * The female Goldfish are slightly bigger than the males and look even heavier in the abdomen when they are full of eggs.    * Male Goldfish develop white spots on their gills and pectoral called breeding tubercles during spawning time.    * Males have midline ridges on their undersides beginning from the back of their pelvic fins and ending at their vent opening. This feature can be absent or smaller in females.    * Males have firm abdomen while in females; the area between the pelvic fins and the anal fins is more pliable.    * Male Goldfish have longer and pointed pectorals as well as stiff fin ray, while females have more rounded pectorals and shorter, finer front fin rays.    * Male goldfish have smaller and more oval anal openings and the anal fins are not as thick as that of the female goldfish who has a larger and rounder anal opening with a slight protrude. The anal fin is also thicker.    * The spawning time is the easiest time to distinguish the boys from the girls. The female opening will look larger and more swollen as the eggs begin to ripen. She would look big and heavier. Since fish reproduce through external fertilization, you can make out when a male is ready by the white breeding tubercles and you can actually push out the milt through his ventral opening by running a gentle finger along his sides.    * There is one more obvious, but kind of time taking way to make out which one of your fish is male and female. Find out who is chasing who  the chaser will be the male and the chased and tired out one will be the female! Its the natural tendency on part of the male goldfish to chase and nudge at a females rear part.|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	Yes,  The females tend to be larger and rounder than the males.  But they need to be mature to be sure.  You can always wait until they spawn, then you'd know for sure.
w1lh1INHaa	Wipe her tears, stroke her hair, massage her back, hold her, let her cry, and shed a tear for her loss      Your girlfriend needs to let it out, and there is nothing you can say right now, simply offer her your quiet strength and comfort.

A comforting hug and maybe her favorite dessert would also probably help. And don't expect her sadness to fade quickly; it's likely to last for a while. Time will heal all wounds eventually.    Your girlfriend is very lucky to have a boyfriend who is so sympathetic.|`|oldKepHXaa	screw her|`|HwujORd2aa	All I can say is when my kitty had to be put to sleep, my boyfriend was there with me when it happened, and after we got home, he patiently listened to all the stories, rehashing of what happened, my talking about it over and over.  Really that's the best you can do.  She wasn't even nice to him but he knew her personality and made the best of it when we moved in together.  Even today we tell stories about that cat!  Just listen when she wants to talk about it.  Or even mention it when you think she's thinking about it, like when you're on the couch and you say, "remember when kitty used to come up and bat at your shoelaces here? that was so cute! I miss that cat!"  It shows that you know how much she cared.|`|kgTllrk3aa	You cant really say anything. Just let her cry on you.... DO NOT GET HER A NEW CAT RIGHT NOW! wait a month or so....|`|AA10250756	When my cat died, I found comfort from this poem a friend gave to me.     They will not go quietly,  the cats who've shared our lives.  In subtle ways they let us know  their spirit still survive.  Old habits still make us think  we hear a meow at the door.  Or step back when we drop  a tasty morsel on the floor.  Our feet still go around the place  the food dish used to be,  And, sometimes, coming home at night,  we miss them terribly.  And although time may bring new friends  and a new food dish to fill,  That one place in our hearts  belongs to them....  and always will.  ~ Linda Barnes ~|`|pUaGFbzaaa	let her cry then on valentines day take her to a pet store get a baby animal and go on a date... she'll feel better and love you more =P|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Another poem:    And Creator asked the feline spriit  "Are you ready to come home?"    "Oh, yes, quite so," replied the precious soul  And, as cat, you know I am most able  To decide anything for myself."    "Are you coming then?" asked Creator.    "Soon," replied the whiskered angel,  "But I must come slowly  For my human friends are troubled.  For you see, they need me, quite certainly,"    "But don't they understand? asked Creator  "That you will never leave them?  That your souls are intertwined?  For all eternity?  That nothing is created or destroyed?  It just is...forever and ever and ever?"    "Eventually they will understand,"  Replied the glorious cat,  "For I will whisper into their hearts  That I am always with them  I just am ... forever and ever and ever."    Author unknown.|`|RF34IHkFaa	There's not much you can say to make her feel better. Just hold her tight while she cries on your shoulder.     Don't listen to people. My step mom's dog, Tawny, died a few years ago and she couldn't say her name without crying. And we just got her a new puppy and now she feels better. And my step-bro, Chris, was really attatched to his cat, When he died we immediatly got him a new kitten and he had his hands full with her. And he wasn't so sad. So when a pet dies you can't replace him/her. But you can fill up the huge whole in her heart.|`|XPB6Ogj0aa	There is nothing you can say, just be there for her.  She has to grieve in her own way.  May I suggest    http://www.petloss.com    A wonderful, healing website for those of us who has lost our fur-kids.  She won't be alone and the candle ceremony really helps (believe me).  Warning the Rainbow Bridge story will make one cry but also gives one a lot of hope and relief.  I have copied it here (hope that alright).      THE RAINBOW BRIDGE  Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge.  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge.   There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together.    There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable.  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by.   The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind.     They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster.     You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart.     Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....     Author unknown...
syH2DpN7aa	What level of lighting do you have, how many watts per gallon? Do you have CO2 injection or use a chemical like seachem flourish excel as a source of carbon? What sort of substrate do you have? So long as you have at least 2 watts per gallon, you could add riccia fluitans, dwarf  hc,hairgrass, rotala wallichii. The last two will need trimming now and then, as will any stem plants that you put in your tank. I also have blyxa japonica, but it will eventually fill up most of the tank, so I'll probably move some to my other tanks. In my tank I have HC in the foreground, driftwood with java moss, riccia and anubias nana in the midground and blyxa japonica and dwarf hairgrass in the background. I found the website below really helpful, although most of the plants weren't available in my area it gave me an idea of setting out the plants and I found similiar alternative plants in my LFS.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Crypts stay relatively small and are very hardy.|`|NUIrBHXgaa	Maybe some kind of sword? like red or green melon sword, ozelot sword, amazon sword, oriental sword?

I have 2 Chi's and one is 2.5 lbs and the other is 1.4 lbs. They are only 14weeks old. I have been putting coats on them to take them out because it has been so cold.

But, if you are doing it to keep them warm outside I say go for it.|`|TuHfZdYGaa	    However he usually climbs out of it!

But when people dress them up in doggy athletic suits or summer dresses then that's when it's wrong and reduclious! Dogs aren't acessories! They don't belong in purses either.  If she's cold and it's in the middle of winter, then yes put a winter jacket on her.
OqAOCBnFaa	My fish act like that too. They are like very funny to watch. Make sure you have their gravels washed, the water is at the right temperature, and that there is enough water in the bowl. ALSO that you FEED them!|`|c77qsgdvaa	It might just be stressed from the changes. Did you wash the gravel first? I would check the water parameters to double check.
IrdZKYT3aa	Depends on the brand, many companies boast that they are "unable to be overdosed".  I imagine it would be a shock to the fish, but it would have to be a ridiculous amount to overdose.  If the water is bubbling excessivlly, this can be a sign of too much conditioner.  I usually have the new water set to the side and dose it there rather than in the tank.  This way if you mess up by adidng too much you can dump it and start over.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	A small overdose, maybe up to 10 times what you should have added, should have no effect.    If you dump in a whole bottle, all bets are off.    Ian|`|p9A61dFgaa	Nothing really should happen but if its alot could shock the fish and kill a few. Do a partial water change to dilute it.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	It depends on what you mean by "too much."  You can add at least three or four times the standard dose with no harm to the fish at all (I'm sure I've done this a few times from pure absent-mindedness). But at some point, it would be too much. If you dropped a fish into a tank of pure AmQuel, Prime, or StartRight, I have no doubt the fish would die. And no, I don't want to do this experiment, but if you decide to try it, let us know how it comes out.
KEYgd73saa	They will absolutely breed.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that-- this is how all the special strains of fish in stores are created.  Without selective breeding, you'd be stuck with brown Guppies, brown and drab green Discus, and dull Angels.  The fry between brother and sister will have NO issues, and you won't start to see any trouble associated with inbreeding until the 6th, 7th, or 8th generations of inbreeding, at which point, I'd recommend moving out of the bloodline for one or two generations.    I'm sure I'll hear some lovely things to the contrary; I direct those people to these sites: http://www.calgaryaquariumsociety.com/ar...  http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/009/v872...  http://www.fisheries.go.th/fish/web/TCTP...|`|HBsc2wwLaa	no, they will still breed but the fry will be poor quality, as will any fry after that, for obvious reasons. If you can, try swapping with someone to get some fresh genes.

We always buy a subscription to "Your Horse", it's a UK magazine. We are in Canada, but they mail them around the world!  Alround they are the best with awesome articles and lessons!!!  Good luck!
jQvT6k7raa	You would have to have his papers. Meaning, you would have to know that his sire and dam were doth registered, and you would need their papers. As long as you have these, you can certainly register him!

The first thing you need to know is that in order to register a Thoroughbred older than 2 years, it's going to cost you $2,000.  http://www.jockeyclub.com/registry.asp?s...    You would also need the Stallion Service certificate signed by the owner of your horse's sire.  The Stallion Service certificate and the Report of Mares Bred, which the stallion owner submits to The Jockey Club annually, enable The Jockey Club to verify that your horse's dam was bred to his sire.    If you cannot obtain a Stallion Service certificate, or if the owner of the stallion failed to submit a Report of Mares Bred, you will not be able to register your horse.    If you decide to proceed, the rules regarding registered names for Thoroughbreds:    The name can consist of no more than 18 characters, including spaces between words and punctuation.  Spaces count as one character and puntuation counts as one character.      The name cannot be one currently in use or which has been in recent use.  You can use this site to determine if a name is available:  https://www.registry.jockeyclub.com/regi...    If you name a horse after a living person, you have to have the written permission from that person, which has to be submitted to The Jockey Club.    Names cannot have any off-color, lewd, or suggestive connotation.  If a name is in a language other than English, a translation of the name has to be submitted.    Names cannot have any commercial use (.e.g, you couldn't name a horse Ronald McDonald or Shop at Macy's or something like that).      Good luck!
JwYwsrTzaa	There a few accessories you can try. The Illusion collar is great. It stays in the spot that gives you best control of the dog. Haltis work the same way as well.    To help better control him on walks, stop walking when he gets too far ahead and there is tension on the leash. Once you stop walking, he really has no where to go. Once he walks back toward you and there is slack on the leash, continue walking. He will start to realize that if he pulls, he doesn't walk.    Once he is not pulling anymore, start making the leash shorter. You will eventually get him to the point of walking next to you with slack.    Bring treats with you on your next walk. When he sees another dog or person, focus his attention on you by calling his name and give him a command. If he focuses on you, give him a treat. He will learn that he is rewarded when he listens and gives you his full attention.    After time and practice, he will learn not to pull and you should be able to voice control him from pulling when he sees another dog or person.    Hope this helps..... :)|`|80S8U7Edaa	Yes, you need a harness.. it's the only way. And soft collar harnesses are the best!    http://www.gingerpuplane.com/shop-dog-ha...|`|y6p1ZAdRaa	Try the Dog whisperer site He gave a few hints that really helped when Training my dog|`|jXs6CtWNaa	I've been a veterinary technician for 9 years and this is a question often brought up to me, first thing i noticed is you saying he is choking himself, if you are using a choke collar i advise against it because after all that choking it can cause a collapsed trachea and other severe damage to the throat, also id advise against prong collars as they are painful, what i would recommend would be a body harness, you have more control over the dog.   Be strict with him telling him to "heal" or w.e word you use to enforce that, and the second he starts to pull or disrespect your demand you yank him back and in a firm voice tell him/her to "heal".... puppies are extremely stubborn and depending on the breed even more stubborn than others.  You just have to be more stubborn and eventually he will get the idea|`|Ei85kgfdaa	A harness will only encourage pulling.    Get him into obedience classes where he can work in a controlled environment with distractions. If he does need a prong collar your qualified trainer can help you to fit one to his neck and show you how to use it. Don't go to a class at a pet store.    You also need to exercise him before taking him out as well as working with him on 'leave it'. Its a very handy command in many situations and will help you out greatly on walks. Bring a toy along or some treats if you have to, to use as distractions and as a reward.|`|lhbEY5eJaa	the reason he does that is because he thinks hes going to get to where he wants to go faster if he pulls so to prove him wrong:    start off by walking him,the minute he tugs even a little stop and call him to you, once he comes pat him once or twice and/or give him a treat and continue to walk,when he pulls stop and call him to you,now keep doing that and he should stop puling. at first you will not be walking very much but will be stopping more than walking, that's ok continue that  soon he will learn that if he pulls it will only take longer for him to get to where he wants to go. try to keep him by your side and if he goes out from by your side even by a 4 small steps do the same process  that way he will not be leading you but you will be leading him  moving when he pulls only encourages the behaviour  don't yell but be firm when you call him it makes it more effective    hope i helped  good luck      P.S. make sure u can fit 2 fingers under the collar no more is needed,because if more space is given he will be more likely to slip out:)|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Honestly, I would go back to the gentle leader.  He threw a tantrum and you gave up...he won.  Most dogs are going to object to the gentle leader because they simply aren't used to it.  Ignore them and keep walking.  My older dog accepted hers simply because it was the only way she got to go outside, even to potty.  Once she learned that the GL meant she got to go outside, she accepted it pretty well.    If you are going to try a harness, purchase one that specifically prevents pulling such as the no-pull harness that the GL people make.  I really don't like harnesses especially for dogs that pull because any regular harness is going to ENCOURAGE pulling.  Sled dogs wear a harness rather than a collar to pull sleds partly because the harness encourages them to pull harder (and partly because pulling 1,000lbs from a collar around the neck is dangerous).    Regardless of what training tool you decide to go with, it would be best to hire a trainer at least to help you fit the collar or harness.  A properly fitted collar will not come off over a pitbull mix's head.  Some dogs with narrow wedge shaped heads, like greyhounds or collies, can slip a properly fitted buckle collar.  If your dog managed to slip his collar that means it was NOT properly fitted and is too loose.  You might want to consider replacing his regular collar with a martingale (also known as a "greyhound") style collar.  These are limited slip collars and are designed so that they slide on over the head but when the dog tries to back out of the collar the collar tightens just enough that it is impossible for the dog to slip the collar.  They are not choke collars and should not be fitted so tightly that they actually choke the dog.|`|cIheKVRmaa	I had the same problem, I then started to use a harness and the problem started to go away and finally stopped, now he walks right beside me.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I know you have tried a gentle leader but they come in different styles.  They come in a harness style that keeps them from pulling as much and it does not go around the face.  I think it is called a gentle leader easy walk. We use this for our pug/terrier cross who doesnt have a big enough muzzle to use the other.    We also have a halti for our lab who has difficulties with pulling.  It however is one that goes around the face.  He pawed at it at first but now is fine with it.|`|JbDfdJb8aa	Well, there is always obedience training but when you really think about it your dog is having the time of his life. Our miniature poodle chokes himself all the time and barks like a maniac. But, you can just see his tail helicoptering around when its time to go outside. Why break his spirit and enthusiasm? Its just part of the animal's personality.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Make sure that he always knows your the boss and "top dog" that way he's less likely to question your authority and he'll behave better. Make sure you discipline him and let him know what he's doing is wrong and not acceptable but reward him when he's listens and does a good job. Also try a harness to attach his leash to it can give you more control and won't choke him.|`|0KTVNTYYaa	follow these steps    1. get a harness (he won't choke himself)  2. hold his lead short when he starts 2 pull  3. reward good behavior|`|iJtuhLMTaa	I would recommend a pinch collar, they don't hurt the dog and are less likely to cause injury than a training collar (AKA choke chain)   but make sure you have someone show you how to properly fit it (it should fit just under the ears and only needs to be loose enough to fit one finger under it)   and it should also only be used during walks/training and not left on when the dog is unsupervised.       A regular harness puts you pulling against the strongest part of the dog (its shoulders) and gives you little control over a strong dog.  A no pull harness will prevent pulling but does little to actually train the dog.|`|kBjzKyZyaa	I would try getting him a harness, as well as backpack for dogs that you can weight down, they sell them at most pet stores, that way he's doing double the work during his walk with will tired him out quicker and give him more exercise in a shorter walk. Also enrolling him in a obedience class would help you control him better.|`|gaZswZjLaa	ol d age|`|r4XgSgAmaa	I'm not entirely sure, I don't have a dog, but maybe you could try an obedience school|`|CiF80lwwaa	you should use a harness. it doesnt choke him, and he'll learn to stay closer to you.|`|iKHu2MBxaa	Take him to dog training classes...they now have them at either pet smart or pet co.|`|qy73mdfHaa	Wear him out first. The best way is to get one of those attachments you put on the axel of your bike with a short "leash" and ride/run him around. If you get one that is around the seat or handle bars etc, if he gets distracted, it won't be hard to pull you over. Axel is best. I run my dogs for about a mile and a half and they are content to do anything I want them too. And they love the bike! When they see me pull it out they go bonkers! Dogs love to run, what better way to keep them in shape?|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	You need to enroll in an obedience class and train him. You will both learn something.    He may be a candidate for a prong collar or possibly a Halti or Gentle Leader as a training tool.  Both are effective and safe when used correctly and don't hurt the dog.|`|pOgzmCn2aa	I always stood by the gentle leader because it worked miracles with my dog. However I do understand your concern with him pawing at it and rubbing his face on the ground!     Try a harness-- they can not get out of it, and sometimes it helps ease the pulling because it will put up more of a resistence than a collar, without that bother of choking!    You can also look into paid dog training, they do offer classes for heeling, and sometimes that's what it takes.    Best of luck!|`|NaENZSJRaa	i no what u going throw i have a pit and he dus the same thing firs is that u can try a body harness that can help but what i find that works is if i pull his chock collar up to the top of his neck and lift up on it keeping his head up not allowing him to put his head down so he cant pull. (i dont put it on chock tho i hock it to the ring that dos int chock i just like the way it looks) and wan people walk by i make him site down and hold hes chest with him between my legs. and now wan i walk him he dont pull that bad and if i tell him to site he sites and thin i tell him to stay and keep saying it tell the destruction is gone and then we continue walking. hop i helped|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	He might require a muzzle if he's a pit mix depending on where you live. I would recommend a martingale collar. It doesn't pinch but the dog controls when it will tighten as the dog pulls. Make sure his collar is fitted properly. You should only be able to get two fingers under it. First have treats in your pocket. Second try walking your dog in the yard first. Have him to your side and use a treat to lure him to follow you at the proper heal position which should be beside your left leg. Lead loose (no tension). As soon as he pulls you freeze. Don't move. Have him sit and start walking again. You won't get far but he will learn that pulling gets him nowhere. Give him a treat when he is walking properly.If he gets distracted and tries to pull away from the heal position (beside you at the left) you pull the lead straight up (not on an angle) and it creates a "pop" to correct your dog keep walking at your side. Its hard without visual demonstration but hopefully this is helpful. Be consistent and he should improve. Gradually bring him to distractions. Have a friend walk buy and see how he acts and go from there. Slowly interact him with kids so he knows how to behave. You can't throw him in the crowd at the beginning and expect perfect results with a dog that loves to greet everyone (my dog) Good Luck!|`|97sZDDUZaa	I would definitially recommend getting a harness and all puppies are horrible walkers. My 2 would only walk on the grass or would pull me to something and would pee on every tree! Make up a routine and take him for a wlak every 2-4 hours and keep him by your side. Dont let him be behind or infront. You could also try bringing him to an obiedence school.
onKfEYL0aa	I have adopted several dogs over the years. The best dog I ever had is my 4 year old Yellow Lab. We adopted her 2 years ago from a family that could not give her the time and attention that she needed. Labs are very loyal, smart, and athletic. My Lab will play ball till she drops and likes to swim in our pond. She is great with young kids and all people. They are great watch dogs, and if provoked she will protect the family if she needs to. Our Lab has gone to obedience school for training when she was a pup. She listens well and does not wonder out of our yard. We do live in a rural wooded area and she gets along well with the wild and other domestic animals.   I would definitely recommend a female. They tend to be smarter and easier to train.|`|RUf73hG1aa	You can't go wrong with a boxer.  Mine loves to go for walks, runs, rides in the car, he is up for anything.  My boxer is very social.  He loves everyone he meets and he is very smart.  He has figured out how to open the doors in my house and get into rooms he shouldn't be in.  He is not a small dog.  Mine is almost 10 months old and is 65 pounds.  He was pretty easy to train because boxers are naturally clean dogs.  He cleans up after himself when he spills his food on the floor and when we drop crumbs on the floor.  He is not really good as a guard dog right now because he still thinks that everyone he sees is coming to see him and be his friend.  He has no threats or enemies at all.  Another plus is that most boxers have docked tails, so no tail to slap you in the legs or the face or to knock things off a shelf.    Get a boxer!!  They are wonderful and will love you forever.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	I think a lab would be good, and plus their are a lot of labs and lab puppies in shelters. You can try adopting from   http://www.petfinder.com|`|uHCIxJmqaa	well we have a lil chichuaua and she great around people she knows but hateful towards everyone else. i would say the best mannered dog and great loving and playful would be a golded retriever or lab. may be bigger dogs but great mannered and good around most everyone!!|`|QxxCN4pVaa	Boxer  Collie  Irish setter    i love of these breeds|`|NSKimt1Qaa	A Border Collie would be a good choice, but whatever breed of dog you think you might be interested in, read up on it yourself before making the final decision.  I'm glad you are taking this decision seriously and really thinking about it, as there are so many people who don't and they get a dog and later regret it.  They don't give it the proper care, attention or love and finally, they dump it off at the pound or if the dog is lucky, give it to a good home.  I think when you get your dog, you will quickly bond with it and it will become a member of your family.  You may also want to check out the animal shelters and/or breed rescue groups.  edit: okay, I just saw your P.S.  Good for you in saving a life!|`|8YT3nsKraa	german shepards are great companions...  they are very responcive and are very protective of their family   and they are great with kids and they love to just run around and play|`|uERNim0yaa	A good portion of the animals in shelters are puppies and purebreds.

Pm8nsCGZaa	Layman's terms  :-)  It is just when an un-trusting horse finally trusts you.  When he does he will follow you and want to come to you and be in your hip pocket. I don't know that a round pen is the only way to do this. But the "thing to do" is chase them around and away from you, til they decide they don't wanna be run off anymore. This is done in an enclosed area, so they can't run off. Basically they have the choice of coming to you or being chased.  **NO disrespect to round pens, I am just saying it does not have to be a small area. In the end, the horse becomes submissive to you. He gains your trust and then you can start training him.  It is suppose to easier after you "join up" to do things with him.    Monty Roberts article, about joining up. http://www.montyroberts.com/ju_about.htm...|`|vaulPrAmaa	join up is great - especially when you have a horse misbehaving or dis-trusting.  Lunge for a really long time at a trot or higher - the horse will try to stop but make it keep going.  one time, before it tries to stop, stop it yourself so that it's you giving the command, not the horse deciding when enough is enough.  bring him/her down do a walk and slowly pull in the line.  the horse should be panting and more than willing to come to you.  keep treats at hand so that you can reward him/her - always remember though - a scratch is a horse's best friend  =P|`|ej9IE5Csaa	Join-up can also be called building a relationship with your horse. I've found that riding your horse on trails can be a good way to join-up, or sit in their paddock with them while they eat so they can become used to your presence.   Another exercise is you could teach your horse showmanship, which is a type of ground work that makes you and your horse become more in-sink with each other ^-^
hlOawARXaa	Don't listen to the person who said it sounds like a brown recluse. Any spider bite or insect bite for that matter can swell up and become red and itchy. Put some cream on it to help with the itching and leave it alone for a day or two. If you want information on a brown recluse bite, I'll tell you a little bit. Some symptoms of a brown recluse bite are fever, chills, vomitting, restelessness, and severe pain. The bite from a BR is usually gray-blue or blue-white in coloring, and some say the markings will sometimes look like a bulls-eye. IF any of those symtoms occur you should seek medical treatment. Most people will not die from a BR if they get medical help, but the wound looks pretty bad if left untreated.|`|0YrSsKUmaa	:OO  i think that's a spider bite from a brown recluse|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	It sounds like a spider bite to me but I'm not doctor.  My last spider bite swelled up and was very painful for about a day.  They the swelling gradually went down along with the pain.  Check out the website I listed as my source.  If may provide you with the answers you seek.|`|3UUilV5vaa	perhaps a red ant bite?  My freiend freaked out too, with that same description, and found out it was a measly red ant bite..    Since spider bites sound more severe,  This little site i (lazily) looked up for you, talks about symptoms...check it out (in the source)|`|eDOPjk0Daa	Well have you been feeling woozy? Or has anything been wrong with you since the spider bite?  It depends on what happens to you if a black widow bit you, If your an older lady like older than 20 than the black widow bite can kill you. SO im sure its not black widow.  It seems to me thats its its a yellow sac spider.|`|OxOIhuXEaa	yea, it could be a spider bite.. but i'm not really sure, coz i'm allergic to mosquitoes anyway, so there's like no difference.    but if it hurts it's probably a spider one    or maybe sandfly? although those are big (like huge) they are like mosquito bites which just itch
F8m1VaoYaa	guppies like a ph of 7.0-8.5 ive keep guppies in lower ph  some will adapt to a lower ph,some wont the reason people have  told you not to mess around is if you go below ph 7.0  thats acidic and guppies really prefer alkaline water wich is   above ph 7.0 the 7.0 is neutral wich most fish can handle,thats  about the best i can do for you good luck.
TlhL0xFwaa	I would add a few more otos and corys, I have 3 and they are not as active as they were when they were 5-7. As for a colorful fish it is hard to give you a specific fish if you do not want tetras, guppys, mollies platies, swordtails or fish among those lines, the best I can give you is a goldfish, just one, he would do fine. I have a red-tail shark, goldfish, corys and a pleco, Everything goes along great in the tank. You can just get ideas online but to be sure ask the clerk or choose the fish yourself|`|AA11708471	more otos and a banded gourami|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I would add a few more otos, because they like to be in groups.     If you only want one more fish I would recommend a dwarf gourami.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	So if your tank if fully cycled and those are the only fish in there than they will be fine. The otto's eat almost all algae though so your gonna need to be buying algae tabs for them to eat. The Cory's on the other hand are meat eaters so they won't eat algae, you need a meaty bottom feeder food for them.     As far as a fish you want get a German Blue Ram. They are beautiful peaceful and won't harm plants or other fish. The only drawback is they are VERY sensitive to water quality so you need to keep up your water changes. Also you need to make sure your tank is fully cycled out and not just being set up. Even if it just finished cycling  you should still wait about a couple moths after you add the first fish to be sure the will acclimate well. The PH and Temp. for all the fish your getting will be between 6.5- 7.5 and stable (doesn't change) and 78-80 degrees and stable. A small piece of driftwood would be nice too.     Good Luck with everything.|`|hzxQMU0Caa	go with the 3 corys 2 otos that would be fin but the last fish i would put a silver hatchetfish.|`|ZhPlmL0Vaa	My concern is your statement that you don't want any of the smaller fish. A 20 gallon tank is not very big. At least half of the space in the tank should be used to provide the plants and hiding places needed by the fish to give them an environment that is like their natural habitat so they can live a stress free and healthy life. Almost all the fish sold in pet stores are juveniles and it is important to always find out how large your fish will be as adults. It is important to remember that fish are very territorial and will fight with each other if not given enough room.
I5Hm8CYVaa	Start your own thing. As frustrating as it may seem, you need to realize that charities, shelters, whatever are run just like any other business or bureaucracy. People are overworked, there is lots of paper work, there are procedures etc. If you're that passionate. really, start your own program.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	Try working with your local vet clinics..when the shelters wont take strays  (because they are full) the vet is forced to euthanize.. It happens very often, and vet clinics only have a small amount of employees and clients who are willing to foster. It is a good cause becasue the reason they are brought to the vet is because they are sick and or injured, but there is no owner who can take responsibility and authorize treatment or payment. Since you have a buisness, you are a lot more reputable than the average joe who says they want to help, but has no financial means in doing so.    besides, the vet staff will LOVE you if you offer coffee!!|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	It is not you.      Shelters are sometimes put off by offers of help because "volunteers" can sometimes become demanding and unreasonable.  Especially at a kill shelter.  You have to locate someone who is willing to work with volunteers and preferably have done that before.  Otherwise it is most likely doomed to fail.    The shelter I worked at (Animal Control) had many volunteers and a good relationship with the vet tech who was in charge of the volunteers.  After she left and we got a new vet tech.  He wanted nothing to do with the volunteers and their contributions.  Mind you we had a good 30 volunteers before he started.  He ran them all off.  They went to the humane society where they remain today.     You may try a humane society.  I definitely would not beg these people to take your money and volunteer time.  It will make you resentful in the end.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Well, if they don't want to your help, that's their own fault. Look elsewhere- Im sure somewhere would be glad. Don't waste your time and money on shelters who dont appreciate you. You tried, but now move on.     Try smaller shelters, those in the country or more rural areas. Where they are not well known, dont have a rich sponsor or two. They would prolly be more ready to accept such a gift as the one you are offering.|`|p9A61dFgaa	You sound like a great guy. Their hard to get hold of I work a one in N.Ireland and its Crosskennan Lane Animal sanctuary. Getting time to do anything other than work is near impossible. Turn up at the place with a booklet of your information and what you want to do, with a camera. You've got to keep at them, remember your helping the animals it's not their fault the people aren't great with you. Their animal people we're never good with people or time.

znGpjsGjaa	It is not the grains causing the gas it is the fruits and vegetables.  Young rabbits should not be fed fresh foods until they are over 5 months old, and then only as an occasional treat.    Stick to a good complete rabbit pellet, hay and fresh water. Rabbits can have a small amount of grains mixed in with their pellets but it should not make up a large portion of the diet.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Do not feed him the multi-grain mix.  The rabbit pellets are fine, but make sure they are a formula appropriate to your breed (for instance a Holland Lop needs a mix with 15%-16% protein, but no more, no less).  Rabbits cannot digest carbohydrates properly and so you shouldn't feed it the grains.  I couldn't say whether it is the grain that is causing the issue, though.  You should also give your rabbit an unlimited supply of timothy hay.  Fresh fruits and veggies, including leafy greens are a good dietary supplement. (Except for Lops, leafy greens give them diarrhea)    To help regulate your rabbit's digestion, you could feed him some oats.  They love oats and they are really could for them.  Just make sure they are the old-fashioned kind and not quick-oats.

c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	No. The lamp acts like the sun for them. After swimming, the heat from the lamp kills the germs and bacteria that could be harmful for the shell. Look up turtle basking on google to get more information.|`|McjaM0hDaa	NO IT CANT!!!!  pleaz do not kill the turtle, i have a turtle and it needs it trust ME!!!!!!! so go get lights you need a heat lamp and a light lamp. or sell them.|`|0QAyPPeoaa	when i saw them at the pet store they didnt have lamps?|`|i98X99Q8aa	I don't think so.|`|2r5yq35paa	If you dont have a lamp for it, you need to give it lots of sunshine or anytype or UV light. If they don't get the nutrients they need, they can get sick and have dieseases.|`|3BVDSwgNaa	Yes your turtle needs a UV light.  It simulates the sun and allows them to metabolize their food.   Sunlight through a window will not work because the glass diffuses the UV rays. They have to be changed out about every 6mos or so because they will loose their effectiveness even though the light will come on.    If you can't afford a light, can you take him outside everyday to soak up some rays?     Good luck!|`|69fb08854a4e77f2b45550c526754d26aa	I think they need heat lamps..

ALSO always wash your hands after touching your turtle as they can carry salmonilla.|`|7m1SJZHkaa	THE TURTLE NEEDS A LAMP THERE REALLY CHEAP AND HE CAN NOT LIVE HAPPILY WITHOUT IT! IF U DO NOT HAVE A LAMP U DO NOT HAVE A TURTLE HE IS A COLD BLOODED CREATURE!!!!!!!!!!|`|kZWKdPtOaa	You know this reminds me of Franklin. My all time favorite cartoon ever!!!  Well yes a lamp should be used for the turtle. The turtle needs to be at a certain temperature. If to cold it can die if to hot it will die.     Turtle Duty:      *  Make sure your turtle's water is at about 26 degrees CELSIUS/ 79 degrees FAHRENHEIT.      * Make sure your turtle has an artificial UVA/B light or natural sunlight.      * Make sure your turtle has a basking area out of the water heated by a Tungsten basking lamp.      * In Winter, have a glass lid covering the basking area of your turtles enclosure.     Heat - Keeping your turtle warm enough without cooking it is the name of the game. Look into the specific needs of your turtle and set up a tank heater to maintain an appropriate temperature for your animal. This is the single most frequent reason that turtles die of neglect. Many turtles simply don't do well at room temperature, day after day. A turtle kept at sub-optimal temperatures will stop eating, and eventually, it will die. Make sure to use a standard aquarium thermometer to check the settings on your heater, as the heat-selector on these heaters can be inaccurate. Some people find it helpful to vary the temperature slightly seasonally, to better replicate natural temperature changes in nature. My turtles have been living at the same temperature year-round for many years, and they don't complain!     I hope I helped :D|`|xBxAD5NZaa	no.|`|RKSabTNMaa	no they need it for warmth and vitamin d|`|RxJzvUu7aa	i think it depends on what kind of turtle, you should figure it out before its dead though.
fOLO4TNhaa	My Chihuahua is the sweetest thing in the world. I could bring him around infants with out a worry in mind. He wouldn't harm a fly. The Chihuahua is the best breed i have EVER owned.    Although for the dogs safety i wouldn't leave ANY child with my chihuahua. Chihuahuas are fare to fragile and could be hurt.|`|qEOJzbJraa	I wouldn't reccomend it.     Small children tend to be bouncy and off the wall since they're young and they could easily hurt the dog due that behavoir causing the dog to nip or bite.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Bad Idea.  Small children and small dogs do not mix well.  The dogs are too fragile and the children are too rough to handle this small of a dog.  You would do better getting a medium to larger size dog if you need to get one at this time.  I'd suggest waiting until your son is older and can be taught the proper handling and care of a pet.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Bad idea.    If it's not a well-bred (or rescue) Chihuahua, it will most likely be nervous and more prone to attacks. It may be anyway.    Even if it was the sweetest thing, Chihuahuas are very delicate, and a small child could do them serious harm.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	You would have to bring your son with you to meet the dog. My chihuahua doesn't like children, however he is extremly gentle and affectionate with my 3 yr old daughter. That being said, she is very gentle and respectful to him. So it really all depends, but in general Chihuahuas are fragile and not reccomended for children.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Make sure you meet the parents of the dog to see the temperament if the breeds won't let you see them then there's more than likely a problem and I wouldn't suggest that dog also if it's from a pet store there's a good chance they could be from puppy mills which is a very bad idea and I wouldn't recommend it. Also is your son aware of how he should act around animals? If he gives it its space and isn't rough with the dog I think it should be fine but make sure you supervise them when they are together at all times.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	LOL I love how people say it is a bad idea UNLESS it is a resuce as if rescues mean they are good well adjusted dogs. I would ask the owners if this dog has been around children and animals. Take you child over to visit with the dog for a few times first.See how it acts around your little one first. If it seems too nurvous maybe get a yunger pup to grow up with your son.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Depends on the dog.    I have a chi that just loves kids!  However, I know a lot other ones that don't.  It all depends on how they were raised.|`|52otNiElaa	At first it might be the chihuaha who's dangerous but then its gonna be the small children who become dangerous to the dog. Keep her.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Personally I think it's a bad combo.  Chihuahuas are unbelievably fragile - it would take very little rough play for a two-year old to seriously injure one.  There are tons of chihuahuas in shelters all the time - more than 50 at a time in my area.  Wait till your son is older and understands enough not to play roughly.|`|RDcwT7YEaa	I would Research chihuahuas and find out about their temperament. Why are they getting rid of an 8 month old dog did someone return her and why. You can also tell a lot by the conditions in which the dog is being kept when you went to see her. If you do decide she is the one you want introduce the child and dog slowly always under your supervision.|`|uERNim0yaa	Such a bad idea....  Small dogs + small children = injured dogs and/or bitten children.  Whenever I hear of a child that was bitten by a dog, I place the blame on the parents, for not protecting and teaching their children better, and the dog owner, for not protecting their dog.  Your son will want to play with the puppy.  Think of how much fun that "toy" is!  It moves, and barks...  But if your son gets his hands on her for just a second, he could hurt her.  She will bite to try to get away from him.  You cannot watch your son every second.  Wait until your son is a little older to get a puppy and let your son help pick it out.
OdDbR4Psaa	Show bettas are quality bettas that are usually worth a couple hundred dollars and you usually don't find them in pet stores, even if they look nice. Most are from top breeders who breed top quality bettas, which are raised specifically for competitions when they're very young. But there's no hurt in trying, right?      I'm not sure about the competitions, but you can probably search it up on Google if there are any. Also visit the International Betta Congress for more information about show bettas and competitions:    http://www.ibcbettas.org/|`|dwA4bwlraa	Uhh you said no one is answering this and i understand why.

KEYgd73saa	Most schooling fish are, unfortunately, not that personable.  In fact, they school largely because they aren't intelligent enough to avoid predation by other means.  I'd suggest you start by getting rid of the Opaline Gourami, as it will likely bother most schooling fish.  Rasboras are very tight schoolers-- much tighter than Tetras-- and would be my first choice (I just bought a school of Rasbora borapetensis).  If you don't like Harlequins (they're gorgeous once they calm down in your tank), look for just about any other species.  Scissortail Rasboras are incredible, but you may find they would do better in your 80 gallon tank as they grow.  For color, it's hard to beat Neon Tetras, but they are very fragile and tend to go their own way unless you've got about 8+ of them (which I'd recommend).  Cherry Barbs don't really school, but they are sociable and very fun compared to Tetras and their flock mentality.|`|rzggIaPNaa	I have the same scenario as you except i dont have a bigger tank upstairs. Any type of tetras are good schooling fish. There is a variety of colors and patterns and you have to buy at least 3. I have several types of tetras in my tank and they all school.

7DSqxCuAaa	If you have a breeding pair,they are one of the most aggressive there is.Mine will bite my hand if I put it in their tank when they have fry.If you just have a single,they are territorial,and will become aggressive if another fish comes into their territory.They should be kept with other large South or Central American cichlids.Even though they do not get as large as some,they will hold their own with the biggest of them.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	About middle of the road. There are many cichlids that are more agressive, and many that are less.    Agression depends what you are comparing them with and as there are so many different ciclids it's hard to answer.    Ian|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha ...  Oh, wait, maybe you're serious.  Convicts are sort of normal cichlids when they're not breeding, but when they get ready to spawn, and then when they are guarding eggs or fry, they can keep other aggressive fish many times their size at bay. They are the wolverines of the cichlid family.
6j4igZ9Haa	If the mini knows how to lunge then he'll know the routine without you having to do much. Once you've sent him out away from you and onto his circle you'll have to try and keep am imaginary triangle shape going from his point of shoulder to you and back to his hind quarters(If you have a lunge whip). As he's going round you should be walking round on your own smaller circle but keeping your body facing his. You should be slightly behind his shoulder line so you can keep driving him forward, getting in front of him or level with his eyeline could cause him to stop or change direction. Voice commands are usually used, it can help to say the horses name before each command to make sure you have it's attention too. Holding the lunge line, please don't wrap anything round your hands or legs lol. I wouldn't lunge the horse over jumps if you've never lunged before, it can get difficult, maybe just let the more experienced person do that bit til you get the hang of it but lunging on it's own should be enough to help get that extra weight off your horse. I'll be doing the same soon with my little fatty devil! Hope you have fun|`|vaulPrAmaa	don't get ahead of yourself - don't jump, or even canter on lunge till you get walk/trot perfect.  look at it's butt, keep the rope hand out, use words, not sounds, and keep your body in front of the horse.  make sure an adult who knows how to lunge is there - poor lunging can ruin a horse forever!!|`|d7cCWJCoaa	You've never lunged, correct?  Has the mini ever been lunged before?    If the mini has been lunged, go ahead and do it with the help of someone experienced with lunging standing beside you. You want to make a triangle- one side is the lunge line, one side is the whip, and one side is the horse. Does that make sense? You want to stand just behind the horse's shoulder and keep the whip passive (on the ground) behind them, until it is needed.  There's more to it than that, and it's difficult to teach everything online, hence the need for someone more experienced to help you.  Also, if the horse is chubby and out of shape, don't lunge him for too long (under 10min) or too hard (mostly trotting, maybe a bit of cantering).  You can work up to jumping over a couple of weeks.  Also, lunging shouldn't solely be used to keep a horse in shape. It's much better used as a training tool. I would say only lunge a maximum of twice a week.|`|ngo1pmlGaa	k...when your lunging you have to picture a triangle (stay behind your pony's shoulder, and if you are gonna have a lunge whip then keep it out in front of you so he knows its there) and my instructor tought me that i should'nt crack the whip because it could create a fear of the whip but your instructor might have you crack it (everyone in tought differently) and try your best to stay in one place. If you pony is'nt trained to lunge then he may try to come into where you are standing, if he does, DONT back up, whatever you do just dont, this can teach teach him to take advantage of you. hope this was the answer you were looking for!
7DSqxCuAaa	Stop feeding guppies.  Try frozen beef heart,frozen shrimp,and frozen blood worms.I would also try to find some sinking pellets.There are sinking cichlid pellets,and there are also sinking shrimp pellets you could try as well.  Guppies offer almost no nutritional value,and may introduce a disease into your tank and fish.When it gets hungry,it will eat.Just be patient,and stop feeding it guppies.The guppies really will not help in its growth anyway.A good variety of frozen and pellet food will.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Yep - dont give him any guppies.

AA10717561	Try a product called MTG mane tail groom rub it in his tail from top to bottom my horse will be three and his tail touches the ground thanks to this product|`|AA10986942	Make sure your horse is on a good deworming program first.  They tend to rub their tails if they have pin worms because their butt is itchie which will break the top hairs off.  After deworming every 6 weeks, you should be washing and conditioning the tail every week because a dirty tail is also itchie....  Nothing is going to make it grow faster.... people say things will but nothing makes hair grow faster, if it did ladies would be doing it too....  you can put conditioners on it and make sure you have good nutrition for your horse to make the hair stronger and less brittle.  you can protect it from breaking off by braiding (only below the tail bone!) it and putting it in a tail bag (to protect the braid from getting caught on something and ripping out the hair)  Do not braid or knot the hair above the bottom of the tail bone because this can pull hairs out or irritate the horse and make him rub!  It taks a long time... years to grow a beautiful tail.  Some horses have naturally thick long tails and some have very thin ... just like people.  For showing buy a fake tail.. pretty cheap around $125.00 and just braid it in, looks great and if you do it right no one will know. Everyone does it in AQHA|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	No on the shampoo. Best bet would be to rub in Vitamin E into the top of the tail...every day. Also heard green tea will work too. Hope this helps.|`|fUEh0zS1aa	you could condition the tail up where the short hairs are    and, while it wont happen instantly, over time horse shampoo and conditioner will make your hair healthy and strong thus making it longer :) and shiny|`|ej9IE5Csaa	Well this is what I've always done and I had a horse once with a tail that would make any women purr!   To make your horses tail even and equally thick takes time and hard work.   Cut your horses tail around the Hock area. YES this sounds horrible! BUT, hear me out! After you've done this you will notice that the tail is thicker because the shorter hairs of the tail can now make it fuller. Wash your horses tail with Mane and Tail Shampoo and Conditioner once a week, and let it grow evenly. Continue to cut it but not at the hocks any more but in small increments. This should make your horses tail long, thick and healthy ^-^, Braid tail dry and put in tail bag for best results.
iJtuhLMTaa	Really nothing and a  5 gal tank is really much to small for it.  They get over 6" long.    CEA can get quite aggressive with any other type of fish when it matures and will attack the slim coats of any other fish it is housed with.      If you want to keep your CAE he really needs to be in a 20 gal minimum tank by himself|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	ANY KIND OF GOLDFISH WOULD, but a 5 gallon is way to small consider a bigger tank
ak9DrBSwaa	Is that a Syrian (teddy bear)?     That cage is REALLY little. When looking for a new cage, please remember that continuous horizontal space is important. You want the largest amount of floor space on a single level. Hamsters are NOT tree climbers, so those cages that loook like bird cages with several little shelves are not useful to your pet. They also have poor eyesite and will all and get hurt from these poorly designed cages. Look into a 20 g long aquarium or bin cage for a better housing situation for your pet. Guinea pig cages also work, but you have to look hard to find one with bars spaced close enough together so that your hamster wont squeeze through.      Be sure to consider her adult size.     The tubes with the bubble design are very narrow on the inside. Many Syrians often become stuck in them as adults. HARTZ brand tubes have the largest inside diameter and would be safer for a syrian, but you still need to watch how big your pet grows.     That wheel also looks too small - be sure to replace it with one that will allow her to run without bending her back.    In the mean time, it looks like that wheel is the type the clips on the side of the cage. Raise it up some, so that she gains a little bit of room underneath it to hide. She'll still be able to climb onto it if you don't raise it too much.|`|Km6gOd61aa	Actually that's an ok size cage but anyway. I would suggest moving the panel to the other side of the cage and put the wheel above it. Then buy some chew toys or or those little chewable home things. Also, if you wanted to if you've ever seen those little plastic living room sets they have at petco and petsmart like these    http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    well something like that, it's a bigger set.    That's what I would suggest|`|v3dN1sSaaa	well you could get some chew toys and your hamsters needs somewhere where it can sleep and fill that with bedding not shavings or whatever your using, and maybe some tunnels and just some chew blocks and a mineral stone and your hamster will be happy|`|jibEAR7iaa	I suggest getting her a wheel if she doesn't already have one, they're fun and good exercise. Also a lot of people warn against using pine or cedar chips, since there are reports of them being toxic. Some people like using a paper based litter. I prefer a strait sheet of synthetic lambs wool. You can get it at walmart, just cut it to the size of the cage. When it gets dirty throw it in the wash, its easier than all those chips.

qdtU1Q1Laa	Closed front boots also known as splint/galloping boots are usually used for everyday flatwork, cross country, and beginning jumping. Open front boots are used by jumpers as the open front teaches the horse that is uncomfortable to hit rails. I do jumpers, but I'm fairly sure that you are not allowed to use boots in hunters. I prefer the hard shell open fronts to the leather ones as they're more durable, show a lot less wear, and are a lot easier to clean.     Splint boot  good-  cheap  you can get them in almost any color  are good all around boots  can be used on the hind legs as well  *there really are no bad things about them*    Open front boots  good-  more durable than splint boots [[ well at least they have been for me ]]  more protective  offer more support  bad-  expensive|`|y8HyP1bzaa	For hunters, you cannot show in boots.    A lot of jumpers use open front boots.    Personally, I use closed boots because I event.  I want my horse's legs to be as protected as they possibly can for cross country.|`|jQvT6k7raa	Well, the closed front boots are great for horses with sensitive legs, but if he hits the rail, he may not even notice.  With the open front design, he gets all of the support of the closed front, and can still feel impact when he hits a rail.  So unless your horse has highly sensitive or frail legs (in which case she may not be suitable for jumping in the first place), I'd go with the open front boots. As for hard shell or leather, I personally prefer leather. while they don't wear as well, they look sooo much more classy, and are best for the show ring.  I hope I helped!
vwEnKqZ6aa	The average lifespan for beardies is around 10 to 15 years with proper care. Although there hav been sum that lived 20+ years. I agree with the person above me.

w1lh1INHaa	She is telling them it is time to grow up, go out, get a job and leave her alone.      I'm not sure why the three month old kittens get preference over a Queen that has gone through hell giving birth to them, but that isn't fair (and with today's overcrowded shelters, she'll probably be put down).    There are products from Feliway that are great for helping create a harmonious atmosphere in the cat household.      Otherwise, you need to separate the kittens from mama, and make sure mama knows she is loved.  Once the kittens get older and stop pestering her, she'll be much better with them.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	She's telling them that she's done with them and it's time for them to go out on their own, especially if they are still trying to nurse on her.

Almost all mother cats do this, it's not uncommon.|`|zeTGmB3faa	You don't need to get rid of her. This is natural. They are now raised and she is telling them to stay away, no more nursing and letting them know that they are on their own. Cats don't form maternal life long bonds with their offspring.

If the mother cat was bought as an adult or adopted as a stray, then they will tend to have territorial behavior. The general weaning period for kittens is two and a half months minimum, some times 4 months if the mother cat is very robust. Until then, the cat will care for all the kitten's needs. However, once the grow older and begin to release different hormones, in the outdoor world they will usually fine a general area of territory for themselves. At this point, the mother cat will shoo them away as a threat to her territory. Keep in mind it is extremely rare for soft breed domestic cats to do this. So if your cat was adopted off the streets then this is normal. The best solution is to either give the kittens away, or give away the mother. If you keep the kittens and they grow up together in the house they will be considered soft breeds and will not have territorial issues.|`|zBvKemqAaa	Sometimes mother cats after weening their kittens at 6 to 7 weeks need their space and will want to separate from them.  This is a biological fact with mother cats.  There are some exceptions to this, some mother cats may just accept their post weened kittens as housemates and tolerate them.  Sometimes, you may need to have her spayed to remove the aggressive behavior.  Most mother cats after weening a litter biologically change in preparation for being sired again and having future litters.  Please consider getting her spayed--there are way too many unwanted kittens in this world...believe me I help at a very busy humane society shelter in the cattery  here in Atlanta, Georgia.  I see it almost every day.|`|I5Hm8CYVaa	Don't get rid of her. It's completely natural. She is probably weening them, their teeth hurt her and she wants them to stop. It's also a way to get them to grow up and get on with themselves. Get her spayed.|`|5a30eb5b89b12b5040c830a843bda7d6aa	Mama cat is tired of her babies.  Chances are that the babies are still trying to nurse and Mama cat is moving on.  She is being governed by her hormones.    She no longer has the correct level of ocytoxin to be bothered.    It is time for you to find homes for those babies or at least separate her from them for periods of time so that she can have a break!

aP4bkYOCaa	Either breed can have awful health issues, but only if they're bred by people who did not test the parent animals for genetic health issues.    Both Irish Setters and Alaskan Malamutes can suffer from bad elbows and bad hips, among other expensive hereditary conditions.    However, if you're in love with one of these breeds, the best thing to do would be to visit either parent breed club:    http://www.alaskanmalamute.org/wiki/defa...  http://www.irishsetterclub.org/    And research breeders. Good breeders that show and work their stock generally test for genetic health abnormalities and do not breed dogs that have such problems. The chances of purchasing a healthy puppy are much higher than if you were to buy a puppy from someone who just threw two dogs together. Best of all, if your puppy does infact develop a problem later on in life, you can count on a good breeder to refund your purchase price, or atleast part of it.    Best of luck!!|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Research your breeders...that is the best thing you can do to help guarantee a healthy well bred puppy.  Check that they "do" breed type activities with their dogs (showing, agility, obedience trials, etc) make sure they do the proper health and genetic screening of their breeding dogs to ensure healthy quality offspring.  Just some of the things to be aware of.|`|6iPDaG1vaa	seriously just get a rescue from your local animal shelter. all purebreds are actually inbred, so they have TONS of health problems. i say this from experience. my family has a west highland terrier. she has jaw problems (common in breed) but guess what else happened. when she was five, yes five, she had a stroke, out of the blue, no harm was done to her. she wasn't climbing on the the playground out back, or jumping up to catch a frisbee. we had no clue what happened, we took her to the vet, and they did 10,000 worth of diagnosis to tell us by process of elimination that it was most likely a stroke and there was nothing we could do except give her physical therapy at home. we did, and she got most of her back legs' use back, and then ANOTHER stroke, two years later. we knew what it was so we didn't end up spending another 10,000. and when it happened the first time they tested anything to get us to pay more, spinal meningitis, lime disease, slipped disk, etc. and she can't tell when she has to use the bathroom. so we have to squeeze her to get her to pee, and she just poos all of the sudden in the house and we have to clean it up. as you can see purebreds have soooo many problems. just get a dog from the pound, a cute mix breed, they are much hardier, just as loving and less expensive. and they are in more need for a home

JwYwsrTzaa	I don't think smacking a dog is a good form of training.    The best form of training is to constantly be around your dog and correct them when they do something you don't approve of. You can correct a dog by telling them no, nudge them (like the Cesar Millan) or removing them from the situation. Never by hitting. Hitting your dog will cause him to fear you and fear could cause bitting.    Once they respect that you make the rules, they will understand what you want and don't want from them. Which in the end, will make a happy and well-trained dog. :)|`|RUf73hG1aa	Dogs don't understand that kind of punishment.  My dog goes in a time out area when he is being bad.|`|wB8bK0vFaa	If you don't seriously hit him, he won't.

Dog's don't understand that sort of punishment. But i do agree there has to be a level of discipline.  If he does something wrong, raising your voice actually very affective. Also theres always a time out. The dog is your family, basiclly your child.  If he licks you that's most likely indicates that they are sorry.   If you hit a dog, your dog is less loyal, and doesn't trust you as well.  as for your dog running away, try coming with a treat and a smile and be very nice until the dog comes out of its phase. It may be serious though, most likely not, and i don't mean to scare you, but if it continues for a few months[that sounds like a while but] take him to a vet. You may need other professional help.  Also, keep in mind that your dog is like your family. They look up to you. You are their hero. [unless its abusive, which I'm sure it isn't] Think about if you spend you're whole life, living with only a few people. Dog is a man's best friend, and you should treat them as one.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	There was a Proverb dating from Shakespeare's time that went. "A woman, a dog and a walnut tree, the more you beat them the better they be."    It was true with regard to walnut trees.    Unfortunately dogs are loyal and forgiving, and he probably won't hate you (although people like me might).  Your dog doesn't deserve this treatment, dogs are basically good and eager to please - if the dog is not doing what you want, then it is your fault because you have failed to explain to him what you want. Sometimes doing that can be difficult, but once a dog understands what you want he will generally try to do that for you. Try - gently and without making him anxious or scared -  to get him to understand. Give it time.     Dogs are pretty damn special. There was a bumper sticker from the eighties that read "Try to be as good a person as your dog thinks that you are." More people should heed that suggestion.|`|pUaGFbzaaa	yes it will fear you and hate you so yeah don't do it
KEYgd73saa	Core got it.  Septicemia is just about the only thing that explains the red streaks (which are hemorrhaging) and why some aren't eating.  End the Parasite Clear immediately, do a large water change, and run activated carbon overnight (to fully remove the medication).  Take the activated carbon out tomorrow morning and start a regimen of Furan 2, Maracyn 2, Fungus Clear, Fungus Clear (both very effective against bacteria), Furanase, Triple Sulfa, Trisulfa, or metronidazole based meds (Metronidazole, Fish Zole, Flagyl, Aquazole, Hexamit, Hex-Out, Metro+, etc.).  Clean water often stops the progression of minor septic infections, but this is more severe and needs antibiotics as soon as possible.

If it's on the covers over the gills and along the front edges of the fins, all this means is that you have a male. Males get spots in these locations that look like pimples when they're in spawning condition. To see a photo of these, see this link: http://www.bristol-aquarists.org.uk/gold...    If your goldfish is an oranda, lionhead, ranchu, or variety that has a cap (looks like bubbles at the top of the head), white on the cap is a new point of growth. Rule these out before you decide your fish has a disease it may actually not have!    If the spots are anywhere else on the body, it may be a parasite (ich). You can treat this by raising the water temperature and using salt. It's best to use salt without iodine in it if you have or can get some - rock, kosher, canning, or pickling salt are all okay. Add one tablespoon for every gallon of water that your fish is in. You can read more about ich here: http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/he...    If your fish is opening and closing it's mouth, it might be hungry, if it's only doing this when you're nearby. If it does this even when it can't see you, it probably has another cause. Usually this can be from not enough oxygen in the water (if you don't have a filter or airstone to move the water around), or it may be that there is too much ammonia or nitrite in the water. The ammonia comes from the fish wastes (poop) or uneaten food. Normally, if the fish is in a tank, there will eventually be bacteria that convert the ammonia to nitrite, then to nitrate. Both ammonia and nitrite are toxic to fish, and it keeps them from being able to get enough oxygen, so they look like they're gasping for air. You can help your fish by doing frequent water changes for him. If he's in a tank, you should only need to change about 25% of the water once or twice a week. If it's in a bowl withough a filter, it should have a complete water change 2-3 times a week. It also helps if you don't overfeed your fish - only give him what he can eat in 2-3 minnutes two times each day. Also, if it is in a bowl, you should know that goldfish can get close to 2 feet long, although in anything less than a pond, 10-18 inches is more common.|`|KrdOKdJcaa	Watch their swimming patterns.

It usually starts out on the fins/tails then gradually progresses to the body of the fish.  If your goldfish is over 2 years old though, males will get white spots on their gill plates and that area, these are breeding tubernacles(sp), meaning he's ready to start spawning with a female.  You can tell the difference by what I said, ich will usually start on the fins/tail and spread.  If it's  a breeding male-those white spots will only stay on the gill plate area.    You won't necessarily see torn fins, clamped fins, or a poor appetite.  At least, not right off the bat anyway.  Here's some good links for info on ich-what it is, causes, and treatments:    http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichthyophth...

r18PoGJiaa	There are poisonous chemicals that they treat the gravel with. It would be deadly to the fish. The little fellow will be ok until you can save up for some gravel.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	"Street" gravel?  Like something you'd pick up from the street?    No. It would probably have asphalt or tar and who-knows-what-else on it.    But you don't have to have gravel in a fish bowl or tank. You can just keep the bottom bare.    If you don't have enough money for a small sack of gravel, though, I don't see how you'll manage to provide for the needs of a fish, or any other animal, though.|`|4qAXe76Qaa	"Unfortunately no. Using plane old street gravel inside a fish tank is dangerous unless you know how to clean it properly.

It is actually common.  In fact the behavior has been found in every hooved species yet studied.  It has also been seen in all the primate species and even carnivores.      As far as the behavior, do not allow it.  Punish her when she tries.  Use a whip on her shins.  Be quick about it.    Check and see if your vet can do a vaginal spaying without opening her up.  If he has the equipment and knowledge the price should be around $150.|`|jQvT6k7raa	I've never heard of it, but it's obviously VERY dangerous! I don't think she REALLY believes she is a stallion, but rather that she is the leader. Therefore, she is taking on her role as the dominant horse in your "herd" of two, in a very unusual way. I believe that the problem is quite simply she doesn't see you as alpha, and she doesn't respect you. She see's her self as the leader (in the wild, this hore would be the stallion) and you are "her mare" you are her's to command. While it could be she has a rare hormone disorder, or something along those lines, witch you should ask your vet about, I honestly believe it can be remedied with a little training.    First thing, you may not baby her. Not that you can't love her, you certainly can, but you may not let her crowd you, rub on you, or let her choose when it's time for a cuddle. You have to get her to under stand you have a personal bubble witch she is not to crowd. You can invite her in, but she may not wander in of her own accord.  This also mean you should stop hand feeding treats. I know she deserves them, and she can still have them, but not from your hand After a ride, let her pick them up off the ground, or put the in her feeder. If the treats come from you, she learns that she can nudge you push you around, and crowd you looking for the yummy tidbits.    The second thing I suggest is joining up. Essentially, this is free lunging. You free lunge, keeping her above a walk until she decides she sick of it, and submits to you. when she drops her head, or starts chewing, you let her stop, turn around, relax your shoulders, drop your head and arms in non-threatening way, and wait. if she walks to you, take a few steps. she will follow. you have joined-up! she has said "OK, OK, you are the boss, I would rather be your friend than work my buns off!" if she doesn't come in 30 seconds, get her going until she submits again. You will need to do this a few times before she gets the message.  Best of luck in all things horsey!|`|3YHZUuhyaa	That seems very unusual. Next time she does it, give her a firm "No!", slap her on the shoulder (not hard, just enough to get her attention) and back her up.     It sounds like a dominance thing. I've seen female cows and goats do that to eachother but i don't know if its the same with horses.     i hope this helps! good luck!|`|6j4igZ9Haa	A friend of mine had a paint mare a while back, she would have been around the same age 5yo. She was very hard to handle at times, tried mounting the other mares in the field like a stallion would to the point we had to separate her, if I remember right she did it with some geldings too before we moved her into isolation for her own safety. Turned out she was hormonally imbalanced. She never tried to mount a person though lol. I have heard of some stallions trying to mount a person when they had the scent of a mare on them or if it was 'that time of month' for women, it can be dangerous. Your horses behavior just can't be let to continue. I would ask a vet to check the hormone levels or what ever they thought could be causing the behavior. Personally I wouldn't be keeping a single mare with a herd of geldings, it's just not natural. Try and get her some female company or maybe section a part off and have just one gelding if any for company. Being vocal is quite normal, some horses are and some aren't, even with people.|`|XsBIITFvaa	I would have her hormone level checked. I've never seen a mare act like that, but I'm sure it's not like it's never happened before. Maybe her hormone level is sky rocketing and because she's the last on the todum pole, she takes this behavior out on humans. Have your vet check her first, but I know they have hormone regulators. I knew a mare who was in season 24/7 and had to get a dose of hormone regulators in her feed twice a day, or else she was uncontrollable.     I don't think she's trying to show dominace, but this could be it. I wouldn't think that she would go to that extremes with humans, but you never know. I've heard of gelding trying to mount people to show their dominance. (not because the people were on their period either.) But this sounds like a good question for your vet. I find it very interesting, though I'm sure it was terrifying for you. If you do have your vet or a behaviorist come out and evaluate her, please email me and let me know what they said.|`|uF0guMdJaa	You need to call a vet a possibly get her "horse-spayed."|`|FcR8G8hPaa	This is probably not as weird as it seems and is almost certainly not sexual.    Foals (even grown horses) will sometimes rear up and drape their forelegs over the neck, shoulders or back of a horse who is a parent or is otherwise close to them. I observed this one night when I returned a horse to a pen she shared with her daughter and it's a memory I'll never forget.    Also, my horse, a gelding, attempted to do this as I was walking away from him. I immediately and harshly chased him back and since then have been very careful about personal space when working with him.    A horse needs to understand that you can enter its personal space whenever you want, but that the horse cannot enter your personal space without an invitation.    As for the horse calling out and nickering, she's probably bonded with you and looks forward to seeing you. Nothing wrong with that and certainly nothing sexual.    So you're going to have to be a little cold hearted for a while for both of your good. She can still get affection from you, but you must limit how she can return it.    I hope this helps!
sbB0TpGXaa	Some horses do this.  Some people have joints that pop too.  I know I sure do!  If she shows no sign of discomfort there is no need to worry.  I would feed glucoseamine/chondritin.  It seems to help the popping in my joints.  But as far as worrying there is no need to worry unless she exhibits signs of lameness.

MSM is inexpensive and a good place to start with joint supplementation.  My 23 year old mare has improved joint flexibility since she has been having it added to her feed.
NBfBKI1Uaa	Before adding the fishes, did you cycle the tank? If you didn't, it is natural to have high ammonia content since the tank haven't developed a beneficial bcateria colony to convert the ammonia to nitrates.    If you cycled the tank, and you have a spike in ammonia and nitrates at the same time, then your beneficial bacteria cannot handle the bioload you introduced. It will take time for the tank to develop a larger beneficial bacteria colony that can handle the bioload.     Till then simply keep doing water changes to keep the ammonia level to a minimum.    -rds|`|qeOlkRM0aa	How old is the tank? You are going to have to let the tank cycle naturally. The cloudiness is  bacteria consuming the ammonia and nitrites. ease up on the food|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Too many fish added at once.  The bacteria couldn't keep up with the extra bioload from the fish.      Also, using those ammo lock types of product does not remove the ammonia, not sure on that particular product, but usually they just bind the ammonia or convert it to a nontoxic form.  You will still get a "false positive" on your ammonia test.      Is this a newly set up tank as well?  If so, doesn't sound like it's cycled....see link for more info on that:    http://freshaquarium.about.com/cs/biolog...    And if that's the case, those fish are not proper fish to use to cycle a tank.  They most likely won't make it through it.  The only thing, I don't understand why your nitrates are high if it is newly set up.  That tells me, either your test kit is bad, or you're on well water that naturally has high nitrate levels...which will cause problems as well.  For now, daily partial water changes to help dilute the toxins, and I would recommend using Prime by Seachem instead of Ammo Lock.      Arowana will need a much larger tank, and not sure on the stingray  but I'm guessing it will as well.  Maybe you should consider returning the fish, do a fishless cycle on the tank, and get fish more suitable for your tank size.  Just my opinion though....Good luck!|`|gwDftPBsaa	Ok the reason why you have an ammonia spike is because of your stingray. Stingrays relase large amounts of ammonia due to their osmoregulatory system. They area also very sensitive to their water parameter, so your in a really bad situation. A 75 gallon tank is considered borderline in terms of a grow out tank because of there large amount of ammonia they release. A 125 is recommened as a beginner tank. I suggest you either get rid of the ray or consider doing around 50%-75% water change a day or every other day. I would also upgrade to a bigger tank for a growout. The high nitrate is because some of the ammoia is convering to nitrate.|`|7DSqxCuAaa	A 75 gallon with an Arowana,stingray,and 2 Plecos is overstocked.An Arowana needs at least 300 gallons,no matter what it's size is now.2 common Plecos need at least 120 gallons.1 stingray needs 120gallons by itself.  What are your ammonia,nitrite and nitrate levels?  Stop adding ammonia lock and use Prime or Amquel Plus instead.  It sounds like you did not cycle your tank before adding your fish.Here is a link on how the nitrogen cycle works,and how to cycle your tank with fish in it.  http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/aquarium...  I would get rid of all the fish you have right now,do a fishless cycle,and then go from there.Research the fish before you buy them.75 gallons really isn't that big of a tank,and if you want to keep large fish,your choices are limited.Here is a link on fishless cycling.  http://www.aquaticcommunity.com/aquarium...

AA11565057	Hmmmm...  When I wanted to work on my balance and seat, my instructor got my horse in a round yard with a lunge whip. She took away my stirrups and reins and asked me to keep my arms crossed. We then went through the gaits - first walking, then a slow trot, then a faster trot (sitting both of them) and a slow canter. Then the pace increased and she asked my horse to turn quickly. All of this time, it was a highly controlled environment and I had no choice but to use my legs and my seat and balance correctly.   It was quite scary, but my balance improved immensely. It's also good if you're a little worried about controlling your horse. You don't have to with the instructor there doing that work. You can just focus on your balance.    When doing that, she had my horse turning so fast it had to rear up a little to do it (very nimble horse, I barrel raced with it sometimes!). I came off after a good half hour, but it was worth it, and the footing was nice and soft.    What do you think? If you can trot comfortably and know the basics, cantering is actually easier than trotting in my opinion - but you need to have balance and be able to sit with the horse. If you're bouncing all over the shop, you'll feel very nervous and unbalanced and you'll find it hard to keep control.    It's also easier to canter on nicely-conformed, larger horses sometimes. The comfiest canter I ever rode was on a clyesdale, it was like being on a rocking horse!|`|6EUbvmfHaa	I used to have the same problem. Try to pull your shoulders back and push your chest back. Gradually you will feel comfortable to pick your hands up off the mane.|`|QTT9380Yaa	Put your heels down. If you want to work on balance, work on cantering on the lunge line. If you want, hold on to the pommel and just have your horse controlled by the person lunging you.|`|vaulPrAmaa	well, i'd suggest sitting up a little in your seat.  Not standing, just barely hovering.  also, hold onto the pummel of your saddle if you don't want to hold onto the mane, just make sure the saddle's tight.  (it is english, right?)  look ahead too - it's like balancing on one leg, look ahead of you, don't twist, and flow with the movement of the horse.  Good Luck!|`|jQvT6k7raa	How can you balance better when Cantering? You let go of the mane. Your problem is not balance at the lope, it's balance, and confidence in general.  All you need is practice. you need to understand (not just know, knowing and doing it are different!) that holding the mane makes it worse. if you hold it for balance, and when you hold it your balance is compromised, then you would do better without holding it! So just Get past the lope transition (witch is really the hardest part, at least no my horse) relax, wait a few strides, and then just let go. just relax your fingers, pull your hand back, and move with your horse for as long as you can. even if it's just a stride or two. Then grab it again, and ask the horse down to a walk.   Guess what? You just loped without holding the mane! Keep practicing, and soon, it'll be easy!  Best Of Luck!|`|6j4igZ9Haa	For better balance when you're cantering you'll need to improve your seat and position but from what you said though I would say it's just confidence that's letting you down. Less confident riders tend to lean forward and bring the legs back and up which will totally knock you and the horse off balance. Try and keep your seat deep, sit up straight and tall, shoulders back and head up looking where you're going not what the horse is doing, keep your weight centered and down, stretch your legs as long as they'll go, heels down, toes in and just follow through on the horses movement from your hips. Be brave and let go of that mane! It would probably help if you could get an instructor that can work with you on developing an independent seat or at least have someone lunge you without your reins. Everyone had to learn at some point so don't be worried about it, work on your confidence and developing a better seat and eventually it'll come.|`|9KVmd9Hzaa	Try to ride bareback with a pad. This will make you use your legs more, and if you need security you can hold onto the little bareback pad strap. And it won't make you lean over the front end of your horse. My mom makes me ride without stirrups all the time. It really helps with my position and balance when I ride.|`|c246ac86dcaacf7f923baa2e96250f43aa	It just takes time I think. I used to hold on to the saddle horn till my hand was bruised. do you ride western? i can only help on western. Um just try to find a comfortable spot you like and put your free arm in a comfortable spot and just try not to grab the mane. It takes time but eventually you'll get it . just keep workin on it. Sorry i couldn't help if it is english. Godd Luck tho = )|`|cMz0Cbu4aa	Well. What I do is either go into 2 point (not sitting on the seat) or just clamp your legs nicely around the horse. Also, horses have a certain direction which is more tolerable for the rider.|`|bTvrv59saa	HEALS DOWN! That is ALWAYS what you do. (Not trying to nag or yell)|`|EQvAbyvcaa	If you can't relax, your horse will know it and you will not be able to be successful.  Without confidence, it is unlikely you can improve so maybe you are not ready to canter again yet - think about it.    In general, when riding, move with your horse.  Your body should do what his body does.  Sit deep in the saddle, open your knees, balance the balls of your feet on your stirrup (no standing or excessive weight in your feet and legs - this will make you pop up  and forward), and relax your body but especially your legs and pelvis.  When you canter,  you should actually think about leaning back.  Too many people lean way too far forward when riding - too much weight on your horse's front end.  When he takes off to canter, the horse has to lift his front end and pick up his canter lead in the hind end.  If you are forward, this makes it very hard for your horse to do his job.    A little exercise to keep your seat deep in the saddle:  Hook one of your thumbs on the cantle behind you under your butt.  When you canter, keep your butt in contact with your thumb at all times.  I know it sounds odd but it works.  If you are not confident enough for this with one hand, put something under your butt in your saddle (a tissue or paper towel, a feather, you get the idea) and just think about leaning back on it and not letting it escape from your seat.    Most of all, don't do anything you don't feel comfortable doing.  If you are fearful or apprehensive, just wait.  This is not a race and you want to be safe.  Give it time and things will work out.  Relax.  Riding and spending time with your horse should be fun.
bDPVRtCNaa	~Goldfish will commonly suffer from bloating, swim bladder issues, dropsy, ammonia burns/poisoning, internal parasites, bacterial infections, etc. But by maintaining water quality, feeding a correct diet, and buying healthy fish to begin with, all of these are easily avoidable.     ~If you have a curious cat you absolutely need a very sturdy aquarium hood.    ~They are both ryukins just different colors. Buy two similarly sized and they won't discriminate each other.     ~ The usual recommendation for two fancy goldfish is a minimum of thirty gallons.    ~Chinese algae eaters may eat algae when young, but as they get older they become nuisances, plus they are tropical fish. The majority of algae eating fish are tropical and should not be mixed with coldwater fish. Scrapping the fish is really not such a bad chore. Algae should not be a problem so long as the tank is not overstocked, not near a heat source or window, and you do weekly water changes of 25%.    ~I would be concerned about the stress from shipping the fish. I would first visit all your local pet stores and observe their available fish before ordering from the internet.|`|ZFLx5CQXaa	http://gifts.freebiejeebies.co.uk/47071

If you just got them during the last day or two, they're still getting used to the new tank. It's normal for fish to be cautious for a while after being plunged into a new environment.|`|37TowRL7aa	what size tank?  when did u get them?  how many did u get?  wat do they liv with?|`|o9dMd2rBaa	It's normal for Rainbow fish. They do move around, but many times too, they kind of stay stationary. Nothing to worry about, just wait
T6yYgMIUaa	If you are feeding frequently and doing plenty of water changes, I would say that by 2 months they would be big enough to go in the adult tank. Keep in mind though that guppies can breed at 3 months old and the more interbreeding, the less vibrant colors. Good Luck!|`|37TowRL7aa	2 months of age, unless they are very fast growers, and eat allot
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	They're sitting about because they're in an unfiltered bowl that's WAY too small for any Goldfish. Whoever sold you that needs slapped wrists and educating.    Fancy Goldfish need a minimum of 20 gallons each ideally, fully cycled and over filtered.    Common/Comet Goldfish need more like 55 gallons each, fully cycled and over filtered.    These are large and very messy fish. You have babies right now.    They are lethargic due to their tiny surroundings and inevitable ammonia/nitrite spike burning them inside and out.    I suggest returning the fish to the pet store and researching proper fish care, and buying a proper fish tank.|`|gHKJmygoaa	First, goldfish are pond fish and that pair needs at least a 40 gallon tank. They also need an air pump and filter. Goldfish are not simple bowl fish, they probably aren't healthy or happy.   That bowl will stunt their growth, which means that while their outsides stop growing their organs keep growing and eventually they will die because of that.   So, to reverse their poor health get a 40 gallon fish tank, cycle the tank [good bacteria to turn their waste into ammonia, then into nitrites and nitrates] and always treat your water with tap water conditioner [removes chlorine, metals, and other contaminates].|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	well hopefully u have a filter and second its probably because u need like a huge tank to just even have one kind of goldfish|`|sREBdx35aa	it sounds like it is a new set up, let the new fish get used to each other. A 10% weekly water change would be helpful also.|`|37TowRL7aa	u want to reverse their un healthiness?  get a filter for a 120 gallon tank, and get them a 60 gallon tank.  goldfish get 1 foot long, and produce lots and lots and lots of amonia, which kills fish.  u should return them NOW!

AA11565057	If you're 15 and broke and your parents dont have money, do NOT get a horse. Horses are one of the most expensive pets around. It's not the price of the horse that's the big thing, it's making sure they're boarded properly, get proper vetinary care, get their hooves done (this needs to be done every couple of months), they need their teeth taken care of as well, adn they need to be exercised.    If you want to get a horse, why not volunteer at a local horse rescue, RDA or stables? It will teach you more about what's required to look after a horse, and will give you the chance to know what you want or need. You also should be getting riding lessons every week so that if you get a horse, you'll know what to do with it. You and your horse will not be able to teach each other.    You will also need to keep about $1000 free at any given time in case of emergencies. Horses can be quite accident-prone and vet bills are expensive!    Sorry to be a downer, but horses are not the right pet for someone who doesn't have money. Loving them and giving them a lot of attention is NOT enough to keep them happy and healthy. Wait until you're an adult and earning some money, and know how to ride. Then consider getting a horse.    An option if you really do want to have a horse to look after is leasing one for a year or two. That way, you could learn about horse care and have one, and then if you still want one after your lease is up, you would be in more of a position to buy.|`|u1HahCoqaa	If you do not have the money, you don't have the money- and horses are not cheap.Ok, so lets say you get a horse for, say, $1,200.( Although horses range from $800- over $10,000. ) Well, you are gonna have to keep the horse somewhere. And unless you have a farm out in the country, you'll have to board your horse. Thats anywhere from $120-$500/month. So you have to pay that out 12x a year. Every year. And you'll have to buy feed, and possibly even hay if where you board doesn't provide it. My horse goes through a bale a day. Think $3.50 each, more or less. Grain- Well, that depends on what brand. Usually $10-25/50lb bag. Now, you'll also need tack, like a saddle, girth, and bridle atleast. Thats a good $1000+. Saddle pads- Average $15-20 ea. You'll need grooming supplies- about $25 tops. Now, your horse will need his feet trimmed every 8 weeks. He might even need shoes. That's about $120 (every 8 weeks) for shoes, $60 for a trim (every 8 weeks). What about worming? He'll need a dewormer every 4 mo or everyday. That's about $16+ ea. And what about vet bills? He will need his teeth floated every year or so. Thats not cheap. And if he gets hurt, thats really pricey. My horse needed 8 stiches- $400+. And unless you never want to go anywhere with your horse, you'll prolly need a truck and trailer to haul him. Thats like atleast $9,000. And thats not counting gas. Which, incase you havn't noticed, isn't cheap. And if you ever want to enter in shows, you'll have to pay show fees, plus the needed tests, like coggins, or vaccinations. Thats $50+ all together. Although some shows, the entry fee alone is $400.   Yeah, your horse would prolly wanna blanket. Thats $25-$60.  Oh, and clothes for you.   ------------------  Lessons would be nice, although not required. Think $15-50/time. Although it depends on where you live.      - So, ask yourself now- am I someone who can own a horse? Or, more so, can my parents support the finacial burden of a horse? At 15, there isnt much you can do if your parents cannot support it.     You could try getting a job at a barn. Then you would be making money and could spend time around horses. Or you could look into a partial lease of a horse. That would be cheaper than buying or a full  lease of a horse.|`|foTSL4vjaa	I think a horse is the pet for you. If your parents cant afford to buy you a horse at the time, find some ways to earn the money. Have a yard sale or a bake sale. you could also get relatives and friends to help you out. If a horse is too much for your parents right now start off with another pet such as a golden lab or something. it will show them you are responsible and maybe when you have the money they will agree that you're ready to take on the responsibility of a horse.     Good Luck!
ptNy4uicaa	Yes he may be basking or just found a comfortable way to lay.

psUfOHWKaa	I had a mare who would occasionally colic when she was in heat (fortunately it was always just a mild case of gas colic) and every time we'd find her lying in her stall with her lip curled up.

If your horse had even mild colic, I would not have allowed her to have any grain for at least 12 hours, especially since you do not know why she was having the symptoms.  Horses who colic refuse food for a reason.  You gave her drugs to relieve her but you cannot be sure she has cleared her problem whether it was a gas colic or some kind of blockage or impaction.  If she feels better she may eat but that is not advisable, at least with grain.  I would monitor her carefully.|`|vaulPrAmaa	no sorry - but it could be something totally unrelated.  I'd talk to your vet though.|`|p9A61dFgaa	The lip thing could be her telling you shes uncomfortable. I work at Crosskennan Lane Animal Sanctuary(horse sanctuary) Don't give her food if its colic which it sounds like it that's going to make it worse. If she doesn't stand up call the vet shes in pain. If she is standing try to walk her around slowly, watch for signs of discomfort. Then check her the rest of the night, give no FOOD
rTSwouqXaa	Equine infectious anemia (EIA) affects Equidae and is caused by an equid-specific lentivirus in the retrovirus family, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). Although the majority of persistent infections appear to have minimal clinical consequences, EIA may be seen in epizootic form with high morbidity and mortality. Infection can be accurately diagnosed with laboratory tests. Because there are no effective and safe vaccines, many countries have established control programs based on serologic testing.   Transmission and Pathogenesis:   EIA is a bloodborne infection; virus can be found free in the plasma or cell-associated. Infection with EIAV appears to persist for life and, in nature, blood-feeding insects initiate most infections by mechanical transfer of infective blood between horses in close proximity. Tabanids, horseflies, and deer flies appear to be the most efficient vectors because the pain of their bite initiates host defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in additional host-seeking behavior. As EIAV has not been shown to multiply in insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the virus. Iatrogenic transmission has a high epizootic potential that can be avoided by standard precautions, eg, disposal or decontamination of needles and equipment between horses.       Clinical Findings:   Exposed equids generally support viral replication for days to weeks before antibodies to EIAV can be detected. The incubation period ranges from 10 to 45 days, usually lasting 21-42 days after natural transmission. Peak viremia often occurs during a febrile episode before the horse becomes test-positive. These acute signs often go unrecognized in horses on pasture and may be accompanied by a mild reduction in platelet counts and transient inappetence. Often, infection is noted only after routine surveillance testing for EIA or when the horse develops recurring clinical bouts of fever accompanied by marked platelet reductions, petechial hemorrhages, anemia, depression, weight loss, cachexia, and dependent edema (hallmarks of the chronic form of EIA). EIAV infection can therefore present as an inapparent infection or as an acute or chronic disease. The clinical manifestations are determined in part by the viral strain and dose, and the genetic makeup and status of the immune system of the equid. For example, strains of EIAV adapted by rapid serial passage in horses can kill horses within 14 days of infection but may have no clinical effect on donkeys. Likewise, strains that produce no or mild clinical disease in adults have killed immunologically immature fetuses or immunodeficent foals. Frequently, EIAV enters a herd and is transmitted silently until the chronic form of the disease is noted. By that time, a high percentage of the herd can be infected.   Lesions:                                                     Equine infectious anemia, mucous membranes                      In acute cases, the spleen and splenic lymph nodes are enlarged. In chronic cases, necropsy reveals emaciation, pale mucous membranes, subcutaneous dependent edema, splenomegaly, and enlarged abdominal lymph nodes.    Microscopically, there is proliferation of reticuloendothelial cells in many organs, and periportal and perisinusoidal collections of round cells in the liver with accumulations of hemosiderin in Kupffers cells. Perivascular lymphoid accumulations may be seen in other organs also. In some horses, there is proliferative glomerulitis with glomerular deposition of immunoglobulins (IgG) and complement.      http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index....|`|jV7SmnaTaa	It is a blood test named after a man with the last name Coggins that discovered it.  It's a test for equine infectious anemia (EIA).  Typically you need a coggins test inorder to go to a show or ride even at most state parks or to cross state lines.  Best wishes!|`|AA11027121	Coggins is the name of a test done to see if a horse have EIA (equine infectous animemea) It is like the equine version of HIV it attacks their immune system.  It is also spread a lot easier.  Most shows or events require you to have a negative Coggins test preformed each year. The name coggins comes from the guy who developed the test so it is named after him.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	It is a test for Equine Infectious Anemia- the horse HIV.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Its a test for a highly contageous disease that spreads very quickly!

Only for a long period of time.  If you want more info, go here: http://www.eqgroup.com/Library/equine_in...  Its hard to see that a horse has EIA.  Your best bet would be to get it tested!  ;)  If a horse turns up with EIA, I believe it has to be put down, and the other horses in its prescence must also be tested/put down.|`|yLxuHxHbaa	google it|`|0YrSsKUmaa	It's the test for Equine Infectious Anemia|`|vaulPrAmaa	the coggins test:  a test that checks for equine infections

(Named off of the daughter and pet hawk from a movie called The Royal Tenenbaums) I find that cockatiels don't really respond to their names, so I just named them whatever I thought fit.    Margot was originally supposed to be a girl. Later I found out that he's actually male from his beautiful whistling and male mannerisms(I still call her a girl because of *his* beauty!) He's a white/grey pearl color, VERY gorgeous. He was hand-raised and extremely affectionate from day one. I figured "Margot" would be a good name for "her" because of how sweet-sounding the name is.    Mordecai is my rebel. He may be around 6 inches tall, but he stalks around like he's 10 feet tall! I named him after the pet hawk because of the way his eyes pierce you. He's a half-lutino half-normal colored one.|`|BX8rrBajaa	I got my first cockatiel when I was six years old.

G0KKfXMUaa	He will fill out, eventually.<br>  <br>  Before going into specific exercises, let's talk about nutrition. I'm sure he's been fed fine... but if you want to build significant muscle by the summertime, I would up his feed or add in certain supplements to promote muscle growth. I would talk to your vet as to which option to go with.<br>  <br>  So to begin building muscle, start by walking and trotting uphill quite a bit. And do not just do a very slow sitting trot, get his butt moving.<br>  <br>  After he gets used to this, you can try cantering uphill (make sure the hill is not too slanted though). And then progress to a hand gallop.<br>  <br>  You can also trot poles going uphill.<br>  <br>  Now do you jump at all? If so, set up a crossrail or low vertical, and jump going uphill. Once he gets used to these exercises, set up a line going up hill. And after this, a series of bounces.<br>  <br>  Jumping will really help improve his muscle. And as a bonus, it also helps him pace to the jump calmer for shows, or general riding.<br>  <br>  But if you don't jump, then just do a lot of uphill pole work.<br>  <br>  Stretch low? Well... that could mean multiple things. So I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  But I would definitely stretch his neck out well before riding, and perhaps after. Just put on the halter and lead rope. Take a treat and put it to his withers, encouraging him to bend his neck and reach for the food. Make him hold the stretch for a few seconds, and do it on both sides.<br>  <br>  Have fun =)|`|uCb2dnTZaa	I agree with the saddle fitter. To get your horse to stretch low, use firm, steady pressure with your legs, and do gentle half halts until he stretches. When he stretches, completely relax the reins. If he starts to come up again, reapply your leg, do half halts again, and when he starts to stretch again, relax the reins. <br>       Other exercises you could do include stretching his head down over poles and cavalleti, lunging him w/out a saddle, and lots of long-lasting, steady flat work sessions. You could also try looking up different types of massage. Good luck!|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Kudos on having a saddle fitter come out! Hillwork and having your pony go long and low on the flat will begin to build up his muscle through his hindend which will then translate to muscle in his back and eventually in his neck. Hillwork is pretty self-explanatory. A long sweeping hill versus a short steep one would be best. Work first at the walk and then at the trot, up and down, up and down... Repetitive, but worth it! To get your pony to stretch you need to have a basic understanding of contact. Get your pony moving forward (try this first at the walk before you progress to the trot) with you seat and legs. Establish a feel of the horse's mouth through the reins and begin to get an "elastic" connection from the bit to the reins to your hands to your elbow to the rest of your body. You can begin to slowly play around with that connection once you have achieved it. Release your elbow a little, encouraging the pony to stretch his head down. When he does KEEP the elastic connection with the reins (suddenly throwing your horse on a loose rein with confuse him) but soften your hands and allow the reins to slowly get longer as he stretches down, all the while driving him forward with your seat and legs. I would suggest working with a knowledgeable trainer if this all sounds new to you. Good luck!|`|gDh1t1Yyaa	Get him walking up and down hills. Trotting poles to lift his legs up. A lot of ground work, mild jumping to make him lift his front legs up. Imagine he's a person, what exercises would you reccomend for someone in the same situation?<br>  xxxx

Qq9dRq6Oaa	LOL I don't think there is anything wrong with you cat it is probably his personality some cat are just very territorial.  My cat 'patrols' the house when I have visitors we joke say he's checking the perimeter but don't if it to keep something out or to keep us in but he doesn't attack ppl or dogs although he did chase my friend through the house one day.  I think it was his way of playing.  If your cat has not been de-sexed I would start there and as people have advise I would introduce visitors to him before coming into the house that way he can give them his tick of approval before they come into his domain.|`|tRfgwT5saa	Try introducing people to your cat before the come into your house.|`|fBW54cAraa	I know this works for dogs, and since it's based on operant conditioning, which works on most mammals, it might work for you.    Invite some guests to come by, prep them to remain calm around the cat, and have each one toss him one of his favorite treats.  Keep this up for a few weeks (1-2 people a day) and he may get the idea that visitors = good.|`|AA10387399	LOL|`|3opnkGFDaa	well cats are territorial animals, and pitbulls were created to kill... i dont think it will be easy to tame that cat :(|`|xfHearRDaa	ha ha that's just how your cat is. there is no way to change it. by the way, that's not like a dog at all. cats are very independent and territorial. so you can't tame him. old age will mellow him out a bit, but other then that your stuck with demon cat.
9KVmd9Hzaa	I have used them on horses and had great success. I think that they help a lot! I believe that there is a human type, but I have never used it. I have heard though that the human ones work really well too. Hope this helps.
qOiv8d3Laa	If it "feels" like the right thing to do... then do it.  Many shelters have a "try-out" period so you can return the animal without consequence if things don't work out. Good luck!      Me... kittyslave23... I know my place.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	Dog  1 that we really loved and were distraught over his death.  We went to shelter and got dog  2 four days later.  Perfect little guy but I spent the next few days looking at him thinking he was boring and could never replace "Popcorn".  It only took a week or two and he was one of the family.  He was a faithful friend when my daughter was head injured and to my mother when she was early Alzheimer.  If want a cat, get a cat.  He/ she will wiggle into your heart and you will get over your grief much sooner.  Our experience anyway.  Somehow, I think we will see our dear beloved friends again in Heaven.|`|HwujORd2aa	You have some really thoughtful answers above.   I lost my 14 yr old kitty and I missed not only her, but having a pet to take care of.  I was scared that I was only getting another pet to replace Sadie, but as it turned out I also missed being Sadie's person.  When I was ready we got one kitty.  Now I have two beauties that I love just as much, but in different ways, because they're not the same as her.  I would suggest that when you are ready for pet companionship again, go to different shelters, meet lots of animals, and get the pet that chooses you that also tugs at your heartstrings.  They have better instincts than we do about who they should be with. Also, it doesn't matter what kind of animal you get, dog or cat.  Don't do it now.  It sounds too soon.  You'll know when the time is right.  It took me several months to make the choice.  Side note:  I had a neighbor once, who always got the same type of dog and named them all Sean.  Thought that was a little weird.|`|AA11736483	The best way you can honor your deceased cat is to give another feline (rescue) a chance of living a good life. It makes absolutely no sense to go out and pay 700 bucks for some dog in a pet shop. Don't do it!  My beloved cat of 17 years died last year. I swore I would never get another cat because no one could replace her and it hurt too bad. Well it was 2 days after she was gone that I adopted another cat. It was quick and easy to get her, but It was rough in the beginning. At times I even resented her. It took us 6 months to even touch each other. Now, almost a year later, we are great friends. I'm glad I have her.|`|paHjJrrdaa	I think it would be great to adopt the dog that you really like.  It is REALLY hard to get over a pet and a new one can bring new joy to your life.  Although they can never replace your lost pet, it is nice to have another one around to care for.  Don't feel guilty about it.  You and your cat had a special bond, and I'm sure your cat would want you to be happy!  Go on and get the lab and just make a nice memorial for your cat and visit it often.  I know it's hard and what you are feeling is normal.  I lost my cat of 14 years.  It was the hardest thing to get thru so I understand.  I'm sorry for your loss :(|`|eNPcNGSjaa	You are not replacing your cat.  You are simply getting another companion.  You shouldn't feel bad that you want another pet, you should feel happy that you have a chance to help an animal that needs a home.      Which is why I TOTALLY disagree with you "purchasing" an animal from a store.  You should find a nice dog (or cat) that you can adopt either online or from a local animal shelter.  Take your time finding the right dog for you.  It may take you several more months to find the perfect companion, but I think that in the long run, you will find you made the right decision.  You could try http://www.petfinder.com/ they have plenty of animals in need of a home.    There are thousands of cats and dogs in shelters.  By buying a dog from a pet store or breeder, you are essentially condemning another one to death in a shelter.  So, instead of buying a dog, you should consider rescuing or adopting.  Trust me, you will feel much better about your decision of getting a new pet.|`|KnwsvnTjaa	You need to give your self more time before you even think of getting another pet.  You are still grieving and it can take months to move on.  Your beloved kitty was your best friend, you can't replace that.  You are right about thinking that you may be just getting into another animal on the rebound.  Please give yourself more time.  I lost my mom last summer so I know a little about grief.  My very sincere condolences on your loss.  Do take comfort in the fact that he had a very long and good life, and he had you in his life to love him so much.  Please don't hurt yourself.  I know what you're feeling because I felt the same way about my mom.  I wanted to be with her and not here.  But things do get better! He had a good life!  And you WILL see him again!  May the Lord Bless you and give you peace!|`|3iB7bnJGaa	It is fine to get a dog. You might feel like your are just replacing her and it might feel mean, but it is best for you.|`|HHYZ0Sliaa	After the death of a beloved animal, it is important that if you want to get a new pet, make sure it is a new beginning, not just a replacement. This pet is a whole new animal who gives you new opportunities for care and memories. So savor and remember the good times with your old pet and get ready for some great new times with a new pet, and have room for both in your heart, not just one.|`|Klk4QGGLaa	Same situation happened to me and I know it feels as if you lost everything you ever had. However my cat gave a litter to 2 cats one didn't make it but the other we hold dearly my point being you should try and give any animal a chance but more importantly are you ready.|`|db4TCZ7Uaa	Cuddling with a pet is probably one of the best ways to deal with grief or any other negative emotion and it's absolutely okay if you feel you need another pet in your life to deal with the loss of your cat. It may feel like you're replacing your cat but, as other people have already said, you'd be giving the dog (or whatever you choose to adopt) a better chance at life and it would also help you come to terms with the loss of your cat.    I know that when my cats are gone, I'll feel the same way as you, heartbroken and lonely, but I also know I'd want to adopt another pet as a way to cope and maybe also as a way to feel like they're still with me.    Also, just remember that the animal you choose to adopt (if you choose to do so) is still it's own individual and don't treat it either as a replacement or with resentment because it can't replace your cat. When we got our two cats 10 years ago, after our old cat died at the age of 20, my dad treated one of them in particular with something almost resembling hatred because she looked like our old cat but acted nothing like her. It's only now that he's really coming around to her and treating her properly.    Anyway, I really hope you feel better soon :)|`|AA10250756	Read this poem that gave me comfort. After a few months I did get another cat and I love her although she is not the same as the other cat, which the cat I loved the most. Get another cat at the pound and save the life of another cat. Get one that is 1-3 years old, not a kitten and it will be easier.     They will not go quietly,  the cats who've shared our lives.  In subtle ways they let us know  their spirit still survive.  Old habits still make us think  we hear a meow at the door.  Or step back when we drop  a tasty morsel on the floor.  Our feet still go around the place  the food dish used to be,  And, sometimes, coming home at night,  we miss them terribly.  And although time may bring new friends  and a new food dish to fill,  That one place in our hearts  belongs to them....  and always will.  ~ Linda Barnes ~|`|Qq9dRq6Oaa	It's obvious that your cat was very special to you and I am sorry for you loss.  Take all the time you need to process the grief.  My cat died in 2002 aged 18yrs and it took me a long time to grieve for her.  Yes you will be lonely and you may want to get another pet, as people have pointed out remember you are not replacing you cat but getting a new companion.  It took me 4 years before I got another cat - who at the moment is not happy with me cause I've just a stray kitten literally walk into my home and who is going to stay with us.  I was like you at the beginning I wanted to get another cat and then a dog but due to my changed in jobs and lifestyle etc I felt that the time wasn't right to get another cat.  I did however get some fish (Betta's) and they really are great fish to have as pets they have great personalities and this gave me some focus.  Then one day I found myself at the animal shelter and then after spending time with the kittens I came home with my cat Jet.  Grieving for an animal takes time more time than one month but if you feel you are ready to take the responsibility of having another companion whether cat or dog remember you are not replacing your beloved cat just having another pet in you ur life.  Hope this helps|`|IuYekkPVaa	The Legacy - Author unknown    "When humans die, they make a will  To leave their homes and all they have to those they love.

The well loved lap, the gentle stroking hand, the loving voice,  The place I made in someone's heart,  The love that at the last could help me to a peaceful painless end held in loving arms.    If I should die, Oh do not say, "No more a pet I'll have, to grieve me by it's loss"  Seek out some lonely, unloved cat and give my place to him.  This is the legacy I leave behind - 'tis all I have to give."|`|Zlww4emOaa	First of all , just want to say sorry for your lost, Losing a pet can be just as hard as loosing a good friend.   and second of all i would NOT get another pet to replace a past one, you are right when you say that no animal can replace your cat , if you are going to adopt one or buy one, do it because you are ready to start that new friendship while never forgetting the one that you had.   but give the new pet the fair opportunity into your life.

DT71taKcaa	what fish are you going to get?    "Well a simple saltwater aquarium, I would still recommend live rock and live sand, as it performs the simple task of natural filtration. I would make a thirty gal bigger by adding a sump or refugium under the tank. For a fish only tank You can go with power compact lighting or VHO lighting, of coarse a heater, for fish only tank A good protein skimmer, (very important) this is probably your most expense. For mechanical filtration a good canister filter will do the trick. Just remember you really can't compare the price of a marine aquarium to a fresh aquarium. There is a big difference even for the most piratical set-ups. Then a lot of patience to set it up, you will want to cycle the tank with live rock and sand for aprox 6 to 8 weeks. And test until everything stabilizes, then add your fish if possible one at a time not more than once a week until you have what you want. It takes me aprox 6 months to set up a 110 gal at my home, a 30 will not take as long, once you get past cycling."    thanks to http://en.allexperts.com/q/Saltwater-Aqu...|`|8owlj2xHaa	It is not as difficult as people make it sound. All you need to start is either a good over sized hang on the back filter with bio media or a wheel, or 2 smaller filters. You do not need live sand, or live rock.  A power head or 2 for water movement.   Set the tank up with the filters and either buy one small piece of live rock to cycle the tank , or put a cocktail shrimp in the tank under some sand. When the tank cycles add a few small fish .  Adding say one or two fish a week. Live rock would be best, ad a piece or two when you can till you can get about a pound of rock per gallon of water. When you do get this much rock you can start to remove any bio media you are using. Now once you are at this point start looking and saving for a Reverse Osmosis filter. (about 100 bucks on eBay )    My point is you can start a saltwater tank without much equipment, but until you do get the equipmentplan on doing 25% weekly water changes. After the RODI unit start looking saving for a  protein skimmer.|`|RXYZb6bsaa	This is a good beginner page.  http://www.saltwaterfish.com/vb/showthre...    www.reefcentral.com has better forums once your into the hobby IMO.|`|QDem7s5baa	Go for live rock for your bio filtration and set up a canister filter in the reverse mode fashion.Depending on what you want to keep, fluorescence lighting should be fine and a heater of course.Be careful not to overstock as I think 2-3 fish (small) would be the limit.Try adapting a protein skimmer to the tank.You may have to cut the hood for this but don`t worry too much if it`s not overstocked.A good carbon in the filter is required along wit mechanical (floss) too.Good luck.
wPod2vbSaa	I hate to think about it!! My kitten eats so much...<br>  <br>  He weighs 8 pounds and is 8 months old.<br>  <br>  He eats at LEAST 3 cans of fancy feast a day...at 68 cents a can where I live.<br>  <br>  He also eats purina kitten chow at about 5 dollars a 5 pound bag, but I've only had to buy one bag in the 5 months I've had him as he's addicted to fancy feast wet food.<br>  <br>  I also buy a new 40 pound box of kitty litter every week, at a cost of about 9 dollars. Who knew they could poop so much??<br>  <br>  If I go away, I pay my cat sitter with a 25 dollar coffee gift card if it's for a week or 10 days.<br>  <br>  So if you add it all up, my little piggy of a kitty costs me over a hundred bux a month...or over 1200 bux a year!!! YIKES!!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your project...I hope this helps.
cY8DgJv5aa	Its possible that she could start associating painful experiences with you, but as long as you are generally loving and providing, I'm sure its fine.  Kids are rough with puppies all the time and they grow up to just be tolerant of the 'attention'.  I'm sure yours will be the same.  In the mean time though, perhaps you should let her walk rather than carrying her and avoid placing her up on high surfaces (like your bed).  It will cut back on the clumsiness of you both.|`|2vz59utAaa	Stop beating your poor dog. I am calling the police. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just give her a cookie after you do something on accident - thats what I always do if I accidentally hurt my dog because I feel bad.|`|32d16c5953fcdbc4af383a739b40f745aa	No she will not. Dogs do not think like humans. You must remember this. Train the dog. When you are not actively playing with her kennel her. Do not play with her on your bed. Play with her on the floor. <br>  <br>  I suggest going and get a basic book on training a puppy. You need to be trained just like the dog. Remember that it is a dog and not human. Love on her; treat her as part of the family but still a dog.
qW0tq6A2aa	definitely take her to a vet as there are no pictures here and of course we can't see her here so we can't know for sure    however... it almost sounds to me like a URI.... that's an upper respiratory infection.... for this all you need is clavamox... or your vet might give you a different medicine... it is just an antibiotics which you can give your cat for 10-14 days.    cats that have a URI tend not to drink and the clicking/popping noise that you are hearing is congestion. if she is not eating or drinking, than of course she wont be using the bathroom either. because she is not throwing up, it is even more so why i think it is a URI. the reason why she is drooling/foaming from the mouth is probably because she cannot breathe through her nose and is breathing from her mouth. check her eyes and explain what they look like. a wagging tail actually means contentment so that is nothing to be concerned with.     URIs are not terribly serious... however if left unattended and you dont do anything about it, it can indeed become serious. i would call your vet... i guess monday because it is probably closed tomorrow (although if you feel it is an emergency you could probably get in tomorrow....when you call a vet's office, usually there is another number for emergency) but try to get an appointment as soon as possible and have your vet properly evaluate her.    i hope i have helped and best of luck!    oh and as far as eating.... try wet (canned) food and if she refuses to eat, rub it onto her mouth/nose area so that she is forced to lick it which might stimulate her appetite.|`|nLs7XDKOaa	Take her to the vet! She might have been hit on the head. Rap her up in warm blankets and drive to the vet!|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	Any way this goes you need to get her into an emergency vet.It could be  a.. an abscessed tooth that needs pulled, it could be b.. a bad cold (yes cats get them) and it needs antibiotics, or c... a chicken bone.   the fact that the cat is not peeing is also a giant concern. that could indicate urinary tract infection which can kill a cat in a matter of a weekend.there too it needs antibiotics. Any way it  goes you need to do the nearest animal hospital and take her immediately.|`|o0VyLaPiaa	She might be coughing up a hairball or vomitting.  If this is prolonged, you need to get her to a vet.|`|lyhnHhuWaa	I recommend that you stop for a second and think about what you would do if you or one of your family members were exhibiting the same symptoms.  Would you:    A. Log on to the internet and ask random strangers for a diagnosis/treatment.  B. Watch and wait for things to get worse.  C. Go to the emergency room.    HINT:  The answer is always C.    Your cat needs medical attention.  Only a veterinarian can provide this.  If you don't have an emergency vet clinic in your area, call every vet within a 100 mile radius until one of their recordings gives you an after hours number to call (most do).  Get in touch with one of them and get to the vet... stat.|`|paHjJrrdaa	You need to call your vet right now.  They usually have a 24 hour answering service for emergencies and they will redirect you to the vets home so you can talk to him/her about this.  It sounds serious.  You need to call ASAP!|`|Klk4QGGLaa	Rabies might be my first thought however whatever it is it sounds serious but to be safe you should take it to the vet and always take precautions as a serious or lethal threat.|`|AA11707728	I'm sorry to tell you your cat is probably dying of congestive heart failure.  Especially if her lips are bloody.  When my guy died, that was what finally got him.  Bring her to the vet to confirm it.
P9S5wlLyaa	Maybe she's lonely. Cats will sometimes act up if they are not happy. If she's confined to a small concrete area and left alone most of the day, she cannot possibly be a happy cat. Kitties need love and attention just as much as any other animal. If you can't provide that, maybe the cat would be better off somewhere else?|`|ZNRZM2gOaa	Hmm... well, all I can tell you is my our story.<br>  <br>  We got two kittens that were found at Wal-Mart with the mother but they were going to call the Humane Society. A lady took  in the mother and the kittens and found homes for the kittens and their mother. The kittens were really to young to be taken from their mother.<br>  We bottle feed them for awhile.<br>  <br>  Anyway, one of the brothers that we took has been pooping on the floor at times. Which I can not stand but have put up with for awhile. By the way he behaves I do believe that it is a territorial thing with him. I mean we have three litter boxes and the last time we had cleaned all three and then he went beside one of them and pooped outside of the clean litter box. ARRR....  I wanted to pull out my hair... it was CLEAN! Clean boxs, clean litter....<br>  <br>  We have tried different litter and the boxes are cleaned they are kept clean (I mean who wants a smelly box, especially the cats?) <br>  <br>  We had to take them to the vet to be checked and I brought this up to  the vet. He said that you are probably ready to throw him out and I shook my head, yes! He said that what I need to do is retrain him. He said that the next time he does this to put him in a big cat create (one big enough for two cats) and put a small litter box in there with him and food and water also. Keep him in it for a week. Because they don't want to be near their own poop (and I would guess their own pee as well). <br>  <br>  Make sure that you change the littler box everyday though and HOPEFULLY you can retrain your cat into using the litter box instead of every place else.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!! I hope I have helped in some way. I feel for you!|`|pGMO8pWzaa	my cat is really stupid she pees on everything, she has even peed on my baby clothes..so im in the blue too....i need to know be4 i get rid of her
YPlYfwvSaa	If she is biting your daughter only when you are away, the problem is that your daughter is not seen as 'dominant'. (That is the term used).  It is okay to tell your dog no!  If your daughter uses the word 'no', it is a good thing to teach her to use with the dog.  Your chi is just a puppy and needs to be taught her boundaries and who is in control.  You can teach your dog not to bite by removing her as soon as you can from the situation after she bites and telling her "no bite!" in a firm voice.  If you can teach your daughter to do this, it would be beneficial as well.  Through experience, I know that a child your daughter's age after being bit by a dog does not want to do much but cry, but even a loud 'crying' "no!" will help to teach your dog.  Keep in mind that the change is not going to occur overnight, but will take a little bit of time.      Another thing...try and teach your daughter not to take a dog's toy.  If the dog knows the toy is hers, she will be protective of it, just as a small child learns to use the term "mine." your dog knows that some toys are hers, and just as a child reacts with "Mine" if another child tries to take it away, the dog will react.  This is a safety precaution.    Overall, teaching your dog voice commands will be extremely beneficial in the long run.  If she knows what 'no' means, she will respect it.  Tell your dog "no!" as soon as you can after she bites, and remove her from the situation.  Try to get your daughter to say "no" to the dog.  Whatever you do, do not physically punish your dog. This will only make her more defensive in the future.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	She's on her way to having a major behaviour problem.  If you love your chi immidiatly take her to behaviour training.    Also make sure as she eats once in a while place your hand in her food so she knows your the boss. Dont be afraid. Be the leader.    BUT DONT HIT HER!|`|q0vKbocHaa	as soon as she bites your daugher, set the dog down and ignore her. If she isn't being held, send your chi to a different room and leave her alone. Do this all without saying ANYTHING, not even a "bad dog"|`|DqUi0xPhaa	At 9 weeks you are going to have aMAJOR problem...this is not teething it is aggression and it is showing way too early...please get her into classes and always supervise her with your daughter.    Good luck|`|5af8PNwxaa	My suggestion would be to get 'puppy training' while the chi is quite young.    This will enable your dog with socialization skills with kids or other dogs as well as straightening out the bad behaviour in the correct way - before the dogs gets older and will not listen to you.    The last thing you want is for the dog to bite your daughter, as it may go for the face next time and your daughter will carry scars with her for life.    Please think of your daughter...first.    Good luck|`|AA10470681	Although we all have this fantasy of children and dogs being best friends, children have high energy and they are not able to relate to an animal in a consistent manner. It is confusing for the dog as one time the child might pet it softly, but then next their hair is being pulled or they are being sat on or hit. Of course this is not the childs fault but you can't expect the dog especially a puppy to know that either. You may have two things going on the puppy is frightened of your child and it's trying to adjust to the new enviroment away from mom and the pack. Also,  the puppy is trying to establish its rank in the pack and having it's toys taken away by the child is saying he doesn't have a position of his own. It's very important to establish a place/area/pillow that belongs to the dog where he can feel safe and confident. As well your daughter needs to be told consistently how to interact with your pup so a clear dialogue is formed. I know with a two year old that that sort of retention may not be possible yet but I think if you are consistent with both of them as to how/what is acceptable that you will all live happily together. Maybe consider that neither of them is old enough yet to be placed ahead of the other. They are both babes and need patience, guidance and consistency.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	9 weeks is very young for a chi to be away from its mother and litter-mates.  In normal circumstances the dog would be learning  from and be socialized by the other dogs at this stage.   The poor doggie doesn't know any better so you have to teach her.  Under no circumstances should a 9 week old chihuahua and a 2 year old baby be left to fight over toys.  The contact should be supervised very closely for the safely of both babies.    Start with basics.  Work on teaching the dog to "come".  Then to "sit", especially before you give food.  "No" , etc.  When dogs are that young they play with litter-mates by biting a bit.  Try to "yelp" if doggie tries to bite.  Maybe you could have your little girl do it too.   It would give the message to the dog that the "play" hurts, in the way they pups do with litter-mates and maybe empower your tit as well.  If your little girl can "yelp" at the dog she maybe less frightened.    Your puppy needs some vaccinations before group classes.  If you can get he puppy used to other people, and other dogs (who you know are safe, vaccinated and healthy) it will help her adjust better.  You don't want the puppy to replace her whole dog family with just you.  You have to teacher her to enjoy other people as well.|`|naVUguuHaa	Maybe she's teething?|`|qlCwiXpyaa	your gonna have to tell your dog no. and that its bad. it will take some time but it will work. when she does it make sure you put her away for a few minutes and take her toys away for awhile. some of it may be teething, just like babies.
o2ekfo8Faa	First, calm down. You needn't worry too much over her becoming people aggressive (which it seemed you were hinting at). Odds are, she just felt threatened by the puppy, and was guarding the food.     However, to eliminate any other possibilities, take her to the vet to have a full examination. There could be an underlying problem that's causing her stress, which would be a very good reason for her to strike out.    If the vet rules out sickness or stress, then a trainer would be the next person to talk to. They can work with you and your dog to see if there isn't a way to control this.    Also, it is possible she's shown aggression before, you just haven't noticed it. Keep a close eye on her around food, water, toys and anything else she considers hers when another dog or person is there. Any sign of stiffening or nervousness is an indication of resource aggression, which can usually be worked through.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Dogs change easily. My dog did the same thing. You need to immidiatly take him to a behaviour training place. DO NOT JUST FIGURE HE WONT DO IT AGAIN. When I did that he nearly killed my other dog.    If you dont want to spend the money the only other thing you can do is find a new home, unless you truley love him and take him to be trained.
vfhKkiSKaa	Awww, she loves and trusts you.  I wouldn't worry about it unless she starts to show signs of separation anxiety.  Things like destroying stuff when you are gone and all of a sudden not being housebroken.

hlOawARXaa	I don't live anywhere near FL, but you could try putting an ad in your local newspaper or place "free kittens" poster at local pet stores. Maybe now you can get your female spayed so she won't wonder off and have unwanted kittens.

Kind of sad!|`|7gMJfi7saa	PLEASE dont put them in the pound. Take them to a pet store- most will take them.

d10wjRifaa	1) for starters get the dwarf rabbit they are way smaller then normal size ones, because bigger rabbits will need bigger housing for them to roam and they tend to do more mess and pee all over the place.    2) Get a cage maybe 25x25 and 12 tall you can house 2 dwarf rabbits in here    3) lettuce, rabbit food sale at petshops, carrots, grass make sure it is free of pesticides    4) for bedding use wood shavings or grass straws    5) toys get them something to chew on this keeps them entertain and trims down there teeth, exersice wheel,    6)fluffy, piwi, stumpy, pebbles, dumper    when you go to the petshop make sure u ask what would be best in diet, housing, bedding, toys etc. they will give you more undestanding|`|RYRhMyh7aa	It depends on the rabbit more than the breed. I have one that is a rex and another that is a mix. They are both friendly but the rex is a little calmer than the other.     I have mine a rabbit hutch. You can buy them at any pet store and they only take a few minutes to put together.     I use the rabbit food from tractor supply. I am not sure what its called but its in a green and brown bag. They also eat carrots, lettuce and hay.    Make sure to give them some kind of wood to chew on. That way they wont destroy the cage.    Where are you located? I am trying to find homes for my rabbits because I am moving to Colorado in a few months.|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	I will quickly answer your questions now, but for further information please visit my website: www.pixibunni.webs.com  1. It depends really, you should go to a shelter since this is your first rabbit and get a rabbit from there, maybe a one that was previously a house rabbit as the training wont really be necesarry.  2. There are lots of options really, the best in my opinion are: 'Bunny Condo', Dog Crate/Cage and Playpen. All can be found easily enough. A rabbits home should contain: water bottle, a house for privacy, a hay rack, a food bowel and some toys.  3. A medium sized rabbit should be fed 65kg of rabbit food a day. The best food in my opinion is the nuggets as it stops 'selective feeding'. You should try and give your rabbit plenty of vegetables and fruit, maybe give them the scraps from Sunday dinner? For a list of posoinous plants/food please go onto my website.  4. It depends really, hay is the most common but you can also use special recycled paper bedding. So long as your rabbit gets hay in a hay rack to eat they should be fine. Remember hay is 80/90% of a rabbits diet and without hay they can die from digestive problems.  5. You can buy toys or make them. I have a toys section on my website and a really good site to buy them from.  6. Some rabbits already come with a name, but if you get a new bunny don't decide on a name until a week. Look at their characteristics, and most of the time it will take a few months to know their sex. A female should start to form a dewlap (fold of skin/fur under the neck) when they reach 6 months old. I do advice maybe adopting a pair of bunnies, or bonding your bunny after you've got the hang of looking after them as Rabbits are best in pairs.    Hope I helped and I hope you and your future bunny have lots of fun :)  Raych  xox|`|AA10652664	1.i have a dutch rabbit, and he is the most amazing bunny. he loves to be pet and enjoys being picked up. he's also very clean.  2.i put him in a cage, but for an hour a day, you should put it into a pen to exercise.  3.they need a constant supply of hay. every day, maybe every morning, you give them an eighth of a cup of pellets, cause they love that (but it's not the best thing to feed them).  4.bedding is just a litter box with litter and some hay on the side.  5.they like to chew on things, so they may like straw-made balls.  6.my bunny's name is kana, but i really have no idea what to name yours.    check this website (http://www.myhouserabbit.com/) or just search up bunny care on google.|`|VXVwevE4aa	Before buying a rabbit please go to tour local S.P.C.A or rabbit rescue.  There are so many young and old rabbits looking for a caring new home after having a possibly bad and cruel start.  They will give you all the advice you need and you can keep in contact with them if you have any problems.  If you adopt a bunny and it doesn't work out then they will accept your bunny back.  A pet shop or breeder won't.  Please have a look first before making any hasty decisions.|`|KIjjg3DJaa	All breeds are good breeds, it just depends on how much time and space you have. If you don't have much room, then you obviously wouldn't want to get a Giant Flemish rabbit. Dwarf bunnies are good pets, and they tend to stay under 3 pounds. But, almost every pet store or breeder sells their rabbits as 'dwarfs', and then they turn out to not be a dwarf at all. I would strongly suggest rescuing a rabbit from a shelter or a Rabbit Rescue.     As for a cage, definitely not an outside hutch. One of my rabbits is currently living in a huge dog cage. I leave the door open all day and she has free run of my closet. You wouldn't want to give your bunny free run unless they are litter trained first though. Many of the cages that they sell in stores that are "for rabbits" are really too small for a rabbit. The bunny should have enough room to stand up without its ears touching the roof and more than enough room to stretch out on the floor. I definitely thing a dog cage is the way to go.    Once the rabbit is 3 months old (they usually stay with their mother until they are 2 months), you can start feeding it veggies. But only introduce one at a time. You need to be able to tell if the rabbit is having a bad reaction to any type of veggie. If the rabbit's poop starts to get runny, then stop feeding it that veggie. Carrots need to be fed in moderation, they have a lot of calories in them. And Romaine lettuce is best. They can have as much salad as they will eat. Usually about 1-2 cups twice a day is good for the smaller breeds. Fruits should be fed in moderation, again they have a lot of calories. UNLIMITED HAY! I can not stress that enough. This helps their teeth stay filed down and helps their digestive tract. Alfalfa until 6 months old, and then Timothy hay or Orchard grass. Alfalfa has a lot of calories, so it should be like a treat, not fed too often after the rabbit is 6 months old.  Pellets should be limited. No more than 1/4 cup a day. And make sure they are timothy hay based pellets. Most are alfalfa based and they are too fattening. Also, just plain pellets, all those seeds and nuts that you often see in rabbit food is not good for the bunny. Rabbits really dont't even need pellets. Many rabbits are pellet free and only get hay and salad (my oldest rabbit is, and the babies will be once they are old enough). If you send me an email I will send you a list of rabbit safe veggies.    There are many rabbit beddings out there. Most are great, just make sure you do NOT use pine or cedar shavings. They are extremely bad for the bunnies respiratory system. If you have a paper shredder, just use shredded paper, it is cheap adn works great. Just make sure you clean bunnies litter box every day, or every other day at the very least.    Bunnies are easily entertained. Empty toilet paper rolls are one of their favorite toys. Also, wooden chew blocks help keep their teeth down.    If you have any questions, please email me. And if you do decide to get a bunny, check out bunspace.com It is like a myspace for bunnies and they have lots of great advice on their forums.|`|RP0LP2Roaa	1. go to the pound, but i like mall bunnies.. any cute one is good otherwise, dutch rabbits are good. Female rabbits are generally nicer [ive had LOTS of rabbit experience.

I now use it on my German Shepherds (and Shepherds are big shedders) and when I keep up with the brushing there is a huge cut down on shedding. I swear on this product. It gets the undercoat unlike most brushes and that's why it works so well.

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	There are several species of brine shrimp (also known as sea monkeys) with different adult sizes, but the very biggest ones get to be about one-half inch long.

BX8rrBajaa	IDK either!
NIPmV4uMaa	45% humidity is a bit low, even when he's not in shed. It shouldn't go much below 55%, and during shedding, I reccommend getting it up to 75% to ensure a good shed. Humidity won't hurt ball pythons as long as their enclosures aren't wet (wet surfaces can cause scale rot) and the heat is high enough (the combination of high humidity and low heat often leads to a RI).    If you don't have one, you can get a spray bottle for a $1 at Target. Mist the enclosure every day. If the humidity becomes too high, mist it every other day. If the humidity is still too low, mist it twice a day. Putting the water dish on the hot end will help much of the water evaporate into the air. If the enclosure has a screen lid, you can cover 3/4 of it with saran wrap, a towel, or plexiglas (I find that plexiglas works best). This will keep some of the humidity in.    What substrate do you use? Substrates such as paper towel, newspaper, and aspen don't hold humidity well. You can use a substrate such as coconut fiber that holds water well. Dampen it so that it isn't soggy or wet to touch, but so it is spongy. Some brands change color when they dry out so you know when its time to mist it.    If you absolutely can't raise the humidity, there is also the option of moving him into a plastic bin with holes drilled around the edges. The humidity will go way up. I recently moved my BP to a bin (for humidity purposes), and I have had troubles getting it below 70% when she's not in shed.|`|BX8rrBajaa	Get a little misting bottle for a dollar at Kroger.

I don't have a snake but it works great for my hermit crabs.
gM7VuCM4aa	If the female is not spayed that can make him spray even though he is neutered, especially if she goes into heat. The other male is bringing out his territorial instincts.|`|tRfgwT5saa	Spay and neuter the other cats in the house. Or maybe there's just too many cats in the house and he feels the need to tell what his territory is.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	If your other cats are intact, that would be a reason for the problem.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Are any of the other cats "intact"?  Sometimes, when there are cats around who've not been spayed or neutered, even the ones who HAVE, will get "territorial" and start spraying.    I have this problem, too, but I figure it's because there are 11 cats living in my house.  They were all born here ( different years, different parents ) and have all grown up together.  All are either spayed or neutered, but SOME of them still spray ( females, too ).  I've just learned to live with it, and use a lot of enzyme cleaner!!    If you're really worried, take him in for a checkup, to make sure this isn't health related.  If it's just the stress of other cats, then maybe the vet can give him something to help calm him down.  Sometimes Feliway helps, too.  NOT AT MY HOUSE, but I've heard others say that it's worked for them!    Hope you get some relief from this soon.  It can be a real PAIN to deal with.  Good luck.........|`|AA10387399	Ok big   1  you must clean all soiled areas with an enzymes based cleaner. Try Simple Solution  you can get it at Petsmart. If you don't no matter how well you think you have cleaned the cat can still smell and will go back to those spots.    Next this behavior may indicate the  cat has a urinary tract infection,  take  him to the Vet and have him checked out.    Then comes the I am dominate cat, but am getting insecure so I will mark my territory. This is harder to  fix. You need to figure out what is making the cat insecure. Changes in the household? a new cat, dog or kid?  More attention to kitty will help.    Last of all there is a product out called Felaway, which can help modify this type of behavior. Good luck.|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	Please spay and neuter

1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	If it is warm enough, spray water at them. don't do it if it is cold.     Also, if you are not feeding them (or leaving anything out they could consider food) they will most likely go away on their own. If she was feeding them, they are still there looking for more food.    You could also call the humane society- some have feral trapping days, and may live trap the cats, neuter or spay them, and then try to adopt them out|`|6r66qqnxaa	You are right, too many cats! And if you don't do something now there will be even more! Google Feral Cats - one of the groups is close to you. One that is national is Barn Yard Cats. They help you trap the cats and find somebody who needs barncats. Some of them may have to be put down - if they are sick or too old to be placed. But that is still better then starving and freezing to death with no help in sight. And if nobody cares for the cats they can have diseases like Leukemia that can make other peoples pets sick.

JuO3Y4d8aa	Most likely she is getting ready to shed. I have 4 snakes and before they shed they turn a lighter color than what they normaly are. Another thing that is comon when they are about to shed is that they will refuse to eat. Also she may be a little snappy because she can't see good because the skin over her eyes has become a little dull. I think she will be ok. If she has any problem shedding take a pillow case and soke it in worm water then put her inside it. while she is trying to get out of the pillow case it will rub most of her skin of. but if she can shed on her own it is best to let them shed that way.|`|HC1V8MwGaa	that happened to me once or twice. i got really scared so i brought her to zoo creatures and they were like. wow youre retarded shes going into shed. but yeah dont worry about it.|`|thF43SPLaa	It's just going into a shed.

He eats almonds because they need that for calcium.  Make sure you don't give him salt on the nuts or veggies.  If you don't give him fresh give him frozen.  Of course don't forget his pellets.

lyhnHhuWaa	The excessive thirst concerns me.  This can be a sign of diabetes, hyperthyroid or renal failure... all of which are not uncommon in older cats.  Even if he's just been to the vet, I would call and describe the new symptoms.  I think a full senior blood and urine workup is in order in this case.  It could also be that he has a UTI in addition to the URI that he's being treated for.  But, I would want to rule out other more chronic issues if I were you.|`|Klk4QGGLaa	Sense you do go to the vet and they can't find anything wrong with it then maybe i would suggest you to find out what is causing it or either you should diaper him to prevent those incidents.

bDPVRtCNaa	None. Goldfish should never be kept in bowls. They are death traps.     A single common goldfish requires a minimum of 55 gallons and double the filtration. Two require 75 gallons, and three need at least 95 gallons.     How do you expect a fish to breed in a tiny 1/2 gallon bowl? Common goldfish reach sexual maturity at about one year of age and until then it is difficult to tell gender. By one year they should be at least six inches in length, and eventually should be at least one foot long.    ~EDIT~ That pet store employee knows nothing about fish. Return the torture device and get your five dollars back. If you do not have the room or the money to buy a proper home for the fish than do not buy them. No fish should be forced to live in a tiny bowl of stagnant fish waste.     ~Common goldfish can grow at least one foot long. If a fish cannot grow to potential, than they are not healthy.  ~Goldfish produce more waste than most other fish. Where do you think that waste goes in a bowl? Nowhere. The level of ammonia will rise until the goldfish suffers from ammonia burns and poisoning.    ~Goldfish may live a few years in a bowl, but that is pathetic. When kep correctly they can live at least 15-20 years, and living longer is not unheard of. If you don't plan to give them a proper home and take care of them for the next 20+ years, than do not buy them.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Each goldfish need at least 20 gallons all to themselves.    For 3, your tank should be no smaller than 60 gallons.  Bigger is better.    It's hard to tell males from females, sometimes even for experts.  Generally, you get a group of 5-10 fish and hope you have enough breeders to get the job done.    So, for 10 fish, plus the babies, you need upwards of 2000 gallons.  Basically, a pond.    Generally, 2 males will fight over a single female.  Often to the death.    NOTHING can comfortably live in a 1/2 gallon tank.  I wish they'd stop making them.  They're cruel and unusual punishment, and will kill pretty much anything that goes in there.|`|Jguzosm2aa	A half gallon bowl is nowhere near large enough for one goldfish, let alone three.
syFLorK2aa	The problem with fluffy cotton wool like bedding is that it is a synthetic material that the hamster can not digest or chew through easily. So if a limb/paw becomes tangled, they might just struggle and make it tighter causing injury - on very rare occasions this has even led to amputation.     The other concern is that hamsters carry nesting material around in their mouths/cheek pouches. It does not happen very often, but occasionally they will accidentally swallow some. They can not then digest this and it becomes compacted in their gut, which causes a very painful and slow death. Although this is not common, trust me it is not a risk worth taking! It's a horrible thing to watch, the best thing to do really is put them to sleep if this happens.     Ripped up ordinary toilet paper is the best nesting material - it's completely safe if ingested, easily ripped up and used for nest building, a good insulator because the layers of paper trap air very well, soft and cheap.|`|aERd9Se2aa	its probably good to follow what the breeder says so... because if you don't follow it your gonna be risking the life of your hamster.. so if you really love your hamster just follow what the breeder says..|`|Xl2jpQPcaa	I've tried this before, and my hamster died soon after.

B6zl0AJDaa	Shod or barefoot depends upon several things.<br>  <br>  1.)   How often do you ride your horse.  The more you ride, the more the horse should be shod.  Depending upon the following two conditions.<br>  <br>  2.)   The type of hoof your horse has (Dark, hard feet can go without shoes easier than light feet which are brittle and have a tendency to break up.<br>  <br>  3.)   The terrain where you are riding.  Soft sandy surfaces don't wear a hoof down like gravel, pavement and rocky surfaces.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	it depends what kind of work and conditions your horse does and is in. i don't mind either; if my horse were to work on jumping and train every day, i would want him to have shoes. if he is just a backyard pony, he probably wouldn't need shoes because he doesn't have to go through rigorous exercise. if your horse does a sport (show jumping, barrel racing, etc.) he should probably get shoes. good things are that they keep the hooves from wearing down after time, but sometimes a horse takes a while to get used to them because it is extra weight on his feet. my horse doesn't have shoes right now, and probably won't need them until we start showing. he jumps, but it is on soft, dirt ground that won't wear his hooves the same as grass ground or walking on gravel.<br>  hope i helped!|`|meoRbjgCaa	I really like the philosophy behind barefoot, but unfortunately I found after months of trying it that shod (on fronts only for my boys) are better for my horses.  I have two and they both reacted differently to being barefoot.<br>  The first is a heavier quarter horse with a slight club foot in front.  All his feet did okay barefoot except for the club foot.  Due to the angle and less surface area, his hoof walls would just crumble up, causing him extreme sensitivity.  I tried it for a few months with no improvement, so he's back to shoes on the front and happier.<br>  The second, a little arab did fine barefoot, but was still a bit sensitive even after a few months.  <br>  <br>  However, the area I ride in is like climbing the rocky mountains.  Rocks and stones everywhere, so I found shod works best here. I used to live in the desert where there are much less rocks, and most are horses were fine barefoot.|`|DLxh9CANaa	Our horses are barefoot in the winter and shod during the polo and show seasons in the spring, summer, and fall. Leaving horses' shoes off in the winter months helps their feet to absorb moisture from the ground, and no shoes means no ice or snowballs in their feet, which in turn makes riding much safer. The only horses I know which need shoes year round are those which are in heavy training or which have medical issues such as founder or navicular, and need support which shoes provide. Foals don't need shoes, and neither do yearlings or two year olds, unless they are being trained or ridden hard ( as young racehorses often are at that age) or have medical problems. <br>  <br>  I will put shoes on my mare during the hottest, dryest part of the summer, to give her protection from the hard ground. Where I live, that period rarely lasts beyond the end of August- we generally get some rain during the autumn months, and that softens the ground .|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	My jumper and dressage horse is barefoot. He's barefoot because he is perfectly sound without shoes.<br>  <br>  I prefer barefoot in most causes unless the horse absolutely needs shoes. I prefer it as shoeing a horse that doesn't need shoes always seems to cause more bad than good. (It's also cheaper! LOL) <br>  <br>  And check these videos out of a barefoot horse trotting and a shod horse trotting- (note the difference in shock absorption) <br>  <br>  Shod- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z5OjjoBQNo&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5z5OjjoBQ...</a><br>  <br>  Barefoot- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si7QUK4OY0o&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si7QUK4OY...</a>|`|WJJMZ9IQaa	It really depends on the horse, I have a thoroughbred with almost no front heels so he needs thick wedges for comfort. He also has back shoes and they work for him.<br>  But some horses can go barefoot and I prefer that if the horse is able<br>  <br>  Here's a story about this sweet mare, true story<br>  I went down to the pastures one day to say Hi to an older lesson horse I used to love. On the way down to his pasture, at the end, I saw this mare that I knew had problems with her back legs due to breaking them. Now this is a famous horse with a very famous former owner. She looked old, and no offense to poor girly, very ugly, a long-shot away from the former show hunter who could maneuver a course like a pro. I asked to brush her which would require me taking her up a few hills. I go down to put the halter on her, she was in the same spot, didn't move an inch since the last time I saw her, didn't move an inch when I got the halter on. I preceded to walk her, looking at the sad look in her eyes, like a mother seeing her dead child. Before she took her first few steps she fell. I knew something was much more wrong than could have been thought. I told people about it then brought everything to groom her all the way down. The head grooms had to hold her up to to pick her feet. She was clearly in agonizing pain. She was lame on one foot. It rained the next day and the pasture is not a place for a horse who can't move. I couldn't stop thinking about this mare. I arrived the next day to see she had a huge barn stall with nice shavings which would be wonderful until the pastures were better. A few weeks later I saw her, in a different stall just staring into space with the same look. Her legs were so stocked up it was horrible, I found out she hadn't been out of her stall in a week or two. The stable was keeping an eye over her though, they wanted her to get better and were doing a lot to get there. I walked her and to my surprise she could walk! To my surprise she trotted! She was dirty so I spent a while grooming her wondering what could have changed. Turns out the got the farrier down on an emergency call, along with the vet.. and her shoes were pulled. That's it... shoes pulled and went barefoot. The old girl can walk and is starting to trot. She will never be able to be ridden again but the look in her eyes now just brightens my day.|`|1c6TmvrZaa	I prefer barefoot, but if you are showing or doing barrels etc (dont ride English sorry if you do I dont know much about it), I would suggest getting your horse shod on his/her front feet. <br>  <br>  I prefer barefoot for my mare because her hooves are nice and strong and I do not show her or compete or anything yet so there is really no need for it. Besides, if you dont need it why would you want to pay for it? Where I live it is 3X as expensive as just getting your horses' hooves trimmed every 2 months.<br>  <br>  I get my mare's hooves trimmed every 2 months exactly as of right now. She is only 4 so I have no need for shoes yet. <br>  <br>  Once I begin showing her and competing in local jackpots etc I plan to get her front 2 feet shod becase of the arena sand it gives them better grip and balance. Right now I am just breaking her and we ride mostly trails and just basic training in the arena. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|AA11570905	All of my horses are barefoot.  I've had fewer hoof related problems since I pulled their shoes.  Barefoot is the most natural way to go.  The hoof is designed to expand and contract upon contact with the ground.  The metal shoe nailed to the hoof inhibits this natural process, thus possibly inhibiting full blood flow into and out of the sensitive laminae.<br>  <br>  I do use protective hoof boots when riding, particularly on rough terrain.  I also make sure I'm on top of the hoof trimming schedule so the hooves don't get too long.  I have one horse that does better on a four week trim schedule, the other two can go 6 weeks.  <br>  <br>  Someone would have to have some really compelling argument for shoeing my horses for me to even consider it again.  Most people do it because they don't know any different and are convinced that a horse must be shod to be healthy.  Not true.<br>  <br>  I purchased the hoof boots 2 years ago and they have paid for themselves many times over in farrier savings alone.  Plus, I never miss a day of riding because my horse threw a shoe.|`|iz03uvV4aa	Personally it all depends.  I ride competitively as a jumper (3'6-3'9) and because my horses are going on a full program they usually require shoes so I can cork them (if we are competing on grass) and to avoid and irregular wear on their feet (if we are riding on sand - and some sand footing isnt the best some places! Tends to be a bit hard).  But through the winter when Iam training only and not really competing as much as the summer months, my horses do alright barefoot.  My ferrier suggests this so my horses foot gets a good chance to breath, grow out and harden and toughen up.  Unless my horse needs shoes though (and Ive had horses who require shoes year round due to growth issues or just simply soft, easy wearing-down feet) then they are barefoot for a few months through the winter and shod all spring/summer/fall.  Shoes also leave me weary about ice and snow, they ball up and can cause to be very slippery without snow pads and corks.  Those can get up there in price!<br>  <br>  Either or - I guess it really depends on what you do with your horse.  If your horse is in heavy 6 day a week work program I suggest putting on a shoe as a protective layer.  It cant hurt. BUT then there are the people who beleive highly in barefoot and oh' naturale.  This is totally fine too. There are GREAT supplements out there that can harden a foot and help keep a foot very very healthy and durable.  But no matter what, I couldnt, no matter WHAT the supplement or how good oh'naturale was, ride my horse barefoot around a 3'9 course all summer. My horses foot would wear, fall apart and break down.  Shoes can be a protective barrier too for shock etc!<br>  <br>  After all, a horse without feet isnt a horse at all. So its important to analyze what you and your horses are doing and what your horses individual needs are. A good ferrier is something to always keep, they are hard to find so he's the best to consult with with regards to what might be best for your horse.<br>  <br>  Anyways - just my two cents! :)<br>  <br>  Good Question !!!!!<br>  <br>  Here a couple links about Natural Hoofcare and Shoeing:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.texasnaturalhoofmanship.com/natural_hoofcare.htm#Normal_vs._Natural_Hoof_Care" rel="nofollow">http://www.texasnaturalhoofmanship.com/n...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.synergistsaddles.com/horse_tack_articles/hoof_care.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.synergistsaddles.com/horse_ta...</a><br>  <br>  I like this one ALOT.<br>  <a href="http://www.balancedhoofcare.com/barefoot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.balancedhoofcare.com/barefoot...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalsolutions.org/hoofcare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalsolutions.org/hoofcare...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/shoe.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatehorsesite.com/info/sh...</a>|`|mKWwz1uUaa	Barefoot all the time for my horses.  I feel not only is it safer due to when out in the field, on the trail, other horses getting kicked and so on it's safer without.  And best part is cost way, way cheaper with out.  I ride on trails, did speed and action, road ride (dirt/pavement) and so on all natural, you just don't "beat feet" on the roads or hard surfaces weather shod or not.  Once shoes are removed they take time to adjust just like we do goin barfoot in the spring, if we went barfoot all the time wouldn't have to worry.<br>  <br>  Barefoot is the best, for me and my horses|`|wKCgaoZVaa	I think whatever works for the horse.  My shetlands are barefoot and its most natural for them and works great.<br>  <br>  If you are doing tons of work on gravel or road, then its kinder to shod the front hooves.  My old horse was barefoot but when we got him was very very footsore on the roads. As soon as we put shoes on him he was a different horse, soo much happier.<br>  <br>  So barefoot is more natural, but not always the answer. The key is to find a great, kind farrier that gets to know what is best for your horse.|`|6EP7ILr3aa	My horse has shoes. Why? because its easier and if you go barefoot you need to get them special boots, you have to ride on certain surfaces. Also if you go barefoot your horses diet has to be kept strict to keep them healthy and thats a problem for my cob as he gets overweight during spring and because he lives out 24/7 I cant controll his grazing. Going barefoot is harder than getting your horse shod.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	well, both of my horse's are shod in the summer time (all 4 feet) mostly because they have sensitive feet. my mare needs special shoes on all 4 feet year round, due to poor leg anatomy. (you take her shoes off and she's dead lame for months) my gelding on the other hand has all 4 shoes only in the summer. during the winter we take his back shoes off to give his feet some time to heal, but his front stay on year round. they both get trimmed & re shod every 4-6 weeks.<br>  <br>  as for an opinion, it depends more on the horse. if he's only in light work on soft ground, gets regular trims, and has healthy feet then i see no problem with him going barefoot. but seeing as both of my horses are in heavy duty, full time work, they require shoes most of the time. <br>  <br>  links:<br>  <a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art44835.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art4...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pdfs/horses/barefootvsshod.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pd...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.barefoothorse.com/barefoot_Horseshoes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.barefoothorse.com/barefoot_Ho...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps & good luck!<br>  <br>  edit-<br>  my mare's shoes look like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.thehorse.com/images/content/ready-made_heart_bar0898.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thehorse.com/images/content/r...</a><br>  and my gelding's look like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.hoofnail.com/images/shoes/01_standard_plain_200.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoofnail.com/images/shoes/01_...</a>|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	My horses are shod. I have just their front feet done. My older horse could not cope barefoot full time, and my youngster needs extra support due to having very thin soles and poorly conformed front feet.<br>  <br>  I'm certainly not against barefoot, but it doesn't suit my horses. Each horse should be assessed as an individual, to ensure their welfare is put first.<br>  <br>  Domestic horses don't travel widely; they spend a lot of time in stalls or paddocks where the ground is soft. Their hooves, which were adaptable in the wild where travel was constant and varied, get too long and uneven under domestic conditions. Hooves, like our toenails, have to be kept trimmed back or their growth makes them frail and uneven, causing large pieces to break off. If your horse's hooves break, split or grow unevenly, they can cause your horse to become lame. When people wear shoes that don't fit properly, their balance and spinal health are compromised: proper hoof care for horses is as important as wearing properly fitting shoes is for humans.<br>  <br>  Aside from environmental factors, breeding affects the way your horse's hooves work. While many horse owners focus on conformation around the head or even the colors and markings of the coat, too few people pay attention to the way horse's hooves are shaped, how strong they are and how they affect the overall health of the animal. Whereas wild horses with poor hooves would have been taken out by natural selection, bred horses can pass along the genetics that create weak or badly shaped hooves.<br>  <br>  If you start with a foal, start him off right by getting an opinion on his hoof conformation from your veterinarian and a farrier. Working horses need to be shod to protect their hooves; since hooves need trimming about every six weeks, finding a good farrier is vital to keeping your horse in good shape. You'll want to consult with an expert about when your horse should start wearing shoes and the type of shoes that will work best for the kind of activities your horse will take part in. Since proper traction is a factor in hoof and leg health, there are shoes made especially for equestrian sports like jumping, dressage or reining. Talk to your farrier about the way you plan to work with your horse, so he gets the right shoes for the job.<br>  <br>  Hooves grow about a quarter inch each month, and need trimming to stay even and to prevent breakage. The farrier removes the shoes, trims the hooves and replaces the shoes. Shoes won't keep your horse's hooves from growing; if they aren't trimmed often enough or if they shoes stay on too long, your horse will go lame. Sometimes the shoes can be reused; your farrier will decide.<br>  <br>  Shod hooves do pick up more debris than unshod ones, and the packed rocks, mud or even ice can cause your horse pain and injury. The added pressure makes walking uncomfortable and can create a bacterial infection in the sole of the foot. Pick out your horse's feet each day to remove foreign matter and prevent infection.<br>  <br>  If your horse has tough, smooth hooves that aren't inclined to get too long in the toe or deform in other ways, and if your activities don't require special shoes for support, you horse may be able to get along fine barefoot. The hooves will still need trimming every six weeks: many horse owners learn to do this work themselves. The drawbacks to shoes include more difficulty in keeping the hooves picked clean, the fact that shoes sometimes catch on steps or rails and can cause injury, and that getting kicked with a hoof is a wee bit less dangerous than being kicked by a hoof shod in metal. Much depends on the conformation of your horse's feet and legs as well as the way you intend to work with your horse. Talk to your vet and speak with a farrier before deciding if your horse can go without shoes.<br>  <br>  We've removed the horse from his wild environment, where his hooves basically took care of themselves. Now we must make sure he gets regular hoof care to keep him comfortable and sound.<br>  <br>  There's LOADS of information out there, but here are a few links to articles to get you started:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bitlessbridle.com/ecom/sp?dbID=342" rel="nofollow">http://www.bitlessbridle.com/ecom/sp?dbI...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.balancedhoofcare.com/barefoot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.balancedhoofcare.com/barefoot...</a>|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Horses that are used for performance, heavy riding, athletic events, your heavy duty trail riding up and down mountains, horses that need some corrective work done to fix angles that are off, show horses especially depending on the discipline,  on and on. These all need shoes to protect and support their hooves even if they have great feet.  <br>  <br>  Different breeds have been bred over time to create the ideal hoof for the different job they were bred to do.   So not every horse is comparable to the wild mustang for example, they all have different needs and you have to take the horse you are working with and address his needs and take action accordingly.<br>  <br>  If you are using your horse alot with heavy riding then they are necessary.  <br>  <br>  If they are ridden lightly, in the pasture alot, and just for pleasure it is not always necessary, barefoot is usually just fine. <br>  <br>  It really does depend on what you are doing with your horse and there specific needs.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|kixQWODVaa	I prefer barefoot.  My 26 yr old gelding has arthritis (he is a retired barrel racer and dressage horse) he was shod with corrective shoes.  We took shoes off of him last spring and haven't put them back on and don't plan to.  He seems just as comfortable barefoot and he doesn't mess up his hoof wall by ripping off shoes.  <br>   <br>  I barrel race and my barrel horses are barefoot also.  There is no reason why you need to shoe a barrel horse.  They run just as well as shod barrel horses and I don't have to worry about calling for a farrier when Im at a rodeo and my horse pulls a shoe.<br>  <br>  Shod horses seem to be more tender footed than barefoot horses.<br>  <br>  The only time I would put shoes on a horse is if there is no way they can go barefoot or if the hose is a reigning horse-sliders on back hooves.|`|A5AgBk0xaa	Both my horse, and my friend's horse are barefoot. The terrain around where we live is sand or packed dirt, with few rocks. My horse has never been shod, and my friends horse hasn't been since she moved here. In our area they cold shoe horses, so none of the shoes fit properly anyway. One of my neighbors who is a retired farrier says it's healthier and easier on horses' hooves to leave them barefoot. Currently we have a farrier come out every 3-4 months to trim and file the hooves, and he's a super nice guy that really knows his stuff. He trains horses too, so he gives them a refresher course whenever he comes out.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Well, for me, it depends on what I do with the horse, and the horse's natural kind of feet.<br>  <br>  If I have a trail horse, and he naturally has good/hard hooves, then I allow him to go barefoot. I don't feel that horse always needs to be shoed.<br>  <br>  However, if I have a horse whom I jump, I normally shoe all four hooves, or at least the front. Especially if jumped higher. And when higher jumping occurs, I always shoe no matter how good the horse's hooves are naturally.<br>  <br>  If I just use a horse for beginners, or just jumping crossrails and verticals that are barely over two foot, I normally don't shoe, unless his feet are bad. <br>  <br>  So for me, it depends on the horse and discipline.<br>  <br>  Here are some links you asked for-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.balancedhoofcare.com/barefoot.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.balancedhoofcare.com/barefoot...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bitlessbridle.com/ecom/sp?dbID=342" rel="nofollow">http://www.bitlessbridle.com/ecom/sp?dbI...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equipodiatry.com/article_barefoot_v_shod.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.equipodiatry.com/article_bare...</a>|`|36612d416e7176f5335f2b3fb47cf46caa	It depends a lot on the horse. I much prefer barefoot, it allows the frog to act as it should, it doesn't weaken the hoof by putting holes in it and they often have better grip, however barefoot does not mean no farier care, if anything you have to be more careful about trimming them and having them balenced regularily as they are more prone to wear irregularily. <br>  <br>  Having said I prefer barefoot, 2 out of 4 of our horses have front shoes on. My thoroughbred gets very foot sore and gets very bruised soles in front if not shod so he gets shod. His backs are ok so he doesn't have rear shoes on. If he started doing lots of road work or rough ground he would need shoes on his hinds as well. When he is shod and standing with no shoes on he is very tentative, doesn't really want to put his foot down and once he has the new shoe on he kinda relaxs so he prefers having them on. <br>  My cob mare has just had her first set of fronts put on. She's 3 1/2 and we're starting to hack her out a little and although she has hard feet they aren't growing very well so she is having fronts on for a few months to get them to grow out and lets us start with good feet (I've not had her long and her feet were pretty worn when I got her).<br>  <br>  Generally, I think it is better for a horse to be barefoot but this doesn't work for every horse and if you go - 'barefoot or shoes are the only way to go' - then you don't allow for flexibility where individuals are concerned - for example our other cob has very hard feet - he has been known to bend the nails! When he has been shod in the past, he sulks and won't work until you take them off. His feet are hard and grow ok so he doesn't need any shoes on and he prefers to be without so he is barefoot.|`|GbtRPEuxaa	WOW<br>  talk about response <br>  if you are a avid rider you need shoes if your not riding bare foot with a trim is fine unless your horse has thin hoof walls there are two main reasons for shoes getting a natural angle most of the time is not possible with a trim as you need to take the heal down far enough to have solid foot so the foot dose not break off and cause lameness and this angle is generally is three to four degrees lower than a natural angle (a natural angle is visible from the side of the horse the hoof angle matches the angle of the pastern when his feet are square and his or her weight is distributed evenly).<br>  this is the proven most comfortable angle for all performance horses and is different on all horses<br>  <br>  2 the other reason is to protect the foot from damage under heavy use and different shoes are used for different performances and give you the competitive edge<br>  there are hundreds of different types and styles of shoes and each have different jobs well i could go on and on i think this should help most people that do Natural balance are not seasoned professionals and over the coarse will change their prospective<br>  <br>  A few different and beneficial shoes for avid riders<br>  racing plate for racing,<br>  sliders for reining<br>  shoes with toe grab and heel caulks for trail<br>  eventers for eventing<br>  rim shoe <br>  plantation<br>  light shod<br>  <br>  just to name a few.<br>  <br>  Jeff Curry|`|PKwEKfG7aa	It all depends on the kind of work that the horse is doing. If they are unnessary for the horse then they are pointless and a waste of money. Otherwise if needed then they must be shod. <br>  <br>  I don't have my own horse though so cannot give you a plan of how I would shoe my horse but most ponies who only work in schools are not shod. Infact out of the riding school poines up at the stables I go to I only know of one who has shoes. However once again it depends on the kind of work they are doing.|`|AA10188682	i live out in texas and we let our horses go unshod mainly cause of the fact that there are so many rocks in the region where we live that helps keep our horses hooves down to where it is comfortable for them.

hlOawARXaa	Every animal will require a vet appointment at some time, even hamsters. So you can't have a rodent, rabbits are nice but they do require vet appointments when they get sick. Birds are nice, I have 4 parakeets and 1 conure (small parrot), but they also require vet appointments when they get sick and I take them to the vet when they need their wings clipped.|`|Iu6u1fuwaa	a bird.? lol... thats like i think the only option. and cats get along with any thing..|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	House rabbits can get along quite nicely with cats, more so than dogs and cats. They cost about 20 every six months for vaccination for Myxie in the UK and there is also VHD to protect against. In the USA I dont think they need any vaccinations as I dont think the disease has spread there. A male rabbit will cost 40 to be neutered and a female will cost 50-60 to spay. But they can be VERY fun, they're most active from 6pm-6am so they're ideal if you work/go to school during the day. They can be very easy to care for, there only downfall is the cost to get them spayed/neutered.  For more information please visit my website: www.pixibunni.webs.com
GLS7vgAdaa	Well, I can tell you know what you're doing already when you say you're getting two. they lonely creatures if they don't have a friend. try to pick out a girl and a boy because they can be a bit territorial and two of the same sex isn't the best idea.     find a cage, maybe 4 feet high at least and fill it with a couple of nice big branches for them to climb on. remember, they're very active animals and need lots of room to play, so the bigger and taller the cage the better.     next, think of what room in which you're going to keep them. you're bedroom might seem ideal but as they're nocturnal animals they can be on the noisy side while you're trying to sleep.     they're great pets and a lot of fun. best of luck to you!|`|AA12272885	Read everything you can about them, and find the cage and other items you need.|`|foTSL4vjaa	You could start by getting a few things:    Cage(30 by 18 by 36) and made of wire(and big enough for jumping)  Food dishes:should be hanging.

Hope I helped!|`|z2cvfmdRaa	I owned a pair of sugar gliders and I loved them.  You are going to have to play with them a lot and they like to get into cracks and ledges like door tops so make sure you play in a room where they cant get any where and hurt themselves.  You also have to buy certain sugar glider toys.  I think we had gerbil toys and they didn't like playing around them that's how they died.  It will be a fun hard experience.

ak9DrBSwaa	The reality is that's not possible.    Fast facts:    Syrian hamster gestation is 16-18 days. It's technically 16 days, but they can delay implantation for up to two days. They can't delay implantation for months, don't store sperm and definetly don't have asexual reproduction. There had to have been contact with a male 16-18 days ago.    July 2008 is WELL above the 18 day mark.    Obviously, the female had to have come in contact with a male 16-18 days ago. Possible senarios which would have produced babies:    *Your female hamster has come in contact with a male hamster recently. Think hard. Has your hamster been on any playdates, had friends over or watched by anyone else?      *The hamster now in your cage is not the same hamster you purchased in July. Any chance that something happened to your original hamster (escaped, died), and some well meaning person bought a look-alike replacement that happened to be pregnant and swapped them?|`|oGVWdnHraa	Could you have a "feral"/"wild" hamster living in your house?

If that's the case all the babies SHOULD all be female, if not then I have no idea.|`|57mE02q3aa	ok when u bought it it might of did it with another hamster and yea just wait 2 weeks before u can touch them|`|Bl04dM2eaa	i don't think she could have been pregnant when you got her because the gestation period is only like 17 days...  I would be interested in knowing the answer to this.  I've heard of sharks getting pregnant without the presence of a male but not hamsters.
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	It doesn't necessarily take trust, but it definately helps. No clue on how to prove it, because all they technically need to think is that jumping is fun and that people (in general) are part of a herd. I am not saying your friend doesn't have a great bond with her horse, just this instance in itself won't prove it to someone who doesn't know the both of them.      I have had horses follow me over jumps before that I just met- they just loved to jump and play, even if they didn't care who I was. A good bond with your help will make it a better chance that you can get your horse to do something it wouldn't normally do.    My mare, while we have an excellent bond, is never going to follow me over a jump on her own free will. If I jump it, she either goes around it, or stops, knocks down all the poles, and then walks over it :) But, she is also a mare, and they always have their own personalities to throw into the bond.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Yes - if a  horse is unsure about something and another horse or person isn't bothered by it - a horse is more likely to give it a try.  They are herd animals - they never like to try things alone!    This is why horses are more likely to follow you into the horse trailer rather than just slapping them on the rump the first time and telling them to get in.    This is why they're always more confident with other horses or even a human.    Yes - most horses do trust humans...|`|Wvg9xCWHaa	have you ever heard of join up? well, if not there are lots of questions on here about it, so i'm sure u'll find one that explains what it is. join up can help with that a lot. i did that with my mare and now she follows me everywhere. but anyway, it is very possible to get a horse to follow you over a jump. hey, as long as the horse doesn't freak and if they trust you enough, i'm sure they would.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	Try the flavor you've been using.  They don't like all flavors.  Also if you're just feeding babyfood, you need to be supplementing it with calcium and vitamins and be feeding a protein source 3x per week.  If he doesn't eat mealworms, you need to use crickets.  Just babyfood will not suffice as an adequate food source.    I personally prefer to just use crested gecko diet and feed crickets once  week.  That way you aren't worrying about if they're getting enough vitamins or protein.|`|x0BKX1XWaa	DUH!!! that isn't what he eats try using crickets and flies.

You should feed it once per day a little pinch. Not a big deal. Just a little food. Try twice a day and if you see it doesn't want the food the second time than you know that twice is too much.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	Well you give the fish only the amount of food it can eat in 3 minutes, I heard to feed it every other day.

bDPVRtCNaa	Filter, heater, and any decor you wish to have.|`|AA11708471	Low current filter (like a pen n plax small world filter)  Heater (bettas are tropical)  Lid (if it does not come with one)  and thats about it|`|e56f34b226a134831834a176960b7128aa	A beta fish.|`|XHvaws8baa	hmm sounds like you have everything you need|`|HRHPmjtVaa	Unless where the tank is you will need a heater too.   You should probably get a filter. If you have only one fish in there you could maybe get by though.     Do you have any plants or caves? They need places to hide.  Thank you for getting a good size tank for a betta!     If you are new to fish keeping:  Do around a 25% water change weekly. (about 2 gallons)  Make sure you monitor your ph, ammonia, nitrites and nitrates  Live plants help keep nitrtites or nitrates down.   I would say live plants are better than fake.   Hope I helped!|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	heater and live plants|`|XfP895zXaa	get some java fern or another plant otherwise its all cool|`|DT71taKcaa	a couple of good plants like anubias nana, or pennywort,  cultured gravel?  you might need water crystals as well  food like betta bites and freeze dried blood worms as a treat  a few ornaments or rock to hide in or swim through  heater  filter    and check out this site:  http://www.wikihow.com/Take-Care-of-a-Be...|`|OsWTsB9Xaa	plants, and a fish. and a heater|`|DqOkUgVsaa	u need a filter and heater buddie

OaaJ7o9Haa	You can really only put 2-3 small fish in a 6 gallon at most. Fish types include platies, swordtails, bettas (female), guppies, tetras, danios.    However, most of the fish above are schoolers,meaning 6 or more. Realistically, you can keep platies or a betta. If you're looking for fish that aren't schoolers or without number needs, think about a molly or african dwarf frogs. Shrimp are also good pets in a 6 gal.|`|rptViwU5aa	you can only keep 1 fish in there. 2-3 inches is pretty big for a 6 gallon. i recomend getting a 10gallon then getting 3-4 fish. with decorations and gravel you should be straight.
IMPvzBk1aa	In addition to the other good ideas already listed, I would also suggest a few more things. Sterile saline in a squeeze bottle....best thing for flushing wounds or eyes....it is now the recommended first response for all wounds that they be flushed well with saline, which doesn't harm healthy tissue like iodine can, and does inhibit infection as well or better than povidone iodine or other products.    Hibiscrub.......recommended cleanser for rain rot and scratches.     Betadine has been shown to be deactivated as an antimicrobial when exposed to serum (yellow fluid found in lesions and wounds). It is fine as a skin cleanser, but not the best choice for open wounds and sores.    EMT ointment......a collagen gel with antimicrobial and analgesic properties.....best ointment I've ever seen for skin wounds and lesions. Collagen is the protein that forms the matrix in all connective tissues.  This ointment supports rapid healing very well, and I've been amazed sometimes at how rapidly healing occurs when I use it compared to other products.  Slow healing such as you commonly see in equine leg injuries increases the likelihood of proud flesh formation, so I believe the EMT also helps to prevent it.  Be sure you buy equine preparation, and not the one for dogs.  It is available online or at tractor supply stores, also Farm and Fleet stores.|`|vaulPrAmaa	stethascope, alchohol (good mild disinfectant), electrolytes (for dehyrdration), hoofpick handy (suspected lameness), fencing plyers (incase you have to pull a shoe or tighten one), slip-on boot (hoof protection for until the vet arrives), also anit-inflamitory solutions|`|r5aokD7Yaa	depending on how fast you can get a vet...  vet's after hours no. in the med kit :)  penicillin  novalsan for wounds ((chlorhexidine diacetate) probably spelling this wrong)  sutures  scalpels  oodles of adhesive tape  neck cradle (keeps horse from reaching around with neck and removing the bandages you've just applied)  twitch (though I've never used mine-- thank heavens)  epinephrine (make sure you know when and how to use-- ideally have vet on phone while administering)  tetnus antitoxin  clean unopened petroleum jelly  vet approved version of petroleum jelly based antibiotic cream (to keep bandages from sticking to outside of sutures)  clean towels  clean cooler (horse in shock)|`|8bTder08aa	Duct tape  Sterile cotton roll (not the puffs-- the stuff that comes in rolls)  Stud chain to restrain horse  Soft-sided black rubber bucket  Pack of terrycloth towels (you can get them at Home Depot or hardware stores in packs)  Good flashlight with spare set of batteries  Small "penlight" flashlight with spare set of batteries-- for lighting up inside of mouth, ears, nostrils, etc.  Phone number for your vet, his/her answering service, and at least one alternate vet.    For yourself:      Aspirin or Tylenol  Band-aids  Ace bandage for wrapping sprains  Spare pair of glasses if you need glasses to drive  Card with complete health insurance and emergency contact information, taped PROMINENTLY where someone can find it if you are unconscious    That's what I'd add to what you've listed.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	The number to a good vet.  Alcohol  Cotton balls  Uniprim- antibiotic  Nitrofurizone ointment and spray  Diapers- trust me: abcessed hoof  Uptight Poultice|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Looks good!  Maybe add some probiotics (can help with mild colic... won't do much but can buy time until the vet gets there), also some sedatives so that you can stop a horse who's injured from hurting himself more until the vet gets there.
oDVx7nSxaa	No - never use a dog product on cats as many of them contain ingredients that are safe in dogs, but lethal to cats.  Cats and dogs metabolize things differently - for instance aspirin is very helpful for dogs but will quickly kill a cat!  Your best bet for ear mites is something from the vet, but if you won't do that, then use plain mineral oil. Put a couple drops in each ear every other day, fold the ear flap down and massage it in.  Treat for two weeks.  It will make the fur around the ears a bit messy, but it does work, and is really about the only safe treatment for kittens less than 8 weeks old.|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	try to find a website on the brand. if it doesn't say on bottle for cats, i wouldn't.|`|nLs7XDKOaa	NEVER use dog medication on anything but dogs!|`|zBvKemqAaa	NEVER USE ANY DOG MEDICATIONS ON A CAT...this is very dangerous.  Go to you regular vet and have them prescribe a remedy to you and get them to examine your cats ears.  Mites are very common and east to treat with the proper medication(s).  Always remember, it is very easy to cause damage to a cats sensitive ears.  Always get medical advice from your regular vet.
CqQ1DaKDaa	Are you saying you'd like a reptile/amphibian. You considered a trantula or a scorpion. A lizard would probably be your best bet, they don't make any noise as far as I'm concerned. Or maybe a small teripin/turtle? You should look up each animal that interests you over google and find all the requirements needed for that pet. I hope you find the ideal pet :)|`|upHeh1AUaa	A Cockatiel.    They are easy to tame and you can teach them to talk. They need fresh water and food everyday.|`|VF5Htmovaa	A Chameleon they are really cool|`|j7PtOkxLaa	Um, a cat? Rabbits make no noise at all, so they would be good. But they need lots of exercise.|`|foTSL4vjaa	I would suggest some rabbits. They are fun and can be kept outside in the spring and summer but not the cold seasons. They are fun and aren't loud and don't take much work to care for. Plus they're soft and cuddly.They live in a medium large cage outside that you can easily build yourself. you will need a biggish cage for inside too. (they can also stay in garages or shed throughout the winter and fall    The only downside is that sometimes they kick you. Ouch!      Hope I helped!|`|9xdhln93aa	if u are going to live in a small place i would have a small dog like a winnie dog, sitz zou.  but if a big place and u want the best dog in the world get golden retriver or a lab both very good dogs.

wGajPFJxaa	With them being a small bird, you should be able to clip their nails with human nail clippers.  Just take the sharp tip of the nail off.  One little snip should do it.  You won't be taking very much off at all, so there should not be a problem.  I have 2 cockatiels and I clip their wings and nails regularly and I use human nail clippers to trim their nails.  I cover them with a towel and leave their feet free so that they do not try to nip at me.  Quick and easy.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|Zo7IQX3raa	Idk cause i dont have a parakeet!|`|QxIhMHwAaa	Unless you have someone to help you (someone to hold the bird, someone to clip), I would advise taking the bird to a bird shop or vet to get their nails trimmed. It's usually pretty cheap, ranging from $2-$10. If you go to a bird shop, bring your own towel for them to hold the bird in so that they don't come home with mites.|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	take it to a pet shop and have someone who is knowledgeable trim them. If you cut to far down you can really hurt the bird and do damage.
SA5DeRpUaa	the betta should always have a heater.  make sure to keep the water clean but don't remove all the water because it might scare the betta.|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	it is really difficult to medicate such a small tank. if it is at all possible, can you get him into a bigger tank, completely empty tank just for medicating? only the tank, heater, maybe an air stone and fish.     you can get a plain 10 or 20 gallon at walmart, heck, get a big rubbermaid  storage bin, about 15 gallons in size....    make sure that the larger quarantine tank is still heated.     fish with a mouth fungus can't eat well, if at all. this needs to be taken care of quickly.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	My betta had white spots around its mouth and wouldn't eat and layed at the top of the tank and would only swim when I picked up the tank and latter died.
naVUguuHaa	Good luck "adopting" a designer dog. Those are rarely in shelters. Yon mean BUY one? Lol.    All the dogs you listed except the Lab need monthly grooming. I wouldn't keep a maltese, schnoodle, or a shitzu outside at night. They aren't built for that.|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Honestly, yorkies are the most high maintance...i have one. And border collie.      Get a shi tzu, they can be very calm.|`|q0vKbocHaa	DO RESEARCH. I can't emphesis that enough, many many people just get a dog without doing their homework and then they find that its too much to handle. I would personally take a breed selector test, they are a test that narrows down the search of the types of dogs that fit your lifestyle and then it makes it easier to do research on the breed itself. all you need to do is google "dog breed selector" and click on the animal planet one, it is pretty good. After you do that, research the breed you decided on, to make sure its a good match. Once you do that, buy all the things you need (you should by that time know what that is from all your research!) then you have to find a a breeder- now this can be tricky, there are many many bad breeders out there and you should go around and ask many questions to each of the breeders, just because you go to a breeders house to see the puppies, doesn't mean you have to adopt right then. Don't know what questions to ask? Do research on the tough questions to ask and what the answers should be. After you decided on a puppy, then (depending on when you pick out your puppy) you either take it home, or you wait until you can. Make sure you do research on how to train and handle your puppy, otherwise you'll be over-run in a few months when that cute puppy grows up. Make sure you also can afford a vet and decide on which vet to go to, remember-cheaper doesn't always mean better so make sure you go look around at your local vets to make sure you'd pick the right one. If your going to do a shelter dog, you simply have to know what your getting into, so if you would want a shelter dog, do research (yes I know, so much research!) on shelter dogs.     -Don't get dogs from a pet shop, they are from puppy mills! PUppy mills are bad.    -Shoondles aren't a breed, they are a mutt. Just like the dogs at a shelter|`|MJnF0pfFaa	Yorkshire Terriers  and Poodles are fantastic !!!|`|tsLpK2ABaa	Deciding on which Breed to Adopt depends on your lifestyle.Since you wont be home much you may want a "Lazy" Breed.

I recommend a French Bulldog, A little wrinkly But overall good dogs,Hope you Enjoy the Life with a Dog!|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,    There are a lot of things to consider in picking the right breed for you.  First you may research about the breed of your choice if it really fits your lifestyle.  Here's a lot of tips to help you decide, check this out:    http://tinyurl.com/57nx7h|`|cmNQJjEbaa	A maltese is not the right chose for you. They don't do well alone, period. That's why you seem them shopping with their owners at malls in a bag. Maltese hair is a pain to manage. They are very high maintenance and get matts(or knots in their hair) very easily. They are not outdoor dogs, they do not have fur like most dogs, they have hair(like human hair) so they get cold easily. That's why you see alot of them with sweaters or coats outside. No small dogs under 10 pounds are outdoor dogs. There have been so times when uneducated owners leave small dogs outside, unsupervised or supervised, and they have become food for predators like coyotes and large birds. Just a month ago a friend of mine was walking her maltese outside on a leash, and a coyote came out of a bush and took her malt away. She looked around for hours, days, weeks but she never found him.     Please do your research! Judging by your life style, you should no get any dog under 15 pounds! It can mean life or death for the dog!|`|o2ekfo8Faa	First, you should look up info on the breeds you like. You said you like dogs like the maltese. Dogs like this tend to be high maintenance, and would most likely not do well living outside. Schoodles are NOT a breed, and I would not recommend getting one as the main breeder of them tend to be puppy mills. Of the 4 you mentioned, a labrador would be your best bet.    Still, before you get any dog, make sure you can afford it first. Then make sure you know everything you need to know about the breed you're getting, and that you'll be able to provide everything it needs, attention included. Many breeds cannot handle being left alone for long periods of time. Once you've done your research, you'll be more able to pick out one that will fit your lifestyle.    Whether you buy or adopt from the shelter, it's best to know what you're getting into. Best of luck!|`|VDy99i3oaa	From what you're saying, it sounds like you need a calm dog who can handle being alone, so an older one would be your best bet. Go to the nearest animal shelter and talk to them about their dogs. Because so many people want puppies there are a lot of older dogs that are looking for a home. Ask the people there about the temperament of their dogs, they'll give you the best advice. As for the breed, there are so many beautiful dogs at the shelter, just go and see which one really touches your heart and it won't matter what his or her breed is.|`|bRisWd7Qaa	Well most of the smaller breeds are high maintenance like the Maltese as the hair will need seasonal clipping daily grooming and bathing every week,  try looking up these web sites they may help you.    http://www.findmeapet.com.au/canine/reso...    http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/search.htm    http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...    goodluck =)|`|AA11546927	I don't mean to sound like a downer- but if you know you wont be home much or if you plan on leaving it outside to live/sleep there may not be a breed that would like that lifestyle.  Many dogs develope horrible habits from boredom such as chewing, digging, barking and howling- and it's not their fault.  My lab ate the screens from the back doors, chewed the side of the house and broke all of the flower pots.  And he got attention!  I would suggest reading up on owning dogs and come up with a way for you to be able to tolerate a dog in your home.  If you or someone that lives with you is scared or allergic- rethink it all together.

TlhL0xFwaa	A lot of it depends if you are going to heat it or not. If not, 2 goldfish or a school of minnows would be a logical choice. I have a goldfish, 3 corydora catfish, 1 brisstlenose pleco and I used to have a school of minnows. If you are going to heat it, you can put some tetras, mollies, minnows, a betta or any schooling fish. You should ask the clerk he will be able to help you out more than anybody on the internet. If I was asking to your face it would be easier, Just be sure to ask whatever questions that crosses your mind. For decorations you can do just like I did, Find some sand for the bottom, about a quarter inche, then add some gravel of your choice untill you have 2-3 inches of stuff on the bottom, And for plants and decorations, 2 live plants, a few plastic plants , I have 7 in a 30 gallon, and a few monuments that create cave like hiding places.

be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Oh, yeah! She's in heat!!|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	It's heat.  Have her spayed ASAP.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Sound like it! Please save her the misery and have her spayed<br>  <br>  Here are some others:<br>  It is fairly easy to tell when your female cat is in estrus, because all cats in heat display similar symptoms. <br>  The first sign is that the cat will become overly affectionate and rub her rear and even head or neck against all objects, other cats and her owners. <br>  The easiest and most obvious way to tell when your cat is in heat, is the call. Your cat will produce a very different, loud long howl. This is to let other male cats in the area know that she is in estrus and her calling will continue until she mates. <br>  A cat in heat will also bend her body in a mating position, with her rear raised, tail in the air and tread around in the same place. <br>  She also lifts her tail and sprays urine on objects. This is usually done on vertical objects like walls, doors and furniture rather than on the floor or carpet. This urine usually has a more serious odor than the odor left when urinating normally. Cat urine produced when in heat contains more estrogen, and this extreme cat urine smell lets male cats know your cat is in heat. <br>  If your female cat shows most of these above symptoms, the chances are almost 100% that she is in heat! <br>  Male cats that notice a female cat in heat will also change their behavior. They will become more restless and also spray their urine on objects. They may also start calling and howling, becoming more aggressive and territorial.|`|hGY08GjRaa	That's typical of being in heat<br>  <br>  Also alot of meowing.. alot of sticking her bum in the air, especially if anyone/thing touches her..<br>  <br>  Sounds like it<br>  <br>  Please get her fixed.. or she'll drive you nuts and get cancer when she's older...|`|JRRsjByCaa	cats that aren't fixed do this, female cats...please get your cat spayed so that she doesn't have to go through the torture of being in heat.|`|BBZj7m0kaa	check out this site|`|d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	1) What is "in heat"? <br>  The fertile period of a female cat's reproductive cycle (the mating period) is called estrus, commonly referred to as "heat or being "in season". It's equivalent to human menstruation. <br>  2) When does a cat come into heat?<br>  The average female cat has her first cycle at about 6 months of age. <br>  <br>  3) What are the symptoms?<br>  Females bleed from the vagina sometimes with swelling of the vulva and increased urination. Cats bleed less than dogs, and rarely will you see any signs of it. <br>  Cats in heat will be more affectionate & more vocal. They will roll around on the ground and rub up against you incessantly. Other than behavioral changes, the most noticeable symptom may be male cats hanging around your house. <br>  <br>  4) How long are cats in heat?<br>  They may stay in heat from a few days up to 3 weeks. How long depends on many variables such as genetics, environment and cat health & age. <br>  <br>  5) How often will she be in heat?<br>  Cats go into heat most often in spring & fall. During this period a cat can perpetually go in & out of heat until she is bred or spayed, usually about every other week. <br>  <br>  6) Can she get pregnant her first cycle?<br>  Yes. However, most breeders generally would not breed a cat that early. After the cat has reached a year old and gone through a few heats is the best time. They are physically & emotionally mature enough to handle motherhood. <br>  <br>  7) What age can I have my cat spayed?<br>  People used to be told to let their cat go through at least one cycle or let them have one litter. Today, veterinarians are doing it much earlier. Some spay as early as 5-6 weeks of age! The most common age is at 6 months.<br>  Cats can be spayed at any time during their life with the only concern being the natural risks involved with surgery on an aging cat. <br>  <br>  8) Can I have her spayed while she's in heat?<br>  it's a bit more complicated and most vets prefer to wait between heat cycles.. Just check your vet's policy on this. They probably can, but might charge a bit more as the risk of bleeding complications is a little higher during the heat cycle. <br>  <br>  9) My cat just had kittens. When can she be spayed? Spay your cat about 2 weeks after the kittens have been weaned. <br>  <br>  10) How will the surgery affect my cat? Cats that have not been spayed find the whole estrus cycle uncomfortable. They are in a perpetual state of hormonal flux, which can lead to irritability. Having her spayed will alleviate some of these symptoms. Some cats might gain a little weight after the procedure as the heat cycle tends to curb their appetite.|`|BS6tLSGJaa	yes this is surely one of the symptoms of a cat in heat.another is that he meows in really strange voices....horrible sometimes....

lhOd2hvXaa	A bored Australian Cattle Dog (blue heeler) is going to try to make their own fun.  That sounds like the case with your little guy.  ACDs need both physical and mental stimulation to be happy.      If you don't even have time to walk him then yes the kindest thing to do is to find him a good home.

If you can't care for him, give him to some one reliable like a local rescue shelter.They will adopt him to a home who will be happy to care for him.  If you feel attached to him, and don't want to let him go you'll have to adjust your daily schedule to make time for our dog. If you can't care for your dog, it might be better off with someone who can.  I don't want to make the decision for you, but whatever you do, adjust your schedule or give him away, remember you are doing it for his well being.|`|AA10112346	If you can't care for it give it to someone who can.

This is a decision to discuss with a vet or an animal psychologist, not some random people sitting at home on a sunday afternoon.It's all up to if your willing to change or not for your dog and if you live him/her.  TALK TO A VET!|`|q043PtFuaa	find him a good home where he will be treated better. you dont have time for this dog and to keep it on a chain is down right crual. find him a good home and do a check on these ppl, do your  home work, you owe it to that dog at the least!!!|`|1mYIF1uYaa	You can maybe try make a big area for your dog to   hang around (in the day) then chain him up in the night.  If you don't have time like that, then it's fine. Chaining dog up is   not cruel. It is completely normal for dogs.   If you feel that it is still cruel, give him some love.  Play with him, spend more time.   He will understand :D|`|IBEl08szaa	It's okay my dog jumps the fence in my yard so i just put a chain on him it's long enough so he can go through the whole yard and he's happy, and doesn't even seem to notice it (unless he gets it wrapped around the tree :) and if you play with him he probaly still has fun. If he's one already you can't get rid of him he's already attached to you AND THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR IF YOU GAVE HIM TO SOMEONE ELSE|`|YPlYfwvSaa	Have you tried using an electric fence? If you put up the flags, and train him with it a few times, teaching him where the fence is, he will learn where his boundaries are.     Another thing you could do instead of a chain is a running lead.  It is a lead that is suspended in the air, and has a wheel on it.  You can rope it around a certain area in the yard...as long as you want it and in a closed shape, and he can run a larger distance than on just a chain attached to the ground.  It is not necessary to have trees and such, you can use a pole with an eye hook and such.      If you love him, don't give him up. Just look for different options.  Your local pet store/dog trainers will be able to help you with these things too. Don't give up yet.  He is still young too. He just needs to be taught where his boundaries are.|`|yjT6ToTCaa	Your dog has needs and if you can not fulfill them then he needs to go where some one can take care of him. He is getting out of your yard because of lack of exercise  or prey drive and needs to be trained not to leave the yard, but this takes commitment on your part and not just playing inside is going to fix this. Either get help to get him trained or find a rescue to help you find a good owner for him that is the right thing to do.Pets require time and money and most of all your heart.|`|ozjOc623aa	Honey i got you on this one i went through the same thing the best thing to do is give him away . its hard at first but then you get used to it. but you could also try training him be cruel not to cruel but let him know your the master and he has to listen to you.|`|f8F9l8ylaa	I feel bad for ALL animals who have to be chained up, and just think. How would you feel if you were the one who had to be locked up? I would give him to a close friend of yours who can actually be trusting. If your dog looks sad that he is locked up, let him play and run around, and when you let him go out, watch him. You don't have to give him away, unless need to. I would also recommend that you go to a store that has housing things, and I would buy a taller fence if I were you. So I actually WOULD keep your dog, as long as you don't chain him up. And you can also distract him if he looks like he is going to run away. So good luck with your dog, and give him a BIG hug. I am POSITIVE that he would absolutely love that.

kUnvlr3Oaa	Hi... :)  Your sure he doesn't have fleas (he is on Frontline or Advantage)?  It is most likely an allergy.  What are you feeding him?  Does it include anything with wheat or corn in it?  I would give your vet a call to be sure though....|`|tRfgwT5saa	Miniature schnauzers tend to get skin problems really easily, so you might want to call up your vet and describe your dogs symptoms.|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	What are you feeding him? If its not organic or raw. Then start with that. Schnauzers do not do well eating wheat gluten or corn, and develop allergies as a result. Here is what I feed. Raw chop meat with what veggies I am having. When I am not making him something special I use Timber Wolf.     You always can just give him a bath|`|X0kqaRRaaa	If he doesn't have fleas, it could be "hot spots". Depending on the dogs size, you can give him a benadryl; which is commonly used for itching.  But, you may want to be on the safe side and get a recommendation from his vet (if you have one already).  The benadryl may make him a little sleepy, but see if he scratches as much.

SZOMVGBRaa	You need to know how many gallons of water your tank is for allot of reasons but most of all so you know how overstocked you are. Unless you have a 120 gallon tank now and are planning on upgrading you don't have enough room for all the fish you have. But that's a whole other rant I will go on at some other time.     To your question, NO, don't get another gourami. The one you have isn't gonna last long in that tank anyways. You don't have a community tank either, what you have Is a Cichlid tank that has bottom dwellers and silver dollars that can tolerate cichlids and a gourami now who's way outta place. Hes not an aggressive or fast or bottom dwelling fish. As your Cichilds grow they are going to get more aggressive towards all the other fish and him. They will kill themselves off too, unless you have a HUGE tank. It may be fine now and for awhile but its going to happen and when it does your gonna lose fish.     Good Luck with everything

They would sit at my feet and wait for little treats which of course I gave as I filled their bowl.  Then they would just run around the house for about an hour.

The key to these potentially loveable pets is getting them used to human contact right away. get one young and handle it a lot. they're quite skiddish at first as they don't have great eyesight and the slightest move can make them quill up...initially. just handle them a lot and get them used to your smell and they'll come around. a fun thing to do with them out of their cage is to build a maze or plenty of obstacles for them to climb up or get past. you'll see how smart they can be.    next, when it comes to messes, the only big potential mess that i ran across was luckily preventable. you can train them to use a litter box but again you have to start them right from the beginning. if not you'll be stuck with a hamster wheel full of hedgehog poop...that they run on all night long...can we say one big skid mark? lol just remember, this pet can be trained at a young age and it's not that hard to do from what i've read.    the best part about this kind of pet is there's minimal expense. i think mine was about $250 for her and all equipment and food and wood chips were not expensive at all.    whether you choose a hedgehog or go a different way, happy pet hunting!|`|OYcB4rvraa	A hamster  A gold Fish  A Guinea Pig  A Lizard  A Snack  A bird/ parrot|`|AAWM7WbMaa	gerbils. they are adorable but you should keep them in a pair of the same gender.

For average home ponds, use an icecube tray- 1 cube every couple of days should be enough. For smaller tanks, just lay some flat on a tray and freeze it, and keep it in a baggie in the freezer. Give the tadpoles a pinch every few days.  Remember: too much food will get the water all dirty, and too little will make the tadpoles get nutty and go after each other. If your water gets dirty really fast, slow down on the feeding...and be sure to replace the dirty water with some fresh spare water.

jV7SmnaTaa	Ok...no question is stupid.    Next, your trotting is correct. Sometimes though we post the collected trot - it depends.    For a flying change of the right to the left lead.       - Confirm the aids of the right lead canter:     The horse is straight, calm and balanced,   The right leg is at the girth, relaxed.   The left leg is slightly behind the girth,   The left shoulder is slightly moved back,   There is a tad more weight on the left buttock,   The contact with the outside (left) rein is slightly stronger.     - Simultaneously invert all the aids:     The right shoulder moves back and the weight shifts on the right buttock,   The right leg lightly touches the horse behind the girth,   The left leg goes to the girth,   The horse is slightly counter bent to the left,   The contact with the right rein is slightly stronger.     Now...I would highly recommend that you get a copy of Sally Swifts book called Centered Riding. We used it in my college riding classes and it was great. It goes step by step through all sorts of dressage moves (that can also be used for over fences). It's an easy read, but is great for even the advanced rider.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	the first answer says it all!|`|VqFzDnvOaa	you're not stupid! these things are hard at first until you get the feel of them.    flying lead change: you need to make sure your horse has already been trained to do this. or else you're going to waste a lot of energy. haha. pick up a canter and once you get a good pace going and you don't feel like your horse will break any time soon, push your horse into the center of your arena (like your doing a figure 8) using your outside leg. You know how when you pick up an inside lead, you squeeze with your outside leg and pick your inside rein up and over? basically to do a flying, you just switch it. you're gonna wanna squeeze really hard with the leg you weren't using before. it's just really important to keep up a good speed!    collected trot: how you position your body is really going to effect how your horse moves.  you're gonna wanna "sit deep" in your saddle. which basically means keep your butt under you (awkward sounding i know..). if you ever ride in jeans, just make sure your sitting on the pockets of them. next, you want to keep your legs down and still against your horses side.  separate your hands and pull them back gently kinda towards your thighs. as you pull, gently squeeze on your horses sides with your legs. this should slow down the pace, keep their head down, and really help them push forward with their back legs (which can be more difficult for english horses).    extended trot: first, get a normal trot going. however you post, you're horse is going to try to keep in stride. so, if you stay up out of your seat a little longer by coming up a little further, your horse should start to extend it's gate. to get a nice speed going, keep squeezing (or even kicking). you can do this every time you sit in your post. also, keep a longer rein so your not pulling back on the bit at all.     it takes some practice, just don't give up.  good luck. hope this helps.|`|mq21qSmAaa	You aren't stupid :)  just inexperienced.    Flying lead changes were introduced to me in my second year of riding.  But it really depends on your level, your trainer, horse, etc    Collected trot and extended trot are more advanced movements.  A lot of non-dressage trainers won't even teach it, which I do not agree with.  Ask your trainer if she does and if she doesn't, look around for a good dressage trainer.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	Flying lead changes- not all horses do them automatically (actually, most don't when riding), but essentially, you ask for the other lead canter cue at the center of the figure 8. The easiest way is to start with a simple change (through a few strides of trot) and then decrease the amount of trot strides inbetween.    Collected trot: You can post if you want, but by the time they ask for this in dressage, you are sitting most of the trots anyways. You are wrong however- it is not a slower smaller step thing- the horse is moving it's legs just as much as in the working trot, but they are more elevated and in shorter strides- you should feel a lot of energy in them, spring-like, not a slowing down.    Extended trot-  hard to do (your horse has to sit way back on it's haunches, and is a 2nd level movement).   Your description works better for a lengthening trot- where the whole body (and strides) lengthen. You are not going any faster than you were at the working trot. Basically you ask for more with your leg, and half-halt with your outside rein to pick the horse up a bit more than a regular trot.|`|rZPmo1Wzaa	you're not stupid. my first year of riding was filled with loads of questions kinda like this!    flying lead changes- you've got the right idea for sure, but they are an advanced movement that requires a lot of practice and patience. it took me almost 5 months to train one of my horses to do them well, and if your horse doesnt know how to do them, then you giving it a cue isn't going to change anything. one of the previous posters has the technique correct, so i wont go into that. my horse and i can now do tempi lead changes- which is just doing multiple flying lead changes in a row (the horse looks like he's skipping! its so funny!)    collected trot- it doesnt have to be sitting- many horses learn it better if you post at first. the stride length is slightly shorter but not too much. the horse reaches under himself more with his back legs, and it is a slower gait.    extended trot- easily done posting but in high level dressage tests it is always done sitting. the horse again reaches under himself more with his hind legs but this time he reaches out with his front legs too and really opens up his stride. do not let the horse drop his head low and 'fall onto the forehand' (get heavy on the reins) this is not good. DO keep their head under control as you ask them to step out a bit faster and use teir back legs. probably the easiest thing to do of the three.    flying lead changes are very spectacular in dressage, but are very handy in hunter/jumper courses when you have to make tight bends around the course. the extended trot is a nice ground-covering stride if you like to go on the trails, and the collected trot can help a horse learn to balance better.    PLEASE do not try any of this without and instructors advice first! these are things that require a well trained horse and good technique so please have a knwledgeable horse person around to help you if you ever want to try any of this!|`|7RxUn7g0aa	okay so don't worry about the questions they are not stupid. In fact for the amount of time that you have been riding I am quite impressed. :) You pretty much got the collected and extended trot correct.    Collected Trot:  The collected trot is when you ask the horse to shorten their stride w/out losing the impulsion. You want to maintain the impulsion so that he/she will be able to move onto the next thing that you ask while being balanced. Impulsion is when you are basically packaging your horses energy. Collected Trot does not necessarily mean that you are sitting, but that is typical.    Extended Trot:  The extended trot is when you are asking your horse to open up their stride. Extended trot does not mean that your horse's legs are moving faster, their stride is simply longer therefore covering more ground.    Flying Lead Changes:  I have been riding for around 9 years (never owned my own horse therefore limited in what I am able to do based on the horses abilities) and I have only just been asked to perform the flying lead changes. True, flying lead changes are when a horse is asked to change leads while cantering. In a way, you can look at a flying lead change as if you were at the trot asking for your new lead. It is a good idea to start out learning to do a flying lead change on a figure eight so that you and your horse can see that you need to change leads in order to change direction. Pick up your canter going along the rail and then canter around until you are at the center of your figure eight and then begin the figure eight. Normally, you would be asked to come back to the trot and then swap leads. Instead you will ask the horse for a change in bend and use your aids to pick up the other lead. A flying lead change is typically used when jumping a course and your horse lands on the incorrect lead. In that case, ask for the lead change BEFORE the corner and then continue on. It is never a good idea to let your horse canter a corner on the incorrect lead because they will be unbalanced.
Km6gOd61aa	1.It should be fine just make sure you play with it about 2-3 hours a day.    2.They have a natural odor like all animals but it's not that bad and some bite but only if they are nervous or are just being territorial.    3. Well first costs are about $80-150. The cage for a good one is about $50, also the guinea pig can be from $20-40! Food is about $10 for a big bag and a water bottle food dish and all that stuff are about $15 and bedding is another $10. So your first cost will be about $110. That's pretty good. Also monthly will be for food and bedding so that'll be about $20. My food normally lasts me 2 months so a little cheaper.And for those people who say you're supposed to change their food every day, NO! Only when it gets really low. There is no sense of wasting food like that!    Hope this helps|`|bicAgoycaa	Fish aquarium for a cage... No. Their fecal matter has a smell to in and if you don't have ventilation it can get a little smelly and possibly toxic. You can actually litter box train guinea pigs... of course it's harder to do than a cat, but it's still possible. Cost depends on how much you care about animals. You need to clean their bedding every few days because they can get infections, mites, etc if you don't keep the bedding clean.    Look at is as if you were to be placed into a glass room, how would you like the smell of your feces versus something that would be open. Plus, no animal likes laying in their own waste so again, make sure you keep their cage clean.    They're great pets. I've never ever seen a mean guinea pig. You just have to make sure you take care of them.|`|OsWTsB9Xaa	well i have a hamster and they only smell bad if you dont clean the cage. one will be fine if you interact with if daily. they dont bite unles they are scared. you have to buy bedding every two weeks and food every other month so its not that much really. it will be alot better if you keep the cage in your room if your mom is scared, plus you will spend more time wth him or her if it is close to you. i suggest not to use an aquaium. it will smell awful! hope i helped. good luck.|`|tEhJ3v99aa	I had one and he seemed real happy. I held him daily and loved him a lot. They can be real cuddly. You need to clean the cage every 3-5 days and you won't have any smelly problems. Mine used to get a warm bath every month and loved it.The bigger cage the better. No fish tanks, please they need room to play and run around. He is not on display like a fish. Food will run about 6 bucks a month. Make sure he gets fresh water every day, every day, o.k. The only place NOT to put one is in a drafty place. They can not take drafts, they will pass away if put in a drafty place. (Door, open window etc)  Enjoy, they are lots of fun.   Oh yes.  When you put them down on the floor  to play put a large old blanket down as they will poop-ie as they run around. They are solid little things so it is easy to take it out side and shake it off. Feed them only good quality Guinea Pig food. A little fruit once in a while and buy your self a little book on how to raise them. It will be very worth it for your piece of mind and the health of your new member of the family.
c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	Without seeing a picture it's hard to tell you what it is.  My guess is it could be a wound from pulling shed skin off, and that wound has scabbed over.  If you could post a picture of it, it would help.  Good luck.  If it's just a scab, there's nothing to worry about.  It'll heal by itself and should be fine without intervention.|`|tBJZ3RtQaa	Well it could just be that her tail was like that be4 and its a marking on her
qW0tq6A2aa	KMR!! (white can with an orange tabby kitten on it) it stands for Kitten milk replacer... you can find this in a petsmart or petco... warm it up and mix it in with some wet food (canned kitten food)    if she doesnt eat it... dip her head into it and it forces her to lick her lips and almost all kittens will then start eating.    and as far as the crying... i recommend a heating pad. this makes the kitten feel as though she is with her mother and other kittens... blankets and what not are helpful too... let her sleep a lot as well.    kittens will eventually grow out of this. they are much like puppies in this sense because when they get taken away from their mother and litter they can become very distressed and upset.     just give her lots of attention and definitely give her the KMR.... it also has the vital nutrients that kittens need in it!    GOOD LUCK!|`|Kus73aMQaa	It sounds like she was taken to soon. There are several things you can do to comfort little kitty. Be with her as much as you can during the day so she knows she isn't alone.    As for food. Take and eye dropper (Clean) and feed her pet milk. You can get pet milk at most pet stores. Do that for awhile. Then when you think she is ready to eat harder food try canned soft food then work your way to hard food.    When you first start the hard food add a little pet milk to it to soften it.|`|AA11707728	Cats are social animals, especially when they are young.  If she's away from her mother than you need to spend most of the time she is awake with her.  She especially needs to be touched alot and have contact with your body, particularly at night.    She might be too young to be weaned yet.  Go to the pet store and get some kitty formula or something and feed it to her with a baby bottle.  In a few weeks she should be able to eat solid food.|`|R1JK7eZhaa	if you are feeding it hard food then add some water ontop she also might be crying because she wants atention or when you leave she gets scared.|`|j7PtOkxLaa	Try taking her onto your lap with a bottle or an eyedropper of warm pet milk and giving it to her, because maybe she misses that. Try to be with her as much as possible. She's just really upset and sad! Imagine if you were suddenly taken away from everything you knew, it would be hard, so try and make this little kitten feel at home.|`|3aNQIoplaa	If its hard food, she just may have a difficult time chewing it. When my cat was a kitten, I had to get the food wet by adding some water.     If that fails, maybe you could go to your local pet store and get some kitten formula/milk.    As for the crying, she probably just wants your attention and is having some separation anxiety from being taken away from her mom, brothers, and sisters. No need to feel guilty for having to walk away or leave the room. She'll most likely grow out of it sooner or later.
8owlj2xHaa	Most soft corals, except carnation or chili. Zoos, GSP, and most any polyp coral. I would avoid Zenia though, it grows very fast like a week and can take over a tank in a short time.  Here is a link to a beginner coral pack.  Good luck.    http://www.liveaquaria.com/product/prod_...|`|RXYZb6bsaa	Those corals will probably be ok if you have 70 or so watts.  Just fyi they say it takes one damsel per 5 gallons to cycle a tank.  You dont need any fish though.  You can just put food in the tank to feed the live rock
hlOawARXaa	I'm really not sure what you have, I wish I could help. I have a mini lop and one other rabbit that is calico and I'm not sure what kind of rabbit he is either. I'm guessing my calico is just a mixture of different breeds of rabbits, I bought him from a local petstore and they said he was a mini rabbit but there is nothing mini about him :).  I'm sure the vet could tell you what breed the rabbit is.    http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb191...    &    http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb191...|`|CqQ1DaKDaa	Here is a list of rabbit breeds:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rab...  After reading through, I only really found a lop rabbit to fit your description, yet I haven't seen the rabbit so I don't know.
yAsLhdp2aa	he is a nocturnal fish (if you are not aware of that). is he pale or discolored? how is his breathing? does he seem like his gills are working overtime? You feed him frozen bloodworms on a regular basis? What is the size of your tank?    it sounds like you know what you are doing with him..you have had him for 2 years..leave him in the tank and observe him all night. set your alarm and check on him every 1 hr or 2, just to make sure that he hasnt died and you can ensure prompt removal if he does..then do a normal 25% water change       Man, I am sorry, sounds like he may be dying. I have a rope fish myself.  Goggle and see what their expected life span is. I know they do better in larger tanks over 70 gallons. My rope is in a 20 with 2 angels and she (female) does real well.  I am one of those people who let my fish die in their own tanks if they are not showing any physical signs of illness. If you move him, it oculd stress him out more... Seperate if you feel you should, do whatever you usually do with a dying fish. Never flush a live fish of course. they can sometimes live for days in sewage.    make sure Your tank temp hasnt dropped.
dfb64b243bd35b4224dd85cc89895d3daa	I think your goldfish suffers from bladder problem, where there might be excess air in the blader. This problem might also be caused by feeding too much processed or pellet food or digestive problems (e.g.: bacteria).    Suggestions:    a) I have heard about the acupunture way, where some professionals in China poke the bladder to let the air escape. But I DO NOT recommend this method, as it is risky and tedious, leave this to the professionals, and it is not worth so much trouble/risk unless you have a hundred dollars goldfish.    b) Try feeding your goldfish with frozen food, normally live frozen food are easier to digest and this will certainly helps the digestive system.    During the bloating, feed the fish well, if you are lucky, your goldfish might survive when the extra air are expel by natural process.    http://www.goldfish-emergency.com/viewpa...    Good luck!|`|Y43nptlvaa	Give them sinking pellets from now on because they get to much air in their stomachs causeing there bladder to become filled with unneccasary air|`|Xe6vXrYjaa	he's having problems with his swim bladder.  this is usually due to over feeding.  make sure all water parameters (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate) are perfect and stop feeding for a day or so.  then try feeding him a cooked pea, without the shell, chopped up into little pieces.  this will help clear out his system.  then feed the peas for the next couple of days.     what kind of food do you feed your fish? floating flakes are the worst and dry pellets need to be soaked for about 5 minutes...otherwise the food swells up in the fish putting pressure on the swim bladder and causing the floating up and flipping.  I have a swim bladder sensitive fish so I know how frustrating it can be. Just try with the peas, feed less, and fast your fish at least one day a week and he should show improvement.      Hope I helped!
iiNAJfGCaa	Plan on spending a minimum of $200 a month on your horse if you keep him at home. This will include hay, feed, shavings, farrier care ever 6-8 weeks, worming, vet care, etc. Plan on spending upwards of $1000 to get yourself set up for a horse: building a suitable shelter, purchasing fencing, buying water buckets, troughs, stall mats, feed buckets, brushes, tack... the list goes on and on. The horse itself will be the cheapest part - I don't know about the prices in Australia, but you can buy a nice, decent beginner to intermediate horse for $1,500. As far as what "breed" you should get, I wouldn't necessarily limit myself to that... think of these other factors first: what will you need your horse to do? Do you want a trail horse, a horse to ride around at home on, a horse to compete with, etc.? Do you want a mare or a gelding? Or does it not matter? How big do you want your horse to be? How old? These are all factors that are more important than the breed. So basically your first months expenses (including the horse) will be $2,200+. You should also have an "emergency" vet fund of at least  $1,000.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Okay, so you ride english.  What dicipline?  (jumping, pleasure, eventing, dressage, ect??)  Well the breed doesn't matter as much as the horse.  I have an appaloosa who is probably the best english horse i know.  And I know some good western thoroughbreds.  Look more at conformation than you would breed!|`|YVNeeIIIaa	Prices you're going to have to look around and ask around because it varies with what dicipline you ride and what feed your horse requires...But for the breeds there is no "breed" for a beginning owner, it all depends on the horse and the history of the horse, etc...but a mostly quiet and easy keeper is the Quarter Horse  Good luck|`|VvpnsdZraa	It really depends on what type of riding you prefer.  Personally I am a stock breed person (Quarter horse, Paint)  They are athletic and versatile.  You can do rodeo events or pleasure, cow events, reining, or req. trail riding.    Thoroughbreds are good for eventing, but as a first horse i would not recomend, because they tend to be high strung.  (this is a generalization and there are exceptions out there)    Hay is about 200 a ton, farrier work between 65-100 depending on the farrier. Plus always acount for unexpected vet bills.  Tack is also expensive for a decent saddle around 500-1500.  If your horse needs grain, most 50lb bags of grain run around 35-45.    Good Luck!    Oh and I ride english as well and do so on Quarter Horses.  They do really good for lower level open breed competitions, and have the best mind out there (which is desirable in a first horse)|`|EghHVkHEaa	Warmbloods or a warmblood cross are my favorites. Depends on what kind of horse you get, breed, discipline, experience, but at the absolute minimum i would say roughly around $5,000; you can find some really good horses at 5k. As for tack also depends but if you plan on doing jumping as you said, saddle will cost min. 500 mabye, and with all the works (stirrup leathers, stirrups, name plate..) that will add mabye another 250. And for feeding, also it depends...different kinds of hay are different prices, as for grains, sweet feed, beat pulp, ect. - So i can't really give you all ball park guess with that one.     Best of luck.|`|vxhQWwaHaa	get an 10 year old arab      they live long and they gots spaz!!!!!|`|44ce4b4f563b74b283986cccbb8c7986aa	I think an older quarter horse would suit you. Maybe one around 5 that would be more settled yet young enough for the two of you to learn together.|`|fUEh0zS1aa	for my first horse i got a 3 year old quarter horse and she is perfect! i love her so much    arabs can be great um paints... almost any breed would be fine, its more the individual horse's personality and manner :)|`|SFfE6dOfaa	Well, i really like stock breeds like quarter horses, paints, buckskins, palominos, Appaloosas, pintos and the like... these horses can be good for english (i show my horse english pleasure and hunter/jumper and she's qh/paint). If you want to get into the tall jumps or dressage or such, qhs can still be good for this (many of the best jumpers and dressage horses r qhs) but you can also get a warmblood or a TB. Why i like the stock horses better is bc they tend to be a little more even tempered. TB and warmbloods can get a bit more hot and goey/spooky. But different ppl prefer different things, some ppl think that stock horses are too poky (even though i no a few that r really goey!) and some ppl think TBs r too crazy... it depends on the person. Also, it depends on the horse. No horse breed has all the horses exactly the same. My qh is way different than my friend's qh. Just like one of my friend's TB is way different than my other friend's TB. All horses r different, just like all ppl r different!     I looked up some hay prices for Australia, and found that hay there costs about 180-250 Australian $ a ton. An average horse will eat between 12-15 pounds of hay a day (varies from horse to horse) so you can assume that 1 ton of hay will last you about 133-166 days (according to 1 ton = 2000 lbs). Then grain or other feed with cost about $225 (australian $) to $375 a month. So for food you'll spend about $270-$425 a month.     Then you have to pay for farrier. I don't know how much a farrier will cost in Australia, but in the USA (where i live at least) farriers cost between $90-$800 every 6 weeks, or in Australian $, $135-$1,200. The prices will vary, but i think it's safe to assume that if you aren't getting anything over the top or don't need any speacial work done, it will cost between $100-$400.    Vet bills will vary. You will need to give your horse vaccinations and wormer and other vitamines. You will probably spend about $50-$250 a month on general vet bills. But if your horse colics, gets sick, becomes lame, or something else, vet bills will get big fast! When my horse had a minor colic, it cost us $500, and insurance covered several 100...    Do you have a barn for your horse? Feed bins? Water bins? Stalls? fencing? all of these will cost! If you have a stall, you have to have shavings which will cost you about $130 a month. If you don't have feed bins you'll have to buy them. it will cost about $300 for a feeder and about $300 for a waterer. If you don't have a barn or shelter for your horse, then you'll have to build one. You'll have to pay for labour or do it yourself and pay for supplies. Most small barns (2-3 stalls with small tack and hay storage) will cost about $35,000 us, i don't know what the price difference would be for Australian $. For just a shelter it would cost a lot less. Maybe only $2,000... idk    Then tack... oh tack... to get a decent english saddle will cost you between $700-$1,500 (at least that's prices in US, but you can probably get the same prices online, but that would be $1,050 to $2,250 Australian $)... then briddles cost about $200 to $400. Then a bit will cost about $100 to $200. Then boots will cost about $100 to $300. Then a helmet will cost about $130-$250. Then a saddle pad will cost between $30 and $200. Then a crop or spurs or other aids will just go on top of that cost. Same with horse boots and anything else you might need.    In the end, it gets really expensive! so i think you'r total tack cost will be about $1460-$2850. Then if you need to build a barn or shelter that will be between $2,000 and $50,000. And if you need a feeder and waterer that's another $600. Then your monthly horse care bill will be about $485-$1525... as you can see, horses r expensive pets!
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	An hour? that is not normal. Usually it takes 24-48 hours for the next egg. There can only be one egg in their system at a time. If she is still straining, you need to get to a vet, something else may be stuck in there.    Anyways, you need to modify her behavior to stop laying eggs. Egg laying is dangerous and depletes her calcium levels, causing brittle bones. I would let her incubate the eggs, and if you can get any fake eggs to put in there about the same size, she will lay less. Most birds go for a clutch size, and will quit when they reach it. If you keep removing the egg, she will keep laying to replace them. After a month or so of sitting (and she may be moody during this time) she will realize they won't hatch and will ignore them- you can then throw them out.        To change her behavior to stop laying eggs, you need to make it seem like it would be a bad idea right now- change around her cage, increase night time hours, less soft foods for a couple weeks, etc- anything that could be associated with spring and laying eggs.|`|OLAtwLV6aa	leave it there for a couple of days she'll just keep laying them also give her calcium supplement like cuttle-bone or she'll lose lots of calcium|`|d6540a8bbea9e9e8753fe90f3880cfc3aa	don't take the egg away that will get her depressed the same thing happened with my bird let her keep it until she notices it wont hatch and she will stop paying attention to it then take it away
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	If they are just tilted back, she is listening. If they are pinned back flat against her head, that usually means they are angry or aggressive.    That being said, for whatever reason, my mother's gypsy drum comes up to you with her ears pinned back, but no other aggression, and is usually coming up looking to be pet or scratched. I think that is just the way she walks, but to anyone who doesn't know her, they would think she was coming to attack them with her ear posture.
AA11565057	Don't get a rat.     Actually, don't get any sort of mammal. The cost of the pet isn't the main factor. You would need to buy their housing (for a rat, be prepared to spend at least $100-$200 for a decent cage), you need to pay for vets (Do you have a couple hundred dollars to spend on vet fees in case of emergencies).    I would suggest you don't get a pet if 'cheap' is your main criteria. Pets aren't cheap, not if you want to be a good pet owner and be able to care for it in case of emergency. Maybe an ant farm or silkworms would be ok, but steer clear of any mammals or fish or any other creatures that need vetinary care at all! Don't become one of those horrible pet owners who whines about lack of money when something goes wrong and lets their pets suffer or die because they can't afford vet care.     I'm really glad you asked this question :)|`|Z5A33IR3aa	then get one d bag|`|ojKmXu3waa	ant farm?|`|bicAgoycaa	Frogs are cheap. All you have to do is clean their water and feed them crickets. If you do get a frog though, don't put too many crickets into the tank at once because they could actually eat the eyes of a frog.    With as sporadic as our weather is here in Texas, it is kind of difficult to have a "cheap" pet here.. everything has to have temperature safe accommodations here with the way we go from sweater weather to shorts weather all in the same day.|`|KUc5ApNdaa	I have a mouse and a guinea pig!! Mice are cute and playfull! but they poop on you alot!!!|`|ZQ6JwJ25aa	Try Sea Monkeys.  They can be fun and are very easy to care for.  They are actually a kind of brine shrimp but they are fun to watch.  They need minimal care.    If you are a little more adventurous, I'd recommend a Guinea Pig.  A Guinea Pig makes wonderful noises and are very cuddly but they need daily care and feeding.     I have owned both and I liked them for different reasons.  However, I really prefer dogs and birds.  I own a 6 pound poodle and a love bird.  At lot would depend on what you want out of a pet and how much time you are willing to devote to its care and feeding.|`|OxOIhuXEaa	i like the suggestions antfarm and sea monkeys    they are pretty cool    even though they don't sound very interesting    xD|`|zhFIDSULaa	No pet is gonna be 'cheap'.  They all come where you have to get a medication plan, shots, food, housing, bedding, etc.etc. ... I have 2 gerbils and they still cost alot!  I think they were about 14 dollars each but then their house was 30 and then plus food and water and bedding each month.  Also, I just got a small dog today, and I ended up having to spend 500 dollars for the shots, medication, and everything... You have to think about all this stuff before having one..  Some pets require different needs and surroundings so you'll have to research.  You can't just rush into this... You have to be aware, and responsible.    Put some thought into it.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	well i live in texas and I think it would be ok to have a rat. they are very to take care of. you hae to have a cage for it and they never bite they are very friendly and i guess that would be great but you could also get a dog. that would be nice go to aspca and get an animal. they are nice and if you get one that is house trained its beter not sure if anyone is home during the day. but they make nice pets and protect the home if you need them to. they can be on eof the family fast. there are so many pets ou t there that need homes and they are good animals.|`|VF5Htmovaa	A gerbil. They are only $10 dollars. They are so fun.  Gerbils are social, athletic, active, curious, bold, and extremely cute little rodents. Gerbils live in "clans" or family units of two or more.

Is she still acting normally? Does she still play? Is she sleeping a lot?|`|kBjzKyZyaa	Chihuahuas can be very picky eaters and once they find a food they like they will refuse to eat anything else, but to be on the safe side you can take her to the vet for an oral check up and teeth cleaning. as far as the whining are you picking her up and babying her every time she is whines? If you are shes probably just doing it for attention, and knows that if she whines that you'll drop whatever your doing and show her attention.|`|97sZDDUZaa	Yes, my chihuahua-yorkie puppy use to whine alot and the bredder said that if he doesnt eat cook up some instant rice and he should eat that.

e6wo7czgaa	If you got the same budgies from the same pet store there might be your problem there. As you know birds hide their illness, ask around to see if it might be the pet store.  If your still not sure go somewhere else. I would also like to point out that yes drafts can get the bird sick, but also being overheated does that. They need natural lighten as well. It might even be accidental poisoning. This can be caused by spoiled food or other poisonous substances near them. Even in pet stores you should watch out if theres anything near the food that can be harmful to the bird.  Aspergillosis could also be the case; this is brought about by the respiration of spores like fungus. Certain plants help bring about this fungal infection.  The spores have poisonous toxins that damage the tissues in the lungs, nostrils, head cavities, air sacs, trachea, syrinx (voice box) this will build up a yellow cheeselike pus, causing the bird to have a harder time breathing. These plants belong to the Asperula.  There might even be bone fractures that have occur, even torn muscles or wing injuries that haven't properly healed before you bought them. You should get a special cleaner for your cage though, get every small crack, then try again to get another bird form a different pet store.  get ride of any toys from previous birds or items that mites could have attach themselves to, even close to the cage or carpets that are below.  And you should check around your house for mold and , not trying to scare you, but toxic chemical release around that area too. Evening smoking will harm the bird, any kind of smoke.  Even the treats could be harmful.  Just double check around, better safe right?|`|bTvrv59saa	Don't buy them at a pet store!!!!! They don't clean the cages good enough. And you also have to SCRUB THE CAGE WITH BLEACH.|`|Hv7L5CrGaa	I'm really sorry about that. There are many dangers to birds, such as: other big animals (dogs, cats, etc.), potted plants that are poisonous, electrical wires, zinc, and certain types of fruits. I hope you didn't feed it avocado, because it harms the budgie. Maybe the shop that you buy your budgies from is not a good one, and the budgies they sell there are all very ill.  The budgies might have gotten some kind of illness. Next time you buy a budgie, check to see if its healthy. Clean feathers, bright eyes, clean cere, active, and alert are the signs of a good healthy budgie. Clean the cage often, make sure your dog doesn't attack the budgies, and check if they are eating/drinking properly. I know it's frustrating, I've gone through death/fly aways of my pet birds. I hope you feel better, and the next budgie you buy won't end up dead so fast!|`|7HEZhx46aa	Are you burning scented candles or incense in the same room? Is anybody in the area smoking (cigars, cigarettes, ANYTHING)? ARe you spraying cleaners or air fresheners? IF you answered yes to any of these questions, THAT is killing your birds.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	Maybe they are already sick when you bought them or they are stressed with the surroundings. Can you tell me if you did some activities with them? Like that, i can interpret. Examples are taking it out to play, contact with another animal or something?|`|vaulPrAmaa	keep them in a large cage, not cooped up.  birds have to fly.  don't pamper so much.  natural light, talk to them, attention, and fresh air.  clean with hot water/vinigar, not chemicals|`|Vl2Z390Eaa	:( thats sad. i wouldnt blame you. sounds to me like you have a good setup. i think its the birds from the petshop. petshops dont look after them the best and they could have infections. it may not look like they do because they hide and sicknesses. i would ask for a refund and try buying them from somewhere else|`|LfNaScTJaa	A healthy budgie will have nice clean  bright eyes , not watery or glazed over look to them. It's backside will be clean from any droppings. An unhealthy bird will have a dirty backside. Crap stuck to the feathers around its backside. Have you had the house recently sprayed for vermin or even if you spray a surface spray for cockroaches etc. Contact with any poisons can cause death over a short time. The final point I will make now is one that most people don't know. If your cage is a galvanized cage you may need to wash it down with a vinegar and water mix to neutralize the zinc coating. Make sure the mix you are using is a good quality mix. And blow off old husks daily when you top up their feed. I sold a fellow I worked with 3 baby budgies in 3 weeks. When I asked him what was he was doing with them , he told me they kept dying. So I had a discussion with him on the matter. It turned out that he thought the wife was feeding the bird and the wife thought he was feeding it. When they checked the feed dish they were seeing husks and thinking it was food. Just a thought for new bird owners.
ptNy4uicaa	You don't want to attempt that. It really stresses them out and can be fatal. Just be patient and let nature take its course. They conserve all their energy to escape from their  exoskeleton. any moving that you do to it can be counterproductive to the enormous task of crawling out of your own skin. Make sure you keep them relatively more humid than usual to promote quick molting
ptNy4uicaa	Remove the spider from the terrarium. If they are baby tarantula the spider will probably eat them. If they are mites or insects then it's a bad situation because they will attack her. If you can take a picture of the "spiderlings" we might be able to tell you what it is. Otherwise just remove the spider and put in fresh substrate.    We have little bugs in our tanks from the plants and such. they aren't spiders and they don't hurt them... we don't know if this is what you have??!
ZzXK3nAAaa	If discipline doesn't work (and it had better, or this breed will run your whole life and drive every man away), LIGHTLY spray your blanket or quilt or bedspread with Bitter Apple (pet store)around the edges along the top of the mattress. Dogs and cats hate the stuff, but take it real easy and dilute it, or she won't come in your room at all. Try just the four corners as a start. If you don't do this, no man, not even a husband, will be allowed in your bed because the Dobie thinks it's her territory. But give her a consolation--2-3 ft. below the foot of your bed put an old blanket you've slept with for a few nights--your scent will keep her happy, because that plus your warmth is what she wants. She may be too big for a dog bed, too. Have two of these, so if one's in the wash and needs to get scented again (UNDER your blanket), the other will be on hand. Let me know how this works out.|`|ydshiNrKaa	She can sleep in her own bed on the floor.  My dog has his own bed in my room where he sleeps. it's much better for both of us as we don't bother each other is we are restless or can't sleep.|`|GoluIRIAaa	Get a bed for it or a blanket and set it on the floor it should get used to the idea after a little bit just don't keep giving in and letting her sleep on the bed with you let her know your in control and that's just the way it has to be she should be fine if it's in the same room as you so don't worry about feeling mean about it.|`|lHCZUPm2aa	You didn't ask a question.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Get a bigger bed.
9G03aQhsaa	Since you put another cat down recently, I think this could definately be part of the problem.  She may be marking the area as a way of helping her missing friend find its way home.  She could also be confused (at 16 she could be getting dementia).       Try thoroughly cleaning the spot with "Nature's Miracle" to remove the smell.  Next, put her food in that exact spot.  Cat's won't "go" where they eat. Also, give her extra attention since she is missing her friend.    You should also consult your vet as it could be  a sign of a urinary tract infection.    Good luck.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	At 16 years old, it could be an age thing, an urinary tract infection, or  emotional distress due to the loss of your other cat.  It's best to take her to the vet first.  If her health is good, try the below.  I did on the advice of my vet, and my problem was resolved the same day with no problems since then (it's been three months).    First, to get your cat to use the litter box again, try Dr. Elsey's Precious Cat Ultra Litter Attactant. It's a finely ground herb mixture that is sprinkled on top of regular cat litter and costs around $13.99 (one 20 oz. container treats 100 lbs. of litter). It also comes with a great brochure with all kinds of information about cats and litter box problems. This product works well with all sorts of litter box problems even with adopted feral cats (check out the consumer reviews on the Internet). I cleaned the litter box, put fresh litter in it, and my cat was in the box in less than one minute--no exaggeration.    Dr. Elsey's also makes a cat litter called Cat Attract. I haven't tried it but have heard it works very well too.    Second, no matter how well urine is cleaned up, even if you can't smell it, your cat still can and will continued to return to the same spots. Try Nature's Miracle to as a pretreatment to remove urine from anything that can be laundered, and just spray it on anything else that can air dry like the floor. It works by breaking down the enzymes in the urine so it not only removes the odor but keeps the cat from returning to the same spots. I used it on carpeting, several cat beds, blankets, and a mattress.    You should be able to get all of these products at PetSmart or any similar pet supply store. They are also available on the Internet.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	put her food in that area and she wont pee there. cats wont pee where they eat.    also she may have a infection. my cat started peeing on towels and things when he had one. we got him antibiotics and he stopped it.  id advise you to take her to the vets for a check up and see what they say about it.     i dont think its an age thing or she would be doing it everywhere.|`|Enr7zACMaa	This happened to my cat and all you have to do is clean the litter box more frequently. This worked for my cat.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	Getting rid of a 16 year old cat is not right. My cat was 20 years old when he died 7 months ago and it still hurts me to think of him. You should threat an older cat with more care and respect.     Try to clean that corner, maybe there is some sort of smell there that your cat finds annoying and it makes her pee.    Or try and put her litter box in that corner.    Cats are usually clean and smart animals, make sure that your cat is not ill or something. If she urinates more often than usual you better go to the vet, cause this may be symptoms of FLUTD!|`|A1CUNfNcaa	When a previously litter trained cat starts urinating on the floor it could be a sign that there is something wrong.  The most common reason for cats is a urinary tract infection.  You are right that it could also be her age.  I would definitely get her checked by the vet first and then go from there.  Good Luck!|`|wXaGIPSPaa	sometimes they start doing that because they have a bladder infection.   It burns when they urinate so they associate the pain with their litter box.   Id have the vet check her out. l6 is pretty old for a cat and you may be right it could have to do with her age too.  If her kidneys are starting to deteriate.    Good luck hon. Its so hard when our pets get old.  We love them so much and just wish they could stay with us forever and always in the condition they were in when they were young.    hope things work out for you both
C2kOCTVfaa	Whenever we lost our hamsters, we put out food that was sweeter than usual like fruit and just watched tv until they came out and started to eat.  It'll be okay!|`|Km6gOd61aa	First thing I want to say is calm down, I'm going to tell you everything you need to know.    -look under dressers, beds, counters EVERYTHING!!!!!  -If you have a 2 story they don't normally go up or down stairs so you need to look under everything on that floor.  -When my hamster got out my whole family pitched in to look for him.It was kinda sad though because he was in the cage the whole time. Make sure he did escape.  -Hamsters like hiding in corners or under anything they can get under  -they like dark places  -put some food out and a place that they sleep in.  -Check EVERYWHERE, I know this sounds like hard work but you need to do it.  -Also, I know you don't want to hear this but there could have been a way he got out of your house.      I know you'll find your hamster unless he got out. Check in cabinets and everything.    I don't really know what your house looks like so I can't tell you the places he would be.    Normally my hamster goes under my dresser but so far back you really have to get a flashlight to see.|`|HF0oDEd0aa	calm down iwish i could help but i dont know much about hammies except everything you placed up their sorry?|`|oOfTCWlEaa	Well hopefully you do not have a cat or a dog who may have found the hamster before you.  What I would do is buy a live mouse trap and put peanut butter in a little cup, they are also quite attracted to bananas.    Hope you find her!|`|A6ritUpHaa	I answered another of your questions... Go look. I left the best advice I could.    Good luck! I've got my fingers crossed!
9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Maybe zeolite (what Fish Man said), or maybe limestone or tuffa (tuffa is a type of limestone). Limestone buffers the water and adds calcium to it and keeps the pH high. These conditions are good for mollies and OK for clown loaches, but would be bad for some other freshwater fishes.    One kind of limestone that's good for fish tanks (again, if you're keeping fish like mollies that like hard water and high pH) has lots of holes eroded in it, so it has more surface in contact with the water. The holes also give small fishes (such as baby mollies) places to hide. This stone is variously called Holey Rock (or Texas Holey Rock), Honeycomb Stone, or Lace Rock. Many aquarium shops sell it, and some building materials dealers who sell stone, sand, gravel, and so on also have it.|`|IwvOKjfcaa	Zeolite, we have one in our fish tank :)  Good Luck!|`|AA11708471	zeolite|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Zeolite.    Your tank is too small for the clown loach. Their minimum is 100 gallons/400 liters, and they should be kept in schools.|`|xbyQAU4haa	I think it is called zeolite. Good luck on that! Are clown loaches cool? And what size tank do you have because I was thinking about getting one.|`|dnqrBIcjaa	Its called zeolite. In the confines of an aquarium, the waste produced by the fish can quickly build up to harmful levels without an effective filtration system.Daily visual checks are vital; any unexpected change in the appearance or behavior of your fish may indicate that there is a problem.      For example, if the gills of a fish become brown instead of the normal pink, it is likely that theres too much nitrite in the water. This will interfere with the ability of red blood cells to carry oxygen.    Applying zeolite technologies for livestock-fish integrated systems should improve sustainability by increasing nutrient utilization efficiencies while reducing undesirable farm outputs.     Most of the nitrogen entering a farm as animal feeds ends up as ammonia in manure, which is either volatilized creating noxious odors or leached out as nitrate. By capturing this ammonia-N before it gets either volatilized or nitrified, and using that nitrogen to promote algal productivity in ponds, the farmer not only improves the farm environment by reducing noxious odors and nitrate leaching, but recycles an otherwise lost nutrient for increased farm productivity.
6SeWCfUfaa	Sounds like a very stressed out and insecure feeling dog to me.  It's a combination of bad training/socialization and being bounced around.  But no, that's not normal for the poodle breed.<br>  <br>  The dog needs to be made to feel secure and you do that by taking charge and being a strong leader for the dog.  I know it's not YOUR dog, but if you start running the dog through it's paces in obedience, you'll see improvement.  The dog also needs exercise and a place where it can get away from everyone, including you and any other dogs you might have.<br>  <br>  How much longer is the friend going to be in the hospital?  If it's for a long time, I'd start doing some obedience training with the dog.  If it's just going to be a couple of day, do your best, but don't get too involved.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Nope, absolutely NOT.<br>  <br>  These are the traits of BAD OWNERSHIP.  This poor poodle obviously hasn't been trained.  If it suffers from separation anxiety then the dog hasn't been eased in gently to time alone from the puppy age.<br>  <br>  This poodle needs training.<br>  <br>  Poodles are very family type dogs and do not have aggressive natures - I have never heard of a poodle biting anyone.<br>  <br>  The owner of this dog needs to take some responsibility and TRAIN her dog.<br>  <br>  It is NOT the dogs fault (and has nothing to do with the breed), it is the OWNER who is at fault.|`|TRganQA4aa	From what you have descibed I think her issues come from a lack of training and socialization. Since she is dominant I am thinking she got away with a lot and wasn't reprimanded for it. My aunt and uncle had a miniature poodle that is the total opposite of your friends poodle - but he doesn't let her get away with anything and took her around people as a puppy. As a result, she is well behaved, loves people, and we even were able to take her to the nursing home (they allow it) to see my aunt several times before she passed. She loved the attention from anybody who stopped to see her - and she is not even two yet. He also has trained her to go in her crate on command and sometimes she just goes in it to lay down. Before my aunt and uncle got her I thought all small poodles were kind of neurotic but they are like any other dog, with the proper training they are a joy to have around. I adore her and I have always had big dogs because that is what I was raised with and like but if I had to get a small dog a poodle would now be on my list. <br>  <br>  So - as for getting her in the crate without touching her - throw some dog food or a treat in it and  she will likely go in there to get the dog food. When she does praise her and eventually she should go in there without the treats.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	No, they are spoiled rotten brat traits.<br>  This dog was never trained properly, nor was it ever taught that humans are dominant over dogs. <br>  I groom and know many poodles, they may act that way at home, but, never when they are with me.

In the Neolithic a number of important species (such as the goat, sheep, pig and cow) were domesticated, as part of the spread of farming which characterizes this period. The goat, sheep and pig in particular were domesticated independently in the Levant and Asia.<br>  <br>  There is early evidence of beekeeping, in the form of rock paintings, dating to 13,000 BC.<br>  <br>  Recent archaeological evidence from Cyprus indicates domestication of a type of cat by perhaps 9500 BC.[9][10][11]<br>  <br>  The earliest secure evidence of horse domestication, bit wear on horse molars at Dereivka in Ukraine, dates to around 4000BC. The unequivocal date of domestication and use as a means of transport is at the Sintashta chariot burials in the southern Urals, ca 2000 BC.

We all know that neither bologna or chips are the best choices for people either, but we like our treats.|`|h5xSfcT6aa	yeah its fine! i really wouldnt worry. they like a special treat every now and then, because they know its not an ordinary cat treat, and that you ve especially given them your food so they feel special and loved!  xxx|`|n4zSSH9jaa	one of my 3 cats eats almost anything, i have to eat chocolate in secret cause he loves it so much, so it wont hurt your cat.|`|4J2dhd4paa	Thats probly not a good idea, because when I fed my cat human food it got pancreitis.
HQPWLOg2aa	You would see problems the same day as she ate the chocolate- a month later? She's alright.<br>  <br>  But prevent any other chocolate eating episodes! It is not good for dogs. Like already mentioned- problems depend on the size of the dog and the amount of chocolate eaten. It also depends on the type of chocolate. For instance, Baker's chocolate is waay worse than milk chocolate.<br>  <br>  If your dog should get into another bag of chocolate- take her to the vet and have them give her something to vomit it up.|`|s76aC4G8aa	well a lot depends on the size of your dog, it can do a lot of harm to a Yorkie and not so much harm to an 80lb labrador.  A dog would have to eat about a pound of chocolate to get really sick, the most that could happen is that the dog gets diarrhea and starts to vomit, however, remember that chocolate "builds up" in a dogs system the more they get the more builds up to where it will eventually shut the dogs kidney's down and cause complete renal failure.  Just because something didn't happen this time doesn't mean that it's not going to eventually do any harm the more chocolate a dog gets.<br>  <br>  Don't leave chocolate lying around where your dog can get into it.|`|u6vo36vsaa	There is not a certain amount. It usually has to do with what dog it is and how healthy it is. My pup ate a bag of reses pieces and they haven't been affected by it. I was lucky because my dogs were healthy and it was only half full. I'm pretty sure it has to be quiet an amount to kiil them but depending on which dog, it may harm them.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Consider yourself (and your dog) lucky indeed!<br>  <br>  It has to do with body weight as well as tolerance. But I would certainly not test how much intake they'd need|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Here is a link to an interactive chart about the weight of your dog versus the amount & type of chocolate.

IrdZKYT3aa	Well, he should get about 1-2 feet long, ideally I'd try for a 40-50 for him as a 20 will be kind of cramped when he's full grown.  As a baby he should be just fine but they grow pretty quick.  He needs to be able to turn around comfortably and most 20 gallons wouldn't be deep enough for him to move around as he gets older.    Check out this site, a lot of the measurments are metric though, it's got a lot of good info on recoded sizes and weights as well as vulnerbility:  fishbase.mnhn.fr/Summary/SpeciesSummar...    This is some info on an ideal tank set up:      Habitat    Bichirs are nocturnal by nature, they are secretive in their habits, always hiding and they would prefer subdued lighting.  So it will be a good idea to have hiding places for them in your tanks, driftwoods or rocks will do the trick. Fine sand (gravel) are recommended altho bare tanks will just as fine for them, not to forget it's easier to maintain a gravel-less tank.    Chemical/Physical    Bichirs are hardy fishes which can withstand a wide range of water conditions altho the recommended pH for them is between 7-6.5 pH.  Ideal temperature is between 23-29 degrees C.  Weekly water change of 30% is highly recommended for the best benefit of the bichirs.    Tank set-up    Undergravel filteration is not recommended for bichirs as they are higly capable of digging up the gravel & causing havoc to the UGF.    Live plants are also not recommended altho some hobbyist has successfully kept bichirs in a tank wif plants.    A practical tank size for bichirs will be 4 times the length of your bichirs & try not to overcrowd the tank wif other bottom-dwellers or much smaller tankmates.  Although bichirs are territorial fishes, they can get along rather well wif many other fishes.  What I'll suggest is not to keep tankmates which are considered bite-size to your bichirs, unless you wan them to be your bichirs' meal.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	While you could start a baby one out in that size tank, eventually you are going to need a tank about 4ft x 2ft (floor area) for an adult.    Please dont get one unless you can house it properly.

8i90ov0Gaa	Breeding a hypo boa to a normal boa will give you approximately 50% of the babies being hypo and 50% being normal.    Breeding a hypo boa to a hypo boa will give you approximately 25% normals, 50% hypos, and 25% super hypos.    Hypo is a codominant gene, and there is no such thing as a het hypo. It's either a hypo or it isn't. Albinism is a morph which is a recessive gene, and they can carry the gene without showing it, which would make them heterozygous, or het. For a recessive gene, both parents must carry the same gene in order to produce the desired trait. In other words, both must be het for albino or actual albino in order to produce albino babies. Codominant genes only require one to make the desired trait. Say you breed a hypo to a het albino, half of the babies will be hypo and half will be normal. There will be no albinos, but the babies would be called 50% possible het.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	i'm not sure how you do that, email a breeder of snakes and they'll tell you.

Start off by adding about 10% of the new food, mix it in really well so your puppy can't pick out only the Innova.  Then you gradually add more of the Innova every day until the switch is done.      All dogs are different, the switch can be a little quicker with some.  If your puppy isn't having any problems - no diarrhea or loose stools, you can make the switch a bit faster - 10 days.|`|mH5jEhbHaa	NEVER SWITCH A DOG OR PUPPY LOVE THEM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ixFbNr4taa	Love all the ideas.  I have always fed 2 meals (7am & 6pm) for my Dachshunds.  Wanted to add only two things to what everyone else has offered so far.    1.  The night before you start your new routine.  Take up their food after the evening meal (6pm) and don't offer any other food that night.  It is more likely that they will be hungry the following morning.  This will start your new regime out on the fright footing.  Maintain their bowl of fresh water of course.      2.  With the change in the food routine -- they should also have a change in their potty habits.  so make sure to take them out a little more often.  Don't blame them for accidents -- their bowels and bladders are trying to adjust.  Be extra careful the first two weeks or so until you can establish a potty rhythm again.    3.  Consider doing some more research of dog foods.  I also fed Royal Canin.  But, I since learned that it has a lot of fillers and "bad" grains.  I use Merrick dry kibble.  Some other friends swear by Evanger's.    GOOD LUCK changing the routine.  I'm sure it will only take a few days for them to get used to it.  (But, they'll beg and plead - "we're starving" - I'm sure!!)|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Place the bowl down, allow 20 mins and then take it away...next meal time same thing.  They do and will catch on.  Then just keep the scheduled meal times and allowed eating times to break the nasty habit free feeding has created.    My feeding schedule is:  7am I feed, kiddos scarf down, and leave for work.  I get home 6pm, feed husband, feed kiddos at 7pm.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	Feed them whatever the reccomended amount is by your vet. If you are worried about them stealing each others food, try feeding them in seperate rooms or seperating them with a baby gate. You can try and add some high quality canned food to make it more tasty so they eat all of it at once, and most times it will be gone before they even get a chance to steal from one another.     I feed all 5 of my dogs in the same room, different bowls and they all gobble it up fairly.|`|2P5WRadhaa	Start feeding them separately...in separate locations if need be, but feed them at the same time. A morning feeding and an evening feeding. That's the way I do it with my 4 dogs. I put the food down, make sure they know it's there, and encourage them to eat. As soon as they finish, I take the food up and they don't get fed any more til the next feeding (except for treats for good deeds) If they don't eat right away, I take up the food anyway and don't feed them again til next feeding time. They will catch on to this very soon. I kinda stand guard while they're eating and don't let them go to the other's bowl, or switch bowls mid-meal. I've raised and housed my own dogs for over 40 years, and THIS WORKS. If you'll be consistant with them, they'll catch on in no time; and believe me, they won't miss many meals, either!    I've raised Daschunds, Min-pins, Chihuahuas, Shelties, Poms, and currently have 3 boxers and a Chihuahua, and they know the eating procedure|`|tEhJ3v99aa	Feed hem only twice a day in seperate rooms.|`|JwYwsrTzaa	You should take the amount of food they are suppose to eat and split it between two meals. Once in the morning and once in the evening. 7:30 and 5:30 is fine. That will give them enough time to digest their food before bed.    Give them about 15 to 20 minutes to finish their food. Pick the bowls up even if they are not empty. They may be hungry the rest of the day, but they will learn to finish their food when they are fed.|`|nmercOm7aa	Put the amount of food for each on their own bowl. Put the bowls in different rooms or feed them in a crate. Give them 15-20 minutes to eat and take away any uneaten food at that time. Do not give them anything else until the next meal and do the same thing for the next meal. They will learn to eat what food is there. You can eventually feed them in the same room, just stop them form eating out of the other's dish.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Your dogs are eating just a little and then leaving because they are accustomed to the food being there ALL the time.  If you want to switch them to a scheduled feeding then you are going to have to give them some "tough love."  Measure out the appropriate amount of food for one feeding and put their bowls down on opposite ends of the room.  Stand there and keep them from going to the other dog's bowl.  If they choose to walk out of the room, that's fine, let them go.  After 10-15 minutes, pick up the food until the next meal time.  It will not hurt them to miss out on a little bit of food and if you pick up the uneaten food every time after 10-15 minutes they will quickly learn that when you put the food down that is dinner time and if they don't eat they will go hungry until the next meal.  If you want, you could start with three or four meals rather than diving straight into only two meals.  And if it is too difficult to keep them out of each other's bowls, putting them in their crates might be a better option for you.  Either way, the uneaten food must always come up after 10-15 minutes.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Feed them in their crates or feed them in separate rooms.Pick up any uneaten food after 10 minutes.Soon they will learn to empty their bowls at mealtimes.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Separate the dogs during feeding, put the bowls down for 15 minutes twice a day then put them back up.   The dogs will not starve if they miss a meal or two and they will quickly learn to eat their food when it is offered.  Once they learn to eat out of their own bowls you can work on feeding them in the same area again.  If one of the dogs tries to eat the others food correct it and return it to its own bowl or remove it from the room    Edit: yes those meal times are fine|`|kBjzKyZyaa	Feed them in separate rooms at first, first thing in the morning, give them the recommended amount. let them eat away from each other so one doesn't try to eat their food plus the other ones, then later in the day (dinner time) feed them again. they might not eat all their food first thing in the morning for the first couple days until they get use to the routine, but they should get it within a week or so. just make sure you pick up any remaining food so they don't get into it through out the day.
cJPOs7Tsaa	Be real careful, here.  Feed him one cricket at a time. One is all he needs for a meal anyhow (unless he's really big). Put in the cricket, and watch him for awhile. If he's hungry, he'll go for it in just a minute or two, or he'll at least be watching the cricket intently. After eating one, you can try another.    Please be sure you have researched all the nutritional requirements of your frog. You'll likely have to dust the crickets with a calcium supplement two or three times weekly, to ensure he doesn't develop metabolic bone disease. Also, depending on the species, he may require some fattier meals once in awhile such as butter-worms.    To stop his prey from wiggling down through the bedding, you may like to try using packed soil instead. This way you can grow some plants in there, and provide him a more functional and attractive habitat. Do your research before placing any kind of plant in there with him! Tree frogs are great at trampling plants to death. and broken leaves can weep irritants. Sword plants are fantastic with tree frogs, as they resist trampling, and provide excellent cover.
znGpjsGjaa	It is not always as easy as the other person thinks, like they stated.    If the rabbit is young, under 5 months it can sometimes take a little manipulation to check for sure. If your rabbit is 6 months or older it will be fairly easy to tell. Flip it on it's back and look at it's genitals. If it is a buck(male) it will have testicles on the side of its genital area. If it doesn't then it may be a doe (female). But to know for sure press on the sides of the genital area. If a "tube" pops out it is a buck if it stays flat and looks like a "taco" it is a doe. This is also how you sex a young rabbit, as the testicles do not descend until they reach 5-6 months old.

Do water changes daily before each medication at a rate of 2-3 gallon removed per 10 gallons of water.  Your Oscar will become stressed which the number one cause of sick outbreaks such as Ick.

And some fish are carriers for ick and can spreed it to other fish every few months.  A fish can get ick more than once.  And changing the gravel now, may just stress your fish out more and you don't to want do that.|`|bqrKVBqVaa	Quick Cure -- cheap, effective, Walmart.

So actually she will be ready anytime . Watch her very closely and make sure she has a good place to have her puppies. Her eating will slack off, and her breathing will become heavier. Keep her calm and relaxed and If this is her 1st litter, be ready to help if you are needed. If she is a new mother, you may have to show her to clean the sack from the puppy and the umbilical cord. Most of the time this is natural for them but some of them do get scared. You may want to call a vet to let them know what is going on in case she needs attention from a vet during labor. Good Luck with the new puppies!|`|rmSdDT5Faa	watch her close, a friend of mines dog had her puppies under the bed all the way in the back, so if shes looking for a dark space shes ready, the breathing will become more noticeable, sadly if a pup doesnt make it she may eat it, not a pretty sight but its nature, but always be around in case she does have them, and also so she knows to remove the sack from them, otherwise if you can, do it yourself if she doesnt. how exciting!!! good luck!!

More often than not, in cold weather a cat will wander into a garage, shed, or basement to keep warm, or they sense there is prey activity in there.  One of my cats got trapped in a shed 1/2 mile away from home for almost 10 days during a horrendous snow storm.  Fortunately, he had mice and some other vermin to eat.  When I was a child, my cat had been hit by a car in February and flew off into the woods.  Two snowstorms and almost a week later we actually found her hiding -- wounded -- under an old log, so search everywhere.    I'm not going to tell you not to worry, because there are many reasons e a cat will wander off ( an ill cat will often go off to hole up), and of course, something could have happened.    But, just keep looking, put up posters, contact neighbors, the shelters, the pound.  Go out with some food and call.  Take a flashlight so you can look under buildings, cars, abandoned things (not only will a flashlight help you see, your cat's eyes will glow).    Keep up hope and keep looking, and I hope your cat comes home soon.|`|0wEDKeExaa	My male cat went to live with my sister when she moved out.

tPGxPDvBaa	No taxes but you will need to pay for vet care.  Check it to see what exactly the fee covers. Thru most shelters you only get the pet then you have to pay for neuter & shots & whatever treatment is necessary. some shelters the neuter & rabies is included so you need to check before you pick up dog so you can have a vet appt all ready to take the dog in to ensure he is healthy before bringing home.  He might need a bath & flea treatment also.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	My computer won't open up the website, but you can check the shelter for details. It may depend on whether the dog is a puppy or adult and whether it has been spayed/ neutered.    Whether you want an adult dog or puppy depends on what you want. Do you have a lot of time to commit to raising a puppy? Or would an adult dog that is already house trained and "knows the basics" be better? How much experience do you have with dogs?     Lastly, thank you for adopting and here is a book that would be good to check out: "The Adopted Dog Bible".

There would be absolutely no food value for the bird, unless you are feeding the cat garbage food like Purina that contains mostly corn. In that case you need to rethink what you are feeding both the bird and the cat.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	You cannot say the food is not harming the bird.  In fact, it probably is.  Just because you don't see any ill effects right now doesn't mean it's okay.  Cat and dog food can be very dangerous for birds but the damage is done over the long term.  Just because they don't suddenly get ill or drop dead as soon as they eat some doesn't make it okay.  There are ingredients, including bacteria, in those types of food that will not harm a cat or dog but can be deadly for your bird.  If you are allowing your bird to eat cat food, please stop immediately and keep your fingers crossed that no long term damage has been done to his liver and kidneys.  Your bird needs to be on a diet that is about 20% safflower based seed mix, along with a good brand of pellets.  He also needs veggies and other foods daily.  He cannot live long, nor healthy, on a seed only diet.  I hope this helps you make the right decision for your bird's health and for your vet bill budget.|`|LcZhQPEfaa	I don't think it will hurt him, but try keeping the rest of it away from him until you're sure. The best bet is to ask the vet.|`|AA12227599	Ewww. Cat food is made out of meat, and last I know, birds were not carnivores.|`|fOS3r4Vzaa	Parrots can and will eat meat products. If I need an emergency hand feeding formula. then I grind up cat food, mix it with warm water and you have a happy health bird. This is only when I don't have a choice, I prefer parrot hand feeding formula.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cat food will not hurt your Cockatiel... just not as his only source of protain.|`|YSYWpftVaa	my peacock eats cat food it is wild is a sub-urban area
tPGxPDvBaa	No, it causes more of a health problem by letting the dog get matted & leaving it in that condition.  I have seen dogs unable to walk properly cuz their legs were so matted they couldn't straighten them out.  Or dogs need up with huge hematomas in their ears after being matted & filthy for so long, once shaved & the dog shakes his head, he gets hematomas in each ear. Now as the dog's hair is growing back is the time your friend needs to learn how to brush & comb her dog so it doesn't happen again.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	no, just make sure he is kept warm and inside, since we are still in the cold months.    vets are not groomers..so generally that is what they do if the dog is matted. If she needs a specific breed cut, then it is best to go to a profssional groomer and explain exactly what she expects. explain it to the vet too, they may have a groomer on staff. but even with matting, the breed cut may be unrealistic until the next grooming date. long haired breeds usually need groomed every 3-6 weeks (sometimes every 6 months, pending breed) all year round.|`|lTDeZ0Obaa	No health problems, your friend needs to make sure the dog stays warm while the hair grows back. Your friend should take better care of the dog, keeping the hair brushed, so it doesn't get so matted! This is not good for the dog!|`|ydshiNrKaa	No that's really the only way you can groom a dog whose hair is so badly matted .  She will have to be kept warm if the temps outside are cold by wearing a sweater or coat until her fur grows back.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Not at all.  Your friend allowing her dog to become very matted is what's going to cause a health problem.  Mats trap dirt and moisture up against a dog's skin which can cause horrible skin infections.  If a mat gets bad enough, it can even rip the fur away from the skin...very painful and it can leave the skin raw and at increased risk for infection.  Shaving all that matted hair off allows air flow to reach the skin and significantly reduces the chance for infection.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Shaving the dog down..no it couldn't, this is the only way to deal with a severely matted coat.    However being severely matted can cause all sorts of heath issues including injuries to the skin, and severe skin infections|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	No. When the dogs are really matted like that there is rarely any other way to groom them.  The time it would take in order to dematt the dog would take hours and I'm sure the cost and pain involved for the dog would not be worth it.  To dematte the dog you have to brush it out.  When it gets to a certain point there really is no other option.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	no the matts are what are bad. they can cause alot of pain and that is what they did get rid of it. just keep the animal clean and warm till some of it grows back. you can't do this to an animal. you need to keep it brushed and clean|`|C950RXvgaa	well..  if its to cold were the dog is at they could get really cold and there blood could freeze....    also  if its to hot its a good thing  because it will help them breathe and it will also help them to run and exercise and do fun stuff easier :]|`|RKZHGqh7aa	It's not nearly as unhealthy as having your dog be all matted. As long as she keeps it warm it should be fine.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	no sometimes that's all they can do if its so matted up and if you don't shave it off it could cause them to be in allot of pain. just make sure she bushes his Hair out at least every other day so it doesn't get matted up again and when it gets to long take him back in for a hair cut|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	When the coat is matted, it will hurt the dog much more to try and comb it out and it will make the dog dislike grooming. No dog should ever be allowed to get that matted so that shaving is the only option - it's neglectful.  Your friend should keep a coat on her dog until the coat grows back out and should get into the habit of brushing daily.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	Probably not.   It does, however, depend on the breed. Perhaps some breeds, when shaved down, will need a sweater or a shirt.  But the shaving down itself shouldn't cause a problem.  The problem though, is that your friend either needs to keep the dogs coat cut down to prevent this matting from happening again or perhaps he just needs a different breed. A matted coat can cause problems for the dog as well as being quite painful for him.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	No,but the dog will need to wear a sweater when it goes out if the weather is cold.Or if it's hot,the dog could get sunburned,so keep it out of the sun.Otherwise,it is best to shave off the mats.Tell your friend to keep the dog combed!|`|A4v5B2zXaa	No it wont cause a health problem. Having very matted hair on the other hand can cause health problems. The vet did the right thing. Hopefully now your friend will keep her dog groomed. If not it can cause painful sores and ripping of the skin from the hair pulling.
3sB49YNnaa	The first thing is to know the pig getting the name so that you can pick one that suits her  looks or personality etc.    Over the years we have used the check-out counter book 3500 Names for Baby, names of characters in plays we like, Swedish names day names (long story) etc. These are merely jumping off points to be inspired by a name that fits the pig. If you dont want to use a real name, there are no end to descriptive names like Squeaky, Polka Dot and such.    The important thing is a name that fits.

snLMlBS8aa	Two headed snakes are an anomaly but very real.    Having two heads is a major hindrance to the snake, as that means adapting to synchronize movement and feeding. This is why they don't generally live very long in the wild. They're like albinos, their traits hurt their chances of surviving.    If a predator comes, both heads have to decide to escape in the same direction or else they're done for.|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	Yes, I have seen 2 of them.

bnJLKQWMaa	I own and train a Pembroke Welsh Corgi    Here are your answers:  Do they shed, yes, a lot yes  but still less than a German Shepherd.  From a good breeder (do your research, it took me 6 mths to find a breeder I was happy with) $400/$800  The breed standard is 12" high  They live a long time quite often to 15    Be prepared for a smart, very smart and very funny confident dog.  Don't be fooled by their size they are the ultimate big dog in a small dog's body.  Bold, loyal and high energy, not a couch potato, lots of running and fetching.  They are not afraid of anything.  Mine loves long distance and extreme hiking, 12 miles over hard terrain is nothing for her. I train for agility and rally obedience, she is 2 and has 95 words that she can respond to.  I have trained her in obedience in 3 languages and hand signals and teach her new tricks all the time, she loves it and is so responsive.    I have had many other dogs and Volunteer with lots of dogs and have years of experience with dogs but she continually surprises me with her attentiveness and how darn smart she is.  She has invented her own games to amuse herself if no one is playing with her.    Yes, they shed but trust me what you will be rewarded for in other very positive traits of these dogs far out way the nuisance of shedding.    Get one and enjoy!|`|ad26630d1398cb93d795e2a001eda28aaa	yes  no  yes  no|`|VF5Htmovaa	Height: Dogs 10-12 inches (25-30cm) Females- 10-12 inches (25-30cm)      Shedding: The soft, medium-length water-resistant coat is easy to groom.

Price range varies greatly by breeder - no different than any other purebred dog.   My neighbor's dogs are a bit overweight (common in corgis but should be avoided) - they are slightly over 30 lbs.  10-12 years is typical, though one of their 6 year old corgis has cancer and is in treatment.

SZOMVGBRaa	CLOWN LOACHES IN A 10 GALLON TANK ??? Can I get some of what your smoking tanya ??    Well Angel, I cant tell you about where to get them but I'm sure somebody in your country has them and is willing to ship right ?     Anyways too all your people that say you cant keep them in a 10 gallon tank IDK. I have a 10 gallon tank with just a normal 10 gallon filter with 25 % water changes and they do just fine. I have in that tank in fact 2 dwarf puffers, 6 white cloud mountain minnows and about 5 ghost shrimp and 8 - 10 rams horn snails that make baby's for food. They all do fine and my levels are all great. Needless to say my Ammonia and Nitrites are 0 and the Nitrates rarely get over 25 ppm before my weekly water change which is perfectly within range for these fish. They do product a little bit more waste then regular fish but nothing that an experienced keeper can't handle. Not to be rude to anyone but if you can't keep these fish alive in a 10 gallon then its something YOUR doing wrong, its not the fish. Here's some websites I used to learn about these guys. Make them your bible and you will do just fine.     http://www.dwarfpuffers.com/    http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Oddballs,%20...    http://badmanstropicalfish.com/profiles/...|`|hzxQMU0Caa	the ten gallon is way to small. i had 2 in a 10 gallon got so dirty then they died i wouldnt do it .|`|DqOkUgVsaa	sure i think 2 will be good..if you want to buy fish online you can go to liveaquaria.com and im not sure about australia|`|EyKJ737daa	Wow that is a small tank, about 37 litres. I wouldn't put them in there at all, definitely too small as you would need a really good filtration system as they are really messy eaters.  Have you thought about a tank of clown loaches? They have attitude and are quick too but have personality for a fish too.  Best in groups of 2 or more and readily available in Australia too.  I have a 75L tank with a bunch of mollies (and some babies) and 1 clown loach and they are all the best of friends.  I found this site too about puffer fish that you might find interesting about them.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_puffe...   Sorry but I can't seem to find if they are available within Australia anyway, sorry.  Good luck and all the best.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	According to this website- http://www.dwarfpuffers.com/ There should be five gallons per dwarf puffer.    ~Clown loaches should be in groups of at least five and their tank minimum is 100 gallons.
EyKJ737daa	Oh the poor fishy. I don't have gouramis but I have mollies and sometimes they will swim with these jerking movements you are talking about.  I actually put "Melafix" into the water for a few days and it seems to make them come good.  It's a natural remedy from fish shops that you can't accidentally OD them on, I also put a bit more salt in the water to help their "coat".  Try ringing the aquarium and see if they can help too, they may know what the behaviour means and be able to solve the problem for you easily.  Good luck with your fish, I do hope he gets better though :-(|`|T7IuHYVzaa	I had to do it once too, it worked well to fill a small container with a little water and a lot of ice.  Wait till it is very cold and then put the fish in.  I t will only take about 10 seconds or so.  Sorry about that...|`|s8QbZ0RLaa	Take a small bowl and fill it with water.  Put it in the freezer until there is a thin coating of ice.  Take it out and break the ice and stir it around a bit.  Net the fish out and put him in the bowl.  He will die within two seconds.    That is the most humane way to euthanize a fish that I have come across and I've used it before.  Sorry for your loss. :(|`|IrdZKYT3aa	I'm very sorry for your fishy, it's tough to know they're in pain and you can't fix it.  There are only two ways authorized for me to use at work.  Baking soda and freezing.   I don;t recommends baking soda, I saw it done once and it was a horrible ordeal.  The amount needed is tremendous, and it's a very slow death.  One I have used for betta's with horrible dropsy, is freezing.  Place the fish in a small plastic bag with VERY little water.  The more water used the slower the freezing, so very, very little is required.  Place them in the freezer and they can go to fishy heaven.  An even quicker way is to add some soda to the water as well, it helps to pull oxygen from the water.  Good luck : (|`|bDPVRtCNaa	The most humane way to euthanize a fish is to use clove oil.    Place your gourami in a bucket with about a gallon of water and add ten drops of the clove oil. This will put him under as in surgery. To actually euthanize him you'll need to OD him on the clove oil, so at least double the dose. When his gills cease moving he is gone.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Aww how sad..I have no idea how but I wanted to tell u I hope your fish gets better.|`|JsBb732Maa	I'm sorry about your fish. Wrap your fish in a wet paper towel, put him in a plastic bag and put the bag in the freezer. I read in a gold fish book that was the best way to put them down.|`|OaaJ7o9Haa	There are many ways to euthanize fish such as quick-freezing, beheading and flushing, but the only human way is to use clove oil. Remove your fish and put it in tank water, adding clove oil to sedate the fish. Clove oil is used to sedate fish by vets. It's difficult to overdose the clove oil, therefore it's not a sure death.     Most fish will wake upon being removed from the solution. What you need to do is add vodka to the solution after  your fish is asleep. Soon your fish will stop breathing but it is painless. Check for gill movement and if you see none within 2 minutes, your fish has been euthanized.
w1lh1INHaa	Cats in heat love everybody.  Normally viscous or wild feral cats will love you when in heat.      Take this opportunity to make good friends with her.  While this lovey-dovy attitude may end once she is out of heat and after she is spayed, if you can develop a rapport with the cat during this time, it will help her trust you more after spaying.    And, after she is spayed, she just might warm up to you period, because right now you are the usurper in her domain, and after getting fixed, she won't see you as competition for your boyfriend's affections.|`|45b08ca1dc880690ca7764657e05b376aa	They become super friendly during this time, she may even like you from now on.

qFtqdYUEaa	I have a Smooth Fox and I just love this dog !!  We've had terriers (many kinds) in the past 25 years.  Physically the Smooth is a wee bit taller (longer legs) than most JRTs not quite as stocky looking, and mussle is more pointed (I like to say elegant (smile)  Smooth are a similar disposition to a JRT - fun, busy, fast moving, curious and typical Terrier personaility,  but slightly less stubborn and wilful, and not so scrappy (IMHO)  as JRT.  But I know, all dogs are different ! even within the same breed, so I don't mean to generalize, these are just my observations.    Be aware that Smooths shed,  their coat is quite short haired (like a beagle's) but is constantly growing and thrown off.  This can be managed with  grooming with good stripping stone in the back yard -ha !    Smooths are very sturdy and generally very healthy dogs and may not have been so agressively bred as JRTs in the past few years.  So this was a plus for me when choosing.   As someone else posted, Smooths are not that easy to find.  There are very good breeders out there if you do the research you'll find them, but you may have to apply and wait for a litter.    If introducing a new terrier to a home that already has one it is usually wise to get one of the opposite gender. If introducing a puppy you will have to be careful to really supervise their time together until the puppy is big enough to defend itself.    Good luck with your ponderings,  thinking about a new or next dog is always such a fun time !

Like if there is a book on the floor that isn't normally there, she will notice it from across the room and if she has to get to the other side of the room she will run and JUMP over the book, or shoe, or roll of tape, etc. She's afraid of a lot of things.|`|GoEdpprvaa	When I look at my little kitty lying down on top of my tv, & he starts staring at me & meows the cutest little meow.

eyZhiXYpaa	Yes, the poor thing, it obviously came from a very cruel home too and will be much better off with you.<br>  <br>  Thank you for saving a life.<br>  <br>  The Vet will check the following:-<br>  <br>  Ears, Eyes, Body Check (for lumps etc.), the coat of the cat, teeth, anus - this is a general check.<br>  <br>  The Vet will then suggest that the Cat is vaccinated as he will not be able to know if this has already been done.<br>  <br>  The check should be free as long as you get the jabs done.  The jabs in the UK would be around ￡20 each.<br>  <br>  I wish there were more people out there like you my friend.|`|d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	Prices vary from hospital to hospital.  <br>  Had you investigated at the construction site if anyone knew anything about the cat?  Had you put in a found report with the local animal authorities?  <br>  He should be scanned for a microchip - I would hope that if someone put as much effort into completely declawing a cat that they'd microchip him.  The only way you would know if he's be vaccinated for rabies is to do more bloodwork (titers to check his level of protection) - he obviously cannot tell you.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Wow, good for you!!!  That's amazing of you to be willing to take that cat in and care for it.  The fact that its declawed (and on the BACK feet) means someone didn't know a thing about how to care for a cat, its so sad, and its amazing that this cat has a good attitude.  A vet visit is going to run you around 100-200 depending what shots the cat will need or any illnesses it has.  A vet tech might have some more detailed info for you, but watch this poor cat and its paws.  Declawing makes the paws very sensitive and they can have trouble using the litter.  I would look up some info on how to care for a declawed cat and the differences between that and any other cat.  Good luck to the two of you, I really wish you all the best.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	Aww - that was very sweet of you!!  Congrats on your new family member.  Yes, it would involve a blood test and they'll also check to see if he/she is spayed neutered (which it probably is because it came from someone's home).  And that is why it is cruel to declaw a cat - once again, a declawed cat got out of the house (its owners probably thought that the cat would never get out).  What a shame.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that shows you the difference between male and female cats:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peteducation.com/images/articles/kitten_gender.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.peteducation.com/images/artic...</a>
YiY9Yd2Jaa	If you invite a girl to come see your motorbike in a big barn out the back of nowhere she'll run away.  If you invite her to see your horse in a big barn out the back of nowhere, she'll run toward it.     And with a motorbike you can't say "Better take your blouse off, that colour spooks him". ;)|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Because if you 'tell' a motorcycle to do something really stupid, it will.  A horse might refuse.|`|u1HahCoqaa	You don't have to pay for gas, you never need a mechanic, and a horse doesnt pollute the atmosphere. And when a horse dies it becomes fertilizer. When a motorcycle calls it quits, it simply becomes more trash that takes a few decades/centuries to decompose.|`|Uib2Lmywaa	You can ride a horse...   Up a steep incline covered with rocks and trees   down a steep incline   Over logs in the woods   Through brush and trees   where there is no trail   With your eyes closed   Through water   Through deep water   in the snow and ice   without a helmet legally    Horses are..   Organic   Less Noisy   Green!! -environmentally    Horses reproduce.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	You can teach your horse a new trick every day. The bike is only capable of certain things.|`|V7AAba8Laa	When I was about 10, I got a horse, and my older brother got a dirt bike.      The horse never broke down, blew out a piston ring, or needed an oil change.  I could go riding anytime I felt like it, no gas money required.    The neighbors never complained about the noise with my horse, nor did she ever tear up a dirt trail that became a dusty, ugly eyesore on the property.    I never got in trouble with the local police department for riding on the road.    Horses also have a sense of self-preservation that machines don't - I never wiped out on the horse because the trail was too steep or the pathway was unstable.  Dirt bikes don't make a conscious effort to maintain steady footing, nor do they have the power to think about what dangers are.    Then there is the obvious companionship factor.  Dirt bikes certainly don't have personalities - they're not happy to see you when you arrive to take them out for a ride.    And the horse outlived the dirt bike by... about 18 years.  She made it to the ripe old age of 30.     I think my brother realized pretty quickly that, if given the choice over, he would've preferred a horse.|`|p9A61dFgaa	Because a motorbike is a cold bit of machinery, though cool and fast. You just don't feel the same power than that of a horses muscles flowing under their velvet coat. A horse is a companion with personality and will learn. They are great!!

u61yKsE3aa	Ussualy that type of mis shape and color change can be because of a vitamin deficiancy.  But it' s hard to tell with him in the water.  Do you have a uvb light and do you provide a varried diet?  These could be causes just a suggestion.  Good LUck|`|hQQuqyYcaa	It almost looks like it's pyramidding.....meaning there's too much protein in her diet.
u61yKsE3aa	You say grale like stuff what exectly does it look like.  Is it rock gravel like for a fish if so you should switch bedding.  Is it small and brown It could be wal-nut bedding and that is fine.  If you could show us yoiur bedding in a pic that would help,  I hate to say it but just because the pet store said it doesn't mean it;s right unfortunatly pet stores give out alot of false info and often they don't really know how to care for anything more that a dog or cat.  Not all are like this but a lot are.  Good luck|`|f6RCFUNwaa	a gecko|`|mSaQSSPhaa	http://www.geckocare.net/housingagecko.p...    hope this helps.|`|zMAoWihQaa	it should be fine just make sure she has no prob with it.|`|LsmS4WFSaa	maybe some tall plants, maybe a little of dirt, rocks and thats like about it.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	If she is an adult it is fine.  Only baby geckos have trouble with sand.  I would not use gravel though, it probably isn't very comfortable.
naVUguuHaa	How are the temperatures in your tank? It could be too cold or too warm for her. The tank should be 82-88 F for the day time. Does she have and UNDERTANK heater? They need one to help digest their food properly; maybe she is having trouble with that?    Also, she COULD have parasites. I would consult a herp vet.|`|ETX2tZoEaa	Huh... That's not natural for geckos... Try taking him to the vet, or maybe try to coax him into eating with a twist in his diet, like one of those little crickets they sell at pet stores.|`|pf21XfB7aa	if she is not losing any weight she is fine|`|c76c3ee25732c42579fccc8f6af2e8ffaa	A winter slowdown is pretty normal.  They also slow down their eating when it's time to shed or when the temps get a little low.  I'd get a digital thermometer to check that your temps are 88-92 in the hottest area.  Adjust heat if the temps are off, and maybe try a different feeder.  Try crickets if he doesn't want mealworms.  Definitely worth a shot.

I can't give you any advice on how to make him feel better, but if you want to try and catch the hammy... do this.    Take your cage and leave a trail of his food around the cage and leading up to it.  Make a ramp type thing so he can get back in his cage, and put food in the cage too.

cGRyDCpQaa	Crap quality. I bought one for temporary use, and it took me 40 minutes just to adjust it for the horse. The holes weren't punched all the way through and weren't big enough, the leather was so stiff I could barely move it, the buckles were super stiff, and he reins are terrible to use since they're so stiff. I left conditioner on it over night before I even attempted to use it, too.    Buy a nice quality bridle... they're worth the money.|`|JG7W0qvcaa	yes yes it is xx|`|ej9IE5Csaa	Hmmm I've used Kincade tack before. I don't personally like the brand, but it's durable and will get the job done. :D   I've found the cons to be that it's not the best leather and can wear a little faster then other bridles, but in all it depends on the deal your getting and what you intend to use it for ^-^|`|mEKsbCw2aa	Kincade leather is very cheaply made, I would look for a nicer bridle|`|Q8Sv4V48aa	Kincade Bridles are crap. You get what you pay for. I have an HDR bridle and I LOVE it.|`|rZPmo1Wzaa	it's farirly good quality tack- the leather can be stiff but if you clean it and oil it a lot it lasts pretty long. they're nice bridles but as i said many people prefer nicer leather but if it's just for trainging and not for show i guess it would be fine.
lJaxgJQcaa	i think you should take it to the vet just in case ya know|`|s1Sj3u5faa	:(
znGpjsGjaa	She will be fine. In a week she will not even remember she had kits.  it is also very hard on a rabbit to give birth and care for kits for the 8 weeks it takes to raise and wean them.  She needs to rest and build herself back up with no kits around.  Give her good feed and lots of hay. Make sure she has plenty of fresh water.    Also something to know if after 2-3 days you tried to return the kit to her she would attack it and hurt it as she would not remember it as her offspring, it would be a strange rabbit to her, invading her territory.|`|J3HKl0Hqaa	probably, try  to cheer her up with a new toy or a new treat or both|`|8GDd6lrnaa	she will be fine just give her a lot of  attention. toys when your not around.
NIPmV4uMaa	My concern is that your snake can't kill larger food items as fast as it can constrict smaller food items. This may be why the mouse bit him, because it took longer to suffocate. Other than that, it should be fine. If the mouse was truly too big, your snake wouldn't have been able to swallow it, or would have regurgitated. In the wild, snakes have to eat what they can find, which may be any size, though in captivity, you should try to feed it appropriately sized feeders, which it seems you are looking into.    About the bite. It doesn't sound bad, if it wasn't bleeding. After giving your snake a few days to digest, you can take him out and examine him. If it is bloody, swollen, red, etc, you should probably see a vet.|`|NzWt865Caa	try feeding it two small mice  they sell them at petco for $2.49 each. And about the injury if it's not bleeding or acting hurt he should be fine. Hope I helped!|`|ZhPlmL0Vaa	your snake will be fine... if the prey animal is too large for the snake they tend to kill it but not swallow it...its easier for your snake if you get 2 small mice instead of the medium one.  It is always risky feeding live prey as there is always the risk of injury...if he does get bit where the skin is broken, put some peroxide on the would with a q-tip...you might consider using frozen mice instead of live ones.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	If you can locate a pet store that sells hopper mice, this may be better for your snake right now. A feeder mouse should not be bigger than your snake's girth at it's widest margin. Hopper is just a nickname for younger and smaller mice. If you must feed live prey, hold the mouse in front of your snake with a pair of tongs by the butt or, by the tail. Then, release the mouse when your snake takes it. This will help to reduce mouse bites and you can quickly remove the mouse if it gets aggressive towards your snake because you already have a hold of it. If there was no apparent wound from your snake being bitten by his food, he should be okay.

7HEZhx46aa	Don't take it home unless it's completely weaned. Some birds, like cockatiels and budgies, wean at only a few weeks (8 sounds more reasonable than 7 and you should never rush it).  I have three caiques and two of them came to me as fully weaned babies. One was just weaned at 3 months old and the other was 6 months old, but had weaned at 3 months.    DO NOT take this bird home if it's still hand-feeding. No breeder worth their reputation would EVER let an unweaned baby be taken away.  Handfeeding is very tricky and you can seriously hurt the bird -- you have to heat the formula a little bit before giving it to the bird and you can actually scald its crop and kill it, or you can OVERfeed it and kill it by practically drowning it with food.    As long as the bird is eating fully on its own and does not need any formula, it'll be fine.|`|ded7fc19860a81607ee52a6560480ab2aa	7 weeks is young, it must be feeding itself before you get it. you do not have to feed it.give it plenty of fruits and vegetables. the bird will be fine it should not die if you take it home, as long as it is eating on his own.|`|MCmV7BOIaa	This baby is not ready..baby cockatiels don't wean until 12-13 weeks of age..this baby is way to  young and will require handfeedings 2-3 times a day for another couple of weeks.      a good breeders who raise cockatiels keep them until they are 12-13 weeks old plus an extra week or two to make sure they are completely eating on their own before going to their new home...this bird maybe nibbling at food but may not eating enough to survive.     I say find a different breeder...

Bare in mind some cats are not people cats mind wasn't, their very independent.|`|zBvKemqAaa	Hello cat owner.  I work at a humane society in Georgia.  It will take time and a lot of determination and even more patience to socialize the cat to regular human contact.  Being that he came from what sounds like a possible cat mill, he may used to dealing with other cats in great numbers but not human contact.  This is the unfortunate risk you take by purchasing any animal from an unlicensed seller.  Please do not give up on your kitty.  Make sure you are asking fellow cat owners that you trust, local shelter personnel and your vet (especially your vet) anytime you have the slightest issue/ question in regards to him.  It will eventually work out to a certain degree.  He does not hate people, he just does not fully trust humans due to his checkered past.  Cats are by nature NOT PACK ANIMALS and you will need to earn his trust and teach him he can trust you.
Wj212FWXaa	my hamster actually had babies 2 super bowl sundays ago... i didnt even know she was pregnant!! lol i tried to figure out what they were but its really impossible to do so until they are about... oh lets see i want to say like 2 weeks old or so.  if i remember correctly thats when the males started to ... develop.  honestly you just have to wait until they start puberty.  BUT AS SOON AS YOU FIGURE IT OUT YOU NEED TO SEPERATE THEM BC THEY WILL MATE WITH EACH OTHER AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE EVEN MORE BABIES TO DEAL WITH!! i know its gross, but its totally true. thats what happened when my friend bought 2 mice.... like 3 months later she had dozens of them.|`|Km6gOd61aa	Well, it's very hard to tell when they're babies.

JwYwsrTzaa	It depends on the dog breed and how much they are outside. A indoor dog should not be bathed more than once a month unless necessary. Too much bathing makes their skin dry and irritated. Outdoor dogs should be bathed at least once a month, maybe twice, depending on how dirty they get. Make sure to use a good quality shampoo for that specific breed.|`|y6p1ZAdRaa	I bathes my dog once a month becauwe I hear that the dog could become sick or get infects if bathed too often|`|tPGxPDvBaa	You should only "bathe" a dog once a month at the most.  Overbathing leads to a lot of skin & coat problems.  Only use a good pet shampoo - no human products at all.  Brushing is far better for your dog than bathing.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	That depends entirely on the breed of dog. Some need bathing often and others do not.|`|bZe2bSMdaa	They suggest you not bathe a dog more than once a month. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule. There ARE occasions he just REALLY needs a bath!|`|jXHLZS5Laa	It depends upon the breed. If she sheds a lot, give him/her a bath only once a month. If he/she doesn't shed too much, give her a bath once every two weeks.|`|RDcwT7YEaa	I bathe mine once a week.|`|97sZDDUZaa	I bathe my dog once a month but when I go camping and my dogs get really dirty I just wash them without any shampoo or anything. The breeder I got my dogs from recommened to use baby shampoo because sometimes dog shampoo is too strong for my dogs.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I give my dogs a bath every 2 weeks.  I use an all natural dog shampoo and conditioner to make sure I don't dry out their skin.|`|SNHkffbGaa	3 time a mouth and a bath no shower

yAsLhdp2aa	when was she declawed? If it has been a while, it is possible that a nail may be trying to grow back in the joint where it was amputated. It is painful and I would have her checked by a vet as soon as you can (a ER tomorrow) to avoid an infection to be put on pain control, and possibly have a surgery on that digit again.  good luck. poor thing.    If the declawing was recently done..then it is sure to be related to the procedure and she may need to be seen tonight at an ER|`|jibEAR7iaa	Check with your vet. De-clawing can cause problems if not done right, but limping can be the cause of something more serious like a ruptured anal gland or even cancer.
WQECudWkaa	Try petfinders.org  or YTCA.org or YorkshireTerrierClubNC.org.   If you are in California try www.WrenYorkieRescue@aol.com.  I adopted my yorkie from there. Very reasonably priced with tons of extras!|`|OKiMkaxGaa	An animal shelter is the only reputable place for a cheap one:  http://www.petfinder.com|`|XagPxe7Faa	I want a cheap Mercedez.  Sounds silly, but the concept is the same.  Unfortunately, you don't get things handed to you for little to nothing just because you want one without having to pay what they are worth.    Yorkies are not cheap because breeding ethically is not a cheap venture.  Breeders have costs invested in their programs--stock, whelping and grooming supplies, vet bills, medical testing, show costs--that they try to cover by the price the charge for pups they place.      If your funds are limited, your best bet is to check with a rescue organization or shelter--rehoming fees are generally less than the price of a pup from a breeder.  Otherwise, you will likely have to bite the bullet and save your funds just like everyone else.|`|qW0tq6A2aa	you're not going to find a GOOD purebred one from any breeder. any "cheap" yorkie from a breeder will most likely have health problems and mental problems that in the long run, will cost you more.    try a yorkie rescue... you can search for these online.    but any good yorkie with good conformation and mind will cost you around 800 dollars if not more... the cheapest you might be able to find will probably be about 500.... ask your breeder lots of questions though and find out how knowledgeable she is on the breed and how reputable she is...  GOOD LUCK!
ydshiNrKaa	Puppies should receive a full series of vaccines beginning at 6 to 8 weeks of age and repeated every 3 to 4 weeks until they are 16 to 20 weeks of age to protect them against all the common diseases.   Unvaccinated adult dogs should also receive two full sets of vaccines spaced 3 to 4 weeks apart. Puppies should receive immunity against some diseases through their mothers milk but this disappears during the first few months of their life. To protect puppies during this critical time, a well-researched approach is taken: A series of vaccines is given every 3 to 4 weeks until the chance of contracting an infectious disease is very low. The typical vaccine is a "combination" that protects against canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus, parainfluenza, and canine parvovirus (the four viruses are commonly abbreviated DHPP).

The ears will start poping out b4 the eyes will open.|`|zBvKemqAaa	At about 10 days (on average) kittens will open their eyes.  Remember that a all newborn kittens when their eyes first open will appear to have a blue tint in color. Their true eye color slowly emerges over a period of time.  Next, at about three weeks on average their ears will assume the upright position, making it look like a miniature version of the adult cat it will become.  Next at about 6 to 6.5 weeks, the kittens will be weened and ready to eat solid foods.|`|bfe64c1553815bdd2ea9e4f6ff28becdaa	They usually open their eyes in about 10 days.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,    Cats seem to be attracted to plastic bags. It is fairly common for cats to lick these bags, so it is best to not let cats around them without supervision. They may ingest the pieces of the bag, which could be dangerous.  Plastic bags are made from animal fat, so the scent is quite attractive to them.    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    I have a cat that goes bonkers over plastic of any kind. so we keep bags and other sheets of plastic out of his reach.    You cat is more than likely estatic around the bags, but really is not "humping" it.. she is just playing with it very lovingly.    Hope this helps, and to keep bags away from your cat.    Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Freelance writer/blogger for  http://www.petside.com|`|mbqAQAJ7aa	wow trying to hump plastic bags thats weird lol.  maybe get her a boy cat to hump lol|`|I4ydg5pTaa	Hehe, U gotta get her fixed! My cat did that too, but with a toy dog. Just get her fixed!|`|oQWl6joJaa	So this actually happened with my cat milo. he always licked plastic bags, for hours on end! I asked a vet, and she said that some plastic bags contain an ingredient called saturated animal fat. and the cats can taste it. some cats like the sound and crinkling the bag makes. and cats and dogs hump because they are trying to show dominance. she is probably showing the bag who is boss..|`|wMXAatHyaa	Some cats do that just keep them away from plastic bags I don't think theirs anything you can do.|`|j7PtOkxLaa	Uh, she's probably on heat
vfhKkiSKaa	You don't.  Leave them alone and let them get to know each other on their own terms.  If you try to force them together it will just take them longer to start getting along.    The only time you should interfere is if one of them is seriously hurting the other.|`|8uqbNrICaa	Try to introduce them slowly.    One way I've found that works is to first put the cat in a room you can close the door on (with his litter pan food and water of course) for a few days. This will let them smell each others scents. I would daily swap the bedding each is sleeping on to help get each of them used to the others scents.  Once they get used to each other through the door, use a crate big enough for the cat to be in with it's litter food and water and bring it out so they can see each other but still be separated. Keep swapping the bedding while doing this. And put it back in the closed room at night so it can be out of the crate.  Once they get used to each other you can try introducing them without the crate. If they start getting rough with each other go back to the crate for a while more.  Don't be surprised if the cat disappears for a while. (Behind anything the dog can't get to)|`|OfL7FjA0aa	if they haven't been introduced try doing it at a park or somewere your puppy doesn't feel protective, keep your kitty in a small room and always moniter the time they spend together for about a week after that try letting him out one one floor of your house if you can if you cant trust them that day try the small room thing again. some dogs and cats never get along but this helped one of my friends and it could help you.|`|1TFGS4Tbaa	A cat is A LOT tougher then you think just leave them be the cat will work it out your dog will learn respect right quick!  (all pit bulls excluded) they'll kill anything
c0b3df9e6b5632ff0bda2a96cf938465aa	Yes, it could. Was your cat near the vacuum cleaner? Those things aren't as hygienic as they're supposed to; they exhaust fine dust at their rear. If your cat followed you while you were cleaning, she might have got some dust into the eye, and that's why she's tearing now. That usually regulates itself; just consider it like you tearing when you got cold wind into an eye. But for the future, you should remove the cat from the room while cleaning up. And usually, cats are very clean animals who don't need pet odor powder. I owned two, and they didn't stink at all.|`|cff06890d4173c156cdcc883215f12bcaa	Yes, she may have irritation.  Can you rinse the eye with a saline solution (like what they make for contact wearers)?  If she is squinting, she could have an ulcer and will need immediate medical attention.|`|OfL7FjA0aa	I probably is, my cousins have a farm cat that has crazy allergies in the winter its nasty. I would give the pet odor powder a rest then try again if the allergie happens again call the vet, they would know some de odorizer that could be less harmful to your cat or they could perscribe some meds or helpful tips.|`|5d472f4bada31d035337b8856b1806e9aa	Excessive tearing in just one eye could mean a herpes infection.     If it doesn't go away soon, I'd take your cat to the vet.

However, most dogs are more playful and loyal than most cats. I say most because there are always exceptions, including my cat who THINKS she's a dog :) So, for example, if you live in a smaller apartment, a cat would be the way to go because they don't need as much space to play and are smaller. However, if you're looking for an animal you can play with or run around with outdoors, a dog is a better choice.    Pets are great, whichever you decide to get. Best of luck!

ITnQEUQTaa	My dogs get the same food from the moment of weaning to the day they die of old age - a raw diet of meat, meaty bones and organs.

rLzfhCJxaa	GOOD BRANDS AND TRICKS ARE AT THE BOTTOM. However, please read everything for your own knowledge!<br>  <br>  Tuna is not a balanced diet. It has something in it that destroys important vitamins, and fish is almost devoid of calcium and much too high in magnesium. Its very unhealthy; and I do not believe you have tried all options or all of the tricks when it comes to switching foods.<br>   Please read everything below and learn something on nutrition first!<br>  <br>  Also, IAMS is one of the worst foods on the market. Want to give me a thumbs down? Read below and read some evidence.<br>  <br>  a) look at the ingredients in IAMS. Are they appropriate for an obligate (strict) carnivore such as a cat? No. There is barely any REAL meat, just 'by-products' - aka heads, feet, intestines, organs, etc. Along with the fact that most of it is corn, wheat, soy, barley, oats and whatever that a cat cannot digest.<br>  <br>  b) IAMS is one of the many companies that got sued for including euthanized pet animals, roadkill, restaurant grease, and other disgusting things in their foods under the name of 'meat', 'meat meal', 'meat and bone meal', or 'meat by-products'. Proof? Many articles right here, an the actual court file and a video of the AAFCO President's response in the first link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mflegal.com/petfoodlawsuit" rel="nofollow">http://www.mflegal.com/petfoodlawsuit</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/012647.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalnews.com/012647.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202422055276" rel="nofollow">http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=12...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/702701/class_action_lawsuit_settlement_pet.html?cat=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  I suggest you read the court file to see what other brands got sued. Hill's Science Diet, Purina (Cat Chow, Purina Proplan, Friskies, Fancy Feast, etc), Whiskas, Meowmix, and so many more are on the list.<br>  <br>  c) Wet food is not 'McDonald's for cats'. It is the exact opposite, albeit the ingredients in most formulas are still horrible (mostly by-products).<br>  <br>  Wet food generally has less grains, which equals lower carbs. It has a higher meat content (not that it is always quality meat) and is higher in protein. All this is good.<br>  <br>  Carbs have been directly linked to obesity and diabetes by independent studies.<br>  <br>  d) Canned food also does not make teeth rot, and kibble does not make teeth clean.<br>  If you watch your cat eat kibble, it either swallows it whole or cracks it once or twice with its teeth and then swallows it. The kibble never rubs against teeth. Kibble is also very sugary (carbohydrates = sugar) and crumbs are deposited into the cats gumline where it rots and ruins teeth. I have presented you with viewable logic - just sit down a moment and watch your cat eat.<br>  <br>  Kibble has no cleaning effect; and if you talk to people who's pets have dental issues, they will tell you that they fed kibble, never canned.<br>  <br>  e) Lastly, wet food is OPTIMAL for cats. In the wild, cats eat fresh, raw meat, of which 65-75% is water. They were designed to get water from what they eat. <br>  Studies have shown that cats that eat only dry food, but drink lots of water are only half as well hydrated as a cat that only eats canned and drinks no water. and again, wet food doesn't make teeth rot. As far as I know, mice and birds are very soft, chewy and moist, not dry and crunchy.<br>  <br>  The nutritional values of a mouse are as follows:<br>  -67% water<br>  -57% protein (when you calculate DMV- dry matter values)<br>  -23% fat (DMV)<br>  -3% carbs (DMV)<br>  As you can see a mouse can properly hydrate a cat, has plenty of protein and fat to provide energy, and has no carbs to promote obesity.<br>  The chewy-ness of raw meat cleans teeth, as cats let their teeth sink in and actually rub against the raw chunks of meat.<br>  <br>  In comparison, dry food:<br>  - 10% moisture<br>  - 26 to 32% protein (also, most of this protein comes from grains and are therefore termed PLANT BASED proteins. Plant based proteins are very different from Animal based ones and cannot be used effectively by cats)<br>  - 10 to 17% fat<br>  - 20 to 65% carbs<br>  <br>  Having a properly hydrated cat can save you from Urinary Tract issues, Renal issues, Kidney problems and so many other things that occur due to dehydration- and cats on dry food are chronically dehydrated.<br>  <br>  <br>  The best diet is high protein (over 40% when DMV is caluclated), moderate in fat (over 15% DMV) and low in carbs (under 10% DMV) with lots of water. It is also important to make sure the ingredients have no grains, no by-products, and that all the meat ingredients have NAMES, like turkey or chicken.<br>  However, RAW is superior to all cans and kibbles.

She eats that now like crazy.|`|el2blDi4aa	cat food|`|3qa3BftUaa	Nearly all cats that I have had experience with always lick the jelly or gravy and leave the lumps. I look after my neighbours cat sometimes and he does the same, although he goes back and eats the dry lumps later. <br>  <br>  Cats are grazers they do not eat all their food in one go like dogs. They like to leave some and go back to it. What I do with the pouches is just put half of it out, and give the rest later, that way it does'nt all get dry and stale at once. My neighbours cat also loves tuna and when I make myself a sandwich he goes all silly and almost mugs me for it. He knows where it is in the cupboard and goes looking for it. It is the only food that he really enjoys and clears the plate everytime.I give him some as a treat now and then, but it is too salty and should'nt be given as their main food all the time. Also cat food is nutritionally balanced and they need certain things that Human food does'nt contain. Cats don't drink a lot and often suffer kidney problems so be careful with giving non cat food too often.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	It's possible he simply doesn't want to eat more. You can't feed hm just tuna - I've never met a cat that didn't love tuna by the way. If he likes IAMS kibble, feed him that, it's complete cat food. My cats eat dry cat food and do very well on it (Science diet). I think most cats prefer the food they grew up with.|`|wyAbkG3oaa	My cat is like that, she licks all the jelly off the meat, but she will eat dried cat biscuits as well. The only meat she will eat is Felix chicken cat food. They are fussy. Maybe try different brands of cat food and different flavours.|`|yCWjBrjnaa	Don't worry to much as long as he is healthy.  Maybe worth having hime checked over by the VET as he may have something wrong with his teeth & finds the meat hard too chew.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|X6PDtlq4aa	Giving your cat wet food everyday is like giving your baby a hamburger from McDonald's everyday. It's gross!! A balanced diet does depend on the age and weight of your cat. If he is a kitten then yes, wet food is ideal for awhile until they are at a healthy weight. If your cat is older, than IAMS dry food is what he should be eating on a daily basis. Wet food should be given ONCE A MONTH to promote regularity in his digestion. <br>  If he doesn't eat a lot during the transition, don't worry- a hungry cat will eat! Keep an eye on him though, it's not common but if the cat isn't eating there could be a real problem like tape worms or disease in which a vet would have to be seen. <br>  My cat is 10 years old and has never been sick or finnicky with his eating habits. I give him dry food in the bowl and change it with fresh every few days. He gets Fancy Feast Tuna flavor once a month as a treat (this flavor is the only one without wheat gluten, the ingredient that killed a bunch of animals a few years ago). Avoid any wet food that says "Feast"-- this pretty much means every hoof and horn from any animal under the sun is ground up in it. I wouldn't eat it so why should my cat! I switch up his food every once in awhile. I usually get the indoor formula from Purina, but sometimes I get the Senior formula or Dental Diet formula. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|CB15kchkaa	I really don't know I'm having the same problem and was going to ask the same question. Mine will only eat the pouches, but if she doesn't eat what I put out in one go, she will demand fresh an hour later. She wastes so much food and it's not cheap. I put out half a sahet at a time but she rarely eats that in one go, yet all in all she does eat more than 400g per day. Now she's only 9 months and I remember my previous cats years ago would eat max 1 tin per day. Hoping you get some real answers because I could do with some advice myself!|`|2UDbOpxTaa	Dry food is best for cats so keep feeding him the dry IAMS. Tuna is ok every now and then but isn't so good every day. If you're worried he's not eating enough then give him a tin of tuna perhaps twice a week but try to stick with the IAMS.<br>  Say hey to Roger for me :)
ERVB99aXaa	I have had 27 ferrets, out of all of them only 2 where calm, with both of them I was worried. The one thing I noticed is that both of them grew to be unusually large guys, one of them was the size of a small dog, they both lived very long healthy lives and I grew to love having lap ferrets. Sometimes lazy ferrets can be a sign of something bad, its not a bad idea to get him checked, its important to remember that ferrets don't show sickness or injury unless it is very severe so little signs have to be watched carefully.<br>  Cross your fingers, if you are lucky enough to have gotten a lazy ferret they can be awesome companions to chill with.|`|u6vo36vsaa	Don't worry. Ferrets are usually playful and wild but not all of them. Sometimes, their personalities are just not wild and crazy. There is nothing wrong with him, he is just naturally calm. I used to own a ferret and she was very calm and didn't act crazy or wild much. We took her to the vet and she said what i just told you. He was just born calm. Nothing to worry about.|`|bepZupAfaa	i had a ferret that was like that. he just didn't seem to go at the same speed as my other ferrets did and still do.i named him "little abner" after an old comic strip character because of his slow, laid back personality. he was 4 month old when i got him and my sister got his brother at the same time. her little guy was a wild child compared to abner. <br>  <br>  abner passed a month ago at the age of 4yrs.<br>  <br>  if this is a real concern for you i'd have him checked out by your vet. which is what i did with abner since he was not as fast paced as the other ferrets i already had. he checked out just fine. we decided that was just his personality. <br>  <br>  hope this help

AA10859773	Why is your vet suggesting this?  Does she have a specific condition that he or she thinks will be helped by eating less protein?  Or is it a case of "hey, your cat's old, it's time to cut back on the protein?"<br>  <br>  Before making any changes, you should get more detail from your vet on why they are suggesting this. <br>  <br>  Because frankly, low protein diets are almost never (or maybe never ever) appropriate for cats.  <br>  <br>  If he's suggesting this due to kidney problems or potential problems, you should know that the low protein way of thinking is based on test results performed on animals other than cats and I think they were even misinterpreted.....I won't go on about this because I'm not sure if this is even the case here.  But if it is I can dig up more info.<br>  <br>  Iams is crappy food.  The prescription foods are also crappy.  k/d is the Hills version and I'm sure Royal Canin or Eukanuba has their own version.  They're all garbage.|`|el2blDi4aa	chicken|`|TiAK1629aa	You might want to go ahead and try the prescription food.

MstjbpVJaa	The Yellow one is over preening ,the White one,or could possibly be Moulting.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Your white budgie could be molting which is normal.  Budgies usually lose their feathers (molt) twice a year.  Another possibility is mites, which you can check for by putting a white cloth over the cage at night.  If your budgie has mites, they will be on the cloth in the morning.  If that is the case, then your budgie needs to see a vet for treatment.  Mites are easily treated with medication by the vet.  Don't attempt to treat the condition on your own.  Most store bought medications aren't that strong and you can make the bird sicker by giving it the wrong amount of medication.<br>  <br>  Here is a website that has some great information on mites:<br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/mites.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/mites.html</a>
c2d91f8848c790497d198b753a8d3401aa	I wouldn't worry too much about what they thought of me.  I'd take the dogs and the puppies in to keep them warm.  Then discuss with Animal Control what needs to happen.  Obviously, these folks don't care for the dog or they wouldn't allow her to wander and have unplanned puppies.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	Just take them in for the night. If they're taking that poor care of them anyways, you can probably get them for animal cruelty to boot, and that would enable both the mother and the pups to get a better home.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	call them, if the are not answering, if not put a note quickly under there door to say that they are at your place, then quickly get back to your baby|`|HDiSjSHiaa	I would call animal services and have the poor momma picked up. No dog should have to beg at another persons house to be taken care of.     You say she has hair loss. It could be fleas, mites or demodex.    I would call for help, get her to a safe place where she and her puppies and be taken care of properly. Poor things, they probably need some serious TLC and you shouldn't be the one to do this. You don't want to get into too much bother from your neighbors.    Don't feel bad. Your neighbors obviously don't care about them one bit.|`|x9bW1bD4aa	No i would not be upset i would be thankful but unfortunately some people would in that case who cares call the authorities its abuse in every sense of the word.|`|qy73mdfHaa	It sounds like mama is ASKING you for help with her babies. They can forecast the weather better than we can. Just leave a note on their door. If it is still there in the morning, than they didn't even notice. Take the note back and be available for the poor mama the next time she needs your help.    It sounds like you have earned her trust with her most precious possessions. I'm glad she has you to go to. Is there anyway you take her permanently if they allowed it? Maybe find a way to tactfully ask them for her? Maybe even an offer of a little money?     Best of luck to you.|`|4YATkvvpaa	aw that poor dog! she probably brought her puppies to your house because she knows its a safer place for her pups to be and where they will be better taken care of and be warm.  if i were you i would definitely take them in, maybe put them in a bathroom or something because i know around this time of year a lot of places get really cold at night which could kill them!  you could probably call the police or your local shelter and let them know what is going on because your neighbors might call the police on you.  the police would be on your side because your neighbors are neglecting that poor dog and her pups.    please take them in! atleast for the night until you're able to call someone.|`|2P5WRadhaa	Sounds perfectly OK to me. When you explain what your circumstnces were and the lateness of the hour., they should thank you for looking after them!|`|PNT4iuyWaa	take them in and tell your neighbor if they don't want the dog or don't have enough time for it that they really should find a loving home for it because dogs need tons of attention its wat they long|`|RDcwT7YEaa	The dogs desperately need help. Mama is begging for it. If for some reason you don't want to bring them into your home if you have a basement, garage or an area like a unused dog house, large storage box or something a long that line put them in it with what ever type of blankets or towels you don't use, if nothing else newspapers.     Also it would really warm them if you could place a light bulb in a fixture  that is made to use out doors on above them at a safe distance.    There are many reasons she could be losing her hair. The one that comes to mind first is malnourishment from what you have pointed out about your neighbors they are probably not feeding her and with the puppies nursing it is draining her.    First thing Monday morning report your neighbors for animal abuse and see if the shelter will take them in.|`|AA10829244	My heartbreaks when I hear of neglected pets; esp. in this case, because she has pups. I, also, find it extraordinary the common sense some animals display. She had the where with all to bring her babies over to your house, and there is obvious trust between you and Ma-ma.  I'd be a little nervous about bringing the dog in your house. With her losing her hair, she obviously has a health problem, which only a vet can treat. If you have any house pets, you wouldn't want to expose them or your young daughter to whatever it is. Plus, if Ma-ma has fleas, the pups do, too. I agree with those who have suggested to call the police. If there is an animal control person available, they will dispatch you over to them. They will come and pick ma-ma and pups up and take them to the Humane Society Shelter. They will have a vet come in and do what is needed for the dogs. They may, also, try to contact the owners notifying them they have their dogs. If they [your neighbors] don't come to get the dogs within a certain period of time, they will go forward with adoptions, if it is a no kill shelter. Bless your heart. The Ma-ma dog obviously thought you were her guardian angel.|`|AA11457471	Take them in & say nothing to your neighbor unless they ask ; )|`|JsBb732Maa	It sounds like if you put her and the puppies in your garage or some where like that your neighbors probably wouldn't even notice.You might could even carry them to a shelter and have them take a while to notice and I wouldn't advertise the fact that I'd done so.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Take care of the dogs. Obviously they don't give a ****.    I would leave a note on their front door. Does the dog ever go home? Do the feed it or even have a collar on it?|`|KxjUim7yaa	I think so. They might not even notice|`|fBW54cAraa	Call the humane society or your local law enforcement.  This is animal cruelty and needs to be reported because its illegal.  Until the authorities get there, bring all the dogs into your house and lock the doors. We found two kittens outside in the cold once and it took the "owners" three days to realize they were gone (they'd have frozen to death by then).    By that time we'd already found new homes for the kittens.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Who cares what they think, you want to do what is best for the dog and puppies.  Obviously the mother dog was trying to tell you something by bring her pups over to your house so yes, take them in and make them comfortable.  Even if you put them in the basement or garage, would be better then being outside in the elements.  If you have a childs kiddie pool you could make a whelping box for mom and the pups.  That way the pups won't get lost anywhere they will stay in the box but the mom can get in and out of the pool.  Put some old blankets and towels in there for her and the pups to cuddle up in and they should be ok.  It's so nice of you to want to care for this dog and her pups.|`|lMYuPrhIaa	Look their number up in the phonebook, and call.    The pups shouldn't be outside, no, and you have the right mindset for wanting to take the pups in.    Without the consent of the owner, it could become a legal issue, if you don't handle it properly!    Good luck, and at least there are some good dog owners in this world!|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	I wouldn't be upset.. but it sounds like your neighbours are really 'interesting' so they may be.  I'd take them in and let them know the next day.  Hopefully they understand. You could say you know how cute they are and you just oculdn't resist or something like that.|`|Rr2D2POcaa	No, I would be very happy someone thought of the dog's condition and helped them. I say that you keep them for a while and then try to find homes for them if their owners refuse to take care of them so they should not be able to own these dogs.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Take the pups. The way its sounds i don't think they will even notice.|`|htWtHCIfaa	call the police and nail them for animal abuse|`|fsvGF7rcaa	If I were you and I knew it was going to be terribly cold out, and i couldn't get to them before nightfall I would do one of two things.    1- Take out an old hefty blanket and wrap the puppies in it. Make a nest type bed for the puppies and the mother. If the porch has a corner to keep the wind from them try to move them there. At least to last the night. Then in the morning go to your neighbors.     2- Take them inside. They'll be safe, and warm. In the morning go to the neighbors, and explain the situation. At the very least they should be greatfull to you for helping their dog.    It seems like either way the dog will be away from it's "owners" overnight so I think the safest way would be to keep them inside.   Whatever you do if you have to touch the puppies, make sure you pet the mother to get her sent on your hands. That way she won't smell you on her puppies. It seems like she trusts you but if she doesn't she could neglect the puppies.    Good Luck with them!|`|RFfTjnxzaa	I think you'd better take her and her puppies in. I would assume it is illegal for to do this unless you have proof that the dogs are not cared for.    So get some proof (photographs, maybe?) and take them in.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	First of all I don't think they would care if you had their dog because clearly they are neglecting their dog in  the first place and should not own it. It would be ok to keep her there with her pups because its the safest for the dog. I would consider calling animal control and having them remove the dog because they are clearly neglecting it. If they cared so much they would knock on your dog LOOKING FOR THEIR DOG. Who cares about them because clearly they should be charged for neglect.
K97esxDsaa	Buying dogs from pet stores or non-showing, -health-testing breeders financially supports and encourages irresponsible breeding, which contributes both to the poor health of dogs and to the current overpopulation problem we have right now (which is also helped by adopting shelter dogs).     Adopting from a shelter will also give you an opportunity to adopt adult dogs who have settled down and who have a distinct personality. The shelter staff will know what each dog is like and can help you pick out a dog that will match your lifestyle.    As you already mentioned, dogs from shelters are much cheaper, and will usually be spayed or neutered, vaccinated, and may also be microchipped for free.    They money you DO spend on a shelter dog will also go towards caring for the animals they take in and not to lining the pockets of an irresponsible breeder or puppy miller.    Adopting a shelter animal is a great option for most people and I would personally encourage it.|`|CysZTGWnaa	Yes  i'm going to adopt a Rottweiler german Sheperd Mix puppy those dogs are much more caring and apperciative|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Yes.

I have raised and shown purebred dogs in the past, but recently, all my dogs have been adopted through my local animal shelter, and I couldn't be happier! They have a good home, I have a lifelong friend, and it has nothing to do with cost, but rather the knowledge that I have provided for a dog that was cast off or abused, and now we both are happy! Good for you for adopting a shelter dog!|`|sIX1nhCFaa	I agree, im only 15, but it makes heaps of sence, it gives a homeless dog love, caring and a shelter, and you can make it as happy as any other dog, when i get my own dog im gonna look at the shelter.|`|XL76XolNaa	I had a dog which I got from a breeder and he was a really great dog. We had to put him down because he got sick and wouldn't eat (we didn't want him to be miserable) and then a few months later we got a new puppy (shih Tzu toy poodle) from another breeder. We get puppies from breeders because we don't want a shedding dog and they have to be hypo allergenic because of allergy reasons. Otherwise we would have adopted from a shelter.
opjYENGGaa	All dogs are good if they are given the proper care, training and socialisation. :)|`|RNqHUNgEaa	They are among my favorite breeds, but be warned they are not for everyone.    Someone once said they hated Scottish Deerhounds because they sleep 23.5 hours a day. That's not quite true, but they do sleep a lot, as in most of the day. They need large amounts of exercise, but they do no provide themselves with enough exercise. If you leave them in the yard, they will go potty, then want back in, they don't exercise themselves, so they need lots of walks and running.    They are sweet, quiet, gentle, not very playful, not very affectionate, they love you, but they would rather sleep than jump all over you with kisses. They get VERY large, they are just slightly smaller than Great Danes. Their hair is wiry, not soft and cuddly. They have short life spans around 7-9 years. They are NOT guardians, they will either ignore a burgler and sleep right through a robbery, or they will wag their tail and greet them, this is unusual among sighthounds.    They are also difficult to raise. If they get too much exercise as puppies, they may develop bone and joint problems and a painful condition called panosteitis. If they get too little exercise, they will not eat enough or develop muscles, this leads to weak adults that can develop a neck problem due to lack of muscles. So you must walk them as puppies, but not too much, and as they get older they will need more and more exercise and you will have to walk them for them to get it.     If you don't want to walk a dog every day, if you want a loving dog that shows a lot of affection, if you want a long lived dog, if you want an active dog, if you want a protection dog, or if you want a soft cuddly dog, a Deerhound is not for you.|`|71i6IjdZaa	They are great dogs, if you have enough time to take them for long walks, they are large dogs that need alot of exercise and a big property/backyard:)  xx|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hello,    Absolutely yes, they are gentle dogs.

6SeWCfUfaa	lol .. this is why I stopped showing conformation.  Too subjective for my liking.  (I own a mismark now and do things like obedience and flyball).<br>  <br>  But yes, while a dog is developing the entire dog, not just the rear end, but the ENTIRE DOG can go through awkward stages.  Really, up till a dog is about two years old.  They aren't finished growing, growth plates aren't shut, even after they've reached full height, they still have to fill out ... so the dog CAN be all over the board.  Some get lucky and stay fairly balanced looking, but certainly not all and certainly none of the pups I raised and showed to their CH did that.<br>  <br>  For back ends, walk, walk, walk.  I know that sounds funny, but the more you can get that dog out walking at a brisk trot the better that back end will maintain itself.<br>  <br>  But don't make the call on the dog until you've had at least two judges in a row pretty much tell you your dog sucks or until the dog is two.  And no, she meant vit C.  C is for immune systems but it also helps the dogs body utilize calcium better and a few other good things.|`|AA10327148	If she is soon to be a year, I would give her time to grow into herself. Give it another 8 months, and you will know her potential. Yes, just as teenage humans, there is often a gawky stage, while the body adjusts to itself.<br>  <br>  ( Also, there are judges and 'judges'..They each interpret the breed standard differently.)|`|JiCKFTuIaa	I don't think I see a thing that is uncommon in what you are describing. There are judges that I regard their opinions very highly, and then there are judges. It seems that both ends of a dog almost never grow at the same rate. Next month a judge will complain about your dogs front end -- and so it goes.<br>  There are windows of opportunity to evaluate what a pups proportions will be like as an adult. The one I find most reliable is to evaluate a pup at 8 weeks of age using the Pat Hastings Puppy Puzzle, but if you use that same puppy puzzle at say 10 weeks of age I can assure you that your results will turn out wrong.<br>  There have been a lot more than just one dog that we have 'put away for a while' over the years that turned out to be pretty good specials later on. There have been just as many tho' that we titled from the puppy classes that never did anything as a special.<br>  Sure is a fun sport that never fails to keep you guessing.|`|eDySIDPQaa	She is not fully mature,give her time, I have seen young ones be like this and come back to win it all...don't get down about it, you just had a Judge that did not like her gait it all...dogs do not mature till around 24 mos, some will fill out more at around 18 mos, but the full maturity is at the 24 mo mark, some a little later, but not much later.......and she will even more beautiful...once she gets her maturity, watch her shine, you will see the difference, meanwhile, just keep showing her and getting her set for the day you begin to take Best in Show, the day will come, and you will beam from here to the moon....<br>  <br>  She will be fine, get the exercise thing going and keep it up, it will form the muscles and she will start showing off that girlie figure sooner than you think.<br>  <br>  The Vitamin C, I give it to my dogs I have now, I always gave it to my show dogs, will improve joint formation and keep them really strong, and yes it does help with their immune system, which is great for dogs being shown all the time and around all the other dogs, will keep your baby healthy and feeling good...<br>  <br>  So, keep up the good work, slow gait her till she gets more mature, and this way, she will move the hips a little less for the Judge's to rule her out.....as she matures and you show more and she is built up, you will know when to gait her faster.<br>  <br>  good luck and keep that winning smile on your face|`|44c922fa010a9d18c4e3ddee46e3edd7aa	First of all..you are getting several opinions...(and I stress opinions)  Remember...when showing, judging is subjective...so you have to understand that the judge is going to like a certain type....and sometimes it may not be your dogs type. Also...keep notes on what judges like your dog and one that don't...then you can enter shows under the judges that like your dogs type. <br>  <br>  Secondly...YOU need to know your dog and it's strengths and weaknesses....since you are new at it..use this dog as a learning experience. Obtain lots of opinions...this helps you learn to evaluate a dog. <br>  <br>  Young dogs do go through phases....she may have had a fabulous rear at one time, but as she matures, it may look bad but then look good later....you need to wait until she is fully matured to be able to really know and she is still young.<br>  <br>  No dog is perfect.....if she ends up not having the best rear...it's not the end of the world...it doesn't mean you can't show her to her championship. What it means is that you need to know her faults....emphasis her attributes and accept her faults. When breeding...know those faults and correct them by breeding to a male that has what she needs help with. <br>  <br>  I don't know a lot about aussies to be able to give you a constructive opinion..but I think she is pretty...pretty enough to be a champion.....stay positive......you are doing great...watch her rear and see if it improves....take her out running or running up steps...try to strengthen her rear by exercise..I hear it helps!  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!! :)))))|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I think the main thing with shows is that there are lots of judges with different opinions.  The one judge didn't like your dog.  And your handling may have been off a bit that day resulting in a bad gait.<br>  <br>  Your dog has had some success since then, so I'd pay attention to how you gait the dog and figure that judge is only one opinion.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	She's probably just going through what we call the adolescent uglies!<br>  If her rear assembly has been great up to now it will probably go back to being great when she matures. I would pull her from conformation shows till she's "settled" and maybe put a herding title or obedience title on her in the waiting period. The best person to ask would be her breeder, she should know pretty much how her lines develop.<br>  If you are giving her a truly high quality food she shouldn't need supplements of any kind.<br>  Also, running up and down stairs and such MIGHT muscle her rear up, called loading, and cause that nice convergence to disappear. <br>  To strengthen a herding breeds rear you want to exercise her in a "herding" manner. In other words, jog or bicycle with her at a trot or put her in herding trials so she can strengthen the muscles in the right way.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Yes she may. She isn't fully grown yet. She may be going through the *rough* or *the ugly duckling stage* (as I call it lol)<br>  <br>  Vitamin C is used by many breeders to help promote better bone structure (as well as helping immune system).<br>  <br>  I'm one of those who use the Vitamin C purposely for that. It is debatable however about the efficiency.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	I went through a similar problem with my *****. Her rear was really good then it got weak in the "ugly" stage of her life. Now its really good. You might want to look into strength training it helped my weimaraner. Basically what i did was run her up a hill for a good 10-15 times a day, once or twice a day. She built up muscle which helped to strengthen her rear. And the best thing is she loved running up the hill so it was not like I was forcing her to pull me up the hill. Also she gets a good run around the yard, she goes ballistic and run around in circles when you  act like your chasing her. I run her till shes tired, then she comes inside for a good rest. Trust me im not working her to death its just an energetic weimaraner in a house is never a good idea. <br>  <br>  Most likely she is going through the "ugly" stage. She will grow out of it. But strength training does work.My mentor was the one who told me about it and she has been in dogs well over 50 years, she has trained shutzhund dogs, the only female to do so when she was doing it i believe. <br>  <br>  Vitamin c could work but calcium would be better.|`|AA10029366	Your dog is young enough that I think it's very likely her rear will come back together again.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't count a yearling out, especially if her rear was good just a few months ago. You know how to move her, now. Just stick with it and let her grow up.<br>  <br>  There was a question about Vitamin C helping with joints a little while back...I'll see if I can find it for you.

pSX5stBHaa	Well, your 1 yo pit is still a puppy himself, just a bigger.<br>  Have you put your 1yo through obedience training yet?<br>  If not, then a class is in order.  In fact you can take both of them to training.<br>  If you're pit is dog aggressive, then you might want to look in to private lessons.  At any rate, both dogs should have training and your investment will pay for its self down the road.<br>  Puppies need to be socialized with both humans and other dogs.  You will be surprised how life will be with a well behaved K-9.|`|u6vo36vsaa	I had the same exact problem when i got my new puppy. Our older one was jumping on her and being to rough and was extremely jealous of the puppy. You have to make sure to spend equal time with the older one too. Give the older one time to be with the puppy. If it gets too rough just move it back a few feet and say no. Sooner or later it will get the picture and grow to be calm around it until the puppy gets older.|`|BkC0XjF5aa	my dog does same things when we brought home two new puppies he got really hyper and we kept thinking he was going to hurt them because how jealous he was, but he finally got use to them and calmed down, my doy also gets mad when im petting him and someone else comes near me but the weird thing is its only guys he is fine with girls but if a guy touches you or walks to fast near you he freaks out and it does get very annoying.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Your one year old needs training: NOW<br>  <br>  Jealous behavior is one of the first signs of aggressive behavior and can turn deadly.<br>  <br>  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE seek a professional trainer before it's too late!|`|eyZhiXYpaa	They will eventually get used to each other - it will take time for things to settle i.e. it can take up to 6 months!<br>  <br>  Just make sure you are ALWAYS there with the pup when it is near the other dog (just in case it gets hurt).<br>  <br>  Get a water mister and spray your older dog in the face and state a firm NO whenever he goes to play with the pup.<br>  <br>  I would do this and stop it playing COMPLETELY until the pup is older.  Then they can start to play together and the older pup will know what he can / can't do with the young pup i.e. they young pup will be old enough to nip back when the older pup gets too much.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its not jealousy. It's dominance. Dogs don't get jealous. Supervised play between him and the younger pup and some obedience and socialization classes for them both actually. He has to learn that he cannot monopolize you and that you are your husband are the Alphas in your household.|`|n8jrLDblaa	It's not jealousy...it's dominance, and you need to stop it.<br>  <br>  How much exercise does the older dog get daily? Pit bulls need extreme amounts of exercise or that excess energy can become troublesome and destructive. Start by increasing the physical activity for the older dog.<br>  <br>  And, I would seek a trainer pronto. This older dog has lain claim to you, and it seems obvious to me that you're not keen on how to fix it. Obedience training can help you to establish your proper place.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Rayven...great minds think alike, eh? LOL|`|M69z5oNQaa	My advice is to put the older one on their back and let the younger one crawl all over you and the older dog.  This shows the older dog they do not need to be dominate.  By being on their back they learn that they are safe even when in a non dominant position, and hopefully this can stop some of the dominant behavior the older pup is having trouble with.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Ah, you have the territorial, possessive Pit problem.  I know how that feels.  And I also know what you have to do to stop it.  It is called obedience training and serious pack leadership.  These dogs will and can walk all over you and rule your house if you let them.  They are Terriers!  <br>  <br>  So, I would suggest checking into a very good trainer who is familiar with this kind of problem.  Not necessarily the breed, but the problem.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	The year old needs some serious training.  Please, these are pits you have, get the year old dog started in obedience now.  Learn how to deal with it's dominant behaviors (barking at you and your hub when you snuggle together is a dominant behavior).  Don't ignore this and think it will just get better.  It  won't.  It will get way worse if you don't get a handle on that dog now.<br>  <br>  Find a trainer that works with dogs that have behavioral problems and go get a consultation.  You'll be shocked at what that trainer will find as problems in this year old dog of yours and it's all due to you not having trained the dog properly.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	You must get your one year old pit into an obedience class pronto.  Possessiveness is *not* a good thing, especially in potentially volatile breeds like the pit.<br>  <br>  Do not take a petsmart course.  I have no doubt that there are some good trainers there, but I have never met one.  You need to find your local obedience club, or start doing a TON of research into group classes.  The group setting will be really good for your dog.  Also, the instructor must have experience with the stubborn breeds, so I would avoid people that compete with border collies, aussies, etc.  I don't know your dog, but you need to decide if you are going to go positive reinforcement, or if you are going to go the correction route.<br>  <br>  Your dog barking at you is, in my opinion, one of the rudest thing that a dog can do.  I would NEVER tolerate that in any of my dogs, and you shouldn't either!
eS8wuYRfaa	You really should empty out the tank, clean it good with a solution of 1 cup bleach for every 10 cups of water, rinse it WELL, then refill it.  Just a suggestion for all reptile owners...Keep an extra tank on hand!!  That way, if something like this happens, you will have an extra one to put them in so they don't get cold.  It would also be a good idea to get the right kind of thermometer.|`|1mYIF1uYaa	Of course, mercury is poisonous you have to clean the whole tank by putting all the water out and washing all the contents inside.    And about your turtle, see someone who knows well about turtles.. and   just to be safe as possible, wash it.|`|jnwuZ2nraa	I think the water's poisoned. I've heard before that a dumping of mercury on a bay caused pollution.|`|u61yKsE3aa	To be on the safe side you should change everything out.  Clean all fixtures thoroughly and clean the rocks in a stainer and change the water.  It is better safe than sorry and mercury can kill. which you know or you would;t have posted the question.|`|q0vKbocHaa	ya hte water is probably poisioned, I'm sorry to say you probably have to clean the tank again...

5njBYJ1oaa	Amaryllis, daffodils, ivy, iris, and tulips can be fatal when eaten.  Ingesting these plants will most likely cause an upset stomach, but it could also lead to coma and death. Caladium, dieffenbachia and philodendron will irritate your dogs throat when it eats or drinks anything. Probably   the most dangerous plants are foxglove, lily of the valley, larkspur, oleander, and hops. Best is to stay away from hops, causes the sickness malignant hyperthermia.|`|MGAmNxddaa	There are so many poisoness plants out there.I just read ,as I was sitting in my vets office yesterday,that even tomato VINES(not the tomatoes,not it's leaves) but the vines are poisoness to dogs.Along with daffodils,philodendrons,poinsettias,cast... beans..there is a whole list of indoor and outdoor plants poisoness,some fatal,to dogs.
pOgzmCn2aa	I would not reccomend a retreiver or a lab! They are very active and need lots of room, definitely not apartment dogs!    Boxers, are also very atheltic and would not thrive in apartment living.    Pitbulls and rottweilers are good for protection, however they sometimes hold a stigma and management at most properties have a strict rule against them.      A chow-chow is very loyal to their family, and a small yard and a couple of walks daily will make it a very happy camper! They do however, require a lot of grooming! They're so fluffy!    Their personalities make for proper guard dogs, however sometimes strangers that you want around, they might bark at!     http://www.akc.org/breeds/chow_chow/      You could also go down to your local animal shelter and tell them what you are looking for in a pet, they will always be happy and more than likely able to find you a perfect match! Sometimes adopting an adult dog is a lot better than purchasing a puppy!|`|Ei85kgfdaa	You need a security system and a gun. A dog is a good deterrant but shouldn't be depended upon in most situations for protection. Especially if someone serious enough to attack has a gun or knife.|`|QxxCN4pVaa	Lhasa Apso. They do well in apartment life and love being indoors and much being outdoors. i have one myself and he is very protective of me. because they are the kind of dog that only pick one person to look after. and when they or there onwer feels treaten their barking becomes deeper to sound like a big dog. they are not toy dogs! they get to be around 13-14 pounds. and they are very loving.  they dont shed! and they are THE CUTEST puppies!|`|jr9iEmuoaa	a golden retriever!  theyre so cute, big and very trainable!!  theyre good with kids too, if your planning to have any|`|VF5Htmovaa	A Berger Picard would be perfect.  The Berger Picard will do okay in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. It is not important how big the yard is, as long as the dog gets enough exercise during the day. However, the Picard always tries to stay close to its owner and family, so even if you have a big yard and give the dog the choice to pick where it wants to be, it will rather stay inside with you than alone outside. Inside the house the Picard is usually a very quiet dog, waiting for its time to go out to run, play and sniff around. If the dog is trained to stay on its own for some time during the day, it doesn't cause problems (if you have two dogs it's even easier). However, lots of people take their Picards to work with them. They lay themselves down under a table near their owner and just wait to leave again or to go for a walk.|`|mH5jEhbHaa	you should get a doberman pincher because there great at keeping you safe.And there good at listening to you.|`|T7SDK8zFaa	i think that a Lab would do great but the bad thing is it needs room to run around. maybe a Boxer.  i hope this helps!!!|`|PQv034s8aa	i you want a protector you should get a rotweiler or a pitbull. if you get them as puppies they will be super loyal and will want to protect you. they are usually referred to as bad pets because of aggressiveness but they can be sweet if you treat them the right way. they get pretty big so im sure any intruder will be frightend away by the size of your dog! good luck i hope you find a sweet nice dog|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	cocker spaniel/ poodle    some of da best dogs you can get for frienship and protection.  very active, i highly recommend them|`|c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	Well, I'm not sure what you mean by protection. Simply having a large dog will give any would-be mugger a second thought. I have golden retrievers who probably wouldn't attack an intruder, but when they hear someone at the door, they have a big dog bark, so it's up to the burglar to decide whether he'd risk it, since he doesn't know what breed is inside. However, I've heard a lot of people that love German shepherd dogs for good family dogs and also protection.|`|OuI5eFcmaa	Get a dog for companionship not protection. I understand wanting a bigger dog as a deterant to people, but don't actually train him to be protective a.k.a. agressive. Get a dog for love, loyalty and cuddles.|`|u0jamFpFaa	For The Lady that said Golden Retriever, Heck No!  I have one and it is not a good protector. My Dachshund is the better one!  Anyway, I think you should get a Doberman Pinscher. One look  at them would make anybody think twice before entering your home. if trained properly when young, they can be very loyal and gaurding. I plan to get one when I get older.|`|QeohvfRRaa	Portuguese water dogs are great companions and very fun and playful.  Labs always make good pets because they're easy to train and are loving and friendly.|`|qIChGhooaa	Labs and Golden Retrievers are great dogs. They are loving, playful dogs. I own 2 lab puppy's and a lab mix and they are the all round best dogs. Pit Bulls stereotypes are very misleading. I have met pit bulls that have been just as loving and caring as labs. I suggest you go to your local animal shelter and check out the dogs there.   Good luck with your search!  :)
PT8LZG44aa	If you put it by the fridge it will not get cold, the fridge scuks warm air out of the fridge and pumps it into the room, check the back of your fridge, it should be warm. <br>  Id vote for the fridge|`|Um8osMNuaa	l'd put it in the kitchen, the fridge isn't going to make her cold, plus the cover over the top will stop any draughts. lt's better somewhere quiet, then on a night when she wants to sleep no one is going to disturb her, in the living room there will be too much activity, people talking, the TV.<br>  l have my pups crate in the hall, at the bottom of the steps, nice and quiet so he can sleep without being disturbed.|`|9kTejB0uaa	I put my puppy's crate in the corner of the living room during the day, and by my bed at night (where she still sleeps).  The place in the living room was away from the window and alongside the fire.  Anywhere away from drafts is good - depending on what spaces you have available.  I think somewhere out of the direct 'thoroughfare' is best.  And yes, cover three sides and top (I use an old sheet)|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I like having the crate in a quiet area of the room you are in the most.  That way the dog won't feel isolated but is away from most of the activity.  When crate training my puppies at night, there is a crate in my room with me.|`|J5C3WKxfaa	i keep mine away from drafty windows, vents or cold rooms, mine are crated in the living room, they use it as a bed during the day when they are out and they are crated at night|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Where do you want her to sleep at night as an adult?<br>  <br>  THAT'S where you want the crate to be.|`|aZi6BvBraa	If she uses it as a basket, put it in the living room.<br>  If you choose to put it in the kitchen, dont worry about her being cold because of the fridge, the fridge isnt cold on the outside, only the inside.

There does seem to be something wrong here and only a vet can help you. Good luck, I hope that the puppy is ok.    Now, please have your dog spayed.|`|AA11457471	Why aren't you letting the mama dog do that? A 6 day old pup needs to be with his mom! Put him back & let her do her job!

Ei85kgfdaa	Its called a dew claw and if its catching then it needs to be clipped and filed more frequently until it is no longer a problem.|`|JsBb732Maa	If you mean the dew claw ask your vet if it's OK to have it removed. Keep it cut short and a five year old dog isn't that old.If the vet thought it's safe I'd have it removed.|`|ydshiNrKaa	You can still have the dew claws removed especially if he is ripping them that frequently.  It would be much easier on him to have them removed once and for all instead of constantly having the pain he is experiencing every few weeks.|`|bicAgoycaa	The doo claw needs to be trimmed too. I don't know where you get that the dog's too old to have it taken off? They can do that at the vet until the dog is a couple years older than that. If you don't trim that claw it can actually curl around and into their legs causing infection. They typically don't "take it off" they cut it down very short. They can do that to all claws, not just the doo claw. Most breeders/show dogs owners do that to their dog. It's called "cutting the quick" But it's very painful unless you have a vet do it while the dog is under with the aide of anesthetics.    Dogs need their nails taken care of. It's not like in the wild where they naturally get their nails filed down.|`|vOnzG05Qaa	You just need to get them trimmed on a regular basis. My dog goes every 6 months or so to the puppy beauty parlour & gets washed, brushed, ears cleaned & claws (including dew claws) trimmed. Or you could ask the vet to show you how to do it yourself. You just have to be very careful not to cut them to short or they can bleed.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	If he is hurting himself on his dewclaw that often then it may be well worth removing it.  Dewclaw injuries are very painful and if he's injuring it that frequently then it is only a matter of time until one of those injuries result in an infection.  He's too old to just snip it off the way it would be done as a pup.  But he is not too old to have it surgically removed and honestly that sounds like it may be your best option.  The surgery will probably hurt a little bit, but after it heals he will never be in pain from catching it on things ever again.  I'd say a week or so of slight pain is better than another 10 years of painful injuries twice a month.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	Take him to the vet. I'm assuming you mean the dewclaw (the one that's roughly an inch or so above the other nails on the inside of the leg). These are usually supposed to be removed shortly after birth, but since it's not, you can have your vet remove it now, or he can suggest other options.
jWmnSXlLaa	Maybe hes not hungry. When he is hungry enough he will eat.|`|JsBb732Maa	If he doesn't appear sick, just picky, leave the food put for 20 minutes and what's not eaten pick it up, then offer again at the night feeding. Just do that and when he's hungry he'll eat. A healthy dog will not starve themselves to death. Pick one food and stay with it, don't give in to the picky eating.|`|QxxCN4pVaa	i would bring him to the vet...just in case.|`|UUx74K5Caa	The age of your dog would be nice to know.      When dogs won't eat, that's usually a sign they are sick. But it may just be an upset stomach. Fry up some ground meat (no seasoning, very bland), drain the grease and mix this with white rice, about a 50/50 mixture.  If he won't eat that, take him to the vet as soon as you can.|`|Mkl0bBmbaa	Hope its not nutro lamb and rice . if it is you need to change it here is why read this site . If you feed Nutro   http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/nutr...|`|18uFvmFDaa	Sometimes when my dog doesn't eat I pick up a piece and give him a command like "sit" when he does I give him the kibble. I do this about 3 times and the last time instead of giving him the food i put it in his bowel. He usually goes right for it!    If your dog's still not eating trying feeding him through a kibble ball. Fill a kong ball with his food, plug up the hole with some Peanut butter or spray cheese. Presto! A new fun way to eat!    And if THAT doesn't work. put out the bowel/ kibble ball for 20 minutes and if he doesn't do anything after that take it away and offer it again. Eventually he has to get hungry!     Hope this helped!|`|33lCc8mhaa	How long has he been off his feed?  If this is something very recent and it happened very abruptly then I would recommend you take him to a vet . A dog SUDDENLY going off his food is most always a sign of illness. DO NOT feed him cooked meat to help his stomach as cooking meat would only make it worse. Yogurt will help.     If he has gradually been eating less and less then he i in all likely-hood just getting fussy. Let him miss a meal or 2. It is actually good for a dogs digestive tract to go with-out food for a day or 2 every few weeks any way. If missing a couple of meals does nothing for his appetite then he definatly needs to go see a vet . Your little guy is just the right age for several infectious diseases so I hope he has had his vaccinations|`|Wv8YDmRHaa	Have you been trying to walk him? Are you getting outside and playing with him? Puppies and dogs have to walk and play a lot! How much are you feeding him and how often? Has he injested something? When was the last time he went poop? How long has he not been eating? Is he still drinking?
2CbfO4jWaa	hahahahahah! you have been given so much bad info! all monitors are like fish, they are HANDS OFF captives. your only supposed to "handle" your bosc when you NEED to. not when you WANT to. and here is a little tip...... a bosc that seems to like handling , is cold and half dead. if you want something to handle get a leopard gecko or a bearded dragon. and yes i gave you all thumbs down for being wrong!hahahahahahah!!!!!|`|ltIuUBXNaa	Since you haven't touched him 3 weeks it's more than enough time to adjust, start picking him up today. Few minutes at a time or until he gets cold. You will need to handle him daily so that he stays "tame". Good luck with him.|`|wd5zHEq7aa	Handle him as soon as you can, but only for short periods. I also find they adjust if they get use to you being near them without handling them. Putting your hand in and let him taste you and move away. The longer you leave it the worse it will get as his fear will grow. I got 1 8 month ago and he wouldn't tolerate me now he is very friendly and does no attempts to bite or hiss, takes time though.Good luck|`|RkK673VHaa	i would start handling for short periods of time see how it reacts, then just build it up from there,
bnJLKQWMaa	I would be careful expecting such a young pup to pull when his bones are still developing.  If you get him used to and excited about the harness, the rest will fall into place.  Lots of positive reinforcement will really help.    He will love having a 'job' when he is older and it is a great way to drain energy.  While he is so young it is a great time to start with the obedience training so he is used to your commands and telling him what to do.    If you live in an area where there is snow, check out dog ski-joring where a dog pulls someone on cross country skis, they are ski-ing along and the dog helps them go faster, same kind of pulling just on snow.    Your dog has an unfortunate reputation to overcome, but with your help and training you can make him a star.  Start working on his Canine Good Citizen and this will help you and him for any nasty comments that others may say about him and his breed.  I love them and would like to see them viewed in a better light.    Best wishes|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Take it S.L.O.W.  Very few dogs can handle pulling an actual rig the first time you put them in a harness.  Keep your dog on a leash while you are introducing him to things going on behind him.  And start with something simple, like an empty milk jug for example.  Take one step and reward him with a super-yummy treat.  When he is comfortable doing this, take two steps and reward.  Then three.  Then four.  On the first day of training you might not even get past one or two steps.  That's ok.  Wait until he is completely comfortable  with something behind him before adding any steps.  When he is happy to walk a short distance (around your yard maybe, or one block down the sidewalk) with the empty milk jug, you can add sand, water, or small rocks and start back at square one...one step then reward...and work your way back up to short walks.  When he is comfortable pulling a few milk jugs with weights then you can start over again at square one (one step then reward) with the empty sledge or cart.    Moving too quickly when introducing equipment is a common mistake that new trainers make and it can literally ruin a dog for life if you aren't careful about it.  You need to make that strange thing behind him equal fabulous treats in his little puppy brain rather than a scary monster that's chasing him.  When I was introducing my first dog to carting I would just pull the empty wagon behind us on our daily walk and feed her lots of treats.  Not real close, just holding on to the end of the handle and letting my arm drag behind me as we walked.  As the sound became just another part of our daily walk and she ignored it I reduced the amount of treats little by little.  I also started holding the handle closer to the wagon so that it was closer behind her as we walked.  By the time I actually hooked her up to the wagon she was so used to that noise following her that she didn't even notice it.  My second dog took to the wagon easily because my husband would often bring him along while I was working the older dog.  It was just part of his life from the beginning of his coming to live with us and he accepted it as such.  He also saw that the other dog was never afraid of it and quite happy to pull it and that helped too I'm sure.    Also, keep in mind that your dog is still very young.  At 6 months most dogs are ready to be introduced to the harness but that's about it.  For any kind of draft work (weight pull, carting, etc) your dog REALLY needs a firm foundation in basic obedience.  A dog that doesn't respond to basic obedience commands is a real danger to both himself and others when hooked to a rig carrying weight!  He certainly won't be ready to pull anything other than an empty rig until after he is at least a year and a half old.  Asking him to pull weight before then is just asking for skeletal problems.  And when you do start adding weight, do it very slowly to build up his muscles without hurting him.|`|0NUj2CNXaa	well, maybe you should wait untill he's a little older :)|`|FdcWPp48aa	Need to back up and just use the harness, and use lots of positive training.  Then maybe tie something light on the end of the harness that won't cause much noise or attention.  He thinks he is being chased by these object and that is scary!|`|MGAmNxddaa	Exactly WHAT are you training him for?|`|ydshiNrKaa	I saw something like this on The Dog Whisperer but I can't remember how he got the dog use to the cart.  I think he put more weight in the cart so it wouldn't make so much noise as it rolled behind the dog.  The more weight in the cart the less noise it will make.  Maybe putting some cinder blocks in the cart to keep it weighted might help with the noise.  If he starts to freak out, stop him where he is and calm him down, don't let him move around if possible until he is calmer.   I think this is just a matter of patience and keeping at it until he is use to the cart.  Let him pull things around for a short period of time then take the cart off of him, play with him, then do it again with the cart increasing the time.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	First off, he's way too young to even begin thinking about weight pulling with. You should wait until at least a year to begin acclimating him to everything, and then you should only start with the harness.  Here's a good site to get you started, just flick through it and you should find some good info on it.    http://www.pitbulllovers.com/training-ar...|`|SWuawbU7aa	I had a pit that done this to, try getting a small wagon. but first make sure your pit is use to the harness. after he is hook him to the wagon but keep him on a leash and just walk with him until he gets use to it. try walking him attached to the wagon somewhere on a flat area.  then slowly start adding weight to the wagon.  it might take some time but good luck
Ei85kgfdaa	His new owner should be happy to help you out with that.    How come his sire and dam have no titles and no health testing?    I wouldn't buy a puppy from you.    That is interesting because I checked and there are no OFA records. I also don't know why you are claiming to puppy buyers that your dogs meet the standard when you don't prove your dogs!     quote from your website:  "however, their conformation and temperament match AKC standards."|`|f4c5f36a540069fbe952ea342c721c74aa	Hoodie Maximum Overdrive Wesbar    Kassie Bonnie-Bell Wesbar|`|EfaQpsd5aa	this is random but he looks like a...  -Duke!  -Nascar (my doggy who died)  -Nike|`|pZSynuNfaa	Ace, Missy, or Cookie|`|JxLd7EIxaa	for him bolt cause in the movie for the movie bolt the dog bolt always stand like that  and for the sister what about aqua|`|j981yGvDaa	i recon Mars or jet|`|7pZOVkMoaa	Me: Ice cream sundae :] It made me think of a chocolate and vanilla ice cream  Guy on my right: Zit  Guy on my left: Left dog: Ripple Right dog: Tsnuami|`|8sk6PPj3aa	dakota !|`|KxjUim7yaa	Wesbar Brite Magic Worker  Wesbar Golden Waterlily   Corgi?|`|VxKH7KHmaa	(kennel name) Magic Moves  (kennel name) Howd he do that  (kennel name) Abra Kadabra  (kennel name) Escape artist  (kennel name) Mischievious Man    Female  (kennel name) Splashing ewe  (kennel name) Bring on the rain  (kennel name) River dance  (kennel name) Super Soaker  (kennel name) Slip n Slide  (kennel name) Roundin' up waves  (kennel name) By the Bay.

1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	only if it gets too cold in their enclosure- but it should be in a wave length they cannot see. It is good for lizards to have natural 12 hr light/night cycles.|`|u61yKsE3aa	What do they look like and I might be able to help you remeber what they are called.  Either way they don't neccesarily need a light at night but they do need to be kept warm.  How warm depends on the kind but for any lizard I would not let the temp drop more than 70 it will need to be more for some kinds.  It sounds like a anole then.  If it's an anole you need a UVB light and a basking light during the day and you need to make sure that the tank doesn't drop bellow 70 at night.  YOu also will want a lot of humidity 70-80 percent these are really tropical lizards.
lhOd2hvXaa	Absolutely!  You may find that Sophie still tries to get into her old crate now and again (old habits die hard) but it should not cause a problem overall, the dogs will quickly adapt to a new routine.    Good on ya for taking in a dog in need!|`|KYC0pmH6aa	Yes, but they MAY be territorial. The only POSSIBLE problem is their smells. Give both crates a REALLY good cleaning to make them "brand new"|`|VDy99i3oaa	I agree with the first responder and just wanted to add to it. After cleaning the crates, put blankets or something that the dogs have laid on in the new crates. This will help them become accustomed to the new crates quicker because not only will you have gotten rid of the other dogs smell you'll have replaced it with their own smell, so they'll accept the crate as theirs and this will prevent and territorial issues from coming up.  But yeah, if you do switch the crates, leave them that way after that. Switch back and forth will cause confusion and possible problems.
d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	They should be seen by a doctor.  Having loose stools too long can lead to dehydration & other problems.  The vet can test a fecal sample to see what intestinal parasites they definitely have & deworm them appropriately.  Medications and bland diets can be prescribed to help with the diarrhea.|`|t3A9qpQIaa	You should always let the vet worm young puppies.|`|rApLHbmWaa	You may want to ask your vet if there is a wormer for tape worms that you can use for young puppies and find out how long you have to wait to worm it again.  Also at some pharmacies they carry vet products at a much lower price than the vet.|`|AA11290535	I'd take them to the vet to be on the safe side.|`|o2ekfo8Faa	Keep up with the medication as directed. The worms in the stool means it's working, and there's a few less worms in them. Don't worry about it too much, but if you're seriously concerned, the best thing to do is talk to your vet about it.|`|AA11331047	You can't see hookworms or roundworms in poop. You have tapeworms. Get Cestex from your vet.
2qVcpkF3aa	I would let the vets do their job. They know best!! If there's improvements them don't put him down. I would wait until the morning to see what they have to say. I understand what you are going through and just be patient. The vet will let you know if anything was to happen. Just keep the puppy in your prayers and I think he will pull through. I would also get the little girl checked too. I would tell the breeder that you got them from to take the remaining puppies to the vets and make damn sure that the others don't have the pneumonia and they are fine. In the mean time, take it easy. I hope everything goes very well.
