Burger King used to be my favorite but they have gone downhill and lost their cachet.|`|YTQGKzuqaa	McDonald's is my favourite :)|`|AA11518036	Wendy's.|`|AA11091315	Wendy's|`|29iRZqkdaa	All 3|`|H7HZXTaWaa	Burger King - if I want fries and a burger<br>  Wendy's - if I want chicken or a salad<br>  Mcdonalds - SUX|`|CLm2dX1faa	McDonalds for Fries<br>  <br>  Wendy's for Cheeseburgers <br>  <br>  Burger King for the Whopper or onion rings|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Bk for the fries<br>  Wendy's - frosty<br>  Mcd - just random junk because there are so many mcd's everywhere|`|pueeMH6gaa	It depends upon whether you want painful cramps, projectile vomiting, or uncontrollable diarrhea.|`|MfxQv0k8aa	wendy's.(:|`|VCa9zIqwaa	me my favorite is Mcdonald's|`|qnq5ex89aa	wendys|`|ODvnyAdlaa	burger king for fries and mc donalds for burgers xx|`|AA12152076	I love them all.  I eat at McDonalds a lot more than the other two since it's near my house, so I crave the other two more (especially BK), probably not a fair comparison for me in this state of mind.  Historically I liked Wendy's more but it's not easy to get refills there.  BK is worst for health, but probably best for taste (life always works out that way).|`|ebI6ubrgaa	Depends on what you want to eat. If you're looking for the best milkshake type thing then you have to go to Wendy's they also have the best fries. Go to Mc Donald's only if you are desperate an Burger King has the best breakfast. I like their hashbrowns.|`|eawDlYHnaa	McDonald's- breakfast biscuits and hash browns, fries, and bbq sauce<br>  Burger King- chicken fries, cheeseburgers<br>  Wendy's- Spicy chicken wrap, ranch dressing, frosty|`|K9ersRYQaa	Its all about what ur feeling at the time man.<br>  <br>  Im not gonna lie though im a fast food junky and ive had all three in one day.

hsZnjZvoaa	Depending on what you get anywhere from 9-15 is what I've found.|`|E5zzDwoBaa	ya, it depends what you get. usually i spend $15 on myself|`|3814d88099ed972daa2b679c190781daaa	$10 should bet u virtually any item on the menu.... i suggest the chicken tender wrap for $7.99.  you will absolutely love it! and as far as wing sauce, sweet bbq is my favorite.  and be careful about flirting with ur waitress though, mine ended up being 16 years old and the relationship was horrible!!|`|JxY5WXF2aa	I would say anywhere between 10-20 dollars depending on what you order. The cheesy potato wedges or buffalo chips are really good by the way.|`|98177235bbb3f9cb75f1c2bc34c3c0f3aa	It's pretty good stuff but a little overpriced for what you get.  For your average burger/ fries/ pop you'll be flipping around $10-13.|`|TAQunzvgaa	Depends what you get and where you live... Im from Wisconsin and i get 8 piece boneless with a side of wedges. This usally runs about $12.00
PxJXJKCpaa	You already asked this in food and drink.  Didn't we give you enough answers?|`|gaXUIduMaa	He "should" wait until the end of the main course and as already asked if anyone wants dessert.  I have seen this occur and believe the waiter is near the end of his shift.  I usually don't say anything but do not even touch the check until I am done and then cut down on the tip.  <br>  I do want to point out that Chili's is the type of restaurant that does not hire highly experienced servers.  They do not pay that much nor does the staff tend to stick around very long.   I would not call their staff professional.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not at all.  First of all, they have no idea if you're going to want dessert or coffee or another drink (if youre having alcohol), so they never want to do this and then have to take the bill back and change it.  Secondly, its very rude, as it would make me feel as if they're trying to rush me out.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	At the restaurant I work at we are told on weekday lunches to drop the check off shortly after the meal is served. That is because many people are on a lunch break and in a bit of a rush. I don't usually follow this rule as I don't want to rush people and kill my chance of selling coffe and/or dessert or adding anything else to the tab. I do however drop the check off right away if the person is saying how they need to be somewhere or are in a hurry.|`|AA11587867	That's pretty offensive.  It's kind of like the waiter or waitresses hint that they're trying to move you through and get more people in.  I really can't find any excuse to as why they would do that.  It's plain rude.  I've had that done at one place before and we weren't even done with our main course.  It was quite busy and we could only assume they were trying to rotate people through, I guess they thought the more turnover on the tables, the more money they got I suppose.  That's just plain rude, especially at a place like Chili's.  They're always trying to push you for dessert, that's more money for them!!!  I would complain about it to the manager if you can...call them up and complain.  That's pretty rude.|`|k8HpMaHxaa	As a server, I would never bring the check out with an entree, unless it was requested. Its rude, and very unprofessional.|`|CFmE3W1eaa	Call the manager let them know.|`|DMVZra9Faa	hell no thats offensive.
8XqD6xSCaa	if you google hells kitchen "forum" you should be able to come up with something :)|`|eeb6a3893d78b8e60865b05a0ac0433caa	at my house.
SQGChL2waa	If you tip well - that's all there is to it. If this happened before you left a tip then just ask her to go out for a drink after work. Either way your a winner - she either knows your a good tipper or likes you for you...|`|5RXxXg5uaa	ha...she's just trying to get a good tip..lol<br>  can't believe guys actually fall for that trap.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Its most likely her trying to flirt a little to make you want to tip.  Happens to me a lot if I go out to eat alone.  The waitresses almost always call me hun or sweetie, tries to be super sweet, gives great service, fills up my drink, etc.  Its generally just them trying to earn a good tip, but makes ya feel good and smile at the same time.  Hey, as long as they're giving me excellent service, I'm happy to tip very well.|`|Kdph0XLXaa	That winking crap is all about being cute so you'll leave her more money. She might even think you're cute, too, but I wouldn't go so far as to say she's into you. It's all about the dough.
IIJeZ8x1aa	Javanaut<br>  Eljays<br>  Coffee Girls<br>  Mildreds<br>  Homer's<br>  ...and many more.  Most independent coffee shops have good wifi.  To get a full list (and map), check out <a href="http://kcperky.com/coffee-map/" rel="nofollow">http://kcperky.com/coffee-map/</a>|`|LYPYewyZaa	i would say library or McDonald's... <br>  <br>  you don't need coffee just study.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	A library?  Possibly the one on campus?<br>  <br>  And, It's interesting that you don't like the coffee at Border's, yet you like the coffee at Starbuck's, when it's all the same stuff.  Starbucks owns Seattle's Best (which is the café at Borders) and the coffee is all the same.  Note the initials.  BTW, their wifi isn't free, either.<br>  <br>  And, ummmm...ever consider working AT HOME?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Home, lol.

x890QKg3aa	I LOVE cracker barrel.. I don't know where your from but in Texas they are the nice and definitely not discriminative towards non-white. I'm hispanic and have never felt anything other that sweet ol'southern hospitality. As for the food.. I would go for breakfast.. they have a huge menu and the pancakes with salted pork is delish!!! Being the first time I would go for the sampler.. a lil bit of everything! Hope you make it you wont regret it.|`|SC7bXQhLaa	there's nothing spacial about it..It has everything that your grandma can make..except she makes it better.|`|0lv21TuFaa	its A-mazing!!!!|`|oqiWY1QBaa	well, if you live in wb, pa, where im from, they suck. >_< they give you crappy service and the food is nasty & makes you sick. they are clean though. i have never seen them discriminate though. in frackville, everything is wonderful. i guess it would depend which one you go to.
AA11026695	I don't believe they expire. To be sure just contact your local Papa Johns, generally this type of gift cards last until the dollar amount has run out.|`|ey3OrWlOaa	gift cards do not expire

If you really want to know then you can work at KFC and find out.  You still couldn't use it for cooking in your own home but at least you'd know.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Maltodextrinorhybdimanicynidesucralose. By "eleven herbs and spices," they really mean "eleven-syllable ingredients."    But seriously, the flavor is fake. I love the fast-food commercials which invariably show a disembodied hand with a knife, carefully chopping fresh juicy tomatoes, dicing onions, sauteeing fresh herbs. Then you take a peak in the actual kitchen of one of these restaurants and someone's squeezing sour cream out of a caulking gun.    Don't eat it. It's junk. It will make you fat and unhealthy and unhappy.
oqiWY1QBaa	idk, but you can make it. its yummier and cheaper ;3 the recipe is online.
SQxiGhz5aa	Welcome to the world of "Recession".  Beef is expensive...burgers at fast food chains are cheap.  If the business is to "stay in business" changes must be made.  It is a sign of the times my friends.  All of us business owners are doing what is necessary to survive.|`|22a6171dbf228d985a61502855bebebfaa	Maybe you're paying more, that's called inflation. On the other hand, no chain is substituting smaller burgers. |`|AA11113418	I totally agree!  Sonic Drive In  is my pet peeve.  The beef on Sonic's burger has just totally gone bye bye.  I got a regular burger the other day and it was practically lettuce, cheese and buns.  The meat was thinner than a cold slice.  I don't like veggie burgers.   They've been raising their price like every 6 mths almost.  In the past 2 years that burger has gone from like a 1.79 to 2.69 and the beef is definitely getting smaller.|`|QnKRtA8vaa	Go to a local restaurant that serves burgers. Fast food restaurants are just plain gross. Yuck.|`|7tNv9T3oaa	Go to Wendy's. There's the beef.|`|2iFQerjraa	 Go to Unos , They have a real good burger that will fill you up.<br>  Thats only my opnion. |`|ZEGuVTUlaa	I hear you. <br>  The “That’s what a hamburger’s all about” place seems to be getting smaller and smaller. Now the Double-Double is a necessity, not a luxury.<br>  
ycdkngxlaa	No i don't think so, i think they are just trying out pasta recipes to put on the menu too if they take off and people actually buy them. They should still have the normal menu too i'd think. Have fun tomorrow.|`|AA11719145	It's not now called Pasta Hut. It is still called Pizza Hut.|`|AA12145457	 i went the other day and they had both.|`|6SGBygQDaa	sells both|`|BjIueHnFaa	The whole "Pasta Hut" thing is only a gimmick in the UK, so it is still Pizza Hut, but does sell a wider range of pasta than before.<br>  <br>  I've heard it really is called Pasta Hut in the US though|`|IXsNw4Nhaa	No, it's still Pizza Hut, but they sell pasta now aswel.<br>  The advert wasn't serious lol, they were just trying to get the point accross, that they do pasta too :))|`|7dEukXIQaa	It is called the same name "Pizza Hut". It now has pasta there but that would not change the name. They are known for there pizza not there pasta. It's an exelent place to eat.|`|CruRcdkjaa	They still have pizza, they just changed the name even though their pasta is cardboard.|`|lJ4V9SsNaa	wow...not the brightest crayon in the box now are we o_o<br>  anyhoo they sell both. its still called pizza hut...not pasta hut. it just has pasta too..|`|IDQVXU7Laa	Ain't that just like a chinese selling chicken vindaloo??|`|gNqVzt0iaa	lol, it has both pizza and pasta and a salad bar. its well nice.|`|A57k6mj6aa	It still has pizza.|`|GJJyon0naa	Pizza ad pasta are the same crayon girl. Paste is juss smilier pizza. Gah do I have to get <br>  Barney down there? B/c I will!|`|zQQd2wPRaa	you have that in the uk?! cool! and yea silly i think they are saving their arsses because their pizza is going down hill.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Pizza Pasta Hut is the new name. You'll find out when you get there.
Y47WgY4Laa	I'm not sure if this is the one you're thinking of, but there used to be a restaurant on Finchley Road called 'Just Around The Corner' that let people pay what they thought was fair.    "...it is the only restaurant where YOU decide how much the meal is worth and pay accordingly. No fuss about bills and sharing, you just work it out by yourself and pay at the end. In the 14 years the restaurant has been running the landlord claims he never had a disagreement over a bill. As a result, the service is superb (the waitress has been there for 3 years!)"    http://www.thelondonrestaurantreview.co....
