Cons: No dust cover..., doesn't handle Cs or Ds, but only AAs and AAAs.<br>  <br>  There is a similar charger out there, if I remember correctly, that looks almost exactly like this one, except it has 4 LEDs, which means it charges pairs of batteries only, which would put you back where you are now.<br>  <br>  To assure you're getting a charger that can charge batteries individually, the charger should have one (1) LED per battery position.

CQA4HAdmaa	PROs<br>  It allows you to play more games, use music from a lot of other sources and to make and receive phone VOIP phone calls.  Contrary to what others say, it's not illegal.  There is no law anywhere saying it's illegal. If you buy a piece of hardware that comes with software, it's yours to use an do as you wish.  If you want to put in a different battery than what Apple uses to upgrade it with what ever software you want, you can. <br>  <br>  JAILBREAKING WITHOUT INVALIDATING YOUR WARRANTY:<br>  I have provided you a link that will enable you to do some jail breaking without invalidating you warranty.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cons<br>  The only con is that if something goes wrong with it, you will need to reset it to the Apple factory setting and then have Apple check it out.  If you reset it to Apple setting, then re-jail break it.<br>  <br>  The Apple Warranty is voided if it breaks and you cannot set it back to factory setting.  I've never seen an iPod that cannot be brought back to factory setting after being jailbroken.  Jail breaking cannot ruin your iPod, unless you really have some bad software. If you have a new touch, you will have to down grade the firmware to 1.1.1 <br>  <br>  As long as you legally purchased your iPod and got your software from legitimate sources (not stolen), using different software it is not illegal.  Below is a great link that works for both iTouch and IPhone that allows it them to work as VOIP phones.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of sources to find them.  In my view if you spend all that money, you should limit yourself to what Apple provides.  If they can't keep up with all the new applications out there, the user should not be limited because of it.  They should not be building in obsolescence-And shame on them for trying it.|`|fCl9R8WKaa	First of all, It's all legal. You bough the Ipod/Iphone, you do what you want with it. It's illegal when you download cracked apps though.<br>  The good thing is that you can have so many more apps that Apple has not approved for the app store. You can have emulators for NES, Gameboy, PS1 and play games like mario and stuff. There are tons of ways to customize it with all the backgrounds and Winterboard.<br>  <br>  The bad things are is that it's kind of hard to do it with the 2nd generation. If you have the 2g, you wont be able to turn it off and if you do, you have to connect it to your PC to get it back on. The first generation it's really easy to jailbreak.

Well my friends, it’s called Jailbreaking your Ipod, and with a little help from friends Google and Youtube you will soon find yourself with an even better product than you even thought!<br>  <br>  The basic going on is this. New Ipod Touch’s come with Firmware 1.1.2 so in order to complete the Jailbreak you will need to DOWNGRADE the firmaware back to 1.1.1 which can be downloaded from sources (use Google, and there are a number of Youtube guides that will run you through the process and give you links). Once this has been completed you will also need to run the Jailbreak app on your PC or Mac (I used a Mac to complete my Jailbreak) and a good 15 minutes and 3 or 4 restarts later you will be able to get your Ipod to update back to Firmware 1.1.2<br>  <br>  So now you will be taken back to your springboard and should notice two new apps, OpenSSH and Installer. Click on installer and using your WiFi it will open up a program that has pretty much EVERY app you will ever need. Here you can install all the beloved Iphone apps including Google Maps, weather, stocks, Mail and all that which work as intended, I especially love the mail app  <br>  <br>   BUT then there are another group of cool apps such as Ebooks, Sketch, Apollo (fills in all you IM needs with MSN, Yahoo, AIM and ICQ) and my two favourite apps Summerboard and MobileScrobbler<br>  <br>  Summerboard changes the springboard from the plain back background to anything you want in the way of sexy looking themes!<br>  <br>   Mobile Scrobbler is a program for LastFM users. Insert your information and it will scrobble your plays directly to your site. If you are in a non WiFi area it’s ok, MobileScrobbler will just queue your songs and when you connect to your WiFi will update you page for you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Con:<br>  You will get access to hundreds of awesome third party apps that will send your ipod touch straight to the nex generation. Doing this will void your warranty though. Go to jailbreakme.com on your itouch and and click install appsnap. Your ipod will temporarily crash and restart. There will bbe an installer application on your home screen. Have fun|`|QM0Z9c3Laa	There currently isn't really a downside to jailbreaking because if you accidently screw up something and your ipod gets corrupted, you can simply restore it in itunes.<br>  <br>  Things you can do with a jailbroken iphone/itouch include:<br>  <br>  custom themes and settings,<br>  <br>  get almost any app for free,<br>  <br>  ability to install apps that apple does not approve of (for example pdanet which if you had an iphone, lets you use your data plan with a laptop for free internet anywhere)<br>  <br>  etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  However, apple did recently announce that jailbreaking your iphone/itouch is illegal.

So if i was you i would just buy the app.

xTioPxaVaa	The Dot is one of those really good deals as far as Epiphones go.  It will sound similar to your Les Paul, but with a little better attack and more pronounced midrange.  If you've got a LP and a Strat now, I'd either recommend a semi-hollow body (like the dot) or a guitar with P90 pickups.<br>  <br>  There are two lines of the Dot.  The original Dot sells for about $400, and the Dot Studio about $300.  The studio version doesn't have as nice a finish or hardware.  Both those prices are without a case.<br>  <br>  If you've got a chance to score one with a case for 2 bills (and the guitar is in good shape with no damage), it sounds like a good deal if it's a studio and a great deal if it's an original Dot.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

6GIrW5eWaa	Good Questions, although I am a little confused about the storage question/device. First off they will attempt to fix your original system. If they cannot they will send you a refurbished (repaired) system. The turn around time is between 3 and 5 weeks but I understand, based on what I have read here, it could be quicker. You wil not get a brand new system per say. <br>  <br>  You store your xbox where in the original box? so you use it how often? I had to piece part things together on this part of the question. So you are saying that when you are done using it you disconnect the system and then put it in the box and then store it? Is this correct? If this is the case then by all means please store it in a bag. When you get it back it will be in one actually so use the bag that Microsoft sends the console back in. Good Luck<br>  <br>  Edit: Sometimes its not a matter of storage and or how good or bad we treat our systems they are going to fail. As long as we take precautions we can extend the length or life span of them. If you feel that you do have a dust issue, prior to storing it in the back. Buy yourself a can of air and before storing it just give it a nice little air blast to blow it off first. It certainly can't hurt it. Just make sure that you do not blow too close to the system or directly into the holes. again I say good luck

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera.

The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.

aqt3QCMqaa	I wouldn't go with either. I recommend the Sony Alpha cameras, either the 200 or 350. They have built in image stabilization ( to eliminate photo blur ) which the other two do not have.

I do not know with absolute certainty that the demos will work or not- but all updates/patches are available for PC download. We did the original xbox games update and a couple of patches like that before we got our home network set up.|`|pod9nzo7aa	Burn your Xbox and get a Wii. That would solve it.
n46fsdNZaa	Well it never hurts to call XBOX they have a number and they might have some things that they can walk you through.  Have you checked to see if you have it in HD if the switch on the back is actually HD and not regular tv.  Or I have done it many times before where I have it on the wrong component on the tv and the XBOX is actually showing on the other channel hopefully I could help.

pOU8l2ofaa	If you registered it then if you inform Sony that it was stolen they should be able to tell you They'll also block any PSN account that is coming from that PS3 until you say you got it back.<br>  <br>  If you didn't I'm sorry but I don't see any way to prove it.<br>  <br>  <br>  I actually found this for you it might help.<br>  <br>  <br>  Assuming your PS3 is stolen, do this: <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  If you know your MAC address and serial number for your PS3, great, and give it to the officer / police dispatcher when filing your initial report. Then sit back, have a smoke, and wait for results!!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Guess what?? People get themselves murdered.......banks get themselves robbed........and drug dealers.....they deal drugs, and stab crack addicts!! Basically, the police are busy, and detectives may not be "hot on the trail" of your stolen property in a timely manner based on your years of watching Colombo. So make sure you do the following:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  1. Find out the officer/detectives name and phone number assigned to your case (there will be one attached to it, despite however many donut crumbs rest upon it).<br>  <br>  2. Due to multiple factors (other active investigations, officer being very old and not knowing his nerd like options, etc) you may want to see if these steps are being utilized.....<br>  <br>  3. The detective can contact SCEA in Foster City, CA, speak with one of their IT Security officers, who in turn will give them the necessary wording for what they need to see on a search authorization.<br>  <br>  4. The search request asks SCEA security to track the MAC address of the property, and label it as "stolen" (relating to an investigation). If the property shows up, the security folk can forward the information attained back to the law enforcement officer. SCEA has the ability to track MAC's, but needs access to an overseas office to run a serial number to get your MAC address (assuming you only know the serial number).<br>  <br>  5. The detective in turn types this paperwork up, brings it to the magistrate, and the judge signs off on it (judges do this so often, they don't need a "song and dance" from the officer, just the gist).<br>  <br>  6. Now assuming sometime later, said "bad guy" plugs in your PS3, even if only to test his network, Sony will know. In rare occasions the bad guy sells the PS3, and the innocent bystander that purchases it (not knowing it's stolen) not only goes online, but registers it with an email address, home address, credit card, etc. All of this information is available to law enforcement personnel.<br>  <br>  7. Sooner or later (even if it's a few months down the road) your stolen PS3 will more then likely jump online. When this happens, Sony gets whatever information they can, even if it's just an IP address and starts investigating. If it's just the IP, they also get what general area the IP came from, and what service is providing the internet to the dwelling in question.<br>  <br>  8. The officer then takes that info, draws up another search authorization for whatever internet provider service, and requests the physical address of where the IP originated from. From there it's simply a matter of them showing up with a search warrant for the location, and finding the PS3. The person inside might have no idea (innocent guy having purchased it from Craiglist) or may in fact be the suspect himself. A lot of times detectives will go this route, because not only are they finding your property......but chances are they will stumble across even more stolen property, or some other type of criminal activity.|`|Ob6gDJhgaa	Yes!

Xxviy63Paa	PS4 in 2012 powered by what? The same Cell engine?<br>  <br>  It will take until 2012 for games to even use the full power of the ps3. The last thing Sony is gonna do then is pull the rug out from under ps3 game sales! <br>  <br>  Besides that, the current generation is at the core processing limit. The fastest a single processor can get is about 3.2 ghz, after that it runs inefficient and overheats above 4ghz. There's ways to make them go faster but it hasn't even been implemented in pc's yet, the tech is so new. So every pc and console that wants to go faster has to put in multiple cores. This creates horrible heat problems, like in the xbox360, and is hard to program for, like ps3. The ps3 has a total of 8 3.2ghz processors which is about as much as any machine can have. A top-line pc has only 4.<br>  <br>  To make the ps3 any better would mean putting in a better graphics card. That's another pointless thing. The new Direct X 10 ATI and Nvidia cards have not even got a majority of the pc gaming market. Almost all games still work on Direct X 9 cards, and there is no sign of that changing soon. The PS3's RSX is capable of matching the best pc games still, because the developers haven't made software to match the new hardware. There is no point making even more new hardware, when the software hasn't caught up with the old hardware yet.<br>  <br>  The next console generation will consist of new core technology, and that is at least 6 years away, considering the current recession. And that the ps3 is designed to be competitive till 2016. The only new consoles you'll see by 2012 will be a new Nintendo to replace the weak Wii, and maybe a Microsoft portable. <br>  <br>  One more thing, you shouldn't be all hung up on graphics. I remember that from the old days on commodore 64. You can push any game that sucks by saying it has good graphics. What matters is design, control, interface, networking, versatility and fun. If all you want is graphics, get a blu-ray movie, you can't beat that for graphics.|`|pl2SocVKaa	possibly it will be in that range from 2012 to 2014 graphics would be insane the chip that they will use in it will be phenomenal when it comes out it will be the strongest system ever probably as powerful as 8 ps3s  ut i really donm't think in 2012 because theyt probably won't release it until ps3 becomes number 1 topping the wii|`|pOi0wewIaa	PS3 has a life expansion of 10 years <br>  <br>  So I would really think that PS4 would come out in 2016 or 2019 in my prediction. <br>  <br>  If Sony is having a PS4 in 2012, then that's the DUMBEST move ever cause they just considered themselves lost in the console war of PS3/360. And they would have to pay BIG money to support the PSP 3000 or 4000 and the PS3 and now the PS4, (Don't forget about PSN too)|`|fWclxi9Baa	2016 sounds more resonable ps3 was released in 06 and there is no play to release the ps4 in 2012 especially with how bad it had sold so far it could last more then 10 yrs|`|VWILDaYPaa	they might drag it out. because thats what 360 plans on doing.2012 sounds about right tho. i dont think thr gunna go any longer than 2014.|`|7OHudVxiaa	my brother went to a meeting for somthing, they said its released in 2011|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	i hope they don't try to rush it like the ps3 because they saw xbox getting so much attention they just started boxing bricked ps3s. so i hope xbox comes out in 2012 then ps3 waits tell 2014 so they don't get shown up by the gay little wii. i mean who buys those little crappy things it doesn't make sense the only game people play is the wii sports. so from now on i don't want anymore gay console wars i just want a super duper ps4 cause i know ps4 will be the best console ever made. i hope the ps4 is released before he end of the world.|`|p9W2CysKaa	Well I personally think that it should be 2012 but they shouldn't rush it they should a lot of features so i think that it should be from 2012-2015

Turn down your graphics settings on Halo.<br>  <br>  And if all of those don't work (I suggest doing them all together) reinstall the game. If that doesn't work, you probably can't play the game on your computer.|`|XqzH0l0Maa	may mean that your computer is working harder than it can. you may have too much taking up space on your computer. if you can go through and uninstall the programs you dont use or clean out history/cookies/temp internet files it may clear it up for the time being.

c1sRWiX3aa	Click the link below and then click the 'register a console' link. Once you are registered you'll then click the 'repair your console' link.<br>  <br>  Note: If your 360 is over a year old it will tell you that you are 'out of warranty' when you register it. However, when you go through the repair process and put in that you had the three red rings it will go ahead and process your repair free of charge (since the warranty for the RROD is for three years, not one.)<br>  <br>  One final thought. I would choose the 'email me my shipping label' method. Granted, you don't get a shipping box this way, but you have your shipping label immediately versus having to wait an extra three or four days for the box to arrive.<br>  <br>  If you go to any UPS shipping store they can sell you the box and shipping 'peanuts' for a little over three dollars. In my opinion the three or four days you save in waiting for the box to arrive is worth the three or so dollars you have to shell out.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

RpCwfcRzaa	1. usually 720p<br>  <br>  2. The Pro comes with HD/ standard cables. Six plugs in all and a switch to change from HD to standard. <br>  <br>  3. There is a small portion of original Xbox games that are backwards compatible and some of those games are available as downlaods from Xbox Live for 1200 Microsoft Points. <br>  <br>  4. Partially true. You can copy games onto the hard drive to reduce load times and the wear on your dick drive, but you still need the disk in the drive to verify that you own it. <br>  <br>  5. Each game varies. A large game like Oblivion takes up 7 GB on my hard drive. GTA takes up 6. The original Xbox games available on the Marketplace also vary. On mine, Indigo Prophecy takes up 2.6 GB, Dreamfall has 2.5, and Stubbs the Zombie is 1.4GB. Expect them to take up around 2 GB on average. The actual original Xbox game disks take up a few KB up to a few MB for the progress saves. You can't save the entire game onto the hard drive like with the 360 titles. <br>  <br>  6. All 3 versions of the 360 come with the base free Silver subscription. You can download demos, TV shows, and movies from the Marketplace and send text and voice messages to friends with it. Gold is what you pay for. You can do everything you can with Silver plus access high profile demos early and play online multiplayer games. The prices are $8 for a month, $20 for 3 months, or $50 for a year of Gold. <br>  <br>  7. You need around 200 kbps upload and 1300 download to play on Live without issues. Anything higher is of course better.|`|wIM3vNtwaa	1. At least 720p<br>  <br>  2. Component HD AV Cables (Premium System). These can do HD visuals and sound as well as standard. The Elite comes with an HDMi cable as well. You only need the HDMi cable (if you use it) for sound and visuals<br>  <br>  3. Yes, not all work though. You can download original XBOX games from the marketplace but it is not free (I haven't seen this feature in a while, ever since they brought out NXE)<br>  <br>  4. You can install (copy) games to hard drive but you still have to use the disc to prevent piracy (it just doesn't read it. It's only used to check you own the game). XBOX 1 games do not have this feature.<br>  <br>  5. A full 360 game (when copied to Hard Drive) takes 9GB. An individual game's save date is far less than a 1GB in space (mere MB per game)<br>  <br>  6. XBOX Live Silver, yes, but this doesn't let you play games with others online (That's why it's free). You have to pay for XBOX Live Gold which does let you play others online.<br>  <br>  7. I use 1mb broadband and my XBL is perfectly fine|`|9AwGOnysaa	Well, I thnik a standard xbox doesn't come with HDMI... i know my elite can, but my standard one doesnt even have the plugging (its kinda old lol)<br>  <br>  You play only certain xbox 1 games on the xbox 360, xbox.com has a list somewhere, or u can just google it. (i know the demo discs from official xbox magazine has updates for backward compatibility)<br>  <br>  You can download certain games from xbox 1 on marketplace to your 360, but its not free :'(<br>  <br>  You can install xbox 360 discs to your hard drive, BUT in order to play from the hardrive, you need the disc in the tray.. its to prevent people from renting and installing it and keeping it forever :\ (the purpose to install it to hardrive is that it makes basically no noise when it's on, it freezes WAY less, and it also loads slightly faster)<br>  <br>  When you download xbox 1 games to your hardrive, well when i downloaded one i think it took 6 GB, but its different for every game. Oh and also if you download too much stuff and need to delete space, even if you delete things you paid for, its yours forever, and you get to re-download it for free :D (only on that specific account you downloaded it first on though)<br>  <br>  Silver membership is basically nothing, you cant have private chats, you cant play games on live, i dont even think you can invite people to your friends list... its basically nothing, but i think its only 70$ a year to subscribe to gold<br>  <br>  And lastly, (from everythig I know) when you buy an xbox you get gold membership free for 1 month :D|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Ok ill just follow your list and tell you what I know.<br>  <br>  1. Just about all games are I believe able to be put into 720p<br>  <br>  2. The standard cable is a combo A/V and component cable(red/blue/green) If you want you can opt to buy a HDMI cable. And no you don't need a separate cable.<br>  <br>  3. Yes you can play xbox game on the 360 however not all games are playable a full list can be found here <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backward...</a>  also No you have to pay for any game you download. Normal cost is 1200 MS points. <br>  <br>  4. Yes you can copy games to the HD but you have to have the Disc in the tray to play them. Otherwise you might rent a game copy it and never buy it. There is no way around this don't bother. Im not sure if it can be done with the Xbox games I don't think so though.<br>  <br>  5. A normal games takes up around 4GB. Original Xbox games Might take up the same or a little less (if you can again I don't know)<br>  <br>  6. Xbox Live silver allows you to make a friends list and Download stuff from the marketplace (at a cost to you) but you can not play with people online. Xbox live gold allows you to play with people online and gives you all the features the silver has. Gold cost:<br>  $7.99-1 month.<br>  $19.99-3 month<br>  $50-1 year<br>  A list of xbox live features can be found here <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/goldBenefits.htm" rel="nofollow">http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/goldBe...</a><br>  <br>  7. The only requirement is broadband speed. However the faster the better.|`|ihtUSk4Yaa	1. 1080 p ?!?!?!? i think<br>  <br>  2.the 360 comes with regular and HDMI avi cables<br>  <br>  3.no it is not free it cost microsoft points, but u can play certain games from xbox orig, if they are on the marketplace, ex) halo, san andreas, psychonauts, etc.<br>  <br>  4. u can instal ur games to ur hard drive but u still need the discs, all this does is quicken load times and put an ease to ur laser in the disc drive, and i dont think u can do it with xbox1 games<br>  <br>  5.well it depends on how big the game is, ex) i installed GTA4 to my hard drive and it took u 7.9 gigs but thats because its a big game, and usually xbox1 games are half a gig<br>  <br>  6.u get free for a month when u join but then have to pay($60 for a year, $35ish for 6 months) i would suggest it though the online is amazing<br>  <br>  7.my friend plays Call of Duty 4 with dial up so i thonk u might be fine you will just have lots of lag|`|t64wxdcJaa	1. im not really sure but i think HD<br>  <br>  2. Standard and HD<br>  <br>  3. You can play some, but not all, and no the xbox 1 game downloads arent free<br>  <br>  4. You can, but you have to mod it<br>  <br>  5. It's different for each game but unless you get more than 60 games, you should be fine<br>  <br>  6.Yes, the xbox comes with one month of gold, but then you have to pay. if you don't pay they switch it to silver, which just lets you buy stuff and talk to friends ( no online games)<br>  <br>  7.??? i don't think you have to have a minimum internet speed|`|WGZGSCzuaa	1. 720p is the xbox's native resolution<br>  <br>  2. They come with HDMI cables, and you dont need any extra optical, digital cables<br>  <br>  3.You can play alot of them if you have he disc, you can also download original xbox games off of marketplace, but they cost money.<br>  <br>  4.You can save games to your hard drive, but you still need to put the disc in to verify you own the game, it just wont spin.<br>  <br>  5. around 250mb and it also depends on the downloadable content for each game.<br>  <br>  6.xbox live silver means you can browse marketplace, and have a friends list, but you wont be able to play online. Gold live is around $60 dollars a year and you get all of the silver bonus' and can play games online<br>  <br>  7.any cable or dsl, from experience cable is much better.

IHHr1mutaa	You'll need a Phone as Modem plan on your cell account. Call your service provider and ask to speak to their Data Support folks. They should be able to get you set up and connected to use your phone as a Modem.  I'm not 100 percent certain but you may need to do it via USB cable as I am not sure that the L7c has an option to push internet via Bluetooth. You'll have to check to see if it has that Bluetooth Profile. I believe it is the PAN Bluetooth profile.

J8YRJUtFaa	It's fun & party/family game.Good for social gaming.<br>  Not a button mashing game for hardcore gamers like shooting,plat-former,Vs fighting etc.|`|3AChQgbZaa	becasue its fun.  thats really the bottom line|`|pl2SocVKaa	well it isn't on the top 10 lists of everyone anymore it was on there because of the create and play style online for that main reason but people like it because its that classic side scroller platformer game but its creative so thats why its getting that praise but if its not interesting to you by all means don't get it|`|AA10365008	It's a good game. It's fun, and if you're in to designing stuff, then this game is perfect for you. I myself did not have much interest in it when it came out, and I just got it two weeks ago, and it's pretty much all I've played!<br>  The game does have a story mode, and by finishing the story mode, you unlock new items to help you along the way of creating your own levels.<br>  The strongest point in this game is the fact that it allows you to create your own levels, dress your own characters, etc. One thing I really love about it, is that you can take pictures with your PS eye and use them in the game!|`|0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	The graphics of the materials is very realistic and the game is really fun especially when playing with friends or just with random people online. And if ur the creative type of person then u will love how u can make almost anything out of ur imagination with the materials and tool in the game, and u can publish ur created levels online so others can play it and rate it plus u get trophies if certain number of ppl played and hearted ur levels and you as an author.|`|pOi0wewIaa	Don't get it if you don't like it<br>  <br>  <br>  That Q is just like saying that why do people like Killzone 2 so much I mean really it's just a regular shooting game.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways, I like this game because you get to use your imagination and create a level. Also, this game is just like Mario, but better version kinda and it's pretty fun.|`|fWclxi9Baa	you can create your on levels play custom levels and its all puzzle types of games its fun i like it alot but its not as addicting as the cod games|`|jN5SXl5Caa	It's fun because technically it is never ending content. The levels on the disk are fun and you get prizes to create new stuff in your own level, but the best part for me was the community levels. They were fun to play, even though most are more like art than a game. In fact that's a great way to put it. The game is like art you can play with. People make these levels and you get to check them out. None of them are very challenging but they are fun. To be honest though I mostly play this with my fiance because it's light and cheery. I too had a lot of fun creating levels. I also spent a lot of time doing it and it was still crap. but it is a fun game and a very creative concept to say the least.|`|sBKdutqFaa	It's really a pointless game.  It's a sort of 2D/3D blended platform game, but it's enjoyable because it isn't intense and it's for fun =].  You just run through different courses with a character that you can design and accessorize.  Some are races, others are spectacles - like people make Ghostbusters, Super Mario, Kingdom Hearts themed levels.  Guess if you like Katamari you'll like Little Big Planet.|`|DQ8Y2mIDaa	i played it once its boring its the pretty much the same levels over and over the only people that play it are kids and family's and lots of couples play it together. its just a family game lots of people enjoy, personally i found it unattractive, but my sister played it a lot. the only thing that took up my time was making a level that took lots of my time and it still sucked lol, i think its on the top ten because people bought it for curiosity and just let it gather dust on there shelfs afterwards.|`|aMZgwklvaa	you will love it if you like platformers. it's like the mother of all platformers, no wait mario is, but it's the best. it's also a nice way to relax and unwind because it's not that intense but fun to play. the create mode is incredible and simple to use once you know how to use it and some of the user created levels are simply amazing. i guess it's really a matter of opinion to some but i think i speak for most of us when i say that it's great!|`|2ugADB05aa	First of all LittleBigPlanet has no story.  I like the game I don't create levels I just play other peoples levels online with new levels been added all the time adds a lot of replay value. I mostly like the the game as it's like the old school platform games.|`|ZK5vyVInaa	I got this game and i didn't like it. I still have it here just for my 6 year old sister. Umm.. I think people like it because you can create your own world and its pretty fun two player, otherwise i don't understand what's going on either.

q8cBE6w8aa	It is possible that a camera  has a short, and it drains the batteries.  but that is unlikely.  More likely, it is the type of battery you use.  Digital camera manufacturers do not give any or little advice on this subject - at least i have not seen it.<br>  <br>  You don't say what kind of batteries you are using, so i will give you my experience, which I learned the hard way.<br>  <br>  Alkaline batteries just don't work well with digital cameras, and are single use.  The load required is too great for alkaline.  This happened to me on more than one camera, and I have read about lots of people having this problem on internet forums.<br>  <br>  Lithium batteries are much better than alkaline, but very expensive and also single use.  Too expensive when there is a far cheaper alternative which I now use and am amazed how well they work.<br>  <br>  Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries are ok, but expensive and not as good as the ones I describe below.  I have Nikon lithium-ion's for my digital camera, but they were very  expensive.<br>  <br>  The successful batteries I use are NiMH, nickel metal hydride.  This is not just the ordinary NiMH, these are the newly designed ones, for sale only in the last few years.  There are still early version NiMH for sale, but not very good because they lose their charge over time.  This is called self discharge.  I was using this old version, and the self discharge was terrible.<br>  <br>  The new design rechargeable NiMH have a very low self discharge, claimed to be 85 percent of the charge left after one year.  As well, they are fine for the high load needed for digital cameras.  I have used a set of Eneloop AA batteries and a Eneloop charger, plus several sets of Kodak NiMH AA's also charging with the Eneloop charger.  You may never have heard of Eneloop, but they are one of the leaders for this advanced battery, and are available at Costco for an amazing price.  I got all mine at Wal-Mart  in Dec. 2007, and  the price was so inexpensive I bought just a few to try out, and went back for the rest a week later (now a total of 20 AA's).  Batteries of this type come pre-charged, and can be used right out of the package.  I use them in my wireless mouse, camera, cd disk player, etc.  I have a couple relatives also happily using these type.<br>  <br>  The new batteries take a large number of pictures, over several weeks, without recharging, and sitting on the shelf in the camera between uses.<br>  <br>  Check the following link. You may also find forums on the internet where this subject is discussed.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	It depends.  <br>  <br>  If your camera is using a Li-ion battery, then no ... they should hold their charge for weeks if not longer. <br>  <br>  If you are using AA NiMH batteries, they do lose some power over time, especially if they were not charged before the camera was put a way.<br>  <br>  There is some trickle of power going to the camera if for no other reason, to keep the clock running on-board the camera
Hjuh6PG0aa	Well, it's NOT doable. There is no way to get free ringtones on a Sidekick. People have been trying for years, believe me. These phones are locked down so that you can't get free ringtones. Everything you get has to be bought from the catalog. It DOES suck but that's the price you pay for owning a Sidekick. :( Sorry that this wasn't the answer you were looking for. And NO you can't get them via USB cable either.

Ns6I7MmBaa	Not sure why theone78 says you don't need an HD cable box for HD since non-HD is only 480 lines.  But Direct TV is not cable anyway.<br>  <br>  Theoretically HDMI should work best, since it is digital.  Some HDTV's work well with component (3 video cables plus audio cables), but some do not.  My older HDTV ready LCD tended to overscan (magnify) component.<br>  <br>  If you ever connect an up converting DVD player or BlueRay you would have to use HDMI (or DVI to HDMI) to take advantage of that, since component on those is limited to 480p due to entertainment industry agreements.|`|UinOWcMUaa	No.... since your TV is only 720p... all you will need is componet cables (r,g,b). Only TV's rated for 1080p require a(n) HDMI cable to push a 1080p picture :). You don't even need an HD Turner from your cable company, because your regular cable box, can broadcast a 720p signal. Only 1080p TV's need a HD cable box !!!<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new TV :)
6GB5P7ojaa	Your Xbox 360 may not be able to play the game because it cannot support the game yet and because the game doesn't support backwards-compatibility.<br>  <br>  Here's the link to the list of backwards-compatible games:<br>  <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardcompatibilitygameslist.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backward...</a><br>  <br>  They update this list so keep checking back<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|9AR6B4ELaa	good question<br>  <br>  its either that that game does not support backwards compatibility OR that the game has some defect in it|`|zPu9tppgaa	If you are in a different country to the one in which you purchased your XBOX it may not be capable of playing other countries games.<br>  <br>  Check out the XBOX to see if it plays PAL or NTSC games. If the games are PAL and your box is PAL there is something wrong with the games, likewise with NTSC.<br>  <br>  You may need to update the games/xbox to play them but I don't think I have come across a game needing to update before.

I was surprised there was no installing, load menus were manageable. Speaking of the menus, they were easy to navigate, animated when you move your controller and are pretty cool.<br>  <br>  Being a beta tester, i got straight into a small game of 2-8 players. We did body count, search and destroy, search and retrieve and assassination. All games were really fun, especially the last one where you have to protect a target, which was me.<br>  <br>  The guns i used were the standard ISA and helghast rifle as it takes a while to unlock anything new. After ranking up and getting used to everything in small games, i went for a full on 32 player match which was immense. So much action everywhere, the game looked amazing and i didnt even go negative, went 14 kills and 9 deaths.<br>  <br>  After about 3 hours online i started the story. Completed the first mission which was in the demo. Carried onto more checkpoints helping the ISA people get settled into the helghast planet.<br>  <br>  AI was pretty bad ***, they took cover, threw grenades and were so lifelike. I got killed 2 times by rockets which shows how hard AI can be. Not once did i find a 'dummy' AI just standing there, it was all real.<br>  <br>  I killed my first boss i guess, it wasnt anything major, just a buffed up helghast. Shot him in the head and blew him up because he had tanks on his back for his huge gun. But i expect much more badass bossess to come yet.<br>  <br>  Just finished up now as i felt i done enough for today.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	While most cameras take video, and some camcorders take photos; to get the best of both, you need both. Have not seen a camera that compares with the video from a camcorder and camcorders can't take good quality photos.  Suggest the least expensive Canon Camcorder and the Canon A590IS camera.<br>  <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ...

There are camcorders that produce good stills, and still cameras that do good video, but you are still better off with two. <br>  <br>  I have routinely used video on still cameras and stills on video cameras, but you have to know what to expect. Let's take my video camera.. I have several, but on a 2-week backpacking trip in the mountains of New Mexico, I took only my Canon HV10. This is a high-definition camcorder with a 3-ish megapixel lens (full 1080p high-def video is about 2 megapixels). It does stellar video... very close to my pro-class Sony (the same sensor is in the more feature-packed HV20 and HV30, but I got the HV10 for backpack use... it was the smallest HD camcorder back then). <br>  <br>  For stills, I'm getting somewhere around 3 mpixels... which is a bit weak. Standard photo printers use a minimum resolution of 240 dpi (dots per inch), which is about what you need to see a seamless (unpixelated) photo. Inkjets of course have high dpi numbers, but that's for a single color... they need several dots of ink to make up one 24-bit pixel. So, based on this, you need at least a 1.5Mpixel camera for 4x6 prints, at least 2Mpixel for 5x7 prints, and at least a 5Mpixel camera for 8x10 prints. People get by with less.. I've made 8x10s from my old Canon Pro90 (2.6Mpixels), but you'll see the difference if you know what to look for. <br>  <br>  The good news these days: memory is so cheap, you should ALWAYS shoot at the top quality of your camera. The bad news... most video cameras are not a match for even cheap still cameras on stills. Another problem is the sensor.. less of an issue in a modern video camera, but many video cameras have interlace-only sensors. When you shoot a still, you're actually getting two blended fields, which just looks bad compared to a progressive (non-interlaced) shot. This is more a thing of the past, but an issue to at least understand. <br>  <br>  On the still camera side, I have two DSLRs with no video features, so let's talk about point & shoot digitals. I have a Panasonic DMC-TZ5, which is a pretty nice pocket digital, with a nice sharp 10:1 zoom lens, optical image stabilization, and lots of features. This has a higher megapixel count than either DSLR, but won't quite match their quality... P&S sensors are so much smaller than DSLR sensors, there is a compromise. On the other hand, this is going to get you higher quality photos than just about any consumer-level film camera.<br>  <br>  I have one 8GB SDHC card for this camera, which cost me $20 over a year ago. You can find these for $10 today, and that gets me 2,000 photos at top quality. There is no discernible reason to shoot at lower resolution.. in fact, on my DSLRs, I shoot everything in RAW format. You always want the best quality digital original. And it has nothing to do with your intentions today... printing 4x6s or whatever. But if you're even remotely into photography, you'll keep a library of photos for years.. mine goes back to the 1970s. You may use photos in other projects, you may want to cropping and other creative effects, etc. Memory is insanely cheap... don't get that once-in-a-lifetime shot, only to discover you had the camera in YouTube mode. <br>  <br>  The TZ5 does video, too, in fact, it does HD video... sort of.. 1280x720/30p, rather than 1440x1080/60i in my camcorders (or 1920x1080 in tapeless models). It's not bad, but it's not HD-camcorder quality, either. And here's the thing.. the TZ5 was one of the first digital still cameras to have full video features in video mode: you can autofocus, you can zoom, etc. Many with video modes cut out a bunch of normal features. <br>  <br>  And even at that, it's not perfect. Digital still cameras and video cameras have completely different needs for focus. A still camera has to focus once, as quickly as possible. A video camera has to change focus slowly enough to not be noticed in normal filming. The TZ5 totally failed at this originally... newer software helps, but it's still an issue. Also, most still cameras have limits -- 10 or 20 minutes or less of video. And the audio on nearly all of them is horrible.. a tiny microphone, usually mono not stereo, and often located right where you fingers want to go. <br>  <br>  With that said, I have used TZ5 video mixed with video from real camcorders. With some work, it was worth having, but I wouldn't settle for this as my only video camera. <br>  <br>  So while there are plenty of very good still and video cameras, I can't recommend any one for both jobs. They get better every year, but it's still a process. And it's not just the quality, but the other features: the focusing, shooting time, viewfinders, video or still formats, sensor optimizations, etc.|`|Z2cbezZDaa	My ex-boss is pleased with the results he gets with a Sanyo Xacti.

I thought it was a good deal.|`|RyvKws7Laa	I think the best choice overall at that size is the Panasonic TC-37LZ85.  But I think it'll likely push a bit out of your price range.  For that price range I would take a hard look at a Sony Bravia KDL-37L4000.  I think that might be attainable towards your budget and still deliver very good picture quality.  I forget the model number, but there is a Toshiba Regza also 37" in around your budget range that performs quite well.

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	I have never heard so much unmitigated BS in my life.  The Olympus camera is superb, the lenses are the best in the market, and the features are all there.  For $269 difference, I would not even blink, I would buy the Olympus.  <br>  <br>  There is so much garbage said about Nikon and Canon being the only choices.  That is nothing but an ego trip.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	Do some more shopping, the XSi should be comparable in cost.  Also vet Future Shop at <a href="http://www.resellerratings.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.resellerratings.com/</a> or some equivalent site, the price might be "too good to be true". The Olympus probably would be a good camera to have, but the Canon or Nikon would be a better long term place to invest your time and money.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	I would recommend the Canon over the Olympus. The Olympus is a good camera but it has the smallest sensor of all the DSLR's. This leads to higher noise levels and less detail and dynamic range. The Olympus also uses the 4/3 system which allows the camera to be lighter and smaller but means that for standard size prints everything will need to be cropped. Just like your photos from a point and shoot camera need to be. <br>  If you ever plan on going somewhere with your photography then Canon and Nikon are the only real choice for professional level DSLR's and lenses.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Absolutely worth the extra money.  Compare the features between the two camera.  Also, I would recommend cannon lenses with cannon camera, not just because of the obvious matching hardware, but more importantly because Cannon lenses are among the best on the market.

You can get an external card reader at Walmart for under 10.00 and they read all cards.<br>  You can hook your camera up with a USB cord, put it in play back mode and go to MyComputer and open the camera icon, then copy/paste from your card to your pictures file. I suggest getting a 2 or 4G flash drive to save your picture too since it isn't your computer.|`|c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	There may be USB ports in the front and rear of your computer. Try the one you are not using now and you may have success. Also, install any software that came with your camera and turn the camera on in Review Mode.<br>   <br>  There is an option in the Control Panel or Yahoo Messenger, Preferences (Calling & Audio) to select back or front USB and Audio inputs.  If you can find this place you may be able to choose the one you want to use, but until then just use the one you are not using now.<br>   <br>  If you are still having trouble, the following information describes a better way to move/copy photos to and from a computer or memory card.<br>   <br>  Just received some pictures in an e-mail which I moved to the computer.  Then copied these pictures to a memory card and could view them on my camera or show on TV.<br>    <br>  If your computer has memory card slots, find the correct slot and copy pictures from the memory card to the computer.<br>   <br>  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  After you have the memory card plugged in, go to My Computer and open the memory card, select the picture you want to copy, and then copy to the My Pictures folder under My Documents under Documents and Settings.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore.

Make and select a sub folder then click Copy.<br>   <br>   <br>  You can also copy from the computer to a memory card. <br>   <br>  Have just been playing with this and found that it works really well, but you should first format the memory card in the camera because it adds files to the card you will need.<br>   <br>  Next, take a picture of something with the camera.<br>   <br>  Place the memory card in the card reader and go to My Computer. <br>   <br>  Open the memory card and you should see a folder on the left (DCIM) that has your picture. Do not open the MISC folder on the right.<br>   <br>  Double Click on the DCIM folder and you should see another folder e.g.,100HPM417, which includes the name of your camera.  Double Click on that folder and you should see the picture you just took.<br>   <br>  When you copy from the computer to a memory card, that is the folder where your pictures must be copied. You may only be able to copy one picture at a time.<br>   <br>  One last thing, the file names of your pictures must not have any additional letters or those pictures will not be seen by the camera.  Also, the file name format must match the file name of the picture you took e.g., HPIM1903.  Rename files to the same format as your camera photos.<br>   <br>  If you have trouble with this, it may be easier to right click on Start and then left click Explore.

AA11725378	The yellow wire in the A/V wires is in fact video. The others are left and right audio. It has been my experience, though, that splitters (or "jumpers") don't always work for video, which is likely the reason the set you have doesn't even have a yellow wire. The way I have things set up at home is with a component box. You can find a cheap one at Target or Wal-Mart for less than $20 with a manual channel select series of buttons.<br>  <br>  Essentially, it has four (or more) A/V inputs with a single output to go to your television. For example, you could plug the the output from your DVD player into the input of channel 1 of the component box, then the Wii into channel 2 with the output of the box leading to your television. Since mine is manual, I physically have to push a button to switch between components, but the more expensive ones read when the power of a device is turned on and switch automatically.<br>  <br>  Of course, if your television has more than one input for A/V wires, you could bypass the whole procedure! Simply plug into the different inputs and select the input on your television accordingly.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bro is correct. I think he even uses the correct terminology by calling the device a "composite video switch", but we are describing the same thing.|`|BMConIedaa	If you don't have enough sets of input jacks on your TV, you should get a Video Switch.  A cheap composite video switch will cost around US$20-$40, and can be found nearly any place video games are sold (Best Buy, GameStop, those sorts of places...).<br>  <br>  My TV only has one set of component jacks, but I have 4 component sources - My Wii, my DVD player, my PC, and my HD broadcast tuner (my HDTV was made before it was mandatory to include a built-in HD tuner).  I use a Component Video Matrix Switch to hook all 4 devices to the same input jack.  It is a 4-in/2-out switch, which means I can hook up a second display, such as a projector, and watch a movie on that while playing a game on my TV, or swap what I'm doing at will.  Matrix switches are a little more expensive than regular switches, but incredibly useful in more complex home theater setups.

While you could download an app like Notefolio to take notes on your calculator, it might just be easier to make a program and store your notes in that.<br>  <br>  Go to [Prgm] > New > 1:Create New... to make a new program. Type in a name, then type your notes in that. If you ever need to look at it again, just go to [Prgm] > Edit > then the program name.

RyvKws7Laa	There is a huge range in different technical specifications among HDTVs.  So the more expensive one likely has some of the more elite features.  Those features right now come with ah heavy price premium and hence the price difference you see.  If the Samsung was more expensive I would figure it was because you're looking at one of its better lines (series) that comes with the higher end features.  If the Sony was more expensive, well that's Sony.  Sony gives you very good quality, and excellent reliability, but more often than not charges more for the same or less features.  <br>  <br>  At 40", don't get too caught up in the most of the marketing.  You need to be in around 42" (maybe) and more often into 50" and higher to notice a lot of the "marketing" features.  Those would be things like 1080p over 720p, 120Hz/240Hz over 60Hz, and various contrast ratio numbers.<br>  <br>  For contrast ratios ignore them.  There is no independent body that determines how it is measured.  So each manufacturer can measure and report what they like for that figure.  So essentially its useless.  And the dynamic contrast ratios are the biggest joke of all (I think they just look to the closest big round number and put that on the box).  I think this is better analyzed by just looking at the TVs in person and going to where your eye gravitates (its your TV, so go with what your eye likes, not what the Internet likes).<br>  <br>  For 1080p vs 720p, you're kind of in the border-ish range.  1080p from a normal viewing distance (6-9ft) might be noticeable at that size.  But its kind of pushing it.  I think more realistically you'll be served just fine with a 720p TV.  Unless you do plan on sitting uncomfortably close the whole time.<br>  <br>  For the refresh rate, again you're kind of in the border-ish range if you're at a normal viewing distance.  I would personally say go with the set that has 120Hz (if either do).  This will help fast motion playback look better on your TV.  But if the $1000 less one still looks really good to you and its only 60Hz, again if you'll be sitting at a normal viewing distance, in reality it just might not be a huge issue for you.  But this is certainly one of the specs that can drive up the price of a TV.<br>  <br>  At 40" I think the best Samsung, bang-for-buck, you'll get is the Samsung LN40A630.  Though the LN40A550 would also be an okay choice and it gives you about the same in picture quality.  The sony at that level of picture quality is the KDL-40XBR7, which I think is overpriced.  I think its a perfectly good TV with excellent picture quality, but that would be $1000 more than the Samsung's of equal picture quality.  And I think the LN40A630 is actually better built in speakers than the Sony (or its own little brother the A550).|`|RMmh0aimaa	Resolution: 1080 is best<br>  Contrast ratio: Higher = Better 50,000:1 is great.<br>  Response rate: Lower is better 2ms is great.<br>  Number of input jacks<br>  Picture in Picture PIP allows you to checkout 1 channel in the corner of the screen while another is playing.|`|sxahupRTaa	Check out the website that I posted below. You have got a lot of research to do my friend.|`|GLBWe3A9aa	One was probably plasma and full hd.<br>  The other was probably your standard flat screen.|`|dqzoEw67aa	There are many, many differences between features and quality of parts in different lcds.  It's like cars, they all run and look pretty good at first, but over time, better parts last longer and more features provide a more pleasing driving (viewing) experience.<br>  <br>  LCDs run from the top of the line Samsung and Sony, to junk like Philips, Westinghouse and others with names I don't even know.  And there are mid tier, Sharp, Toshiba, maybe Vizio on the lower level of tier two.<br>  <br>  The actual screens are different, the quality of the parts, service and warranty, etc.  And within each brand, they go from entry level to top of the line.  Adding features to each level up, like 720 to 1080.  60Hz to 120 Hz.  Etc., etc.  You have to find one you like and research it.<br>  <br>  For best viewing go with a Samsung you can afford or a Sony.
qvnrag48aa	Arpeet, Wii Sports is good, but it comes with the wii already... so you dont need to buy it!<br>  <br>  Anyways, I am a fan of the wii and am always looking for great games too.<br>  <br>  As far as graphics, replay value, and entertainment go.. <br>  I would buy Rock Band 2, Mario Kart Wii, and DEFINATELY Super Smash Bros Brawl. But use IGN.com to see some screenshots and get an idea what each involves.<br>  <br>  Have fun! Ask me if you have any questions bout the games too. Hope this helped!|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	I honestly think those games are boring. Wii Sports is really good if you don't already have it. MarioKart is one of the best games. If you play online, you'll never be able to stop. Wii Fit, I think, was the best selling Wii game for 2008. Wii Sports 2 is coming out in April, which will be great. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is also a really fun game. Don't get Wii Play though. It may come with a free remote, but it's really boring.
RyvKws7Laa	The Samsung LN40A550 is likely going to give you your best bang for the buck.  At the 40" mark, if you can get 1080p and 120Hz offerings in your budget, great.  They certainly won't hurt any.  But if you go with 720p and 60Hz its not likely going to be the end of the world for your viewing experience.  At that size, at a normal viewing distance (6ft+) you're not likely to notice the advantages a whole lot.  <br>  <br>  But if you are going to be sitting close to the TV, you could consider an upgrade in model and look at the LN40A650.  That would give you a bit better picture quality overall (but there is a price jump).  <br>  <br>  Both sets come with your PiP desired setting.<br>  <br>  I don't think going with a Sony Bravia XBR would be a bad option for you picture quality wise.  It will perform well I'm sure.  You can take a look at the Sony Bravia XBR Series KDL-40XBR6.  I think that would be a solid set.  Though I don't see specific reference to PiP.  So maybe its not the set for you.  But if I went 40" Sony, that's the model I would want.|`|UinOWcMUaa	I install TV's everyday... and so I would say Samsung here is why...

Sony.. your more or less paying for the name while Samsung clearly has Aesthetically) speaking a better looking TV with all the bells and whistles as a sony :)<br>  <br>  When it all comes down to it... you will want to consider things such as How many HDMI inputs the TV has, contrast ratio, refresh rate, and energy consumption... and of course which one costs the less.. Usually it is Samsung...|`|ZyR8ezBwaa	Sony TVs are really overpriced, and Samsung TVs are nice, too. I think you should get a Samsung. See if you can find a good deal online, because it will be cheaper than in the stores. If not, you can always wait a while until a really good deal comes. Best Buy and other stores have great sales on holidays. If you're in no hurry, there's Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and if you're really willing to get a good deal, Thanksgiving early bird.|`|RCbtRF4xaa	I bought Sony KDL40S4100 to complement its bigger brother, the Sony KDL52XBR4 HDTV, which resides in the entertainment room. This one was a perfect fit for our bedroom, and as a bedroom set, we didn't need all the bells-and-whistles of an XBR. Sure, it is less technologically advanced and visually impressive than Sony's flagship XBR, but for a second tv (or even the only tv), it will fit most peoples' needs.

If you need to do anything else, the instructions will come with the phone.|`|AA10660547	If  you are "eligible" ( please check ) they will start the activation process.  With Sprint you will most likely call Customer Service ( or receive lengthy instruction) to finish the process.  Sprint has a a few steps before activation is complete.  If you are tech savvy NO problem. If you are not tech savvy you may not want to do it this way.  Also Wirefly is inexpensive SOMETIMES.  Please look around before finalizing.  Most carriers will NOT service phones you bought from Wirefly or a 3rd party ( ebay, wire-fly etc). Do you belong to "Sams Club" ?  Check them out.  Good Luck!

AA10362623	I loved the Beat Goes On when they had a Pryor store. But have never been to the Claremore store.
AA11113224	As much as I love them, I despise them.  I finally got myself to buy an ipod (video) two months ago.  This was after waiting a year and a half of convincing myself not too.  Not only did they drop in price but they come out with new designs.  That's technology for you.<br>  <br>  I actually like the ipod shuffle design.  I think the fact that it clips is very innovative.  Now you don't have you wear that ugly looking lanyard.  I was a bit disappointed in the nano turning into an alien Ipod mini (tall, thin, and fragile looking) but I'm glad they did away with the 1gb.  I didn't think it made sense when they was a cheaper shuffle with the same capacity.  I mean how long does it really take to go through 240 songs? <br>  <br>  Anyway,  before they come up with an Ipod camcorder or touch screen I hope that Apple can come up with a solution to the 4-6 hour battery life when watching tv shows/movies on your ipod video.|`|AA11056852	I love them, you don't seem to be happy.|`|AA11251656	uhh i still think that there mediocore players. uhh if people want to have a quality prodcut thats worth all that money creativ eis the wayto go. especiially the zen viison m.|`|AA11921492	I am SUPER happy that they came out with a nano with a 2000 song capicity!

W7VzoMZkaa	I can't help u with the USB swivel, but i can warn u not to waste ur time. I bought the KP1000 1GB audiophase mp3 player two weeks ago. my USB swivel worked fine, but when I tried to add songs to it, it only played 40 of 100 or so songs that I put on it. I tried it again and it only played 13. Then it froze on me and said I had no files on it. I returned it and got another one thinking I bought a defective mp3 player, but that one did the same thing. I bought it from Kmart and the salesperson told me that two more people returned theirs too with the same problem. She also said that one of the customers called the customer service number on the package and they said the chip in the mp3 player  was too small and wouldn't hold as many songs as it should. So if u have ur receipt, and it's not too late, return it and get another mp3 player. San disk works pretty good, and I got another audiophase mp3 player (it's a newer model, and it stores pictures, video, voice recording, mp3 and wav music, and has a FM radio to it and you can record songs played on the radio stations) and it's working pretty good so far.

This camcorder don't use iLink (Firewire), it uses USB 2.0 and HDMI. As for shooting in dark conditions this baby have manual controls for white balance, exposure, sharpness, shutter priority, aperture priority and brightness control.<br>  <br>  My final opinion about this camcorder? I want one!!!!|`|N1CIndMOaa	Your correct about having an external mic feature. Also look for reviews of cameras that handle low light well. I'm guessing some of your shots will be in mixed and/or low lighting. An add-on light will help.<br>  <br>  Look for a camera that uses FireWire connectability. It works better for live capture and downloading your video recording to your computer. <br>  <br>  You will be very impressed by the quality of HD. But be aware that you'll need a souped up computer to handle AVCHD. Whatever software you choose to edit with, add more to the system resources than the manufacture recommends.

AA10142060	I used to work for Verizon for many years.  First a question, did you pay your "deposit" to a Verizon Wireless store or was it a reseller (authorized representative) who sold several different carriers?  If it was from a reseller, they probably told you that there was a deposit when there wasnt one required by Verizon and they just kept your money.  Pretty shady, but it has happened alot! If it was purchased from Verizon direct start raising hell, and tell them that you are going to report them to the FCC and they will work with you. I hope this helps, GOOD LUCK!|`|47d244d62e953f06f3f23fd44440a3bcaa	Ouchh. Well this is a BIG deal i could imagine how much that would have cost! I would just tell them that you did pay and  your willing to take leagal action ( just to scare them a little )

D8BDhIGwaa	Both are using the HDMI for video OUT, you need one to work as video IN (like an HDTV which uses HDMI for video IN).<br>  <br>  Your HP uses HDMI to output into a HDTV etc., check your manual and see if it accepts video IN from the HDMI.  I'm guessing it doesn't.<br>  <br>  RTFM.
mKReqC7waa	Maybe its because you set the internet up and even thou it wont let you connect, its still acknowledging that you have some sort of internet setup. I would recommend that you either A) move closer to the access point <br>  B) make sure laptops or other wireless devices arent interrupting the signal  C) get a new router or D) Try using a wired connection. If none of those work, try changing your computers settings.<br>  In my situation, i had to lead a wire from the router in my 1st floor to my wii which was in my basement.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|SmWoRu3kaa	It could be connecting to an unrelated access point near you, but the access point is denying it any internet access.|`|S8AXB3JRaa	re enter the router code that happened to mii too.

mQEDPQ3aaa	Spore creature creator is only a small slice of Spore, yes you can customize things on spore just like creature creator, if you want spore just buy it but, i personally haven't had the best experience with it as its a rushed game and does not live up its expectations. in all honesty i think the sims 3 will be a better game than spore.from what i've seen so far spore is only interesting to my 8 year old cousin and he has only ever played the creating stage, so if you do want it that badly just get the creature creator, it saves you quite a bit of money and by the way, spore is a FAIL.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/218-Spore" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/v...</a>|`|3OrZQBMxaa	Creature creator (and more - building, vehicle and spacecraft creator) is included with the regular Spore. Happy sporing!<br>  <br>  Edit: John has a good point. The game is OK, but not something you'll come back to again and again. It's your decision at the end of the day though.
YveHrC8Laa	Yes, it is possible. The only problem is, the keyboard is kinda small, because the n64 controller has quite alot of buttons on it (like the c-buttons). But don't worry, my brother and I played old school co-op games on one keyboard before, and it was fun :)<br>  <br>  To set the options, go to the controller configuration option, then select the player 2 tab, and make sure you assign keys that player 1 is not using.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

Also the nano is much more pocket/travel friendly.

AA11113224	No, you have to buy them separately.  One that works for practically all MP3 players (or even CD players) is the cassette adapter.  If you have a cassette player you just plug it into the headphone jack.  Only downside is that the adapter doesn't charge your ipod.<br>  <br>  If you only have a radio you'll have to get an FM transmitter.  I don't know if other MP3 players have them buy there are a lot of FM transmitters for ipods (the ones with dock connectors anyway).  You can buy FM transmitters with or without charging capabilities.  They range from $30-$50 without being able to charge or $75 - $90.  My cousin uses the Monster cable ($90) and I use a Maxwell cassette adapter ($20).  The downside with the FM transmitters is that you sometimes lose reception if you go under tunnels and such.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

01SVwSOoaa	the Sansa has two modes wherein it may connect to the computer, the MSC (Mass Storage Class) mode and the MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) mode.  If you are transferring un-licensed, non-protected songs, you may transfer them using the MSC mode by simply copying them on to the Sansa.  This mode also allows you to use the player with Audible files.  If you are transferring music that you have purchased or music that are licensed and/or proctected, you would need to use the MTP mode.  To transfer these files, you would need to use Windows Media Player 10 or some other Music Softwares such as Rhapsody and Napster.  <br>  <br>  If you add songs to the player in one mode, then switch to the other mode, you will not be able to see the songs from the previous mode, though the space used on the player will still reflect their presence.  If you cannot see your songs on your PC in one mode, please try viewing them in the other.  In order to change the USB mode of the player, you must power the player on and go to "Settings."  Under "Settings," there should be a "USB" option.  It would then give you the choice to change it from "Auto Detect" (MTP which is also known as Playforsure in other Sansa) to "MSC (Also known as Rhapsody in other Sansa)."  <br>  <br>  To add songs using the MSC mode, follow these steps:<br>  <br>  1.  Organize your songs into folders and place it into one directory.<br>  2.  Open "My Computer" and open the "Sansa C240" drive for your Sansa.<br>  3.  If you see 3-4 Folder there, click on Tools choose File Opdtion, there will be a Pop-up screen and choose View Tab<br>  4.  Select on Show Hidden files and Folder Option, so you can see all the files<br>  5.  Choose MUSIC Folder, double click and Drag and drop all the songs on that folder, and It will go automatically on your player.

International calls of course have country codes that identify which country to route the call to and you must dial 011 first to access another country from the US. The 1 dialed on long distance calls in the US is actually the country code. The first three digits that most call area codes are actually called NPA's, or numbering plan areas. They determine a certain geographic area. The next three digits are the central office code, or NXX that is assigned to a states (or city/province) local service provider. The next four digits are the line number at the switch level (which is local). Each NPA, NXX, and line number can tell you who the provider is. What you do not see is the identifying numbers such as the CIC, or Carrier ID Code which is used to route and bill the calls. Each CIC is owned by a certain company and is one of the things that is used when billing. We won't get into wire centers, trunks, and switches as that will only cause more confusion.<br>  <br>  In India they are moving to go to ten digit dialing as well. Even now, the same things apply to India. The first digits are still a NPA/area code, the next are your Central office code, and so on as I explained above. Telecommunication systems are essentially the same there are just different billing structures and systems in place within various countries. Calls still need to be routed from one place to another. The call has an originating and terminating point that passes through switches, towers (cell phones), and wire centers no matter where you live.
