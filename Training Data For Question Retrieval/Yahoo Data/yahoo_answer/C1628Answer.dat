SFjkt8VZaa	There is an island called Culebra and Puerto Rico owns it. You are going to love it !!! Flamenco beach is my fav. The people are really nice and the beaches are amazing. If you want to see pure turquoise water and white sand, you need to go there. You have to take a small plane from San Juan and I think it's $25.00 (15 min ride) each way or you can take a boat $4.00 (2 hr ride) However, the boat leave from Fajardo and that's on the west side of the island. I recommend the plane to Culebra, the views are Amazing and the ride is really fast. I hope this helps.|`|Fu7E340yaa	There are lots of clear water beaches... Flamenco Beach in Culebra, Giligan's Island, and there are many more...<br>  <br>  You should try calling Venture Out Puerto Rico.

On the beach and shopping every day.  Nights were mini golf (they have great mini golf) and dinner theatre (Dolly Partons Dixi Stampede).  We went down on the main strip at least every other day (Ripley's Believe it or Not, Guinness Records, Wax museums etc...) Loads of fun for a whole family.

fM7CwTwzaa	The tourist permits may be good for 180 days, but all you have to do is stroll across the border into Guatemala or Belize for a day or two, then re-enter Mexico and get yourself a new 180-day tourist permit. No fuss, no muss --- plus you get a nice weekend getaway laying out on the cays of Belize or touring the Mayan sites of Guatemala. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, it's not true that police don't enforce the laws. If you try working when you don't have a work permit, chances are excellent that a pissed off Mexican employee, whose job you're stealing, will rat you out. Happens to gringos all the time. Then you just might find yourself deported back to the U.S.<br>  <br>  If you have enough cash or an under-the-radar income source, you could probably disappear in Mexico for just about forever.<br>  <br>  Andrew Luster, the infamous Max Factor rapist, thought so anyway. But then Dog the Bounty Hunter found Luster on the beaches of Puerto Vallarta, kidnapped him, and brought him back to the U.S. to collect his reward.

i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  The relationship is that they are the only people to negotiate peace with and that sucks because these people aren't peaceful at all. The PLO was the main negotiating body in behalf of the Palestinian people until the Jan 2006 elections and the Fatah has always been a subset of the PLO but they renamed it the PA. The elections showed only two major candidate groups as the other groups only got a few seats. <br>  <br>  Hamas led by Khaled Meshal out of Damascus with a local leader Ismail Haniyeh and Fatah led by Abu Mazen (Abbas.)  Abbas ended up getting the Presidency in earlier election with Haniyeh of Hamas as PM in the later elections.  When the Palestinians elected overwhelmingly  the terrorist group that is when things started changing for them. The West started isolating them and instilled monetary sanctions so as to not fund terrorism.<br>  <br>  Things changed further once the Hamas militants took over Gaza by force June 2007, then the PLO (Fatah) President exercised their political option, called state of emergency and appointed a new PM, Salaam Fayyad. That is also when the West reacted against the arms smuggling and enforced a strong blockade.<br>  <br>  Since the elections and the Gaza June 2007 upheaval the two groups have been murdering, incarcerating and torturing each other with occasional smaller groups participating in the frays. If any of these leaders walked into the other's "territory" they would have their throats slit from ear to ear as they both made statements to assassinate each other.<br>  <br>  The terrorists keep changing their name but Fatah was part of PLO, who was responsible for the Black September Jordan battles where they tried to assassinate King Hussein and and the murder of the Munich athletes 1972. Arafat then made his way to Lebanon and caused civil war there when he made his "road to palestine leads thru Jonieh" statements. This is all at the behest of Syria. Hamas is a new offshoot of Palestinian extremism when Fatah became more moderate and they are also based out of Syria.<br>  <br>  There is nobody else to negotiate a peace deal with except these two terrorist groups.  Hamas is the worst of the worst, and while people keep trying to make peace deals with Abbas of Fatah, in reality he is no different than Hamas, but just looks moderate compared to Hamas, who is way off the terrorist charts so much that one of the sons of a Hamas leader converted to Christianity and is now living a happy life in America.<br>  <br>  None of these two groups are representative of the people (or are they?) at least in a peaceful way. The Palestinians never had a peaceful leader to negotiate on their behalf because the moment there comes a peaceful person they threaten to decapitate him. While they continually plan violence, no western person can negotiate with them, nor should be expected to.  It is just there is nobody else to talk peace with but people still demand a try, which is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  And my personal suggestion is that I don't see why anyone is trying anyways because this is just a fake political group invented by Syria to make a trojan horse to attack Israel from within.  Just make Israel a theocracy she is entitled to that and absorb these people under Israeli sovereignty.  Nobody looks at this option because the secularists are afraid of themselves and have a religious identity crisis.  Thankfully things are turning more to the right where people will accept this option.  It's the peaceful solution where actually Justice is served and nobody is left out in the cold.  They can be successfully absorbed and govern themselves and Israel be in charge of security so that they cannot arm themselves to cause further damage to themselves or another.|`|Fb519XJgaa	The Israeli killed both Rabin and Arafat and nothing happened since.|`|mXCDJ9jYaa	The Zionists are playing for time; that's why these "negotiations" lead nowhere. The PLO is recognized by the UN as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people; I'm not sure I support that since it is Fatah-dominated and I think leadership belongs with the Popular Front. As to any "relationship" there really isn't one,except that the izzies are becoming adept at manipulating the U.S. into forcing the P.A./PLO to serve as a kind of Vichy or Quisling pseudo- government. I support Hamas as the only realistic alternative; the objection in izziland is that Hamas doesn't "recognize" the zionist regime - but recognition is generally between states,not between a state and a party and in any event it is virtually always reciprocal - always. And I can't imagine any zionists squawking for recognition of Hamas. No matter what. As things stand,the US/israeli goverment is merely exploiting the PLO the way Hitler exploited Marshall Petain in 1940-44.|`|8cWXhZGjaa	The relationship between Israel and the PLO is vey complex, basically they are not friends but they are willing to negotiate with them in hopes of obtaining peace in a two-state solution.|`|5720a35acb05fbf04a17f74f66750115aa	Good question, this confirms that the dominance is the denominator between Nazism and Zionism

UIJorsD7aa	Conversion is definitely a huge step.  An Orthodox conversion takes a couple of years, as you will have to attend classes which will cover all aspect of Judaism.<br>  Once you have converted, you will be regarded as 100% Jewish.<br>  In my Orthodox community there are quite a few converts, and they have all been warmly embraced!<br>  Good luck to you!  Feel free to email me with any questions:)|`|Ic8FLXm5aa	You need to convert to Judaism only if you desire to be a daughter of Israel, not simply for marriage. You really need to believe there is one god and that god is hashem. You will need to be ultra orthodox or at least observe the religion the same way as the orthodox jewish man. According to the torah a convert is more of a jew than an ethnic Jew.<br>  <br>  By Jewish law your children will be Jewish if you convert to Judaism. Once you convert you are Jewish that is it. And if your children are not religious they are still Jewish.|`|iraiRVT1aa	my sister is Orthodox and she married a man who came from a mixed background that formally converted to Orthodox Judaism, there are no problems in our family with it|`|5oSnj1eTaa	My dear friend, there is a solution to both of you.<br>  It's there right in front of your very eyes.<br>  If the interest is mutual, I suggest to try and live the first year of your love without promising any commitment to eachother.<br>  But live together,just like a married couple.<br>  If things work out fine, then I am afraid there is only one honest solution to your problem.<br>  You will have to "meet" half-way.<br>  There are quiet a few religious solutions available for you, just do a study, ask people and you both convert to that religion.<br>  Don't worry though, God is one. God is the same for all of us.<br>  By doing it this way, you are going to start a new life from scratch on equal terms.<br>  Anything else will bring a sudden end to your marriage pretty soon, and the sad thing will be that neither of you really wanted this to happen.<br>  Trust me I have been using this method for more than twenty years (21 actually) and I did not regret not even once.<br>  Greetings|`|YSXDTs3Eaa	The only difficulty you might have is that if you are lax in observing Orthodox custom, it would be frowned on if your future spouse is to remain in the "Orthodox Community". Being Orthodox is a burden EVEN FOR JEWS! I suggest that you and he reach an understanding as to where he stands as regards external appearances and what goes on in your home; conversely, we were more Orthodox at home than outside simply because we did not have to appear Orthodox outside the home. It depends on whether his parents have always been Orthodox and how Orthodox. Even my cousin who is a rabbinic judge does not subscribe to what I'll call "fanaticism," and some of the most leaned Talmudic scholars are not Orthodox! In Israel we don't have to be Orthodox because we already live in a Jewish society, so we are not that concerned about assimilation. If you have a real understanding of Judaism, you already know what I mean, and besides--love is stronger than Orthodox belief--it's the person rather than belief that counts! Watch how many points get deducted for my answer. As to being born non-Jewish, read the Story of Ruth. You will be respected and made to feel at home. Welcome!|`|e3685f49608aafc5826d78a4417c8ab8aa	Orthodox Jews see non-Jews as, well, non-Jews. That's it. An Orthodox man who has fallen in love with you might feel more than a bit conflicted and quite unsure about his connection to his religion. he has to choose what he wants out of life and how he wants to view himself within his culture. If you wanted to be together, he either has to foresake his beliefs, or you would have to convert, but Orthodoxy would not accept conversion for the sake of marriage so you'd have to break up, you convert over a span of 2 or so years, then get back together, both of you having grown and changed over time. Until that happens, the children would not be Jewish. Children born after proper conversion by a woman are 100% Jewish as is the woman.|`|d117226cff9e65399c2226c82fd237a5aa	Believing in God is something that does not submit to human variables.<br>  If you believe in a God you will obay him completely,<br>  Gods do not come tailor-made nor can they be modified according to the worshipper's fancy.<br>  If you do believe then stick with your beliefe otherwise, it does not matter what you do.|`|B7hnlwW6aa	Daniel is a liar. I know many orthodox Jews and they do not think that I am a pig. <br>  As far as your children, by Jewish law they would not be Jewish. <br>  Go to simpletoremember.com and look up intermarriage. Over 75% of such marriages fail within 3 years.|`|0StmErZBaa	How orthodox can he be if he is willing to marry a convert?|`|fj5nfuZTaa	Conversion MUST be done for the right reason, but you seem to understand that. Judaism in general discourages people from conversion. However, this does not apply to people who have Jewish father and aspesially were raised with some knowledge of Judaism. Such people are considered members of extended Jewish family but not Jews per se. So ifyou deside to go through conversion you should have a bit easier time. Also once you convert you are completely Jewish all converts are accepted by Jews fine. In fact we are forbiden to mention that such person is a convert. (In practice itdoes come up anyway but it is never viewed negatively). Coverts are presived very positevely.|`|zpvOGzT6aa	Lots of good answers.  Just want to clarify one more point.  Judaism does not require a person to be Jewish in order to reach spiritual heights.  A non jew can go to heaven if they are a moral person who believes in one G-d.  That is why Jews don't missionize and even discourage conversion.  <br>  Orthodox Judaism believes in following the Torah very strictly.  It is not easy.  As soon as a person converts, they are just as Jewish as a born Jew and therefore just as obligated in the Mitzvot.  This is why the conversion process takes so long.  You gotta be ready to be an orthodox Jew before you become one.  One of the Mitzvot is to love a convert and not make them uncomfortable.  We are forbidden to mention that this person was not always Jewish.  Any convert is as much a jew as I am.

pI5jKfmaaa	Gandhi's understanding of religion and Indian culture was the key to understanding his public life. While his religion was grounded in the Hindu beliefs he had been taught as a child, Gandhi fashioned for himself a humanist religious philosophy on which he based his theory of nonviolence as a political method as well as his economic theories. Gandhi was eclectic in seeking and using insights from other religions, especially Christian pacifism. He rejected the assertion that the Christian gospel was the necessary path for all humankind to follow. Gandhi's mixed attitude toward Islam had more direct political consequence. He rejected Islamic claims of universal validity, but political realities led him in the 1920s to support the anti-British Khilafat movement, which was based on an appeal that Islam was in danger because of the British role in overthrowing the Ottoman Empire. Some historians argue that there were unintended consequences in his support for this pan-Islamic movement, because it brought religion into politics in a highly divisive way, leading to Partition of Pakistan as a separate nation in 1947. Nanda (2002) argues that Gandhi and the Indian National Congress did not see that their vision of nationhood was not shared by the Muslim leadership. Two incopatible nationalisms were contending for living space in the same territory.|`|XrEqv6K9aa	The bitter truth is that Gandhiji miserably failed to unify Hindus & Muslims. For reasons best known to him he always discarded Hindus and appeased  Muslims. He said differently but a deep analysis would show that Pakistan creation was because of his policy of this sort of appeasement. His efforts left India in a in between and hanging situation and we re suffering still because of that.

If they have already prepaid the room and their name is on the reservation then you are technically just a guest, make sure they add your name to the guest ledger so you can check into the hotel though.(a side note: if the person prepaying the room is over 21 the hotel won't know anyways. They would have to see the ID to verify age and if that person will not be there they can't know that so its kinda pointless.) <br>  <br>  They will still ask for an ID to verify your name is on the reservation and probably ask for an additional CC to guarantee incidentals however most hotels will allow you into the hotel if your over 18.

V6aH1vpQaa	I have good news, and bad news.  The good news is that Boston has a fantastic public transportation system, so you can live sorta far away from school and still take the "T" there.  The bad news is that even if you live sorta far away from school, apartments are going to be expensive.  You could probably get a studio for $700 a month, which sounds insane to people in the south or midwest, but probably sounds great to someone from NY.  Also, check into possible university subsidized housing.  Google "MTBA stops" for a map of the T.
ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	The biggest expense here is housing. If you are an au pair, that should take care of your housing. A good au pair position might also include access to a car, which is a requirement here in LA. <br>  <br>  Check out my answers to other questions in this forum about what it's like to live in LA. It's too long to put into this question.<br>  <br>  Au pair positions are generally on the west side of LA, and in the San Fernando Valley. In other words, people who hire au pairs live in very nice neighborhoods. I really don't need to give you a rundown of the thousands of neighborhoods here. If someone is looking for an au pair, it's a given that it's in a nice place.<br>  <br>  Social life is all up to you. You can just hole up in your home, or make an effort to get out and see and meet people.<br>  <br>  Once you get your visa straghtened, we always advise about $7500US for Americans, and about $10,000 minimum if you are coming from abroad. <br>  <br>  One thing, however: With the economy in the toilet, EVERYBODY is cutting back, even wealthy people. Such positions are harder to come by. You might want to register with a "nanny" service here. "Super Nanny" is a big show here now, so people are open to the idea. However, people are cutting back for now.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	As a citizen of the U.K. your first task is to find an agency in London that can match you up with a family in the U.S that will sponsor you. To legally work here you will need the proper visa, and the agency could help you to obtain that also . I believe it is the H1B visa, but I'm mot certain.
ZqXUduJMaa	It's fine. Many hotels in Europe have shared baths. The people in the other room are staying at the hotel - I'm sure they are not there just to steal from the adjoining room. They had to leave their credit card and probably driver's license info at the front desk.|`|nANyAvzgaa	Invite your neighbour next door for a drink and/or coffee and get acquainted with him/her; that way you will get an idea what kind of a person is going to share bathroom with you.

Lock the doors when you are in the room, and make sure your own door is always locked. If you have any valuables or something you are concerned about having stolen, put it in the safe in the room. If there is no safe in the room, put your things in a small bag and ask the hotel front desk to put it in their safe when you are out of your room.|`|hrBVwQxTaa	well, lets just hope you don't get someone to get the room next to you.<br>  and if they do, and your worried they might go in, put your valuables in a place they most likely wouldn't look, and maybe you can request for some lock to lock from the inside of the room.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Don't worry about that.

5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	Yes there are such ticket. I remember i used to issue tickets with the endorsement saying 'non-endorse/reroute/refund/valid on flight/date shown only'. So of the 2 scenarios:-<br>  <br>  1) You just have to purchase a new ticket and waste the current ticket. Or you can upgrade(terms and conditions apply), subject to availability. If they allow you to upgrade, that means you pay a bit more and they reissue you a new ticket.<br>  <br>  2)If the delay or cancellation of flight is not the fault of the passenger, then the airline will make arrangement for the traveler on another flight. This can only happen if the delay or cancellation is caused by unforeseen circumstances like bad weather, plane engine broke down etc. Passenger should be demanding in such situation as some airlines really cant be bothered with customer service and let the travelers suffer.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Southwest Airlines lets you change your travel dates for a nominal fee, and they have no cancellation fee.  You can just use what you paid for the flight towards another flight.

bnSLRVUMaa	When i was little,i moved to a whole new school in a whole new district. to me, it was like i had entered a whole new planet. i was very shy, so ya, it was hard for me. but i had to learn to branch out and talk to new people. that's what you need to do... try hanging out at little coffee shops, book stores, anywhere with interesting people. don't be afraid to be yourself, that's what you truly need. so while your still at your new town, practice making small talk with random people, that will prepare you for your move. Good Luck!|`|ZzKGxoYqaa	I guess it depends on were you move to,  I worked with someone that moved from Florida to here in Massachusetts and said that it was hard to meet new people because they weren't as friendly as people in Florida even at work.|`|xh0Pagv3aa	anti-social, problem   - people person,    no problem pick one and you'll be happy with your direction. sometimes a new social circle and starting over can bring out a brand new you one that you never knew of|`|x9snNxZmaa	I've lived in North Dakota, Nebraska, Arizona, and Missouri.

They have all the amenities of a decent resort.  Whatever hotel you choose, be sure to visit Rick's Cafe for the beautiful sunsets.
Z6tqdAoGaa	I must have answered this question 50 times in the past.Upgrades are only given if economy has been overbooked,and the upgrade will be given to those who hold frequent flyer cards.As it is your honeymoon,I would be delighted to give you an upgrade,but we have to have a valid reason,and going on your honeymoon is not a good enough reason.The best I can suggest is that you write to the airline's customer services and let them know,as it will be them who authorise the upgrage if possible.Even if they don't give an authorisation,they will put a note in your booking and you will be well looked after on the flight.|`|AA11103493	You can but try, you could be lucky on the day. If you want to try though, you need to be dressed for it.  They're more likely to upgrade you if you're wearing smart clothes.|`|dmT4LFIIaa	Ok, Firstly don't ask at the airline check-in desk, it rarely works that way. Secondly dress appropriately for say Business Class travel, ie no jeans,trainers t-shirts etc and opt for "smart casual". Once through at your departure gate you could ask the gate staff "if there are any seats un-occupied with extra legroom, we are on honeymoon and would apprecaite the extra room", be polite and act a little shy about it, NEVER say upgrade as it usually fails!!!|`|AA11928895	It never hurts to try, but don't be too pushy about it - mention it if you want, see what comes of it - but I wouldn't come out and ask for an upgrade outright.|`|hLQa3VtYaa	Usually what happens is, If they dont fill first class they will upgrade ppl for $50 or so... a lot cheaper but still not free......

2HETgiwgaa	Basing yourself in Queenstown is a great idea.  That way you can go on one or two-day trips to places like Fiordland (I've heard Doubtful Sound is the one to visit - though Milford is probably more commonly talked about) and the West Coast  (Wildfood Festival in Hokitika  - I think March 14 this year).  If you're in Kaikoura, you have to check out the Whale Watching.  In Christchurch, there's the Antarctic Centre - right by the airport and complete with penguins and a room that simulates what it feels like to be in a storm in the Antarctic - and you could also explore Bank's Peninsula (Akaroa, etc) if you have the time.<br>  <br>  If you have your own transport, eg rental car, you can plan some of your trip before you get there.  I'd recommend AA Travel for that sort of planning (won't cost you anything to access the info on the site) - and check out the Road Trips, 101 Must-Do's for Kiwis and 101 Kiwi Secrets.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Chch: eat at either The Mexican Cafe, or Dux de Lux.

AA11544445	where are you from? the eu, us, elsewhere? you'll probably want at least €1000 (a little less than $1500 USD) if not more to make sure you won't run out of money (it's happened to me--not fun at all. I came back to the states with €0.09 from €400!)<br>  <br>  You could try hostels some nights, since they're relatively cheap, but if you have the camping supplies and whatnot and aren't afraid of bad weather then you could definitely make it camping, and it would probably be much cheaper.<br>  <br>  If you *really* wanted to scrimp and save, you could probably stretch 500 euro to cover food and drink. How many people are going with you? cook your own food and don't eat out a lot. Also, you might buy stuff at the music festival, so plan for that!<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Belize is my favorite port of call but I really do recommend doing a shore excursion.  The dock is a very small mall filled primarily with a Tanzanite International and a few tequila/tshirt shops.<br>  <br>  The taxis are in mass more so than any other port and I'm not entirely sure how safe they are.  So many people screaming at you if you want a ride somewhere (instead of a Taxi line like Vegas, Cozumel and many other places) just seems...scary.<br>  <br>  The problem is you'd have to take a taxi to the water taxi and a water taxi to the island.  As you've already tendered into Belize, I worry you may use up all of your time in Belize just traveling back and forth to the island.  If you are a scuba diver, that's a great area to explore the limestone caves.  But if not a scuba I'm not sure what you'd find to do there.<br>  <br>  Belize has some of the best shore excursions of any place.  My favorite was cave tubing with <a href="http://www.cave-tubing.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cave-tubing.com</a>  I absolutely love it.  We did 2 caves which is twice what the cruise ship excursion did for half the price.  The guy who runs it (Yanni I think) carefully tracks that to keep it exactly half the price.  After we did the first cave, which was gorgeous and the entrance was mystical like something from a movie, we ran into the cruise ship group.<br>  <br>  My first trip to Belize we took a shore excursion to Xunantunich.  It's the best Mayan ruins and you could actually climb up the stairs.  Many of the Mayan ruins you have to look at from behind the "ropes" so to speak and can't touch or climb up them.  We took the stairs to the top and could see 3 countries.  I was terrified when I saw how high it was but that's just me and my fear of heights.  Air conditioned coach bus out close to 2 hrs to the ruins so you can only do that if you are there a long time but definitely worth the cruise ship price since there is no way you could do that on your own.<br>  <br>  Those are the 2 shore excursions I highly highly recommend and of course if you are a scuba diver Belize is known for that.  So it's probably worth it too if for nothing else than having someone take you to the right place, watch your time and guarantee the ship won't leave you.  <br>  <br>  But like the other poster said, that region is very very poor and definitely Honduras and Belize are two places I wouldn't just "walk around" like I do at Cozumel and St Thomas.  It's just so poor and so little to see right at the port that you'd probably have a miserable time.  With taking a taxi to the water taxi, I'd be worried about getting a taxi to take me back to the port and be on time for my tender.  Water taxis are slow and often take longer than you expect.|`|AA11134471	Belize isnt a place you want to go wandering off. The main tourist areas are about the only places you would want to go, as the rest is very poor and not very safe. I did go on a tour of the Mayan ruins though, by just going a shore an booking myself, It was cheaper and closer than the one the cruise ship offered. It was actually run by a man and wife that are from New York, and spend the winter down there. I also did a snorkel and beach trip that was really nice (if you are into snorkeling).  The second biggest reef in the world is off the coast of Belize (and surrounding countries).|`|nA0744asaa	well I've gone two times. The first time we went on a Caye tour to snorkel in the reef, it was good but not so amazing like the snorkel done in Cozumel.<br>  The second time that we went we did the cave tubing and we did it independently ($40) and it was great. I like it a lot.<br>  Hope you'll  enjoy it!!!

irljnVkAaa	Everyone has an accent, its just you don't notice the accents of people who sound like you. We say that Americans have accents, you say we have accents, an Australian would say we both had accents. Plus there are hundreds of accents in Britain, not just one as I'm sure is the case in your country.|`|P4SgSnVlaa	Well 'British' isn't an accent, it's a nationality (also 'Britain' isn't a country, it's just the name of the island). The UK has many different dialects and accents, as does the USA (I'm assuming that's where you're from?). You may not be able to recognise as easily the different accents in a different country, but they're there. Myself I can't tell the difference between French accents, but there are dozens! <br>  <br>  We all have accents. Usually we consider an accent the way someone sounds different and since we listen to our own voice each day, it's considered the whole 'norm' of a way of speaking, therefore everyone else has an 'accent'. <br>  <br>  To everyone else in the world, you have an accent.|`|8db0578320f91700d4ffe30d808f456eaa	Of course , an "accent" is just when someone pronounces vowel sounds and certain consonants in a way that is different than you are accustomed to hearing them sound so it sounds odd and different to you. If you grow up in a certain region you are used to hearing the words pronounced a certain way and this sounds normal to you but to people outside of that region it may sound strange. There are many regional dialects in Canada and the US. I live on the prairies in Canada and I think people in New York or Boston or from the far south like Florida  sound funny when I hear them on TV. Even people in other regions of Canada sound funny to me like there is a distinctive maritime accent and definitely a different sound from people in Quebec. If you could hear my voice you might think I had an accent but I sound normal to me! Glad you learned something new today!|`|GjsLzmNAaa	I know I have an accent but if I leave my city then I think that other British people have accents..|`|ufFBELTRaa	according to everyone, every language that's spoken, that's foreign, has a accent. it's that simple. so yes, the british people do think we have an accent|`|922cb07c878645ec88a8dcbf9b14f337aa	We southerners think yankees have an accent; do yankees think southerners have an accent?|`|cYElnuFeaa	Yes!

tQsxsuNPaa	Flamenco. When most people think of traditional Spanish dress, they think of Flamenco, or what is called there: "Un vestido Gitano" or "Un Traje de Feria".  The men's clothing is covered better in the latter term, and is more of an Andaluz cowboy suit.  Women sometimes wear a similar outfit:  black suit with some embroidery, bolero style jacket and a flat-topped hat with a flat brim.  <br>  <br>  That's what most people THINK of as traditionally Spanish...Actually, it is the typical dress of Andalucía, and every Región has their own typical folk dress.  Asturias' looks more like a German outfit, and Galicia is reminiscent of Ireland.  <br>  <br>  If you want to look that up, I'm sure, look up "flamenco clothing" "flamenco costume" or traditional Spanish folk dress.<br>  <br>  They actually ran a set of stamps with men and women in all 17 outfits in Spain sometime back.  I almost bought a set while I was there.|`|wP63CsYCaa	It goes by area instead of whole country.

From Sylmar it will take you a while to get to Santa Monica I am assuming you mean the beach of course. I myself have never been on a public bus, but I have seen them on the road. If your making just a one day trip, I would call a cab.|`|ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	Is there any reason you can't go where the answers are? We already told you where the answers are. Are your fingers broken? Are you just too dumb to use the web site?<br>  <br>  If you stay in Sylmar, it will take 3+ hours to get to Santa Monica College via bus. It's only 2 hours by train and bus. It's cheaper by bus only (about $4 vs. $8 by train and bus), but how much is your time worth?<br>  <br>  If you stay downtown LA, it's about 90 minutes.
5DnHABmPaa	You can change the dates of your travel on any airline...for a fee.  The only airline that will not charge you for changing the date is Southwest.  The smaller airlines only charge $50 to $100; the large airlines will charge $150 or more.  You will also often have to pay the difference in the price for a new fare.  For example, if your original ticket was $200 and the price of your new flight is now $450, you will have to pay the $250 difference, plus the change fee.<br>  <br>  In other words, it is very expensive to change your plans.<br>  <br>  Also, airlines are not responsible for "acts of God," meaning anything weather-related.  They are only responsible if it is their fault, such as a plane malfunction.  However, if you are at the airport and your incoming plane is severely delayed, you still may be able to get onto a different flight (without paying all the fees).  Just ask the gate attendant.

94b8KImYaa	The price is per person - if 2 people are in the cabin. <br>  Since if you would be alone in the cabin you would be paying more than the $ 4,799 for yourself. <br>  So one room with 2 people would be for $ 9,598.00<br>  total for 4 people - US$ 19,196.00<br>  <br>  My understanding of cruise only is: without the air package to get to the ship/get back home from where the cruise ends.<br>  <br>  In your case the cost of the cruise only (without flights to and from the port of embarkation/disembarkation) and without any transfers to and from the ship in the port of embarkation/disembarkation is US$ 4,799 per person.|`|N8wNmQShaa	It means that the room you were looking at on average holds a certain amount of people, (say 2) so it will cost 4,799 per 2 people.

Again if you weren't so lazy you could find the information yourself like I did online.<br>  <br>  Q. Where is the closest airport?<br>  A. The nearest commercial airport with scheduled service is Reno International, 127 miles away. Many participants also fly from the Bay Area (San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose are about 350 miles from the event). Keep in mind that you will be flying on Labor Day weekend, and flights fill up quickly and are often expensive. General aviation aircraft may land on the playa at the temporary Black Rock Airport which is adjacent to the event.

AA10863966	If you are RV ing why not do the Denali Highway, not really as many people on that road as you might think (I guess the dirt and distance keeps them away) McClaren lodge has great food and would be a nice shower break part way through, and Paxson lodge has plug ins and showers. The area is insanely beautiful, I like to say it has all the nature and none of the red tape of Denali.<br>  <br>  North of Fairbanks the White Mountains are amazing!

Hardly any traffic.<br>  <br>  Closer to you: <br>  There are great areas around Glennallen, I would call down to the Wolverine Lodge and talk to the owner, he knows all about the area. Plus if you are winter camping he knows all the trails in the area and helps with the grooming.<br>  And the Tetlin National Refuge near Tok is also very nice, they have campgrounds and backcountry camping.<br>  <a href="http://tetlin.fws.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://tetlin.fws.gov/</a>|`|utOVoGo3aa	Find the most vacant place, you might have to drive and walk.

Keep it on a leash to protect it from porcupines, traps, and other hazards. Loose dogs aren't allowed in campgrounds.<br>  Have you been down to the Kenai Peninsula--such as Seward and Homer? Kenai Lake is fun, too. <br>  I agree that the Denali Highway is a great trip. <br>  Talkeetna is a nice place to visit, and people like to fish in that area in the fall. <br>  Denali National Park has campgrounds, but your dog would have to stay in the car if you took a park bus tour or went on a hike.<br>  You can drive the Elliott Highway to the Yukon River and the Arctic Circle.<br>  There are some nice campgrounds on the Richardson Highway between Delta and Valdez.<br>  Since you are in Anchorage, if you have time, why not take one trip to the Kenai Peninsula. Then, on another trip, drive to Glenallen or Valdez and come back by way of the Denali Highway and the Parks Highway. Or drive the Parks Highway to Denali National Park, and go up to Fairbanks and the Arctic Circle, then drive south on the Richardson, back to Anchorage. <br>  Since you are in Anchorage, I recommend that you go to the Alaska Public Lands Information Center. They have information on all the campgrounds in the state. <br>  605 W 4th Ave # 105<br>  Anchorage, AK 99501<br>  (907) 271-2737<br>  <br>  Summer is such a great time to explore Alaska.

AA10250756	You need to stay and finish school and it's very hard to get a job now. For those reasons you can't move away. You need to make some new friends. Get involved in a club at school and meet people who share interests. Most colleges have a gym facility you can use and working out will make you feel more cheerful and give you another group of people to meet. The endorphins your body releases with exercise help as much as chocolate.
Jm3vMKx3aa	No, you can't. The Schengen tourist visa which is valid for 25 countries on the European continent is issued on an itinerary basis and will grant as a maximum 90 days of stay in a 6 months period. There is no way to increase the authorized amount of stay, once the 90 days are used up the visa expires. The same procedure applies to citizens of visa-waived countries.<br>  What you actually could do on a visa waived passport is to spend 90 days within the Schengen zone, then proceed on to visit non-Schengen countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania) for at least 92 days and afterwwards return to the Schengen zone for another 90 days.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <a href="http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/WillkommeninD/EinreiseUndAufenthalt/Schengen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/en/...</a>

Also then look at the travel websites.

Whether you are referring to Subic Town, or to SBMA (the former US Naval Base converted into an R&R), your trip will be worth it.<br>  <br>  Inside SBMA are world-class hotels as well as budget accommodations.

If you are adventurous, you can also trek in the jungle, guided by trained Aetas (natives).<br>  <br>  If you want Subic town instead (outside of SBMA), there are also a lot of beaches with accommodations as low as P500 per room per night (Baloy Beach is almost a public beach).

Recommend Bangkok for two days and then go to either Koh Chang or Koh Samed which are east of Bangkok about 3 to 4 hours from  Bangkok.|`|5Zbs0CThaa	I suggest you travel to Khaosan road because have many cheap hotels.<br>  <br>  You can see site  <br>  www.Khaosan-road.com<br>  <br>  Aod.|`|AA10254694	I would suggest mid April for Songkran.

Rainy season starts in mid April and lasts until August.  Best time to plan a visit is during high season- late October until the start of January.  Keep in mind that rates will be higher.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest staying in Bangkok a few days and then moving on to say- Phuket or Samui for some beach time.  Thailand has some of the world's BEST beaches.
xs2mpYjWaa	The beautiful seaside town of Kiama. It is approx 2 hours south of Sydney located just past Wollongong and Shellharbour. <br>  <br>  There are some really nice caravan parks with beautiful cabins. There is one company with cabins right on the harbour, they're new and look amazing from the outside. Kiama is a small town, but there is plenty to do within a short half hour drive. <br>  <br>  If you are only after one night, try Jamberoo Valley Lodge. Out near the bush Jamberoo Valley Lodge is an old but still clean and comfortable lodge style accommodation. There is no mobile phone reception and the views are amazing. They have a deal for Friday and Saturday nights. Bed, full buffet breakfast & dinner for two for $160, a little more on Saturdays. The meals are delicious, especially the big brekkie. Why not visit the Illawarra Fly while you're in the area.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Ava, you have a couple you can pick from, there is north of Sydney a place called the Central Coast, and then south of Sydney, you have the South Coast, I enjoy the South Coast when I go on vacation to Australia. <br>  <br>  Trip number 5 which I am planning now includes sydney, but I am going to do the rough outback tour, that goes from Sydney to North Queensland, pick up a flight with some airline called bush pilots, across to Darwin, then do the 12 nights from Darwin to the Rock and onto Alice Springs. Do the hot springs, and the champagne balloon breakfast at the rising of the sun at Ayres Rock. Then back to Sydney and do our own thing.<br>  <br>  Chris|`|EqfIQMzQaa	Forster / Tuncurry|`|aXtV5YdFaa	Maybe Gosford or Cessnock. I don't know but I have been their and they're both nice.
KGUidL4daa	Lower Bucks County:<br>  Lower Bucks county has train access and highway access to I-95. I would recommend either Langhorne or Yardley, as both have train stations and both are close to I-95 and US 1. In fact, some people in Yardley actually commute to New York as opposed to Philadelphia, to the point where you can see people from Lower Bucks County on the WTC Memorial. There is a train in Trenton, NJ (Right across the river from Yardley) which takes you to NYC in about an hour and a half. It takes about 45 minutes to get to Philadelphia and two hours to get to New York.<br>  <br>  New Jersey:<br>  Living in New Jersey will make it easier to get to New York but harder to get to Philadelphia. The River Line is a light rail line that runs through towns right near the Delaware River, goes from Camden (right across the river from Philadelphia) to Trenton.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	You can live pretty much anywhere in southern Bucks County.  The train will take you right into the city.  I live in Bensalem and take the train in all the time.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	If getting to NYC regularly is important, you'd want to live probably in southern Bucks County (PA), or maybe southeastern Montgomery County (PA).  The New Jersey side of things doesn't offer much for direct rail to downtown, except in Camden County, which does also have good highway access.  Traffic in Philly can be horrendous, and you don't want to have to cross the city if you can avoid it.  A lot of these areas are suburban or small town places, and have easy train access to the city.  Check out SEPTA's maps for specific places with stops.|`|Nhje1U06aa	roxbourough or manyunk  close to th ecity ,but nice areas and close to 76 so you could hop on the turnpike.  as far as suburbs wayne is nice , but not that much of  a hip crowd.<br>   You could even do the fishtown area of philly  very up and coming minutes from the girard entrance on 95- close to the city great restaurants try the abbey or memphis taproom, T<br>  here is also the northern liberties section of philly great area as well  north bowl is fun , north third has great burgers , adn is close to the highway as well. <br>  bala cynwd is close to city ave -that is near the highway and there is a great target. <br>  conshoken is nice to .  Good luck!<br>   I hope you are going to drexel !|`|Lf16A5sYaa	I'd say Cherry Hill.  You can catch the train into Philly and it's easy to get onto the NJ Turnpike to head up to New York.|`|9d1cb04f2cf649a1dc6fdd65187045d5aa	Newtown or Conshohocken. (Newtowns closer to NYC, but Conshy's closer to Philly)
8p6IlKsGaa	National Express Coach is the cheapest way to go to Edinburgh. It takes 8 hours and cost around 30 pounds but if you book in advance you may be able to get cheap deal. Some times one pound one way.|`|AA11349530	you can take the train but this is very expensive ... quite often a cheaper and quicker option is to fly ... Easyjet fly from Stansted Luton and Gatwick ...

60FewKX6aa	I never had any problems or encountered any dangerous situations. Of course, there are dangerous parts, as any country has dangerous places. Use common sense and you shouldn't have any problems. <br>  <br>  <br>  No one will be racist towards you, Dominicans are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet.<br>  <br>  Bring lots of mosquito spray and a mosquito net. Avoid drinking water from the tap(always drink bottled) Avoid wondering away at night, especially alone, avoid wearing flashy jewelry and things that will call attention to yourself.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pass up a trip to the DR for anything it's a beautiful place to travel, but then again that's just me. <br>  <br>  :)|`|36a3ynpJaa	It depends on what your friend's situation is there.  There is a lot of minor theft there and if you are going to stay with a poorer family, things might disappear.  <br>  <br>  The DR is a beautiful country though and the people are some of the nicest you will meet.  You will get a LOT of attention from the Dominican guys and they are very good at sweet talking girls. The live concerts are great and are very cheap if you are not in a city.<br>  <br>  I would be careful at night in cities on the streets, but the tourist areas are very safe.  If your friend lives in Jarabacoa, it is one of the most beautiful places in the country.  Try to get a Car Wash concert, the mountains and the beach.  Sunday is the big day for the beach for Dominicans.|`|LVCqjz7Kaa	Dominican republic is the country of the Caribbean that more tourist recive. There are safes and dangerous places as almost all the countries of the world. Inside Latin America in one of the least dangerous Countries. What you have to know is that place in specific they are inviting you. Is no the same Harlen and the 5 Ave in New York.|`|AA12075268	I don't know from which hole are your boyfriend and friends. The DR might not be the safest place on earth, but it is not like they make it to be either. I guess you won't know until you make a trip down there. Christmas time is one of the most beautiful times of the year down there.|`|aXtwn7Usaa	dominicans will be one of the nicest people you'll meet,  you should go and enjoy, try the platanos they are very good!  most american go there to the resort and they don't have problems. Is safe|`|d2iFDZk5aa	I go to the DR 3 times a year and honestly I do not find it that dangerous. Just like any other country there are dangerous parts. Just make sure you don't go out alone. I have been many many times and they still do not let me go out alone :). But umm Dominicans are great the culture is great. In all of the times of me being there I have only had one problem with theft, and it was completely my fault. I just came back in January and my camera was stolen but it was my fault because I left it laying around. Word of advice, do not leave anything unattended for even one minute :) if you do that you should have no problems.<br>  <br>  Also what part are you going to? When I go I do not go to the tourist areas I go to Santiago, and the new trend is random desperate people cutting people's hair who have long hair to sell  lol i just thought I would add that because it is kind of funny. So for my whole vacation I pretty much went around with a bun:) but other than that it is a fabulous place.

wMxJDXcRaa	Dubai IS beautiful and yes, alot of rich people live there. I have family living in Dubai and I would not say that it's a crappy place to live...it really depends where you live. However, you HAVE to abide by the law.<br>  The Saudis have banned alcohol and require even foreign women to wear enveloping black robes in public. In contrast, alcohol flows freely in Dubai's hotels and women can wear bikinis on the city's beaches. But what most foreigners who come to Dubai don't know (and what the government is certainly not advertising), is that beneath the surface of the city's liberal facade is a legal culture based on Islamic laws and tribal rules that looks a lot more like Riyadh than Las Vegas.<br>  While the laws are not always enforced, it is illegal for couples in Dubai to hold hands, hug or kiss in public.<br>  Here's a nice link: <a href="http://www.pbase.com/bmcmorrow/dubaimain" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbase.com/bmcmorrow/dubaimain</a>|`|ISfcSfVAaa	1. > yes there are many rich people in UAE local and expacts.<br>  2. > Yes you can hold hand of your spouse and keep your hand on shoulder and walk around . (That's allowed in islamic laws But only Spouse)<br>       > Secondly openly kissing is not allowed as it is totally against Islamic law to do something publicly which create sexually arose in public .<br>  3. > Having sex before marriage is strictly forbidden in islam if it is proved in the court with valid Evidence then there is a punishment but the reality is that many are doing it and in 14 years of living in uae i never heard that some one got punishment for that unless it is done by force that's again world wide crime in all societies. <br>  Over all UAE is a wonderful place to be and live you will never find such friendly place to live around the world.|`|394fe63adc8f8eedd899463e023848c6aa	umm whoever told you dubai is a crappy place is really stupid.<br>  it's even much nicer than it looks like in pics and on tv, trust me.<br>  yes there are a lot of rich people there, but it wont be hard for an average middle class person to fit in there and enjoy the same luxuries as the rich.<br>  no its not true that you cannot hold hands of your spouse in public, i've done it many times (im not even married! engaged...) about the kissing, im not so sure. i believe that wherever country or place you are, its very impolite to kiss in public, so i think you should stay away from doing that...<br>  your last question, i believe only if you're caught... but then again, how will anyone know unless you're not careful?<br>  <br>  you should definitely go and visit Dubai, it's one thing that you wont ever regret!!|`|xBZ5yzPbaa	arrr I want to go and visit Dubai so much! It looks lovely.|`|VZa9oAIuaa	itz better den it looks i dont no who told u|`|HUrYSp4oaa	its a very nice place but it is not as cheap as it used to be. not everyone is rich but there are a lot of rich people there, both western and local. u cannot hold hands or kiss in public that is true they have muslim law there, if ur found having sex before marriage then its possible to go to jail depending on yr religion and the circumstances eg if u were found to be pregnant being unmarried then u would be arrested, best advise to anyone who thinks they may be is not just to go off down yr doctors as u would in uk think first.   they turn a blind eye to westerners living together but as in the case of the sex on the beach couple it is possible to go to jail if u r caught like this.  there is no concept of boy/girl freinds their, they do not have sex before marriage which is why a lot of the local boys try to get western girlfiiends as to their mind they are "easy".  thats not to say everyone is like that i was married to a local. its a nice life there if u have enough money.  im not sure why people would say its a crappy place to live true there are some not so good aspects but then thats the case everywhere, i lived there for 12 yrs and enjoyed it, my kids still talk about it and want to go back so it cant be that bad!  if u get a chance go fora holiday and take a look and decide for yourself. good luck.|`|hMTL2AV7aa	lots of the videos on You Tube bashing Dubai are uploaded by Israelis who see Dubai as their competition , and they are playing dirty by spreading negative rumors about Dubai to attract foreign investors (mainly American companies) to come invest in Israel instead of Dubai. Of course Dubai does not have the political problems they have and this kinds of pisses them off , because any company would take that seriously into consideration when looking for a place to invest in. Also Arab & Muslim countries generally boycott Israeli products so that is another problem for any investor choosing Israel because they will not be able to market such product in the region and will have to pay heavy shipping cost back to the west. This is another area where Dubai has the advantage since it is easy to market from and the shipping ,technology, and logistics are readily available and cost less.<br>  <br>  There are poor & rich like any other place in the world, but of course the rich have more profile in the news.<br>  For spouses kissing in public (as in lips kissing) it is considered disrespectful , but it is not illegal . But if some one is offended they might complain to a policeman , and he will want proof that the two of you are married. Holding hands is not an issue , unless it is done forcibly then it is illegal (like harassment).<br>  Usually if the police see/get a report of some thing like that they will first ask the person/couple to stop doing that, then a warning, then if that person ignores the warning the police will take action , but only in that case. UAE law is based on Islamic law so as long as you remember that you should be fine. Meaning no sex prior to marriage etc..<br>  <br>  In other words what Sea Biscuit said : "it is illegal for couples in Dubai to hold hands, hug or kiss in public." is not correct, it is not illegal , given we are talking about spouses here. However a visitor is expected to respect the customs of the place they visit.
XaVU965Jaa	I think the early morning is the best time of the day anywhere in the world as it is so fresh as a fresh start with birds singing and telling you you have a new day ahead of you.<br>   So, even though I am not one who likes to be up so early, it is also my favorite whereas the afternoon gives you a feeling of urging.

5nYC6RM1aa	..Marhaba :)<br>  <br>  Well, I used to EVERY single night before bed. Now...I just pray in my head whenever I need God the most. I'm at work suffering because I'm so tired, I pray to God in my head and from my heart to please make this day go faster so I can go home and rest my feet. I pray to God whenever I hear a beautiful song or see a beautiful natural scene, I pray to Him because I'm so grateful to be alive and see that beautiful SOMETHING. A lot of people have that misconception that you should always pray before bed. Well, you're supposed to pray at random times whenever you need the Lord, right on the spot.<br>  <br>  God Bless <3|`|FDjn05cNaa	Most days.....even if it is just a few words of praise & thanksgiving !|`|pcCUUJsnaa	haven't done that in a really long tme...I usually pray the most during the Mondial Football matches.|`|9ri2oPNBaa	I can't say how often but it's not as much as it should be :(|`|XaVU965Jaa	My bad!

Thanks Allah!!|`|ie5AKYToaa	I don't remember. It's really difficult since these days, many people pray for insignificant things. It's hard to find someone who will offer a true prayer. Just like Aussie said, I don't want to ask for a huge list of things, especially if those things aren't even truly important. I love listening to what little kids pray for though.<br>  <br>  Although these days, there are many things I'm praying for. I wish for God to help heal my sick friend and to make life a little easier for my parents. And I wish that I will be given patience and endurance to deal with all of this because it hurts to watch all three of them.<br>  <br>  God works in mysterious ways, so maybe, everything I pray for comes to me but it is disguised as something else.|`|0j89XAmhaa	I feel guilty to ask for stuff when I pray, with all the poverty, sicknesses, wars and needs in the world.<br>  <br>  But I did once, I was in a black hole and felt in a no way out situation. so I asked mar Charbel for a solution,  what followed is too freaky and could not possibly have been a random act of chance, I can only attribute it to divine intervention.<br>  <br>  I am since more in tune with the subtle way God operates, but also age has taught me that life was not meant to be a picnic (why not? remains a big mystery question that I keep asking Him)<br>  so you take the good and accept the bad just like any other mortal walking this planet.<br>  <br>  I whispered, "God, speak to me." And a meadowlark sang.<br>  But, I did not hear.<br>  Then I yelled "God, speak to me." Thunder rolled across the sky.<br>  But, I did not listen<br>  I looked around and said, "God, let me see you."<br>  And the stars shined brightly.<br>  But I did not notice<br>  <br>  And, I shouted, "God, show me a miracle."<br>  And, a life was born.<br>  But I did not know.<br>  So, I cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know<br>  you are here." Whereupon, God reached down and touched me.<br>  But, I brushed the butterfly away and walked on.
x79VCZsNaa	Not really there is not any genetic relationship among lebaneses and mexicans, but since several families from lebanon arrived to Mexico during the diaspora, now there is a close relationship between lebaneses of second and third generation who were born in Mexico.. as a Mexican i can tell you that my country have a lot of respect for those lebaneses because they contributed a lot not just culturally but also economically during the last 2 centuries. From lebaneses we learnt for instance new forms of trading, as i mentioned in other questions, lebaneses and jewish were the first who stablish the sistem of purchases on credit.. in the earliest 19th they use to go by tricicles or bicicles home by home selling since spices to cloths and kitchen stuffs, then they stablish their own stores where you were able to go and buy on credito bases..another thing is that culturally they were very active in the world of cine and theather..in some cities like Yucatan where a large amount of lebaneses families settle down they even fussed their cousine with our mexican cousine.. even i can say that they brought the costum of honour St Charbel wich right now is not just saint of Lebanese comunity but also alot of mexicans honour him so i can say that mexicans we love the "arbanos" or turcos as we use to call those lebaneses.<br>  Now in opposite i do not think that lebaneses out of Mexico have a common with my country because our diaspora has just been to our B?G neighbour, but who know as Phoenicians were great navigators they could go to our continent and be in our land....other than it there is nothing that show any relation from Mexico to lebanon..your country is far a way of ours so...<br>  Regarding affection well this is common i have a great affection to lebanon even though i have never been there.. believeme this feeling is like being nostalgic of something you lost since long time ago and you can not recover it.. why i do not know! may be in one of my past lifes i was lebanese :D|`|pcCUUJsnaa	The "e" as the second letter and the "o" as the 6th|`|pURvyRTMaa	poverty|`|9ri2oPNBaa	should they have anything in common?|`|ZwkBpGWuaa	I'm Mexican =D<br>  <br>  And I agree with Liberal, Arpsy and Soccer Darling!<br>  <br>  However, I’m not aware of Lebanon’s economical situation, so I can’t really elaborate on that…<br>  <br>  Anyway, we love and admire Lebanese, and also learned a lot from them. In relation to the film industry, I remember one of my favourite old Mexican movies, “El baisano Jalil”, about a Lebanese immigrant who became a successful businessman and even though some snobbish people looked down on him and his family, he helped them out when they had problems. I was a lil’ kid when I first saw that movie so maybe that’s what kind of started to give me a good impression about Lebanese in Mexico, which I later had the chance to experience in real life and still remains. =)|`|B2MX3vMzaa	Me<br>  I'm mexican from lebanes parents<br>  <br>  S. darling<br>  Spanish doesnt come from Arabic, it comes from Latin, although has more than 1500 words from arabic|`|Ad5DlqfPaa	What do they have in common?

3gTwd93yaa	The GLOBAL economic issues are FAR greater than bruce right now. There is a crisis that basically makes it IMPOSSIBLE for Bruce to get international 'billionaire' investors for all the fabulous projects that would cause rapid redevelopment of the country. <br>  <br>  Its is the same position that Obama is in, with the USA economy declining since he took the presidency. The only difference is that the American people KNOW that the decline wasnt Obama's fault. They are only judging his ability to respond to the crisis, rather than blaming it on him. Jamaicans, on the other hand, simply lack the ability to recognize the connections between this worldwide problem and thier day-to-day reality. <br>  <br>  I have even heard HIGHLY EDUCATED PEOPLE suggest that world oil prices had nothing to do with Jamaica's high oil prices or rapid inflation! They refused to even factor in that the world price of oil DOUBLED internationally during the JLPs first year as government (some highly educated people told me i was 'lying' even when i told them i track oil prices EVERY DAY for the last 4 years!). <br>  <br>  Bruce? has nothing working in his favour right now...except Micheal Lee-Chin's cashy pockets. Butch is weak because tourism OVERALL is down, bauxite is crashing with the world economy, manufacturing is struggling and in many cases is at a standstill. Jobs are being lost and there is NOTHING that Bruce or PJ can do about it... <br>  <br>  I guarantee you that come next election, the PNP will be NOT be educating the public about these realities. They will play to public ignorance and suggest that its the governments fault.|`|KNi7gCMpaa	Nope...Bruce is no better than PJ, he'll get his & forget the little guy.<br>  <br>  Jamaica NEEDS an OBAMA !|`|aQIJp9khaa	Both the J.L.P and the P.N.P has always campaign on the ignorance of the uneducated. Presently, every problem the ruling party faces, is blamed on the opposition.  The minister of agriculture has imported a fertilizer which contains human filth, now it has been exposed, his defense is that the opposition is looking political points. Instead of returning this RAW material to it's producers, the minister has brought experts to say it's okay to use, because it has been dehydrated and it's no longer filth. Brother, that's DRIED SSHHTT. We all know that for fertilizer to be effective it has to be liquefied, once this fertilizer is  hydrated it's back to it's former glory. Our poor rural farmers will be immediately exposed to this pollutant, also their wives and children, and later the most Jamaicans will be consuming contaminated produce that has been grown on this filth. This is prime example of the total disregard, and disrespect our politician has for <br>  Jamaicans and  Jamaica.<br>  How can we say we are proud to be Jamaicans when our food is grown on from the latrines or Americans.<br>  Imagine the result when this "fertilizer" seeps into our water systems.<br>  Will the honourable minister of health, please respond.<br>  Will adding extra seasoning to our delicious meals remove the taste from our minds?<br>  Shakka shame nuh rass.

VE1XDxhjaa	Perhaps education has made some women feel that they need to fight harder, or be more aggressive, to get the job they want at the same level as a man. Some women may overcompensate and start acting overbearing because they feel that is their way to being heard in a predominantly male business culture. Perhaps it is her personality, some women tend to be more aggressive in their pursuits. I don't see anything wrong with a woman being somewhat aggressive or assertive with her education/career just as long as she can be level headed and not turn into a she devil. <br>  <br>  There is also a feminist viewpoint; that they feel entitled to the same jobs as men.<br>   <br>  Women kind of have to prove themselves capable in their education/career pursuits. As a result, they might be quite adept in their field which might bring about a more aggressive attitude.<br>  <br>  For the most part, women are not seen as being able to negotiate the business world as effectively as men do. Men are to remain aggressive, dominant, and at times mean because it is our role to ensure that things get done. Men have an innate sense to fight for his goals. Women have goals too, but they are generally not to be fighters in the business world. <br>  This causes some women to think they can perform just as well as men, or perhaps better, thus enabling a dominant attitude.|`|5e6836dfa778c1efeee10f87746767f4aa	may be this century are like this before that in ancient China women can;t voice anything that they dislike and bully by mother in law|`|30R7gIXtaa	no asian men are like women<br>  women need a white man to be their masters|`|0exde9VEaa	Education has made women more knowledgeable, so making them more assertive and confident, not neccessarily aggresive, dominant or mean ....|`|iW80AcLgaa	maybe, but probably more intelligent, and more enjoyable to talk to, then being ignorant...to Lord percy screw ur self and stop watching porn

Depends on where you are. Let me tell you some general things. The streets are very crowded, and there are no real traffic lights, so I believe crossing may be a problem. Try to get a friend or someone to help you with the streets if you are walking anywhere. I am quite sure you may run into a beggar or two, no matter where you go. As for specifics, if you are staying in Mumbai, you will more likely run into people who can speak English. Otherwise, you can try getting a gist of the Hindi language by watching Hindi movies will subtitles- you will pick some things up. You may not be able to respond so well, but you may have an idea of what they are talking about. I have no advice on Marathi. If you get scared by a person talking to you in Hindi, just say, "Mujhe Hindi nahi aata," and you may be let off the hook. In Mumbai, at least you will be able to see familiar looking roads, in a sense. In Ahmedabad, you will have more problems with dust and heat, but it is still a city. In Pune, you will probably face the best weather. You may get an occasional cold night in Pune, as opposed to in other towns. In Rajkot, you may have issues with dust and mosquitoes, and Rajkot is not so developed, so you may have a few issues living there. I hope I covered enough for you.|`|svgKwoH6aa	yea<br>  depends where.<br>  i come from ludhiana, punjab. basically i live in villages...where the times have not changed since the 1950s. many houses don't have telephones so we still have call centres.<br>  scenery is gorgeous because there are just fields and fields of rice.<br>  <br>  but once you get it into the city, its disgusting. the movie slumdog millionaire basically sums it up for you. you have a country of a billion people and we dont know where to throw our garbage. <br>   the only airport in all of india is in New Delhi, which is a major city. and seriously, you can SMELL the garbage inside when your checking out your bags. its that nasty. but the village is nice and pure...the most natural way i have ever seen planet earth.|`|Ui1vCbPBaa	yes its like heaven....more beautiful by people wise, cluturl wise...business wise....& many many more things...even ensitn sais...we own lots of value to indian coz without them ...it was hard  to understand the value of zero also.......it may b not compare of wid usa & uk but if you see people wise....i think they are d best people in d world...|`|7aVOCIh4aa	Im an indian but i only go to India to visit my family...otherwise its very underdeveloped and dirty.....but still there r SOME places worth visiting<br>   bout which i dont know lol|`|M6uIbKXRaa	i have twice its not like your average city its got more buildings and less people its like overpopulated with buildings|`|tv9fCArraa	yes of course|`|cqGQcCN8aa	no,but i wanna go one day|`|wu47J6WPaa	i wish

Culturally Canadians seem similar to Americans to us & are outspoken, which can be seen as rude in NZ.  Personally I found Canadians far more materialistic than any race I'd ever met (well at least in Toronto).  When I met people, instead of asking me about ME, they would ask bizarre things like what model microwave did I have,  How much are laptops in NZ, what's the minimum wage?  I was appalled.  Even when in public I always seemed to overhear conversations about the best deal on a car or how much something or other cost.  It all seemed a bit greedy to me.  I also find Canadians to be very spoilt, which is offputting to a NZer.  For instance they complain over the slightest thing & have unrealistic expectations.  When I backpacked around Europe, it was only the Canadians that complained in the youth hostels about there not being hair dryers, etc, as though they expected a $20 a night youth hostel dorm to be like 5 star accomodation.  Also my sisters & my partners Canadian relatives are quick to complain & demand the best when they are staying with you in your home.  I find this insulting.<br>  <br>  Ironically, despite what I've said above, I also think Canada is the most politically correct country in the world.  I recall seeing a kids cartoon about a mother cat who gave up her kittens for her career, someone told her she was selfish & she then broke into song (it was a musical cartoon!) about how she didn't feel guilty as it was her right as a mother!!  The most bizarre cartoon I've ever seen.  Also when I as there about 10 years ago there were 2 American bank robbers who got caught crossing the border into Canada.  They had the audacity to plead political asylum based on the fact that they'd go to jail if they returned to the USA.  Unbeleivably, the Canadian Government granted them asylum!!!!!  That is just ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Canadians I've met complain that the Government is too lenient with who they allow into Canada.  My sister pointed out houses in her neighbourhood where the Russian mafia live & complained about Somalian criminals who come as refugees who are not sent back to Somalia once convicted of a crime as apparently there was a bit of a crime wave with them back then.<br>  <br>  Socially it all seemed to be Sports Bars with Ice Hockey on (in Toronto anyway).  I found this boring & no one looked at the screen unless there was a fight in the hockey game.  People openly admitted that that's why Canadians like hockey so much, it's not the game, it's the fights.<br>  <br>  Surprisingly I thought Canadian men were very sexist compared to NZ ones.  I had some horrible incidents in particular in the Ontario town of Burlington.  Not surprised it's known as the serial killer town.<br>  <br>  In politics, NZ has an MMP Government, which is modelled on the German system.|`|2WxxStXIaa	Difference.?<br>  <br>  NZ  has nothing like this. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Voters<br>  The Now very popular real Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  8. Discriminatory and Dishonest Immigration System.<br>  Immigration to Canada is based on a point system, obtained with your education, qualifications and job experience. Points are good enough for immigration, but in Canada, they are not good enough to get a job in your field. Amazing, how the credentials that qualify you to come to Canada are the same credentials that don't qualify you for your profession in Canada. The reason is, Canada only wants immigrants to do the labor jobs - pizza delivery, driving taxis, factory work etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  7. Out Of Control Cost Of Living.<br>  From rent, to utility bills, to shopping, to phone, internet and cable bills, to gas, to car insurance, to eating out, to basically anything you have to pay for or buy, the cost of living in Canada has become astronomical. Recent immigrants are astonished as to how expensive everything is. It is estimated that compared to most countries around the world, the cost of living in Canada is on average five times greater.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Health Care Crisis.<br>  Practicing physicians in Canada are in a shortage, 1 in 4 Canadians cannot get a family doctor. Canadian doctors are leaving to move permanently to the United States. Statistics Canada and the Canadian Medical Association both have identified that for every 1 American doctor that moves to Canada, 19 (nineteen) Canadian doctors move to the United States! Doctors in Canada are overworked and underpaid, and there is a cap on their salaries.<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Very High Taxes.<br>  Yes, you have the GST, the PST, totaling 15%, on practically everything you purchase and many other taxes taken out of our weekly paycheck. You have to pay a whopping amount to the government, out of your hard earned salary, so that the government can turn around and give it to beer drinking, hockey watching welfare bums. Fair? It does not matter, it's Canada.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. Money Hungry Government.<br>  Canadian Embassies around the world lie to foreigners, painting this picture that Canada is Utopia, because they want them to come to Canada. Why? Because foreigners bring money! So after being deceived, these foreigners come. They must bring with them at least $10,000. Canada has an immigration quota of 250,000 per year. So please do the math, 250,000 multiplied by $10,000 each equals a whopping 2.5 Billion dollars that Canada gains from immigrants every year.<br>  <br>  <br>  3. No Culture.<br>  Unlike almost every other country in the world, Canada has no culture. Actually American culture is what dominates Canada. When was the last time you had some 'Canadian' food? There are no Canadian traditions and there is no national identity. What does it even mean to call yourself a 'Canadian'. . .nothing really. People living in Canada, still identify themselves with the country they 'originally' came from.<br>  <br>  <br>  2. Worst Weather.<br>  Yes, Canada has the worst weather conditions of any country in the world. Freezing cold temperatures, snow, ice, hail, winds, storms etc. From the Prairie provinces to the Maritimes, from the Territories to southern Ontario, the weather is so horrific and disgusting that many Canadians leave Canada simply because of this reason alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. No Jobs.<br>  Yes, coast to coast, there are no jobs. Immigrants are highly qualified (MD's, PhD's, Lawyers, Engineers etc.) but they are driving taxi cabs, delivering pizza's or working in factories. Even people with bachelors degrees from Canadian Universities cannot find jobs after graduation. This is the tragedy associated with immigration to Canada. I feel sorry for those immigrants who are stuck in Canada for the rest of their lives. It is indeed a very sad and hopeless future.<br>  <br>  <br>  Broad daylights shootings.<br>  <br>  Break-ins and MS 13 (Most dangerous gang in the world)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vancouver is now...<br>  <br>  The Gang Capital of North America.<br>  <br>  ... and fast becoming worst...<br>  <br>  MS13 is now right on your son's and daughter's doorsteps.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Similar, a commonwealth country with a strong British connection, same political system, Corrie on the telly, etc<br>  but at the same time a huge influence from the USA<br>  I'd love to visit, if I win the lottery|`|l4pVsxoraa	When they flush their toilets in New Zealand the water spins down the drain in the opposite direction.|`|62a782905683852221ca54bad3c08636aa	Canada is a very large country geographically, New Zealand, relative to Canada is tiny.<br>  <br>  People in NZ are crazy about Rugby, the same way Canadians are crazy about hockey.<br>  <br>  Stephanie:<br>  <br>  Before you spout off about Canada's immigration policy, you'd better have a look at New Zealand's historical attempts at whites only immigration. I'm not saying Canada's immigration policy is perfect (especially historically with things like the Chinese head tax) but the non-subjective points system is an attempt to remove racial and cultural bias from the proceedings.<br>  <br>  You sound like a bitter idiot.<br>  <br>  Zebra, people in Toronto might only watch hockey for the fights but that's because the Leafs suck. Normal Canadians don't just watch hockey for the fights.
10a75ee0424e1f57ac73550ada2b49deaa	In the Middle Ages in the Flemish city of Ieper (well known Ypres from Flanders fields WW1) there existed the custom to throw a series of live cats from the 210 feet tower of the city hall. This was because the felines were supposed to be the recipients of Satan et alii and were considered kind of godlike. To prove to the people they were ordinary annimals the count of Flanders ordered them executed. <br>  Right now--even if you do not believe it--the custom goes on at carnival---A buffoon climbs  the tower and throws the cats into the crowd. However the cats today are stuffed animals!!!|`|7jM9Ghchaa	never heard of this and the person who told you this should be locked up ?that would be cruelty to animals ?and would be a prison service for life?|`|1dvVXWc4aa	You are so naive.They were throwing the cats to proove that they always land on four feet.That was an experiment only.<br>  <br>  Finally tell the people there they can throw alive cats.They will land on four feet.<br>  But not on to the crowd,otherwise there ll be some people scratched.

We don't get real snow anywhere else and any that does fall on a particularly cold day always melts within a few hours.<br>  <br>  Australia's wild animals won't ever bother you unless you bother them in their own habitat. Kangaroos, koalas and our other marsupial natives are harmless and very timid and the only dangerous large animals are crocodiles in the far north of the country and sharks in the sea and it's very easy to stay away from both. <br>  <br>  Australia is completely rabies free so that's not a problem, so if it's furry and lets you touch it, the worst that will happen is that it may bite you (like a dog or cat) - it can't harm you too badly and will never attack.<br>  EDIT:<br>  oldemystic has emailed me to remind me that we do have a form of rabies here that is found only in bats. Don't touch bats and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  People in the suburbs and cities are never bothered by snakes which are the only animals you need to be concerned about and you're very unlikely to ever see one, even outside built up places.

Canberra and Melbourne can get bitterly cold in winter especially when the winds come from the Mountains. Further North though we don't have snow . Most Australians that have never been to the snowy Mountains or out of the country have never seen snow. As for wild animals well we aren't a country known for a lot of wild animals mostly Kangaroos and wallabies some Koalas in a few areas Camels in the desert but not many of them Buffalo in Northern Territory but they are rare. Snakes yes but I've only ever seen 2 or 3 Country people would see more . all of these animals are afraid and runaway from humans.

AA10662056	Japanese people (particularly men) are getting more and more reluctant to get married now. They say one third of Japanese men in their 20s now will remain single until 50.<br>  <br>  It's difficult for you to find a husband in Japan. I mean, it's difficult even if you were a Japanese woman.<br>  <br>  But being a Caucasian does not make it more difficult for you. Anyway, you can try and find a husband if you are lucky.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	The possibility may remain as same as you question in Botswana or <br>  Tajikistan.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	I don't know but they aren't very open to foreigners (this is obviously less true in cities and urban areas), or at least dating foreigners. It's more common for a Japanese girl to date a foreign man than the other way around. Some people are ok with foreigners, some aren't. Depends on the person more than society, but if you're looking for a society answer, then it's just sort of.... "iffy"|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	It's possible, of course. I think love tends to occur when people are NOT looking for it. You can increase your odds by talking to different guys and meeting new people, but you can't force it.  It's a shame when people waste their time in Japan looking for lovers (this is usually men, but it applies to anyone). If it happens, it happens. Otherwise, just enjoy the sites and make friends!|`|1jStyhU1aa	No problem Japanese people are open minded people the only thing i heard is that some areas don't really like foreigners, but there all not like that though i would go to tokyo you'll see some black and white people there last time i went there, there was a black guy running a sport shop i went to... good luck on your trip ^^ if people stare at you its because they barley see any other race there... lol|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Yes, but it's far less common than couples where the male is white.But don't let that stop you.There's many Japanese men out there who like white women.They just don't have the chance to meet them.Don't worry what other people think.It's your life.|`|5pMzAEr6aa	no offense but have you been living in a cave? haven't you ever seen cross cultural marriages? they're all over the place dude|`|GTAKIE9kaa	depend on personality, if there is fate, you will find one|`|6uQh4VSpaa	I definitely know a few Japanese guys that would love to date a foreigner!  When I was there, they complained that foreign guys liked Japanese girls, but foreign women didn't like Japanese guys.  <br>  <br>  One possible hitch (and by 'possible' I mean 'unlikely') is that a guy who is more traditional, might be harder to date.  My impression is that while in the West, the man is supposed to 'do the work' when dating (be romantic, pay for stuff, etc), in Japan it's much more equal.  For example, on Valentine's day, women give men chocolate.  Period.  Men get another month (until White Day, 3/14) before they have to worry about it.  So, if a guy is more traditional, he might expect you to do some of those things.  But a guy who wants to date a foreigner will presumably be much more open-minded, so I wouldn't worry too much about it!|`|9IrdMFX7aa	I am a European (Austrian), married with a Japanese woman. I lived in Japan for 12 years. During the time I lived in Japan I very often had the chance to make friends with a Japanese woman. I can tell you, they are even after you. As I had been married already, I was not interested, but there is a boom of marriages between foreign people and Japanese people going on at the moment. I am sure you will find a nice husband. You will even have the possibilty to choose between various people. <br>  <br>  Take your time and try to figure out if the character of the other person suits you. You could become the member of a sports club where young people can get to know each other, or you might even find somebody in a train, who suddenly tries to speak English with you. There are so many ways young people can get to know each other.<br>  <br>  My wife and me we got to know in a Mc Donald in Austria. We were sitting at the same table, when she handed a tissue over to me. Embarressing isn't it. Now we have two children.|`|vS80xcoHaa	Believe it or not, it is easier for a White woman to settle down in Japan than it is for a White man. <br>  <br>  The reason is simple: If you marry a Japanese, your husband is expected to work in the Japanese workforce. This isn't a problem since he is Japanese. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you were a White man and you married a Japanese woman, your Japanese wife would expect you, the White man, to join the Japanese workforce. This is difficult (but not impossible), since you are not Japanese. (There are ways around this: Teaching English is, by the far, the most popular alternative.)<br>  <br>  Get it? <br>  <br>  So it easier for you, because Japanese culture puts more pressure on the husband to be the bread winner in the family. And rest assured, there are many Japanese men who would be interested in you.
mmWeBRRtaa	I fly out of Oakland regularly.  I always get to the airport 2 hours in advance.  Even though I check baggage, I always have plenty of spare time to have a meal, read a paper, etc.<br>  <br>  You didn't say which airline you're taking.  Southwest Airlines leaves from terminal 2 (on the left side), and all others from terminal 1 (right side).  Southwest recommends arriving 2 hours in advance:<br>  <a href="http://www.southwest.com/travel_center/suggested_arrival.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.southwest.com/travel_center/s...</a><br>  <br>  You'd really be fine arriving 90 minutes in advance, but two hours gives you a safety margin in case everything goes wrong.  Oakland is a much smaller airport than JFK.  It's kind of slow to unload baggage from arriving flights, but otherwise it's very good.<br>  <br>  Here's a little-known tip:  Once you've passed through security, you can walk to gates in either terminal (because they're connected by a corridor).  If you see that the security line is very long in one terminal, you can take a short outside walk to the other terminal.  If the line there is much shorter, go through that line, and then walk to your gate.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  US Air is located in Terminal 1, on the building to the right as you face the airport from the road where passengers are dropped off.<br>  <br>  I've seen cases where the security line in Terminal 1 is much shorter than that in Terminal 2.  I'm not sure whether the reverse occurs, but it may depend on the time of day.  In any case, I've never never encountered an excessive delay in either terminal.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Oakland has far fewer flights than SFO, and doesn't have the weather problems that tend to slow down flights.  <br>  <br>  I've never had a problem or delay using Oakland.|`|jYPeis3Saa	you should be ok. <br>  <br>  if you're really worried then show up at 10am.<br>  <br>  <br>  ive flown out of and into oakland many times and i dont remember a time that ive had to wait in line for very long. <br>  <br>  san francisco is another sotry. i always have issues there

yULnOJUwaa	Well, logic says why don't you just ask your friend who lives in Gilbert what fun things there are to do there that she'd like to do with you?  Wouldn't that be the easiest thing to do?  I'm sure they have a day spa there in the Gilbert area without having to travel way across town to the Boulders - that would quite a drive for you!  <br>  <br>  The Chandler Ostrich Festival is fun and will be held March 13-15.  That would be good for laughs watching the animals race.  Chandler is not far from Gilbert.  I've heard there is a spa in Chandler called<br>  Simplicity Day Spa that comes recommended.  Have fun!|`|JLayHNZCaa	Hopefully some from that area will answer, but, if not, you could visit tripadvisor.com a free site with reviews of attractions, hotels and restaurants.  Type Gilbert Arizona into the search box.  If that doesn't come up, try a city near there that you know.  If you want, you can ask in the forum for that city or one near it and someone will have the info. you want.  You can even leave your own review when you get back on what you did do.|`|jz9CnL2Eaa	One of the nicest spas in the Phoenix area is The Golden Door at the Boulders Resort.  <br>  <br>  The negatives are that it's on the far north end of town, as to where Gilbert is on the southeast side and it is very expensive.  <br>  <br>  The positives are it is absolutely world class, extremely attentive, VERY pampering.  The setting (the resort is so named for a reason) is breathtaking.  When you are done there, the very fun little town of Cave Creek is just a five minute drive away.  Excellent Mexican food can be found at El Encanto, where you can sit pond-side and drink fabulous margaritas.

IuPO44eraa	1)The best beaches and shacks in goa are on the beaches of calangute, baga, Vagator and Ozran, however these beaches are kinda little crowded.. so if you like quite places, i'd suggest you visit the beaches in the north such as Morjiim, Ashven and Terekhol or the southern beaches of Palolem and Cab de Ram.<br>  <br>  2) Shacks in goa are not all too expensive... You can find accomodation easily for rs 700- 1500 per day in a guest house the rates being dependent on the season...<br>  <br>  3) Bikes and cars can be hired from the guest house owners or the locals. The locals will easily arrange for it if you ask them to as it is quick money for them...<br>  <br>  4)A bike will cost you between 300 to 600 per day while a jeep will cost you 2000-3000 per day.<br>  <br>  5)Night life is a lot more happening in  North goa.

Please do not get misled by any vicious campaigns from any quarters of unqualified slothful mindsets.<br>  <br>  Easter is a good time to be in Goa as the place gets pretty festive due to the easter celebrations etc.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of tours undertaken in Goa and by the end of your two weeks you should get a pretty good idea about Goa. However you need to plan your trip wisely. There are tours for south and north separately. Besides that you can get to know about Goa only when you are here. The internet is mostly full of pampered observations and may not give you the correct picture.<br>  <br>  Bartering happens very frequently and it is only in the flea markets of Anjuna or probably at the Ingo's market at a place called Arpora in North Goa. In south I reckon it happens at the colva night market on Mondays. However for that you need to be skillful and will have to first observe the markets for a day or two. Dont go headlong first up.<br>  <br>  If you want a nice comfortable stay in Goa at nominal rates, especially in South Goa, I can suggest Colva beach area to be ideal as it is central to most beaches in the south. <br>  <br>  Instead of expensive hotels you could always check out some good , clean and spacious accomodation at a fraction of the hotel cost. The answer to that is self-contained apartments.<br>  <br>  There are some well maintained sparkling apartments in Colva just 5 minutes from the beach and are equipped with airconditioners, refigerator, geyser, gas connection , utensils, fresh bedding, television etc with a living room, a bedoom, kitchen area and a spacious bathroom.<br>  <br>  The apartment is available at only for Rs 1300/- per day which is a steal in Goa and I know that stays of longer duration are available at a discounted price if booked in advance.<br>  <br>  check out this blog <a href="http://www.goacom.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.goacom.blogspot.com</a> and click on apartments on rent in Goa on the RHS under LABELS.

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	The recession has hit southern California very hard. Our most recent budget makes California the most expensive, and highly tax place in the country. It resulted in major funding cuts to all levels of education including colleges. Grants and student loans were made more difficult to get.

But if it ever were built the "Illinois Tower" would likely be in Dubai or China, or wherever the next financial superpower ends up.|`|xJS3BdUNaa	No, I heard it was an engineering impossibility.<br>  <br>  even if it could be built, the entire thing would be filled with elevators to get all the way to the top.  there would be very little useable space.<br>  <br>  But I agree, it would be super cool.  there are some cool skyscrapers going up in Chicago though!
x26bUIYHaa	I went when i was about your age, and it is not bad at all. The small children attend a day camp all day, and at night are supervised by their parents, if they are out at all. I assume you are going to Beaches, but if you really really want to go for a place that has a more adult atmosphere I suggest Sandals, which is right next door, but I don't know if they will take you, since you are still underage. And the resort is very nice, and the staff is friendly, however, some of the food is not top notch, like the buffets. The sit-down restaurants are pretty good though. If you go, join the teen program, cause as lame as it sounds, its actually a ton of fun, and it's better then sitting around with your parents. <br>  <br>  Anyway, it's a great place, and the sesame street characters will not bother you at all, they are only out at certain times. Its a great vacation, and I hope you end up going!|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Beaches is the 2008 Top Family Resort. You will enjoy it there, and if ever you see Elmo, just asked him not to bother you... Hope you enjoy your stay...|`|mDYsr62maa	Um, that would be up to the adults since they are paying for the trip and probably really need it.  Go lay on the beach if the activities are not to your liking.|`|S03AviD7aa	We are going Jan 2010 and I have been looking at peoples home videos of it on youtube. I haven't seen elmo or many kids in hardly any of the videos. Majority of the clips I watched have kids about your age in them at a teen dance party or hanging out in the pools and at the beaches. Any parent traveling that far with young children are going to either have them in the daycare part or with them around the beach or pool. It looks like its going to be a blast. Enjoy it, I think you will love it. go check out youtube.

Other then 1% tax on salary there and a 10% tax on rent there are no taxes in Bahrain.<br>  <br>  Also ask the company to provide for medical insurance

Also, check out Rick Steve's book on Back Door Europe which is dedicated on cheap travel including info on stayiing in hostels (super cheap rooms).

The founder of morocco Molay Idriss 1st and his son Bought islam to morocco and established it there.  They also made Fez the spiritual and intellectual capital of the world. There Graves are well visisted places as Idriss was the great grandson of the Muhammed the prophet. They also have the largest tanniers in morocco, youc an go see them work and smell it too (hehehe) they have the old royal palace which is now a museum with lots of goodies inside only 2dirhems to get in. <br>  They also have the Kings palace there you cant go inside but you can get a peek into the palace from the hill side.<br>  Also they have the first ever university in the world, its the oldest and its FREEEE to get in. It has gorgeous courtyards and architecture inside. from outside it is a plain Red earth buildign but inside is beautiful.<br>  <br>  They ahve the Old kasbah, also knwon as fez balia (Old) and new fez, Fez jdid. its quiet easy to get to each location.<br>  When we went we stayed at the closest Hotel to the train station which is 2 mins walk from our hotel. we stayed at IBIS. and it was lovely, air con, breakfast was nice, buffet style, swimming pool.<br>  <br>  They have a 5 star hotel which is GEORGOUSSSS which is about 15mins away from the station. but very pricey.<br>  Ibis was affordable for us and it was great service.<br>  Good transport too. right outside the hotel is taxi ranks and bus stops.<br>  Having french is good. but you will be suprised by the amount of english speaking people. <br>  <br>  Beware of men in the market who latch onto you, they will show you around and be all nice and do a great job but they are not doing it for free, dotn forget.<br>  I am moroccan and when i went there i felt like a tourist and peopel tryed to sell us crap and show us about. LOL<br>  <br>  Anyway, Fez is pretty safe. they have pick pocktes but you wont find any iolent crimes or be abused. Just pick pockets, so make sure tehy wear money belts.<br>  I know this sounds bad but the less they look like tourists the better, they will not be bothered to much.<br>  <br>  <br>  I love Fez i shall be returing soon i hope. Marrekch is next on my list now iv seen fez thats the next step.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually they have riads in the old city. They are traditonal court yard style hotels in the small narrow streets, they are failry cheap. but no air con. thats if they want a proper moroccan experince. and when they step out onto the streets they are in the heart of old Fez kasbah. I would stay there next time round.<br>  There are pleanty of cheap restuarnts in the city. pizza places. but in old fez they will cook you authentic morocan food. My mother is the best moroccan cook but i have to admit some places are in competion with her cooking hehehe. and liek i said very cheap to have a 3 course meal out in old fez. <br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats wo your daughter and son in law.

"Valtur" hotels are operated like Club <br>  Meds in that they are totally all-inclusive: you receive everything (room, meals, activities) for one set price. But the staff here is Italian, the cuisine Italian (one resort lists 30 varieties of pasta on its menu), the service Italian and superb, and there's none of the emphasis on an unmarried, single clientele that's found at some Club Meds. sentimental and caring Italian staff, anxious to establish their resort in the American market, you'll enjoy a honeymoon of swimming, sailing, and remarkable sightseeing of Morocco, in as luxurious a setting as you'd wish, but at an unprecedented bargain price.

But if they like to be on the move it's best to probably keep base in Marrakech and move around from there.|`|YR2d8Kg7aa	I would certainly look at arranging a Riad, they are beautiful, romantic, and different.  They could look at doing a 2/3 day tour that would take in different areas such as Fes, where there is the World Heritage site - Medina Fes El Bali, Marrakech, Essaouira, Casablanca.  They could look to stay overnight in a Bedouin tent if they want a bit of adventure....<br>  <br>  There are some beautiful Riads and hotels in Morocco, and are reasonable priced.  They could always look to add the honeymoon to the wedding list.... and/or include excursions and tours that they may be interested in.<br>  <br>  If you would like more info, feel free to contact me.|`|wbhqShh6aa	Asilah is a small and romantic little town, thats where I spent my honeymoon...but go in the off season...its quiet and cheaper.  Mohammadia is also a very nice little town.  The other large cities that others mentioned are great places to visit but I dont recomment them for honeymooners because the big cities are lively crazy places, unless you have a long trip and can take it different environments.  As a general rule the middle and south of the country and more friendly and inviting than the northern areas.|`|AA12088024	try these sites<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.visitmorocco.com/index.php/eng/content/view/full/2" rel="nofollow">http://www.visitmorocco.com/index.php/en...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.davidsbeenhere.com/places" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidsbeenhere.com/places</a><br>  under the category africa choose morocco that's gonna give u some ideas where to go and what to do<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/davidsbeenhere" rel="nofollow">http://www.myspace.com/davidsbeenhere</a>|`|mP8ILrC4aa	ifran is beautiful and romantic<br>  agadir<br>  casa..hassan ii mosque<br>  rabat ir very nice..kings tomb is there<br>  fez is beautiful with the architure<br>  mediterranean is beautiful..nador or houcema|`|hAUBw6ffaa	marrakech baby|`|bhNaTYjOaa	I would say Marrakech|`|7aoHmM4baa	i would say agadir|`|PwIB51ycaa	Ifran , Tanger , Marrakech There the best Ifran Snows Alot And At The Moment Is Snowing Alot Tanger Lovely Beaches Marrakech Nice Hotels More cultral than the others lovely food Fez is also quite nice loads of mosques
mZULxCbhaa	USAA? I work in colorado springs. I really enjoy colorado springs, we have warm summers and cold winters. fun things nearby, and denver is just an hour away. Not much crime here, the only thing that happens more often than any city are school and chruch shootings. but overall people are friendly, kind, and a good city.
pm2EeEgiaa	1. From SM Molino, take a jeepney to Talaba in Bacoor. (Fee: PhP 7.00, Time: 20 minutes).<br>  <br>  2. Ride a bus going to Lawton, and get down in Taft Avenue MRT Station or Pasay Rotonda - ask the bus conductor to tell you when you are near. (Fee: PhP 15.00, Time: 30 minutes).<br>  <br>  3. Ride the MRT and get down at North Avenue (the last MRT station) - the station will link directly to TriNoMa. (Fee: PhP 14.00, Time: 30 minutes).<br>  <br>  *This tour itinerary is a little bit faster (1 hour and thirty minutes).|`|Imqb5ueqaa	From SM Molino, take a jeepney to Bacoor/Aguinaldo Hi-way. From Aguinaldo Hi-way, take buses (San Agustin Bus Line, for one) that goes to Monumento but be sure to take the ones that pass thru CUBAO, not via Lawton.<br>  <br>  Get off at Trinoma. The bus conductor, or even your seat mate in the bus can tell you when you are near Trinoma.<br>  <br>  Including the jeepney ride from SM Molino, travel time on  normal traffic conditions is 2 hours.|`|EjhJliKmaa	by metered taxi
VddvHu9haa	??? maybe some more details?<br>  Usually everything is ok, and<br>  I guess so is at the moment, I was just talking with my brother (who is in Warsaw) on Skype and everything is ok. Maybe it depends on network, he has the 'netia' broadband.<br>  You can check the connection speed on this website:<br>  <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net/</a>
7RbootLlaa	I can only comment as a victim of travelling parents and only on school holidays. Just make sure that your children are fully occupied with something. In my day it was just books, puzzles and drawing.<br>  If only I had tv, game consoles, dvds. <br>  <br>  Otherwise the penalty for being unprepared will be, "Are we there yet?"<br>  Roughly about every 1 km that will happen and GOOD LUCK - You'll <br>  need it. lol

R2iCzRjsaa	Yes,  yes, and yes.  Why Phuket?   Ao Nang Beach in the Krabi area gives you access to the same islands, far cheaper, I like better; and you can still take a boat over to Phuket for a day or more.  Koh Chang is Nice, much cheaper.<br>  <br>  OR, Pattaya, no matter what you have heard has WONDERFUL places available (2 bd 2 bath HOUSES) for 12, 000 a month, if you rent a car and 15 minutes from beaches and away from the sleaze of downtown.  That's why Pattaya is now the second largest city in Thailand....he has more than bars and go-go people.|`|4HomAucQaa	Now may be too late  But still looking for there would recommend  at Katina Hotel , there are good location for any transportation/food/drinks/shopping)  and now have pro  Free Shutter Bus Services to Robinson and Central Department stores<br>   <br>  ... have fun ..at Phuket ... ..
CNSGz12zaa	Do not deny the Holocaust as they do not have free speech over there. You will go to jail|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Don't jaywalk. Seriously. In fact, don't cross the street when the little man on the traffic lights is red, even if there's no traffic coming. You will get yelled at. <br>  <br>  Don't get on public transport without first buying a ticket. This can be extremely expensive.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Whatever country you visit it is in your interest to observe all its laws. Germany is a pretty modern and free country. You can do more or less anything you can do where you live. And the same things are prohibited.|`|EFGKxSsVaa	what? ive been to germany plenty of times..<br>  I have no idea what you're talking about when you're talking about laws that you need to take into consideration!|`|amUPPnuDaa	Don't do the Hitler Salute there - it's illegal! Seriously. <br>  <br>  The Nazi party is also outlawed there, so don't wear an armband.|`|O5KOwhovaa	All of them.|`|0UqOwLCjaa	Don't sit near bears. While in the rest of the world you are free to sit wherever you please among bears, for some mind-numbing reason, it's forbidden in Germany. They say it's for preventing the bears from mangling you to death, but I don't get it.
AA11496012	If you are going to be using the green card as the picture ID that you will show to security, then that is the name you should use on the airplane ticket.  Therefore use your maiden name with the middle name or initial.  When you return, still use the green card as your ID.  Next time you travel, you can use the passport.|`|NcQY1ayRaa	YOUR NAME!<br>  i watched a program in the UK called Airport and he wasnt allowed on the flight because it had his brothers name on the ticket.<br>  <br>  put yours one.|`|UYaWH7a0aa	You may really want to call the airlines directly and inquire with them. Security will generally check the names against the names on your legal documentation - which would be your passport - but if that name changes halfway through your flight I'm not sure of the 'proper' procedures in that case - definitely call the airlines and they should be able to lead you in the right direction.
km9cQNAXaa	Assuming you mean the Melbourne in Australia then you will need at least 1 stop on route to the UK. Depends on the Airline where the stop is. The flight is likely to be 7 to 8 hours for each leg plus about 2 hours for the refuelling stop so that's around 18 hours in total.<br>  <br>  The good news is that Surrey is close to Heathrow. it should be possible to get to your final destination within about 2 hours of arrival at Heathrow<br>  <br>  If you can get a flight to London-Gatwick airport then getting to Surrey is even easier.
