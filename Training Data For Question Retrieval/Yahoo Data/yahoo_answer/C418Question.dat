I 'm talking about big chunks, one to two ft square, covering a 30 ft square area.  How can I stop them?  (I live in the city).      My local wildlife people suggested a) putting black garbage bags around because the rustling and movement scares them, b) putting out towels soaked in ammonia because they hate the stink, and c) spraying the lawn with dog and cat repelling pepper spray.      The problem is it is raining almost every day.  The rain washes off the pepper spray, it washes the ammonia off the towels onto the lawn, and it makes the bags wet so they don't rustle.  The 'coons love the rain because it brings the grubs up to the point where they are just under the lawn.       Any suggestions?

20090305025559AAUrYkQ	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	What kind of siding should I use?	Today I made an offer on a house built in 1955. It has a brick front and wood siding on the other three sides. it also has a 1/2 completed addition and a separate apartment in the back. I am think that I will go with wood siding on the addition to match the original house or replace all the siding  on the origional house and install siding on the addition with a newer product like an engineered  or cement product. I also have to replace the siding the apartment in the back ASAP as it has no siding on it now at all, but the interior is nearly all remodeled.      So here is my questions. I need to figure out what kind of siding has the lowest material cost and how would you handle the addition-wood to match or total replacement of the siding? The addition will actually have more siding on it than the original house! and as for the apt. I want to go with something that looks close to the same but with the lowest cost.       Now I will make it even harder-I need to get the house up to FHA specs asap with as little cost as possible due to financing considerations. As soon as I get it their I can refinance and save 3.75% in interest! But I do not want to waste a lot of money to get it there and then rip off fairly new siding to redo it next year.

We have to remove the rubber ends which prevent the chairs from damaging the wooden floors. There are about 100 of these chairs each has a rubber stopper on the end of each leg so we have to remove 400 of them and we are having trouble removing them, does anyone have a simple way to do this?

They're avocado green and are in pristine condition; they work great and are in great physical condition.  I just bought all new appliances.  Are my vintage appliances worth trying to sell or should I let them just haul them away?  I have a dishwasher, range, refrigerator, and hood.

20070223063103AAiCg8D	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Is dryer a fire hazard?	I just bought a new Whirlpool dryer and used it for the first time this morning. About 15 minutes through it's cycle I had noticed that I had forgot to put in a dryer sheet. When I opened the dryer, in the back where the little metal thing is with the holes (sorry I don't know what it is called), I could see this bright red glow. I am almost positive that the dryer is hooked up correctly because a professional came and installed it along with the washer. I waited about 20 minutes and started the dryer again. And again, after about 15 minutes, when I opened it I could still see this bright red glow that would die down within about 5 seconds. Does anyone know if this is could potentially start a fire? Or is this normal? (OH and it is an electric dryer if that helps).
