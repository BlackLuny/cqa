dec89da3459139d6d173b9fcc8097308aa	The Texas Roadhouse in my town starts you off at minimum wage and gives you a share of waitress tips.|`|7EV9fqM3aa	Bussing tables is the definition of an entry level job. You do the grunt work and rely upon the abilities of others to do their jobs well enough to tip you out well enough to make it all worth your effort.<br>  <br>  Corporate places like TX Roadhouse will pay you as little as possible (most likely below minimum wage because if servers tip you out you will be considered a tipped employee and eligible for pay less than the minimum) while expecting you to do far more than your wages would compensate for.<br>  <br>  If this is your best option for employment then go for it. I would suggest you apply to non-corporate places, first, that pay an actual minimum wage and still offer the extra money of being tipped out. <br>  <br>  Just find a nicer restaurant in town, one of those snooty, expensive places, and apply to bus there. They will pay more and you will have better opportunities to both make more tips and be promoted.

7HEZhx46aa	According to IMDB, he actually lost 40 pounds during the movie.<br>  <br>  In order to lose the required amount of weight for the present day scenes, Matt Damon went on a strict regimen of food deprivation and physical training. This caused his health to become so frail that he was put on medical supervision for several months after the shoot. However, his efforts didn't go unnoticed: director Francis Ford Coppola was so impressed by Damon's display of method acting, that he offered him the leading role in The Rainmaker (1997).

It's the second Bleach movie. It came out in Japan on 12/22/2007. <br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  When an artifact known as the "Kingdom Treasure Stamp" is stolen during transport from Soul Society, Tōshirō Hitsugaya goes to retrieve it.

seEcP7QIaa	The Bus Boys|`|3391590d3dfaf7534284f967f7219491aa	Thin Lizzy.|`|AA11615379	The Bus Boys are an African-American quintet known for playing rock & roll with a new wave and boogie woogie flavor. In the 1980s they were led by brothers Brian and Kevin O'Neal, who brought an irreverent everyman sensibility to their music. The original line up included Victor Johnson on guitar, Steve Felix on drums, Gus, who danced and sang and Mike Jones on keyboards. In 1985 the band replaced Gus with Reggie Leon , replaced Mike Jones with Mike Radi and Greg French replaced Kevin O'Neal on bass. The Bus Boys toured extensively with this line up. The Bus Boys produced two notable albums but they are best known for their one minor hit, "Cleanin' Up the Town," which reached #68 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart in the United States (as well as being featured on the soundtrack to Ghostbusters). Their song "The Boys Are Back In Town" was featured in the movie 48 Hours and they were the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on January 29, 1983 featuring hosts Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Reggie Leon has been a member of Sha Na Na for over 15 years and Victor Johnson is currently the lead guitarist for Sammy Hagar.<br>  <br>  They reformed in 2007 under the leadership of Brian O'Neal, and have begun touring again. The Bus Boys have also announced plans to release musically digitally in the coming year.|`|RV5XDcoVaa	I thought Thin Lizzy sung The Boys Are Back In Town?

U0FgxEJxaa	I am not really sure, but could it be Samurai Champloo?  How long ago did your dad rent the movie?  Samurai Champloo (not sure if anyone had long purple hair or not) may be too current and it is a series, not a movie.  He probably would not have rented Ninja Scroll as it may have been to violent for you (now I have your curiosity up, don't I?).  There is an older tv series (not movie) about a Samurai, but he had black hair.  The name of the series is Samurai Jack.  It's an older series, but I still like it.      I am sorry if I was of no help to you!  This may get me some thumbs down, but I couldn't remember any more.  And half of what I did remember weren't even movies!  I hope you find the movie you are looking for!!

JSryPP8faa	WORD!!!|`|AA11404315	I saw them at les scwab theater, I must say...they need to stop giging to pay their mortgage...although the have many hits, they are diminished by their act to perform live with the 2nd generation of studio musicians that have no ruling for thier reputation.                     Icebr8ker  aka(icebreaker)|`|Catsy82Caa	but free bird showcases the guitarists???    hi m an|`|1NVMh8wSaa	As good as they were I feel much differently about them now. I used to like them but then really thought about the words to  "Sweet Home Alabama". I find that the racist hillbilly overtones celebrating the governor of Alabama's refusal to integrate the public schools to be in very poor taste and unfortunately now has ruined the experience of the music for me.  Edit: Its funny how you can listen to a song and love it for so long and then one day you really think about the words and what they mean, then the meaning and image of the band changes in an instant. To elaborate....... "In Birmingham they love the governor now we all did what we could do" and also bashing Neil Youngs "Southern Man" in which he lashes out against the treatment of minorities in the south.

cLTbby44aa	I'm a big fan of ATDI and enjoy these bands as well:     1) From First To Last - they've released 3 albums, all very different from each other.  The first one, Dear Diary, is the closest to the emo style in my opinion. Very interesting album. Their second release, Heroine, features progressive elements, and has impeccable drumming imo. Their latest album features their new vocalist.     - Note To Self (From Dear Diary) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-akyo-zfp...    - The Levy (From Heroine) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Nz1Je89...    2) Thursday : very similar to ATDI     -Understand In A Car Crash http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQPQcQ7jW...    -War All The Time (no video, sorry. lol)     3) Chiodos     - No Hardcore Dancing In The Living Room http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJCX_Nit3...    Other bands to check out: Quicksand, Glassjaw, Finch, Refused, Portugal. The Man (they're a progressive band, and kind of sound like The Mars Volta), The Sound of Animals Fighting, The Fall of Troy.     Edit: The sound quality on some of these videos can be pretty lousy, it might be better to download them or listen to previews on other sites.     http://www.last.fm is a great site for discovering new music.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	.:hedzy:. had some great choices and recommended last.FM.  You might also want to try pandora.com -- just create a station with ATDI and stuff from them and related music will get streamed to you... as you "thumbs-up" and "thumbs-down" what it picks, it quickly zeros in on picking only stuff that you like.  You can also see what others that listen to ATDI are getting into.  I have found tons of new stuff that I really enjoy that way.|`|7RD7cxs5aa	Try Endeverafter.

HB8uby7xaa	They don't want to have to go through the annoying process of checking ids of people to make sure they can order alcohol.  They also make a lot of money on alcohol sales and they wouldn't make any off you.  Sorry buddy.

It was freakin hilarious.

mAzgILpfaa	I am also a Capricorn and i would say a Virgo .. both capricorns and virgos think and act alike.|`|8uXSHWYxaa	Pisces or Cancer! You will have a strong emotional connection with a Pisces and his sex style will give you a sensory overload.A Cancer will shower you with affection and you'll adore he's sexy tough side.|`|KifasiMraa	well, my Capricorn friend ended up with a Sagittarius so maybe you should go in a different direction, ha-ha.  Of course, people are very complex on many levels, so you can't just go by what an astrology book tell you.  That being said, I think a Pisces would work well for a typical Cappy.  Taurus' are stubborn and emotionally sensitive, and a Capricorn's bluntness might be too much for them.  Virgos are nurturing and sensible, but can be critical of themselves and others.  Scorpios are controlling and trust no one.  Pisces are emotional, but intuitive and tend to be really understanding.  They go with the flow, so they'll respond better to your personality quirks.  Plus they like all sorts of artistic things, so you'll probably have some really good and interesting dates!|`|AA11951392	Capricorn is compatible with: Taurus, Cancer, Virgo and Capricorn    Best Match for Capricorn is Virgo    This is destined to be a very strong, long lasting and suitable pairs. Both signs love very similar qualities. Capricorns insistence on being exact and Virgos demands for perfection, these signs will really get along well. Both signs put home and family above all else and their neutral understanding of each others needs make a fantastic partnership.    Worst Match for Capricorn is Sagittarius    When speaking of extreme opposites, these two signs find it hard to agree on anything. The Sagittarian is known to be open, free and optimistic. The Capricorn is sober, restrictive and suspicious. The Sagittarian seems to tire quickly from Capricorns lack of speaking and cold exterior and soon tires of trying to agree and comply in what seems to be a one-sided relationship.    Love & Blessings   Mily|`|fVurmB5yaa	the first answer given was about a Sagittarius... don't do it! I am a Sagittarius and i do not get along very well with capricorns. THE ONES I HAVE MEET, not all are very self centered and competitive. Spare the sag, don't hook up.
tjFcfI9Aaa	OMG im entering that aswell and im 13 here is my advice:    - curly hair  - skinny jeans and stripy top  - sing with no music then add music on movie maker on ur laptop    hope this helps plus i hope to meet you there in the finals!|`|AA11875266	Cool.  I am turning 14 in 18 days =)   lol    Wear a nice shirt - that is very bright: red, yellow .... don't wear white or a light color.   Sing without any music and on WMM add background music, vocals - play around with it =)  Don't wear a lot of makeup. Make it seem real. & for the hairstyle - keep it down or wear a headband (=    Good luck.
xmdh8iY3aa	BUY. I think its his best beat and Gang Starr's best song. My reasoning is Premo took a rare one second sample and turned into into the hearbeat of a 3 and a half minute song. Simple yet complexed.    No matter how many times I listen to it I can never get sick of this  beat. Infectious is the word I would choose to describe it.|`|xUxUwloPaa	I think Mass Appeal is the best song ever.|`|os6FaEBlaa	I'll buy that, it's my favorite beat by Premier too.|`|IFf5r9zAaa	Sell. It's a really hot beat, but I prefer some of these -    NY State of Mind  10 Crack Commandments  When I Be On The Mic  MC's Act Like They Don't Know  Classic ( I REALLY love this beat)  D'Evils  Da Enemy    It's a tough call to pick just one Preemo beat though - he's got such a huge back catalogue. His work with Gangstarr is definitely up there as some of his best.|`|3Q4ijBQOaa	It's one but I would say that Dwyck is!|`|OSPMXwOZaa	Man that is a good question, he has some great beats... I will buy tho it's probably his best|`|LyauFqaaaa	buy. besides that one. i do like alot of his work on jeru's sun rises in the east album. especially the d.original and come clean song.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	Sell|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	I know a lot of people love that beat, and I do too, but I don't think it's his best beat... there are so many that I prefer over it    The Format- AZ  The Come Up- AZ  Boom- Royce da 5'9  My Friend- Royce da 5'9  Hip Hop- Royce da 5'9  When I B on the Mic- Rakim  DWYCK- Gang Starr  Words from the Nutcracker- Gang Starr|`|4DzaDa3Uaa	Sell    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opWYnUpNt...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQxL0U4Nv...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHTx7QhXx...|`|XXMhrJSSaa	You might be on to something there|`|aJfBtT9iaa	Buy, if its not the best its one of the best beats EVER!

I earned them  And all the pictures of me and Em, I burned them  So there ain't no proof that I ever walked through 8 Mile  And since there ain't no Proof, I never walked through 8 Mile  Sometimes I think about my life with my face down  Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile (My Life x3)  Damn, I know his momma's proud  And since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my momma now  And like MJB, no more drama now  Livin the good life, me and Common on common ground  I spit crack and ni--g----g--as could drive it outta town  Gotta Chris Paul mind state, I'm never outta bounds  My life used to be empty like a glo--ck without a round  Now my life full, like a chopper with a thousand rounds.

kZdyPspmaa	Sadly, a lot of rap/hip-hop singers don't really know much about music, musicology, music history, music theory; many don't know or recognize other genres of music and couldn't tell you how it was composed (classical, blues, jazz, rock, country, etc); many don't know how to read music or interpret sheet music.    When I put that together all I see (hear) is a person who writes poetry and can speak it in rhythm to a beat - and oftentimes poorly at best.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	wrong. But a lot of people don't that are in the hood. When funding gets cut music goes first and if there is no teacher kids can't learn music. When people complain that rappers don't play instuments they forget that the reason is because instruments and lessons are expensive and not everyone can afford it.|`|ydl3DNzWaa	wrong|`|8XT1Tvcvaa	I think the more fitting stereotype would be that kids who are 12-17 don't know much about music or instrumental variety, or music theory. And since these people are the main consumers of popular music, most of which today is mainstream hip hop, you're making a deductive generalization about hip hop music.    But either way all stereotypes are incorrect generalizations anyways.     I consider myself a die hard hip hop fan, and yes I know what an octave, a major scale, and a quarter note is. I also play bass guitar and listen to many styles of music. If you think all hip hop is about is gun-totting gangsters who talk about money and women you're much more ignorant than anyone who doesn't know what a major scale is.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Noe|`|KEk728Gsaa	Sorta. But there's always exceptions to a stereotype. Rap is all about the vocals, and rock is a combination of various instruments and vocals. Naturally, people that listen to only rap don't learn as much about music and instruments.    I'm not bagging rap, but this is my honest opinion.|`|os6FaEBlaa	I do, and many fans of hip hop who produce do too.    I actually know many live instrumental rap groups.    So no it is not a fitting stereotype.|`|LELGscJFaa	Denver do you know what 16 bars means?    I'm going to go out on a limb here..    Music is organic.  Songs, Speeches.  Everything is organic.    Real art happens when someone puts down the book and starts doing.    As we do art, then we can pick up the book while we're at it.    Just studying art is stale and boring.|`|4sd4eeBdaa	Isnt an octave 8 notes or something and yes i know what 1/4 of a note is i used to have to play keyboard but ive forgotten how you read basic music, i took music but the teacher  didnt teach us and one of them walked out so i didnt actually have a chance to learn anything , ohh yer hip hop fans are just unintellegent thugs ohhh yeah, thats not true lol im sure most people hardly know anything about writing music or chords and such|`|3Q4ijBQOaa	No. I know plenty. Um, Have you ever heard of the Roots? They are not only perfomers of Hip Hop, but they are fans.   This is a really crazy assessment.    Yes to both of your questions. Even if you don't play an instrument that stuff is still taught in Music Appreciation. Duh. Stop being rude on here.|`|v6a0Hfudaa	sometimes|`|XDvOwLlNaa	Yes it is.    Most rap fans are young and too busy "Crankin That"...they don't even know what an instrument is.    I know tho, I play guitar.|`|LyauFqaaaa	is it fitting for me to say you are a fruity pebble?|`|ll2y4YIGaa	no its not true. some may not, but thats like anything else in this world.]     so you can just shut up!!!    nice try though|`|Ve8Eh9Hlaa	boy you dont have to be a hip-hop/rap music lover to not know what an Octave major is  now i know what a 1/4 note is but hey thats just insulting right here...  go up to any person in the street and ask them that they will think you talking alien to them or something

z3uUtr33aa	omg, i saw that yesterday too and left soooo confused. i don't even know what the ghosts had to do with it, like if they weren't any ghosts it would of made perfect sense still like what did the ghost do? they didn't warn her about anything because she's already a killer but the thing is she was dreaming so much i don't even know which part is really her cause like she was dreaming that her sister was there the whole time and that she killed rachael when really she did and rachael had to have been some type of killer in order for them to think something's wrong with her. but IDK! and i wanna know so i'm starring this question.      haha, sorry i didn't help. i just wanted to let you know that i'm as confused as you are (:|`|ycNt74yyaa	***** Major Spoilers Here, please revisit after you see the movie **** It is totally obvious this movie rips off the best qualities of other good/great movies i.e. 6th Sense, The Ring, The Shining, Fight Club --- But it rips it off pretty good in my opinion... I can imagine a lot of hard core IMDb'ers will poo poo this , but as far as my Friday night at the movies it was money well spent. I knew there would be a twist, and in that knowledge I was watching for it --- Im a relatively smart guy and should have spotted it, but the "twist" was pulled off pretty flawlessly and it did NOT leave me feeling cheated. In fact it was so well done and so subtle. From the beginning to the end we are given little clues, introduced to dialog and characters that when the final revelation is given I didn't feel cheated or that it was a gimmick. In a way I had more of a feeling similar to the end seen in Seven where it wasn't really a twist that you were expected to figure out, but rather just what it was , a revelation of what you were seeing and what the characters motives were. This is not an Oscar contender, but a pretty good movie that if you take it for what it is, a pretty entertaining movie that will leave you thinking about what you just saw as your driving home.      ***SPOILER*** As for the ending, it's a cheat. In my opinion, movie-makers have an implicit contract with the audience to the effect that most of what you are seeing on-screen is real. Every now and then, a movie breaks the contract, and the audience finds out at the end that everything they've been watching is either a dream or a hallucination. (Some of you are old enough to remember that one entire season of the TV show, Dallas, turned out to be a dream.) OK, I admit that once in a blue moon, this type of plot works. The Wizard of Oz is the classic example, but that movie worked because it makes no pretense of being anything other than a fantasy. Most of the time though, when the whole plot turns out to have been a dream or a hallucination, I feel cheated. This is nothing but a lazy plot device that allows screenwriters to put all sorts of weird, spooky, and fantastical scenes in a movie since they know they can explain it all away in the end.|`|P6lFNVtiaa	go to www.imbd.com it should have the plot on it and it will explain alot|`|qJOOq93zaa	Hii :)    The movie is about  a brother and sister move into an old seaside house they find abandoned for many years on the English coast. Their original enchantment with the house diminishes as they hear stories of the previous owners and meet their daughter (now a young woman) who now lives as a neighbor with her grandfather. Also heard are unexplained sounds during the night. It becomes obvious that the house is haunted. The reasons for the haunting and how they relate to the daughter whom the brother is falling in love with, prove to be a complex mystery. As they are compelled to solve it, the supernatural activity at the house increases to a frightening level.    Hope that helped :)|`|3nmBkBvOaa	Here's the plot of the original (A Tale of Two Sisters):    The movie begins with a girl named Su-Mi being brought to a psychiatrist by a nurse. The girl remains unresponsive despite the psychiatrists questioning, until he shows her a picture of her and her family. She then looks contemplatively through the tangle of hair that obscures her face to the window.    Su-Mi is eventually brought home by her father (Moo-Hyeon) along with her timid sister, Su-Yeong, but instead of entering the house they spend the day at the wharf. When they do decide to come home, they are met by their difficult stepmother (Eun-Joo) who busies herself with dinner after they walk away from her.    At dinner, the atmosphere is tense and when the girls are informed their uncle is visiting the next day, Su-Mi leaves and Su-Yeong follows. Eun-Joo sits alone at the table, looking frustrated (and with the pills their father earlier left for her).    That night Su-Yeong awakens from her sleep to find somebody entering her room. She hides under the blanket, but it is pulled from her and she flees to her sister's room in terror. Su-Mi promises Su-Yeong that she will always be there for her, and they fall asleep.    Su-Mi awakens after a nightmare in which a female ghost emerged from her wardrobe and stood atop her bed to find that she and Su-Yeong have begun their period (as has her stepmother). Tensions grow unbearably strong, and when the girls discover photos that reveal Eun-Joo was once a nurse who worked alongside their father a fight occurs. Eun-Joo still hosts the dinner for which the uncle arrives.    During the supper, however, Eun-Joo acts strangely while everybody else sits in uncomfortable silence. When she begins to settle, the silence is shattered by the uncle's wife, who begins to choke and convulse on the floor. It is unclear why this happens, though it is likely an allergic reaction or she is epileptic. While on the floor she sees a strange girl under the sink - she is ghostlike and seemingly decaying. This could also be the reason for the wife's attack.    After being medicated, the wife and uncle leave behind Eun-Joo and her husband. He quickly flees to the bedroom, and she investigates under the sink. She witnesses the same sight. This drives the stepmother to believe that the strange events becoming more and more frequent are because of Su-Mi and Su-Yeong - her suspicions are only intensified after her pet bird is slain and found in Su-Yeongs bed. She goes into a rage and locks Su-Yeong in the wardrobe, and after Su-Yeong is freed the father asks her why everything is going wrong.    She insists that the stepmother harasses Su-Yeeong, but the father informs her that Su-Yeong is long dead. Neither of the girls take this well. Things grow even worse when Su-Mi wakes up to find her sister missing and her stepmother dragging around a bloody bag through the corridors of the house, and beating it. Su-Mi runs to the kitchen to get a knife and free her sister, but Eun-Joo attempts to splash the boiling water from the kettle onto her. A fight ensues and Su-Mi is rendered unconscious.    Her stepmother has a monologue as the girl awakens, and then attempts to kill her by crushing her skull with a hefty statue.    The father reteruns home, having left earlier, to find an injured Su-Mi laying amidst the rubble of a statue. The blood that once littered the house, however, is suspiciously gone as is the stepmother and bag. He sits her down and brings her some medication, but Su-Mi is now the stepmother. She looks up in surprise, and the camera rotates to show the real stepmother, then turns back again to reveal Su-Mi back where she was. She takes the pills.    It is revealed then, that all along Su-Yeong really has been dead, and Su-Mi was acting as the stepmother and sister all along, with severe multiple personality disorder. She was the one at dinner, she was hugging herself that night she had the nightmare and she was beating the bag (which had a bloodied doll in it).    A flashback begins and Eun-Joo (eyeing the father, who is with another woman (the mother of the girls)) enters the home. Her appearance angers the girls, as they feel she is intruding upon them. Su-Yeong throws herself onto her bed, and after falling asleep wakes up shortly after to find her mother has hanged herself in her wardrobe. She shakes the body, screaming, and is crushed to death by the wardrobe.    The stepmother rushes in to investigate, and discovers Su-Yeong screaming for help. The stepmother leaves rather than helping Su-Yeong and comes across Su-Mi in the hallway. She begins to tell Su-Mi about her sister but is coldly interrupted by Su-Mi. The stepmother then tells the hostile Su-Mi that she will regret this moment because she didn't listen to what she had to say.    The flashback ends, and the stepmother sits alone in the quiet home. A noise comes from Su-Yeong's room. When she investigates, the wardrobe opens and from it crawls the corpse of the

PSuBYFSyaa	i HATE comparing the too.  i like pac as a rapper more, but I like listening to Biggie more.|`|nAtBuBRhaa	I think Biggie. He was not just a great lyricist. But if you hear songs like Respect and Sky's the Limit; you just hear his story out. He came from nothing with a dream and a mic. He has one of the greatest flows I've ever heard. Not saying Pac was bad, just not as good. Biggie was good enough to just drop two LP's and still be considered the greatest. That's an achievement that is overlooked by most critics. R.I.P.|`|U5Zz11TEaa	2Pac|`|vS2L7ASvaa	2Pac no question|`|9EdJHqKHaa	Pac|`|7H9gHQA8aa	2pac is much better|`|HHpVBoTuaa	Tupac Amaru Shakur|`|xeEOTsyYaa	I think BIG is better, but i'd rather listen to Pac.|`|OpBFc27iaa	Both, dammit.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	If I had to choose it would be Biggie ...but both are crucial to my music needs..

You are young and have every right to have decent expectations of others..however, I hate to say this but, the older I get the less surprised I am at the behaviour of others ( and I'm not talking about young people but older adults who have, unlike you, given up on being civil ).

azIA2rmRaa	http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/b/bl...    This is the acoustic intro.    This is from Ultimate-Guitar. I learned this and just added a little by myself to make it a little more complete. It's pretty simple but sounds fantastic.     http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/b/bl...    This is the beginning of the "whoa's." With the reoccuring power chords and riff. Again, from U-G, but you can add to it. I used both of these and with a little help from my guitar teacher, I'm learning the whole song.|`|apfnKPpRaa	is that a song!?!|`|rZiaQUi1aa	This will tell you everything
5zNwBQZHaa	Their return policy for music and movies is different than for the rest of their merchandise.  I think that without receipt they will only replace it with the same title (like if it was defective) But there is too much fraud in this area for them to just accept movies and music back.    No retailer is ever obligated to give you your money back - there is no law that states that they have to - so it is up to them to set the policy.|`|9XZe5q6gaa	They probably won't take it back without a receipt. If they do return it, it will be for store credit.

A3GZ3NxHaa	The Show Spaced has them in it     Two movies have been announced with them in it which are "Paul" And "The World's End"     The World's End is the 3rd and possibly final movie in the " Hot Fuzz , Shaun Of The Dead " series     Paul is NOT from the same people who made Hot Fuzz and Shaun Of The Dead ...|`|36cnDKABaa	Theres one coming out called "Tintin"|`|k2yy6tlUaa	the 2 u said and "tintin" is the only one i can think of
RP4Xnu5gaa	Hmm I found out about just by seeing vids on the internet of boyxboy couples and fans posting comments about it and such.    My first reaction to it was "WTF?" But now, I really love yaoi. A lot. Why? Idk, it's just awesome!! :D     But I think part of the reason is because much of the animes/mangas that are yaoi-based tend to be more based upon love and deep story lines that often bring me to tears, whereas boyxgirl is normally more focused on sex, and girlxgirl is nearly always all about sex. Yaoi does often have sex, but I don't find it lustful; it's love ;)|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I was reading Clamp's manga novels that they have created. For most of my life time while reading manga and watching anime, I didn't know what the heck is yaoi. Until later, I read manga with two good looking boys, and I thought they would be made for each other. I started to find pictures of them together, and I thought they're were so hot. I started to have a blood rush, and I started to feel hot in my skin.|`|ruv8C3DEaa	When I started reading anime/manga stories on fanfiction.net.I was somewhat disgusted because fanfic authors were putting details of it in their stories.Some stories were good without it.I still read the stories but I skim through the yaoi parts.*Waiting for the thumbs down*|`|cTA6OmjUaa	i started with shounen-ai first. there was this show i watch when i was 10 or 11 called Yami no Matsuie (still watch/read it) and i loved it. i didnt even know it was shounen-ai until last year.

I said,and I quote"ewwwwwww"|`|AA12222429	I had a friend on livevideo whose profile was covered with yaoi fan icons. From what most of them said, I had a pretty good idea of what it was, but it wasn't until I watched one of her yaoi amvs that I completely understood...  Needless to say, she lost any respect I has for her. The amv was from Loveless, and not only was it yaoi, it was practically child pornography!|`|fawhiGtsaa	It is bad.

RtG5Iarbaa	I always thought it was suicide.. but then one day I was bored, googled up all the controversy, and spend the whole reading about all the proof and stuff that was pointing in the direction of him being murdered. Apparantly that overdose was only called the first suicide attempt after he'd already died. Who honestly know? We never will. But after I've read pages of all that murder stuff about him, it does seem pretty suspicious. And I don't think he'd want to kill himself, he was extremely devoted to his daughter, he just wanted to stop playing music, and bought that shotgun to protect himself..      I had a picture somewhat like that, I'll edit with it. But you can always try just print screening a picture from a youtube video.  ---> http://www.nirvana-music.com/kurt-cobain...|`|w3feYgkCaa	Omg, I love Nirvana and Kurt.  Seriously, He's in inspiration, and if he can be for almost 20 years, he will be forever.  I was shocked when I found out he commited suicide, and I don't know why, but i read his suicide note on the internet and it was shocking.  I don't know if people were gonna smoke his ashes, and I don't know where they would find them, so probably not.  And you can find pictures of him, at www.photobucket.com, www.tinypic.com, or www.images.google.com|`|FTNkG7bwaa	http://bittenandbound.com/wp-content/upl...  http://www.obituary.cc/photos/fallen/kur...    i think they fit!    i think he was blasphemous, but i quite like him, cuz of his song 'beans'|`|gkmZTu0xaa	http://i84.photobucket.com/albums/k26/he...|`|XhJuHMwQaa	"Kurt suffered from a stomach condition -- a severe burning, nauseous sensation, exacerbated by stress -- that no doctor could ameliorate; opiates, Kurt found, specifically heroin, were the only drugs that dulled the pain".   http://www.popmatters.com/books/reviews/...|`|dq23rVevaa	i think he is the most selfish person on earth.|`|7RD7cxs5aa	I think that he killed himself because he didn't want to be that big, he didn't want to be The Beatles of the '90s, but when "Smells Like Teen Spirit" came out it was so huge that they became the biggest band in the world so in a way, we killed him. Also, did you know that they found samples of his handwriting in Courtney Love's backpack along with a notebook full of her trying to copy his handwriting? So maybe she did write the note then kill him, I don't know. I don't know if she's smart enough to do all that but what I do know is that the world will never be the same and that's all because of Kurt...    As for the ashes and the pictures, I doubt anyone smoked his ashes, they said the same thing about Tupac. For pictures try Google images or Wikipedia.|`|KEk728Gsaa	I am not impressed that he committed suicide. I don't know why so many people are.

hnpkooVYaa	YES!  They are apparently starting filmig like now so that it will be out this year at the same time that Twilight was last year. *cross fingers*  The DVD for Twilight is also available to pre-order on amazon:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P5H...    (Just in case you wanted it)  Personally I think Twilight the book was FAR better than the movie, but the movie was still great and had me laughing a lot. It's just they rushed through it to fast and missed out to much stuff.  But I am still REALLY excited! Especially since Taylor Lautner is going to play Jacob again =D  The movie should be great!    And, to answer your question, they have signed on to make the movies of the first three books as far as I know. I don't think the fourth book has been signed on to be made into a movie yet. Personally, I think it would need to be a really long movie or made into two because a lot of stuff happens in it and if they try to squeeze it into one then it would probably ruin it.    Anyway, yes I am very excited!  But I personally like the books best, but still the movie is funny and great.|`|XRwixdqfaa	I cant wait either! i think they're starting making it in march 09! i hope so! loved the movie, kinda prefer the books though|`|IIH6JjDVaa	I think they are!!!!

I cant wait 4 it!!!!!!!!! i saw the movie trailor, and it looked awesome! except i couldn't see if taylor (Jacob) was still in it!!! if he isnt, i'll call hollywood and demand for taylor!    -rilee steff|`|nRhgzFUvaa	i cant wait till people stop talking about gay TWILIGHT!!!!!!!!|`|Z3v9fkpSaa	want to hear something,my name is Bella and people always come up to me and ask me if i'm in love with some guy named edward and im like you guys are just over obsessed fans that need to get a life,i havent't read the books because i dont want to, my sister has the books but i wont touch them, i just dont want to become like the obsessed fans. :]haha|`|x6rHjPIIaa	yea they are!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am soooo excited I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YGMlocIVaa	i can't wait until it comes out!!!!!!!!!    i am sooo happy Taylor Lautner is going to play Jacob!      =)    For more info you can go to:  http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/newmoon_mo...|`|Tp4R14rlaa	omg i read the first page of it and it was HORRIBLE!!!!

Then New Moon will come out around November. And Stephanie Myere said Breaking Dawn may not be filmed, but they are just gonna wait for New Moon to come out to think about that.
DAyIxMnyaa	I LOVE Charmed...so i guess i like all of them =]  I prefere Piper, Phoebe and Paige to Prue...I think that Paige made Charmed more funny, and thats what i love about her... and Charmed.

And so as my fave actress is Alyssa Milano, Phoebe was my favourite with Paige and Piper in a close second.

I like Prue too, but like i said...Paige makes it more fun.  =]|`|u2EUom6daa	i used to love Piper (holly marie combs) she was so funny in Charmed i also liked her gift when she started being able to blow things up and she was walking around the house with oven gloves on so funny xXx|`|RKMxAKDIaa	piper is my fave and my best friends fave too coz she has leo mostly and she is the funniest and her power rocks! i love charmed ! i got my best friend loving it too! x    Drew fuller is soooooooooooooooo incredibly hot!|`|AV65vgQFaa	piper.  but paige is a close second.|`|2mA5SuPtaa	It keeps changing.

3BLnUnnQaa	hi there,    I suppose it's a CD that someone made for you, because as far as I could find out the lyrics comes from a song called "Wolf Tickets" by The Click  http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=US&v=uJm...  (lyrics are on the right under "more info", check out the first verse after the chorus)    Mike Dennis.
NO7yEh8caa	Probably not. Studies were done in the late 50's and early 60's regarding just your issue. The studies found that while the mood swings were alleviated, it was only furthered by a generation of Bi-Polar adults. It seems the the constant repetition of up, down, up, down, up, down instilled an emotional condition the mimicked the very action. And that was just the swings. The teeter totter...well...the results are too horrific to even think about.     The round about, or circle playground device was also found to be quite destructive to developing minds. Instead of lateral thinking, the vast number of children developed a repetitious and circular mentality. Many, if not all, went on to become politicians.     I believe, strongly by the way, that the most instructive portion of the playground is the sandbox. With certain modifications of course. I have trained my children with just that. While watching them mindlessly moving sand about, I realized that that in itself was not a way to properly prepare a child for the adult world. Hence I had them use the litter box as their own personal playground. Not only did it keep the cats deposits cleaned out, but it taught them that what ever one did in life, there was always the threat of stepping in or digging up an unpleasant surprise.     I can say that my children are not only well rounded but wary too.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	This keeps them on such a merry-go-round, doesn't it??

AA10289523	the Joker has given up many chances to kill Batman.

Joker himself has said if that there was no Batman, than life wouldn't be as interesting.|`|8ohAAwrEaa	If batman was dead, how could they make money?    The joker is CRAZY.  Part of being crazy is doing things that make no sense.|`|USoCUVeOaa	The Joker thrives on chaos and Batman's sense of duty and his sense of a moral code that he follows is an affront to everything Joker stands for.      The Joker believes that deep down everyone is truly like him and tries many times through his elaborate schemes to prove this, thinking he can force other people's hand to do evil.    He would love nothing more than to make Batman break the code he has made for himself and attempts this through those elaborate schemes.|`|ZAnDf4vraa	Because the Joker isn't trying to kill Batman. He's trying to make Batman break his one rule, which is to not kill anyone.  Hope this answers your question.
oGlkH2wYaa	Phil of the Future was cancelled in the Fall of 2005 at the end of Season two. As far as we can tell, there was no single factor that caused disney to cancel the show, but rather a variety of factors. These included Alyson Michalka's Mother wanting a pay increase for Aly, Scheguling conflicts with Ricky Ullman's other projects, Aly & AJ's (then) new singing carear, and issues related to ratings. Since the orginal cancelation, Aly & AJ's new series fell through, Ricky made a rucus with the WeBee Boys, Amy Bruckner left hollywood, the sets where torn down, and Disney channel hit a new stride with High School Musical.|`|AV65vgQFaa	disney limits the amount of episodes a show can have.  maybe they reached that limit.|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	I DONT KNOW but i know why cory in the house got cancelled..cuz he got maria walsh PREGNANT i know right!|`|pLW8RrORaa	the actors grow up too, are you still taking t-ball

iMyY5uCHaa	you need to get the exact frequency of the glass and hold the note for long enough. and it doesn't shatter all cinema style, it just chips a bit.|`|msvCztNGaa	Yes|`|bjdSKkvCaa	yea look on google or youtube and type it in you will see its crazy|`|LdhTl7acaa	This was proved on Mythbusters a few seasons ago.

Lol, like on harry potter when the fat lady in the portrait smashes it on the wall!! xD|`|ZbEF9KoXaa	yes you can but it's impossible because it's unreachable, that is why thay call it the unreachable note.|`|NiAGP4vdaa	I think so!

LdhTl7acaa	A good beginner exercise is "busy bee." Start in C Major and, from the fifth, descend to the tonic while singing, "Busy, busy bee." Continue ascending in scale until about an octave above where you began, then descend all the way back (you can keep going if it feels comfortable until about A Major).    Another is two "yoo's" in a row: Starting in C Major, begin at the tonic until the fifth with "yoo," and descend. Then, without breathing, take it up to C  Major and repeat. Then you may breathe and continue ascending until the octave above where you began. You may switch to "yoo-ah" during the higher notes wherever it feels more comfortable a free. Then descend back to where you started. You may continue until about A Major, again only if it's comfortable.    I would suggest asking a vocal teacher to show you a few if you can find one near you.    Edit: These warm-ups are more specifically for females, especially beginning sopranos.|`|vcGydoTaaa	you can do scales or do the "mommy made me mash my m&ms, i cried" up the scales. thats it!|`|nMmN6dJTaa	First go up the scale saying, do re me fa so la te do  Then say buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz  Then mommy mommy mommy mommy ma ma ma ma  Then bubble bubble bubble bubble gum gum gum  of course always go up and down the scale|`|AkLZ9A0Yaa	You need just to practice on the your note  like from higher note to lower note!  Don't get nervous just forget that you're singing in front of people  just think about stuff that makes you feel calm    that's it, hope I was any help  Good luck

The music from our past is often overlooked and forgotten.  The voices are pure and "original".  If you are into soft music you may want to search for Jazz as well (not Blues).  If you enjoy Rock or Pop, I suggest looking into Doo Wop or Rock and Roll as far back as you can find.  If you do find yourself interested in these types of music, you can look for hits of 1940's to late 1960's.  If you discover early Rock and Roll to be your style, that would fall under 1970's to 1990's, I believe.

KVfxa6Coaa	my favorite band is our last night    there screamer is my age ( 14 )    the entire band started with a raggedy drum set and crappy guitars and now they are famous    they like to not be in the limelight and they are very mellow people who are as ordinary as anyone else
SkRJNhuCaa	no, you need to replace it with a new one.  And if you don't know how to do it, ask your teacher of ask in the store where you buy those strings.
KEk728Gsaa	It'll probably be the same genre as the older albums but not nearly as good. AIC without Layne Staley isn't really AIC.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Their other albums are widely considered to be hard rock/heavy metal. I guess they wound up with the grunge label cuz they played in Seattle alot in the early 90's.    I'm thinking it'll be great no matter what label is on it. Jerry Cantrell can write great music.

a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	I recommend satellite, with a few caveats.  You have to have a clear unobstructed view of where the satellite is to get a clear signal, so if there are trees, tall buildings or mountains in the way there will be problems.  There are sometimes problems due to atmospheric interference.  I've found that DirecTV loses signal less often than Dish, but that could be a quirk of our geographic location - we had a better angle to the DirecTV satellites and therefore a stronger signal.  But Dish had a better deal on the HD DVR so we decided it was worth it.    We've tried cable, digital cable and FIOS, and in all cases the image quality was worse than we got via satellite.  I have no idea why and was pretty disappointed in this.  We tried switching to FIOS in September and had high hopes, but between the botched install, the six hours on the phone with tech support and the image quality problems we just gave up.|`|bTbYP3iyaa	dish|`|iu4SOin3aa	We have Comcast and it works really well.

Do not even bother with them!    No competition. DirecTV wins!!    But if you are open minded for other providers, I would RECOMMEND Dish Network!! You get more for your money with them pretty much. Basic rates start at $19.99 for 60 channels and if you get the TOP 250, it's still at a great price ($49.99/mo.) That's about the same price as Time Warner's basic rates.    Jessica!! - I bet the Comcast commercials told you that didn't they? We had a NASTY storm and the Dish still kept going while with Cable, the service went out when it rained. Sometimes even when it was sunny!

AA10994784	I think he burned it because he said basically this evidence will go to the same people that cover this stuff up, and it will be forgotten anyhow or twisted.  It didn't necessarily prove him innocent as much as it proved the Senator guilty, at least that's what he thought.    Killing those 400 people was a serious crime against humanity, and the Senator basically green lighted the whole thing without ever being blamed, Swagger was just using that as leverage to get his girl back.    It was also his unit that he was with in the military that actually did the killing, so in  effect, he was tied to that without knowing...|`|P6lFNVtiaa	he burned it hopeing that nobody would see that it was him it was too cover up his tracks, but the reason he killed everyone is there was an oil line under the village and the people there would'nt let them dig so thats why he killed everyone hope i helped

On the night of September 7, 1996, that was tupac's death!     More info:-    Shakur attended the Mike Tyson - Bruce Seldon boxing match at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. At 10:55 p.m., while paused at a red light, Shakur rolled down his window and a photographer took his photograph. At around 11:00-11:05 p.m., they were halted on Las Vegas Blvd. by Metro bicycle cops for playing the car stereo too loud and not having license plates. The plates were then found in the trunk of Suge's car; they were released without being fined a few minutes later. At about 11:10 p.m., while stopped at a red light at Flamingo Road near the intersection of Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their right side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the two women, and invited them to go to Club 662. At approximately 11:15 p.m., a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with an unknown number of occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side, rolled down one of the windows, and rapidly fired twelve to thirteen shots at Shakur. He was struck by four rounds, with bullets hitting him in the chest, the pelvis, and his right hand and thigh. One of the rounds apparently ricocheted into Shakur's right lung.

It's now cool to be into Twilight, thus the seven million Twilight Teenieboppers who saw the movie first.|`|70ihksK5aa	well if i never read the book, i would think it's not bad movie (i did read anyway). try anyway|`|UT6Vi1WSaa	The books were better...|`|LVzgunnMaa	i never watched it.|`|OIjhFSzjaa	The movie is okay. I liked it but the book is deffinetly much better. They took out a lot of things and didn't put a lot of things in and only did like 7 scenes out of the whole book but you should see it because everyone has a different opinion. There are the haters and the people obsssed with it but you when you see it you'll have your opinion and know for yourself. watch it :]|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	The movie has horrible direction, worse acting, and an even worse following.    The only reason this movie has made so much money or fuss is because of tweens that have obsessively watched it over and over. They only watch the movie because of the "hott" guys or actors in it. Not because of the quality of the film, which it obviously it is not.    Its kinda like backstreet boys and nsync, crap music, but they were successful because of hormone enraged girls.|`|2mA5SuPtaa	It's not that great. I hear the books good though.|`|hDCXGRV6aa	It was okay.|`|Lpe0sz7xaa	I personally thought the movie was kinda cheesy and the movie left out a couple of important parts that were in the book. It was a good movie but not 5 stars. I saw the movie twice with my friends and they didnt read the book before, so they were kinda lost. but good movie, effects are BAD! lol (:|`|x6hfvTX2aa	The books were absolutely better, so if you also thought that the books were good than i would tell you to go see the movies. I am still getting over how good the book was and how almost true the movie was.|`|BpzhRxTzaa	It was ok. I absolutely LOVE the books. They are amazing. But the movies was disappointing. The special effects sucked, the actors sucked, and they changed WAY to many things in the movie. And its annoying to watch the movie because every girl screamed when Robert Pattinson came one, who may i add is not that hot! Jacob, now he is hot =] lol. And kristen Stewart didn't even smile through the whole fricken movie!! She is Bella, she smiles when she sees Edward AND SHE DIDN'T!! overall, it wasn't that great. But I'm sure I'm like the only teenage girl who thinks so....|`|YKdz6vpBaa	the book were better that the movie but the movie is not that bad.. the just left out a lot of thins from the book.. that is what makes it bad i think but is good to watch the movie that way you can give a face to the characters in the book...|`|1fIQXPP5aa	Its not that great  you  can tell how low budget it was    i liked how it was towards the end, the fight scene was done well    it's not much to rave about.|`|t81qLSOnaa	most people i have talked to have said it is good. Its a different kind of film...not ur typical trash like Pineapple Express or Stepbrothers or Cloverfield...those movies..wow...i cannot even define my hatred for them..Twilight is a more indie type of film that is quite enjoyable if you're into fiction. If you're not into fiction and prefer true stories i suggest you save your money and dont rent it. As for me, I enjoyed it...i do not regret spending my money on it becayse it didn't suck..but yes..i t couldve been better. i suggest you finish the books...now those are very well written =)    hope this helped!|`|54a1161155ecf8d89d51a995fa7ef406aa	it WASN'T good.  it was so bad that i cried when i got home.  i wanted to leave half an hour into it.    the movie suckedsuckedSUCKED.|`|vI3Ihd6gaa	The books are usually always better, i enjoyed the movie though because it gives a face to the characters in the books =)

My hugs are more addicting than nicotine.   teheee(x|`|bcNXFqR9aa	I LUV hugging ppl too! there's nothing wrong with u. it's just that u like showing ppl how u really feel bout them. |`|KBUPMW2Yaa	I understand where you're coming from with wanting to hug people, because humans long for connections with other people...but personally, I only like hugging people that I'm really close to like really close friends and family.    If I just meet someone I don't really like hugging them, cause I feel like I have to get a bit more comfortable with people that way, so I would just be aware that other people might not feel the same way as you do about hugs! :)    But yeah...when I do hug people I love it gives me such a feeling of comfortableness and being loved, it's incredible!|`|6Bj1ySrhaa	I rarely give a hug unless I get so much excited but my friends like to offer me a hug for each hi and bye so I have no way other than being victim of their kindness:)

qsuYKa3naa	In a way it is wrong, especially if you have an understanding with the person living in your home. What you might consider snooping they may not & that is why it is so important to set ground rules when letting someone move into your home.  I would tell the person, "My bedroom is off limits to you, period".  I am not sure any rights, per se, are being violated, but it does make for an awkward living arrangement.|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	Yes. My room. My stuff. If someone else is in it without my permission then I have to assume they are up to no good.    However if it's a parents or legal guardian snooping in a kids room then I'm fine with it. The parents/legal guardian pays the bills and would be the one to get in trouble if something illegal was going on in the room so they have every right to know. Anyone else is a no go.|`|3MOT3R0naa	totally, it is bed private area, so get off|`|ASlr8RKbaa	"James knew he had to go. But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|ZKFhlHhKaa	Privacy?|`|LiOOF1Plaa	This is one of my biggest pet peeves. Call them on it....Your privacy is violated, every time you are away.

I live with a 94 yr old woman (a friend's grandma) who SWEARS she NEVER ventures into my room, other than to cover my parakeet's cage or lay my mail on my bed. However, she knows when my closet door is left open (which, btw, she cannot see from the doorway & she's half blind anyway), ahe turns my light off next to my bed if I should happen to leave it on, and when I went out of town, she taped a "Traveler's Prayer" to my TV screen. But, NO - she hasn't been in there one bit!! LOL    Thanks for letting me vent - I feel better!!|`|ONWCXzUMaa	If it's a parent then, yes if the only thing there looking out for is your well being, then I say yes. Just to look and be nosey no. And if it was a friend or someone else then they would have to pay the price, an on here I can't say what that price would be.  take care  dave|`|dYyiG90caa	Not so much whether it is Right or Wrong.

dYyiG90caa	"How the Gods Kill" (1992)  .|`|capSLZQXaa	His first, self-titled album. "Twist of Cain", "She Rides", "Am I Demon", and "Mother". It's hard top top that!|`|waGFlfRUaa	Here are my top picks:    1. Danzig  2. Danzig 2: Lucifuge  3. Danzig 3: How the Gods Kill    It kind of went down hill for me after 3...  I also have the following:    Danzig 5: BlackAcidDevil  Danzig 6: Satans Child  Danzig 777: I Luciferi|`|DibFrwxlaa	III|`|7fEVNng5aa	Lucifuge|`|tPMsaf7Haa	Lucifuge.|`|UFE7BJHBaa	Danzig is a man-lovin' sissy . I'm more into The Misfits without him|`|hNOGWLCzaa	Danzig II : Lucifuge    so far...|`|lGzQtEH7aa	My favorite Danzig album would probably have to be his first self-titled album Danzig. That album has my favorite Danzig songs : Mother, Twist of Cain, Am I Demon, She Rides.Great album, but I think Danzig was better when he was lead singer of the Misfits, its a shame Danzig is not with the Misfits anymore though, they would have lived on forever...oh well.
AA11442722	Woody was born for that role. Normally Woody's acting is well wooden. In that role he was perfect. Juilette Lewis, she SIZZLED in that movie. The plot laid there and was the first victim of the killing spree. I usually like Stone's movies. Wasn't especially impressed with this one.     The violence was sensationalized. The attempt to isolate it to it's bare elements failed miserably though. Yes there are people who kill to kill.  John Wesley Hardin would have been the best role model for Woody's charactor. They were outlaws not serial killers. There is a big difference between the motivations and behaviors. The body counts might be the same but there are no historical precidents for outlaw serial killers prior to that movie. There have been some copy cats I suspect but they tend to get caught rather quickly.     Serial killers by deffinition blend in. They are the upstanding citizen who nobody suspects of anything. Outlaws often go out in a blaze of glory but rarely kill without purpose. Killing is incidental not the purpose. Stone attempted to wed serial killers with outlaws and the result looked like a cheap slasher flick with guns. This destroyed the suspension of belief necessary to really get into a movie and enjoy it. The sheer levels of violence were actually not all that much more than an old school Western. The body count slightly higher but I've been watching quite a few old Westerns and was surprised to see higher body counts than even many slasher flicks. The primary difference is more the special effects than the actual level of violence.     What was totally missing was the consequences of violence. In some of the old Westerns you at least got to see a mourning widow or something. Today they are redshirts. Once dead forgotten.     So I think the movies impact on society is minimal because of it's unrealistic treatment of violence. The lack of a causation itself robs it of power. It was just one of the more sensational of a whole genre of movies that continue to be churned out today.|`|207dFmdHaa	I think its one of the best films ever made. Woody was unreal, no one could of played the role but him.....violence, media, isnt it the same thing really?|`|vK9Vv9gjaa	very entertaining, woody is a great actor and the whole serial killer thing he just hit it on the head. great movie|`|dYyiG90caa	Brilliant !!    The Last Great Oliver Stone Film IMO --    Since then He has just "Repeated" the Devices and Editing Ideas, used in this Film and "JFK."    It's Commentary on the Media and Civilizations Fascination & Numbness to Violence, were Well Presented.    There is a Much Lesser Film -- But worth a "Look" --     S.F.W. -- Low Budget and deals with the Same issue of Media, but has a Killer Soundtrack.  .|`|ONWCXzUMaa	woody at his best, a movie I watch over and over again, it has so much to say on all levels, his speech in the prison as the riot is going on , it one of the best things I've heard in a movie.  take care  dave|`|5uvTte8Zaa	Inspiring|`|ccBNNA5paa	One of the best but I heard it would have been alot diff. if Quentin Tarantino would have directed it.

5pixuieFaa	I think Cook's character is interesting! He's charming but rebellious! I think he could surprise us in many ways and Pandora may get a boyfriend and change..  BTW, I know cook and Effy in real life lol!!!!|`|8v5ZtvF2aa	i think Freddie will get in crap because of something Cook does.    Cook is a right tosser so i wouldnt be suprised|`|ipdM8Sefaa	cook will get into a load of trouble with that Johnny gangster dude but freddie will save him.  freddie will sleep with effy  JJ and pandora will lose their virginity... prob not with each other but that would be interesting lol  twin 1 will disown twin 2 for being a lesbian  the blonde one who was once thought to be a lesbian will prob get in on with cook, who is a idiot... but what can ya do?|`|fnCbVvaoaa	Well, as we have seen last episode, it has come out in the wash that Naomi isn't a lesbian and it is actually Emily. Cook will be the one who is always saved by Freddie and we will see a darker side to JJ. If you don't already know, a new boy is coming to the cast in upcoming episodes called Merveille Lukeba, he has just moved over from Africa and doesn't have a clue about British life. I think we will also see a different side to Pandora.

aqLDMy2Maa	you can use a brush to get dirt off and a damp cloth damped with water and hand clean the boots.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	If they are cowboy boots they are just like your four wheel drive truck.  You don't clean them...it looks like you mean business!!    If they are regular boots you put them on the cabinet next to the sink and get the water coming out of the faucet real real warm.      Now, get a brush (not the one your mom/wife cleans potatoes with, but a different one- maybe her hair brush LOL  and dip the brush in the running water and then wipe off the boot till most of the dirt is gone.      Then take a dish cloth and put dish detergent on it and kind of give the boots a 'bath' without soaking them...just keep the water running and going back and forth between the water and the boots.      After that just put them in a warm spot - (top of the refrigerator is nice and warm) and let them dry overnight and maybe into the next day.      After they are all clean and dry, you might want to spray them with something - like polyurethane or something made for boots.    OR....    Tell your oldest son or your little brother that if he can clean them up till they look good as new, you will give him a buck apiece.|`|f5VXq3T0aa	Uh.. what kind of booties?|`|SdReR6Ycaa	to clean your boots either use alcohol with napkin and clean.

Plz4T3fzaa	"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"    ... There's a scene where the hobbits are hiding underneath a tree, and then a giant (and ominous) black horse suddenly appears above. It's a truly unexpected image.    ...|`|AA11563731	Back when THX was a brand new thing, the movie "Gatlingberg" came out.  It is a Civil War movie that portrayed what happened there.  There is a scene where one army was lined up behind a row of cannons and they shot them off one by one, right down the row.  There was about 20 cannons there, but I wasn't counting.  I was busy looking around for the CRASH, KERBAM, BOOM!!!  behind me!  That was the very first movie I went to that had a perfect surround a sound effect, due to the THX system.  When the scene changed, everybody in the theater cheered because the sound effect was so awsome!|`|AV65vgQFaa	the scene where danny is killed in american history x gives me chills all the time.

POqwp3Fiaa	Everybody on earth dies and goes to heaven. God comes and says, "I want the men to make two lines. One line for the men that dominated their women on earth and the other line for the men that were dominated by their women. Also, I want all the women to go with St. Peter."     With that said and done, the next time God looked, the women are gone and there are two lines. The line of the men that were dominated by their women was 100 miles long, and in the line of men that dominated their women, there was only one man.     God got mad and said, "You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created, you in my image and you were all whipped by your mates. Look at the only, one of my sons that stood up and made me proud. Learn from him! Tell them my son, how did you manage to be the only one in this line?"    And the man replied, "I don't know, my wife told me to stand here."|`|1ZfkQBg3aa	Jokes|`|Lj0xwPmraa	Most modern inventions were in the 20th century.     *vacuum cleaners - 1901 by Hubert Booth  *air conditioning - 1902 byWillis Carrier   *instant coffee - 1909 by G.

iFeJJGlMaa	Sorry but I love this one, I know it's long but it's funny!  Ok, there was a blonde, a brunette, and a red head. They were all on a plane. The brunette had a banana, the red head had an apple, and the blonde had a bomb. So the brunette threw the banana down, then the red head threw the apple down, and the blonde threw the bomb down. When they got off of the plane, they saw a boy crying, so they went up to him and asked, "little boy, why r u crying?" The little boy said that a banana hit him on the head. Then they saw a girl crying, and they went up to her and asked, "Little girl, y r u crying?" The little girl said that an apple hit her on the head, then there was a little boy laughing.

Feeling somewhat  hungry, he sat down and looked over the menu...     + Tourist: $5     + Broiled Missionary: $10.00     + Fried Explorer: $15.00     + Baked Democrat or Grilled Republican: $100.00     The cannibal called the waiter over and asked, 'Why such a price difference for the Politician?'

(assaulted)    two men walk into a bar. the third one ducks.    These two cannibals were eating a clown when one of them looks at the other and asks "does this taste kinda funny to you?"    A string walks into a bar and the waiter says to him,"We don't serve your kind here." So the string goes across the street and tells a friend to tie him in a knot and fray his edges. So the guy does it and the string says thank you. Then the strin g goes back across the street and goes into the bar and orders a beer. Again the guy says we don't serve your kind, but the string says,"I'm afraid not."(I'm a frayed not.)    An old couple were watching television one evening. The wife said "I am going to get a dish of icecream". The husband said "I will get you some ice cream". "I'll write it down so you don't forget" she said. "I won't forget" he said. "But I want chocolate syrup and nuts on it so I'll write it down" she said. "I will get you the ice cream don't you worry" he said.

God comes and says, "I want the men to make two lines. One line for the men that dominated their women on earth and the other line for the men that were dominated by their women. Also, I want all the women to go with St. Peter."     With that said and done, the next time God looked, the women are gone and there are two lines. The line of the men that were dominated by their women was 100 miles long, and in the line of men that dominated their women, there was only one man.     God got mad and said, "You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created, you in my image and you were all whipped by your mates. Look at the only, one of my sons that stood up and made me proud. Learn from him! Tell them my son, how did you manage to be the only one in this line?"    And the man replied, "I don't know, my wife told me to stand here."

They were among the first rock and roll stars. To me, the song is about when the music of your youth changes.  For me, it would be The Beatles, the Stones and such. I was pretty much of the Woodstock generation.|`|ox4MdqcVaa	The day Michael Jackson became popular.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	End of 90's|`|qAZpWHKMaa	It never did....  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ8miTErh...|`|cYtHoGaVaa	I'm pretty sure it's still alive and well..

Richardson "The Big Bopper" all died in a plane crash on February 3rd, 1959. That is actually the day they classify as "The Day The Music Died". So i hope that answers your question. And in "American Pie" by Don McLean, it isn't a metaphor, it's actually about this day that the plane crash happened.|`|pkiUlvOAaa	December 8th 1980 at around 11:07...

0b4636305e45b187a8f16d18854d3459aa	And at the begining of the show during Simon's introduction when he says something like "..and he made Brittany Spears cry. He's trying to steal my job!" So ironic in retrospect.    I adore Simon. He is just so adorkable that no matter how mean what he is saying is it still just seems cute and cheeky.     After watching a few more Mark eps I've started to appreciate him a bit more. I like how he will often get up an mess around with the contestants and the line-ups. And I found it a tad eerie when on an episode where Simon was a guest, Mark gets up and hugs him while yelling "Me and my boy!"     Another ep I recently watched was the one with Donny Tourette and one of the Holloways. Donny was kind of an ***, I but I feel I should give him some credit because they were being pretty harsh to him but he was still a good sport and mostly laughed it off. Though that might have something to do with the fact that I'm pretty sure he took some sort of substance when he dissappeared for a few minutes.     I liked a few episodes.       * Have a Good Day *               ~ Don ~

When the director found out that it was my third trip with TWA they picked me to interview for the commercial.  It played on original Travel Channel which at that time was not all that common on cable stations.  Although the commercials ran, I never got to see it. I got a call one day from a friend from Virginia all excited because they saw me on TV.      My 15 minutes of fame lasted about as long as the airline.  They were already selling their prime European land slots to American Airlines which swallowed them up eventually.  .|`|HlmSSeZdaa	i was on a local kids show with a clown named "sammy b. goode." in the mid 80's|`|ePNoC11daa	yes 2 years ago because a sheep started to live in our school field so the radio station and the news came to our school and i had to do an interview!

They sense when people put their socks in the dryer and they sneak in through the vent in the middle of the night singing songs of toe cheese and steal random socks in order to cause chaos in the world.  Also they are funded by the sock industry in order to keep people buying sock.

The 'ritual' that we're speaking about is just a oath to speak the truth, and placing that 'oath' upon something you hold dear.  If your religious, the bible.  If your a scholar, a academic book.

Also, "A Lonely September" by Plain White T's is a very sad song.|`|ZOtaloy0aa	domino- varsity fan club  babysteps- varsity fan club    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOpUT4Gag... - domino    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IP6idi8AO... -babysteps    i love these songs. not sure if their a crush song or being heart broken, but i know that they are love songs xD|`|ZaozdFlyaa	uh i dont know but by the title, crush by david archuleta|`|uuHI16gRaa	love story by taylor swift|`|a0EeYueWaa	Basically all the artists you've listed.

But I already did that in July when I was still 17 and never went back|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I had a job and my lead didn't want to give me vacation, I took one week in the fall and had another one coming to me, I told him I would be better off quitting and taking my savings and going to California and living under a pier, taking a sink-bath in McDonalds and begging for handouts. At least those people don't have to work like slaves and not get their vacation. He told me he felt the same way sometimes too (even though he always took his vacations) and let me take a vacation. He didn't know how many times I thought of that while I was working.|`|AA11514493	sigh  there have been times the only thing stopping it was..    I'm too damn lazy to get out of my chair.

It would probably be fair to say that right now, the thought of running away to warmer climes probably crosses my mind a few times a day....and I often think it would be great to run away from my job, too....at least for a little while.    Maybe there are times when I am *on* the job when I have thought of running away every half hour....but I am only there for two hours each day....and I seem to have noticed recently that the time goes fairly quickly....though not *always* as quickly as I would like.    I am sure that if I were married with kids, my take on this Q might be a little different!

AA10867564	depends. a person who has bad social skills thinks being all blunt or all disenginuous works for all situations. however, what is really important is to be able to read the situation and apply what is necessary.    overall, in my experience, it is far better to make other people like you than to act the same way all the time and hope they understand what you are doing.|`|54a1161155ecf8d89d51a995fa7ef406aa	bad for the mostpart.  unless it helps the person. but being blunt  just to be mean? badbadbad.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	i think it's good|`|w63Ry3w4aa	Depends on the situation and/or the person(s).

But being blunt isnt always a good thing, depending on the situation.

There is ways to say things without being too harsh.|`|2hF4zUE6aa	It`s a GOOD thing|`|AA11593592	it really depends on the situation|`|AA10500537	good at least the person knows what you think|`|1IGXttyaaa	pass the blunt, sista|`|qhU3PDgfaa	james blunt's songs are very good..lol    but other than that.. the person who is really blunt..should take care before talking.. coz he / she might end up hurting someone badly..|`|ij9N9r5waa	It's a good thing as long as you don't hurt an-others feelings in the process.

It never ceases to amaze me the things they have no shame in asking ... or sending!! Could I describe what am I wearing for them, do I like going out without underwear sometimes, can they see my collection of intimate photos, can they send me theirs, do I have rape fantasies, how do I like to be dominated, etc etc ad infinitum. And then there's the ole erotic descriptions of what they'd like to do to me. The ones who start out like that actually aren't too bad - their motives are blatant and you can either block, fail to respond, or bore them into oblivion. The most difficult ones are the ones who start out seemingly nice, and really quite appealing. But if you're ever naive enough to give out your IM or private email address, their motives become progressively clearer ... and then comes *those* photos ... eww!|`|KTtLYrcZaa	nope but this one time some hoe from y!a sent me an email just saying FAG FAG FAG..... i was really pissed!!! >:(|`|Zbrg4q7baa	yeah, an email=)|`|0QsXsFzwaa	Yeah, an email.|`|yACXwSuhaa	I don't know that many people on the internet...so NO....|`|juraRlbkaa	OMFG, yes!

41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	I won't patronise you, and tell you what to think, but here are a few questions:    Why is there no video of a plane hitting the pentagon?    How can this happen: a 47 story building, not hit by a plane, falling at free fall speed, symetrically, every column, every beam, every truss, every rivet, failing simultaneously on every side of the building.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD06SAf0p...    Once you get it, there's no going back.|`|e0CLBKqJaa	no way.|`|G4qG1Zakaa	Of course it was. Anyone who thinks it wasn't is a complete idiot. The American media did a good job at brainwashing the public.    I watched it live that morning and when they show the crash of flight 93 at first they said there was no plane just a hole in the ground. They soon stopped saying that when the propaganda wheel started turning.|`|O2suF9O4aa	Another 30 million brain cells just died.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	maybe. unsure. but people need to stop asking this. it's getting annoying.
o5aHZ1Xdaa	Habeas corpus...    And it really depends on what you mean by "we."    In the final hours before adjourning in 2006, Congress passed and the president signed the Military Commissions Act (MCA). In doing so, they cast aside the Constitution and the principle of habeas corpus, which protects against unlawful and indefinite imprisonment. They also gave the president absolute power to designate enemy combatants, and to set his own definitions for torture.     If you are like me and conceder "we" to be anyone in the US or who is being tried by Americans in an American court they yes, "we" have had our habeas corpus rights seriously compromised by the MCA.    Now, if you are one of those people under the illusion that they could never possibly be labeled an "enemy combatants," someone who thinks that all Muslims are, in fact, all "terrorists" who don't actually deserve fair treatment, and that what happens to "them" is of no concern to you the answer is: no. i guess you can sleep well at night knowing that YOU will never be removed from your home and family, locked up indefinitely, given no charges or trial, tortured.    i, for one, cant really sleep peacefully knowing that this could happen to any of the "we" i claim allegiance to, i.e. Americans.    -Shamar|`|07YBD5mJaa	Habeas corpus (/'he?bi?s 'k??p?s/), Latin for "you [should] have the body", is the name of a legal action or writ by means of which detainees can seek relief from unlawful imprisonment. The Suspension Clause of the United States Constitution specifically included the English common law procedure in Article One, Section 9 which states:   The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.   United States federal law affords persons the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Habeas corpus petitions are generally argued as ex parte cases. Individual states also afford persons the ability to petition for habeas corpus pursuant to their respective constitutions and laws when held or sentenced by state authorities.  During the Civil War and Reconstruction and during the War on Terrorism the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus was substantially curtailed for persons accused of engaging in certain conduct.  It should be noted that the privilege of habeas corpus is not a right against arrest, but rather a right to be released from imprisonment after such arrest. If you believe you are being arrested illegally, and refuse to come quietly rather than petition the court for a writ of habeas corpus, even if you are correct in the belief that the arrest is being made without legal merit, you are still guilty of resisting arrest. If you believe you are being imprisoned illegally, "tell it to the judge."                If you read through this article, it kinda tells you more about the recent status of it. it talks about the suspension of it and all. hope this helps!|`|LiOOF1Plaa	You have a corpse?|`|pkWX3rbPaa	whats havious corpus?    as far as i'm concerned we only have habeas corpus...|`|pKtS3rJ5aa	what is havious corpus?...............do you mean habeas corpus?|`|bwx3epFdaa	It's habeas corpus, and it still exists.

There was this one passenger who I was going to help and "go above and beyond" the call of duty for but then he was being so insulting to me and using such foul language(it's one thing if they're saying i hate your airline or you cancelled my flight now i'm screwed but he was trying to personally insult me.  I don't get paid enough for the way he was talking to me.) that i was like "No this is all we have.  Can't help you."  That wasn't really the worse part.  As fate would have it, I was in the bag chute and his bag was right there by it's lonesome probably waiting to be rerouted.  The reason why I noticed it is because he said his bag wasn't the typical black rolling bags everyone has. I inspected it further to make sure it belonged who I thought it belonged to and sure enough it was going to the same destination as said passenger and had his name all over it. No one was around so I took the liberty of taking off any identifying nametags on it and made sure it would never see it's original owner or the us again.  It was just such a coincidence that it was where it was because it really should have been in another part of the holding area stacked away with another 150 bags going to the same destination.  I'm not saying it was the right thing to do and it's the only time I really tried to screw someone over and that guy had really important things in there but I don't feel guilty about it.  I'm a believer in Karma and when I saw that bag I just thought "unfortunately for some people karma's a *****."

There's one particular time I had a really eerie feeling about walking down a certain street one night, and I followed my instincts on that and chose a different direction.

PmadQI3iaa	i enjoy flyleaf more. because it has a lot more rock than paramore.   the lead singer of flyleaf, lacey has such a unique voice. It's really nice.  she screams, and she can pull it off. And her songs have deeper meanings of faith, and love and the future. She's been through a lot in her life, and she still survives. its kinda inspirational. Flyleaf goes to countries in Africa and sings there. Its just that they give back. i just love it sooo much.I know paramore is more popular, but ehhh... i listened to the (Paramore) riot cd and the flyleaf cd. I like the flyleaf way more. And the girl in Paramore sometimes sounds squeaky.

They are all  pretty good songs.|`|speJXeIhaa	Candle in the wind , the Princess Di one.Gets me every time.|`|fkG4cflhaa	Nikita  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9wBEA_PY...|`|JXh3FrDdaa	tiny dancer!!|`|HlEU7lNGaa	It's raining men.|`|govN3EESaa	can you feel the love tonight|`|1hXr0z2Daa	the one with the piano.|`|7eVJgRzIaa	i wud have to say candle in the wind that was done for princess diana's funeral|`|rVDyWMVsaa	"Your song",it was his first hit and the only one that i have ever liked!.|`|eGSRdeWKaa	Your Song|`|6uRWoIjJaa	i think he did circle of life...|`|Gc2q9XIPaa	hmmm i like the old one's. daniel is good but my favourite is .........discovery where he sings about the birth of his brother - that really is fantastic shame i cant remember the whole of the title, i like holy moses too - the ballads are far better than the upbeat one' s in my opinion. rocket man was good at the time too.|`|08cYUAW3aa	Crocodile Rock :D and Candle in the Wind....|`|1f8ea7869328e33f16042fd2ed2ceeb7aa	I heard Rocket Man in a shop yesterday and it is truly beautiful.  Also think the words to Goodbye Yellowbrick Road are good, and Guess thats why they call it the Blues is lovely.|`|wz1z8Kesaa	Someone saved my life tonight  The Lyrics had real meaning and the melody fitted it perfectly.|`|DhWYkpm5aa	I guess what's why they call it the blues|`|ea446a7f9fbb186accd5f0153f52cf54aa	Its gotta be Rocket Man.

I love him!
cqIoQH8daa	Can be stunning and fresh; Big Fish.  Can be haunting and eerie; Edward Scissorhands  Can be ridiculously hilarious; Beetle Juice :)  Can be good, but messy; Sweeney Todd  Can be colourful feel-good classics; Charlie and The Chocolate Factory|`|ne2sEeLJaa	I think they are a bit weird, like that Edward scissor hands. That was the strangest film I have ever saw. lol  But I do like his films though, because they are unusual.|`|f43be0279e4f60717eb598a32d93faa0aa	Normally very enjoyable..but the Planet of The Apes remake...not his finest hour!|`|10otv9j4aa	I know hes doing Alice in Wonderland with Helen Bonham Carter, Matt Lucas and I think Johnny Depp is in there not 100%|`|dCbIHBpGaa	I like his stuff but I think it would be nice to see him do something other than a gothic fantasy film just for once. According to the IMDB he has "alice in wonderland" in post production and is due to start work of "frankenweenie". Alice looks like it will be good for his fans - depp and bonham-carter are both in it. More details here http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1014759/|`|aYNoQvfMaa	He's makes the exact same film over and over again, they don't even look that different. He always makes film about loners that are placed out of there element. I'm mean you tell me the difference between Edward Scissorhands, and Sweeney Todd, in appearance. I'm so tired of going to see his films and then just seeing the same thing I saw last time I was at the theatre, he must really have the most forgiving fanbase in the world.|`|a6f1adc3e857cef18f7615f6ae435f72aa	I think he's one of the best, most iconic, directors - you only have to look at a still from one of his films to know that its Burton because of the visual styling. Sometimes you watch other things (Pushing Daisies springs to mind) and think it looks Burtonesque, which is the mark of a unique directorial style.  I've loved his work ever since I was about 4 and first saw Edward Scissorhands.    He's doing Alice in Wonderland next (starring - surprise surprise - Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter).

cYsPx9sSaa	skins has gone shameless, not as shameless as shameless but shameless none the less|`|x0f4RlKoaa	i was just watching an ad for skins and thought it was shameless when it first come on!!!|`|AA11504809	I don't think it is. I loved series 1 and 2 of skins and miss all the people (that's only natural) but I like the people in series 3 aswell (especially effy, pandora and cook), episode one was hilarious, 2 was bad, but that's only 2 episodes, there is more, hopefully they'll get better. only thing in common is cook is mad like everyone in shameless and both programmes were created by the same person.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Skins is bloody awful now. Effy and the shy twin are the only good characters. The script is awful, its trying too hard, and the funny stuff really isnt in the slightest amusing. The exploits in episode 2 were just taking it too far. I wouldnt keep watching it, but Effy is such an awesome character (and hot), that I'm compelled to.|`|d55f9fa303ffed7693f24381e6799502aa	I don't watch Skins, but Shameless is a great programme, I missed the first series and my sister said to watch it, I bought the first one on dvd and never looked back. I can't wait for it to come on now.  The characters remind me of some of the scum on Jeremy Kyle show.

5b218420f6e58d52278efc9527f29a95aa	Drop a lot of acid.    I'm kidding, don't do that. I have no idea how to write a really good piece of rock music. I love music, but I can't write it to save my life. I guess my best advice is to not be me.    Decide whether you want the lyrics to fit the music, or the music to fit the lyrics. Or if you want lyrics at all. That'll at least give you a starting point.|`|2wpPrmibaa	the rock is created being inspirited not by asking others how to do|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Find a subject that inspires you or that you feel strongly about, then write about that =]|`|cYtHoGaVaa	No one can tell you how.

What I do is I have the peer2peer program Ares, which has a pretty nice selection, and I'll download a song. Then I will use my AVG virus checker to check each song before I even play it to make sure there are no viruses.    It works well! For the most part I never get any warnings from my downloads...the risky area is if you're downloading movies and most definitely software.    You might also try bittorrent...using the same virus-checker habit.

0Ei3ePJzaa	I think when you eat or drink too much it possibly is possible to get the hiccoughs.|`|hUYaaXBvaa	it's a more 'innocent' symptom of drunken behavior|`|eZltpbHeaa	puking all over the place and/or getting violent wouldn't look good on a kids cartoon lol|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Lol at the first answer|`|SwKPJRNvaa	it often happens in reality- particularly if you drink stomach fulls of beer after a meal.  I get it when i'm pissed too|`|MVZ6Mpa1aa	You had me at hello 'hic'  lol|`|C3tVKFWuaa	Because in real life we get hiccups, when your lungs don't get enough air. Then making us Hiccup. When you eat or Drink, you don't breathe. So that means the "cartoon" characters, drink to Much, causing them not to breathe, equaling Hiccups! ^-^|`|hGFrwtgzaa	People hiccup when they drink too fast, perhaps when they hiccup in cartoons it's for this reason?|`|5F4trnKqaa	As a cartoonist, actor, writer and animator I can answer this question quite simply.  In real life there are a few things guaranteed to make people laugh; those being someone falling over or tripping or even bumping into something; a silly laugh and an unstoppable hiccup when tipsy or drunk.    Cartoon characters are usually 'slap-stick' based and an exaggerated hiccup, especially when it is accompanied by a dramatic movement (ie: every time the character hiccups he launches himself into the air and bumps his head on a low branch) can generally ensure that the majority of the viewing audience will find it funny.    Live actors play drunk in different ways. The way we are taught at Drama School is to try and pronounce every word spoken very carefully, therefore more slowly (as drunks try to make themselves understood, knowing that what they have consumed effects their speech), and to slightly cross our eyes so that everything is out of focus.     Such subtleties would never work with a comic cartoon character so everything has to be exaggerated.|`|c9nICPlDaa	Because the real reaction is too nasty to display on public television.

nosUH6SUaa	haha parties are a lotttt of fun  depending on the space you have in your house for these people there are tons of games you can play....    if u live somewhere where its warm outside then utilize the weather and get outdoors and play some fun games that way...    but if u live in the cold weather then maybe going outside wouldnt be a bad idea either, if theres a mountain or something around you guys could all go skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, or TUBING(i did that for a party and we all had a lottt of fun)      if u are inside tho and have a good amount of space then (im guessing its co-ed ...but idk?)  you could have the guys leave after a certain time but the girls sleep over. decorations are always really cool and show your friends how nice everything can look(also make shure wherever you haev the party is decently clean)       http://parentingteens.about.com/od/party...     this website kind of has a step by step what to do when planning a party sort of hting      whenever we have parties theres normally guys and girls and we all jsut hang around and different groups of people play different sorts of activities, like some might be playing guitar hero while everyone else is playing pool, it all depends on what you have available. but always make shure that you have music playing no matter what you are doing.    http://www.party411.com/gameguide.html    http://www.bluepineapple.com/partygames/  http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/Party/games...  http://www.partydirectory.com/games/    this has a list of some good party games      another idea if u dont want to have it at home is maybe everyone going to the movies, it might be a little to expensive tho.    make shure that your party has a general theme which can help with decorating, invitations, some of the games, the cake, the snacks, etc.    mostly HAPPY BIRTHDAY and i hope that i could help a little       [:|`|OZxv2xPKaa	You like Fall Out Boy?

76AMUhZnaa	i believe that if you have it you can show it, but in a respectable way because some of the people around dont want to see it. but i also believe that you should keep your body private for you partner. but mostly that if you have if great but if you are going to show it off then do it in a way that respects yourself as a woman and that respects everyone else around you. you know???|`|2c3rcQRbaa	If you dress and act like a sl*t then that is exactly how you are going to get treated.   Women who do this are the same women who b*tch and moan about not finding a decent guy.    As a lady friend of mine says, "if it ain't for sale don't put it in the display case"|`|vweoheAvaa	I'm not saying that a girl with curves should dress like a hooker, but I certainly won't complain if she wants to show off.|`|tqBy3vXvaa	Save it for your partner. I'm pretty sure you're artner won't want you leaving the house looking like a hoochy mama and single. Plus it's gonna make you look desprate and slutty. So you should save it.|`|rU3H3EOzaa	"keep your body private for your partner"  Its about having respect for yourself and for your partner if you have one.Why would you want to get treated like a cheap piece of meat anyways?You might think It's "cute",but when you flaunt,to guys you look the same as all the other females walking around showing their junk off.How much respect do you think they are going to have for a woman who walks around dressed sl*tty?Of course they're going to say It looks good,they get to stare at your body(how nice)and they are hoping to get you into bed with them.|`|r6oi1HyZaa	hang on, still have to make sense of this, sorry!! lol    probably keep it private for your partner, it shows that you respect not only your partner but yourself.  And you can still dress fashionably as well.  It sends a mature image of oneself.      if that makes sense?? lol|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Flaunt it all you want, just do it respectfully.

There's nothing wrong with being proud of your body. I'm not saying go around half naked in stuff, but there isn't anything wrong with showing a little of your figure. Obviously you want to keep certain things for your partner only. But that doesn't mean walk around in a f*ckin trench coat.lol|`|nqlk9iUCaa	If you've got it Flaunt it|`|jUEoujN2aa	yeah, but flaunt as in not like if i was muscular i wouldn't walk around town flexing my muscles but rather walk to the corner shop shirtless|`|wD57Iaxeaa	Definitely the second.|`|bnGnE58zaa	dress comfortably|`|440fe6d001fab4a74217d83f7ee67715aa	Well, I think it's a mix between the two. If you've got it, you should be proud to show it off but you shouldn't show ALL of it off, where the second part comes in. There are parts of you that only your partner should see.  And I agree that you can still be fashionable without having a plunging neckline or whatever.|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	Keep it private for your partner.|`|FdqCnU03aa	Keep your body private.

JovtfAfaaa	Wow. It's very good, great melody. It reminded me of dancing or of a bull fight. I think he needs to add in a grand pause though, right about the 1:38 mark, he should take a pause and then start in again.

U5Zz11TEaa	Bob Marley lived to be 36.   Michael Jackson is now 50.    You do the math....    Bob Marley's music is a universal language. He sung about LOVE, UNITY for all and FREEDOM.    Michael Jackson sung about a Thriller night , A Gold digger named Billie Jean and How he wants to Rock with You....    Within the short time Bob lived he impacted so many around the world    Yes, Michael Jackson happens to be very popular but he doesn't match up to Bob Marley.    Bob towers over his Pop music.|`|P9K7AYmWaa	No he made a bigger impact. remember thriller sold 705 million copies NO artist has ever beat that|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Not as far as I'm concerned. First of all M. Jackson has a different sound. Some things were o.k., but for me Marley was in tune with himself. And reggae has always attracted me much more than Jackson's stuff.|`|a955299a310a71175625cded5cea1a76aa	Not so much on music, as he has on dance and the mentality that you can come from nothing to be a superstar. All it takes is practice.|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	No but he made an Impact on how all possible dangerous Pedophiles in Hollywood can get away with violating underage little boys|`|LkN5nr6faa	Yes, hence his nickname being the king of pop. Marley and Jackson are both regarded very highly in their respective genres.|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	I would say so.  Albums like 'Thriller' and 'Off The Wall' had a huge influence on the 80's music scene and beyond to todays R&B.  Bob Marley was popular in the 70's but reggae didn't dominate the music scene of the time, Punk/New Wave and Rock being far more popular.  Personally I would rate Bob Marley above Michael Jackson, artisitcally, personal taste.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I think so, maybe a bigger impact.    If you throw out all of his personal issues, and make it about the music, then I think he did more than Marley.  I don't know, maybe it is me, but I think Bob Marley was a tid bit overrated.  I know that word gets thrown around a lot in this section, but it is what I think.    Michael Jackson took the whole pop scene and revitalized it.  He stood out completely in a genre where there are probably the most artists are, and he just took it by storm.  Bob Marley did not stand out near as much as Michael Jackson.  He was in my opinion, probably the best in his genre, but he didn't do as much for it like MJ did.

Chorus     But I can't shake it, and I can't take it,   I still love you no matter what I do,   I can't hide it, Lord knows I've tried it,   I've got a bad case of lost my baby blues.       I look at the doorway when I hear somebody walk in   hoping you'll be there, to take me back a gain,   all a lone in this bar room   with the laughter and the talking,   honey, you don't know how bad it's been.

AA10614209	One visitor can visit your page more than once.  Those numbers mean that your page has been visited 342 times and was visited by 200 different computers.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Tough question.    FF.net doesn't really explain what hits and visiters are. If it was only visiters, it would be better.|`|FdqCnU03aa	ooh. when I started last month I was super confused too...    Visitors are the number of different people (users) who visit your story, or a particular chapter, ONCE in 24 hours.    Hits are the number of times people visit your story (or another chapter) AGAIN within that 24 hours. (When they refresh, it counts towards this total, I think.)

My point is, we can "see" the sky just like we can see one another, so really, the air IS visible. (ok, so if you want to be technical about it, air doesn't reflect light like we do... it refracts it, but close enough :P).    Good question. :)|`|PvlbqhlPaa	since i was 4|`|cKbeUeUeaa	Duh !!!

aeODdMATaa	I wouldn't say hot persay but he is a cutie.|`|tOF7ZGhwaa	Personally, no - he's handsome but not my definition of hot|`|ooyYAiN0aa	when you ask twilight-related questions, and especially about someone's hotness, i think you've already anticipated what kind of answer you will get|`|vIQvJpTsaa	OMG yes!!! the wig he has to wear is so weird but he cuts it off in new moon. He just put on 26 pounds of pure muscle since twilight ended so he could play jacob in new moon. HE IS A GOD!!!!|`|UmAM1cW8aa	Yes of course !!!!!!!!!!|`|euwI5KiHaa	when his hair is long   YES!|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	I think he is really cute!! In Twilight I couldn't really decide becasue of his stupid hair!! Even though I am Team Edward, I still love Jacob.|`|a0Qcx9oKaa	Heck yeah, like when i went to go see twilight  the first night it came out, i was the only one in the theatre to scream when Jacob (Taylor) came out, everyone else screamed for Edward|`|S2dM6AANaa	oh yeah i think he is.he has a nice smile.|`|vR6AwIppaa	god no!  thumbs down, i don't care.  he's ugly!|`|k5PFq58Maa	Twilight is dumb.|`|vKrWrhQeaa	not really  he's good looking  but i don't think he's hot....  kellan lutz is better|`|RpEP0biLaa	do u honestley have to ask...YES TAY LAUTNER IS  A AAA SEX GOD (inside joke on fb) i think hee looks sorta erid w/ the wig but he cuts it off in new moon and hee gained like 26lbs of PURE MUSCLE!! hees totally hot and like ammaaazing  and like soo down to earth|`|HnT1ZK0Baa	Nope.

AKVQNGcOaa	It can be hard to block if you don't see it coming. Although, I would be more likely to punch a guy than to slap him . . . but slapping IS a pretty good move. Anyways, to block it you can jump back, catch their hand, slap them back, take it like a man, cry, run away screaming, or just stay out of slapping range.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	Some girls are easy to block, yes I've seen that.

wU0c3i7baa	When he said "I don't like children at all" in that interview, he was basically saying he's not a pedophile. He gets hit on by underage fans all the time, so I think he was basically just telling them that he's not going to date one of his 14 year old fans, whom he considers "children."    I, as a girl going on 21, would be more age appropriate for him ;)    I think he likes kids otherwise...in a platonic way.|`|PmgQC0ptaa	yeah he does because he is ugly|`|YDUZdUMHaa	Wouldn't be surprised with screaming fan girls everywhere.  I've heard it too, but I don't know for sure :]|`|pQBjqMkoaa	yes theres a video of him saying that    i think he was saying that so little pre teens wouldnt obsess over him and tell him they want to have his babies and other weird $hit|`|hqjJV70Eaa	No one but Robert really knows the answer to this.  He made a remark in interviews about not liking kids, but no one knows if he was serious or not.  Because he was talking about dating maybe he just doesn't want to date someone with kids.    Anyway, he's the only one who can really answer this question.  All the rest of us are just guessing.|`|ZxbMgSWIaa	i herd this:He ment he doesn't "like" kids,like romantically.haha.I was kind of angry too because I LOVE him,I really do.lol.I am 11.He cleared it up and it was meant in a romantic way.lol

bXL9937haa	Most likely he will tell you. However, if he is not that type he will show you by affection and attention. Aries are very blunt and determined when they know what they want. I have a feeling that you will know when an Aries is interested.|`|Xih1LWuLaa	They're very aggressive.|`|k9gp11PMaa	He'll be flirtatious one day, then the next day he'll act like he dnt like you, that's if he's really into u. If he's interested, hell flirt w/ u big time. And if he's a teen Aries, he'll flirt w/ u, then tease u.|`|94zi1LFFaa	oh you will know when an aries is interested... he'll start looking at you like he wants to eat you up from head to toe. he start poking fun of you with sarcastic jokes while smiling & staring you down... you might also notice a huge bulge in his pants...      have fun!

XF1ctbrkaa	Nothing comes to mind except Hans Christian Anderson.. not sure that's going to work for you.. well.. maybe you could try The Court Jester .. (it's more of a renaissance faire type theme for a wedding, but.. could be interesting)..    I don't recall a whole lot of fairy tale movies from the time period.. the next step up is the wizard of oz..    Ok, with your add on:    Try Queen Christina  Peau d'ane   The Thief of Bagdad  The Princess and the Pirate (this one is fairly easy to find, and stars Virginia Mayo.. )  You could try The Swan with Grace Kelly)  even Roman Holiday with Audrey Hepburn could work

She will look back at this and all the other videos and laugh one day, asking herself was this really what she wanted to be seen as?  She probably will be a good public speaker one day, but I don't know what else. She comes off as shy, but not so shy.  Funny, naw, maybe compensating for something she feels inadequate about but that is about all I can see.
uD9vEwP3aa	I think you should go to the small co-ed highschool. I mean, life isnt going to be seperated by girls and boys and although all girls might prevent distractions, that's just not how life is. You need to learn how to cope with those distractons.    AND, although it is a sucky campus, there might be some really hot guys!

99bd966c7128c1d9a029f3a0e433e089aa	Man can yaw answer the question doe?    Anyways, I think they sayin' that either because allhiphop.com favors 50 cent or because like most everybody knows 50 cent is the bigger "star".    I hope that answers your question.    But yeah here's my take on the beef...  Both 50 Cent & Rick Ross got sketchy backgrounds & in my opinion both are some fakes. 50 Cent fell off after Get Rich or Die Tryin' & Rick Ross is the biggest fraud that we seen thus far. In my opinion these ****** are SO fake, no one will ever win this battle just because I don't even respect these rappers enough to even take time out to listen to their disses. As for the suppossed Wayne vs. Eminem beef that was supposed to have spawned off this one. I really dnt think theres gonna be any retaliation about what Wayne said during his interview. I really couldn't see them battling, **** I bet they end up getting on a song together matter fact. But yeah thats just my whole take on the situation.    -Peace|`|aJ3Y8J0jaa	IDK I BEAT HIM UP ROSS !!!! RICK ROSS AKA ME I AM THE GOAT!! FORGET RAKIM AND NAS THEY R SWAGGER JACKERS YA DIGG!?!?

(50's video response)    i'm glad fifty's gettin at rick ross.rick ross is wack! he claimed to be some kind of drug-kingpen when he was lyin'. he was a corrections officer!!! it's been out for a while, but i honestly did not why these other rappers didn't say nothin'. i hope 50 gets rid of rick ross once and for all like he did with other prior rappers.

ecIirWlCaa	It's tough not knowing what type of song this is going to...rhythmic symmetry, how your word choice and delivery works with the song, etc....but just as is, it's really good...i like "i would die just to make you see something good in me.." It's obviously honest...which is the most important thing.     But personally, I like lyrics that use some metaphors (things you can compare your situation to), or are visual, rather than literal. They help to draw the listener in. Sometimes when lyrics are too basic they can come off as common and sorta corny. Lyrics should be insightful, thought provoking, and inspiring in addition to giving us something to relate to. There may be more colorful, compelling ways that can more accurately convey what you're trying to say. Check out the verses to King Of Pain by the Police. It's an oldie butta goodie.    p.s. to answer your question at the end, yes you're trying to hard lol. If you show some poise and integrity, you'll automatically command more respect from him.|`|roFGlldOaa	This is great! I can't believe this. I can totally picture rocking out to this song!|`|cgyTWMw1aa	well, you cant tell if a song will be good just by the lyrics.  i mean, if you sing it bad, itll be a bad song|`|5afcdb50c7139ca5f8f48bf62d348d82aa	pretty good, but a touch too depressing for me.|`|p5ijOOodaa	This is amazing!!! |`|ChVk3VJEaa	I think that is AMAZING! That is definitely a song I would buy. What kind of song is it? (Like what genre) Do you write songs for a living or is that the only one you have written?

rp6EEjECaa	Lol, Tupac is great, he's so amazing! Even drunk he can bust out an amazing freestyle, that's true talent right there. And look at how long the freestyle is! The video is almost 6 minutes! 6 minutes to straight freestyle, that's insane, it takes a lot of stamina to rap for so long and I don't think I have ever seen such a long freestyle That's crazy, the man is a legend.     But I have to wonder: a lot of rapper's get high before they rhyme and it helps them do that but do you think that being drunk helps you rap and/or freestyle better? I wonder...Tupac may be on to something big here.|`|ebvNEvj1aa	...Wow...And people say he couldn't freestyle..honestly wtf. Tupac FTW.

The series is of the romance comedy genre, with scenes in the story being for comedic purposes.    The female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year high school girl with no special qualities who has a crush on Oji Karasuma, a stonefaced eccentric. The generally clueless Tenma finds it difficult to confess her love to him. Complications arise with Kenji Harima, the male protagonist and a delinquent, who has developed a crush on Tenma. He too has difficulty confessing to her. The attempts of the two characters to confess their respective loves are running gags seen throughout the series.    As the series progresses, the story changes focus to the relationship that develops between Harima and Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, which results from various embarrassing situations involving Eri and Harima. Harima also develops a relationship with Tenma's younger sister Yakumo Tsukamoto, who begins to assist Harima with the development and drawing of his manga.    As the story progresses, Harima gets himself into romantic situations with Tenma, the relationship between Tenma and Karasuma progresses, and Eri's and Yakumo's bonds with Harima grow stronger.

	i dont like the him.  well, their OK, but just not for me.    i think their too overrated.|`|	I heard them before I knew of any fans of theirs, so I had no expectations. I'm not a huge fan, but I like their music, and when I'm in the mood for some mellower stuff as well as a few harder-ish songs, they're good.  Awfully boring band live though, don't waste your money|`|	Yeah !   I thought they were going to be all screamy.   But their songs are very beautiful like you said.   It really surprised me! :D  I love the song This Fortress Of Tears.|`|	I thought they were satanic at first! HIM.... the Devil? lol|`|	haha, same here!   My friend is in love with them, so i looked them up, and I was like "whoaa..."|`|	NO.    sounded better.    dark light is one of the most amazing albums ive ever heard.|`|	i dunno man, i found out about them because years ago (before they even released a single in the states) i listened to international music stations. i heard one of their songs and was like 'hey, this is kind of nice, who is this?" so i looked it up and found out about that band. i like their older stuff more than the newer stuff.|`|	"James knew he had to go. But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|	well, the first time i even new they existed was a few years ago at a friends house. he's actually not goth/punk/emo, or what ever. he's actually skater punk, but listens to A LOT of different styles. he put a burned CD in the player and told me to listen to a certain track. turned out to be "wings of a butterfly". i was freaking in love with the band ever since, with them taking my  2 slot for my top favorites (for the record, A7X is my top ^^ )
1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	She was pregnant! Didn't you see all her flashback? Her throwing up at the club, her looking at a pregnancy test that showed a positive?    She was pregnant with twins, that's why the demon started going after her all of a sudden. Remember the twins experiments they did in nazi germany that they showed?    Her mom was supposed to have twins, but only Casey survived. Then Casey got pregnant by her boyfriend, that's when she started having nightmares and seeing the demon everywhere.
V7D1DUizaa	I'm pretty sure they were in allegiance with the Capulets at first, but because the Nurse loved Juliet so much, she realized that Romeo, even though he was a Montague, was a great person, and she agreed to help them.     Not really sure about Peter.    Hope this helps! :)|`|AA11658197	best as I can remember they are neutral|`|uD9vEwP3aa	Hmm...I'm trying to remember because I did this a long time ago...The Nurse and Peter are apart of the Capulet family...I mean the Nurse cares for Juliet and Peter works for the nurse.

RzH9P7lWaa	the uninvited has some pretty good scares but overall its the best movie becasue it has a very intricatley woven plot that will astound you. you definetly wont see it coming.  its sooooo worth seeing    the unborn is dumb as s*** it isnt scary its doesnt have a point it just keeps going. its a waste of time and money|`|yqKi9l9laa	i asked the same question and people said the uninvited. my friends recommended it. i'm going to see it tonight!|`|T7uUZvA3aa	THE UNINVITED|`|a71t2nW9aa	the uninvited by far and ty for the 2 points|`|54a1161155ecf8d89d51a995fa7ef406aa	haven't seen either.  but i'm gonna guess that The Unborn is scarier.  I've also heard that it is really scary lol.    The Univited looks good to me. Like, I'd see  it. Unlik The Unborn, which I would never see.|`|qPIsxtPDaa	I would say the uninvited. It has more detail & is the straight up probably scarier. But it deapends on what .. you know.. how scared you get (: lol|`|AA11852352	Uninvited!!! It is much cooler than the unborn. The unborn sucked.|`|OXeCOSg5aa	huh|`|5wARwhe9aa	The Uninvited.  The Unborn was a waste :]|`|ac2f5ef06e68bf5831f356893ee96effaa	one is your basic stepdaughters v. new stepmother thriller, the other is about an unborn thing who opens a portal to hell or something.  kthxbi.|`|q2E9XIQRaa	the univited.because the unborn is about a girl who's mom had twins bu one died while still in the womb.the univited is similar it is about  a mother who died and her husband's girlfriend is after  her daughter .now which one sounds scarier to you ?|`|bLQhabEzaa	I think the unborn is gonna suck cause it just has things runnning around with upside down heads and the girls twin brother died as a baby and is coming back in the form of an 8 yr old when shes like 17. I think the uninvited maybe scarier with more suspense.|`|76d0abbc40ad30a74af455c65255de81aa	the unborn was horrible.  dont see it.|`|pEpet2ioaa	uninvited! totally!|`|76SAdZ19aa	http://www.uninvitedmovie.com/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uninvit...      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unborn_...  http://www.theunbornmovie.net/|`|R5d4cGATaa	Uninvited much scarier.|`|jVQ58AMFaa	my friends all tell me unborn!!!!!!!!|`|4nnzWvWGaa	the uninvited.  more intense then the unborn.

He was the 46th Governor of Texas from 1995 until 2000 before being sworn in as President on January 20, 2001.    Bush is the eldest son of 41st U.S. President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush. After graduating from Yale University, Bush worked in his family's oil businesses. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and unsuccessfully ran for the United States House of Representatives shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the Texas Rangers baseball team before defeating Ann Richards to become Governor of Texas in 1994. In a close and controversial election, Bush was elected president in 2000 as the Republican candidate, receiving a majority of the electoral votes, but losing the popular vote to Al Gore.    Eight months into his first term as President, the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks occurred and Bush announced a global War on Terrorism, ordered an invasion of Afghanistan that same year and an invasion of Iraq in 2003. In addition to national security issues, President Bush attempted to promote policies on the economy, health care, education, and social security reform. He signed into law massive tax cuts, the No Child Left Behind Act[3] and Medicare prescription drug benefits for seniors, and his tenure saw a national debate on immigration.[4]    Bush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator John Kerry in 2004, garnering 50.7% of the popular vote to his opponent's 48.3%.[5] After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated criticism.[6][7][8] In 2005, the Bush administration was forced to deal with the apparent failures of its handling of Hurricane Katrina. In December 2007, the United States entered the second-longest post-World War II recession,[9] and his administration took more direct control of the economy, enacting multiple economic stimulus packages. Though Bush was a popular president for much of his first term,[10] his popularity declined sharply during his second term to a near-record low.[11][12][13][14][15]|`|Y28IMQfWaa	Look in the Taylor Swift lyrics thing and read the questions and then the songs in order and it was really weird...

La Bamba|`|tSX9wMBEaa	"James knew he had to go. But when he got to the boys' bathroom at school, he sat down on the toilet and nothing happened. He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|jVQ58AMFaa	im sorry thats too long. shorten up|`|79b2yM3saa	Haha awesome survey!|`|qEH9dbT9aa	HOW TO PLAY:  1.

YVaD1huSaa	it wasn't very good. the singer isn't completely HORRIBLE, but the other two were terrible. the song is bad, too, so it wasn't a great tune to attempt.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Constructive Criticism?  The original sucked and you have the audacity to ask what I think of the cover?|`|c7MRFJGXaa	it's lacking a bit of oomph, if you get what I mean. it's too simplistic. that song needs more than that.

That opens up a lot of doors, though, for a lot of musicians. With the internet, many artists can be heard without having record deals. Smaller concerts will be more intimate, but bands won't be able to tour as much. There will be fewer huge festivals, which I think is a good thing. The economy and the internet really level the playing field.     Also, new technology... who knows what will come out of this Autotune obsession? And so many artists now are crossing genres and just doing some crazy @ss **** like Li'l Wayne, who was Spin Magazine's Rockstar of the Year. Globalization is introducing so many new kinds of music and that music is affecting groups and artists that are already established here in the US.     I think 09 will be a year to pay attention to music. Things are shifting and there's no real way to tell what's going to happen, but I bet it'll be pretty damn interesting.

Fa4BahPgaa	Since they're musicians, their music is just about the whole reason people don't like them. Why else would you not like a band? Their looks? Orientation?    Hate's too strong of a word. People can't hate someone unless they know that person and their lives or life of a loved one has been negatively changed due to that person they hate.        And BTW to the person above me, their music sucking IS a VERY valid reason for not liking a band; it's the MOST valid reason. Them not sucking is your opinion, too :-)|`|kHY0eMVraa	1. People like you who don't know good music. Who try to get people like me who knows good music to like them  2. There fans are annoying   3. They're gay!  4. They wear skinny jeans when they're not skinny  5. I don't like there style of music  6. They are annoying  7. They have no talent    Everyone has there on opinion deal with it if we dislike them.|`|VWpmbf2xaa	i like but hate them at the same time. and they actually can sing and have good music. the only reason they're annoying is because their on disney and have annoying fan girls, thats all.|`|PmgQC0ptaa	there gay when they sing at a concert joe and kevin jonas act really gay there ugly, stupid. ugly hair and clothes and they hate there fans(im not there fans)|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	UGH! THIS QUESTION IS ASKED LIKE 50 MILLION TIMES A DAY. USE THE SEARCH BAR!    I hate them because:    -They sing like constipated platypuses giving birth.  -Their horrible 'style' I mean NEON SKINNY PANTS? Nothing gets gayer than that!  -The fact that they're just a few among the bunch of Disney Channel products made to drain teenage girls of their parents' money  '  AND LOTS MORE. There. I answered the question .ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?!|`|9dAcLvijaa	i dont hate them|`|5NBV7i5Gaa	Their music being terrible is good reason for not liking them because it should be first and foremost be about the music. Teenage girls don't like them for the music. They like an image, a brand that they can consume. I think once these girls have more exposure to music they will have will see what good bands are and that the jonas brothers do not fall into that category.|`|IpFgrkJAaa	The haters can never give a good enough reason. Oh well, someone's got to hate! I love the Jonas Brothers especailly Joe!!|`|eykNXMzOaa	joe and kevin look goth and emo. they wear wierd skinny jeans and always black. nicks hair is really bushy! and nick is dating selena gomez ewwwwww! they think they're sooooooooooo cool!!!!!!|`|gWXjNa4gaa	people, I don't think it's very fair to say u hate them cuz they're gay. that's not cool at all. someone's sexual preference is no reason to dislike them.  also, altho u can say u hate thier music u shouldn't say u hate them. truly, none of us know them well enough to hate them. we just hate their music.  and yes, i also hate their MUSIC. why? it's just not the kinda music i like, that's it, that's all|`|DTW0704Faa	I don't hate them.  =)  I hate the haters that hate the Jonas brothers for stupid reasons, and don't give an explanation that makes sense, For example, some people hate them because thier from Disney and they haven't even heard thier songs they just suddenly hate them, In my opinion that's just stupid.     I respect that some people have thier own opinions and don't like certian types of music, I mean that's cool.   =)    But in my opinion Jonas ROCKS.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	Listen, if you like them, that is perfectly fine by me. I just can't stand how they brag about being such good boys. It annoys me. If they're the types of boys who don't like to be bad, okay, that's cool. Just stop bragging about it. It's so annoying. And, I hate turning on my t.v. and seeing them all the time. It gets so damn annoying. When they first came out,  I seriously did not care about them. But, now they are everywhere. It annoys me so much. I can't stand it.|`|V1hxvQukaa	i don't "hate" them, but i dislike them.    and they are a band, so shouldn't the reason i dislike be because their music isn't my style?     so yea... i don't like their music and i think they are just another generic, bubblegum pop boy band. nothing special about them...|`|ZtzKsVjdaa	...Why else would you hate them besides the fact that their music sucks?  If they're going to be musicians, the least they could do is sing well.  Hating them for their music is a very valid reason.      You know what I hate more than the Jonas brothers?  The idiot fans who think that I only hate them because i'm jealous.  Who could be jealous of some ugly gay boys who sing like they have pineapples up their butts?  Seriously, if you don't think haters have reason to not like the music, you should go get your ears checked or reexamine your life.  It only goes to show that you like what is popular and you don't care about music.  You only care about the label.|`|1LpDjvlIaa	Their voices aren't like normal singers we hear    and i think people hate them because everyone loves them so much and they r jealous XD|`|YJcd8OAeaa	1) they cant sing  2) they are gay  3) they look funny  4) they are in stupid movies  ...  should i keep going?|`|EcVVcgZNaa	I don't like them because they just act like they are so hot. Their music is alright though.|`|FYT97XLgaa	They're all prejudiced because Disney started them off. I like their music and I don't give a crap what others think. Hopefully you don't either.    BTW, their music sucks is not a reason. It does not suck, that's just your opinion.|`|AA11852352	i hate them cuz they weren't in twilight!!! lol other than that I love them.|`|K81RW9Rwaa	well i a mean i could go one forever.   their lyrical method is cookie cutter and has no real meaning  they suck at their instruments   they make my little cousins go mad when their music is on on disney  their Disney  they arnt that hot  the oldest is ugly   they have big thighs and wear skinny jeans  they call them selves rock (they wouldn't know rock if it hit them in the head)  they discourage people about religion (my cousin wants to convert to Christianity when her family is atheist)  i could go on but i have to stop unfortunately        hears some good music:   http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvdKPpVWz...|`|a76d7b38f83b2d1e38ebc4984a6e99aeaa	little girls love them. that's all|`|MzFqvXu7aa	'Because there gay'- Obviously there not.  'Because they can't sing'- Anyone can sing.  'Because there on Disney'- Disney is very popular.  'Because of there fans'- Lots of girls screaming there name.  'Because there ugly'- There the most gorgeous people i've ever seen!|`|dWemvNIhaa	I never said I hate the jonas brothers!|`|k39bNUgeaa	I hate them because they are disney and they suck  they can't sing  they can't play guitar    also i hate them because of you fans    THERE IS A SEARCH FOR A REASON  I see this question like 50 times a day
AA11852352	It's a very good movie. I loved it, but it's a tie between that and Twilight. I liked Twilight better sorta. You should probably see Twilight instead.|`|676fffa1d033bd7fc45c4eae89d1f268aa	well  worth seeing a great movie i give the movie 9/10|`|XF1ctbrkaa	I'd wait for the DVD .. or cheap theaters..  especially if you've watched the original..  It wasn't BAD.. just not great..  rent the original if you want it to be great.. (the original is a Korean film called a Tale of Two Sisters)..  I wasn't really disappointed in the film, but.. it could have been much better.|`|Plz4T3fzaa	You can always go to rottentomatoes.com and see if the % rating convinces you.

a1fq8ZHBaa	Rock Band For sure      My friend told me the GhWt instruments were shotty|`|87CAVhs2aa	I prefer GH.  The drums are a lot more fun to play, and I like the guitar better.  For me, it's easier to press the buttons on the GH guitar rather than the RB one.    Plus, Guitar Hero has "Band On the Run," which is a great song!|`|9w8EW24daa	guitar hero because i have it! lol!|`|YGvKisOoaa	i have rock band and its insanely fun. INSANELY :D|`|aeOujRkWaa	ROCK BAND is so much better. it is just a better quality. i have the game rock band and i've played guitar hero world tour not as good!|`|HCMrR1O9aa	ok, rock band is easier to play, but it has ALOT of older songs in it...(80's) and such....guitar hero is a bit more difficult, but it has a lot more songs to choose from and the graphics are better, so for a 7 yr old, i would consider the world tour because of the more up to date music and graphic quality rather than the diffuculty levels.....i hope i was of SOME help...lol|`|l4oH1W9oaa	Rock band is easier than guitar hero but guitar hero is better quality and has better stuff in it.    x|`|AXS4qkMgaa	I think Guitar Hero World Tour.  Because, it has better songs on it and it is easier to do.|`|9XRUBkWCaa	GH drums are more realistic :)|`|wzHY9IVPaa	Well, it depends on what gaming console he has. I have a Wii and an Xbox 360. They are both practically the same game. Guitar Hero has a better setlist of songs, though.|`|OO0wR688aa	rock band by far. they have many good songs and even a no fail mode if he cant do but wants to play with the family|`|CWUHwhOpaa	I have guitar hero world tour and i love it.the drums are a lot more realistic its almost like you actually have a drum set.the music is really great too. but rock band has a good setlist to.but it seems rock band is based more  heavy metal its just the style you seem to like better.Music is the most important difference between the two games in my opinion.they are both amazing games though. But if I had the choice I would choose guitar hero world tour

Dr2JjGIfaa	the intro sounds like it is sang by the hoosiers?     not too sure on what the song title is tho
XAv3og6raa	im not sure but if you want big long deep bass try 'bigger than hip-hop' by dead prez.|`|TJICaGQyaa	I'd say that.    Urban Shakedown - Some Justice  packs a bass punch.    You need good range sub woofer though otherwise most of it is too low and gets lost, 30% of bass sound is below normal hearing ability and is vibration alone (i.e you feel it rather than hear it).  This is how they made it, for that intention.    I know in a mates house where he built his own sub woofer system of pipes under floor, it felt like an earthquake was going on lol.|`|l4AW9OK4aa	i think it could be 'it doesnt matter' by the chemical brothers    heres the song but its not the video...the bass doesnt start til bout 1.30  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=scctUFAoS7...|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Anything by Motorhead|`|c8Nah2iCaa	anything by RHCP|`|c2e92ea2149d09e48eaba99f5f3a2f6daa	Nina - I Do|`|AHCtDhUcaa	death cab for cutie -i will posses your heart.|`|0fFg1gbEaa	Busta Rhymes - Dangerous|`|hYOEQdgnaa	ok u need a good stereo for this    02 - Go Insane (Psychic Girls' Groove)    http://www.traxsource.com/index.php?act=...|`|GcWuo9PWaa	Another One Bites the Dust by Queen|`|cad0f44f1e8e9e5376619cd1f7925a9daa	^_^ awesome dance tracks.

Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro' the perilous fight'  O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming.  And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air,  Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.  Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?     On the shore dimly seen, thro' the mists of the deep,  Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes,  What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,  As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?  Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam,  In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream;  'Tis the star-spangled banner: oh, long may it wave  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.    And where is that band who so vauntingly swore  That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion  A home and a country should leave us no more?  Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution.  No refuge could save the hireling and slave  From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,  And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.    Oh, thus be it ever when free men shall stand,  Between their loved homes and the war's desolation;  Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the heav'n-rescued land  Praise the Power that has made and preserved us as a nation.  Then conquer we must, when our cause is just,  And this be our motto: "In God is our trust";  And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave  O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Chorus:  Soldiers are we  whose lives are pledged to Ireland;  Some have come  from a land beyond the wave.  Sworn to be free,  No more our ancient sire land  Shall shelter the despot or the slave.  Tonight we man the gap of danger  In Erin's cause, come woe or weal  'Mid cannons' roar and rifles peal,  We'll chant a soldier's song.     In valley green, on towering crag,  Our fathers fought before us,  And conquered 'neath the same old flag  That's proudly floating o'er us.  We're children of a fighting race,  That never yet has known disgrace,  And as we march, the foe to face,  We'll chant a soldier's song.     Chorus     Sons of the Gael! Men of the Pale!  The long watched day is breaking;  The serried ranks of Inisfail  Shall set the Tyrant quaking.  Our camp fires now are burning low;  See in the east a silv'ry glow,  Out yonder waits the Saxon foe,  So chant a soldier's song.     Chorus      --------------------------------------...

I would stick to mainstream music of the genres that people at your party (and you) like. Just keep it a variety of styles and generally fast paced and it should be fine.  Stuff like Rihanna, Avril, Chris Brown, (well known) Green Day, Blink 182, Britney ect will be fine.   im not a huge rap fan, but i guess stuff like TI, Lil Wayne, Kanye West ect is good.  just choose what you liek and then shuffle the playlist to randomise the songs.  have fun at party|`|ph4Htg02aa	Mostly house, techno and trance.

AA10916001	You will hear a wide array of "talents"....some are pretty good, many are horrendous.      Either way, it doesn't matter....most of the people in those places are tanked.    Why don't you just go and listen for a bit and see how you feel about singing then? I'm surprised you would care what a bunch of drunks thought about your singing...I'm just sayin'.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Some are, most aren't, and nobody really listens anyway; they're  just there to sing for themselves and maybe their friends.|`|PtACBQNgaa	from experience, usually they are not so good..|`|XTDeAfTqaa	Some are, some are not.  In the last year two karaoke singers were filmed and put on YouTube. One got a job as the lead singer for BOSTON and another guy is now the lead singer for YES.  I've heard some people who are really good and are there to show off and some people who stink but are just there to have a good time.|`|cIwqtkKeaa	lol! Usually, theyre drunk so its a lot of fun to watch! But yea, most of them suck so youll look good!|`|49e1c1ffbe5862c9dafc300cae17824caa	I have been singing karaoke for 15 years and I get requests from the customers.  It tkes a lot of practice to be good.|`|o9XAcB4Taa	Normally they are rubbish, but they won't care what you sound like, just go and have a laugh.

0947e3ec7f569b16160b4d118918524baa	Theaters rent or license films they don't buy them.  If you are trying to get a film you have made shown in a local theater, the best way to go about it is to pick a small theater with multiple screens and ask if you can "rent" one of the screens to show your film for a week or whatever.  The way that works - you pay the theater but you keep the ticket money for that film.  They get the concessions. If you have a film which you think has a specialized audience and could do well with good word of mouth you can try suitcasing - which is making one print and renting it to theaters for limited runs. The last film I remember that did that somewhat successfully was Sankofa, a film about slavery. Their story is here:  http://spot.pcc.edu/~mdembrow/sankofa.ht...    Good luck!|`|AA10684960	great question,i see two problems,getting them to take you serious,and they may have a deal not to take private films,i'm not sure about the leagalities|`|feUMAvgLaa	Its possible, but illegal|`|Jevw5cbqaa	Nope, they only go for Hollywood movies.|`|9vcZ1shPaa	yeah i don't think so.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	No. What you would do, if you had one that was marketable, is to enter it into competitions in which it gets the favorable attention of movie distributors, who buy the right to make copies and get them into theatres.|`|7AW2Vugqaa	No, the movie theatres have contracts. To get your movie played in a theatre you would have to first take it to a film festival like Sundance and then if it won, you would be on the road to have your movie playing in a theatre.|`|GhdOUsdyaa	nope movie theatres have contracts with distributing companies I.E. paramount, sony, universal. like someone mentioned try entering it into a contest.    OR    you could write a screenplay in correct format and try to sell it and let the professionals deal with producing and distributing it for you.     good luck.

NC67WVlEaa	I'll chose Oasis but, I do love Blur, as well. : ) Song 2 is pretty cool.|`|	Oasis of course - where are Blur now??|`|	Blur are good but Oasis are Oasis. Doesn't get any better.|`|	Hmmm, that's a bit like having to choose between syphilis and herpes.|`|	Oasis, hands down.|`|	Easy...Oasis!|`|	Oasis in my opinion.|`|	Blur never made me want to slit my wrists.  I vote Blur, although it's fair to say, not counting the sideline of gorillaz, that Oasis is more successful.|`|	i don't really like either of them... both haven't got the best voices and there's no way in a million years i could listen to a whole album by either of them... but based on the meaning of the lyrics i'd say Oasis.   lol btw...this question reminds me of a Father Ted episode... XD|`|	Gotta go with the Blur. Oasis are a tad overrated. Still good, but overrated|`|	Blur is great and all...but they're definitely no Oasis!|`|	pulp.|`|	Oasis is far better bringing both faster rock songs and slower melodies such as don't look back in anger and wonderwall, where the blur gave us beetlebum...|`|	To my mind Blur were much more inventive and varied.    Much of Oasis's output is recycling the same stuff.    And longevity is no proof of superiority - otherwise the Rolling Stones would be much better than the Beatles.|`|	Blur! I absolutely love Blur. Damon Albarn is a musical genius :)   I like early Oasis stuff but everything over the last few years has all sounded too similar.|`|	Definetly Oasis, Blur was liked at the time but where are they now huh, their songs were stupid and repetitive meanwhile Oasis have good songs.|`|	Blur by a nautical mile. Oasis are a bunch of chancers who have tread the same line time and time again. It always amused me when people compared Oasis to The Beatles.Blur were much more like The Beatles than Oasis ever were/are. Take a look at both bands back catalogues and you'll know what i mean. Damon Albarn is this generations Paul McCartney. The guy doesn't get enough credit in my opinion.He's a smart cookie.  Oasis are just embarrassing. One decent album and then a whole raft of rubbish.Its sad the way they have turned out.|`|	I do like Oasis, and I do own a couple of their albums, but even after listening to a couple of their songs I feel like I had just played the same song three times, y'know?    As with Blur, they're very creative in all aspects. I think Damon's lyrics are much more observant and interesting than Noel's, but that's just my opinion. I think they're the better band, not necessarily the more successful.|`|	Oasissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss... =]

gJhwH335aa	I think all the credit must goes solely to the manga-ka, Nabuhiro Watsuki because he is the one that gives you the story and art of Rurouni Kenshin.    - Viz Media is only translated and published the manga volume (tankobon) in English.  - Shonen is just a demographic for the series.  - The manga runs and published on Weekly Shonen Jump Magazine back in the 90's  - The tankobon is published by Jump Comics in Japan  - The anime is made by Studio Gallop and Studio Deen.

0947e3ec7f569b16160b4d118918524baa	Universal Studios has a sneak preview club that you can sign up to get invited to sneak previews before the movie is released and they do screenings all over the country:    http://signup.universalstudios.com/sneak...    Certain theaters like the Laemmle also have sneak preview clubs. You don't say where you live, but usually the major studios hire a public relations firm in a city to run their sneak previews.  If you manage to go to one, ask if you can be put on their list and they will invite you to all their screenings.|`|4SwyBiMkaa	To get the tickets before it is released?                         OR  To watch the movie before it is released?    Option 1:  Only certain movies can have tickets sold before it's release date at the box office.  But (And I'm not positive) maybe Fandango has them before they come out.    Option 2:  You must be a movie critic, or you directed it. Maybe even a family member directed it, and they're nice enough to let you watch it.

A little girl would be lucky to have that especially after hannah montana|`|t0mb150gaa	My 8 year old daughter prefers Hannah Montana. And to all the people on here who are bashing her do we forget that she is just a teenager and they make mistakes. Hannah is a very moral person and did not get where she is because of her father (he was a one hit wonder), she got this far by working hard and her determination to make a difference in the world. I am very happy my daughter looks up to her if you actually listened to her songs they promote self esteem and making a difference in the world. As far as selena goes she is trying to follow in Hannahs footsteps and doesn't realize just what big shoes she has to fill.|`|CfUuDEW9aa	selena shes not a ****|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	I like Selena Gomez better because Hannah Montana is Miley Cyrus, and it kind of feels like the music is for littler kids.|`|2LbPca5Caa	'Hannah' is a slutt and Selena has a head the size of a walnut.   They both stink.|`|XP36zr63aa	selena; shes not as full of herself as miley is.|`|pmr65Sgraa	Selena because she is wholesome fun and ammusing not miley/hannah  baecause she was kinda stupid for taking those pictures in thebfirst place and guive kids the idea that posing like that is ok also she isn't very good at acting or singing|`|FkdEyXudaa	selena, Because miley is kinda acting weird lately, she sounds kinda country if you really listen, i have nothing againt country but she's singing pop with a country-ish voice. And selena is just a fresh new face, something new is always a good thing. And i love The hannah montana show, but Wizards of waverly place is the BOMB!!!!  lol|`|f4ehvRQlaa	selena!  =]|`|eykNXMzOaa	MILEY CYRUS!!!! i think she is so much better! selena gomez just wants every1 to think shes better than miley (in my opinion)|`|jkfXZXBfaa	selena.  not a hoe.  yet.|`|I3lOfq1xaa	Hannah Montana! because Selena Gomez is friends with Demi Levato who looks like she`s fourty(:|`|PgD03Jwcaa	selina is hotter|`|KyT9vN6maa	Hannah because its a palindrome|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	selena|`|RQc8fbjbaa	Hannah because that is my imaginary friends name.|`|194195b82dfda7927256d7ba5a877a46aa	selena... better role model and no scandals... how a true disney star should behave for young girls to look up to|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I don't care what anyone says. I like Hannah Montana the most, despite the fact that she took those pictures. Im not really into Selena that much, but i do think that her and Demi Lovato are very talented and will go far.|`|1cwoochZaa	Selena Gomez because there arent as much rumors going around about her.....|`|22HpFLCmaa	Neither. Hannha Montana, Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez, and Demi Lovato don't concern my life at all. They are all probably uglier than me and only look decent because of their make up. Not to mention they are all horrid actors and even worse singers. They aren't any of my bussiness and I don't think or care about them at all.|`|s6ekS4IQaa	Uhh...selena|`|qXg3idqXaa	selena  hannah just seems soo fake...|`|1LpDjvlIaa	Selena...shes a great actress at like acting like she doesnt care    and shes in my fav movie another Cinderella story    another Cinderella story=amazinggg|`|54a1161155ecf8d89d51a995fa7ef406aa	Selena.|`|rnaq8Yp9aa	selena because she appreciates her fans and miley is just full of her self. she's overrated. i DO think she can sing but i dont think she deserves everything she gets. selena on the other hand is pretty and nice|`|iKcqOdV2aa	hannah, selena is better at acting in her wizards show|`|3AffceXnaa	I would have to say Selena because she is a better actress and a better singer to me|`|cvWFTy3laa	selena,  i hate disney channel but i like her more than that rockstar poser!  hannah is a fake ugly chick who cannot rock/sing for crap!  she puts revealing pics of herself on cyberspace cause no one wants her,selena is cute,but hannah is pure FILTH!|`|EbtPz6jZaa	Hannah.  Because she has an actual show all about it... and Selena is just doing it because all of the actresses/actors on disney are like forced or something to do it... why do they all singg? xD|`|xOWmPLMraa	Selena, she is much more lovelier than Hannah, and at least she can act well.|`|ExlhUudEaa	Selena because hannah wears a wig and is actually miley cyrus who defintely cannot beat selena's cuteness.|`|GUq7IozLaa	Neither..|`|EcVVcgZNaa	selena, because she seems like she's like everyone eles, she doesn't act like she's better then other people.|`|jTRjaRmsaa	selena because she look decent hannah got caught up with the fame and now shes not a girl that kids look up to anymore..  so i would choose selena|`|AXS4qkMgaa	I would chose Selena Gomez.  Because she had to work her way into her career unlike Hannah who just auditioned and got the part in a big show because of her dad.  Plus, Hannah is a horrible actress and dancer and her voice is so fake.  Selena can dance, act and, though the record companies contort her voice a little, sing!  Also, Selena hasn't done anything scandalous and she is a normal girl!|`|b62uCHj2aa	Selena.. She's more down to Earth and not a big head...  +  she's a gr8 singer and actress too!

It's a great song, well its not really a song its just more of Eminem screaming and yelling but it is a great representation of Eminem's purest rage and his feelings towards his ex-wife. People always say that Eminem is always angry and this song really shows his true anger and hatred, uncensored. But be warned, it is an extremely violent song and it may not be the best for a school project. Then again, any song about killing someone woulnd't be too good for a school project. But it's really up to you.
fFu6WaYxaa	A lot of this depends on what your current musical skill level is.    you will want software and a decent computer if you plan to be computer based.    hardware based beat making is possible but not as flexible.    For a beginner, I would recommend that you try a software based setup like FL Studio. Since money is no object, it would be a small investment for you to see if it works for you.    Go to warbeats : http://www.warbeats.com and watch the tutorials. Whether you are sample based or pur compositional beat maker, they have video tutorials to help you learn and understand not only FL but the concepts behind the techniques that m,ay be applied to any software and hardware.|`|xiYibaEpaa	my best advice for you is to check this site out.  http://www.lboogzproductions.com/yourstu...
	Hmmm... I think part of it was in Ouran High School Host Club..|`|yacLHWqEaa	yes it sounds like its from ouran high school host club|`|JmtLuueHaa	I'm not too sure, but what anime do you have in mind? There's a very short part in this that sounds like it's from Ouran Host Club.    Edit: This in itself is not in the Ouran soundtrack, but as far as I can tell the songs are modeled after actual pieces to one extent or another.|`|5F4trnKqaa	If this WAS used in the score for an animation it was probably either Fantasia 1 or 2 from the Disney studios. Other than that it was used in the James Bond film "The Living Daylights."|`|suRgsVAqaa	I agree with demonfox, if it IS in an anime it is most likely to be Host Club.
d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	There is no brand name that's better for metal or any other type of music. It is the dimension, type of wood and thickness of shell that determines this. For metal you want at least a 6 ply shell and your toms should be deep. Many metal players prefer a square tom, meaning the depth is equal to the diameter (12x12, 13x13, etc.) I like a standard power tom that is 2 inches less in depth compared to diameter (12x10, 13x11, etc.) I also prefer maple shells. I use Pearl Masters Series.|`|KFjEkOlPaa	Joey Jordison's set is a poplar-shelled piece of garbage.     Mapex M Birch, and Pro M Maple are good. Mapex Orion and Saturn are wonderful.     Go all birch. Punchy, loud, projects well, great for recording too. Or a thicker shelled maple kit. (Keller-shelled 8 ply, Sonor 7 ply)    Tama Starclassic Birch-Bubinga is a great set too, like the Saturn from Mapex. Ddrum Dominion Maple, Dominion Ash also. Stay away from pre-2006 Ddrum, newer stuff is great.     Any Acrylic kit has enough balls too. Ddrum diode, Ludwig Vistalite, Phattie, etc.|`|sX0dKXzRaa	Another is Pearl (espescially Joey Jordinsons signiture kit)

If you have the money you can buy the following:    Randall KH-1: Based On Kirk's classic clean tone (like the first clean solo on "One" & "Master of Puppets"    Randall KH-2: Based on Kirk's Rhythm tone.    Randall KH-3: Based on Kirk's Hi-Gain Lead Guitar tones.  (like the 2nd solo on 'One' &  2nd "The Master of Puppets" solo    These will give you the exact tones from his entire career.

v0lB5VA6aa	Two rednecks, Jethro and Bubba, are sitting at their favorite bar, drinking beer. Jethro turns to Bubba and says, "You know, I'm tired of going through life without an education. Tomorrow I think I'll go to the Community College and sign up for some classes." Bubba thinks it's a good idea, and the two leave.    The next day, Jethro goes down to the college and meets Dean of Admissions, who signs him up for the four basic classes: Math, English, History, and Logic.     "Logic?"  Jim says. "What's that?"    The dean says, "I'll give you an example. Do you own a weed eater?"    "Yeah."    "Then logically speaking, because you own a weed eater, I think that you would have a yard."    "That's true, I do have a yard."    "I'm not done," the dean says. "Because you have a yard, I think logically that you would have a house."     "Yes, I do have a house."    "And because you have a house, I think that you might logically have a family."    "Yes, I have a family."    "I'm not done yet. Because you have a family, then logically you must have a wife. And because you have a wife, then logic tells me you must be a heterosexual."    "I am a heterosexual. That's amazing; you were able to find out all of that because I have a weed eater."    Excited to take the class now, Jethro shakes the Dean's hand and leaves to go meet Bubba at the bar. He tells Bubba about his classes, how he is signed up for Math, English, History, and Logic.    "Logic?" Dave says, "What's that?"    Jethro says, "I'll give you an example. Do you have a weed eater?"    "No."     "Then you're gay."|`|AA10684960	what do you call a 12year old hillbilly girl who can outrun her brother,,,,,,a virgin|`|wcIpYKWiaa	Q. How do you sink a Hillbillly fishing boat ?   A.

vuTthxHEaa	The term "Sell Out" is usually used with celebrities. It is MOST often used with famous musical performers.  Usually, a sell-out is someone who  1) Does something unique (such as a type of music they play)  2) Gets famous  3) Changes to make more money.    And artist usually "sells out" once they forget their fan bases, get signed to a major label, care more about money, etc.    Classic sell-outs: KISS. The band. They've got sleeping bags, coffee mugs, masks, and even condoms. The only reason they made music was for the money.     *Everyone has a different definition for who they think is a sell out.|`|pe69KF3Taa	going against or giving up your own morals/beliefs/integrity for money.|`|O02b6UI7aa	........|.....  ........|..........2 points ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  Here comes the truck delivering me 2 points!

It usually only happens when I finish writing a lengthy answer.|`|SB2gbgusaa	N/A      But when I did, it never happened.|`|B8IpOdwQaa	yeah that annoys me|`|0QN7xDNeaa	I've had an answering limit before, but I didn't know the actual number. It's not a ripoff really 'cause we're not paying for it.|`|PhiFWmLlaa	I never bothered counting.|`|5ktSlNodaa	Oh no, we're on their website, and we're not following their terms/conditions. AND THEY'RE TAKING ACTION. :(|`|avFMeZDqaa	....hmmmm....maybe depends on whos asking...-_-? hmmm well i'd say they are......(o_o)''' wait r u FBI?

XD XD|`|8815883e2ab4555a79f3a28621142ab1aa	did you hear he's moving into reese witherspoon's house? that b/tch, she made him sell his house!
vXOreO4Uaa	I think.  I haven't gone through that because i knew the name of the b*tch  i hated! God she was so annoying..Grr >=[|`|vGtM2F5Caa	yeah|`|0L0llku8aa	Yeah. There are plenty of kids in my school I hate just because of the way they act. I don't know any of their names, but I still hate them.|`|cfaEVLwvaa	I dont hate people.  I nothing them.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	Well, I mean, if there was someone who killed one of my close friends or family members and I didnt know their name, then yeah I could hate them.    But nothing like that's ever happened to me before, thankfully.|`|9UhoUcM2aa	yess i could...I dont like anyone until they give me a reason to like them.. thats just how I am.. haha|`|bwa9hhSpaa	Yeah like my nans friends. They just have to look at me and i get filled of hate XD|`|AWO6P93Haa	For sure.  When you see the way they act, talk, write.. they can make you hate them..|`|yorfmfiBaa	Nameless people are usually more hated...simply because no one can figure out who they are yet their still able to ruin lives ex: the zodiac killer|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Yeah. Like me, I don't know this girl, never actually met her, and I already hate her. It's just the way she acts, and talks when I'm around, like I'm trying to steal her friends or something. And sometimes I catch her staring at me as if I was I'm an enemy.|`|8ZxdLiaJaa	totaly!  his/her name isn't his/her personality!  and hate someone and i don't know her name ..|`|U2TUFJh4aa	you could, i mean i'm sure it's happened before|`|WGfWyHQYaa	yes, you can.  for instance, you may have heard of someone who did something you despise, but you don't know them, haven't seen them, and don't know their name. but because of what they did, you hate them and don't ever want to see him.|`|Rmtfm7qnaa	Sure! There are lots of users on Y!A  who don't like each other, even though they don't know anything more than the answers/questions that they give.    I dislike a few people here, but I wouldn't say I "hate" them... that's not me.|`|7afcTw5maa	duhhh|`|AosW4IvHaa	of course i could if they done something to me or my family .|`|MfyMZAgkaa	Yes! There's people I dont like because i see the way the act and see what kind of person they are.|`|DqzhHZnoaa	yea. if their fakes and liars, chances are you'd hate them whether they told you their name or not bcuz you wouldnt be able to trust them    but hate is a strong word ...|`|Zx8uw3I2aa	hate is a very strong word.. and i dont like to use it very often...  i would say i could very much dislike someone without knowing their name.. but it would have to be something very wrong for me to hate them    does that make sense? lol  same question to you..?|`|uwW92YNOaa	yeah - there's this chick at work - total *****... was complaining that there were fat people at her gym - then i found out her name, but i liked calling her scrag girl instead|`|vNk4XZCFaa	yes you really can...|`|p03Jc7eHaa	hate takes up too much needed energy|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Hmmm...If someone hurt or killed someone in my family or close friends, YES...    or if I saw a parent out in public hurting their child...YES...
jimNqqsyaa	because something is just that good.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	erm, I think it's kinda immature but hey|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Because very few words describe the sensation of the big "O"|`|gfwsKzNBaa	sexy?|`|yTCEJRC9aa	someone once convinced me to buy a brownie at a bake sale by saying 'these brownies are ORGASMIC'. i was so surprised i just had to try one.  they were orgasmic.|`|aqLDMy2Maa	to over explain something they really like.  just to over do it.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	idk?|`|vGtM2F5Caa	idk lol its funny|`|9ooXBxbJaa	sounds like a ******* good time|`|Z6ZM9p1waa	because its sooooooooo good|`|uaq8OSUjaa	It's an orgasmic word|`|vq4DYBGgaa	lol I only heard stewie say that|`|9hSSocD0aa	Because they like to say. so what.  -XD|`|YhjTbSmDaa	Well it derives from the word Orgasm, I guess.  And people like Orgasms...Haha.    I personally have no opinion on it.  I dont use it, I dont plan to use it.|`|wTqid2ONaa	I'm gonna start using that.    Man that cookie was ORGASMIC !!!|`|8yDvL9sJaa	ummm? more of an exaggerated heightened description of the word! making it 10 times better?|`|hccISKvHaa	Because they heard someone else say it and thought it was cool.|`|A1wN5SHZaa	its a great word, cant be used to often.. but it usually means something wonderful.|`|fgPEOWuxaa	the word orgasmic is orgasmic it makes me want to have sex just saying it, i have a friend who loves that word she says it all day, when ever she thinks somethins is coll she refers to as orgasmic.|`|AA10742567	I am guessing they must really like something to use that word.  I have never used it because it just doesn't sound right.|`|ba78727b3e73d53847b2a0cc9bf20853aa	Makes you think whatever they are discribing is better feeling then sex I suppose:(|`|sjQKEeOuaa	they are sick perverts|`|o7r9w4Wbaa	can you please stop wasting time on here and leave  room for people with real questions and and real people who want to help others!!    if you agree give me a thumbs up and maybe we can get the time wasters to realize serious people use this website for genuine help|`|aPaPlEiCaa	yeah i don't like it  i'v always thought it was a little dirty|`|snOPKSecaa	orgasmic is something that people like, so when people may say that about something else, like that perfume is orgasmic, it is because they enjoy it. =)|`|VJlUpfjBaa	It's just an exaggerated way of expressing extreme joy from something. Like it was so good it made them orgasm. Of course this isn't true, unless you're a guy getting a lap dance from a  stripper named trixie, and her cell phone rings after you've just about busted a nut in your pants, so she leaves and forgets to collect her money from you, and you get to leave the strip club with wet undies. That's orgasmic.|`|jIccV2sOaa	If you are an orgasm it would describe you. So may be they use it to liken something to an orgasm. What do you think????|`|b6fIIIhZaa	they use the term to signify the intensity of something its just another way of saying amazing or jaw dropping or ecstasy|`|0chCTew4aa	Im not shore... I hate when ppl say that about like movie stars and singers that they like... its like wow you dont even no this person and your already heading that way... lol|`|kANR98tIaa	Seriously i haven't heard of anyone that says that. If I did, I would have a quick comeback like, "you need a bigger penis", "your vagina is not fresh because of overdosing on acid" lol.|`|83e6c1939e2ebff0b836c19ae6bfd5f2aa	it reminds them of orgasm.|`|mJgtORKTaa	Becuz its an awesome word...and fun to say! I personally love the word...I think i should use it more often|`|oAOPphQWaa	I would never use that word for anything other then what it means|`|v5gpQqhDaa	dumb question|`|LNsxHiCaaa	IM AM HORNY :p|`|Oo1wKBI2aa	i think it can describde anything that is pleasing.. well, thats how i usually hear it being used. lol it sort of turned into slang.|`|L42by3rIaa	i think people are immature or having too much fun|`|VUlg3SCTaa	noun 1. the physical and emotional sensation experienced at the peak of sexual excitation, usually resulting from stimulation of the sexual organ and usually accompanied in the male by ejaculation.   2. an instance of experiencing this.   3. intense or unrestrained excitement.   4. an instance or occurrence of such excitement.   verb (used without object) 5. to have an orgasm.|`|TtWqeSF4aa	because it hurts sooo good XD|`|ZzfBi1szaa	Beacause that's is a very powerful feeling...not known by humanity :)|`|TU16BFJoaa	In order to describe a heightened sense of enjoyment similar to a moment of ecstasy.|`|7oKBEKAVaa	They use it because it's the best word to describe how pleasurable something was to them. I think it's a bit vulgar and shows a limited vocabulary, to be honest. To hear a dessert was "orgasmic" doesn't exactly sound appetizing to me, I guess I could be in the minority though.|`|8Pl2DdEzaa	people just love to make up some crazy words to please themselves when they're saying it to people, to be funny really.|`|ZDLVcDDqaa	To me it's somewhat immature, but I can see the attraction to it.     I mean, an orgasm is like, an epiphany of wonderful sensation and feeling.     So if you reeeeeally like something (I usually have heard it used to describe tasty things), then yeah - I guess it's like an orgasm to your senses and/or preferences or mood or what have you.     Makes sense, although some of the younger ones over-use it and just like to use it because it's referencing something sexual. I hear ya, if that's your complaint about it.|`|pjECqEVoaa	Some people will use it to describe how it makes them feel such as if your favorite food was cheese cake and it was so tasty the actual taste could be described as Orgasmic.
LiOOF1Plaa	Sure....if you want to wake up dead|`|OHKh0nMyaa	nope|`|7fXpLlhBaa	Yes. You could die especially if you are taking sleeping pills. Sleeping pills and alcohol should never be taken together. Don't do it.|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	Are you looking for permanent sleep?|`|bsvXwg0yaa	YES DON'T DO IT|`|iCKkOWI7aa	of course|`|eD9frdYmaa	uhh yeah! do you want to kill yourself ?!|`|tc2FjM68aa	yes unless you want to go to the tox unit at the hospital|`|4rcxkrF7aa	Tell ya what. If you drink Ever clear you don't need the sleeping pills.  If you are going to mix Ever clear with anything, Orange Juice is the ticket. Sleeping pills are never a good Idea as far as I am concerned you wake up late and draggy. And I personally get a hangover feel with sleeping pills.   Don't do the drink with sleeping pills!  One or the other, The terrible feeling in the morning from the Ever clear can only be helped with Ibuprofen. After drinking 1 to 2 big glasses of water. 4 Ibuprofen and good luck come morning!!    Boogie Boogie|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Yes.|`|AnIgXRcJaa	The rule of thumb is to never mix any thing with sleeping pills!

Ow3iwCJlaa	Hmmmm not that I can think of well not ones that would not be offensive but I will think on it - all though Yo mamma jokes are black jokes I think     and although this is not a joke the word Niga came about as a way for us coloreds to not get so hyped up when being called ****** So what we did as a culture and start saying it to each other so it didnt sting so bad when racists and bigots called us names  We got used to hearing it so much that we were able to control ourselves and not just fly off the handle  and now it has just morphed into what you see today  but that is not a joke just history hmmmm back to the drawing board    Oh wait I know one  A preacher was invited to preach at a church and when he got there He noticed all the congregation was white  so he said Hey this must be what heaven is like a choir singing a Black man preaching and all the white people listening. ://    here is one     Skinny White Guy / Big Black Guy   A skinny little white guy goes into an elevator, looks up and sees this BIG black guy standing next to him.    The big guy sees the little guy staring at him, looks down and says: "7 feet tall, 350 pounds, 20 inch penis, 3 pound left testicle, 3 pound right testicle, "Turner Brown."     The small man faints dead away and falls to the floor. The big guy kneels down and brings him to, shaking him. The big fellow says," What's wrong with you?"     In a weak voice the little guy says, "What EXACTLY did you say to me?"     The big dude says, "I saw the curious look and figured I'd just give you the answers to the questions everyone always asks me.     I'm 7 feet tall, I weigh 350 pounds, I have a 20 inch penis, my left testicle weighs 3 pounds, my right testicle weighs 3 pounds and my name is Turner Brown."    The small guy says, "Turner Brown? Thank God! I thought you said "Turn Around."    oh OR A CLASSIC     Now This Is Comedy  There were a total of 15 passengers boarding a small plane on their way to Florida. One black mother and her child were on their way to visit relatives while the other passengers consisted of the KKK on their way to a convention.     The plane took off and after flying for approximately 12 minutes an announcement came over the intercom from the pilot saying: "We have overloaded this flight. We are going to have to start throwing luggage out the window so the plane won't go down."     Two minutes later you could see luggage being thrown out the window. Five minutes after that, the pilot made a second announcement. "We are still experiencing problems. We're sorry, but the plane is still overloaded and we're going to have to get rid of some of the weight so the plane won't go down."     "We're going to have to ask some passengers to jump out of the window when we call you by your name. To make it fair, we'll go alphabetically. We'll start with A. Will all the African Americans please jump now?"     The black woman and her child continued to sit. The pilot came over the intercom system. "Next is B. Will all the Black people please jump now"?     The Black woman and child continued to sit. The pilot came over the intercom system again. "Next is C. Will all the colored people please jump now?     All the KKK was now staring at the mother and child. The black woman and child continued to sit. The child then looked up at her momma and said: "Momma aren't we all of those?"     The mother then replied to! her daughter, "Baby, we ****** tonight and the K's come before the N's."    THAT is a GREAT ONE|`|YUcRvlneaa	Thanks for the  |---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)

S1KQcCuFaa	Because they're forced upon us. You turn on the radio,there's celebs everywhere,turn on the tv all they do is pop up..  I hate them,except a few.  But mostly,I hate them.|`|Rmtfm7qnaa	Because they are rich and famous. Some people want to be like them and some people want to see them make really humiliating mistakes to show that even the rich and powerful are imperfect and make mistakes like everyone else.|`|Iov5Z7O4aa	WE, don't  The media does.  This is why they keep telling us every single stupid boring detail of these people's lives.   Sometimes, I think we would ALL be better off of the celebrities (or celebutards, in some cases) had their privacy, and we were spared knowing that Jackson Q. Sidefish just got a new toothbrush.    DISCLAIMER:  as far as I know, there is NO one called Jackson Q. Sidefish.  The name was invented by me.  If by some odd coincidence, this is your name, NO offense was meant.     OMG!  Did you hear????  Oprah just lost a WHOLE pound!  Stop. the. presses.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	I don't care about any of them, because they're not my family friends and i don't know them personally.

Celebrity gossip is everywhere ... we all like to know that even celebrities have crappy days and aren't always "happy". I don't think that anyone really cares in a personal level it just takes the focus away from our own problems for a few seconds. Some people are obsessed and yeah they do need help but for the most part celebrity gossip is inevitable.|`|qVqAPzKWaa	i dont really care 2 much about celebs catch up on them sometimes but really i dont care about them that much.|`|P2Txzhxnaa	Who said everyone does?

6eDn9SPpaa	I wish I could change my shyness...I really do try to come out of my shell, but it's sooo hard, like something is just holding me back. Sometimes when I really want to say something, I think about it for a while and try to push myself to say it, but when I feel it in my throat I just stop, hold it in. It's really hard to stop being shy, and I hate when people say to just not be shy!<br>  <br>  I admit I also care a great deal about what others think of me, and I tend to be a bit paranoid that they're thinking negative things about me, or talking about me, or laughing at me in their heads. Logically, I know they're not (most of them), but I think that's a big part of why I'm shy too....|`|iYEWbE23aa	To become less shy and actually present my personality..|`|GomB6c83aa	im not working on it i just wish i were extremely funny...but im not|`|Rb5rW8nvaa	my anger|`|lg6jexk7aa	I am currently working on my b*tchyness.

AA10021090	"Do you Know The Way to San Jose"was just one of numerous hits for Dionne Warwick. The song was written by Burt Bachrach,who along with Hal David,wrote many of her hit records.

AA10159262	There are so many...! The classic opening from his journal, "Dog carcass in ally this morning, tire tread on burst stomach. This city is afraid of me. I have seen its true face."    "This little stain, is that bean juice, or...?"  "That's right. Human bean juice. Ha ha. Badge belonged to the Comedian. Blood, too. He's dead."  "What, you mean THE Comedian...?"    "Man bursts into tears, says, 'But doctor, I am Pagliacci...!' Good joke. Everybody laugh. Roll on snare drum. Curtains."    A note left outside police headquarters with a dead multiple rapist: "Never!"    Note in Moloch's refrigerator: "Behind you."    "None of you understand. I'm not locked up in here with you. You're locked up in here with me." He's right. Absolutely right.    "Never disposed of sewage with toilet before. Obvious, really."    "Protect you? Because you were unaware whose execution you were arranging? Maybe person arranging yours doesn't know either. Nothing personal, hehn? Hope that thought comforts you whle waiting for axe to fall."    "Veidt. Cannot imagine more dangerous opponent."    I just LOVE the way he comes up behind some guys who are plotting trouble and says "Hurm." (as in "Ahem", muffled by his mask.)|`|	My favorite by far is "None of you understand.  I'm not trapped in here with you.  You're trapped in here with me."|`|	I like Rorschach too,but as for quotes,(this is just off the top of my head so the wording might be a little different)"i wasn't me yet, I wasn't Rorschach"and a few pages later"does that answer your question doctor?"|`|	Hello ,  "No. Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise."    =^,,^=

I have dealt with ferrel and stray cats lurking in my backyard. The number one thing, is to make sure there is no food or something that attracts a cat to stay in that particular area. Also, if you make a loud noise while the cat is there, for ex: banging pots or something, the cat will usually get frightened. If you continue doing this, chances are the cat will eventually get the message and sense it is not wanted here. Cats are very intune with other cats and even people's emotions! tell her not to feed it,,, and show the cat that u hate it!!! EVEN if u dont... throw a slipper at it gently, every time it comes.. yell at it...|`|vDXgWQMqaa	Good luck with that cats never forget.|`|grKtTRYtaa	Stop buying cat food.  Call the city.

eloWO2piaa	Because the greedy bun maker people want you to buy another pack of buns.. which would mean you would have to buy more hotdogs to match the buns..    and then you would have to buy more buns to match the hotdogs!    IT'S ONGOING! IT NEVER ENDS!    Like the guy above me said, they want you to buy hotdogs 80 pieces at a time. That's a lot of hotdogs..    Do you know how much sauce and mustard you would need!? You would then have to buy MORE sauce and mustard to match the amount of hotdogs!    MORE MONEY!    Why do they let such an atrocity go on!?|`|A1zfy4jEaa	i know, couldn't they add just two more buns or remove two hot dogs|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Just wait.

Everyone perceives the attic to be like, 'so creepy', because in the movies it's always like that.    But I think the basement would actually be a lot scarier, since it's cold and generally not as well-lit, and anyone could just be down there and you wouldn't even know it. In the attic, you would hear banging and/or creaking noises, or at least you'd know something is up. And the chances of someone breaking in through a basement are far greater than them breaking in through the attic XD    And plus, when a basement isn't finished, it doesn't look cozy at all..it makes it feel more ghastly o_o|`|3N2ElzcQaa	I'm really afraid of both, but I pick attic.|`|KyOP56Xsaa	definetely the attic, basement [my oppinion] is not scary at all cos its not very big and LOTS of lights, so thank god!    ~x~|`|p03Jc7eHaa	attic|`|xUKLUSL5aa	basement    cause someone can sneak in easier.|`|mggll8dRaa	I Luv My Attic and My Basement...lol...!!|`|xLO5VRYTaa	The basement- cuz thats where I live|`|4BppP7Mkaa	The attic|`|C2sZREuAaa	walking in seeing Herb & I making love|`|up363TZyaa	ATTiC.=)  i'm never going up there, but i'm in the basement right now.=)|`|LsLMGQhjaa	Attic.

f00af751af4d94ebe6844d97bceca46aaa	Nightwing is definitely the best out of all of them. Because he was Robin and learned evrything he could from Batman. He was/is a founding member of The Teen Titans now called The Titans. He has his own comic book series and he is every bit of the bad *** super genius detective hero that Batman is.|`|trztStObaa	I like Tim Drake    He figured out who batman was through detective work. He also makes a better robin than Jason or Dick because of his personality and the era he grew up.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Robin|`|AA10159262	I'm going to go out on a limb and vote for Jason Todd, the second robin. My reason is that in the now-classic stroy "For the Man who Has Everything" he single handedly saved Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman from Mongul by using the Black Mercy against Mongul. A lot of people have forgottent that story, and many do not consider it 'canon', especialy with the retcons that have taken place since Crisis on Inifinite Earths, but he did pull their bacon out of the fire that time. If you've never read the story, get it. I understand they also made an animated version of that story.|`|bjg8CqKYaa	Batgirl (Barbra Gordon)    I just like her attitude and personality, I have never like Robin or Nightwing, they just seem like Boring charicters who I couldn't get in to.|`|TDo1EMJkaa	I like all, but my favourite is Dick Grayson. Of course he used to be Robin, but in your context he's now Nightwing instead. I don't know why, but he's my favourite DC character!  While he's the same person as Nightwing and Robin, I've read a lot more of his Robin and I just really like his jokey ways and acrobatic style. =]|`|DHF0PWPqaa	The original, Robin.  Robin set a standard for all sidekicks I think.  Then he grew up to be a superhero himself. I think that's noteworthy. Also, Batgirl was basically his replacement anyway. Batman didn't need her she just wanted to do something exciting.

This rhyme refers to King Richard III of England. The Battle of Bosworth took place on 22nd August 1485. It was the fight for the throne between King Richard III and the head of the house of Lancaster, Henry Tudor. Richard sat on his horse atop Ambion Hill ready for battle, directing his armies when he was murdered. : "Humpty Dumpty referred to King Richard III, the hunchbacked monarch. At the Battle of Bosworth Field, he fell from his steed, a horse he had named 'Wall' (as dramatically rendered in Shakespeare's play Richard III: 'A horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!'). Richard was surrounded by enemy troops in the battle, and was butchered right there, his body being hacked to pieces. Hence the final part of the rhyme: 'All the King's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty together again.' " This mention of Richard III is not a new idea. And the dictionary defines "Humpty Dumpty" as being a person who is short, stout, and kind of dumpy looking. If Richard had a hunchback, then he may have been called this.  Other suggested origins are that During the English Civil War (1642-49) "Humpty Dumpty" was the name for a powerful cannon mounted atop the St. Mary's Wall Church in Colchester to defend the city against siege in the summer of 1648. (Although Colchester was a Parliamentarian stronghold, it was captured by the Royalists who held it for 11 weeks.) The enemy hit the church tower and the top was blown off. "Humpty Dumpty" fell off and tumbled to the ground. The King's men tried to mend him but could not. (The "men" were the infantry, and "horses" the cavalry.)Another suggests that "Humpty Dumpty" refers to the tale of Charles I (Humpty Dumpty) of England. He was toppled by the Puritan majority in Parliament (the great fall). The King's army (Cavaliers) could not restore his power. Charles I was executed by the Roundheads ("couldn't put back together again").Since the World Book Dictionary states that "Humpty Dumpty" refers to a short, stout person this idea is very plausible.Couldn't put Humpty together again. <br>  |`|hXdt1lntaa	nowhere lol<br>  <br>  humpty dumpty sat on a wall<br>  humpty dumpty had a great fall<br>  all the kings horses(?) and all the kings men<br>  couldn't put humty dumpty back together again|`|WGos7RSMaa	Silly, don't you look at the pictures?<br>  He was obviously an egg.....<br>  shaped dog.<br>  Don't be fooled.<br>  :)|`|enUZjr9kaa	humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty dumpty had a great fall.......

AA11485100	Its not just American media, the British media is just the same and its disgusting in my opinion. Theres so much crime and pain in the world that you would think the media would inform us about it as well as focus on highlighting the 'good' things about our society rather than what colour knickers Celeb Z had on yesterday, or who's cheating on who, or whether Britney's trying to kill her baby again this week.    In a way though it is our fault that it has gotten to this stage. If the public found this info of no interest the media wouldn't keep on throwing it in our faces. And the age of reality TV has escalated it beyond reason. I'd much rather judge celebrities on their supposed talent rather than who their dating or if their fashion sense is to my liking. At the end of the day their just people - with the same hang ups and dark secrets and off-key things about them like anyone else in our neighbourhood. Y should we think that there r no closet gay, diseased, paedophile or mentally ill celebrities? Do any of us personally kno their character or do we just kno what they what us to kno? It amazes me that people can be so easily brainwashed jus because someone can nicely sing a song that they can relate to, or seem to have a real funny personality in a movie.    Anyway, I've kinda gone off the point (sorry!) but yea the media do not report the things we actually NEED to kno, and glamourise people that we should NOT be looking up to.|`|d1353e889d9d73766f5470db6780fbe1aa	Absolutely. Why is it if someone researchs or scours for information about a "common person's" private life, they can be arrested for stalking, but with celebs, papparazzi follow them around and take pictures without permission without shame or punishment, and everyone accepts it and says how wonderful it is? I mean, seriously, who cares who bought what for Brangelina's kid? I don't care if Jennifer Garner was spotted with a new Versace bag. It's a waste of time.|`|AA11212288	You are totally right.|`|AA10553382	Yes, the American media is too precoccupied with the private lives of its celebrities, and distracts from giving us the honest news of our president business in favoring the oil companies and big business and the leaving the little guy to sufer on his/her own without any governmental funded support services like the Social Security system and the welfare programs.|`|76b81fb9ff6abb0a3a77fd71d31451b9aa	they have nothing better to do|`|8db732b7365982a365b322fc79faec32aa	yes the media is too preoccupied......A celebrity is not going to pay our bills and go to work and take care of our children.....I rather hear about our country;s economy and local news than if brangelina had a baby in Africa

hl1ewPh1aa	One day, Aladin's Girl was treking through the jungle along with Joshua the Juggling Jellyfish. They loved to have adventures together. Suddenly they found themselves on a ghost pirate ship. 'How did we get here?' asked Aladin's Girl. They wished they were still at home. 'How on earth did that happen?' said her companion, and walked into a invisible ghost wall. 'Ouch!'. Suddenly a huge ghost Dragon appeared. They felt a sense of foreboding, and then to their dismay the lights went out. 'That was a close one' said Aladin's Girl , the laughter clear in her voice. 'I've got an idea' said Joshua the Juggling Jellyfish. 'Let's swing through the trees`like Tarzan and make good our escape.' They got home safely and to this day they believe in ghosts|`|A1zfy4jEaa	three people say that they saw two different ghost/figure in my house, i for one have never seen it. and don't want to see it....*knocks on wood*|`|8nvesSFFaa	No but I caught an orb in a picture!!!  My family and I went to a haunted town three years ago for a haunted tour. We even went into a cemetery at 10 at night!!! Well anyway on the way home we decided to stop at the haunted movie theatre they took us to to take pictures. This movie theatre is haunted by its first owner he was Greek. So one of the pictures ended up with an orb in the picture! My family and I believe it was the Greek owner coming by to say hi to some fellow Greeks!!! lol. :)|`|hhQuG9vQaa	Yeah I've seen a ghost. The ghost is my dad he visits me all the time he has since he died 8 years ago.|`|GWcVsDCDaa	Yes  I have only seen shadows and heard voices.      1.) When I was little, we used to see shadows of them but they weren't scary.    2.) The first house me,hubby and son ever rented, we would always hear voices and see shadows.  I would hear someone weeping at night and someone would play with my kids toys too.I really had bad creepy vibes about that place.  After a month, the next door neighbor shyly aproached us.  He told us that it has been years that the house was empty.  He told us that a couple lived there with their son. The husband was always arguing and was very jealous. He killed his wife, child and himself.  We moved out and I have not seen anything  freaky since that time.|`|0w9tY32uaa	yes, i have.  it was my great grandma in my living room.|`|wZloBlGlaa	yeah. i was in my basement with a friend all alone and we both felt wind and then we got really cold and got goosebumps at the same time then we saw a flash of something in the same spot, same time. it was really scary!|`|p03Jc7eHaa	my mom said she saw one in her grandmothers old house in the 50's|`|INf502UUaa	No, but I'm a believer too. :)|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	I didn't see her, but things appeared to be moving and noises were coming from certain objects.|`|6ik7OJRNaa	Last month I had the flu for 10 days......

I saw a ghost.......|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I've seen some things that I guess people would considered to be a ghost. Heck if I know what they were but it freaked me out each time. I can't type out the whole story of each of them now but I'm obviously a strong believer as well. And I'm not a crazy person or anything.     The first two times happened in my mom's store and the third time happened outside at night at a camp retreat. The third time was weird because I saw someone walking who was wearing a white t-shirt and asked my friend if she saw him as well b/c she was right there and she said no. Then, later, she kept looking over into the woods and I was looking in the same direction. After we went back inside she told me she saw someone in a white t-shirt but I hadn't that time.     Nobody else was outside and nobody had a white t-shirt on anyway. Weird...|`|WggRi7MZaa	Thankfully, I have not.|`|qsuYKa3naa	I have, twice but it is still too painful to talk about it|`|nGxrvQavaa	No.      Ghosts do not exist, therefore it's impossible to see one.

DjCLWseZaa	IDK, it really depends on how old you are and who you want to prank. The funniest prank pulled on me so far  was my mom called a family meeting and sat us all around the table. Then she said that she was pregnant and pulled out a positive pregnancy test. Everyone totally believed her. It was april 2, so we were less suspicious than we would have been before. My brother suspected her, asking why she hadn't used one of the new digital tests. She said that it was cheaper and went on to show us all our own tests which had our names written on them.

This is the first time that there is actually a set of twins. The other two seasons had a girl named Tila Tequila. This season confused me a little bit at first too because I didn't know they were both looking for love. I thought one sister was looking and the other sister was going to be there to help her pick the right person.

d25023afd392fb81bfa46cea9f957f1caa	Diehard Gary Oldman fan! He has done SO MANY good roles, from Sid in "Sid and Nancy" to Mason Verger in "Hannibal" (And even underneath all of that makeup, he STILL stole the film!). However, I must admit that his role as Jack Grimaldi in "Romeo is Bleeding" is my favorite. As the dirty cop that gets in over his head when he meets Mona Demarkov (Sexy Lena Olin), the woman he's supposed to bump off for the mob, you can't help but feel a tiny bit of sympathy for him.|`|AA11695611	Loved him in Sid & Nancy and Dracula.|`|AA12326124	He was great in Dracula, and Fifth Element as well. He's creepy..... but very effective being creepy.|`|fb424e91aac5d09bad0919b92c8f05aaaa	The Scarlet Letter|`|dfc3abc718e7345bb76a6ee45b9b5ba8aa	There was a Mike Leigh film called Meantime, one of Gary Oldman's first roles, and he was very good in that. It is a curious, low-key, very downbeat film - he plays an unemployed skinhead, there is a very strange scene where he is inside a piece of pipe and he is thrashing around, it's very peculiar.    My favourite Gary Oldman film though is probably Prick Up Your Ears, in which he plays the playwright Joe Orton, one of my heroes, and he makes an excellent Orton. Totally recommended. In fact, I think I'll go to my local video store and see if they have a copy...|`|66b6ef808239da999e0dfcb3682818d1aa	I loved him in Immortal Beloved.

85ff93cdce4ad537cb0162ff95f814b8aa	yeahh ive heard it and seen the music video. i like the song and yeahh i think it was one of her better songs too. id have to disagree on not likeing the music video. i like it a lot i also thought she looked a lot like her sister at parts.|`|AA12304310	I love her voice, but I never thought much of her songs. The lyrics or the band, I just couldn't get into her. This song, I really enjoy. I watched it on television and really fell into the meaning of the song. If she could make more songs where I feel like I'm the song, that would help. I like this song the best. I have to disagree with the video part. She always makes good videos, but I really like the story in this one.|`|8daf591c5023647b4367b40403a6d6eeaa	no have u?|`|89b714ea0f0e89263f618c945d16d074aa	No.  She's "Invisible" to me...

2fd94398fe80b493c084568f387a9cc5aa	Hell yes. Seether is one of the greatest bands of all time in my opinion. Not only are they talented, they are amazing as people as well. ON a serious note though, I have not one complaint about any of their CDs. Every track was to my satifaction. SEETHER ******* ROCKS!!!!|`|0b61a76416b5e2e5c4757dc95cb70eebaa	i love seether!|`|AA12399333	of course.  I went to their concert at Myth.  They were touring with halestorm, flyleaf, and shinedown.  remedy is a good song,  so is broken and i so ashamed.  i think that's what the songs name is.  i think he sounds a lot like kurt donald cobain from nirvana.  when i first heard one of his songs, i thought that it was one of nirvana's un published songs.|`|d596f091cde54e2abba48ca6275a5d4faa	yeah wichone speicficly? seether kicks ***!!!|`|89eb950b6ca5236f4e9c140c5c976599aa	I DO!!!!!!!!

Remedy got alot of play.  I like them alot.  I think they are alot like nirvana.  I really like his voice and how it sounds behind his Words.  i saw him live tried ot talk to him outside the show but he was too stoned just laughed and walked away.    My favorite are    Gasoline  truth  the gift  lover her  you know your right cover  69 tea  out of my way off the freddy vs jason sound track is tight.      of course i love remedy as well.
f8745dc9fda9697fda3ef5eb79c9cb84aa	It is tempting ,in deed.I am keen on every Bond movie.But I would not call my self a "James Bond Fan".|`|AA11491405	But how did Ernst Blofeld fit into all this?|`|392e626e1abd325d66872b9f8b56e91faa	James Bond... A great character created by Ian Fleming. Best one to play the part was Sean Connery. Last nights program showing his achievements was exceptional. He surely deserved the life time award.   As far as Specter, he is real and is part of the U.S. Senate. He is a villain.
AA11285410	007 all the way.  Ethan Hunt would murder 007 in hand-to-hand or a shoot-out, but 007 wouldn't give him that chance.  Bond will have planned the entire event well ahead of time, and execute it with simple cunning and efficiency.  All the special effects and extreme sports in the world won't help Hunt escape from pure efficiency.|`|AA11200298	James Bond. Because Ethan Hunt is played by a lunatic and he doesn't have fancy schmancy cars and godforged gadgets. 007 will PWN Ethan's *bleep*.|`|c8d79dd3d171a0612ca304c34c98fb79aa	007...but perfect dakr is the best spy game...just so you know|`|727d1160c859dc67c4a9ae41a0311844aa	007 aka james bond .

Bond is good but relies on gadgets!|`|2e4ed15de9a1b8a51806a0064ba10be4aa	Ethan Hunt cuz he focuses more on the job then getting in a girls pants(unless one comes along that is).  He's less egocentric than Bond but I like Sean Conrey as 007.|`|AA11911134	007|`|AA12269421	bond definately

AA11784502	Hello ,  It was a marketing gimmick ;  "Much debate has surrounded Bazooka Joe's widely-recognizable eye patch. But despite popular belief, Joe is not visually impaired, nor is he the lovechild of Blondie and Captain Hook. According to company lore, Bazooka Joe began sporting the classic eye patch to make himself look interesting and "distinctive," much like the models in the popular 1950's Hathaway Shirt advertisements Joe's eye patch intentionally satirized. Since then, Bazooka Joe has experienced countless comic adventures, from intergalactic space travel to visits from Shakespeare and Picasso. Bazooka Joe's popularity has inspired a band, a DJ, and even a cocktail all bearing the name Bazooka Joe. "    =^,,^=
AA11784502	[He got into a fist fight with Bazooka Joe!]  Hello ,  EC Segar is said to have modeled Popeye originally after an old sailor that lived in the town Segar grew up in. The old man's name was Rocky Feigle. Rocky had no teeth which caused his jaw to jut forward, he was missing an eye, but did not wear an eye patch he just kept his missing eye tightly shut and the other one popped open (Pop - Eye). The old man's fore arms were well developed and muscular from a life of pulling on ropes. Rocky was suppose to be as tough as nails, and was rumored to never have lost a fight.       =^,,^=|`|AA10159262	It's never been shown, but Popeye supposedly lost it in the "mos' arful battle of me whole life",    according to the "Encyclopedia of Super Heroes, put out by Facts on File Publications (1985), edited by Jeff Rovin

I will give you a suggestion... he maybe affected by the credit crunch.. lsot his job etc... the reason is men tend to get depressed when one of three things go missing in the life... direction, social prowress, and sexual prowess..... the credit crunch may have seen him loose his job, social standing, money, and his ability to be useful to his partner... he has lost function in life.....hence why men die on average in the west at 65 when their job comes to an end... and hence why vicars live for such a long time... most jobs end.... except for that socail job.. so they loose the will to survive and get depressed. Call him if you are that worried.... give him a chore to do... it will give you time to talk and he may release information... as he will feel he has done you a favour and therefore will be allowed a favour in return... that favour being you lending your ear|`|lBRud4y5aa	Forget psychics they are all con merchants.

AA11022138	Why do you want to them? Are you willing to become a superman???     Anyways some of his powers are as follows:  1) He has a body of steal, i.e. a very tough body.    2) He has X-Ray vision.    3)He has the ability to fly high in the sky.    4)He is capable of going in space and then protecting our Earth from any Aliens or Meteors or Meteorites.    5) He also has the ability of Telepathy.   P.S.: If you don't know the meaning then reffer to the Dictionary    6) He can lift very heavy objects easily.    7) A bullet cannot even penetrate his eyes. It breaks off as soon as it hits his eyes.    8)Do you want more of 'em??    9) He can fire laser from his eyes and tear off the gates of the most strongest SAFES.

Although contemporary media still reference Superman that way, the character's powers are much more vast and complex. For most of his existence, Superman's famous arsenal of powers include flight, super strength, invulnerability, super speed, vision powers (including x-ray, heat, telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super photographic memory, super hearing, and super breath, which enables him to freeze objects by blowing on them.|`|AA11200298	X-ray vision, laser eyes (like cyclops' but thinner), super strength, invulnerability to ANYTHING (bullets, bazookas, missiles, huge chunk of metals, name it), can breathe in outer space, can breathe underwater, flying abilities, faster than a speeding bullet, a very tough skin, increased agility.

AA11457409	Yes M has the 3 gallon jug , and Z the 5 gallon jug:    M fills his jug up and pours it into Zs, so Z has 3 in his jug.  M fills his jug up again, and then fills Zs jug up, but this leaves 1 gallon in Ms jug since it only takes 2 more to fill up Zs jug. Now Z dumps his jug, and M puts the gallon he has into Zs jug, so Z has a gallon in his jug. Then M fills his jug up again and pours it into Zs, so Z now has 1+3 =4 gallons in his jug.   Now they celebrate: M gets a gallon of pure alcohol and pours it into Zs jug so they have 5 gallons of hooch, and then they make some calls and have a party. End of story|`|AA11282250	Fill the 5 gallon jug, then use the water from the 5 gallon jug to fill the 3 gallon jug.  Now there are 2 gallons of water in the 5 gallon jug.  Empty the 3 gallon jug, then transfer the 2 gallons into the 3 gallon jug.    Now you have an empty 5 gallon jug and a 3 gallon jug with 2 gallons of water in it.  Fill the 5 gallon jug, then move 1 gallon from the 5 gallon jug to the 3 gallon jug, leaving exactly 4 gallons of water in the 5 gallon jug.|`|AA11930204	You fill up the 5 gallon jug.  You use that water to fill up the 3 gallon jug, leaving 2 gallons in the 5 gallon jug.  You empty the 3 gallon jug, and pour the remaining 2 gallons from the 5 gallon jug into the 3 gallon jug.  You fill up the 5 gallon jug again, and pour 1 gallon off into the 3 gallon jug, on top of the 2 gallons already in there, leaving 4 gallons in the 5 gallon jug.    EDIT: In response to your additional details...of course you "finally" figured it out!  I posted the answer for you!

(|`|GC2ruUZdaa	"Crocodile Hunter" was an interesting series and it inadvertently taught a great lesson about the dangers of underestimating the ability some species have to kill, but I don't believe there was ever a Crocodile Hunter cartoon or comic book, so I don't see how your rather general question applies to the Comics and Animation section. Perhaps it would be a good idea if there was a Crocodile Hunter comic book or even a cartoon, as either could be used as a vehicle to do what the series was centered on: teaching facts about animals. I would rather see a  comic book version of Crocodile Hunter, since I don't think young children would grasp the idea that a cartoon was trying to teach realistic lessons about exotic animals.
c6ceb05e8348f7b5fd18a8ef10c4c046aa	I'd say "Because I'm an American and that guarantees me  freedom of speech". If you truly are sick of the economy, the price of gas, corruption or just plain stupidity of our elected represenetative (and a lot of people are) - do something to change it! Make sure you vote in every election - because you care and one person can make a difference. Make sure that write or call your representatives when you care passionately about  issues. They may not agree with you, but they work for you, and they had better listen. Find a blog or two that fits with your ideals - you'd be surprised how many people out there agree with your views,  no matter what they are.

AA10577708	It's great. I've seen the movie. Read my review.    Superman--born on a planet which has long since died--has been raised by adoptive parents on the Kent farm in Kansas. The young boy Kal-El is renamed Clark Kent, and though he has grown up among humans, he is not one of them. Under Earth's yellow sun, he can do two things humans can only dream of, but to co-exist with them he must live a dual life as mild, unassuming Clark Kent, secretly transforming into the Man of Steel when the world cries out for him. But now, the world's crises have gone unheeded for five long years since Superman's mysterious disappearance. Without him, crime has risen in the city of Metropolis and beyond; that's not even counting the future destructive acts of Lex Luthor, who has been sprung from prison with the specific intent of using Superman's technological secrets for his own personal gain and glory. Lois Lane, star reporter for the Daily Planet and the love of Superman's life, has moved on since Superman left without a word. She has even won a Pulitzer Prize for her essay, "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman." Lois has other issues to contend with--she is now engaged to the editor's nephew and has a young son to look after. But for Superman, the long search for his place in the universe ends back at the Kent farm, among the only family he has ever known. His destiny lies in Metropolis, where one look in Lois's eyes tell him that this place, among the flawed but ultimately good people of Earth, is his true home. And with Lex's plan coming to fruition mere hours after his return, the world will never need Superman more than it does now.|`|AA10689311	never saw it but maybe i should see it and...your e-mail thinger isn't working  lol  check ya later ?|`|ae49598a790ca134bb698ff1c3cefa55aa	I think that superman is really returning.|`|5b242a6d4959b0df0001d41b728d43f7aa	it seems good but i am waiting for Spiderman 3|`|AA11200298	Tu tumvz ap.

Here is the plot as they list it.    "A man in his early 30s (keane) struggles with the supposed loss of his daughter from port authority bus terminal in new york, while fighting serious battles with schizophrenia. we can never be sure if the loss is real or imaginary; or whether his overt interest in helping young girls is innocent and of a fatherly nature, or is of a darker, scarier motive. the film is about a search for family, belonging, and the overwhelming need for human connection. it is a disturbing and thought provoking story about real characters dealing with every day life. keanes quest for his daughter and kiras (kira is a young girl he befriends)longing for a nuclear family is what connects them and the audience to a heartbreaking story."

waDKbT61aa	I started on the Behringer pack. The guitar was awful but the amp was pretty good to say it's only a 60 starter set. I then moved up and got a 220 Les Paul copy. I know have a couple of Jackson Guitars - DK2M Pro and JS30RR.    Your not going to get much with 120 in terms of profesional quality but you could certianly get something better than you have now.    You could move upto a Squire Strat. Squire are owned by Fender and make cheaper copies of Fender guitars.    http://www.dolphinmusic.co.uk/shop/flypa...

u5ceqsfHaa	i use to work for a publishing company, that published some animes =) they say that there's a wait of two years before an American comapy can license an anime, they do this so that the japanese company gets the most money out of it, once the anime has become less popular in japan then American companys can license the anime. i think waiting is worth it =) its just two years right? one year has already gone by so VK should be to America in 2010 =) hope it could come out sooner though XD|`|yacLHWqEaa	ok I hate english dub it sucks real bad cuz the ppl doing the characters voice cant even do te characters voice right ever or say the japanese names right besides there not making an english dub so u better watch it in sub|`|QCPddhlUaa	Hi Candice714,    It depends on how far along you've gotten with the series. If you haven't started it yet, then maybe it'll be worth the wait to see Vampire Knight in English dubs. However, if you've already started it, you should just continue the series with English subtitles. It's amazing to what extent the story has gotten to, and season 2 has even concluded. Hopefully, there will be a season 3. If you keep waiting for the English dubs, you will end up missing the magic of Vampire Knight and all of its characters. Instead of missing out on such a great anime, just watch it with the subtitles.|`|RN7dIJHFaa	well i would personally stick with the orginal. with the subs i mean.  i love dub but i say it would be great to stick with the orginal.

0FUSQ8JGaa	Ahah, io invece amo dire SPENGI invece di SPEGNI...<br>  e poi "eco" può essere anche maschile ;P alla faccia di chi dice che è femminile!<br>  <br>  Comunque se parli dell'improvvisazione di Franischiello Schubert che si sedeva e faceva le fughe al volo... beh quella MORVE perchè... chi cavolo ci riesce??? O_O<br>  <br>  Ma sinceramente non so perchè dici questo... molti chitarristi in concerto (Eliot Fisk, mi pare anche Williams, Dyens, ecc.) improvvisano a valanga...<br>  Il mitico Segovia improvvisava perchè superata una certa età si dimenticava i brani e li improvvisava... XD<br>  Ma credo che ciò valga anche per gli altri strumenti, per rispetto lascio che siano gli altri a fare esempi.<br>  Poi personalmente anch'io, ma come penso tutti, improvviso parecchio.. passo ore al piano a "cazzeggiare" soprattutto quando son stanco e mi svago... <br>  <br>  Forse ti riferisci solo al fatto che in un concerto jazz, ad esempio, è scontato che gli esecutori improvvisino, mentre nella classica lo fanno in pochi e solo se vogliono...<br>  Inoltre molte partiture ottocentesche avevano parti "lasciate al gusto dell'esecutore" soprattutto le cadenze... invece oggi queste parti son già scritte dalla casa editrice, o comunque vengono preparate "da casa"... l'esecutore non le improvvisa più...<br>  Si in effetti i tempi di Paganini son finiti... eppure anche all'epoca esistevano i contratti teatrali... lo stress ce l'avevano anche loro...<br>  Bah... eppure oggi esistono concertisti molto bravi, son del parere che il campo dell'esecuzione ha fatto passi avanti...<br>  <br>  Mmm diciamo così... l'improvvisazione c'è ancora, è diminuita rispetto ai tempi fantastici ottocenteschi, però il "luogo comune" è solo un luogo comune... non MORVE... ma VIRVE ancora!!! ahahhah!<br>  <br>  Bye :)<br>  <br>  IN RISPOSTA AD AMATAIMM...<br>  ma che c***o fa sto tipo col violino?????<br>  Hai visto come ridevano quelli in orchestra?<br>  E la gente che bisbigliava?<br>  Beh... non so... sono scosso al momento per rispondere... mi chiudo nelle mie stanze...

For instance Angela Gossow from Arch Enemy. BEST girl screamer there is. But if your looking for something like flyleaf, Learn how to sigh deeply. And the grunting sound you get from that, Thats where the screaming should come from.   But try to be unique and not sound so much mainstream.  I sound mainstream...

nMYxyrzraa	For vocals, Marley, no contest, not even close for vocals.  But for tracks, sound and music only the Clapton's production was better.

GBKaftrJaa	Sorry, I can't travel through time and watch it and tell you.  Physicists haven't figured out how to travel around in time yet.  If they had Widmore wouldn't have funded Daniel's research on it for 10 years.    And the writers of the show have always been very secretive about what will happen.  Is the show supposed to end?  It seems pretty popular.|`|H7Q5IBI0aa	I wish I had time jumping power- I could give you your answer. The only people that could come on this website and give you a definitive are the writers and Matthew Fox. The writers actually let him and him alone in on the secret.     But what I THINK will happen, since you asked ;) is that it's going to end the same way it began, a la Dark Tower, in an endless time loop.

EWNQxNbjaa	I agree with you.  Emotion won over talent.|`|PKe37L24aa	Neither of them were that good.

Dan got through because of the sympathy. He is not commercial and doesn't have the X factor - With all due respect to what happend to his wife, if he never had that story to tell, would they let him through? Don't think so...<br>  <br>  Scott quit his job as a bluecoat just to try and win the X Factor, and never gave any sob stories/tales. He was quiet and a good lad.|`|N2JkgQ4Uaa	I agree... I don't actually like Daniel's voice THAT much... I just don't =/<br>  <br>  then again I think x-factor is dissapointing this year save for two singers ;) |`|QdUShfGgaa	ggg

Listen to "Let Go" or "Tracking Treasure Down." Although it's important to note that Tiesto is Trance, Coldplay is Alternative Rock and Imogen Heap is more Downtempo, so you're asking for different things. I admit I'm not too familiar with Imogen Heap though...|`|Z1cHIyMraa	hellogoodbye, the prize fighter inferno
AA11324309	i love garth and i wont justify your question with anymore of an answer than that|`|AA10935094	Garth NEVER cheated on Sandy with Trisha. Garth and Sandy had a lot of problem the general public didnt know about.|`|d7784b8456621cae871bd00e20b53e2faa	First of all, I never liked him. Probably because he sings country music.|`|2f2d0585d2f3afc2c4a0776afc1388d2aa	Hes done.  I hated him ever since he made his own playground.  I used ot love his music, but thats where it ends.  Marketing works it also makes people hate youa nd you can really ruin your image.|`|9fe61a5c2ad263e8bd3bde5c1aa9ad84aa	nope still a huge garth fan and will be there when he wants to tour again in 10 years..   **** happens..people can't help how they feel or who they fall in love with or when they fall out of love.. their realtionships are too public. it happens so often in the real world..and people move on.. maybe we should try it with famous people. as life goes on people change. sometimes it works out so they can change and grow together..someimtes they go different ways..him and sandy are just honky dory. he didn't cheat on her.. they split ways and he was very friendly with trisha. sandy gave him the blessing to be with trisha..so what's it matter to you??? he is still a wonderful family man.. his kids come first, and him and sandy are still very close. it's a family of 5 in that situation..and once again..still not sure what busines it all is to you..but hey, who am i??|`|8d3b06c786778f215441d92a56160ae5aa	People change over time and so do their feelings. No one plans on getting divorced when they marry, that's why they say the vows and commit to eachother in the first place. While this may be an unfortunate situation, you can still think he's a wonderful singer; if not a person. I don't see why you can't separate his personal and professional lives. Besides, a breakup always leads to good songs.|`|7be5ed010d71aea780026e771411b36aaa	Yep, his whole public persona was a total scam.  He's such a lying jerk.  Those are some family values i wouldn't want to teach MY kids.  He shouldn't have pretended to be this big family man who loved his wife so much if he was just going to run off and leave her for another woman.|`|11f18c062bf14f3c02d05a9be5db0d9daa	YESSSS! He is such a faker! I had a feeling him and old Tricia was gettin it on for quite awhile but he always thanked his "lovely wife Sandy" for her support all those years and then he dumps her the first chance he gets. I hope Sandy never has to work another day in her life and that Tricia has to het a job cleaning her house! And this retirement crap is just another way to cash in and make some more money!|`|36f184828ea58b6b2597bc2a21f8f1b8aa	No|`|5d751d1716646c8bb0da218d401c076caa	I still love Garth and always will, though I can't say that I wasn't disappointed when I heard that Garth and Sandy were splitting up.  But things are hard when you are apart as much as they were.

I didnt see the village.|`|328d75fad4d3c73c6443abd958fc059baa	I won't even bother seeing it - "The Village" was a waste of time and so was "Signs".  And didn't he also do "The Sixth Sense"?  I was not at all impressed with that either!|`|AA11664928	I like his movies. they are no crude or vulgar.  he uses film technique to create suspense.

EfAV3x9Yaa	It was awful.<br>  Called the happening and nothing happened.<br>  Boring as hell.<br>  <br>  And for people that say "we should be looking at this as a wake up call to enviromental issues," there are plenty of good movies about how we're going to be affected by what we're doing to the planet. Just off the top of my head is "The Day After Tommorrow".<br>  <br>  The Happening was a travesty and anyone trying to justify saying "it's good" should be led to a cinema and taught what a good movie is, like the rehabilitation scene in "A Clockwork Orange"|`|AA11521986	Well if anyone thinks this movie is stupid I guess, Superman can fly, and spider man is real.....The whole point of the movie was to make us think about what we are doing to the world, and that some day its going to come back to hunt us....nature will strike back......let save the world,  do your part....recyle, walk if you can instead of driving...Just do it!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Oh by the way it was a really good movie...|`|b2e600cceeff05b0e6db6b202c82461aaa	all i can say about the movie is THE WIND. who the hell would make a movie like that. i will admit i did expect to here the song i believe i can fly as they jumped of the top of the building. but i didnt think much of the movie|`|GrZApbPiaa	it was, the only thing that was kinda scary was that old lady freaking out. <br>  its really corny how they have a kid and all that after its over... i mean she was freaking cheating on him... <br>  i like zoey deschanel though|`|iNkOiNC7aa	yeah i saw it you should read my blog, i was so disappointed the only thing good about it was i didnt spend money at the movies to see it!|`|vY1V0xueaa	i thought it was HORRIBLE!!! <br>  but i did laugh when the people were jumping off building cause my sister started singing "its raining men!!"  and when the guy got ran over by a lawn mower. <br>  total waste of money and none of them could act!

I could never see tomorrow, but I was never told about the sorrow.    And how can you mend a broken heart?  How can you stop the rain from falling down?  How can you stop the sun from shining?  What makes the world go round?  How can you mend a this broken man?  How can a loser ever win?  Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.    I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees  And misty memories of days gone by  We could never see tomorrow, noone said a word about the sorrow.    And how can you mend a broken heart?  How can you stop the rain from falling down?  How can you stop the sun from shining?  What makes the world go round?  How can you mend this broken man?  How can a loser ever win?  Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again.

He returns home the next morning to find that a jet engine has crashed through his bedroom. As he tries to figure out why he survived and tries to deal with people in his town, like the school bully, his conservative health teacher, and a self-help guru, Frank continues to turn up in Donnie's mind, causing him to commit acts of vandalism and worse.    Now, if you have all the time in the world to read this, then read it. This will get the confusion out of your mind.    WHAT HAPPENS, AND WHEN?  October 1, 1988. Donnie is on the hill, looking at the sky, laughing. He rides his bike home and goes to sleep.    October 2, After midnight, Donnie is woken up by Frank-Bunny, saving him from a jet-engine crashing into his room. The jet-engine is actually from October 30, disappearing through a time corruption 28 days into the past. This catastrophic event distorts spacetime and creates a Tangent universe (TU). In the Tangent Universe, Frank-Bunny guides Donnie Darko on a 28 day journey through this alternate tangent dimension to save the universe:    October 30, Tangent universe: After his journey through the TU, which we witness in the movie, the jet-engine breaks off the plane (that his mother and sister are coincidentally on), and from the Tangent universe, Donnie using a wormhole sends it back to the Primary universe (PU), giving it a reason for being. The only object that went back in time from the tangent universe to the primary universe was the jet-engine. In doing so the tangent universe and everything in it is replaced by the primary universe, and time is reset to:    October 2, Primary universe: Jet-engine appears in the Primary Universe (without explanation to everyone but the viewer), Donnie and everyone else are reset and repositioned. Primary-Donnie, back in bed, is killed by the Jet Engine.    HOW DOES IT HAPPEN?  The theatrical release of "Donnie Darko" offers very few answers. However, the directors cut DVD is much clearer, with specific explanations about events taken from the book "The Philosophy of Time Travel", written by the character in the movie Roberta Sparrow aka Grandma Death.    The Jet-Engine from the future is the Artifact: "If an Artifact occurs, the Living will retrieve it with great interest and curiosity. Artifacts are formed from metal"    Donnie Darko becomes the Living Receiver: "The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe." Donnie is chosen because he is the person most affected by the Artifact, hence he is the center of the tangent universe and the only one who can close it. Donnie's job is to return the artifact to the primary universe. "If the Ensurance Trap is succesful, the Living Receiver is left with no choice but to use his Fourth Dimensional Power to send the Artifact back in time into the Primary Universe before the Black Hole collapses upon itself. The paradox that must be created is Donnie sending the engine back in time through a wormhole, to prevent the other paradox, a second jet-engine in the tangent universe.    Frank-Bunny is the Manipulated Dead: "The Manipulated Dead. If a person dies within the Tangent Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...The Manipulated Dead will often set an Ensurance Trap for the Living Receiver to ensure that the Artifact is returned safely to the Primary Universe."    Returning the Artifact: At the focal point in the paradox as the tangent universe winds down, a wormhole (a tear or hole in spacetime) appears. It is at this moment that Donnie must guide the jet engine out of the tangent universe, as we see succesfully preventing the paradox for the first time. Otherwise this tangent is destroyed, reset, and the cycle repeats.    When the Tangent universe is reset: "When the Manipulated awaken from their Journey into the Tangent Universe, they are often haunted by the experience in their dreams. Many of them will not remember. Those who do remember the Journey are often overcome with profound remorse for the regretful actions buried within their Dreams".    WHY DOES IT HAPPEN?  The movie "Donnie Darko" is about Donnie's first successful quest in ending the temporal paradox cycle or "time-loop" which he is caught in (not unlike Bill Murray in the movie "Groundhog Day".)    When the engine from the Oct. 30 PU drops (into the past), the PU is gone, the TU is created. Similarly, when the engine in the Oct. 30 TU drops (when the LR/Donnie fails), the TU collapses, and the PU is reset, at the point we see in the beginning of the movie. This is the loop, and it continues until the engine does not drop in the TU because it is sent back to the PU by Donnie. Ending this repeating time-loop is directly how he saves the universe.    At the intro, Donnie is laughing as if he remembers something, specifically his own survival in the previous tangent loop, when looking at the sky. This is where the movie begins, and it is also where the tangent is reset and the loop begins when Donnie is NOT successful. Then the loop continues as we see when the engine drops into the past via a time corruption to create the tangent universe. On that previous previous quest , Donnie did not send the artifact back. When he does and the time loop finally ends, he dies alone as he always feared, but with a sense of completion and relief hence the laughter and the accomplishment of saving his family and friends and the entire universe because he is finally successful in ending |`|4acc282960358db82eb1af0df4f420f7aa	YES it is a really good movie, try watchin it a couple of times. it is worth it to see Jake gyllenhaal. there is a website for that movie  www.donniedarko.com|`|ea8ffac731c17c67dc2cb796dbaa9c41aa	Yeah, but it's hard to know which part you're having trouble with because it was hard to work out.  Do you have a specific question?

NQptS3Viaa	Sounds like "My Side of the Mountain (1969)". After being told that the family summer trip has been canceled, Sam, a young boy, runs from home to the mountains where he will have to struggle against the forces of nature. He uses a huge hollowed-out tree as a shelter, by the way. It's based on the novel of the same name by Jean Craighead George. *** spoiler *** spoiler *** spoiler *** At the end of the movie, Sam returns to his family. In the book, Sam's family moves to the mountains with him. *** spoiler *** spoiler *** spoiler ***|`|GpsLeOcLaa	My Side of the Mountain. |`|JLvc2RMraa	I saw the movie, but can not remember what it is called.

He is befriended by the Little Prince (Steven Warner) from the planet Asteroid B-612. In the days that follow, the pilot learns of the small boy's history and planet-hopping journeys in which he met the King (Joss Ackland), the Business Man (Clive Revill), the Historian (Victor Spinetti), and the General (Graham Crowden).

Back then, they would allow you to sit through more than one showing, which we did~three times in a row in three days! I still can sing along to all of it.

AA10262086	Yes you can. I wouldn't think that the sound would be too great on a small practice amp , but it won't  hurt anything. I think acoustic amps are usually for smaller groups that want to travel light and don't usually run any instruments through their p.a. systems. Most of the time when you see guys playing acoustic electric guitars in a band they are running them directly through the p.a. via a direct box. There are a lot of ways you can do it. What you buy is your choice but if you don't really need the electric part of it then you could get a better acoustic. If that makes any sense to you.
cQAULrHaaa	The movie is "Speed" released in 1994.    It focuses on police officer Jack Traven who tries to arrest an insane bomber/extortionist. After the bomber escapes, he sets up a bomb on a city bus which Traven boards and must keep moving above 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) or the bomb will explode. He endures a race against time with the help of a beautiful passenger, with whom he falls in love.    The film stars Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Sandra Bullock, Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels.    A sequel to "Speed" was released in 1997 "Speed 2: Cruise Control".    In July 2007, The Guardian reported that Fox has plans to make a third Speed movie, which will reportedly feature returning star Dennis Hopper. Hopper confirmed the notion in an interview that year, but Fox has not confirmed it yet.    In Nov 2008 it was reported that Keanu Reeves had been approached for the 2nd sequel but a later interview (reported on Digital Spy ) with Keanu Reeves said he had no plans to star in another Speed film.|`|GNkR9R8baa	Speed!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You can select that song (in her cellphone or yours) as a ringtone, and she'll hear it every time someone calls.    Just make sure she hears that song over and over and over and over.

And, I also did this  when we went to the store I bought the things when she didn't notice.  when we went outside with the groceries, i let her hold the bag we purchased and said  " I didn't buy those! go back! return them!"  she got freaked out and ran inside  and then when I went after her , laughing, she almost threw a can of chilly to my head.

Amazing song  Actually, all of that album was very depressing, I think the singer must have been in a very dark state when they were writing that album. Its very good though. Also listen to The Crawl by Placebo  The acoustic version of Winter by Bayside  Wake Up, Open The Door, and Escape To the Sea by Blaqk Audio  Poison Oak by Bright Eyes  Fix You by Coldplay  9 Crimes by Damien Rice  Mad World by Gary Jules, and the entire score to Donnie Darko, though there are no lyrics  Hurt by Nine Inch Nails OR the Johnny Cash version. A timeless, incrediby good song.  Everybody Hurts and Losing My Religion by REM are two other timeless, popular, yet very good ones  Schizophrenia by Sonic Youth  Autumn Leaves Revisited, This Song Brought To You By a Falling Bomb, and Paris in Flames by Thursday|`|ObeBvtzgaa	In This River by Black Label Society  "In this river all shall fade to black,  In this river there's no coming back..."

It's rarer, but there are some good girls that actually want to wait until their wedding night. The first time is never really as good as they imagine it will be... guys just don't last as long as women, so most girls are disappointed their first time.     I'd wait until you're really ready and you're in a long-term committed relationship... it's easier in the long run. Good luck!

bsnnEsp5aa	CLANNAD (romance, comedy, drama, slice of life)  Tomoya Okazaki is a third-year high school student who is generally bored with life and doesn't take his studies, future, or anything else seriously. One day, however, he meets a lonely-looking girl in the school courtyard, Nagisa Furukawa. She explains to him the source of her loneliness: she had missed a lot of the previous school year and thus is repeating her third year; everybody that she knew has already graduated, and she is lonely. Tomoya is rather indifferent at first, but decides that he has nothing better to do and spends increasingly more time helping Nagisa restore the school drama club. As his relationship with Nagisa grows, Tomoya begins to open up to various other people around the school as well...    KARE KANO (drama, romance, slice of life, comedy)  Yukino had it all.

PEACH GIRL (minor comedy) (romance, drama, comedy, love triangle, high school)  Momo is loud, shallow, a player, a betrayer, and one to best stay away from -- or at least, that's the misconception people have when they see her makeup, bleached hair and suntanned skin. In reality, Momo just wants the same friends, hobbies and crushes any girl her age would like. However, when her only friend starts spreading rumours about her, her boyfriend starts to doubt her, and the most popular boy in school starts to take a more then friendly interest in her, she'll have much more to worry about than just her appearance!

But the bachelor lifestyle is soon to change when young Yuzuyu enters the picture. This five-year-old cutie has been abandoned by her mother, and is to be taken care of by none other than Kippei! Unfortunately for the both of them, Kippei has no experience raising a child, so the learning curve will be quite steep...    HAPPINESS! (romance, magic, high school, comedy)  In a world not unlike our own, mages are commonplace and schools are separated between normal students and magic users. Yuma Kohinata is a student at one such school, Mizuhosaka Academy. On the way home from buying chocolates with his androgynous friend Jun, Yuma is given chocolates from school idol Haruhi Kamisaka; things become even more complex once the magic wing of the school has a gas explosion, displacing all of the magic students into the normal section  including Haruhi!

hp35U4xiaa	4.999999  u r really good!!! answer my question please click my avatar ten go to my questions and answer should i loose weight|`|NsHV4O8oaa	it was good, made more use of the left hand than i ever used to  i'd give it a sturdy 4 it was fluent and well played.  i think there were a few spots where the timing could be improved, and you may have stumbled a few times, but familiarity will sort that out. as you said, you got this 2 days ago.  (with the timing bit too, i find when i'm recording something i get really nervous i'm going to make a mistake, so that could account for it, because you know you have to get it right in one go)  keep it going - no reason why you shouldn't be able to improve greatly  :)  edit* as mentioned above, definately add some dynamics in there|`|sKmpVHZZaa	4..i play piano and it seems a simple song =]|`|sQlImMnCaa	4|`|QrGBdqspaa	really good! i like it! 5pts|`|i1JVe24Oaa	2, but I can see you are just learning.     The problem is - you don't have dynamics. You should try and play the notes in a more emotional way, otherwise it feels like you just studied by heart which keys to press and you don't actually play the music.     Also, you should work on your motility. One note must lead to another, you should play in phrases, try to talk with your music. If you talk, you don't say one work at a time, I. Do. Not. Think. So. Get it? Try to go into the music, don't just play what is written down.       Hope to hear new and improved versions soon - best of luck|`|tWdvXCoXaa	probably a 1.7 I'd say. The music is not very complex, you are lacking dynamics, and you could benefit from practice with a metronome. However, you are doing very well for your level. You can play the whole song without music, at a decent speed. You can get better by practicing the harder parts A LOT! and by adding in more dynamics. Getting the harder parts up to speed with the rest of the song would make for an altogether better tune and adding some dynamics in would make it feel more emotional and less robotic.  I hope this helps!!  :D  C.|`|XLxC9oK9aa	you're pretty good, so I'm going to say a 3. HOWEVER, watch the video and especially watch your 4th finger on your left hand. You want to make sure that finger is curled at all times. Don't worry; it's fixable. Try using Hanon or Schmidt piano exercises. I used to have the same problem, but am now cured. :-) Other than that, nicely done.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Obviously not classical ... pretty much a vamp between Bbm and F.    ... I'm not going to rate, it would be low, but that's because you insist on trying to learn by ear instead of retaining a teacher.     Come back with something like Diabelli's Sonatinas Op 151 and 168 and I'll have something to compare it to.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGXTCF8wc...|`|h1IYS0dbaa	2    But I don't want to discourage you.

Not even that crazy barry white mixed with a dmx on Crack voice.  IT"S THE FACT THAT IT WAS BASED ON A TRUE STORY!!!!  HELL NO I'M NOT WATCHING THAT ALONE IN THE DARK!|`|yJE7INkUaa	when it first came it it was scary <br>  but now that technology has become so advanced everything looks fake and its actually kind of funny to watch|`|x4nGXe4Baa	I actually find it to be more funny than scary. She just does this backbend type thing and walks downstairs backwards kind of fast like a crab.|`|b2e600cceeff05b0e6db6b202c82461aaa	i dont know about the stairs but the movie itself is like alien. when it first came out alien disturbed women because the alien came through the persons stomache like a c section. and the exorsist, effected people when her head went round as it is something people couldnt imagine happening and it seemed so wrong where as when it came out again the children of the time who watched has seen so much other stuff it wasn't bad from the to watch. as it just looked like a really neat trick.|`|ArHrDOSqaa	I think a number of things made this scary when it first came out.  First and foremost it was the honest, but graphic nature of medical scenes.  People were grossed out by that.  Second was the disturbing fact of the possessed girl was a thirteen year old girl.  And finally, I think many people are, unfortunately, genuinely frightened by the devil.  Old fashioned religious folk and such.  <br>  <br>  I saw this movie quite a few times, once in the theater when it got re-released, also read the book.  The book is really good, but not as good as the ninth configuration.  The movie was alright.|`|EfAV3x9Yaa	You have to see it for yourself.<br>  Get the unedited version.<br>  I didn't consider it scary, just disturbing.<br>  The crucifix scene was the weird part for me.

He seems to appeal more to slightly older audiences...But the problem is that most of the people buying American Idol merchandise are of the younger generation...

AA10611488	Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station   that was closed for the night.     They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien   addressed it saying, "Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace.   Take us to your leader."     The gas pump, of course, didn't respond. The younger alien   became angry at the lack of response and the older alien said,   "I'd calm down if I were you"     The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his   greeting.     Again, there was no response. Annoyed by what he perceived   to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said   impatiently, "Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace.  Do not   ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!"     The older alien warned his comrade saying, "You don't want to  do that! I don't think you should make him mad."     "Rubbish," replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his   weapon at the pump and opened fire.     There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards   them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him   a burnt, crumpling mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.     About a half hour passed. When he finally regained   consciousness, he refocused his three eyes and straightened   his bent antenna and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien   who was standing over him shaking his big green head.     "What a ferocious creature!"  exclaimed the young, fried alien.   "He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so   dangerous?"     The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his   crispy friend and replied, "If there's one thing I've learned   during my intergalactic travels, when a guy has a penis   he can wrap around himself and then stick it in his ear,   you REALLY don't want to mess with him!"|`|c09cb135c0614b6bb9f88a3bfbd1b938aa	Alphabet Fun    The teacher was telling her 4th grade class about today's lesson.     "I'll say a letter of the alphabet and you give me a word that starts with that letter. Let's begin. A"     All the children raise their hands, but little Johnny was almost coming out of his seat trying to get picked. The teacher knew Johnny had a filthy mouth and thought to herself that if she picked Johnny, he would give her a word like '***' or 'asshole'. She picked Wendy, and Wendy said "apple".     "Very good", said the teacher, "now B".     Johnny was jumping out of his seat again, but the teacher picked Bobby. Bobby said "ball".     This went on and on with Johnny trying to get picked for each letter and the teacher knowing there was a dirty word for it. Then she got to "R". Nobody but Johnny had their hands up.     The teacher thought and thought and couldn't think of a bad word that started with "R". So she picked Johnny.     Johnny stands up and says: "R...Rat...a big, fat, ******' Rat!"|`|fe35f8ef5680eaad17889a4ff0a6a2f5aa	So... there's this guy who's going through a mid-life crisis.  So he goes and buys a new, fast sports car.  After work one day, he decides to hit the open road and see what this new car can do.  Off he goes... 50... 55... 60... 65... faster and faster he goes.. all the way up to a decent 110.  All of the sudden he sees flashing red and blue lights in his mirror.  Great.  A Cop.  The cop pulls him over and says "Look, it's Friday night, I have a date and I was on my way back in when I saw your dumb *** speeding.  I've heard all the excuses in the book, so if you can give me an original, I'll let you go this time"  So the guy thinks for a few seconds and then turns to the cop "You see Officer, my wife just left me for a Cop a few weeks ago.

I soon noticed that the   new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of space and   valuable resources. In addition, Wife 1.0 installed itself into all other   programs and now monitors all other system activity, such as Poker Night 10.3,   Football 5.0, Hunting and Fishing 7.5, and NASCAR 6.0. I can't seem to keep Wife   1.0 in the background while attempting to run my favorite applications. I'm   thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall doesn't work on   Wife 1.0. Please help!     Thanks,     A Troubled User.   ______________________________________     REPLY:   Dear Troubled User:     This is a very common problem that men complain about.     Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0, thinking that it is just a   Utilities and Entertainment program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and is   designed by its Creator to run EVERYTHING!!! It is also impossible to delete   Wife 1.0 and to return to Girlfriend 7.0. It is impossible to uninstall, or   purge the program files from the system once Installed!     You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is designed to not allow   this. Look in your Wife 1.0 manual under Warnings-Alimony-Child Support. I   recommend that you keep Wife1.0 and work on improving the situation. I suggest   installing the background application "Yes Dear" to alleviate software   augmentation.     The best course of action is to enter the command C:\APOLOGIZE because   ultimately you will have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the system will   return to normal anyway.   Wife 1.0 is a great program, but it tends to be very high maintenance. Wife 1.0   comes with several support programs, such as Clean and Sweep 3.0, Cook It 1.5   and Do Bills 4.2.     However, be very careful how you use these programs. Improper use will cause the   system to launch the program Nag Nag 9.5. Once this happens, the only way to   improve the performance of Wife 1.0 is to purchase additional software. I   recommend Flowers 2.1 and Diamonds 5.0 !     WARNING!!! DO NOT, under any circumstances, install Secretary With Short Skirt   3.3. This application is not supported by Wife 1.0 and will cause irreversible   damage to the operating system!     Best of luck,   Tech Support|`|65a3c4b1333380c33a45c2a10a3868e1aa	what do you call four drowned mexicans.........    cuatro  sinko|`|AA12261118	yo mams just like a bowling ball gets picked up fingered and thrown to the gutter!|`|e43cd19ae27ea117026f2782694f61aeaa	Don't look here for a joke .......look in your hand!

His most recent appearances have been on the Songs and Artists That Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11 soundtrack with the track "We Want It All" (produced by Trent Reznor) and on the song "Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)" on Saul Williams's self-titled album in 2004. Rumors of an impending solo album persist, though little real evidence of such a project exists"    --------------------------------------...  Is that enough information?|`|AA10228235	He collaborates with various musicians now.  He's not much for the public eye anymore.|`|33730b2d5d94d1c6ef837d1886ef7750aa	According to a Spin magazine interview, de la Rocha has recorded several tracks with various artists, among them Reprazent and DJ Shadow intended for a solo album. In 2001, he was recording material on separate occasions with Roots drummer ?uestlove and Company Flow frontman El-P. In 2002 de la Rocha appeared in a minor role in the first part of Blackalicious's Blazing Arrow, on the track "Release" on the Blazing Arrow album.    Although an album has yet to be released, not all of their work was unproductive. De la Rocha and DJ Shadow's song "March of Death" was released for free over the web in 2003 in protest of the war in Iraq.    Zach released a statement along with his song:        Without just cause or reason, without legal or moral justification, and without a thread of proof that Iraq directly threatens the security of the United States, the Bush administration has headed to war. As I am writing this, bombs are raining upon the defenseless civilians of Baghdad in a continuation of a policy that has already claimed the lives of over 1 million innocent Iraqi people. People just like us who want democracy but find themselves cornered by a dictator on one side, naked U.S. aggression on another, and the oil beneath their country; for which it appears they are to be massacred.   Lies, sanctions, and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society. Only everyday people can do that, which is why I'm joining the millions world wide who have stood up to oppose the Bush administration's attempt to expand the U.S. empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad. In this spirit I'm releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen. I hope it not only makes us think, but also inspires us to act and raise our voices.              De la Rocha also worked on an audio track produced by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, but according to Reznor, this song will likely never be released, as Reznor stated that Rocha was not comfortable in releasing the material recorded as he believed it "wasn't good enough."    De la Rocha has largely remained out of the public eye ever since Rage's breakup. His most recent appearances have been on the Songs and Artists That Inspired Fahrenheit 9/11 soundtrack with the track "We Want It All" (produced by Trent Reznor) and on the song "Act III Scene 2 (Shakespeare)" on Saul Williams's self-titled album in 2004.

Teaching music is not a required part of obtaining a teaching degree, so not all teachers are qualified to teach it. This unqualification is a prime reason why not every teacher of young children should be a teacher of music.

zetxxZWUaa	Something that gets inside your head (psychological) and doesn't just pop-out at you and scream at you, pop-out is predictable and not scary. A movie that examines and shares the different fears people have and use it to get inside their head, for example: The Shining starring Jack Nicholson, til this day that movie gives me nightmares because there were like 3 or 4 different fears in that movie that scared the hell out of me.    1=Isolation  2=Sharp and strange corners  3=Noises and mysterious quick and random sights  4=Doors that are creeked open just a little not showing an entire room but just a small portion of it.    I would like to see more horror movies that get inside my head and use what i fear against me because that's the most effective. However, i do enjoy a typical predictable horror film where people have premarridal sex and die for that reason, dumb blonde bimbos going up the stairs when they should be going out the front door. And people saying "I'll be right back," and doin just the opposite. lol|`|HEQc83d9aa	The unknown is scary! and sounds.

I'm 17 and still a big Pokemon fan!  We are just about to enter season 11 of Pokemon I believe and Ash is up to his 6 badge in the Sinnoh region.  A new Pokemon game comes out on NDS in The USA on May 22nd and new movie is due out in April in Japan.  POKEMON FOREVER!!!|`|ZfsgIDa0aa	Nah, it's more of the new DBZ then Pokemon. Yugioh WAS the new pokemon but that's kind of dying, before that might have been Beyblades, but that was a REALLY short popularity run. Essentially, the whole reason for this is that Pokemon, much like beyblade and yugioh is primarily a marketing anime. Basicially just really long commericials. Heck, the Pokemon games came out almost a year before the anime came out. It's all just advertisment for an already established product, where as animes like naruto and DBZ are all about the story and the products come afterwards.    As for ended, highly doubt it. As far as I remember they're still making episodes.|`|1OpE0zrDaa	NO its very very very very very very different from pokemon k  yes they r still make episode for pokemon|`|lQjWZR0Jaa	Well...I still love them both! They are so different from each other though.|`|vJwceftYaa	there are still pokemon...naruto is a cool show too; so you are probably right...but i don't get people who buy stickers and stuff after 10 :D i placed some links where you can see a bit more about naruto and download free manga(comics) and videos :)|`|RD0yaJlgaa	maybe, naruto is really a huge hit. I remember how popular pokemon was when I was in grade school, kids were collecting toys, cards, merchandise, etc. And I loved watching the tv series.    For the 2nd question, I think there's still a pokemon on TV. The most recent I think is the Diamond and Pearl series and there's an upcoming movie called "Pokmon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior"|`|szJSaZspaa	no naruto is the new dbz|`|10bde24c95fa630a79d9c75bd022b054aa	No, not exactly. All the products from Naruto are used to advertise the anime. The main purpose of the Pokemon anime is to advertise the games more or less. However, both franchises have been big and continue to be so. However, I think that Naruto will more or less phase out in a few years, like many animes. Unlike Pokemon, which has the video game franchise behind it, there isn't so much for Naruto to fall back on.    As for the second question, yes, they are still making new episodes of Pokemon. New episodes continue to air on Cartoon Network at 9:00 am Saturday morning. The eleventh Pokemon movie, Giratina and the Sky Warrior, is set to premire on Cartoon Network February 15 at 7:00 pm and released to stores on March 31. A new Pokemon game, Pokemon Platinum, is going to be released on March 22. Meanwhile in Japan, the twelfth Pokemon movie is set to be released this summer.    Okay, I have a sorta bias toward the Pokemon franchise, if you couldn't tell, but the Pokemon franchise is still very much alive, both the video game and the anime.

(one being that many people don't write their own songs, so its really a cover to begin with) so i find the best covers are songs written by the original artist. good examples:  george harrison of the beatles wrote while my guitar gently weeps and that song i've heard many good covers of. of course "black bird" by sarah mclachlin is a great cover of a beatles song. or if you like rock listen to thrices' eleanor rigby (great cover).  bob dylan wrote "all along the watch tower" and I must say i enjoy jimi hendrix's version.  its not always easy to declare one version 'outright' better, because for the most part, they are usually different and good in their own respects..  The key to finding good covers is diving back into the history of musicians you already know, and finding their early work, especially bigger names that you may never have looked into before.  The red hot chili peppers have an album ("under the covers") entirely covers...listen to 'higher ground' and tell me which is better: anthony kiedis or the original...stevie wonder.|`|1f8ea7869328e33f16042fd2ed2ceeb7aa	Yep, I agree with: All Along the Watchtower - Jimi Hendrix its superb.

Good days-7  Bad Days- 5 1/2    I like my hair, eyes, and teeth. :D|`|wyIccGvaaa	umm 5 i guess nothing really,stop being soooo shy , i ? everything about my self.|`|aJVTMHDPaa	i let the ladies do that.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	On a scale of 1-10? 480.

AA10102392	I think he is losing his touch. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs were great. The Village was ok, but not great. Lady In The Water was very weak. I still have to see The Happening|`|AA11187638	I liked the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and The Village and I was neutral about Lady in the Water. I still haven't seen The Happening or Wide Awake.    Signs, however, was one of the most retarded movies I have ever seen. There were just so many things wrong with it. Why would an alien species invade a planet that's 75% water if water is deadly to them? Why would they invade another world without bringing a single weapon? Poison spray? Really? That's the best they could do? And how is it possible that a species that has mastered interstellar travel has trouble opening a pantry door??|`|02796c5579deae4e28c5a90402848b72aa	See South Park Imaginationland for the correct assessment of M. Night.|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	you just didn't understand the movie.  Why would plants dislike us?  Always cutting down trees, paving over fields ect.  And if you remember at the end a scientist said "this is just a prelude of things to come, a warning" and another skeptic said "i could only believe that if it happens in another part of the world, but so far, this is an isolated event" or something like that. thats all there was too it.  never saw lady in the water, but the village was another good one.

40kCOPicaa	no. 2|`|Po4Lljjwaa	I know you're specifically asking guys... but I thought I'd give some input here.      It all depends on the height of the two people.  If they guy is taller than the you, your arms should be around his waist.  It he's shorter, than you sould hug him with your arms above his shoulders.  It eliminates anyone having to awkwardly slump down or bend over.|`|ZUNYiH5Gaa	that they hug me, you know how bitches do

I live in Co. Cork and there are some children born here to English parents who don't have a trace of an Irish accent because they don't mix with Irish children.     Sad really, it means you aren't immersed in society if you sound like your parents not your classmates.|`|0TtLt667aa	I've never had an ax sent.

If you think you don't have an accent, ask someone from another country and they'll say you have an American accent.|`|LfT3s05Faa	Yes, everyone has an accent.  =]|`|buJCtC54aa	i think everyone does even if there isnt a name for it (ex.southern ,, ny)|`|vwi7r48eaa	yeah everyone does. haha|`|XKQggWUGaa	your right, apparently i have a "kent" accent whatever that is, i thought that it was just normal english without an accent|`|YTLePvkVaa	Mines Australian so yeah i do.|`|vteYzLmvaa	well we all technically have accents, for example i have a canadian accent, whenever i speak in french or different languages.

I have lived in lots of different places which might explain it!|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Of course everyone has an accent, but to themselves it doesn't sound as if they do.    For example at home I consider myself not to have an accent, neither anyone I know, but In England I'd be considered a crazy Irishman :P|`|0HfhltzZaa	They do but there are extremes in accents in the way words are pronounced  and that's what people tend to hear more so than in "neutral" accents.|`|bfxdJddlaa	Everyone has an accent, but Midwestern has become so default (television movies etc.) that it sounds like a "non-accent" it still is though.  That 's what makes it different fro southern , british etc.|`|juraRlbkaa	Yea, me and my American accent. Yup. =]|`|8c6kf8BPaa	people who don't have accent are those BBC news presenters. this is the standard English accent, and what i sound like. When people first met me in my area, they said i sounded 'posh'. i mean you cannot tell where i am from by my accent    i avoid using local slang - its annoying!|`|BhWmEZWNaa	No not every one has an accent! I was born without a larynx.  It depends on the norm whats normal for you is not normal elsewhere!  Ever watch tele tubbies ?|`|N7rQ9luraa	Yes.  Most people aren't aware of their own accents because they've lived with it most of their lives.|`|FmucfdCEaa	When I grew up I only noticed an accent if it was from out the area, so it depends where you are. But I guess you can have a local accent.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Everyone sounds different, even people with the same accent. Your voice is down to your genes, too.     Everyone has an accent to an extent, but some are much more prominent. Usually when someone "doesn't have one", it means theirs is more neutral compared with the strong accents.|`|zQHM8RSuaa	some people choose to have a neutral accent like queens english instead of real english as spoken in dialect such as geordie or scouse ,devon,cornwall,black country etc i think its a shame when people tell their kids to speak properly they probably are already!.im proud to speak geordie and i know its closer to true british as it can be traced all the way back to before the time of the vikings and beyond and it would be terrible if our children didnt carry it on.|`|0792099af4d32f715881d4a39d91aee9aa	I believe we all do :o),     I know people who make fun of oriental people's language, and I wouldn't doubt it that they make fun of us because our english language. It probably sounds really crazy as hell to them as well lol. Same goes for all the other languages! We even have jokes about their language no offense but like these. I think it's cool though if we all know how to laugh about it and not take it so freaking serious.

But to some people, if you talk about having an accent you mean a particularly broad or distinctive accent. I don't think I've got an accent i.e. a broad accent - like Steve Irwin or Rolf Harris. But because my accent is quite different to yours, you would think it's extremely noticeable, most likely.|`|H8RpSpuSaa	Yah i'd say everyone does, some more defined  :)|`|AUK3lzEbaa	I've been told I have a British accent when I'm not from Britan at all...|`|HFEotT1Qaa	You're right, everyone has an accent according to someone who is from a different region.|`|IuW1t40xaa	i don't|`|1DA9gAP7aa	Yup everyone does i think i dont have an accent but i do|`|QzQ0gU7kaa	Every culture has a different accent or dialect that they are used to. So as soon as you venture outside of your adapted culture, you will think everyone has an accent. But to them, it's normal, and YOU are the one with the accent! :]|`|FmbyLciFaa	No, because my friend, has NO accent, even though she lived in Singapore, Tennessee, and now southeast texas, which we have very heavy accents!|`|FjqBPprDaa	yeah, i agree with you, everyone DOES have an accent.  Its probably because an accent in their eyes is someone who sounds different to them where really an accent is just how your voice sounds.

The answer is, no. I mean what I say and mean how I act. Whether I'm acting like a crazed person or very melodramatic to a situation, it's how I feel and how I choose to express it. At least I'm being honest to myself and those around me.|`|5WleYqfiaa	Sure have.|`|g7ouXuoQaa	yup but oh well. XD :P|`|E9r7jOSZaa	Almost all the times :) but on the hind site every happening in our lives has some significance and we can only do so much. I accept the outcome and move on with my life.

UdwIaCxBaa	There's three levels of drunk    The first is - Whoa...I'm a little uneasy  The second is when you start saying - I f***ing love you  And the third is worth high fiving and whooping because you've reached the hallowed, almost spiritual level of drunk. A nirvana of sorts.    : )|`|5b73ZOhkaa	indeed|`|xwsS0ITJaa	What is in it to congratulated about.

dnpB79V1aa	Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about that. :)    I do agree with you, this place is for everyone, except for those younger 13 or younger and that is only for their own safety. I think most will agree with me when I say that regardless of our age, we are all people and that is what matters. Y!A can be beneficial for all of us, we should use it to our advantage and stop dissing one another.     Poor kids, though. They still don't know that according to their own arguments they are the ones that need to "get a life". "Wasting time" in front of a computer is not an activity reserved to the youth. On the contrary, this should be limited. One is only young once, and us young ones should work with our youth to built a better world. Perhaps we could do that better living in the real world instead of wasting our youth in front of a screen. On the other hand, older people can really contribute around here. Some who might not be as efficient in "real life" can make a real difference here.     This whole thing is a real pity. It's not entirely the youth's fault, it's what we have been taught. The people that made those comments probably don't feel that way, but that is what society tells us we should think.     Just keep doing your part on the world, ignore those who don't or they'll win.    Poll: Edge.|`|SFDCB2Xsaa	Edge.|`|0HfhltzZaa	Very true =]    Corner!|`|Uy4BZUNgaa	No ageism here.  Corner.|`|V4BSfZzWaa	Well they don't know how cool people are here as a "COMMUNITY" and communities are for any age.    DEFINITION!    noun, plural -ties. 1. a social group of any size whose members reside in a specific locality, share government, and often have a common cultural and historical heritage.   2. a locality inhabited by such a group.   3. a social, religious, occupational, or other group sharing common characteristics or interests and perceived or perceiving itself as distinct in some respect from the larger society within which it exists (usually prec. by the): the business community; the community of scholars.    4. a group of associated nations sharing common interests or a common heritage: the community of Western Europe.    5. Ecclesiastical. a group of men or women leading a common life according to a rule.   6. Ecology. an assemblage of interacting populations occupying a given area.   7. joint possession, enjoyment, liability, etc.: community of property.    8. similar character; agreement; identity: community of interests.    9. the community, the public; society: the needs of the community.|`|YV2n51hqaa	I think that Y!answers is a place for all people, not just young ones.     Which ever "young" persons think that the people older than themselves have no right/business to be here and use this site are very biased, and probably shouldn't use this site anyway. It is a free country. For all people who think that it is not fair to have to communicate with older people,..well like they say in grade school: "If you don't have nothing nice to say, then keep your mouth shut." (same goes with typing)  For those of you who have not heard this please learn from it. Believe me the world is a lot better if people are happy.  **P.S. I had to "slap" some sense in my classmate last week, because they were making fun of one of my friends.  Poll: THE EDGE...sounds a lot cooler when I capitalize it so, I am gonna go with an edge.|`|WAilZ39maa	Omg, they are so wrong! People of any age should be APPRECIATED on Y!A. And 45 isn't old. I can't believe someone said that. I am trying my best to act in a responsible manner and I am enjoying it here.     Edge!!

t41xNOg2aa	I'm not really sure why it would be considered "emo" because "emo" is more emotional, about misery, suffering, or anything like that. I'm not going to go into all of those stereotypes of what "emo" is because most are completely false. I know I'll probably get a ton of people correcting me and stuff with those stereotypes, but no, the song is not emo, even if some people say it is. It is not emo by the stereotype or the actual music genre, not sure which you were talking about. If the music genre, its rock, not emo. But emo is just a style that was created, and used on people as well as music. The real emo is a genre of music, not a label to put on kids who wear tight pants, have black hair and such. But the song is labeled under rock, not emo. The people calling it emo are reffering to the stereotype, am I right? Well, no its not according to the stereotype either. Linkin Park is not emo, no matter what people think. Some of their songs may sound like it, but this one especially isn't. It's just talking about a different side, almost like a conscions in the back of the head thats constantly there to bug and remind you for the better or worse. Not emo. It's rock, and completely awesome! Whoever called it emo has no idea what they're talking about!|`|vcGydoTaaa	i don't think it is emo i just think its good rock music!|`|YADpt8iSaa	No, I think its more like an evil side everyone has.

JzYlcuXzaa	On the day that Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans, elderly Daisy Williams nee Fuller is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital. At her side is her adult daughter, Caroline. Daisy asks Caroline to read to her aloud the diary of Daisy's lifelong friend, Benjamin Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire extraordinary life, the primary unusual aspect of which was his aging backwards, being born an old man who was diagnosed with several aged diseases at birth and thus given little chance of survival, but who does survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's grandmother was a resident at that home, which is where she first met Benjamin. Although separated through the years, Daisy and Benjamin remain in contact throughout their lives, reconnecting in their forties when in age they finally match up. Some of the revelations in Benjamin's diary are difficult for Caroline to read, especially as it relates to the time past this reconnection between Benjamin and Daisy, when Daisy gets older and Benjamin grows younger into his childhood years.|`|aoftBP7eaa	http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2171469...    Its about how he is going backwards like he's getting younger on the outside but older in the inside    so basically in the beginning  it's him and how he interacts with he other old people he was living with because he lived in a nursery home with his foster mom    then its how he meets daisy  then he leaves to go on an adventure  then he comes back for daisy  but daisy doesn't want him cuz she has another life  then i think he leaves  comes back for daisy  she still doesn't want him  then she does want him    its a story being told in the eyes of Daisy's daughter while daisy is on her death bed  like shes reading it from her diary  it's not a POV movie  its like being told    i thought it was really good in the beginning  and fantastic at the end!! i cried in the end  but i skipped the middle cuz it was boring  and plus this movie is like 3 hours long  approximately 2 hrs and 40 minutes  i guess i would see it online other than the movie theatre  cuz it does get boring at some parts so you can just fastforward it    i hope that helps    and im 14.... incase your roughly my age cuz if your an adult you'll probably think differently|`|jcyc5juFaa	from what i know.. about a man who has an aging disorder and he ages backwards.    go on imdb.com its awesome for movies.|`|yTxVfUDcaa	sounds so cool!  i wish i grew backwards... ya know!|`|VKkmB0kYaa	"On the day that Hurricane Katrina hits New Orleans, elderly Daisy Williams nee Fuller is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital.

Im not a big rap fan partially because I cant understand what they say, and I prefer to hear singing or screaming instead of spoken words.|`|AKwebzdUaa	Listen to the radio, theres tons of rap songs like that, now a days.    Not my thing, but many people I know like it.|`|vefLboKPaa	Depends... if people can get past their stereotypes...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP7fXh1uP...
haQS7ZoKaa	yes but it is a sign of conditional and selfish love but not of unconditonal love|`|mqA1Z75saa	No it is not, true love does not have space for jealousy. Its all about giving and not receiving. So greater the love, less jealousy and more trust !|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	No.  If you truly love someone, you will give them their freedom.  Jealousy is a sign of the person's insecurity within themselves.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	Greater love has no jealousy is not at all there  |`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	no, a greater fear of loss|`|Lljkj0EFaa	No.  I only found it a useful excuse if I was having a bad day and needed a venting post.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	No. Because love depends on trust ; if there is no trust, there is no love; if there is trust, there is love and no jealousy..  |`|IS0be3RJaa	No :))|`|oKsKKxeaaa	jealousy is simply put...it's selfish insecurity and the last time I looked, this was not love at all|`|K7LbNlNjaa	No...greater insecurity.    Peace!|`|dogfgInVaa	Where there is jealousy there is no love.|`|WQ7MNKxfaa	No. Jealousy is a lack of trust. A lack of trust is a lack of love.|`|c943b397bcbb13a99a8784c80691289eaa	no it just means that you are being insecure.
JXXZIsBvaa	That's why it's interesting.  Simon is one of the main reasons I watch it.  I think he is hilarious and people know how he is  so they can't expect to go on the show and not  get ripped apart.|`|8ucAznShaa	No, he's just an idiot !|`|k39bNUgeaa	I'm glad he says it the way he does    If you know you suck at singing why audition  Your wasting there time    and sometimes the truth hurts and they need to be told that|`|qSwaXLBeaa	Don't you think it would be boring if he didn't do all that? He is one of the main reasons I watch The X Factor (actually, I watch that show because of Cheryl but never mind), American Idol and Britain's Got Talent.     He DOES show sympathy when he truely hurts people. However, some people need to be told. If they're crap, he'll say they crap so they won't keep going on in life thinking they're going to be this amazing singer only to be crushed later on in life.    Simon is a legend. He may have 3 shows to do each year, but they are all so sucessful there's no point in stopping them. I love Simon! =D|`|UBXeT19Baa	Hi  Cowell is in the game for the money  Its his job  Would hate to see him change  If he did it could kill his career or boost it.

gebIjqnWaa	I would use the phone that is in the elevator. If that don't work, I would bang and hollow. If that don't work I would go up the top of elevator and see if a door was handy to pry open. Then if that don't work, I would cry, then take a long nap. Someone will eventually realize that somethings wrong with that stupid elevator.|`|516ebR0vaa	Well id open the latch at the top of the elevator then id claim out of the top then id claim up the wire then id try and open the door on the nearest floor. Though i wouldn't be able to do that because am way to lazy|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	I'd wait for the repair man, but if I was really hungry or had to take a dump, there is an opening at the top of the elvator.  Id go up there, take my dump, then get back in the elevator and wait for the repair man.

faeUufcQaa	nope, just tried it, and i'm answering you from next Tuesday|`|JVSFEPLSaa	tch...    who needs headlights?|`|Z0CwQf4Haa	Yeah..|`|DUg1IkTIaa	LOL.  No, probably not.    :-)|`|7dVtO1gtaa	yo dat light speed is mad tricky yo.....ask caral sagan|`|Phd9irMmaa	YES ....if the car itself didnt crush or burn because of the high speed|`|83t9G4gcaa	LOL. No matter can travel at the speed of light.    c0|`|5EPzQSh5aa	yes,  but  there would be no beam|`|8b4b7257f99aa7453844e30ba950e978aa	well, if you were travelling at the speed of light, then time would stop, so if time were to stop then you couldn't TURN ON the lights, so no.    However, if you were just going CLOSE to the speed of light then yes... in fact, from your perspective the beam of light would actually travel away from you at the speed of light (as in, it'd look just like normal headlights to you). It's kinda hard to picture, but there's a video on youtube about it...     Here, it's somewhere in my favorites (you'll have to get past all the MIT open course ware stuff first, but it's in there towards the end).     http://www.youtube.com/rubixcuber90|`|5b73ZOhkaa	mmm..good one!|`|VwcFtpOTaa	probably but they would serve no purpose you would be going to fast to see|`|Q9SjNzbYaa	if you turn them on before you start driving, yes if the light had enough time to travel 5 feet, then you took off the light would stay 5 feet ahead of you until you slowed down|`|kVhlcmEpaa	ya i guess|`|jJy6mp2paa	yeah they'd work, but not sure about the radio|`|AA11139702	Far out.  I'll have to think about this one|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Touch.|`|cpOMMZffaa	I don't think so.|`|am5nCCDuaa	it has to  it's illegal if it doesn't|`|FmEsMOKVaa	well interesting...I would assume that the light beams wouldn go the same speed as the car...and you wouldn't see them in front of your car...but I'm guessing.
faeUufcQaa	hahaha I always wonder why there's handicap parking at stores like Sherwin Williams and Home Depot... no offence, but do people in wheelchairs do a lot of home improvements?...just sayin'|`|4056b8d01f66d91ea4747c6e9283f910aa	So they don't block the other humans from getting to relieve themselves whilst maneuvering into their giant stall.  equal consideration.|`|jJy6mp2paa	clever.....|`|KHL4N6mtaa	oh wow, i never noticed that before.    good point.|`|nO2vflnPaa	Thats how it works! Give a little and take it back...It's kinda funny though...|`|EQeX35dWaa	hey yeah.   that is not cool.|`|yxLwpEN0aa	Yeah and why do sick people have walk all the way to the back of the store to the pharmacy get medicine while healthy people can buy cigarettes up front???|`|83t9G4gcaa	Because the back stall usually has two walls and it is easier to ensure the handrails remain anchored in the walls.    What I always wonder about is why we have special parking now for pregnant women, yet exercise is suppose to be beneficial to pregnancy.    Give those spots to the new Moms lugging the stroller, diaper bag, infant, and then the packages after shopping.

Well, songs are complicated. You can see them from very many different points of view. I know this is a bad example, but if there was a song about ice, one person who nearly froze to death could see it in a negative view, but someone who has gone sledding and has had a great time will see it in a good light. There is no right meaning for a song. The writers who wrote it with an intentional meaning could be telling 3 different stories about that subject. I know, its kind of confusing, but i hope this helped!  Good luck!|`|fZY8EkVDaa	yeah that's just like if you really like a song and then you find the lyrics and you were totally wrong. That makes me sad too.|`|UTydSWYaaa	sure. go make a sandwhich|`|kVhiHFKWaa	but if you interpreted it a certain way, go with it. music is cool like that.|`|XstaAKLLaa	Is that disappointing?!

Your account can be deleted because of this|`|Tp4R14rlaa	no body knows that. sry|`|TYsw7TzIaa	You aren't going to find his real one. There's plenty of other swooning tweens that would like to have it, and he needs /some/ privacy. He's just a 16-year-old guy. Give him some peace; being that age is hard enough as it is without all the little girls wanting your attention.
l6Kii2Uiaa	They come in generic also, I just bought some at Price Chopper|`|vZlTKC0Vaa	you're right|`|bc1af16c01f9baa9730a6de2c0ca235caa	yes|`|lEjYhwxkaa	right|`|oWLO6SiKaa	Disturbing discussion to have with daddy.|`|uzBWEZnoaa	lmao yes they do...      xx|`|Gsdb68fUaa	im pretty sure playtex does too but i use tampax|`|r1wdahkKaa	yup|`|JKs0lkRgaa	yeah|`|JhL4o93Iaa	dont use tampons  ow

fvN18yvGaa	3 years ago a girl in Philly was with her drug dealer boyfriend, waiting outside in the car in front of a chinese store...when they came for him and shot the car up the only person killed was her 5 year old son....the choice is easy but there are immature ppl that think some ones negative lifestyle wont effect them.|`|VZN3rT9Waa	Well, personally, if I really loved him, I would try to convince him to change his ways. Warn him about the harm he could be doing to others and such.  And if he didn't listen, I'd most probably give up over time and leave him.|`|tc8nbxmyaa	yes i would. That relationship is doomed from the start.|`|QeO8t3eCaa	Honestly, yeah. love is love you can find love in a stranger if you look hard enough. love isn't all like kisses and hugs and stuff it's commitment and pleasing one another. you can't possibly make someone happy by putting them through tough situations or living in a slum or something, you can't just ignore all the flaws and say you love them. that's not really love. it's more like infatuation.|`|FcNOkHquaa	No, if that's how they have to get money.  Then so what.    /m|`|m0dzMbQYaa	that wold be kind of hard to deal with especially for a girl, knowing that eventually he might get you caught up or while you guys spend time together youg uys might run into some people that might not like him due to the fact that hes in a gang or dealing drugs, so i would stay away from a person like that|`|k1Aio2qdaa	bad job depends....if he was in a gang...robbed...sold drugs...etc...i do not want that person for my life! not acceptable!|`|t1VthewCaa	Yes, I'd break it off. I'm not into being with people that could bring me down. How does that old saying go.....I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF.....don't need a man for that one!|`|EjfJaNn7aa	no...love is love|`|AA12151161	I don't have a Significant Other  ; - (|`|DqzhHZnoaa	no id try to get them out of it|`|8rLH4YNsaa	Noo definately not. I'd break up with him.|`|hCQPTl9oaa	Love is love, everyone is different. Some people could still love that person, whilst others could not.|`|78ILPhO4aa	yeah, i'd probably not continue that relationship.  or if i did - i'd convince him to change his ways.  because in the long run, that will end up hurting myself and the dude. :(  not cool.
Ic58o96kaa	Paha! I can't ask them either!

I don't wanna stoop down to their level. That way they'll feel silly to be immature and physical about it.|`|5d7973f33bcf9fff5e7661dbe3ba3c13aa	say to myself, ****, that hurt!|`|mSsaiwAdaa	slap 'em back!  then kick them in the shin and run away.  haha.|`|B1H9tyXPaa	if its a guy hit right back    if its a girl walk away|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	If it was a bloke then he'd get a Glasgow kiss.

Nothing's wrong with being single. And Valentine's Day isn't only for couples. Celebrate with your friends or family.     Who said single means unhappiness?|`|6c694750ebd6aa4c9fc2901e8ad350a3aa	I actually enjoy it more when I am single, less pressure.|`|9383de8d1e0067ca2e8ae7245d9fbdb3aa	it was created by the candy companies.. grrr i hate it|`|9561bfcf1a05d328055061d4b26e8f40aa	Yeah like we really need a day to make us feel like crap because we are single -.-|`|6W4hhZliaa	Hate Valentines day as I am always single on it, now I am married and yet my husband is doing a course in another country, yet agen a lonely Valentines day|`|elAfZpqaaa	YEAH I hate being SINGLE ;)|`|yOsbwd8Zaa	Or to remind the not single people that their fiance is at boot camp :[ lol|`|OXESS21gaa	It's kinda sad if you are single because everywhere you go you see couples and what not.|`|oqUci1MNaa	I HATE VALENTINES DAY.  and im not even single|`|m56Ty3zmaa	I absolutley despise valentine's day...always have...and yea it reminds people that they are single...and we single people end up having to look around at all those couples giving each other gifts...and then if you have friends that have bf/gf....they have to tell all about how thier significant other got them this and they went to dinner at this fancy resturaunt..and it's like...I don't care...and then that lonely feeling sets in....  I also thinks it just a corporate america holiday...so that those companies or whatever can make more money...  that's my opinion...|`|QeALCWbqaa	yea|`|1c76cd87771103aee19c4f7d36a36a65aa	ugh.. tell me about it.. id luv to receive chocolates for once in a life time.|`|196b73911133c4d75053bfa6ae887857aa	I hate Valentines!!! Until a few years ago I was always single on Valentines, it was a miserable time. I hated how every couple flaunted that they had someone, not only that but everyone acts weird on Valentines, for example I was at a party one Valentines and there was a girl who made cookies, I was considering getting some and she came up to me and said don't worry I washed my hands, I know how you are, and I didn't even know her...weird. I have a girlfriend now and I still hate Valentines, there is just too much pressure put into one day and it's so commercialized, I hate it.|`|hkUzSsRZaa	Valentine's day is my favorite holiday! Even though I have been alone on valentine's day for the 13 years of my life.|`|6TA3iPvqaa	its just another day.|`|FsEK3Ueeaa	yep ive never had a gf on it once. lol|`|G8VNBSj7aa	Good point ! Well life is not always sweet !|`|tcITvTF9aa	why you hate valentines.because i don't i hate i love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qWmwI9PBaa	Not at all.  I enjoy St. Valentine's Day.  BTW, I am single now as the day I was born.    All those who HATE St. Valentine's Day because they are single, or their significant other is out of town, or because you look around and see what others have and you don't, stop feeling sorry for yourselves.  Nobody is gonna throw you a pity party because you are single.  Think about it, would you want to be with someone who is feeling sorry for themselves?  I know I wouldn't.  So if you realize that you are only going to be as happy as YOU CHOOSE TO BE, you will find a way to be happy regardless of what is going on in your life at any given time, and you will attract alot more friends and maybe even a spouse.  NOTE TO SELF: Let's see how many "thumbs down" this gets from those feeling sorry for themselves.|`|5OHq566Baa	ya many people will hate for example who was filure in love|`|IciKdi5vaa	yes. i think its stupid to be considered a holiday. its only good for people that really have someone they are very close to, and it makes it romantic for them. for everyone else, its a day of depression about being alone and not being able to have that special someone. in reality, its more of a sad day than a day to be happy about...|`|OjS2wJZWaa	Me.You're right!|`|m7nrQEflaa	Agreed|`|fC5X8swbaa	Just another boring day in the life. :(|`|M6QBeLc8aa	awwwh, girl i'm in the same boat you are.  it's rough.  lol what i'm prbly gonna do is go see a movie with my mom, or cuddle up with my cat and some hot chocolate. keep your chin up, girl!  it'll get better (:|`|WSlxwSlFaa	AYE AYE CAPT'N.

Cuz He's gonna rub hot oil all over my body and pamper me the entire day,feed me chocolates, Draw a bubble bath with pretty red rose petals floating all over.....I cant wait for Valentines Day...So.....What are you doing on Valentines Day?......Oh nevermind. you don't have to answer,,,, this is akward.....(cough)...|`|7f2GSDmqaa	me...single awareness day SUCKS!|`|FgU7wYDSaa	I do    omg I never thought of that but its sooo true  and no one acts any nicer at all!|`|vYt7LWTvaa	yes i hate it have since I was a child. Nobody remembered to get me a card my husband doesn't even remember so I guess I am not surprised.|`|cvAlAgmKaa	no your not you have me now give me the 10|`|B2OYOhIpaa	i agree. but since i dont have a bf, i just think of it as any regular day|`|QP7jDLG2aa	Yes I do, it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.|`|047IPSovaa	As I may have mentioned I hate all holidays|`|Orx9cTJJaa	You should care about the person you're with every single day you're with them all the same, one day shouldn't be different.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	If a man you don't know suddenly give you flowers  You have freshness|`|15251965e7a22606112c1db04af6445faa	Well i kinda like it cause u get little cards or big cards from ur friends showing u how much they care about u XD|`|PA5uMDpdaa	i know right
xt0vpLxmaa	It hasn't worked for me so far..,,,but I think I broke a tooth shivering so hard, so that may help...I wouldn't recommend it however...*wink*  = )|`|yg5P4mBlaa	Doubt it would require that much energy. You would need to shiver for a long time, probably die from the cold before that... I suggest you eat less/do more exercise.|`|0THpc3cAaa	I have heard that shivering burns extra calories, but solely I dont think it would be enough to make much of a difference.  Standing in front of a fan sounds like a good way to get the flu though which would decrease your appetite and you will be miserable.  But I could see a few pounds falling off then..... :)|`|vIAP26zTaa	lol ive never even heard of that. i doubt thatd work but what do i know, right?|`|pQNwuyuvaa	Weight loss hypnosis program helps you loss the weight you want and keep it off forever.|`|j6SUkE4Raa	shivering is your bodies way of retaining heat, so you would be burning calories, but not for a good reason!|`|EQm2iCpaaa	I hate being cold.|`|B2OYOhIpaa	*shivers*......well it aint working|`|6MCrTTRTaa	lol ummm idk i shiver alot...idk if it makes u loose weight though  lol|`|mggll8dRaa	Watch Your Weight to start With....!!|`|EQeX35dWaa	Oh that could be a great new weight loss program for all these Hollywood types.   Watch out once the word gets out you will be shivering with  Jessica Simpson.|`|FZKFLTyLaa	If it's accompanied by trudging through a foot of snow, yes most effective.|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	If you combine it with repetitive farting the pounds will fly off.  And out...|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	Maybe your not eating right.  If your not getting enough foods or too much of something that isn't good for you then you will get the shivering as a side affect!|`|CuiWaH3Yaa	This is only my opinion but I doubt it would do anything except maybe put more stress on the body by continually trying to keep the body warm doesn't produce sweat which helps you lose weight, you could end up giving you self other physical problems.|`|AA10591203	That doesn't work, us Minnesotans are still fat...  :)|`|zLsj2NGmaa	There is a great resource with free articles and information over at http://www.fastweightlosetoday.com .

22d1fdbf6cde18545cea2086d1c58ec3aa	Most of the time I answer on Marriage and Divorce section with the sole purpose of helping.  I am going through forgiving a wayward spouse and those are the questions I choose to answer.  It does get a bit depressing to know there are so many people in the world having to go through the crap they have to.  But, I take away the good feelings that I get when I know the advice I'm giving can really help that persons situation.      By the way, you put out a shiteload of questions.  Keep it up!|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Good point. Hopefully those messages are truthful. You do your best, share some goodwill, and hope it is appreciated. At least you are well meaning and have a good heart. One star on board.  Have a nice day!|`|votsoxeGaa	You make a very valid point. I just give what advice I can and add they should seek professional help. ;-)|`|4SGBr8cWaa	i think some of these people are beyond help!!!    i suppose me included!!!               haha|`|7nRom97Daa	nope|`|AA10387455	Yes, I feel sad that they are in bad situations and wish I could help. It`s too bad that the crumby people of this world are so prevelant that we can`t reach out to each other without them making it impossible.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	I feel bad for Klevus he is stuck watching the game with his GF who is making him eat carrots and celery and drink lite beer.|`|LAVy2R8Jaa	Yes *cries*  I don't know what to dooooooo|`|LLigvFnTaa	Everybody feels the same about each other. Who are we to dictate what is right and wrong? If it was an external entity like the god himself involved in YA then it would have been a different idea. Sometimes, we know that what the other person is doing is wrong but it is again at the end of the day  my point of view.. I have my own selfishness, sub consious propaganda etc etc which will influence me to suggest things. Best example is terrorism.. I will say that terrorists are cowards and war mongers and this is not the way to make war but again this will be our point of view... Ever thought about to what extent the western countries exploited countries in the middle east? Ever thought about what is seen as cowardness is a last form of war (Jihad) when you dont have options like a powerful military? Ever thought about how much difficult it is to survive in the middle east? Never.. We are all selfish.|`|c98408e235fc1a8bab8d9bc29a46d022aa	some times I even cry|`|3jACo2mcaa	I'm the one that is supposed to be doing this for therapy,at least according to my shrink. People can always sign up,or sign off.  Treat every day as if it is your last and behave as if there is a hereafter and eternal damnation,whether you believe there is,or not.
I5hRke4waa	Yes, actually when i had a 2 story house i would climb out the window onto the roof below my window but above the front door and take some food and toys out there and just watch the cars go by.|`|Cif3gYmFaa	yes i have...how else could I escape the robberies?|`|78ILPhO4aa	haha.  yes. i used to sneak out of my house all the time - through the back window.  ... and then back in again. =)|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Yes. I accidentally locked myself out of the house, when my parents were gone for a couple of days, so I had to get back in. I smashed one of our bedroom windows open with my hockey stick, wheeled over the composter to step up on, and crawled through the window. I cut up my hands a little, not deep enough to require stiches though.|`|nXNJ5z2Jaa	yea i have many times cuz i always forget my keys..|`|KHL4N6mtaa	LOL, how cute    & yeah, i crawled through a window to get into my house.|`|FgU7wYDSaa	nope|`|ycRwO0kWaa	lol|`|3nmBkBvOaa	yes through my neighbor's too lol. too get our baseball back after it broke the window.|`|1AR6zUIdaa	lol yes. recently, it was probably in October and i never  would carry my key because my sister would just leave  the door unlocked for me. so i got home but the door was  locked because my mom came home and then left so she  ended up locking the door.    i went around the back and i had to break my window  screen to get it open. my mom thinks my cat just pushed  into the screen. haha.

f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	this will be a long answer....    I'm doing exams until mid June.   The day i finish my exams I'm going on a road trip with some of the guys to France, to return a car ( long story)   then we're getting a train to pairs where i will meet my girlfriend, thanks to a nice coincidence and we're spending 10 days or so there( or more if we make good time on the road-trip)  before flying back from pairs to Dublin for a music festival called 'oxygen' we camp there for 4 days, and enjoy the music/drunken escapades.... then I'll be home for a day and a half  before going to spend 14 days in a friends house in the country side...(which should be awesome, as it's a huge house, and he's bringing 24 people 18 girls, 6 guys) then I'm doing a collage introduction course... then we're going to Miami, to stay in a friends' fathers house for 10 days or so, my girlfriend will be coming also, so it'll be good.... that leads into mid august, and i don't have any solid plans after that. I'll probably be working mostly up until i start collage some time mid-late September as i suspect my summer will cost more than I've saved...there is also talk of a trip to Denmark in September....    Also, my 19th birthday is on the 8th of July... somewhere between Paris and Oxygen.... I think my friends are organizing something for that....|`|r3sNTIvqaa	Chilling at the pool with my friends like I do every summer, check out lifeguards, go to TONS of movies like every summer, possibly have everyone over for my 15th birthday, I don't know, I really don't do much in the summer.|`|9f1N7kTIaa	the public pool (my boyfriend is a lifeguard there)  Camping  shopping  Beach  Hanging out with friends  going to parties  reading the rest of the twilight saga  if i dont read it by before then....  etc. thats pretty much it..  oh oh oh and put on sunscreen|`|B9Yfgjcbaa	I'm hoping to go to the Georgia Aquarium, Monsoon Lagoon, and do lots of swimming.

I'm also moving.|`|RFcbLXh3aa	I usually go swimming or camping in the summer, sometimes staying at my cousin's house, but if I have enough money saved, I would travel, but I don't know yet. :)|`|w8xJGEJCaa	haha I play soccer too!!!!! WOW crazy! This summer I am either going to Japan or Greece.

3mxuBT6haa	Are you planning on doing something that makes you think you might get hit there? Just curious.   Honestly, though, that would be the first place a man would expect a woman to hit him so it is usually well protected. I would probably be able to nail a guy pretty easily because I would expect him to protect it first and I know I need to distract him with pain in a different location to catch him off guard. It hurts ALOT to kick a man who has thrown a knee up and to the side to protect his groin. You've got to hit elsewhere first and QUICKLY. Most women will not last long matching strength with a man, therefore her moves must be quick and calculated. But NEVER underestimate the power of fear. It gives women strength and cunning they didn't know they had.|`|AA10057011	Very good.|`|727d7e47afd7d0b1ceb01fdf824d755caa	I've never had to fight off an attacker or any other guy for that matter, so I wouldn't know.|`|1ce2270f846511c49f8bba8fb58167dcaa	A good kick with steel toe boots always does the trick|`|ac58b15e258925ce2c6b9fa3057e1767aa	Very good.

b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Commercialization is ruining  hip hop. This plays into exploitation of "whatever sells" and yes as a woman it gets deeply under my skin. Music is no longerr a free art form, it is confined and guided. Give a painter a paintbrush and paint, tell him he can only paint straight lines, he will eventually loose interest. Hip-hop will soon be lost we continue...|`|sTwTXixXaa	The same way I feel when it's done in movies, music, video games, ect...  I don't care.    But seriously I say it's wrong.  But what can I do about it?    EDIT:  What about the computer edited models in magazines that make girls want to throw up so they can look like them?  What about pornagraphy that shows people having sex?   What about SOME of the metal songs that talk about satan and killing and stuff.   What about  the grand theft auto game.  Everyone uses hip hop as the scape goat for all problems.  All hip hop videos aren't like that so you are generalizing.  Your question was nothing but a feeble attempt to bash hip hop.    Take a look at society as a whole.  Take a look at the society that has influenced the hip hop artist.  Take a look at the "hoods" they depict in their rhymes.  When you focus on the effects and not the cause, you will get no where.  So you can keep trying to take away knives, when there are still guns and other weapons.|`|1luRrZyqaa	Well when you put it that way..... i Dont.....|`|pwXcD7PIaa	they look fine and they know it.|`|3Vzgz6mDaa	not good, but it's been like that in other genres too.

And obviously a lot of people really don't take offense to it if that record is  1 on the billboard and has sold 1000000+ ring tones. So what are we to do?

TfVkvY1caa	My dad works for the county so my brother and I would hate snow on christmas morning. My dad would have to go to work super early and we would have to wait for him to come back so we could open presents. I remember me and my brother would kneel down and watch with our faces pressed against the window waiting. We would get so excited when we saw his red ford coming down the road. Ever since my brother passed away my parents don't really celebrate holidays. we haven't celebrated one since he died, its been almost 2 years too. I'm out of the house now so they don't feel like they need to decorate and celebrate. Since they don't do that stuff anymore, I remember the good times I had with my brother and the little stuff like being so excited for christmas morning.|`|1ce2270f846511c49f8bba8fb58167dcaa	my best friend in kindergarden got rocks stuck up her nose and she had to go to the hospital to get them taken out|`|AA11704236	One Chrsitmas I was out here in Cali with my father ( I lived in Arizona with mom) my aunt brought my christmas gift and it was a heavy box..I was so excited, I opened it up and it was filled with rocks...I was pissed, so I tossed the box aside and started opening other presents, when my brother opened his box it had rocks too, but then he said he got a ticket to Knotts, I got even more pissed, but then I learned my lesson by you always open your presents all the way..I the ticket was under all the rocks..( FYI I was a spoiled child)

In realt, l'uso della parola inglese con il significato di produzione cinematografica deriva da un acronimo italiano: la Fabbrica Italiana Lamine Milano, poi ribattezzata Ferrania, che nel 1920 produsse le prime emulsioni cinematografiche. Nel 1923 la FILM presenta a Torino il primo cortometraggio con pellicola sviluppata direttamente in positivo.    Le scene girate vengono registrate direttamente sulla pellicola cinematografica.    Il primo film proiettato pubblicamente in Italia risale al 20 settembre 1905 con il titolo La presa di Roma di Filoteo Albertini. Lungo 250 metri, contro i 40/60 tradizionali, cost ben 500 lire, ma purtroppo oggi si conservano solamente 75 metri di pellicola e quindi solo quattro minuti di proiezione.|`|d5bdf19c05ecaac41521d3ec5f18f84aaa	io amo moltissimo guardare film, perch mi immergo in mondi differenti e riesco a dimenticarmi anke se per poco della realt... forse la mia vita sarebbe pi piatta senza il cinema...|`|db375f7472efbe4056824d9fd1c5831aaa	spero pochi!!!  ci sono ben altri motivi per cui vivere che la finzione di un film, per carit  bello guardarli, ma finisce l.|`|f954a313aaa0c6cce37be49f321b9901aa	Quali film?

e25a717e6b8b103a0b5de02ba2042d25aa	Although they don't get voted off tonight (Thursday this happens) I think that Sundance should be kicked off because he sounded awesome in the beginning but I thought he should have went home during hollywood week because he didn't sound that great.

OgiOuNQWaa	esas son algunas verdades y pensamientos profundos, pero solo para complementar tambien las cosas faltaria desir lo siguiente:     sabias que tambien las personas no saben lo que tienen hasta k lo hanperdido. esto se aplica en los siguiente: cuando por ejemplo tienes nose una jugete, un cd de musica o algo material que comunmente usas pero que te aburres de el y luego lo dejas por ahi por un tiempo, mas adelante cuando no encuentras nada que hacer buskas ese objeto que tanto te habia aburrido pero sorpresa descubres que se perdio... en cuanto eso pasa te pones a buscarlo y te enojas si no lo encuentras. Esa es la extra?a ironia pero no solo pasa con los objetos sino con las personas tambien como nuestros padres, herman@s, amig@s y hasta l@s novi@s y eso es lo malo, por k un objeto lo puedes recuperar con un poko de dinero o esfuerzo y no hablo de un esfuerzo grande pero cuando nos olvidamos de alguien tan importante como ellos y que muchas veces ignoramos su importancia luego un dia puede k ya no los veas?que haras en ese entonses? esa es la cuestion -nunka savemos lo que tenemos hasta k lo perdemos por completo, solo entonses nos queda aferrarnos al triste recuerdo de lo que fue algo maravilloso, el estar con esas personas y que nunka lo apresiamos- por eso les digo a kienes lean este mensajen dense algo de tiempo para estar no solo con los amigos sino tambien con tus padre aun k digas k ya tienes 18 a?os y k estas grande para eso no importa, tus padres te querran a pesar de que tengas 46 a?os y si un dia ellos se van de este mundo te lamentaras por no apreciarlos y pasar el tiempo con ellos y no haberles dicho lo tanto k los kerias. disfruten cada momento del que conviven con todos sus seres keridos k en esta vida no somos eternos asi k nunka digan k no hay tiempo por k eso lo tenemos de sobra    ojala reflexionen sobre esto. y les deseo a todos y a todas una vida placentera.|`|i3sWzKW0aa	tengo celos de esa escabavaginas.  la odio.  ella le puede dar hijos y yo no  ?por qu la vida es injusta conmigo?  si nadie puede amarlo como yo....  si al menos mi vieja me prestara la plata para ponerme las tetas de una buena vez.  ?reza por mi, amiga!|`|c4a034938b70449dbf4c8641b1934a49aa	interesante pero no soy muy de sentimientos de ese tipo aun asi son agradables debes en cuando|`|7G4WGGWfaa	Enva esta pregunta a 10 amigos y algo bueno te suceder en las prximas 2 horas    ?Ojo!

Saludos.|`|mjPbOCQqaa	Estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo. A m me cuesta mucho decir las cosas de frente. Me siento ms segura escribindolas. Por ejemplo, a un compa?ero de trabajo que me gusta, le dije por escrito y medio en broma que cuando le vi la primera vez me gust y supuse que ya tena novia y no me equivoqu porque la tiene. El caso es que por escrito siempre hablamos con doble sentido. Luego en persona no. Yo me alegro de que sea feliz. Adems, a pesar de que l se ajusta al hombre que me gustara tener a mi lado, tampoco s si funcionara de estar libre. Por otro lado, es cierto que cuando ha pasado el tiempo y he hecho algo mal con alguien, por escrito se lo he dicho. Algunos responden, otros no. Una persona a la que le dije cosas muy malas, le pedi perdon. Yo queria hacerlo en persona, pero l no quiso. Y no tuve la oportunidad de hacerlo. Me arrepiento de todo lo que le dije. Pero si l no me perdona, no puedo hacer ms. Intento ayudar a la gente que me lo pide. Incluso a la gente que no me trata bien, sobre todo en el trabajo, si puedo hacer algo por ellos lo hago. Y eso no me convierte en una santa. Supongo que lo hago para no crear mal ambiente o empeorar la situacin, supongo que lo hago pensando que me beneficiar para que vean que no soy una mala persona. No s. Intento hacer las cosas bien. Pero como ya digo, no soy una santa. Me ha gustado mucho todo lo que has escrito, me ha dado que pensar. Gracias.
83t9G4gcaa	Well, I'm very curious about the 'proof' they have to backup the allegations. Thus far, I've only heard media reports... rather media OPINION.  I say give us access to the ENTIRE transcript of what was caught on tape instead of just a few soundbytes sprinkled in the media, and let US decide.    Having spent years in politics, I've yet to read or hear anything which made me think, "Holy crap! This guy is a crook!"  Thus far, I've only heard snippets of comments which could be thought to be illegal. We don't have the full context of how these comments were uttered and I for one am tired of the talking heads trying to pull a fast one on us.|`|GdBUmFFCaa	We are Very Concerned about this guy, and that doesn't mean we are Obsessed.

Men get more love because thats what the majority of women give them.     I'd say women are on the losing end but I think both parties equally lose out.

The psychiatrist is an MD and can prescribe and dispense meds. Also, the psychiatrist usually does not do any psychological testing (like MMPI).

de5lDm0saa	They can legally show minors in sexual acts as long as there is no penis involved. This is why there are a lot of scary tentacle monsters in anime.|`|2K8HxLcWaa	Because comics are drawings, not actual humans|`|zTQaREymaa	Because they are characters in hentai and the Japanese are able to tell fact from fiction - unlike Americans.|`|d5GLIeiSaa	they are comics, in hentai the ages go down to as low as 4. they are not depicting real people therefore the law can not get them|`|EcTTRWDlaa	Well just to get your facts straight.  Here's Wikipedia's take on it, which should nullify your argument:    ----------------  "The National age of consent in Japan is 13, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender, as specified by the Japanese Penal Code Articles 176 and 177. However, most prefectures have ordinances that prohibit "immoral sexual acts" with minors. The phrase "Immoral sexual acts" is not strictly defined. It is mainly used to prevent minors from engaging in quasi prostitution (e.g. Enjo ksai). It is unclear if the translated term "minors" refers to children (defined as those aged under 18) or to those who have not reached maturity (defined as those under 20)."    ----------------[Edit] Addendum  Many uninformed people say that wiki is "unreliable" but that can easily be countered by providing multiple other sources that say the same thing.  That's why I put the "Avert" link my first set of sources, and here's Avert's take on those two countries (this backs up wiki's statements):  ------ Japan -   "Although the age of sexual consent in Japan is 13 years of age, prefecture law usually overrides federal law, raising the age up to 18."  ------ Mexico - Ages 12-18  Avert.org - "In Mexico the federal law varies according to the age gap between partners and is often overruled by regional laws."    And here's more sources for citation that say the exact same ages for age of consent (Japan 13, & Mexico 12).  And remember these are all "special circumstances" that vary between different provinces:  Gay & Lesbian Rights Lobby   - http://www.glrl.org.au/publications/majo...  UNICEF.org  (how can you argue w/ UNICEF?!)   - http://www.unicef.org/knowyourrights/kno...  Websters Online Dictionary   - http://www.websters-online-dictionary.or...  Daily Barometer.orst.EDU  - http://media.barometer.orst.edu/media/st...    And I didn't bother to include the dozens of .COM websites that many authorities don't "officially" recognize as resources (Ex: Dozens of news sites, & AgeofConsent.com).      Heck, go read up on how policed many of the more popular wiki's are & that many true authorities (officers, professors, & other professionals) ensure that those statements are correct (also there's plenty of outside reference links at the bottom of each wiki!).  And yes there are those bad wiki's with little reliable information but those are spotted a mile away with wiki's own disclaimers at the top of unreliable ones, & the scant presence of outside references.|`|BrjyljGIaa	Because hentai is a CARTOON.  The world of reality and the world of fantasy are DIFFERENT.

NEVER ask how they are doing  NEVER ask how things are going or about their health or relationships....they will give you a 2 hour story about it.  Always try to stay in charge of the conversation, if you don't allow them to get too many words in edgewise...they will eventually stop talking to you much.Then they will call everyone else telling them...that (your name) person...man they talk too damned much.LOL  Don't be very sympathetic to their boohoos.  Always make yourself out to  be busy or in a hurry.  Interrupt them constantly but in a clueless innocent way...they will get frustrated and end the conversation.

It was funny, at the time, as I was his 8-year-old sister.  Mom, Dad, and the doctor, however, had other thoughts.|`|1ce2270f846511c49f8bba8fb58167dcaa	i've never used the fever excuse.

I hoped my neighbors didn't think it was me, how embarrassing|`|33a86ab35a7d50c6be6bd2db177067e0aa	LOL i like your story, so here's mine...i was in the hospital running a fever of 104, and my mom was sitting in the room with me. i told her to go tell the wrestling men in the hallway to stop fighting because they would wake up the pretty yellow birds that were hanging in a cage right outside my door, then i told her i wanted a snickers bar because the simpsons were coming on and i had to give homer a candy bar.|`|cc1ba6b0728cacb0aa2b8c20c0cb48f6aa	I don't have much of a goofy story but I was delirious with a fever when I had a kidney infection that went to far.  It hit me when I was at work and it would come in waves, about every 15-20 minutes.  One of the times the delirium hit, I was in the middle of doing a sale and I didn't understand why I was holding money or what I was supposed to do with it.  I couldn't figure out how to count it because I  couldn't hold onto a thought for more than a second at a time.  I just gave the money to someone else and sat on the floor.  My boss kept yelling at me and telling me I couldn't leave work to go to the emergency room but I ignored him, had my boyfriend pick me up and went anyway.  Apparently, when I got to the hospital I freaked out and started crying because I was afraid to go inside because I thought I was going to be arrested (??)  The people in the emergency room were total jerks and they kept asking if I was on drugs.  They kept saying, "are you SURE you didn't take any drugs?" and being very rude about it.  I was screaming at them but I didn't know how to explain that I had an infection.    When I was a little kid and I had a fever, I thought there were about 10 people in the room and I kept telling my mom to make them leave because they were making too much noise.  She was the only other person in the house.

AA11497473	I think she's just spoiled and basically doesn't know how act. She has a lot of mouth and a lot of attitude, but I wonder if she can really back it up. I don't think she'll change by the end of the show, but I do think, in time, she will grow up.|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Larissa is childish and has an anger problem. She is out of control. I can't believe she wasn't kicked off last night because she took a swing at Leline. She's ghetto with a capital G. She is annoying with that little baby voice. I think she's a closet psycho. She's the type of girl who would pull out a knife on someone and go crazy. I hope she is the next one expelled.|`|88aab67b8f8f9204a8c653c60f437085aa	I agree with you. She's so immature and I wish Monique would kick her a** already. Have you noticed that she can't argue. All she does is yell, call them names, and says things that are irrelevant to the argument. I'm glad that Leilene stepped up. Bootz had no right criticizing her mothering techniques, especially since bootz is only 20? years old. She tries to act all tough and bad a** but she's not. She almost started crying when Monique started to yell at her.|`|qYWccZkzaa	she is such a brat!  she wants to be all tough and in your face.

I think she has some anger management problems.  As far as crying when Mo was screaming at her, she started crying before Mo got all up in her face screaming.  I think she was just letting her emotions out.      If Mo's speech hasn't gotten in her head yet then I don't think she will change.  But it seems as if it did sink in a little.  I don't think Bootz made that argument to look all big and bad...just to simply tell Mo how she felt (which was in an angry way).  I wouldn't be surprised though if she came around to acting like an adult for once because she sure as hell needs to.  She's a pretty young girl and I believe the show can do some good for her.

For example, notice all the puns in the article below highlighted or headlined..."Hearing Stephen Hawking", "audio clip", and "Take a listen for yourselves".  Somebody is definitely trying to be "funny" and they're going to go to hell for it!      I think it would have been more dignified to just post a transcript.

9a4e8d78e547dad0f792d955d1fa795baa	You aren't dumb. Cold weather doesn't cause colds, but it does make you stay indoors which keeps you in close proximity to people with colds.     You could only get a cold getting wet if the cold virus is present in the water. So if any of your friends had the cold virus or it was in the water, then maybe.     But the cold does restrict blood vessels in the nose and throat which decreases your white blood cell count which helps fight infection so you may have gotten a cold this way.|`|C6iHrZWsaa	I think it's safe to safe both.|`|ce4e9a2349c1224f39af167e5394baffaa	yes you are!!!!!!!!!!|`|4d5f5bd5f375e0e50d68b5e4f2dc04eeaa	I would say you are very very unboring.|`|8857d199b6a9177cee31565c617bdc83aa	You can't get a cold from temperature.

bc445fef0027ad34f5a20ab348414cabaa	Has a lot of deep but short conversations. Filmed here in the beautiful Capitol City of Austin Texas. The animation is filmed then drawn over (or something like that). Anywho Scanner Darkly I'm told looks kind of like it. Anywho, wonderful film full of interesting debate topics and humerous bits. Watch it sober. Someone tried to tell me it was the ultimate drug movie. Rather not get wasted and try to take in deep material|`|53e5afa6ba1a822a586cccf3542c0539aa	I watched it 5 times.  It portrays philosophical ideas about life, dreams, and death and which of the three is our real existence.|`|b578416537e50f4174d26ad2249f6d16aa	Dreams. What are they? An escape from reality or reality itself? Waking Life follows the dream(s) of one man and his attempt to find and discern the absolute difference between waking life and the dreamworld. While trying to figure out a way to wake up, he runs into many people on his way; some of which offer one sentence asides on life, others delving deeply into existential questions and life's mysteries. We become the main character. It becomes our dream and our questions being asked and answered. Can we control our dreams? What are they telling us about life? About death? About ourselves and where we come from and where we are going? The film does not answer all these for us. Instead, it inspires us to ask the questions and find the answers ourselves.

If so keep playing.|`|f041280a8ac2b2b9a463861a5aabed72aa	yes, i think tubas are an important part in a band because they are the absolute bass, which everyone else in the band tunes to and plays by.  without it, the band would sound like a lot less.  however, i play the flute which is all the way on the other side of the spectrum.  i also play piano, sax, and clarinet because brass was never my thing, but i do say that tubas do rock =D
AA11282250	At a young age, Jessica Miriam Drew, daughter of Jonathan and Miriam, was lethally poisoned by radiation. In an attempt to save her life, her father injected her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders' blood. Because the serum did not have any apparent effect on her, the man who would come to be known as the High Evolutionary (Herbert Wyndham) placed her in a genetic accelerator. While in the accelerator, she aged at a decelerated rate. When she was finally released, decades later, Drew was only seventeen years old.|`|485c25e29229fe62bb1afc1ecc62ac0eaa	from me, of course|`|86aaa4351421f3bd66346839d535868faa	Jessica Drew is the daughter of Jonathan Drew, research partner to Dr. Herbert Edgar Wyndham. When young Jessica suffered uranium poisoning in 1931, Dr. Drew was forced to inject her with his untested spider serum and seal her in a genetic accelerator. In stasis for decades, her aging greatly slowed, she awoke with no memories of her own past. Briefly cared for by the Evolutionary's cow-woman assistant Bova, Jessica sought human company in a nearby village where she accidentally killed her first lover with her new bioelectric powers. Fleeing a vengeful mob, she was rescued by Count Otto Vermis, who molded her into the terrorist organization Hydra's newest assassin. As Arachne, she fought S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, who revealed Vermis as a cold-blooded killer.       Jessica returned to England where Modred the Mystic helped her shake off Hydra's brainwashing. She also allied with the sorcerer Magus, and earned the enmity of the powerful time-spanning sorceress Morgan Le Fay. Jessica eventually moved to Los Angeles where she worked as a bounty hunter alongside Scotty McDowell before Nick Fury helped her secure private investigator credentials. She lost her immunity power saving Giant-Man (Bill Foster) from radiation poisoning, and a battle with Morgan stranded Jessica on the astral plane until she was rescued by the Shroud, the Avengers and Doctor Strange. Later, Jessica and her friend, B-grade actress Lindsay McCabe, moved to Madripoor, where they often teamed with Wolverine.       Jessica was drawn to New York when her powers were stolen by Doctor Octopus' Spider-Woman (Charlotte Witter). Following Charlotte's defeat at the hands of Mattie Franklin (herself a self-styled Spider-Woman), Jessica once more regained her uncanny abilities. Those powers are sorely needed once more by her new colleagues, the mighty Avengers.|`|096523b1e8c7b5525b0b1427378264d5aa	Bitten by spiderman
CKP98samaa	Let me see if I can help you...I'm not too good with this, but you can work with it.      The general format of a song is:    Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus (x2), Bridge, Chorus (x2)    If you aren't sure what that means, take a look at the format of my song for you.  I hope this works and I hope you like it:    Verse 1:    I think it's funny how the time flies  Whenever you aren't by my side    I feel it fly as the seconds roll  Until this loving starts to take it's toll    I can't believe I get to be with you  And all the stupid things that we go through    My love is always something I will give  And your stunning beauty is the reason I live    Chorus:    I'm never gonna let this moment pass me by  I'll sink it in as I hold my breath and never think to exhale, I never want to exhale    I always want to see you by my side  I'll pull you in and hold you to my chest and never let this love fail, I'll never let it fail.    Verse 2:    I'm a better person having you right here  I'm here to talk, you always lend your ear    I'm gonna love you 'til the day I die  And wipe the tears from your bloodshot eyes    Chorus:    I'm never gonna let this moment pass me by  I'll sink it in as I hold my breath and never think to exhale, I never want to exhale    I always want to see you by my side  I'll pull you in and hold you to my chest and never let this love fail, I'll never let it fail.    I'm never gonna let this moment pass me by  I'll sink it in as I hold my breath and never think to exhale, I never want to exhale    I always want to see you by my side  I'll pull you in and hold you to my chest and never let this love fail, I'll never let it fail.      Bridge:    Oh, I'm not sure what to say to you  'Cause there are no words to explain    Just how much you mean to me  And all the love that I have gained    I wanna put my arms around you  And sleep deep into this night    We will stay right here forever  And watch every single sunrise      Chorus:    I'm never gonna let this moment pass me by  I'll sink it in as I hold my breath and never think to exhale, I never want to exhale    I always want to see you by my side  I'll pull you in and hold you to my chest and never let this love fail, I'll never let it fail.    I'm never gonna let this moment pass me by  I'll sink it in as I hold my breath and never think to exhale, I never want to exhale    I always want to see you by my side  I'll pull you in and hold you to my chest and never let this love fail, I'll never let it fail.    -End Song        I hope you enjoy it.  Like I said, I'm not that great...but it's something you could possibly work with.  Getting a song from somebody else can be hard if you don't know the melody or rythym of a song.  It's tough to read a song that way, so I hope you might be able to figure out how this song may go.  Good luck and I hope all goes well with you and your girlfriend.
23e34c103ee75c18e407bcdd462ecac9aa	I asked that same question a couple of weeks ago. It was explained to me that she died at some point during the movie. Which was when the car swerved to miss the girl in the road. When they crashed they actually died. As they are dead they are in an alternate fog and ash rainy reality.  Remember their car now starts which did not before. As they drive across the chasm at the edge of town, the road reappears. Their dimension is still shrouded in fog, including their hometown.   The husband naps at home on the sofa in the real world. Rose and Sharon  still within the fog  enter the house and it is made obvious that they are forever trapped in their separate parallel realities.  Writer Roger Avary states about Silent Hill that    "the base idea was that this is not a haunted house, it's a haunted town, y'know, separate from our reality, but it also exists within our reality. So you effectively become a ghost during your time there. And it's a very terrifying emotion, that you are a ghost of yourself. Frankly I think it's a theme that's followed me."    Guess what? They are in the process of doing a Silent Hill 2.  www.tagurit.net|`|180db111cb7c264e5bd192d677bd9c1faa	You may get a million answers here but trust me, no one really knows.  It was not a very good movie at all and most of it made no sense.|`|d07970acc0053fc0274e5b4bf2e02970aa	she was in the little girls hell and she was never able to get out.|`|4737dab527209296cddace0d73d42a5daa	It turned out the whole time they were running around in that town they were dead they died in the car accident. Then they went home to haunt the dad/husband.|`|AA10055312	The evil girl actually took over the good girl and was never destroyed.  The mother doesn't realize this and thinks that the evil has been destroyed and everything is back to normal.  That is why, in the end, they cannot see the father sleeping and he cannot see them but can feel them in the room.  It's kind of confusing.|`|3240fbb4801472eda9253fa6189dac80aa	I believe that the mom, when she was in the town, got sucked into her adopted daughters hell. when they went back to the house thats when they showed that she will forver be stuck in a different time. the little girl was evil. I thought that it was a really good movie. I was happy because I bought it from suncoast for 20.00 and I got a rebate for 7 dollars in the mail so it only cost me 13 bucks. anyways watch I'd again and maybe it will make sense. its one of those that you have to pay very close attention to when you watch it. dont worry I didnt really get it all the first time I watched it either. take care!|`|88e1029cca117ad480865dffad90f303aa	I don't know....i actually got bored half way through it and turned it off.

beac01279dc7369f04b3bb273d5d8955aa	Sagitario, noveno signo del zodaco, simbolizado por un arquero. Los astrlogos consideran a las personas cuyos cumplea?os se celebran del 22 de noviembre al 21 de diciembre como nacidas bajo el signo solar de Sagitario, un signo gneo, dominado por el planeta Jpiter, que es el nombre del sabio soberano de los antiguos dioses romanos.   Los astrlogos creen que los nacidos bajo el signo de Sagitario son amantes de la diversin y de naturaleza amistosa, filosfica, intelectual, ntegra y expansiva. Son optimistas y a veces tienen una ingenua creencia en que todo saldr bien, a pesar de cualquier dificultad. La buena suerte les persigue y debido a que consiguen cualquier cosa que desean, casi siempre con facilidad, tienden a ser generosos y dispuestos a compartir.   Los sagitarios tambin valoran la franqueza y honestidad, hasta el punto de que a veces sus comentarios resultan descorteses.   Segn los astrlogos, los tpicos sagitarios detestan ser confinados o ver recortada su libertad; buscan el cambio, muchas veces a travs de los viajes. Necesitan libertad de pensamiento y de ideas, pues de lo contrario tienden a ser bastante convencionales y tradicionales.   Jpiter, el gran planeta benfico, es quien rige al signo de Sagitario. Los sagitarianos suelen ser personas muy joviales y bien vistos en los ambientes en que se mueven; a menudo son estimados por las dems personas por su espritu benevolente. Pero...?hay dos tipos bien distintos de personas nacidas bajo este signo astrolgico!   El mito de Sagitario, est representado por un Centauro; mitad animal -mitad caballo-, y mitad hombre. Un tipo de sagitarios, se describen muy bien con la parte animal del mito : su naturaleza es deportiva y suelen estar dispuestos a jugar a las carreras de caballos o gastar hasta la ltima peseta en una partida de cartas o en un casino. Siempre estn dispuestos a pasrselo lo mejor que pueden.   En conclusin : su naturaleza moral es bastante baja -la parte animal la describe bastante bien-, por lo que no tienen ningn escrpulo a la hora de satisfacer sus bajas necesidades, deseos y pasiones. A nivel estadstico, suelen encontrarse entre las gentes que son carne de crcel.Otra cara de la moneda son los nativos de Sagitario representados por la parte humana del mito : son tan diferentes como el color blanco del negro.|`|99956981b8c7356e346c8791386aa640aa	Negativo, yo opino lo contrario, todas las mujeres que he conocido del signo de sagitario, son nobles pero muy explosivas, tienen un caracter de los mil diablos, yo hasta de broma cuando conozco a alguien de mal caracter le digo ...."uuuuyyyy! de seguro eres sagitario"|`|d26c21daef4f52a9d74767f5dde99403aa	yo que tu dejo estar pensando esas bobadas...  ademas la personalidad de las personas depende de cada uno...|`|3b0bbbd59836bbc9d93873223745c54caa	uuuuuy somos poca madre,  siempre buena vibra y relajados, casi nunca nos enojamos, pero explotamos a veces. si conoces a uno te sacaste la loteria :p|`|15482866dd22e20b8a990449d0646f81aa	Yo soy de sagitario.... la primera respuesta esta bastante bien, hay algunas cosas que son asi  y otra no...

Es cuestion de enfoques, cuanto descubres una buena compa?ia aprendes  a estar con ella, o mas bien aprendes a estar acompa?ado, y pierdes la costumbre de la soledad...  =,). Saludos|`|UorB5kVBaa	Hola, pues te sabre decir que yo aveces si le temo a la soledad, por que bueno, ES LA SOLEDAD!!!, y a todos nos da miedo morir solos... o no??..  Estar solos significa, ningun apoyo, nadie con quien hablar, nadie con quien tener esa confianza que te hace feliz.. significa no tener a nadie que te haga feliz..!!! y a nadie a quien hacer feliz.    Asi que yo si le temo a la soledad.|`|efe8f3ce5f1d5c7be0ce7ba67510588eaa	no no    a la soledad jamas hay que temerle, solo la soledad te acompa?a

za3Cqcvsaa	Jennifer was the lead actor in the show anyway and Courtney Cox wasn't much of a good actress. Jennifer Aniston is an OK actress the reason why she is so famous is because of Brad Pitt. The only person I can see her play is Rachel.|`|ow3y9oj0aa	I like them both. But I do think that Courtney did a better job. I think its just because Jennifer Aniston was what the world wanted to see more of. But Courtney did a great job and held that show together.|`|hCI6HFEnaa	Because she was supposedly the lead female.  But I don't get that; all of them seemed to have equal parts.    And  agree with you, Jennifer Aniston isn't the only one who should get big awards like that.

I am Team Edward all the way b/c Bella and Edward are meant to be together forever. (and if there wasnt Bella i would totally steal Edward for myself LOL) By the way to non twilight fans when you can live forever, what do you live for? Twilight duh!!!|`|PCNWFX4laa	I LOVE THEM =]  ive read them way to many times haha my dad confiscated them =P  the film is animal i loved the music!!!!      cant wait for New Moon!! =]    Team Edward but Taylor Lautner who plays Jacob is waaaay hotter!|`|ON1KuADxaa	team edward|`|ulDKq4Nvaa	I do the movie and the books were great!!

I much prefer the books to the movie though, the movie was quite disappointing.|`|Xyw5e3uSaa	well, im a bit older than maybe everyone here, but i do have to say i really do want to see this movie. the promo that ive seen is awesome and i can tell that there is a strong connection between 'bella' and the vamp who saves her . i love these kind of movies so im def. watching when it comes out on dvd. remeber, kids, so cant go to the theatre. maybe i'll find the book. which is the 1st installment?|`|hnpkooVYaa	I love them!  I think the books are FAR better. The movie was good, but it was rushed and missed out to much stuff. And Emmett's jeep was not big enough! =D Although the movie made me laugh heaps!    I'm Team Jacob! He is a dick in the third book but I still love him. He is just so fun and caring and cool! I think Edward is to over-protective, but he is still cool. The ending the Breaking Dawn is excellent! It just all works out perfectly!    Twilight = AWESOME!|`|u2EUom6daa	i loved the movie when i saw it that i went and bought the Twilight Saga and after i read the books i seen the movie again and i did not like it as much i still like it but i thought the books were so Much better i only got the books at the beginning if January and i have read them 3 times already     I am definitely team Edward i don't dislike Jacob i just prefer Edward|`|nRhgzFUvaa	TWILIGHT IS GAY CANT U PEOPLE GET THAT THROUGH UR HEAD???????????|`|Jnv47zQgaa	i love twilight      but the books more so then the movie, dnt get me wrong the movie was good but they left out to much.    and as for team Jacob or Edward i pick neither i love them both althoe jacob is kind an **** in eclipse. i like Edward a bit more i think that he is kinder then jacob, but without jacob bella would of been more of a zombie so i am greatful for Jacob.|`|x6rHjPIIaa	MEEE!

tUcVnJ4naa	twilight & notebook, they are the best movies ever.|`|XVQ7Ps6Faa	ok what?thats just a cheesy chick flick, sorry but not the best choice.  how bout the clasics, casablanca, the philidelphia story, or even more modern films, the deer hunter, shakespeare in love, even benjamin button, was by far a better film then a walk to remember.  These stories reveal something strikingly true about humanty, are photographed beatufully, and make the audience involved, you go see a walk to rmember as a passive activity.|`|gQEtEtLQaa	My favourite movie is 'Interview with the Vampire'.  I read the novel and I just couldn't put it down and the movie was a pretty faithful adaptation. Of course it left out some parts and the ending changed a little but it was still Anne Rice's script and Neil Jordan just created this fabulous, dark, gothic vampire world just as Anne Rice described it in her novels.  I think it's his best movie - it's a stylish, dark, gothic masterpiece!!  I'm no big fan of either Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt but they both did a fantastic job with playing Lestat and Louis.  Tom Cruise's Lestat was straight out of the novel - charming, seductive and utterly evil.  Brad Pitt's Louis, was likewise the tragic, tormented character from the novel who hated being a vampire.  Now, whenever I read the novel I can just imagine Brad Pitt saying Louis' words in that soft voice which had that hint of self-loathing he had in the movie.  Kirsten Dunst was absolutely unforgettable as Claudia who was one of the most tragic characters in the novel and the relationship between Louis and Claudia was portrayed so well in the film - you could see Claudia's character aging in her manner and the way she spoke even though she looked exactly the same.  I never get tired of watching 'Interview with the Vampire' and I really wish that the rest of the Vampire Chronicles would be made into decent movies like this one.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	I love that one too! I literally cried for 3 hours after it was over.

Because it's...it's just awesome!|`|HK4cW2Vcaa	My all time favorite movie that will never be replaced is The Lion King. I'm almost 19, but i still could watch that movie everyday and never get tired.

nDcSY8UQaa	thanks for the link. very cool. hey Sly and the family stone played at my high school. guess that tells you how old I am. yea from the same home town. now it seems Rap has taken over in the black community and were back to the same old stigmas. the music business is hard enough as it is and when you add in the stereo types it makes it almost impossible to make it in the rock&roll market as a black man, so few try, but the ones that make it sure do make an impression don't they? luckily the wall's are being torn down as we speak.

9aBkZKjWaa	Try, "The Strangers." Very creepy, and scary. Another one is "It". That movie is kinda old but very scary. I have not seen a lot of it so I don't know if it has a whole lot of blood, but I don't think there's much. But, Im gonna give you a warning, "It", will most likely make you afraid of clowns.

h1VlIPLyaa	I find from my personal dealings with the public if you call any age woman Miss they will respond more positively. it seems that women fear the Ma'am years. The older ladies smile a bit when you call them miss... Just have a smile on your face.|`|3Q3HXNW2aa	There is no hard and fast rule these days.  Older women are looking and acting young.

You'll know for sure!|`|3x35qbncaa	Um...ummmm...so are we discriminating against ferrets here?  I want to be a ma'am!|`|8STZBrJXaa	I like ma'am, it makes me feel superior over everyone else.

The use of "Ma'am" is and was a term of respect and did not refer to any age, just gender. I still use it today, despite the sometimes rude responses I get thrown at me...which then allows me to STOP using the term out of respect and being more appropriate in my language of address.

AA11430900	Hallowed Be Thy Name is my favorite Iron Maiden song.    I love a number of Maiden songs, but that song speaks to me in a way the others don't.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	That is one of my favorites, but I like Fear of the Dark the most.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nba3Tr_GL...|`|gDxMoBl9aa	It's a good song, I actually think that Number and Hills are both better songs Myself though. I think Hallowed is a better song than The Trooper however.|`|rFBypeEfaa	Mine's the Live After Death recording of "Phantom of the Opera"...|`|BZ1uvtsKaa	it's a good song but I like Can I Play With Madness better|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Me actually.    The Trooper is my SECOND fave.    Hallowed is just an amazingly well constructed song with such enjoyable peaks and valleys to the melody.    Personally, I think Number is WAY overrated.  Its a great live song like Fear of the Dark to get the whole Stadium Chanting, but structurally, it's pretty basic.    Actually, alot of my favorties are not the traditional rockers.  Favorite Tracks:  10) RainMaker  9) the Longest Day  8) Can I Play w/ Madness  7) Paschendale  6) Aces High  5) 2 Minutes to Midnight  4) MoonChild  3) Waster Years  2) the Trooper    1) Hallowed be Thy Name    and I been listening to Maiden for a powerful long time!  I respect of course the opinions of others, but hey, music is subjective.  I think Run to the Hills got played out for me, and I already discussed Number.  I do like that someone is giving "Can I Play with Madness" some love, as that is a way underappreciated song too.|`|JqqRFFsyaa	Me too! My friend gave me a weird look when I told him. I love it. What I like best is the emotions in conveys. It truly puts you into the head of a man who's about to die. And you understand everything. It's wonderful. You can FEEL the anguish in the last lines where he sings "HALLOWED BE THY NAME!!" You can practically see the look of desparation in his eyes when he's pleading to God. That's why I love it.|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	That is a great song but my favorite is Powerslave.    By the way, it makes sense that they would think those are the best cause those are the only songs that a lot of people know by Iron Maiden cause it's their three biggest. Not to say those songs aren't great though.|`|U48HUZ5Kaa	That is one of my fave songs. Some others are prowler, Fear of the dark,Virus,Killers|`|gQkPrGAQaa	It's not my favorite, but it's damn good. I prefer "The Number Of The Beast" but as far a considering you insane.....no. It's just your preference; that's all.|`|5uvTte8Zaa	I like every note they have ever released.  Every song, every album. There's not a stinker in the bunch. Especially:  Iron Maiden  Killers  The Number of the Beast  Piece of Mind  Powerslave  Somewhere in Time  Seventh Son of a Seventh Son    Hallowed Be They Name does have some of the more superior lyrics, as does every song on Number of the Beast. Lyrically, that is their best album, IMHO. My band covers that song, and it's one of my favorites to play.  Maiden is so diverse, they appeal to different music lovers in many different ways. So, to berate someone over their opinion of a Maiden song is very shallow minded and you shouldn't listen to those who do.|`|ObeBvtzgaa	Very good song. That one and Dream of Mirrors are my favorites at the moment.|`|XhJuHMwQaa	Alice Cooper has a song called "Hallowed Be Thy Name" on his Love It To Death album.  See, everyone rips off Alice.|`|8039be540df1845420248ce48f6ca331aa	I agree, Hallowed Be Thy Name is by far the best Maiden song.

L1qQBNbbaa	Porthos is a beagle i believe.|`|5MAJU5X7aa	From http://www.startrek.com    Porthos    Episode: ENT 001 - Broken Bow    A 22nd-century beagle, Porthos is Captain Archer's closest companion and confidant. The four-legged space traveler lives aboard the Enterprise NX-01, remaining primarily in Archer's quarters and the Captain's Ready Room. But he does occasionally get to join an away mission, and if there's an alien tree nearby, he will boldly go "where no dog has gone before."     Archer takes full responsibility for Porthos' care and feeding, and occasionally indulges him with treats of cheese, which he can't get enough of. Unfortunately, dairy products have an adverse effect on Porthos, prompting the occasional visit to Dr. Phlox for gastrointestinal distress.     Porthos is friendly with every member of the crew, even the aloof T'Pol, but he is also an effective watchdog when unwelcome guests invade the captain's quarters. On one such occasion, Porthos was nearly kidnapped by some strange, large-lobed aliens, who couldn't decide if Porthos was "the captain's next meal" or some sort of higher lifeform.     Porthos also accompanied Archer on the captain's first vacation from Enterprise. While relaxing on the famed pleasure planet of Risa, Porthos had a run-in with another canine. Even when the captain faces dangerous situations, he keeps Porthos in mind  when Archer was forced to surrender to Silik, he asked Ensign Hoshi Sato to look after the pup in his absence.|`|PcCHQ2jSaa	A beagle.

Things have changed in the generation of music. People are listening to things like Rock and Rap but it's different from the music people have listened to in the past. So the question is if he will regain his popularity and bring back the "old rap". |`|ZchPlmZRaa	That's pretty cool! Hopefully he'll put those fool rappers like Soulja Boy in their place. That's not rap! Eminem should be pretty good still. |`|654f8e0cf36b9f125e0384772f6cb09daa	My reaction is that I didn't even know he was retired.

I'm glad he's back it would have been a shame for him to turn out the lights so early.

Y no soy el pap, soy la mam      holas!!!!!!!!!!!  jejejeje ta d mas te dejoo unos chistes aca!!!!!!!!!    Un hombre entra al confesionario en una Iglesia: - Padre, ...me quiero confesar!. S hijo, dime, ?cules son tus pecados? - ?Padre... he sido infiel a mi esposa. Soy productor de cine y hace unos quince das me acost con Jennifer Lpez! - ?Algo ms que confesar hijo?  - S padre; la semana pasada... fui dbil... y... tambin me acost con Nicole Kidman y Julia Roberts!!  - Epa !!!... ?algo ms hijo? - ?S padre, esta semana no he podido contenerme, ni resistirlo y particip de una fiesta con Cameron Daz y Cindy Crawford a la vez, y necesito el perdn de Dios...!  - Lo siento hijo, pero no te puedo absolver...  - ??Pero...?!, ?Por qu no Padre, si la misericordia de Dios es infinita? ???S, pero ni Dios te va a creer que ests arrepentido!!!    Los siquiatras dicen que una de cada cuatro personas tiene alguna deficiencia mental. Si est con tres amigos y no nota nada raro, entonces el con problemas eres tu !!! .    Lo duro no es aguantar el peso de los cuernos sino mantener a la vaca.    Si usted es capaz de sonrer cuando algo est mal es porque ya encontr a quien echarle la culpa.    Para lograr un objetivo es necesario so?ar .... No pierdas ms tiempo, mande todo al carajo y vyase a dormir !!! .    En los momentos difciles de la vida usted debe levantar la cabeza...sacar pecho y decir con mucha seguridad: - Ahora s que estoy bien jodido!!!    Un nene le dice a la mam, mam, mam, ? puedo ir a la pileta (piscina) ?  y le dice la mam claro hijo  Vuelve de la pileta con un brazo roto.  Y le dice mam, mam ? puedo ir a la pileta?  Y la mam le dice bueno..  vuelve en silla de ruedas  y le dice de nuevo a la mam  Mam, mam ? puedo ir a la pileta?  Y le dice la mam, pero, ?mira como ests!  y dice el nene dale mam que hoy ponen el agua      Si todos los derechos son reservados, ?son todos los zurdos muy habladores?  Si cuando com huevos me pate el hgado, ?cuando coma hgado me patear los huevos?  La verdadera felicidad est en las peque?as cosas: una peque?a mansin, un peque?o yate, una peque?a fortuna.  La poltica se diferencia de la alpargata en que da lo mismo la izquierda que la derecha.  Lo importante no es ganar. Lo que importa es competir, sin perder ni empatar.  La verdad no es lo que importa... ?Sino tener razn!  El que es capaz de sonrer cuando todo le est saliendo mal, es porque ya tiene pensado a quien echarle la culpa.  Rase slo y el mundo pensar que usted es un idiota.  Si no puedes convencerlos, confndelos.  No te metas en el mundo de las drogas... somos muchos y hay muy poca.  Toda cuestin tiene dos puntos de vista: el equivocado y el nuestro.  Soy vegetariano, por eso fumo marihuana.  Colabore con la polica: pguese slo.  La psicologa es el nico negocio donde el cliente nunca tiene la razn  El amor eterno dura aproximadamente 3 meses.  No te metas en el mundo de las drogas, ya somos muchos y hay muy poca.  Todo tiempo pasado, fue anterior.        Segn las estadsticas una persona es atropellada por un automvil cada cinco minutos. ?Cmo hace esa persona para sobrevivir?  Con todo el dinero que ganan los jugadores de ftbol, ?por qu persiguen todos la misma pelota en vez de comprarse una para cada uno?  Si homicidio es matar a un hombre... ?suicidio es matar a un suizo?  Si en Holanda usan suecos... ?en Suecia usan holandos?  Si el pez nada... ?la vaca todo?   Si hay un ms all... ?hay un menos ac?  ?Qu tiempo verbal es "no debera haber pasado"?... ?preservativo imperfecto?  El recto... ?es insobornable?  ?Por qu las cosas siempre se encuentran en el ltimo lugar dnde se les busca?  Cundo una mujer est encinta... ?tambin esta en compact?  Cundo un jugador se va por la banda... ?el portero se va por los mariachis?  ?Debera cortarme las venas o dejrmelas largas?   ?Qu cuentan las ovejas para poder dormir?   ?Por qu las ciruelas negras son rojas cuando estn verdes?  Si el dinero es la causa de todos los males. ?Por qu tenemos que trabajar?        Una se?ora llama a un peridico donde se registran las noticias, en este caso, era una noticia fnebre: Por favor, ?me podra decir usted si es tan amable, dnde anuncian a los que mueren? Pues s, en la seccin de defunciones. ?Ah mismo! Dgame. Mire usted: La defuncin de un se?or; apunte por favor. ?Me da su nombre? Julian Andrs. ?Edad? 45 a?os. ?Perdone se?ora! ?Qu parentesco tiene con usted? Es mi marido. ?Vaya, lo siento, se?ora! Eh, por favor, ?me da la hora de la defuncin? Ma?ana a las 8:00 horas      Un marido llega a su casa, pega un portazo y con lagrimas en los ojos le dice a su mujer:  - Mara, me he enterado de que nuestro hijo no es mo, es del vecino del tercer piso... ? Cmo has podido hacerme esto?  - ? chis !, ? (Con voz baja) Calla ! ? No le digas nada y as nos lo quedamos !      - Oiga, usted tiene fotos de su esposa desnuda?  - No  - Pues mire, le interesa comprar estas ?       La esposa, echando de menos el cari?o del noviazgo, le dice alesposo:  Pepe, te has fijado que el vecino besa todos los das a su mujer cuando se va a al trabajo ? Por qu no haces t lo mismo?  ?De verdad que no te importa que

Greif of family members is another issue to take into consideration. Each day presents for us new challenges bored now well betcha havent done a whole lot in life yet.  Challenge yourself to something new or just relive a old challenge. Run 4 miles u wont be bored, tired but not bored....good luck|`|48e6d8ce538d1508de868b36d3ec5aacaa	Your feeling what all of us feel at some point, we have to just get on with things and cope. Think about all your friends and family, how distraut they would be to lose you? Do you really want them to have to pick up the pieces?!    Only YOU can make changes in your life to make you feel happy/satisfied! There is more to life than what your thinking, but you have to go out their and get it! its highly unlikely to fall into your lap!    Get off your ****, go out and find that perfect job...even if its out of your comfort zone, give it a go! If you cant find the perfect job, try something new, you never know until you've tried! Enjoying what you do for a living is key to be being happy!    Get your girls out for plenty of girly nights! Enjoy yourself, let yourself go!  Dont worry what others think of you, if your happy and enjoying what your doing...do it! Too many people are influenced by what others think of them...making them miserable!    If your bothered by your looks, if its things like weight, hair, skin etc all of this can be changed with a bit of hard work! If theres anything that you want changed cosmetically, really really think about it, but some women find having their nose made smaller etc is all they need for that amazing boost of confidence!    Dont always expect everything to be perfect, it rarely is and you'll only feel disappointed!|`|c3dcfad108d9e3a71805125d59267775aa	Obviously you haven't been drinking what I am drinking!

538ceb4acaef4ac2ccf484f71831be0caa	Bob Seger's "Turn the Page"    On a long and lonesome highway, east of omaha.  You can listen to the engine moaning out its one lone song  You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before,  But your thoughts will soon be wandering, the way they always do.  When you're riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do  And you don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through.  Say, here I am, on the road again. there I am, up on the stage.  Here I go, playing star again.  There I go, turn the page.    Well you walk into a restaurant, strung out from the road,  You can feel the eyes upon you as you're shaking off the cold  You pretend it doesnt bother you, but you just want to explode.  Most times you can't hear em talk, other times you can.  Oh the same old cliche, as that woman on her a man  You always see my number, you dont dare make a stand.  Here I am, on the road again. there I am, up on the stage.  Here I go, playing star again.  There I go, turn the page.    Out there in the spotlight you're a million miles away,  Every ounce of energy, you try and give away,  As the sweat pours out your body like the music that you play.  Later in the evening as you lie awake in bed,  With the echo from the amplifiers ringing in your head,  You smoke the days last cigarette, remembering what she said.  Now here I am, on the road again. there I am, up on the stage.  Here I go, playing star again.  There I go, turn the page.    Here I am, on the road again. there I am, up on the stage.  Ah here I go, playing star again.  There I go, there I go.

AA11879371	I found this interesting.  A panel in a comic book IS just the one square.  I was confusing comic book art with animated cartoon art, where each segment of the cartoon is called a cel.      I was assuming a panel in syndicated newspaper comics was the norm.  Actually that is called a comic strip made up of 3 to 4 panels.    Did you notice the confusion?  Cartoon/comic? Almost interchangeable.    A cartoon is an illustration, usually humorous in intent and is usually satirical.      But    Because of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, "cartoon" came to refer to animation.    Read through all the references I've listed and you will see they are confused, also.  That's why I found this question so interesting.  I've learned a lot, now I just need to figure out what it is I have learned.

It goes through a cycle like this every 20 years or so.  Right now, the industry is trying to attract younger people, whom they assume will buy more music, so it is veering away from its true roots.  Once the powers-that-be realize that this formula is self-defeating, it will return to real country music, which again will cycle in another 20 years.

AA12325447	I think only Pam Anderson, the black prostitute, and the people from his home town were real actors.  The others, I think, were regular people.    I thought the movie was good, but not great.  There were a few funny parts, but it didn't flow nicely and some of the scenes weren't funny at all.

Esto es el mnimo exigido, pero lo ideal es que pudiera tocar -a nivel medio- uno de cada familia de instrumentos de la orquesta: uno de cuerda (violn o cello), uno de viento madera o metal (clarinete o trompa) y perfecto si domina el piano y algo de percusin (marimba o timbal).

I was a kid and teen once. But let me ask you this.... Why not put up a page about people that don't like you too and let them post? Not everyone likes teachers, but they do their jobs as good as they can. If they didn't the state would not have certified them. And let me tell ya, getting certified is not easy.

a68d8d26e308c97930e19ec212c92d84aa	Dec. 22 is the first day of the Capricorn sign meaning a cusp (a change between the signs which actually runs a few days before and a few days after the switch.) That generally means that you have certain traits of both signs. You are also under the influence of the Winter Solstice.     I'm a Winter Solstice baby born on the 21st and I have some very interesting Capricorn traits myself. These would be what an astrologer would look at to determine your horoscope readings as well as time of birth and place of birth. So that date in particular would be different for everyone born on that date. The generallities would remain the same. You are a specific and special being so take the time to find out more. Try "tarot.com" or "astro.com" both have some free services and pay services.    As for what happened on your birthday you may want to just seach the net for news stories.    Best wishes and Happy Birthday.|`|af80d1647309f86f55fc445f5101ae0faa	well 22 is a nice number.. but 7 is better............... sorry :)|`|2f8d219be33cafd986b2c03ca7bd3b78aa	well besides the fact that you get gifts twice in one week... there is a book call the true meaning of you birthday and can usually find it in stores like Barns and nobles, and juts sit there and read it...

To get that distorted sound with a guitar, the sound that is put into the amp needs to be higher, lower, or have more power than the amp is capable of putting out.  So to scream, you need to be higher, lower, and/or louder that you vocal chords can really handle.
AA11224073	There are tonnes of them.  other than the art school gig which is the longest one, there are little clips of them doing random things like playing a drum game in Japan, messing around in an airport, etc.  Both disc 1 and 2 have easter eggs.    They are easier to find if you have a DVD player on your laptop.  I haven't watched the DVD in a while and i don't have it in front of me now, but you highlight the band members on the main menu screen in various orders to get them to pop up.  I've only ever done it on a laptop so I don't know how successful it is on a TV/DVD player.  With a laptop, I just clicked around on various things and opened up media player to play individual tracks.      Try their website, maybe it says something on there.  http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk

cb01662c32e08bba7cd8c9b779a916beaa	Kakashi is a loner. I don't think he would be with anybody. But that is something I have been thinking about. Maybe Anko or Tsunade? If he pulls a Reverse Michael Jackson, maybe sakura. I dont think he will ever be with anybody, though.|`|AA11883093	No one of course!!! He will grow up alone and die alone... so sad but so true at the same time...ok dat's my opinion, but i saw sakura and kakashi.. it's still haunting me...it's just plain wrong!!!      Holla|`|9ed626228e019799203bc7e88317a72caa	hmm well dun care but maybe Sakura, I saw a gorgeous fanart for them and then I read the smut that inspired it. (it was okay I guess but I got bored and never finished it -_-) .... Okay nevermind he's fine by himself    but i'd suppose any fangirl who wants him as long it's not Iruka cuz  i want him|`|8b8fa478032f1f753b54306c596cd0ddaa	wow. i have no idea. its such an interesting question. i mean the only girl in the anime that wood have that kind of connection to him wood have been his team mate Rin. but in the story line when he talks to sasuke, he claims that everyone he was close to was dead. so that makes us assume Rin is dead, therefore, Kakashi wood have no one in the anime that he has any sort of connection to. hmmmmmmmmmm in that case them kakashi should be with ME!  yea...      haha i uno pretty good questiion. the only person that i can think of that kibas sister(Hana), tsunades apprentace Shizune,.. hmm ill get back to you if i think of anyone else.|`|8c7d8d8a2cc874d10508c34b1bd99993aa	tsunade's boring secretary.

I reckon if his old team-mate Rin is still alive, her.  If not.. Shisune =D|`|060d6dfcf78b838b4eaaebc4a61d745caa	Kakashi should be rightly paired with Rin. I agree with what someone said earlier:"He's not getting over her". I do believe Kakashi have some feelings for Rin, but oh, well, life never turns out that way. If only Rin is here for him right now! Sigh*~  "Everyone that is close to me are dead right now". Hmmm, a hint for Rin? Hey...that would mean...Rin is close to Kakashi!! heheheheheh, that's the clue!!    But Kakashi is not perverted. I mean, he is a regular guy. He has strong Jutsu and real charisma, never misuse his authority, very cheerful, very strong---the girl that pairs off with him should be anyone but Anko (never!). Especially not Tsunade, not even Kurenai (that would be Asuma).   But then...would not he better be with that Anbu girl who visited him when he was at his friend's grave? She is really pretty, and matured enoough for him emotionally.    comparing Kakashi's personality and overall with Umino Iruka, I personally like Iruka better. He is compatible and more, hmm, I could say Iruka is a guy with very tender feelings. Of all Naruto characters, Iruka is my favourite, the runner up being the grand father of Tsunade the first Hokage. Kakashi is somewhere in the third.     Admittedly, it really would be wonderful to have someone like Iruka as a mate.|`|N5LjRKZoaa	rin but obitto like her and she liked kakashi but they both died well not rin because she disapared (sp).|`|8918d594ed32ca879c7a663a05a8e1e7aa	No one...

ce26672765d1a1ee03dcc40cecaa94a1aa	wow, you must really want an answer for this one, asking the same question five times in different categories!!!!!   anyway, nothing you can do except take a shower when you get home, and clean up sand from the car for the next week ... ... ...|`|3107d8d3f2ad845d2357e5cfc8b2392faa	You wait till you get home and tell to take a bath or shower.|`|cafea661e3fce1da868ce36e2a3c3d25aa	with my nephew he doesn't complain so I don't worry. I just give him a spray down with water afterwards    When I was a kid if I had sand up my butt I'd just go waddle around in the water until it was gone.    I guess if it was an issue you could take them to the washroom. take off their bathing suit, leave them in a stall and wash out and then with a water bottle sit them over the toilet and rinse off the sand into the toilet and then let them redress and get back out in the sand and water!!    that's what I would do anyway!|`|AA10106713	Good question... I wanna know how to get out the sand when its up on MY bathing suit...|`|TVWsdoKXaa	Rinse them as thouroughly as possible.

luzxbhuHaa	If something is dangerous it means to stay away from it.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Im from Montreal and we have been using the word "dangerous" as "sexy" for years. Its a west-indian (caribean) thing...and as you also know "bad" means "cool, good, just as we use "wicked"... |`|AfvLIt8laa	maybe she has an STD or is not on the pill....IDK|`|H7x08UWvaa	It means that girl is dangerous, meaning she'll use you.  She's a bad girl, meaning she's a stripper (he mentions her dancing around a pole in the song)  Basically, that girl is a player/    I guess you could change the words to boy, but you would also have to edit some of the lyrics.  I don't think there would be a guy pole dancer mentioned in a song.  The guy would also be a player though.    Dangerous is a pretty good song :)|`|ZGVFYak9aa	It means the guy who wrote the song is a talentless idiot who wants to capitalize on the fact that people today don't seem to know what good music is.|`|Q6GNAFZQaa	i agree with d3ad guy

iX2g7dTeaa	You could do like a seven things parody, or with like that lyrics, but changed    Maybe something like:    I probably should say this  At times I feel so in love  When I think about the memories, the  memories we share    It is awesome and I know you love me too  It's not possible for me, not to  And now we're standing together  but Nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear    The 7 things I love about you  The 7 things I love about you, oh you  You're sexy, your kind, you're not insecure  You love me,  You make me laugh, you help me  Oh when I cry  I don't know how to live without you  Your friends, you're better then them  You never have to act like them,  I wanna stay with the one I know  And the 7th thing I love the most that you do  You make me love you  you do|`|CdO0aKjraa	Your my sun  when cloudy  YOur my blanket  when im cold  YOur my everything  ANd i love you for that    hope u like!|`|KlbyLesSaa	Maybe take a song like "Love Story" by Taylor Swift and change the lyrics around.    Heres some lines if u wanna make uo ur own song-  "My 1st thought of the day, is you"  "My last thought of the day, is you"    sorry its bad|`|nMmN6dJTaa	Baby, I've loved you for so long  And this feeling has been traveling along with us  I love you a little more every night    I know it isn't perfect, but I'm not good at writing songs about a boyfriend, only about what I wish they were like lol|`|CKP98samaa	This life I'm living is full of thoughts of you and I  I can't sleep a wink at night without you on my mind.  My love for you has grown every second, every day  And through every beat of my heart, I find it's time to say    Chorus:    Every mile, every moment, every whisper  You're still there  Every silence, every dream, every minute  I love that you still care.    You're the best thing in this life of mine  The light that finds my way.  And whenever I feel I have to cry  You are there to say it's okay.    I love you...      That's all I can think of right now...use a repetitive chorus and think of something similar to that first verse for a second verse and bridge.  Good luck!

n7hezV5aaa	I think he's the only one (he and Ashley Greene) that I can honestly say fit the part PERFECTLY.     Let me break it down for ya...(just cuz I wanna share)...    Edward Cullen is described as too perfect to be true, so Robert Pattinson will have to do, because no matter who they chose, he wouldn't be good enough.  I was disappointed with Bella & Rosalie very much so...    Check ou this video I've made with the choices I would have made if I could pick the cast. (Oh...and thanks for letting me vent).    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfYFE5It...|`|af4772f173ca267b8f3a8a7329ca035aaa	I think he is|`|wsCBo2Zkaa	Absolutely!!!! I love Twilight!!!!

Lisa Michelle x x lol x x|`|ZNyimaX3aa	of course. no one could seriously replace him..|`|ulDKq4Nvaa	Yeah I think he is|`|hSSVkiZTaa	I think he's perfect for Jacob. I hate it when actors are changed for sequels, it ruins the story and the whole character. Besides I think he's great as Jacob.|`|m0K1X70kaa	Well. I think he was the best choice for Jacob in Twilight. But I just don't think that he will be able to look the part in the later films. The books describe him as physically looking mid to upper twenties age. I personally think that Steven Strait would be a great choice. But that is my opinion....    Personally, I think that everyone in the movie was the best choice. Alice (Ashley Greene), Jasper (Jackson Rathbone), Emmett (Kellan Lutz), and Carlisle (Peter Facinelli) were absolutely perfect for their roles! Rosalie (Nikki Reed), Edward (Robert Pattinson), and Bella (Kristen Stewart) would be really hard to cast and I think they did good. It would be really hard to pick Rosalie and Edward because everyone has different standards of beauty. Edward is described as being perfect and Rosalie as being the most beautiful woman in the world. Bella would be hard because nearly eveyone imagined themselves as Bella, so someone who is absolutely perfect would not compliment everyone.    But as for Jacob... They did really well! Taylor Lautner was the best choice I think, but I don't think I would put him as Jacob in the last ones. But who knows he might bulk up....!  ;]
JzYlcuXzaa	Some of it was true...check out the link I attached.    http://www.amityvillemurders.com/|`|jAoc49N8aa	yeah i think so...but some facts in the movie are wrong but i think that there was a family that moved and started experiencing supernatural things.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	The book and movies are roughly based on the DeFoe murders and the family that moved into the house afterwards did experience some odd happening around the house.

During the next performance, word spread throughout the whole place, and when the commercial came up, we all started yellin we want George. This is apparntly when there was a 7 minute commerical break. They even sent Vince Gill on the stage to calm us all down. About an hour later, Alan got up to sing, and we were all into Pop A Top. Suddenly he had a grin on his face, and the music changed. It was not before long that we all knew what song he was singing. It got so loud in there, we were all so happy. Then he left, and never came back. He won an award (don't remember what one), and they gave it to another artist beacuse he was not there. The next year he was banned. To my suprise when we booked the CMAs in 2001 two years later, he kinda gave the middle finger to Nashville when he sang "Murder on Music Row"    That is a night i will never forget.

djQ6UyzIaa	I dunno. 2 Points!|`|iXx9SWceaa	I do believe it's called What You Say and it's by Further Down, from their album Seven Years Hard Luck.|`|t41xNOg2aa	The closest thing I found was this:    http://www.garageband.com/song?%7Cpe1%7C...    Not sure if its the right song, but if it is its called "What you say" by further down. I dont think they're a published artist or anything, since I couldn't find this on iTunes or anything, but if you click on the play button on that page it should bring up a window and I think there's a download link there. Not sure if its the right song but the lyrics were:    "No matter what you say I need you anyway I know Im breaking down But I just need you now" so I'm assuming it's the same song.      EDIT: Oops never mind I did find it on iTunes after all. Typed it wrong. So yeah, they are published after all!! Sorry for the mess up!

Ux9lRTaSaa	well, the funniest question I saw was "I don't have a mushroom head penis, I am dependent on mental health services, and my beloved contacts have left me, how do I cope?"    It was SOOOOO funny, I laughed non-stop for at least a minute|`|4TmN5Dohaa	Any thing by BUK

oOVAbKPmaa	They repeatedly ran one last year during the Cincinnati Reds games for a male enhancement product. Can't recall which one, but that's beside the point. Anyway, it began with the man and woman sitting on the couch, and then the woman would get up and slowly strut by him in an effort to lure him upstairs to the bedroom while he was watching some sporting event on TV. All fine and dandy, right? Except for the fact that the woman happened to be a shapely, drop dead gorgeous brunette who hardly portrayed what most women look like today. Everytime they ran that thing, I'd sit there and think to myself, " if they really wanna sell that stuff, why don't they use a woman who's maybe average looking and about 50 pounds overweight? " Woulda been far more realistic, don't ya think?

Not to be crude but to tell you the truth, they just grind up a bunch of chicken (even the bones and stuff you don't normally eat)  and deep fry them.|`|2b0f81fb7bceab4ca7447b2b2061c7dbaa	One.  Every one chicken is squashed into one small bloch of thing, and then fried.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	A lot, because each McNugget isn't just chicken.... It's full of crap.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Six???

But I think it would be awesome!|`|P4RZK3dyaa	i'm not sure... i'd feel like a horrible person reading someone's mind...  and seeing the future would be depressing...|`|9dtrWO5laa	hear peoples thoughts  :)|`|HR6wT7ojaa	hear people's thoughts.|`|Y0w2Pk5kaa	Hear peoples minds/thoughts?????????|`|VJAYmZQIaa	I think I'd hear much more than I ever wanted to hear if I could read minds.

2PTlXs9zaa	I started cutting back this time last year, I was already feeling it with the rising food prices and gasoline. I grew a huge garden and canned and froze and dried enough food to get us through the winter without having to buy a lot. I bought a used car two years ago, gets 38 mpg. I don't buy baked goods, I make them. I'm holding my own.|`|e7410cdd309fbe8be4f14fa845e27703aa	I quit buying name brand everything at the store.  I also don't grocery shop at just one place, I go to whichever store as the best sales for the week.    I quit getting my nails done, mostly because I'm lazy, but because now I use that money to spend on other forms of 'entertainment.'  *cough cough*|`|PXarLma8aa	now I only have one pool boy|`|AA11788494	well I don't go anywhere except to run errands.

I buy cheaper pet food.  I don't eat out much or eat much at all.  I don't do a load of clothes usually unless I have a full load.  I got my phone and internet plan awhile back pretty cheap for about 30 a month.  I drink less soda. I shop at the dollar store.|`|Pm6HDqAIaa	Well, I am still drinking good beer so I guess I should count my blessings.

It's really weird, because it's just been the kids (x2) and me ever since the gas prices zoomed up and eventually brought down the economy.    *I can't even fathom what it would be like to actually go out on a date, anymore (time/expense/etc.), given mortgage responsibilities, putting food on the table, taxes (income/payroll/sales), and the threat of a pay cut on top of it all (thanks, Governor ...).

JVSFEPLSaa	wow... cool story.    June 1, 2008    I was in the kitchen when my toast started burning which set off the smoke alarm. Mind you this was at 1:00 AM and i had already eaten everything else in the refrigerator. Parents rush in think something horrible had happened. I realized then that my constant eating was not only harming me but could potentially hurt others. Parents start crying about my, then, weight problem and i promised myself i would do something about it.  Happy to say that i have stuck to an exercise plan and no longer drink sodas. Been working out everyday since that day and have lost 3 pants sizes and can FINALLY wear a tight shirt w/o a jacket over it.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	That's an awesome revelation. The cool thing about active listening is that by listening you help the other person hear what they're saying, and they can learn a lot about themselves and make their own decisions.    My life is still in the process of changing. If I remember correctly January 17, 2008, I realized what I want to do with my life, and that made a huge difference. I don't struggle with depression to the extent I used to, and I have hope and goals. For some people figuring who they are and what they want out of life can open doors that can change their lives. :o)|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	February 8th 2008, my dad commited suicide. I figured out a day or 2 later. Everything changed after that. I no longer live with my mom or sister, my sister lives with my mom, I live with my grandparents. The whole thing matured me a bit more, the way I look at life and how I run mine were completely altered. I now try to be optomistic. Even though it completely shook my world it changed it for the better, I'm living a much happier life now. I was 15 then, now 16.

She's a very gifted comedienne--her one-woman, Broadway show still ranks among my favorites.    Whoopi can act, but she's not great in all her roles.  I think saddling anyone with the moniker of "role model" is more a burden than a compliment, but I certainly think that women in the entertainment business can learn from her: mostly from her accomplishments and occasionally from her mistakes.  I'd love to go to dinner with Whoopi Goldberg--I'll bet the conversations would be fascinating.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I love Whoppi Goldberg, she has a good head on her shoulder, she does not care what people thinks about her, SHe has this thing were she say what she wants to say and dress the the way she wants to dress, so pretty much she is saying I don't give a f.......|`|Wb1DzxdPaa	her real name is Karen Black|`|b6QzfsMUaa	H.

EelcKF0Vaa	Same here!  I believe that fate does exist, but a person can change their fate too.  I also believe that everything, no matter how good or bad, happens for a reason.|`|Mnm35sjNaa	I believe in both.  The INANIMATE, physical universe is entirely subject to fate.  Human beings are ANIMATE and can anticipate, plan for and use causality for their own purposes.    The universe was ENTIRELY inanimate until life came along.  Everything operated, absolutely, on the principle of causality (cause and effect).  The unfolding universe marches inexorably to its destiny.    Darwin's natural selection tells us that our greatest attribute (intelligence) is necessarily evolved to do what it does: make choices.  Human intelligence is NOT predetermined by some causal chain reaction set off by the Big Bang.  We are INFLUENCED by causality but not absolutely controlled by it.    In physics, causality rules the INANIMATE physical universe.  Until life came along (10 to 12 billion years after the big bang) the universe was entirely inanimate.  With life, matter gained motility: the ability to move about WITHOUT outside influence.  Motility is one obvious difference between animate and inanimate matter.    Many animals, particularly mammals, appear to possess consciousness -- if not intelligence.  Certainly, humans possess both.  The introduction of consciousness wrought another milestone in the history of the universe -- and only animals possess it.    I would define intelligence as the ability to anticipate, plan for, and use causality for independent reasons.  Human intelligence certainly fits that bill.  Human intelligence is the latest milestone in the evolution of life.  This milestone came about in just the last 1 or 2 hundred thousand years: a mere drop in the bucket of cosmic time.  We are on the cusp of an evolutionary revolution that is accelerating at breakneck speed.    The first phase of universal history -- the Inanimate Phase -- lasted 10 to 12 billion years.  The second phase -- the Animate Phase -- has been around for 3.5 billion years.  The most recent phase -- the Human Phase -- has only existed for a hundred thousand years or two.  The duration of these phases are shrinking exponentially.  The next phase might well involve the combination of human intelligence with artificial intelligence.  Who knows?    But one thing's for sure: we ALL live, work, play and plan as if we have free will.  "Hard" determinists might claim that's an illusion.  I claim they can't see the forests for the trees.  Yes, causality is an undeniable fact of physical existence.  However, its absolute realm is the INANIMATE, physical, universe.  For instance, if I hit a billiard ball on the right side, it will veer left every time.  If I hit a worm on the right side, it might coil into a writhing knot or wiggle to the right or accelerate forward or whatever.  Clearly, ANIMATE BEINGS react to causality differently than INANIMATE THINGS.    Human intelligence is another example of why animate beings can't be treated as if they're the same inanimate stuff as the rest of the universe.  If you read the recent neuroscientific literature, you'll find the human brain has many feedback mechanisms performing various functions.  There's at least one feedback mechanism that grants us the power of mind over matter (brain).  This feedback mechanism is reliably demonstrated by the "bio-feedback machine".  With this machine, just a few physiological readouts of subconscious processes allow us to control those processes with a little practice.    Mental feedback is the key to free will.  It seems incredible but we are able -- via mental feedback -- to direct the very brain that spawns our consciousness.  This is a powerful fact because it allows us to counter the inexorable tide of causality.    My favorite example of this is the 1969 manned mission to the moon.  Hard determinists who say that our actions and fate are predetermined by causality, are claiming that all the coordination, cooperation, resources and effort it took to put man on the moon was inevitable and scripted ever since the Big Bang.  If youre a determinist, then you believe all the details involved with putting man on the moon were predetermined billions of years ago.  With a script so precise and mystical, you might as well say God wrote it.    Yeah, right . . . May the the force be with you.    Although we are free agents, any affect we have on the universe will make no difference in the grand scheme of things.  It will continue expanding long after we're all gone forever.    The "compatibilist" view that free will coexists with causality goes much further than determinism to explain our special role in the universe: including our achievements, failures and limitations.

INAR2M8Jaa	Dreams by The Cranberries. It's from their first album.
4XXa7wBxaa	Yes... Those who are involved with prolonged sitting or standing in their daily activities have an increased risk of developing spider veins. Therefore, the weight of the blood continuously pressing against the closed valves causes them to fail, leading to vein distention.    The development of spider veins may occur at any age but usually occurs between 18 and 35 years, and peaks between 50 and 60 years.    Females are affected approximately four to one to males.|`|6D80q5gCaa	No I don't believe so. I've never heard of that before. I think people get spider veins as they age. Also it can be genetic too, if your mother or grandmother etc has them then you might be likely to get them too. Its a natural thing so I wouldn't worry about it. Some people get them removed by a cream or by laser surgery. Do some research and find out or talk with a doctor. Hope this helps :)|`|Dj3w4uCDaa	I've crossed my legs for many years and my legs look good with no spider or varicose veins. You really have to be genetically predisposed towards bad veins, for instance, if there is a history of people in your family with bad veins. Check that out, see if anyone in your family has had vein problems.|`|khJYKSUraa	yes|`|sjSJ0mgoaa	D:    WHAT ?|`|31gyS90Saa	holy lick my balls batman  holy magic carpet ride batman  holy giddy gumdrops batman  holy lesbian strippers batman  holy old lady batman batman  holy i love you batman  holy walk the path of oo batman!  yes|`|71LKbJV5aa	yea it does     =c|`|41479d464ed912b4157bcb71a2bae530aa	what's spider veins?|`|1PGmB4JNaa	i don't think so i mean all women do that so we'd all be ickyyy P:|`|a4LWildhaa	I have beautiful legs, no veins showing and I never shave them. I cross them as well.|`|HRQjffv8aa	Nope, standing up for hours causes them|`|Hm7MtmYPaa	No, crossing your legs keep you from getting unwanted STDs and children.  Keep it up!|`|EQeX35dWaa	no.   get lots of exercise and you will be fine.|`|5Ra5xbziaa	it shouldn't|`|bDEd9pTOaa	I feel sick now.

vYTRMm69aa	If I said what it is, it wouldn't be a Valentine's Surprise, now would it ?  Hmm, I personally hope if someone is Special enough to be considered ones Valentine that they show it in some way every day of their life  :)   I may be back with more, just maybe.  BTW, nice question for a day of love, You're cute Foxy, love Joey.xxx  EDIT: I am back, here's the thing about Valentine's Day, I really believe it should be kept simple, but filled with the true feeling of love. If two people are together it would be nice to spend that day just with each other, for instance, if it is a work day, plan for you both to take the day off and begin the day with a luxurious bath together sipping on mimosa and maybe croissants with strawberries. Hmm, now after that I would take my Sweety back to bed and lets leave that to your imagination. Then hide little sweet love notes and suggestions around the house but of course where he will easliy see them. After spending most of the day loving one another, I think a nice dinner at a favourite dining place you both like, could end the day and then back home infront of a nice warm fireplace sipping on champagne and making love. hmmm, sigh, One thing I do love is to give a Beautiful Valentine's Day card, and maybe something personal I know he really wants, but a gift is not what it is all about. :)|`|QaOj0nQLaa	Hmmm... last year I covered my boyfriend's car with a bunch of red, pink, and white post-it notes that I wrote saying "I love you" and "Be Mine" and other cute stuff like that. And if your'e 'special one' doesn't have a car, you should do it on his/her locker, door, mailbox, or something.. :) hope this helps! Good Luck!|`|8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	jewelry is nice...

BmrKFfYjaa	Got a letter from Grandma the other day. She writes... The other day I went up to a local Christian bookstore and saw a "Honk If You Love Jesus " bumper sticker. I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting; so I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.    Boy, I'm glad I did! What an uplifting experience that followed! I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection just lost in thought about the Lord and how good He is...and I didn't notice that the light had changed. It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed!    I found that LOTS of people love Jesus Why, while I was sitting there, the guy behind me started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, "For the love of GOD! GO! GO! JESUS CHRIST, GO!"    What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus! Everyone started honking! I just leaned out of my window and started waving and smiling at all these loving people. I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love!    There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a "sunny beach"... I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. When I asked my teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant, he said that it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something.    Well, I've never met anyone from Hawaii; so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign back. My grandson burst out laughing...why even he was enjoying this religious experience!    A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed. So, I waved to all my sisters and brothers, grinning, and drove on through the intersection.    I noticed I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and I felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared; so I slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away.    Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!

What a powerful river! What beautiful animals!" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. Turning to look, he saw a 13-foot Kodiak brown bear beginning to charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could down the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was rapidly closing on him. Somehow, he ran even faster, so scared that tears came to his eyes. He looked again and the bear was even closer. His heart pounding in his chest, he tried to run faster yet. But alas, he tripped and fell to the ground. As he rolled over to pick himself up, the bear was right over him, reaching for him with its left paw and raising its right paw to strike him.    "OH MY GOD! ..."    Time stopped.    The bear froze.    The forest was silent.    Even the river stopped moving ...    As a brilliant light shone upon the man, a thunderous voice came from all around...    "YOU DENY MY EXISTENCE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, TEACH OTHERS THAT I DON'T EXIST AND EVEN CREDIT CREATION TO SOME COSMIC ACCIDENT. DO YOU EXPECT ME TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT? AM I TO COUNT YOU AS A BELIEVER?"    Difficult as it was, the atheist looked directly into the light and said, "It would be hypocritical to ask to be a Christian after all these years, but perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?"    "VERY WELL." Said God.    The light went out.    The river ran.    The sounds of the forest resumed.    ... and the bear dropped down on his knees, brought both paws together, bowed his head and spoke: "Lord, thank you for this food which I am about to receive."|`|3ULjjUNlaa	Two men walk into a bar, one ducks.

Then I put one where I talked forever and her mother had to cut it of in the middle of it because I talked too much!    then I left one saying,    "Hey call me back!"I forgot to say my name so ten minutes later I had to say,    "This was krissie!"Then I hung up!    lol!:)|`|Jgc7S1ffaa	Hi, this is Schleprock!

Everyone else, including work knows i will get to them at my earliest convience, thats the best i can do.  honeychild.
cIqpL3tGaa	I dont have an opinion, and mind you nothing is set in stone, they are in talks.|`|cvh6u58Daa	So far they are just in talks, but its very possible she will play Jane since she is scene as a mature actress.|`|P6lFNVtiaa	no cause in the book she is a young girl, and they asked her if she wanted to but they are still casting i also heard that Vanessa something....zack efrons girlfriend might play leah clearwater|`|nIfOozNNaa	ya i thought of the character older but yet again i fink she will good because i really like hide and seek a film she has starred in, i cant wait for new moon|`|DRlwdZlDaa	She's an awesome actress but I don't really like her for the role. I wanted AnnaSophia Robb, she seems a little more young even though she's actually older.|`|UHX0jZ8gaa	wel from wat i heard dakota fanning is playing jane.but like u said,i picture her older.but vanessa hudgens might be playing leah clearwater.i think she'll do good|`|nRgWDZWcaa	what?!  hmmm...i dunno if i can really imagine her like jane. i always thought of jane being an older person too.|`|mirOK6Bzaa	I like Dakota Fanning and her little sister Elle are both adorable. I think she would be really good.|`|nZhHOzYfaa	In the book Jane and Alec are like 10 years old.  I think Dakota would be fantastic shes young enough and shes still pretty. Maybe not vampire pretty but still pretty.

KdCzS5Q4aa	Robert Pattinson.  He has a more manly look.  Zac Efron looks very feminine and tbh, gay!|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	Zac Efron is ugly so I choose Robert Pattinson because we're both from London.|`|hCI6HFEnaa	Ha ha. That's pathetic. Zac Efron is a retarded and shockingly feminine GIRL.    I'd say neither, but in this case deifintely Robert.    (Racheel, she asked who's fitter, not 'why don't you like them?'. )|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	sorry, I don't judge the fitness of girls.|`|5lmC19GLaa	zac efron - his hair and eyes are perfect !!!      robert pattinson was hot when he played edward cullen in twilight.|`|sN1lPrOUaa	ZAC EFRON ALL THE WAY !     PATTINSON IS NOT HOT!!|`|WsHSuP8baa	Zac! hes hot and has abs,    robert is just fugly|`|kdmhuVTEaa	I'd say Robert. But to be honest i don't like either. I mean Robert is a good actor, and who cares if he drinks. He likes to have a good time. Good for him!    Neither of them really are my taste.|`|DTW0704Faa	Joe Jonas =)|`|DSeG6nFcaa	Robert Pattinson just because he's hot|`|QPyFTOhYaa	rob pattinson coz he looks maly and zac efron looks like a child plus rob pattinson is well fit =)|`|ZYA0Rt7Haa	No offence but neither. Woot woot Mark Owen is fit :)|`|bOPCnScpaa	i prefer robert pattinson|`|59AiKKuCaa	well i think zac efron looks like a toad and plays in some really bad movies. and robert pattinson is hot. and he has a heelarious personality, seriously you should watch it on youtube.  and if he does smoke and drink, i bet zac efron does way worse. and many many people drink, it isnt that bad.  at first i prefered him in twilight, but now its a tie.|`|nsbF7ncxaa	Most say Zac Efron but personally Robert Patterson...i think|`|Yazpoadnaa	Zac Efron.    Robert Pattinson smoke and drinks.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	i would have to say Robert Pattinson, even when he was in Twilight I mean he had a rockin body.|`|ObLLoo66aa	i think rob pattinson is fitter because they both hav abs but robs are more toned the both look amazing in all movies theyve been in but rob plays better parts in slightly better movies that get his good side and thirdly in twilight he looks hot and since twilight is such a good movie better than high school musical|`|dUBRceBcaa	Neither!  Roy Stride is the most gorgeous man ever.|`|VJZKdkpmaa	robert pattinson    zac efron is girly !!    robert pattinsons more realistic and scruffy ..  zac efron is too perfect and you wouldnt want to stand nextto him..    i hate perfection i like my men scruffy :D
OmWamvEvaa	Two blondes went to the pound where each adopted a puppy. The joy of their new best friend was quickly overshadowed when they got home and the first blonde said, "I think we're in trouble, how are we going to tell them apart?"      This lead to several hours of concentration until finally, the second blonde said, "I've got an idea. We'll tie a red bow around my puppy and a blue bow around yours."      The next day the first blonde comes running up to the second when she got home, "Oh no, I can't tell whose puppy is whose. They've pulled the ribbons off while they were playing."      "OK, we need to find a better way to tell them apart," says the second blonde.   After several more hours of concentration, they came up with the bright idea of getting different colored collars.      Again, the next day, the first blonde comes running up to the second as soon as she gets home, "Oh no, I can't tell whose puppy is whose. They've pulled their collars off while they were playing."    "There's got to be some way to tell them apart," says the second blonde.      After several more hours of concentration, the first blonde finally comes up with another idea, "I know! Why don't you take the black one and I'll take the white one!"|`|VC5mEULTaa	A joke....    um....

The news crew was covering a story of a  man on a ledge of a large building preparing to jump.     The blonde looked at Bob and said, "Do you think he'll jump?"     Bob says, "You know, I bet he'll jump."     The blonde replied, "Well, I bet he won't."     Bob placed a $20 bill on the bar and said, "You're on!"     Just as the blonde placed her money on the bar, the guy on the ledge did  a swan dive off the building, falling to his death.     The blonde was very upset, but willingly handed her $20 to Bob, saying,  "Fair's fair. Here's your money."     Bob replied, "I can't take your money, I saw this earlier on the 5 PM  news and so I knew he would jump."     The blonde replied, "I did too; but I didn't think he'd do it again."     Bob took the money...|`|40HpQquSaa	a blonde girl really has to fart when shes on the bus.She notices that the music is loud on the bus and decides to let it out.

EaurpLufaa	Despite her dysfunctional home life, Winfrey skipped two of her earliest grades, became the teacher's pet, and by the time she was 13 received a scholarship to attend Nicolet High School in the Milwaukee suburb of Glendale, Wisconsin.  After suffering years of abuse, at 13 Winfrey ran away from home.  When she was 14, she became pregnant, but her son died shortly after birth.  Also at that age, her frustrated mother sent her to live with her father in Nashville, Tennessee.  Vernon was strict, but encouraging and made her education a priority.  Winfrey became an honors student, was voted Most Popular Girl, joined her high school speech team at East Nashville High School, and placed second in the nation in dramatic interpretation.  She won an oratory contest, which secured her a full scholarship to Tennessee State University, a historically black institution, where she studied communication.  At age 17, Winfrey won the Miss Black Tennessee beauty pageant.  She also attracted the attention of the local black radio station, WVOL, which hired her to do the news part-time.  She worked there during her senior year of high school, and again while in her first two years of college.

He climbed up on a car and randomly picked a blonde out of the crowd.   She got up on the car too and the man asked: "What is the first month of the year?"   The blonde responded: "November?"    "Nope," said the man. At this point the crowd began to chant, "Give her another chance, give her another chance."     So the man asked: "What is the capital of the U.S.A ?"   The blonde responded: "Paris?"  So the crowd began chanting again: "Give her another chance, give her another chance."     The man said: "Okay, but this is the last one. What is one plus one?"

What a powerful river! What beautiful animals!" he said to himself. As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. Turning to look, he saw a 13-foot Kodiak brown bear beginning to charge towards him. He ran as fast as he could down the path. He looked over his shoulder and saw that the bear was rapidly closing on him. Somehow, he ran even faster, so scared that tears came to his eyes. He looked again and the bear was even closer. His heart pounding in his chest, he tried to run faster yet. But alas, he tripped and fell to the ground. As he rolled over to pick himself up, the bear was right over him, reaching for him with its left paw and raising its right paw to strike him.    "OH MY GOD! ..."    Time stopped.    The bear froze.    The forest was silent.    Even the river stopped moving ...    As a brilliant light shone upon the man, a thunderous voice came from all around...    "YOU DENY MY EXISTENCE FOR ALL THESE YEARS, TEACH OTHERS THAT I DON'T EXIST AND EVEN CREDIT CREATION TO SOME COSMIC ACCIDENT. DO YOU EXPECT ME TO HELP YOU OUT OF THIS PREDICAMENT? AM I TO COUNT YOU AS A BELIEVER?"    Difficult as it was, the atheist looked directly into the light and said, "It would be hypocritical to ask to be a Christian after all these years, but perhaps you could make the bear a Christian?"    "VERY WELL." Said God.    The light went out.    The river ran.    The sounds of the forest resumed.    ... and the bear dropped down on his knees, brought both paws together, bowed his head and spoke: "Lord, thank you for this food which I am about to receive."    ______________________________________...      A Mexican family crosses the border to the Land of Milk and Honey where the streets are paved with gold .. But the husband can find no work. His family is hungry, so he takes a walk to a quiet place at the foot of a big hill, kneels at the base of a tree, and begins to pray:    "Sweet Jesus, please show me a way to feed my family..." Eyes  closed, the Mexican does not see the Black man coming over the top of the hill, who is struggling with a broken grocery sack and who loses a wheel of cheese. When the Mexican man opens his eyes, the large wheel of Cheddar cheese from the Black man's grocery bag rolls down the hill and lands at the Mexican's feet!!    Oh, thank you Jesus, thank you", he cries, grabs the cheese, and runs straight home. Upon returning home, he gives the cheese to his wife and instructs her to make nachos.    "But wouldn't you rather have cheese enchiladas and burritos and other things?" she inquires."No, the husband says, "Jesus sent this to me with a message...as I ran home, I kept hearing a voice yelling.......    "THAT'S NACH-YO CHEESE"|`|oZOwzr8iaa	i'm a blonde, thank you very muchhh. :)|`|RtHBnYSmaa	Are you in elementary school?|`|rDgOkpcaaa	OH WOW|`|OmWamvEvaa	Three blondes were walking through the forest when they came upon a set of tracks.

So the brunette threw the banana down, then the red head threw the apple down, and the blonde threw the bomb down. When they got off of the plane, they saw a boy crying, so they went up to him and asked, "little boy, why r u crying?" The little boy said that a banana hit him on the head. Then they saw a girl crying, and they went up to her and asked, "Little girl, y r u crying?" The little girl said that an apple hit her on the head, then there was a little boy laughing. So they asked, "Little boy, y r u laughing?" Then the boy said, "My dad farted and then the entire house blew up!"  LOL :)
ox4MdqcVaa	I don't hate them. What I DO hate is how some of the people who really like them say everything else sucks. They will generalize other music, yet the expect people to know everything about theirs. They say everything else sucks even if they don't know what their talking about. They will rant on about your horrible music even if they don't know what you listen to. I've had a metallica fan tell me my music sucks even though I like some metallica. Finally, they won't take the time to make an educated argument about your music. I'm not saying they all do it, but many of the people who are really into metallica tend to get like that and it annoys me because they have never heard most of the bands I listen to so therefore cannot seriously criticise it.|`|MXjvZMUXaa	Because they're gay.

Nothing beats the original. Perhaps it falls into the "too old" category you want to avoid, but this movie is disturbing from start to finish.|`|ZRKVSyJnaa	well those movies are ok i guess, not really much for scary though. A couple good ones are the 2003 remake (this one is a GOOD remake) of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it's pretty scary but not one that has a lot of those sudden movements that make you jump instantly. I think that happens one time in the movie. I'm 12 and my friends and i watched it on halloween. We didn't want to get too scared so we totally made fun of the actions of the people. But others are the original Nightmare on Elm Street, most Friday the 13th movies. But if you are looking for in theaters, most horror movies suck nowadays. But one that looks good is the new Friday the 13th, comes out in a few weeks, its from the producer of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003).

I was always the one that people picked on in school, I could count the number of friends I had on one hand. Now they ask me for help because while they were hanging out with their friends and blowing off school because going to parties and getting drunk was more important I was attempting to understand the inner workings of the universe by researching theoretical physics and advanced mathematics. We're not losers. We're clever...    Always remember, popularity lasts 12 years (max... unless, of course, they fail a few grades. :P). Intelligence lasts a lifetime.    Good luck. You'll go far in this world...|`|u3xDS7i8aa	no you're smart|`|AA10227117	your not a loser.|`|u9RaMuiGaa	i'm sort of similiarr :)    i get A*-Bs in my lessons =]    i have friends and i HATE the popular crew >.    i       i know people who're like that too and they're amazing       so to answer your question no your not a loser!! :D      xxxx|`|24b6316a6569b9393f0ae2fe42268e69aa	In ten years some of those popular people will end up losers.
