Doesn't he just push the Republican base further right, alienating moderates and pushing them to the Democratic side? Why doesn't the Democratic party want to Rush to get as powerful as possible, riling up 25% of the country as much as he can and pushing 75% to the Democrats? Any insights as to why the Democrats want to push him into the corner?
20090131112707AAtrIzt	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can people with epilepsy ride motorized Bicycle?	I have epilepsy; so I know very well what it's like to have seizures. And I also know that most if not all people with epilepsy cant get a driver's liscence until they are at least 6 months seizure free.      But my question can a person with epilepsy legally ride a motorized bicycle? I've been thinking about putting a motor (likely electric rather than gas) on my bicycle.It's only a small little suburb where I live,but there are plenty of cops patroling where I live;I been waived down and asked questions on at least a couple if not several ocassions.      So I dont wanna be riding a motorized bicyle and get stoped by a cop only to show that I only have a State ID and not an actual drivers liscence.Given my epilepsy limitations I dont really go anywhere far except the mall to catch the bus and/or train.      So is legal for an epileptic without a drivers liscence to ride a motorized bicycle? And I dont know if it helps at all but I live in Dallas,TX.

However I am a bit surprised at his lack of response at the devastating ice storms in the Midwest. Especially this early in his presidency. Surely he knows how closely people are watching him right now.      I mean, I'm reading about millions of people without power or resources who are literally FREEZING to death because they have no heat, no gas, and no safe roads on which to escape even if they HAD gas. At the same time, I'm reading about Obama getting ready to throw a big Superbowl Party in the Whitehouse. Is it just me, or does publicized "partying" seem a little inapproriate at this time? As far as I know, Obama has not publicly addressed this weather situation, is that correct? If he has, please send me a link to the story or video, as I have been unable to locate it myself. Thank you.

20090131114157AAutJyu	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Work bonus not paid, should it be taken to small claims court?	My sister recently quit her job due to her newly-hired manager being disrespectful and not accomidating her schedule while she was in college. She gave two weeks notice in a professional email to her manager. Each year, the employees get a profit-sharing bonus which is calculated on January 31st. Bonuses are to be handed out the last day she works, February 8th, but her manager has decided to withhold payment of my sister's bonus since she quit.      What course of action should she pursue? Contact someone else higher up in the company? If that doesn't work, should she go to small claims court? The amount of the bonus in question is likely only to be $50 - $100, but I think it's worth pursuing simply because her boss is being indignant about the whole thing and has been power-tripping and treating all of the employees poorly for months now.
20090131113339AAGjA10	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My sister is constantly getting harassed by her manager, is there anything I can do?	My sister used to date her manager for 3 years, and as soon as they broke up he started harassing her at work. He grabs her, pushes her, calls her names, he spit on her, then fired her, rehired her, and then started harassing her all over again. He's also asking her personal questions, and takes her aside while working to pretty much try and get in her business. He also stole her Iphone out of her purse while she was working. She has tried to talk to the owner, but since the owner is his dad, he doesn't really care. She told him to check the camera so she could prove that his son stole her phone, but he refuses to because he doesn't believe her. I keep telling my sister to sue him and quit, but she refuses to do anything about it because she "needs" that job. She  currently has another job at Subway, and she doesn't have any large payments, all she has is her car insurance and her phone bill to pay for. She doesn't go to college and she's done paying off her car; she also still lives at home so she doesn't have rent. She really doesn't need this job, but she won't listen to me. She's constantly complaining  about what her manager is doing to her, and I don't know how I can help.

I think I had the right to expect to receive my W2 before the 31st (the day I'm actually writing this) and I planned accordingly. As such, I'm now going to miss the deadline set by my landlord for payment of my rent. I was relying on my tax return to pay the back rent and now I will my landlord will be taking legal action to have me evicted and make sure that they are able to collect on my rent. This is almost an automated process for them. As such, even if I am able to pay my rent and avoid the eviction if, as my employer claims, I will recieve my W-2 forms on Monday, February 2nd, I will still owe my landlord for the courtcosts as is a part of my lease agreement. Because my employer has missed their legal deadline for providing me with last years W-2 forms I feel they are responsiable for my misfortune. Is this grounds for a lawsuit?

20090131121904AAVSvoV	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	For women receiving social service benefits, if there was a penalty for having more illegitimate children, ?	would the incidence of illegitimate births go down, if a woman and man were penalized, for example, less welfare for each additional child born out of wedlock,  do you think this would lower the rate of illegitimate babies born in the US? The way the system is set up today is that the more illegitimate children a woman has the more benefits she receives. Since women and men have been given a full range of reproductive rights nowadays some of these people just can't be responsible anymore. What gives in our society besides the taxpayers pocketbook? and actually I would say it is none  of my business but the problem is I have to pay for these irresponsible women and their children, therefore it is my business as well as any person who pays taxes. Actually, if you don't pay taxes you don't have a right to answer this question.

I was one of those people. In the past I have always voted democrat because I saw them as the lesser of 2 evils, but in this race I didn't see a lesser of two evils. You see, I'm not republican. I am not conservative. I'm not rich. But I'm also not stupid and do take it upon myself to do as much research as I can on the candidates and understand the game of politics that they play.

However, "B" cannot proceed with performing the service until "A" fills out an application form and signs it.

It turns out that "B" went ahead and filled out the mandated application form on "A's" behalf and even signed "A's" signature for her.   Within 18 days, "A" decides she wants no part of the whole deal and leaves town.  What should happen next?  Is this a breach of contract?  And if not, what is it?

I have some questions about that:   -Is it as soon as you find out you`re pregnant, or after the baby is born?   -Is it really automatic or do you still have to go to court?   -If you put the baby up for adoption, would you still be emancipated?   -Are there any restrictions on what you do? Can you move out of state, town, etc.?   Any other info would be appreciated.      Is is true that the same emancipation applies if you get married? How would you get married since its illegal if you`re underage (I think).         Thanks.

20090131124823AAO0liA	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can someone with a misdemeanor that plead no contest get it expunged in CA?	It’s been 5 years since I was convicted for a misdemeanor on petty theft. I was barely 18 (young and dumb) and spent 30 days in jail, (due to jail overcrowding, I only spent 10% of the time and was released with time served after 3 days)   But before it was permanently on my record, fresh out of jail, I got a job working for a large financial company doing Customer Service and general office work. But due to a series of unfortunate events, just recently, the company laid me and several hundreds of people due to the current economic situation.       Now that I'm 23, I've had this misdemeanor on my record for over 5 years, now everywhere I apply they run background checks and it pops up.. I know that stealing was a foolish thing to do. I was immature at the time but I can now say, I’ve lived a honest and hard working life ever since my mistake, but I can’t seem to escape my past.      Is there any chance that I can get my misdemeanor expunged when it was a no contest plea?

Before the 2008 election, I overheard my boss (who is a republican) mention to another co-worker (who is also repub) that if Obama got elected, he would have to cut back on employees in order to stay in business. Two weeks ago, myself and about 13 other employees all got PINK SLIPS!!!!!!!!! The other 12 employees were also Obama supporters. None of the people supporting McCain were fired. We confronted the boss about it and he basically just said "we made our own bed  " and told us we were lucky he hadn't fired us before Christmas. The remaining employees all got bonuses! WTF?      The boss claims we were fired because we come in to work late and leave early. Who (*)#@$ cares? Everyone does that! How can I prove that my boss is racist and sue him? Not everyone that was pro-Obama was fired, but everyone fired was pro-Obama.      PS. The boss always wrote using blue ink even though he had a whole cup full of black pens on his desk too. I NEVER saw him use a black pen. He was always discriminatory and chose blue!      HELP!!!!!!!!      PS. I have asked this question a couple times because I need someone who can sue for free. I don't have money pay, but once Obama redistributes the wealth I can pay some back, maybe.

20090131145522AA9dZXw	Politics & Government;Politics	Why doesn't Obama call his bill what it is, 'Trickle up Poverty'?	Poor people are poor mostly because they don't work hard, don't save, and blow money on drinking or gambling or some form of entertainment.  I know plenty of folks who have a big screen TV, an SUV, visit the casinos or spend a chunk on lottery tickets and frequent the local bar.  They'll spend $50-$60 a week on cigarettes then complain they can't afford health insurance or a nice house.  If you handed these people $100K cash it'd be gone in a year with little to show for it.  We all know people like this, and they're jealous of those of us who work hard, save, and invest.  Why doesn't Obama just admit it's easier to take money from the rich than get poor people to spend wisely and save?

This is what some of the bill includes.      FOCA would:       # Eliminate regulations that protect women from unsafe clinics and unscrupulous abortionists   # Force American taxpayers to fund abortions   # Force every state to allow partial-birth abortion---its sponsors have said a primary purpose of the bill is to ensure that killing partially born children will again be permitted nationwide   # Run roughshod over conscience rights of physicians, nurses, and hospitals that oppose abortion on religious, moral and ethical grounds   # Strip parents of their right and responsibility to be involved in their minor daughter’s abortion decision.

I have rented with my current landlord for 2 years.  First was in a studio apartment for a year lease and then I went month to month until I got into the two bedroom apartment with a one year lease.  My lease is up August 1st of this year.  My fiance and I are going to be moving in August in our new home.  Thing is, I told the landlord and he said that we can't go month to month after Augsut 1st.  I have NEVER been late and they refuse to let us live there for ONE EXTRA MONTH.  My lease now says my residency there terminates once lease is up but last time my lease was up I was able to go month to month.  Now that I will no longer be living in the complex he says that wecan't go month to month.  Do I have the legal right to just stay one more month?  Technically, if I stay, I don't need to pay for August rent because I paid the last month's rent when I first got the place last year.

20081121090440AAkuuN1	Politics & Government;Politics	Adults as third graders?	The most eye-opening civics lesson I ever had was while teaching third grade in 2000. The presidential election was heating up and some of the children showed an interest. I decided we would have an election for a class president. We would choose our nominees. They would make a campaign speech and the class would vote. To simplify the process, candidates were nominated by other class members. We discussed what kinds of characteristics these students should have. We got many nominations and from those, Jamie and Olivia were picked to run for the top spot. The class had done a great job in their selections. Both candidates were good kids. I thought Jamie might have an advantage because he got lots of parental support. I had never seen Olivia's mother.        The day arrived when they were to make their speeches Jamie went first. He had specific ideas about how to make our class a better place. He ended by promising to do his very best. Every one applauded.        He sat down and Olivia came to the podium. Her speech was concise.   She said, 'If you will vote for me, I will give you ice cream.' She sat down.      The class went wild. 'Yes! Yes! We want ice cream.'   She surely would say more. She did not have to. A   discussion followed. How did she plan to pay for the ice   cream? She wasn't sure. Would her parents buy it or   would the class pay for it. She didn't know. The class   really didn't care. All they were thinking about was   ice cream. Jamie was forgotten. Olivia won by a land slide.       Every time Barack Obama opens his mouth he offers ice   cream, and 60% percent of America reacts like nine year   olds. They want ice cream. The other 40% percent know   they're going to have to feed the cow.

'After numerous rounds of 'We don't even know if Osama is still alive',  Barrack Hussein Obama has now been telling everyone he will capture Osama Bin Laden when elected.'           So, Osama himself decided to send Barrack Hussein Obama a letter in his own handwriting to let him know he was still in the game.       Obama opened the letter and it contained a single line of coded message:              370H-SSV-0773H               Obama was baffled, so he e-mailed it to Howard Dean.       Dean and the DNC and his aides had no clue either, so they sent it to Joe Biden.       Joe Biden could not solve so it was sent to the FBI and the CIA.       Eventually they asked John McCain and his Staff to look at it.       And within a few minutes McCain's Staff e-mailed Obama with this reply:  'Tell Obama he's holding the message upside down'.

20090123091118AAbjhAX	Politics & Government;Politics	Have the Obama lies begun?	Obama said no lobbyists, but he just appointed one?      Experts and watchdogs say they cannot fathom how President Obama's choice for the Pentagon's second-in-command, currently a lobbyist for a defense giant, could be nominated under the principles of his new ethics rules.        http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?...    President Obama has nominated William J. Lynn to serve as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Experts and watchdogs say they cannot fathom how President Obama's choice for the Pentagon's second-in-command, currently a lobbyist for a defense giant, could be nominated under the principles of his new ethics rules.       "It appears to be a black-and-white case. I am unaware of what makes it so gray in the mind of President Obama," said Winslow T. Wheeler, a former congressional budget staffer now with the Center for Defense Information, on the president's choice of Raytheon lobbyist William J. Lynn to serve as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Wheeler said it would take a "gigantic loophole" to squeeze Lynn, a top executive for defense giant Raytheon who registered to lobby for the company as recently as last June, into the office.       Obama's executive order, which he signed Tuesday, would appear to ban lobbyists like Lynn from working in executive branch jobs related to the work of their former employers. Moreover, it would force appointees to recuse themselves from any business their former employers might have an interest.

With all of that said I feel that the election has divided the country, not so much black and white, but Obama supporters and Non-Obama supporters.  I say this because 61% of Obama's votes came from the white voting population, the rest from the young voters, and minorities.  Every since the election people have been very hostile towards each other and I cannot help but feel that something is brewing.  Do any of you have this same feeling, and why do you think it is?

I don't believe in the death penalty as we have it - too many are wrongly convicted, the rich don't get executed, etc.  How about if we made capital punishment more of a "punishment" - wouldn't it make more sense?  Over the years it has been diminished from burning at the stake, to electrocution, to be pricked with a needle.  How about crucifixion?  Or better yet, do it like Iran does and whip them before you hang them?  Give them some pain before they die.  That's the only way I see it as being a "punishment."  What do you think?

I was told my cousin used my identity recently when pulled over by the police. She had no license with her and no license for that matter. She gave my name, birthday and address. Her hair and eyes are the same color as mine but we look nothing alike. If this is true, wouldn't the cop have seen the picture from my valid drivers license on his computer screen in the car? I am concerned because I don't know if they asked her my SS# and now I am terrified she will open up credit cards if she has this info. Do the police ask for a social? Geeze I hope not or she knows about me that I ever imagined. She did not end up getting a ticket or warning so I don't know how there would be a record of this occurence. Thanks

I'm a foreigner working for a large US high-tech company that is full of politics. I contributed to many products, patents, and publications. Got many awards, and get paid OK. But management skipped my ranking promotion year over year and promoted the Caucasians with less technical skills and contribution. Many of those promoted have better "team-work skills", i.e., cooking cakes for the dept., baby sitting for senior people... Lately, several peers told me it is unfair and advised me to try the corporate "Appeal" process. I'm a technical person, no experience with HR. HR (kindly) advised me to think carefully, not to burn bridges with management. I'd like to know the consequences of the HR Appeal action. Also, if the HR process gets tangles in politics and fails, do I have any option for external legal procedure (law suit)? If so, how much will it cost? Of course, I'm also preparing to jump ship, and sacrifice some stock options.

I never would have thought that an article I read would say this, but it said that the fact that Palin is pretty is bad news for the female vote.

It goes on to say that it is very common for girls to get together and share their frustration of a pretty girl who gets more attention.  They even muse as to whether the pretty girl deserves all that attention and is only successful because of looks.  Isn't this a very stereotypical and short-sighted view of women?

Nel pronunciamento del giudice si legge che la tecnica di intercettazione usata dall'FBI è in grado di funzionare indipendentemente dal fatto che il cellulare sia acceso o meno. Secondo gli esperti di controspionaggio, infatti, alcuni modelli di dispositivi portatili prodotti da Nextel e da Samsung, e la serie Razr di Motorola, sarebbero particolarmente utili da questo punto di vista.   Senza la rimozione forzata della batteria, hanno dichiarato gli agenti dell'FBI, alcuni cellulari possono essere attivati a distanza con un download remoto, senza alcun accesso fisico e all'insaputa del proprietario. Ed è proprio questa la tecnica che sarebbe stata utilizzata dagli agenti: attivando indisturbati a chilometri di distanza un microsoftware spione piazzato sui Nextel di Ardito e Peluso, hanno potuto ascoltare con tutta calma il mob speech dei due ovunque fossero.

I'm talking about the economy, elections, war....etc..---Are the facts.....really the facts, or are the "facts" really just what you are "supposed" to believe? So many opinions about every issue--- on the news, youtube, yahoo answers...etc..... it's getting to the point where I have to "be on location" and witness every single event in the world/country, to even believe anything.       Sometimes I think this country is more than just divided anymore...... like first it was divided and now those 2 halves are divided and so on! Just so many opinions. I want the truth! Don't you?      I hope and pray for the best, because that's my go-to answer.

Per tutti quelli che stanno per scrivere baggianate vi dico cosa evitare di dire: 1- Prodi ha a suo tempo dichiarato in sede giudiziaria (oltre che alla stampa) di aver sentito il nome Gradoli in una seduta spiritica, quindi non dite che è un invenzione. 2- Preso atto del fatto che lui ha detto così (e su questo non si discute), evitate di dire che era in tono ironico perchè non era così (inoltre l'ironia non è molto apprezzata davanti ai giudici). 3-Tutti quelli che credono che possa davvero essere stato uno spirito a digli: 'GRAAADOLI!' non scrivano nulla perchè non mi interessa la chiaroveggenza. Quindi come si spiega il tutto? Che contatti aveva Prodi per aver saputo di Gradoli? Io non lo so visto che è estremamente improbabile che avesse contatti diretti con le BR; con l'URSS poteva semmai averne... bahh chissà, mistero..

I know God will rewards me in anything I've done in life it doesn't matter if good or bad..What I mean my husband didn't have a right to judges on me that I'm hypocrite..in a way I may get mad and sometimes don't want to answer the phone but that';s nothing than to commit an adultery or other crazy thing a wife/ husband  can  do behind his spouse back without his/her knowing.
