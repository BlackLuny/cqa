PDotv2Hsaa	You have my sympathies. A sinus infection can be both viral and bacterial. Or in my case, it's usually allergens such as dust mites that I'm sensitive to.

3mAgM405aa	Even though we do not know where you can physically purchase silver bullion in L.A., the following comment from Consumer Reports should be heeded as it also applies to silver as well as to gold:<br>  <br>  [quote]  When it comes to your portfolio, inflation can wreak havoc by deflating the value of traditional retirement investments such as fixed-rate bonds. So consider investing at least a portion of your assets with an eye toward inflation as you edge closer to retirement. Here are some investments that can help you do that:<br>  <br>  Gold. ....  gold [silver] produces no income and can be costly to store and insure. So experts say gold [silver] should be just a small slice of your portfolio. To avoid storage and insurance costs, invest in gold [silver] via precious metals mutual funds.<br>  <br>  [unquote]<br>  <br>  Good luck!

AA11756483	I would first ask the dealership I purchased the truck from for a referral to a reputable Hitch place. Try to remember if the job doesn't meet standards and the unfortunate should happen the warranty on your vehicle could be voided. The dealership may be able to arrange an appointment for you. Some shops will give you a discount if you are referred to them by your dealership. The hitch shops themselves can give you the low down on manufacturers.<br>  <br>  Raven Truck Accessories is a reputable shop - there are 2 of them in Calgary.<br>  <br>  Here are a few others you should check out - call them for a quote. For anyone here to give you the information would be useless because you did not mention the the type and what you are hauling, etc. Let the professionals handle this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/1/Trailer+Hitches/Calgary,+AB" rel="nofollow">http://www.yellowpages.ca/search/si/1/Tr...</a><br>  <br>  ps: I would not recommend Canadian Tire personally - some a shop that specializes in installing them, after all you spend a lot of money on the new truck, do you really want to chances with something so important?<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Ovgp8QxJaa	Canadian tire :)
