I've heard that it is better to have it up to prevent overheating, but will it really make THAT much of a difference?

20081112191736AAgO3dM	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox Live Survey (see details)?	How would you like to use a pay-as-you-play option for live?      Instead of a flat yearly fee, you will be charged slightly higher per minute than the yearly subscriptions. Basically it would be for people that only play maybe 5 hours per week and don't find paying $40/year reasonable.

20081113160458AAvpIEr	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	New Xbox 360 Dashboard?	In the new Xbox 360 dashboard you can install games to the system. However, to play the game, you need the game disc present in the system. If you need the game disk to play, what's the point of installing games. The only thing I know so far is that it "makes the graphics better." The thing I also know is that some games run "slower than normal." With all this being said, what's the point.      Thanks,             Jericho

The words "parental control" are greyed out when I select them and pressing buttons does nothing. Am I just doomed?

20090225141428AAFhRrl	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	XBox 360 Red ring of death?	My 360 got the RRoD about 2 weeks ago and I sent it in to Microsoft.  It just came back today and it works...so far.      While it was being repaired, I went out and bought a new 360 so I could play it while my other one was being fixed.        Now that it's back, I want to give my new 360 to my brother cause he can't afford one and I want him to have it - cause I'm cool like that.      The thing is, I'm concerned that my 360 will get the RRoD again.      So, my question is, one Microsoft fixes the problem and sends the 360 back, what's the chance it will happen again?  Once it's fixed, is it fixed for good, or is there a chance it'll get the RRoD again?
