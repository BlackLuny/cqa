20090202213745AAaV1tb	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	How do you find passion in life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.
20090202212702AAHM1U9	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Thanks guys for all your answers/points?	actually the scratch is quite broad and at some point deep too. we have very very compact space (for me at least!) in the apt parking lot and I scratched on the right side of the back door onto a pillar while taking the car out, I was in a hurry though that is not an excuse to be careless with the new car. there is even some kind of blue paint came from the pillar. dealers will probably charge me a lot of money, I was hoping if I could do anything cheaper!

20090202212420AAEAb2i	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	What will happen to my friend who didn't meant to use a fake ID?	My friends was caught outside of a bar last august. While outside of the bar he was holding a beer and he was already drunk. Before the cops came a random drunk guy gave him his ID. Once the cops arrested my friend for underage drinking, they took the first ID they found in his pocket, which was the the fake ID the random guy had given him, and used that information. That random guy came back and asked for his ID back. And obviously the cops figured it out that my friend had had a fake ID. If my friend wouldn't have been drunk, he would have given the police officers his legit ID. My friend has a court date on Friday to determine whether or not he will lose his license for a year. Do you think he will lose his license after he tells the court what really happened?
20090202212520AApHxua	Yahoo! Products;Other - Yahoo! Products	How do I cancel my Yahoo! Games/Oberon Media subscription after my 2-month obligation?	I made the mistake of subscribing to Yahoo! Games (1 game a month for $9.95 a month - with a 2 month minimum), thinking it was an actual Yahoo! premium service - only to find out that I ended up with a subscription to Oberon Media, and was billed by a company under an entirely different name "GAMESAVER SUBSCRIPTION INTERNET CY". I have been trying for 2 days now to find out how to cancel this subscription once my 2-month obligation has ended, but both, Yahoo and Oberon, have done nothing but give me a very aggravating  run around. HOW do I cancel this Yahoo! Games/Oberon Media subscription when the 2 months have elapsed and my 2-month obligation has been fulfilled????
