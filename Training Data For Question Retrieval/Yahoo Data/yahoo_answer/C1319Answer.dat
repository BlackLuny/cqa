Blood in the circulatory system carries nutrients and oxygen to the cells and organs and carries away waste products.  In addition, white blood cells in the circulatory system are also used to combat infections.  Without a functioning circulatory system, a human would not be alive.  So the nurse must know how the circulatory system functions and what relationship it has with other organs in order to maintain the circulatory system and thus preserve life.

This means it is remotely possible that all 11 trees receive the same treatment (if I've read the question correctly).  Therefore total number of arrangements   = 3*3*3* ... *3   = 3^11   = 177147    It would be a bit more complicated if it were decided to allocate, say, treatment A to 4 trees at random, treatment B to another 4, and treatment C to the remaining 3.  But that isn't the question!|`|EF3W3qjzaa	First off, I really doubt you have actually spent a few hours on one problem.    Now for the problem...  Number of ways to distribute 3 treatments among 11 trees = 11C3 = 11*10*9 / (3*2*1) = 165  This is the answer if the treatments are all the same.    If not...  Number of ways to change around the treatments in each arrangement = 6    165 * 6 = 990 different arrangements if the treatments are different.

TDlVhthjaa	28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14    Here's the trick to find perfect numbers....   You always start with 1, and you start adding doubling your last number added, until the result you get is a prime number.     So for example:  1, since the double of one is 2,  1+2 = 3     Then, you multiply your result by the last number you added.  3 x 2 = 6    So... We Go on.  the double of 2 is 4...   1+2+4=7   7 x 4 = 28!    How about the third?  the double of 4 is 8, however...  1+2+4+8 = 15   1+2+4+8+16 = 31     31 x 16 = 496|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	Your first two responders are right.  There is no formula for finding perfect numbers, it's just trial and error*.  And the next one is 28.    So far, no odd perfect number has ever been found, and no one has ever been able to prove that there aren't any.  Maybe you can work on it and become famous.    *That's not 100 per cent true.  It is known that all even perfect numbers can be found by using the following formula:    If (2^k) - 1 is a prime number, then [ 2^(k - 1) ] [ (2^k) - 1 ] will always be a perfect number.  But note that you have to check that (2^k) - 1 is prime first!    Note that you can get 6 by taking k = 2:  In that case (2^k) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3; and 2^(k - 1) = 2^1 = 2.  And 3*2 = 6.    You get 28 by taking k = 3.  In that case, (2^k) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7.  And 2^(k - 1) = 2^2 = 4.  And 7*4 = 28.    Unfortunately 2^4 - 1 = 15, which isn't prime.  But 2^5 - 1 = 31, so the formula gives us 31 times 2^(5-1) = 16, which is 496.  And the divisors of 496 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, and 248, which add up to 496.    Probably more than you wanted to know, but I think it's interesting.|`|3ltUmnYEaa	This is a trial and error problem, unfortunately.  There's no formula or 'mathematical' way to figure it out.

Basically, the belief is that the U.S. government, with the cooperation of the airlines, is putting some unknown chemical in jet fuel in order to spray it on the people below.    According to the believers, you can tell the difference between a normal contrail and a chemtrail by how long the trail remains in the sky. Supposedly, contrails go away quickly while chemtrails last a long time. This is nonsense of course, a contrail are simply clouds caused by a plane, and there is nothing unusual about a cloud sitting in the sky all day.    The guy in the video seems to think that 4 planes flying together (my guess is that it was 4 military aircraft) is somehow concrete evidence of the chemtrail conspiracy.

xFg8mQeCaa	Protecting Health from Climate Change   by me.   World Health Day (WHD) on 7th April marks the foundation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1948. This year, WHO has selected the theme Protecting health from climate change as it is posing an ever growing threat to global public health security.    According to the bulk of scientific opinion, the world is getting warmer. Most scientists are convinced that increasing concentrations of green warming house gases in the atmosphere are at least partly to blame for the global warming.    WHO estimated that climate change directly or indirectly contributes to about 77,000 deaths annually in Asia and the Pacific - about half of the world total attributed to climate change. Among the potential effects of global warming would be the appearance of mosquitoes where they were previously absent, with the accompanying threat of malaria and dengue fever. Some regions might be at risk of reduced rainfall, causing a shortage of fresh water and the resultant danger of water borne diseases. Millions of people could be at risk of malnutrition and hunger if arable land becomes unworkable. The increasing frequency of summer heat waves in temporate zones, e.g., Europe in 2003 and Asia in 2004 and typhoon, hurricanes and floods throughout the world are signs of changing weather and climate patterns.    In August 2003, Europe suffered its worst heat wave in recent memory. In France, temperature peaked at about 40oC. Unprepared for this kind of heat, many people  mostly the sick and elderly succumbed. In all, nearly 15,000 deaths in France that summer were attributed to the high temperatures; across Europe, the scorching weather may have claimed as many as 35,000 lives.    Developed countries share 15% of world population and 50% of carbondioxide emission. Temperature increase by 3-4o C would cause displacement of 330 million people due to floods, malaria infection for 220-400 million people due to flood, extinction of 20-30% of all the land species. Between 2000 and 2004, 262 million people were affected by natural calamities. Of these, 98% were in developing nations.     Issues for the Health Sector  Health hazards from climate change are diverse and global in nature. The hazards range from the risks of extreme weather events to changes in the dynamics of infectious diseases.     The health impact of climate change will be disproportionately greater in vulnerable populations which include the very young, elderly, medically infirm, poor and isolated populations. Climate-sensitive diseases such as diarrhoea, malaria and protein energy malnutrition already cause more than 3 million deaths globally. Even these numbers do not reflect the devastating indirect health impacts anticipated from the effect that climate change will have on food crops and the availability of fresh water in large areas of the world. According to the most recent projects of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global man temperature would increase by 1.4oC to 5.8oC between 1990 and 2100.     Climate Change and Human Health  Climate change is a significant and emerging threat to public health and changes the way we must look at protecting vulnerable populations. The IPCC confirmed that there is overwhelming evidence that humans are affecting the global climate and highlighted a wide range of implications for human health. Climate variability and changes cause death and disease through natural disasters, such as heat waves, floods and draughts. In addition, many important diseases are highly sensitive to changing temperatures and precipitation. These include common vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue; as well as other major killers such as malnutrition and diarrhoea. The impacts of climate on human health will not be evenly distributed around the world. Developing country populations, particularly in small islands, states, arid and high mountain zones and densely populated coastal areas, are considered to be particularly vulnerable.    Heat Waves and Cold Snaps  Perhaps the most obvious impact of global warming will be the direct effect - a warmer planet will experience more extreme heat waves. It is difficult to predict the future effect on mortality levels, because as heat waves become more frequent, we can expect societies to adjust  technologically, behaviourally and physiologically. Technological adaptations such as the installation of collective air conditioners and the construction of heat-minimizing houses will happen more quickly among the rich, so heat waves are likely to have a disproportionate effect in less-developed countries and in the poorer segments of rich countries.    Northern countries with severe winters have a high mortality rate in winter because more sick and elderly people succumb in cold weather and because blizzards and extreme cold create dangerous conditions in which accidental deaths are more likely.|`|Y1LTzXataa	Yes. Old people and small children are particularly susceptible to it and a lot of old people die when the weather heats up very quickly|`|39sUuRHVaa	Yes, It's due to your cells trying to keep homeostasis with the temperature outside.

AA10335036	Whether PV is constant goes back to the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. nR is always constant in a closed-volume situation, thus PV/T is constant.   So if T is held constant (isothermal process), PV is constant, which is what you are describing. This means that if the pressure triples, the volume is reduced to 1/3 its initial value. The plot will look like any y = 1/x plot except for scaling.  I don't understand "a linear pressure-volume relationship". Does this mean P/V = constant?

RgSCstkAaa	First, a matter of accuracy. Pressures may be measured in lbf/in^2, but never in lbf/in^3.    An inclined manometer gives great sensitivity, by providing a greater distance between individual markings. Divisions at 1'' spacings on a vertical tube, for example, become spacings of 1/sin(30 degrees) = 2'' on the tube inclined at 30 degrees. The inclination of the tube must, however, be to the exact specification or the accuracy suffers.     The early mercury barometer constructors sometimes used a vertical lower section of tubing with the upper portion inclined at an angle. For obvious reasons they were known as gallows barometers. They are pretty rare, but I have seen an actual example.
dZFwQPsGaa	One thing you have to assume, is that the hawk itself is not in free fall, so using the freefall calculations with the hawk (not the mouse) will not work.  The other thing, without air resistance, the mouse will still have the original horizontal velocity of the hawk.  When the hawk dives, it has to keep it's original horizontal velocity to catch the mouse.      a)  To figure the hawk's dive speed, you will need to know how fast it's getting to the mouse, which means you will have to figure out how long the mouse is in freefall.    the mouse falls from 250m to 3m  --247m.  Using the freefall equation,        h = h0 + vt + 1/2 gt^2 ==> -247 = 0 + 0 + 4.9 t^2.  solving for t, we find that t = 7.1s.      Now, the hawk has a 2s delay time, so the hawk has to dive 247m in 5.1 s.  Since the hawk is NOT in free fall--it controls it's speed, this is simply v/t ==> 247/5.1  ==>Vy=48.4 m/s (down).           We also have to take into account the 18.0 m/s of its horizontal speed.  Constructing a vector triangle, and using pythagorean's theorem, we find that V^2 = Vx^2 + Vy^2 or V=51.6m/s       b)  The angle can be figured using the vector triangle again.       tan @ = Vy/Vx  or 69.6 degrees below the horizontal.       c)  calculated from above, t=7.1s.  better luck next time mickey.
v2eAwuYkaa	It's genetic, but it isn't that you make one colour or another. Is just the amount of melanin you have. Melanin is the one also in charge of making skin and hair more or less dark. That's why normally people with blue ayes are also white and blond.  Also, it usually takes some time for melanin to be produced after being born. That's why babies are paler than parents and sometimes they are born with blue eyes and turn brown after a while.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It is their genes and is basically the same reason people have different colored skin.  Melanin is a pigment that protects people living near the tropics from too much sun.  That is the same pigment in brown eyes.  It is used to protect them from too much UV radiation.  In higher latitudes people don't need as much UV protection and some eyes lost much or all of the melanin.  That makes eyes look blue.  There are various combinations that account for all the different eye colors.      much more detailed explanation:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Eye color is determined by several genes.  There's one set of genes that "turns on" the color-manufacturing machinery (or does not).  If the machinery is not turned on, the eye color is blue or gray; if it is, the color may be brown or hazel, but the color produced is determined by another set of genes.

E8mMNm2aaa	It's a great choice if you're really interested in a tough career.    Outside of gas and oil it's very specialised and hence quite restricted. Engineering skills are secondary to Marine or Geographical qualifications in these sectors.    ROVs are not mass produced and it is therefore a limited market in terms of job oportunities.    If you are in the UK, you could try Oceaneering, Tritech Int'l or Seaeye Marine. In the states, your best bet would be Woods Hole Oceanagraphic Institute or possibly Shilling.    My advice would be to get started in the Oil or Gas industry and gain some skills there. Then take your skills elsewhere.    I was in that industry for a few years, it took me around the world and showed me things I will never forget.    If you are interested in ROVs, a dicipline in hydraulics or electronics would put you in good stead buddy.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Cellular respiration is primarily carried on by enzymes present in the cells.  pH can dramatically affect the activity of enzymes.  this is because they are long polymers of amino acids, and can gain or lose hydrogen ions.  (Remember that pH is related to the amount of hydrogen ions in a solution - low pH, acid solutions, have high levels of hydrogen, while low pH, alkali or basic solutions, have low levels of hydrogen).  Enzymes have pH optima (pHs at which they work the best); that for enzymes in the human body is often slightly basic (pH 7.2 to 7.4).  However, enzymes are different depending on their function.  For example, pepsin in the human stomach works best at an extremely acidic pH of about 2, because the stomach is very acidic.

F = mg*cos(17 deg)  Fcent = mv^2/r  So at minimum radius F = Fcent ==> r = v^2/(g*cos(17 deg)) (answer)  (remember v = 77/3.6 m/s)

RgSCstkAaa	At a simple level, if you stimulate a single neurone you get the same standard response. If, however, you stimulate a network of neurones, you may well find that there is a complex response which varies over time. Modulation is occurring at the interconnnections of the network and the body's response to a stimulus can be changed to a more or less appropriate one.

Assigning human feelings to inanimate objects is called "anthropomorphism" and is not particularly scientific.    But even if they were alive and thinking creatures, they would have no way to know what humans on Earth so far away have labelled them or what we think.  If they are thinking creatures, then perhaps Pluto feels superior to Neptune when Pluto is closer to the sun.    By the way, Pluto is now farther from the sun that Neptune - Pluto was closer to the sun between 1979 and 1999, but has again crossed Neptune's orbit.

The way I see it, "thinking" is a process like any other that goes on in the body. As such, chemical reactions occur before, during, and after the thought...obviously the synapses in your brain are going off every time you think something, just like they do for every other process. Basically information being relayed across neuron highways.  But to say that the very chemical reactions are all thoughts are just doesn't fit the bill...Think of the chemical reactions as the electricity that powers your thoughts.|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Electrochemical, to be precise. The nerve cells transmit signals in the form of electrochemical pulses called action potentials. They do it by regulating the concentration of Sodium and Potassium ions inside and outside the cell's membrane. This creates pulse-like waves of voltage that travel along the cell's membrane down to the next cell.|`|M9JcanLKaa	In reality everything that happens in cells is the result of a chemical reaction. Life is little more than natures chemistry set in action. Thoughts are stored as minute quantities of chemicals. Obviously this process is not the result of a conscious process, neither do we fully understand how it happens,but there is no other mechanism that can be used by the body to enable the processes that constitute life.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Stretch receptors in the stomach stimulate, in response to distension, cause endocrine cells in the stomach to release the hormone gastrin to the circulatory system.  Gastrin stimulates the parietal cells in the stomach to produce hydrochloric acid.  The HCl breaks down the inactive pepsinogen to the active form, pepsin (a protease -  enzyme that breaks down protein), so digestion of proteins begins.      Ingestion is the consumption of a substance by an organism, usually taken in through the mouth.  In the mouth, digestion begins - both mechanically (chewing by teeth) and chemically, because an amylase (enzyme that breaks down starch) is contained in the saliva.      Peristalsis is the organized waves of contraction of smooth muscle layers (alternately the circular muscle layers, then the longitudinal layers) along the digestive system.  It does not involve enzymes.      Digestion is the major process that involves enzymes, because it is the breaking down of food stuffs into the basic components.  Thus, proteases, amylases, lipases, etc. are produced and released, primarily to the small intestine.    Hydrolysis is the breaking down of molecules by the addition of water.    There are many enzymes that increase the speed of this reaction, including lactase, etc.      Elimination is the process of removing undigested or unused food from the body.  It does not involve enzymes.

trWFLo56aa	You don't. This is a reoccuring theme in books, movies, and TV, but it isn't real. The closest you can get to this would be applying pressure on the arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain, until the brain's blood supply is choked off long enough to render them unconscious -- but this is dangerous (it can cause brain damage or death) and very doubtful that the person you'd be trying to do this to would just sit still long enough for this to work (since this is definitely not instant "like you see in movies").    A closer interpretation of what you see in the movies is a blow to the back of the head that knocks someone out. This isn't a "pressure point" but actually striking hard enough to slosh your brain around in the skull; if enough stress is applied by the sloshing up against the sides of the skull, the person may lose consciousness. While this is possible, it generally is very unlikely to happen as neatly as you see in movies; most of the time, either the person yells OW and turns to hit you back, or you do permanent damage or possibly kill them. This is rarely useful to scriptwriters as it happens in reality (except as humor, when someone tries to pull off "what they always see in movies" and then it fails) so you get reoccuring theme of "hit them right and they keel over". Much like the also untrue "spaceships make neat noises in space" that scriptwriters have to comply with to satisfy audiences.
RgSCstkAaa	Parvolex is a specific treatment for paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, and has no other medical use. Paracetamol is normally broken down in several stages by the liver. In overdose, one of the breakdown products accumulates and causes liver damage. the accumulation is because another chemical which is needed for the further breakdown, glutathione, gets used up. Parvolex restores the glutathione concentrations and allows the liver to complete the breakdown of the paracetamol.|`|lLcpQCI5aa	No I Dont Know .

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	If both parents are brown eyed "hybrids" (by which I assume your teacher means heterozygous), they both have the genes Bb.  In order to do a Punnett square, you need to put all the possible gametes the mother can form on the top of a 4-squared box (2 by 2), and the father's gametes along the left side.  If they are heterozygous, each can produce either gametes with the B allele or the b allele.  Thus, their offspring have a 3:1 ratio.  The gametes with the B alleles from both parents could mix, producing a child homozygous for brown eyes (BB).  Two other possibilities would be if the B allele came from one parent, and the b from the other: both would be Bb, and have brown eyes.  (One BB and two Bb equals the 3 in the ratio that show the dominant trait).  The last of the four possibilities is that a gamete with the b allele from both parents could mix, producing a child homozygous for blue eyes (bb).      Take a look at the web site below for instructions on how to do a Punnett Square

Penguins have established hierarchy, in birds this typically referred to as a pecking order.  The further down the order the more submissive the penguin.  Nothing like friendship.  Penguins just plain don't get along all that well.      There are displays during mating.  These appear dance like and can easily been thought as friendly.  But there purpose is only to acquire a mate and reproduce.  Strictly biology.  Nothing romantic at all.    Here is an interesting site about penguin/animal behavior.  http://www.tuxxie.org/ethology/primer.ht...    Cartoons and these computer generated penguin fables made by Disney and others, are a biologist and ethologist nightmare.  They give animals human characteristic, anthropomorphism.

Yes, I'm sure many people "believe" that.    Anyone here believe...?  Very few, if any.  No scientists would believe that.    Is it possible?  Yes it is possible.  However, there would be some evidence.  For example, our DNA would show a marked difference with that of ALL other species (where the artificial "splicing" would have been done, for example).    I've read many stories where the premise is that humans were created through some intervention from the outside, including  some episodes of Star Trek, other science fiction, some fantasy (weaker science), the story of Nibiru and its inhabitants (extremely weak science) and the Bible (no science at all).

He is the one who came up with the Law of Parsimony which states that if you have more than one theory that explain the same event equally, then you should take the least numbers of unexplained steps -- or the ones with the smallest gaps.

b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	"<br>  CAPD is assessed through the use of special tests designed to assess the various auditory functions of the brain. However, before this type of testing begins, it is important that each person being tested receive a routine hearing test for reasons that will become obvious later.<br>  <br>  There are numerous auditory tests that the audiologist can use to assess central auditory function. These fall into two major categories: behavioral tests and electrophysiologic tests. The behavioral tests are often broken down into four subcategories, including monaural low-redundancy speech tests, dichotic speech tests, temporal patterning tests, and binaural interaction tests. It should be noted that children being assessed for CAPD will not necessarily be given a test from each of these categories. Rather the audiologist will select a battery of tests for each child. The selection of tests will depend upon a number of factors, including the age of the child, the specific auditory difficulties the child displays, the child's native language and cognitive status, and so forth. For the most part, children under the age of 7 years are not candidates for this type of diagnostic testing. In addition, central auditory processing assessments may not be appropriate for children with significant developmental delays (i.e., cognitive deficits)."

QJ5Lh3wUaa	A huge number of ideas have been suggested as possible causes for the dinosaur extinction. Some of the suggestions include:<br>  - asteroid impact,<br>  - volcano,<br>  - a supernova bathing the earth in radiation<br>  - mammals eating dinosaur eggs,<br>  - dinosaurs getting high from LSD-like chemicals in flowering plants (flowering plants evolved during the Cretaceous period towards the end of the era of the dinosaurs -- however they first appeared many millions of yeas before dinosaurs became extinct)<br>  - caterpillars eating dinosaur's food supplies<br>  - low sea levels allowing landbridges to form between continents, allowing dinosaurs to migrate and spread disease<br>  <br>  Here's the thing big extinction happened 65 million years ago. It didn't just kill the dinosaurs, it all killed lots of animals and plants too.<br>  <br>  There is a chart on this page of some animal groups: <a href="http://www.dinosaurjungle.com/dinosaur_facts_familytree.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dinosaurjungle.com/dinosaur_f...</a><br>  <br>  Notice how at the end of the Cretaceous period, Ammonites and Belemnites (things similar to squids that lived in the seas) suddenly stop 65 million years ago. Further down the chart so too do Mosasaurs (big reptiles that lived in the sea), Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs (more marine reptiles), Pterosaurs (flying reptiles), and of course, Dinosaurs.<br>  <br>  Also (but not shown on the chart) are other groups that were partially wiped out: like various plankton and plantlife, many types of birds, etc.<br>  <br>  So whatever explains the event, doesn't need to just explain dinosaurs, but all the other things that died out too. (To be fair some groups of dinosaurs, as well pterosaurs, and plesiosaurs seem to have already been in decline before the extinction occurred).<br>  <br>  The explanation also needs to allow for the fact that all these creatures had been very successful for a very long time, but then suddenly they disappeared. Something seems to have happened - something abnormal - and out of the blue - and all over the world - and effected all these types of animals and plants.<br>  <br>  A really big volcano or an asteroid hitting the earth are<br>  the most plausible explanations. As far as I know there is no evidence for the supernova theory (and there would be traces), and the other theories like mammals eating dinosaur eggs, or diseases, or caterpillars, don't explain why all sorts of animals or plants were affected, or why the event was sudden and largelyt out of the blue.<br>  <br>  So that leaves the volcano and asteroid theories (although of course it's possible one or more of the other things like disease could have weakened some groups before the volcano/asteroid)<br>  <br>  Either a volcano or asteroid would not only kill animals nearby to it, but would also have put lots of dust in the air for years, causing most plants around the world to die (no sunlight), and then animals too which didn't have enough food. Volcanos (or perhaps an asteroid) could also cause acid rain.<br>  <br>  Evidence for volcano - there was lots of volcanic at the right time in India<br>  <br>  Evidence for asteroid hitting earth - there is a crater in Mexico that looks like it could be the spot. There is a layer of iridium (a metal that usually ones comes from asteroids) in rocks around the whole world from the right age.<br>  <br>  It could of course be a combination of both causes.|`|AA11058044	Different species of dinosaur went extinct at different times.  Extinction is an ongoing process, and there were several groups - such as the stegosaurs, that never made it to the famous mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous.<br>  <br>  Current consensus is that there was a massive extra-terrestrial impact right about the same time that all of the living dinosaur species at the time went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous.<br>  <br>  This impact may very well have been the primary, or at least a primary cause of those particular extinctions.<br>  <br>  Other evidence indicates that it may not have been the only factor, however.  Potential diseases intermingling between populations newly migrating between Asia and North America may have weakened many species.  The rise of the new flowering plants may have outcompeted many of the non-flowering gymosperm species that the dinosaurs relied on for food.  An adaptive radiation of egg predating small nocturnal mammals may have provided additional stress.<br>  <br>  It's likely that it wasn't any one factor, but rather a combination of all of these, with the impact event being the figurative straw the broke the camel's back.|`|4c8ab139bf95dbc97c7afe8fa56e034daa	The big one is the change from Cretaceous period to the Triassic period.  The so-called K-T boundary is marked by a tremendous meteor impact in what is now the Yucatan peninsula. <br>  <br>  Worldwide, when we get to rocks about 65 million years old, we find a layer of iridium.  It is hypothesized that when the meteor hit, it liberated some deep earth and disintegrated, precipitating a fine layer world-wide.<br>  <br>  The world when through an estimated thousand years of sudden climate change, which killed off something like 80% of species.  <br>  <br>  Look up "Extinction Level Events"|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	If you listen to science they say a meteorite if you believe the bible it was the flood. During the flood there was a ice shield covering the earth and it blocked 95% of the dangerous sun rays and the earths atmosphere had double the oxygen content, in some samples of tree sap, like on Jurassic park where they got the DNA from a mosquito they found that the oxygen Level was 50% more than what it was today. So when the Ice shield over the earth broke and caused it to rain  we lost the protection on the sun and the oxygen dropped to where today it is now 18%, this also explains how the giant lizards where able to breath because the long necked dinosaurs would have set their nose on fire trying to get enough oxygen to breath to survive. So that's how most bible believers think it happened, now the scientists think it was a meteorite that hit the earth but would not explain why they were able to get so big and explain why we have oil, the flood explains where coal and oil come from the meteorite does not explain this.

eqEciY10aa	It seems that the rest of the answers aren't giving you enough information so I will help you. I own one so I know quite a lot about them. First off, have you owned any reptiles before? Horned lizards aren't the easiest lizards to care for. They aren't nocturnal bu require a heating source (no heat rocks,no heat pads under the cage but on the side because they bury themselves in the sand and they can burn themselves), and a UVB bulb because without it their metabolism doesn't function properly and their bones become weak. They are active as long as there is light. They require harvester ants to live but can survive on crickets (with a shortened life-span). They hunt by sitting still and waiting for prey to pass. Then when prey gets close, they take a few steps towards it and then eat it, repeating until they are full. Ants are expensive and hard to contain(20 dollars for 500 ants and they eat about 50 a day with crickets nearby). They require sand or i use finely crushed walnut shells. They also need to be sprayed with water 4 times a week because they do not drink water from a dish and if they aren't sprayed enough they will dehydrate quickly. Overall, if you have no experience with reptiles, i don't recommend getting one.|`|b8QUR7Qzaa	they are active and hunt during the morning or late afternoon   at night they Burrow in the soil   they hunt by standing on the edge of an ant hill and they flick there  sticky tongue to catch them   they also scitter to catch smaller insects   it also depends on what type of horny toad it is|`|yI5RgBu8aa	Well I don't think they're nocturnal, but the may handle being out and about in both night and day.

What I am trying to say is that, as V1 or the volume increased, P2 has to increase to keep the same standard temperature. Because remember pressure in reality are the tiny molecules crashed against the walls of the container, so as there is more space, there is less pressure. When there is a greater pressure, there is a smaller volume, of course under ideal conditions.<br>  <br>  "as pressure increases, there are more collisions per unit time and this causes an increase in volume as the particles are moving around and competing for more space. so as pressure increases, so does volume :)" she is absolutely wrong, so do not listen to her... if pressure increases, volume decreases under ideal conditions because boyles law states that pressure and volume are INVERSELY proportional.

The changes that allow for this to happen are very subtle, so the process is very gradual and it takes a long long time.|`|4HoVVCenaa	Organisms change over time due to mutations. Those mutations that increase survivability are passed on to the off spring. Over millions of years, this increased diversity. Darwin first proposed this theory. The fossil record supports it with a huge amount of data, which shows that more complex animals are more recent in historical time than simpler animals which first appeared early. There are a lot of "dead ends" in the record also, so not all adaptations were successful. Add this to changing environment and evolution is necessary for long term survivability. .|`|hRNpGnktaa	Evolution is the process where an organism become adapted to it surrounding. This is called Natural Selection, The survival of the fittest! The fittest survive because they are more adapted to their surroundings and are more likely to survive. This happens because the survivor has an advantage over its descendants, and because of this advantage i.e bigger feet, stronger teeth - its survives and mates. By mating, its passes on these genes to its children who in turn will survive, with this new ability. And so it carries on, slowly adding new abilities, changing how the animal looks etc. Like apes evolved into humans. This is because the most intelligent apes survived. And slowly became more and more intelligent as intelligence helped them survive. And then we have what we have today. Us!

7TQ5qGWcaa	because they have to have room to carry their young  Birds are always bigger than the male|`|ku2tP4eEaa	It is not that the females are larger, more like the males are smaller.  When it comes to reproduction the only real value of a male is to produce sperm and pass on his genes.  No animal needs a lot of body mass to do that.  Generally larger male animals, as in mammals, provide more than sperm.  Like in lions, where the males protect the pride.    One of the most obvious in the ruby-throated hummingbird.  The males are noticeably smaller than the females.  Males are also submissive to females.  Males mate only when a female is ready and picks one.  Females need to be large enough to produce eggs, give birth, and raise young.  Each species has evolved reproductive strategies for successful survival.  That includes the sexual size variation.|`|9d3XJecAaa	Because the chromosone that codes for them to be a male (Y) in humans, contains a gene that makes them (usually) larger... justlike in humans... males are usually bigger (taller) then females|`|sTKJkvFsaa	Cuz the girlies make the babies.|`|gLxEoauxaa	Male are smaller because they need to be swift to fight off predators.

It's just to their advance. For the human species the male seems to protect the female and the babies, but this is not the case for many animals where the male leaves after the sexual intercourse^^...  Heard that happens to some human females too...  So they have to protect the babies themselves.  Of course there are a lot more specific reasons for different animals.  For the birds you mentioned they have to hunt to feed their children becourse of a lack of a male. As there is no protecting father it has to be substituted.

It has negative side effects, and also, I might add, taking Rilatin if you do not have ADD is illegal...  If you do have ADD, it's fine though.  Plenty of people manage to get Rilatin legitimately through doctors even though they do not have ADD, through false answers to tests given by doctors, but keep in mind that it is not side-effect free - it's not good for your body.
TaP5CeTnaa	Bulls are color blind so its not the red its the swishing motion of the cloth.

They charge because of the movement of the cape.    In Spain, a Matador will don his "Montera" (small black hat), bow to the Presidents Box, and then dedicate the bull to a spectator in the stands.    The Matador will start the fight with a series of passes, first from side to side to bring the bull close to his body, then high with the cape traveling directly over the bull's horns. After the bull is trained to charge the cape and it has reduced its area of protection to just a few feet, a Matador will show you his individual personality by the combination and variations on these passes. Some of the better Matadors in Spain will fight the bull from their knees or even kneel with their backs exposed to the bull.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	it because of the motion not the color heres a link    http://www.coolquiz.com/trivia/explain/d...|`|e3c2ed462851c4c6d6796055b93e6970aa	They don't charge at any specific color.

ECC68ldNaa	simply because of different genes that has been crossed giving this diversity.  genes are composed of two parts,one that come from the mother n the other comes from the father,and they are of two types,they are either recessive or dominant.  recessive genes only occur when pure,meaning that the same identical genes come from both parents and leads to you having blond hair for instance(since blond hair is actually a recessive gene).  you can also have a grandparent with some recessive trait which led to your brother having red hair (that gene is also recessive,therefore it has to be pure)  while dominant genes could either be pure or impure,meaning they show up anyway whether pure or impure,hence,the name dominant.That is why some of your brothers have brown eyes since your father also have them(they are dominant and they don't have to be pure,meaning that your mother gives the blue eye gene and your father gives the brown eye gene and since your father's gene is dominant,it prevails and shows)    So this variation between your siblings and you is basically dependant on the fact of the gene variety of your parents ,grand parents,and basically your entire family tree.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Because of DNA.

m3T8IMwhaa	I don't recall the term "one-to-one" but am guessing the likely, that for each x there is one y and for each y there is one x.  You could just say for each x there is only one y and call it one-to-one, but as I said, I'll assume my first definition.    A, C, D are one-to-one.  B is parabolic, so for each y that exists, except the vertex, there are two x values possible.  E is symmetrical about y-axis, so f(x) = f(-x)  F is an ellipse, if I remember correctly so each defined x has two y values and each defined y has two x values.    If the second is your definition, only F would fail.  So check the definition and good luck.

m0dv0ANpaa	cell structure refers to what a cell has in it to help it perform its functions. for e.g a  muscle cell could have a lot of mitochodrion; the source of aerobic respiration ie it released energy. this is because a muscle cell contracts a lot and muscle contractions require a lot of enery. cell structures or not just the shape of the cells but also what organells it has in it :)

wdBm2lDYaa	Electrical power is consumed only if there is a path for the current to flow.      Power is considered to be energy which is Volts (electrical pressure) times Amps (current flow rate).  Without a bulb in the socket the electrical pressure is present (can be measured with a meter) but current is not flowing (0 Amps) so power is also Zero.    Simplified version - No.  Reason - the bulb out of the socket is the same is every wall outlet with nothing plugged into it.  (Just 2 metal terminals - one side electrically hot and the other side is return ground.)|`|4U9DH6KGaa	no.    The live power has to return via the gas or the filament back to neutral to be 'using' power.  The power just sits at the lamp holder waiting.    ... and it's a lamp, not a bulb.  You put a bulb in the ground!
FtaSznSQaa	If there is no bulb in the socket, there is no current flowing, so no power is being consumed.    The socket will have some very (VERY!) small capacitance, so there could be some current flow, but since its capacitive, the current and voltage are out of phase, which does not contribute to the consumption of "power".  Way down in the minutia, no capacitance is quite perfect, so some minuscule amount of power could be consumed by the alternating polarization of the dielectric materials that make up these very small capacitances.    Technically, Dagger is correct, there would also be some extremely small "leakage" current due to the non-zero conductivity of the insulators that are used to make the socket.  These could be resistive, consuming microscopic amounts of "power", but zero for most practical purposes.|`|GMrtEYj6aa	yes.|`|sfC6L8ybaa	No.  Were you expecting strange answers?|`|N0UUmjDlaa	Only if you then stick your finger in the socket!|`|AA11061397	No.|`|UQWTXx9haa	There is a common misunderstanding that when the lights are off then no electricity is used.

With no bulb, means R(resistance) between positive and negative electricity poles is unlimited. When R is unlimited, no I(current) could flow through it, or I=0. Apply this to formula P=VxI where P:Electric Power , V:Voltage , I:Current ----> P=0 . Electricity usage unit is KWh. if P=0 so KWh=0.  Thank you very much R Coolwhip.|`|it2UVkF4aa	Yes, however, as long as the socket plug is in an outlet then there's current being used (even without a bulb in the socket). The notion is the turn-on switch that is use to power the socket is still excepting current that is already flowing to other electrical devices. Only when you turn off the switch that's powering the socket, there will not be no current flowing to the socket.|`|asX2hxFXaa	It's been shown that a small amount of electricity "leaks" ... so technically yes.

F6IOLf3Aaa	It is a very good question that there simply no scientific based data to even consider an answer.  One could look at human twin studies along these same lines and the results, as I recall, showed similarity in IQ, personality, temperament styles, and inherent tendencys. However, because human twins and true human clones are not the same thing (significant differences in embryogenesis) a parallel conclusion cannot be certain.    As far as anyone knows, no human clones have been produced. As a result, there's no science based data to describe just what a human clone would be like.  That is one of the very reasons we should be considering cloning human beings.  We don't know anything for certain about it. By shutting the door to that science, we have no idea what range of information about human nature, human psychology, human consciousness, human relationships, etc., are being lost.    In all likelihood, true human cloning is not at all what people have been led to believe by agencies with their own hidden agendas.  There's indirect evidence based upon human twin studies and aspects of quantum physics which suggest that human cloning may be the one best avenue for extending the useful human life span significantly. If so, the people deserve to have the facts.   There's nothing more unethical about human cloning than with in vitro fertilization, and in vitro is alive and well, why?  Something the government and the church don't want you to know and something the government and the church don't want to deal with -- the truth, maybe.    As far Einstein's brain: it has been pickled for many years and its DNA is useless at this point.

fUDlbOP0aa	yes there is. if you had a microphone or a large speaker, and a oscilloscope you can measure sound by how much energy it creates in the microphone or speaker.     A speaker creates sound by making air move (sound waves). this works backwards also, but not as efficiently. so if you measured the voltage or current output of 5 or so known levels of noise- like you had a computer play a sound clip 5 times at varying volumes, you can establish a crude scale.     Now a gunshot will have one major spike and then several smaller ones after it. you can either record video (high frame rate) or the scope's readings to determine the decibels of the gunshot, or have some of those scopes that will take screen shots when the voltage is at its highest.     you should be aware the the environment used in testing will play a role in how loud gunfire is. same gun, two different environments: in a small room and out on the plains- the felt or heard noise to the ear drums is very different. indoors or confined areas (even if its a place big as a blimp hangar) will amplify and contain the noise. it may reverberate off the walls, further amplifying it. A open area without anything to reflect sound in sight will make what was ear-shattering indoors seem quite outdoors.     now some approximate figures to establish a scale:  50db: quiet conversation  70db: loud conversation  90db: inside a rowdy bar  110db: subways screeching past you  120 db: next to a jackhammer  125 db: your ear drums hurt from the noise  135 db: your ears will ring from the noise  155 db: temp loss of hearing  180 db: jet engine winding up for takeoff/chance of permanent hearing loss  195 db: blood may trickle from the ears.   210 db: a bomb going off or rocket engine at close rang (instant and complete forever loss of hearing). blood will come out of the ears, as well as some other liquid. you will also lose your balance.     Now for gunshots:  subsonic:  CCI CB .22long out of a 22" bbl rifle: approx 70 db at 3 feet indoors  Remington Subsonic .22LR out of a 22" bbl rifle: approx 100 db indoors at 3 feet  regular ammo:  .22LR Federal high velocity, fired outdoors in a very open area: 85 db  7.62x39mm from a SKS carbine fired in the desert: approx 120 db (extremely loud)  20 gauge shotshell (1260 fps 7.5  birdshot) fired from a pump action 19" bbl shotgun outdoors: 125 db (pain in the ears)  7.62x54mmR from a Russian M91/30 rifle, very wide open area: approx 150 db, ringing and pain in the ears, slight loss in hearing.

ecyYwLngaa	First of all, the total sample space is 1000+3000+800=4800    So for area 1, 1000/4800= 20.83% of the total sample space in area 1  For area 2, 3000/4800= 62.5% of the total sample space in area 2  For area 3, 800/4800=16.67% of the total sample space in area 3    Now to find the weighted mean, we multiply the percentage liked in each area by the % of the sample space that the area contains and add them all up.    So the mean = (.2083)(.40) + (.625)(.30) +(.1667)(.50)                      = .083 +  .1875 + .083                     = .3542 or 35.42 %    Hope that helps! Good luck! :-)

AA12351398	Divide out the denominator x. Work the equation first and you will find that it is actually linear or X + 1    f(x) = (x^2 + x) / x   = x^2 / x + x/x  = x + 1    The equation you are actually plotting is f(x) = X + 1    The significance of the graph is it is telling you something about the equation you may not notice right away, such as what happened here.  It is good to readdress the equation analytically and see what is actually going on.      The equation appears to be linear is what you should say. It will plot continuous at any interval. Even at zero. y or f(x) has a discrete value at x = 0 and x has a discrete value at y = 0. This is not a discontinuous equation and the guy below is smoking crack.|`|AA11508270	f(x) = (x^2 + x)/x    If you were to graph this on a graphing calculator, f(x) will be seen as: (x^2)/x + x/x = x + 1    So f(x) would appear to be continuous on the interval : [-4, 4], but in reality it's not continuous at x = 0; it has a removable discontinuity at that point.  I don't know if you've encountered this before, but you would say that (x^2 + x)/x, and x + 1, have the same limit at x = 0, namely 1.      If you graphed this function, without first analyzing it, one could think that this function is continuous at x = 0, when it's not. Graphing a function on a calculator can make you lose important information about the function you're graphing.     For example, the function : f(x) = ln(x), is not continuous at x = 0, but if you graphed it in a calculator, it will not totally be apparent.

cb36d71046b7619f8bf36c9cf3890c61aa	First, you need to find common denominators for each half of the equation.  Once you have both sides of the equation expressed as one fraction, then cross multiply the fractions.  Simplify, and set equation equal to 0.        QUESTION 1:  I am not sure where you mean to put parenthesis... The first is how you wrote it, but I think you meant the second version.    x/3 = 4/x + 1  x/3 = 4/x + x/x  x/3 = (4 + x)/x  x*x = 3*(4+x)  x^2 = 12 + 3x  x^2 - 3x - 12 = 0  x = [-b + SQRT(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a   and   [-b - SQRT(b^2 - 4ac)]/2a     x = [3 + SQRT(57)]/2    and    [3 - SQRT(57)]/2    x/3 = 4/(x + 1).... already one fraction each side... so, cross multiply  x^2 + x = 12  x^2 + x - 12 = 0  (x + 4)(x - 3) = 0  x + 4 = 0    or    x - 3 = 0  x = -4   or   x = 3        QUESTION 2:  5/(y - 3) = (y + 7)/(2y - 6) + 1   ..... find common denominator on right  5/(y - 3) = (y + 7)/(2y - 6) + (2y - 6)/(2y - 6)  .......  Simplify  5/(y - 3) = (y + 7 + 2y - 6)/(2y - 6)  5/(y - 3) = (3y + 1)/(2y - 6)  ......  Now, Cross-Multiply  5*(2y - 6) = (y - 3) * (3y + 1)  .....  Use FOIL on the right side  10y - 30 = 3y^2 + y - 9y - 3  10y - 30 = 3y^2 - 8y - 3   .... set equal to 0  0 = 3y^2 - 8y - 3 - 10y + 30  0 = 3y^2 - 18y + 27  3y^2 - 18y + 27 = 0  (3y - 9 )(y - 3) = 0  3y - 9 = 0   or    y - 3 = 0  3y = 9   or    y = 3  y = 3   or   y = 3  y = 3    if you do not see how to factor in your head, remember you can always use the formula   x = [-b + SQRT(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a   and   x = [-b - SQRT(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a
6uoseXfqaa	The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale, so each "step" in magnitude is equal to a TEN-FOLD increase in energy. This means that a magnitude 4 earthquake is 10 times more powerful than a magnitude 3, and a magnitude 5 earthquake is 100 times more powerful than a 3, and a magnitude 6 is 1000 times more powerful... and so on.    Earthquake energies vary a great deal, and using a logarithmic scale is just a "cleaner" way of classifying them. It's a lot simpler to use a 1-10 scale than a 1 - 10,000,000,000 scale.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	It means that each number is a multiple of the one below it instead of a simple step up.   Thus a 5 might be 10 times as strong as a 4.  I would have to look, but I think the common earthquake scale is a square root log - instead of 10 times as big, the next is the square root of 10 - 3.16 times as big.    This kind of scale is common in human factors - when we judge a sound as being twice as loud, as in bels and decibels it actually has a much larger amount of energy, not twice as much.|`|asX2hxFXaa	An example of a linear scale would be your car's speedometer:  50 mph is 10mph more than 40 and so on.

If earthquakes are measured by the amplitude of the vibration they create (I made that up.  I don't know if it's energy or what, but go with me) and they measure in millimeters, a cm would be a 1, a meter would be a 3, etc.  pH is the negative log of the concentration of hydrogen ion concentration so that's a log scale and I think sound in decibels is a log scale.  Anyway, it means that a 2 is 10 times worse than a 1, not twice as bad.|`|AA6Aq94vaa	The Richter Scale (the scale used for earthquakes) is logarhythmic because each whole number is 10 times the previous number.  For example an earthquake that measures 4.0 on the Richter scale is 10 times as powerful as a 3.0    Also each "point" on the richter scale is twice as powerful as the one before it.  For example: an earthquake that measures 5.3 is twice as powerful as a 5.2.  And two "points" difference on the Richter Scale is 3 times as powerful as two points before it and so on. A 5.7 is 3 times as powerful as a 5.5 and four times as powerful as a 5.4    A logarhithmic scale is used instead of a linear scale because it is easier to use in the long run

zYQFpJWNaa	It is indeed an odd phenomenon. It is called super-cooling: water has the capacity to remain a liquid even when it is very cold. I think that if it gets to something near to -42 C it MUST freeze, but until then it is possible for it to remain a liquid. (Ice, on the other hand cannot exist above 0 degrees Centigrade.    The 'trick' is that, as strange as it seems, water needs a certain amount of energy to form its first ice crystal, and if the water cools quite slowly, by the time it gets to freezing, there is not the 'extra' energy available. More commonly, as water freezes more quickly, there will be warmer water around, and that will source this tiny energy boost it needs to start solidifying.     Once the crystalization process begins, it gallops, and so once triggered, a super-cooled liquid will freeze in a few seconds.       Once the water is supercooled, it needs energy for the freezing process to begin, but this energy can come in many ways. A shot of kinetic energy is sufficient: like bumping the bottle, or opening a bottle of carbonated liquid: the removal of the top causes a sudden change in pressure as pressure is released, and that too is enough.

We have 300 choice on first pick, 299 on second pick, and 298 on third pick.  The number of ways to pick three people is: 300*299*298      2.)  Now, to calculate how we can pick just one female.  There are 80 females in total, so we have:    80 choice for a female, 220 for the first male, and 219 for the second male.  I didn't specify any order, but remember that it can be female first, male second, male 3rd, or male first, female second, male third, or male first, male second, male third.  Hence we have: 3*(80*220*219) ways to pick one female.    The probability of picking one female is: [3(80*220*219)]/[(300*299*298)] ~= 0.432583
GT0hOEGhaa	The increase temperature is an increase in the movement of the particles of the solvent. This movement allows the bonds of the particles of the solute to break faster.     Is just the fact that more collisions happen between the molecules as you increase the temperature. :)    BTW: In another subject: heating the solvent won't always allow more solute to be diluted. In fact if the solute is a gas the colder the solvent is the more solute the solvent will tolerate.

No amount of chemical experimentation will change that.    The Earth is the center of the universe.    The sound barrier can not be broken.    Powered flight is nothing more than an expensive hobby, and will amount to nothing useful.    We live in a golden age! Everything that exists to be discovered has already been discovered.    We can not go to the moon. It is too far, and technology is not sufficient enough.    The laws of physics do not allow us to send spacecraft to other planets.    Computers are fast enough, there is no need nor any desire to make them faster.    To all you nay-sayers, I am sorry, but you will be wrong. Time travel is  just a complicated problem that will take a long time to decipher, but will eventually be figured out. Humans will probably drive each other to extinction before that point (thus why no time travelers have met us yet) but it is by no means impossible.|`|zQiwHJV6aa	Theoretically you can, practically I doubt it.|`|hO7g5Y9taa	Ok, here goes the time travel theory.

Humanity is required to have Intel super computing chips grafted into their brains, No person is stupid on the entire earth. Everyone is devoted to advanced science and technology. Ok, now,  Einstein's theory states that time slows or stops when you approach the speed of light. You get in your ship and go on a round trip. You travel in orbit around the sun for hundreds of years... life goes on for the people of earth. In your ship because you were traveling at light speed, you have only been gone for a few minutes.

You can't travel to the past because the past no longer exists, and you can't travel to the future because the future doesn't exist yet.

If it was meant to happen, it would have already.    Traveling through time to the future is almost definitely as preposterous.. Since every event in the future-history of the universe would have to be meticulously planned out as well, and one would have to bring into account things like Destiny, Grandfather Paradoxes, Alternate Universes and such.

If you look for them long enough, you'll see them...|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	Kenneth Arnold was is see did 1947 in.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	It is mostly imagination.  Remember, UFO is something unidentified.  "Gee, I saw something in the sky and I haven't a clue as to what it was." doesn't translate to "alien being."    The whole question of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe comes down to two questions:    1. How difficult is it for life to come into existence out of non-life.  2. How unique is the Earth's environment and its environmental history in the universe and how necessary was that environmental history to the development of intelligent life (man).    The first question addresses whether, given the right environment, would it be likely that life would start up anywhere?  We suspect that the answer to that question is: Very Likely.  The reason is that the more we look around the universe the more precursors to life we find.  The more we look around the Earth the more we find evidence that life on earth happened very soon after the Earth was created (geologically speaking).  The question of life elsewhere in our solar system is probably the most important question that all of our space exploration is aimed at answering.  We have not found any slam-dunk evidence for life elsewhere but we continue to find places where it could have developed and we continue to look.    The second question addresses the nurturing of primitive life into complex organisms.  On Earth (our only example of life we currently have) it took over 3.5 billion years to come up with man; three and a half billion years where the environment on the Earth was relatively stable.  For about 3 billion of those years life was mostly single celled.  During this immense time period the environment on Earth was favorable to the continued development of life even in the face of a drastically changing solar environment.  Is it likely that such a planet would exist elsewhere in the universe?  The numbers of stars are staggering so it might seem a virtual certainty that there are Earth-like Planets elsewhere in the universe.   Consider this: the Earth has developed life and as far as we currently know Mars and Venus have not.  They are Earth-like planets - very similar planets to the Earth.  The answer must be more complicated than just Earth-like planets.    Another thing to consider: our sun, Sol, has over the last 4 billion years increased its output by about 25% due to normal stellar evolution.  That is an enormous change in output and without some compensating factor the Earth, over that time period, would have gone from an ice ball to a barren Venus like planet.  It didn't- but we don't know what the factor or factors were that maintained such a constant environment.    Now consider the likelihood of the Earth receiving visits from aliens.  The chances of alien life forms visiting us come down to three additional questions.  One addresses the spatial problem and one the temporal problem.  The third addresses actual travel possibilities.    1.If a technologically sophisticated life form did develop elsewhere in the universe would it be likely that they would be contemporaneous with man when he is also technologically sophisticated.   2.Is it likely that a technologically sophisticated life form could develop near enough to us so that they could reasonably visit the Earth?  3.Does there really exist a new physics that would allow travel over immense distances in reasonable times?    When alien extraterrestrial life is considered what we usually referred to is: technologically sophisticated life.  We arent usually talking about bacteria or worms or even Homo Erectus visiting the Earth.  Humans have been technologically sophisticated for only about 100 years with radio communications and rockets. Our first satellite to orbit another body was only 42 years ago. That is 100 years out of a total history for the Solar System of 4,500,000,000 years and of 13,500,000,000 years for the universe.  The chances of a second life form becoming technologically sophisticated and also overlapping in time with man- also being technologically sophisticated seem vanishing small.  Alien civilizations may have come into being, developed and become extinct hundreds of millions of years before or after Earths man became technologically sophisticated.    The problem of travel is also daunting.  With all of our present sophistication we do not have the ability to travel to even the nearest star.  The development of super-sophisticated intelligent extraterrestrial life capable of traveling to nearby stars would first require a nurturing environment existing for billions of years and then the development of science and technology far beyond ours. Put all together that in itself is very, very, very unlikely.  For intelligent life to happen a second time NEAR enough to our star, Sol, so travel would be possible is vanishingly unlikely.  In talking about alien visitors to Earth there is an implied uncovering of a new physics that would allow what our present physics does not allow- travel over large distances in reasonable time frames.  It may be that that physics does not exist.  If you indulge in new physics then you are opening yourself up to creating a fantasy world that may not exist in reality    Man presently might have the technology and ability to send a man to Neptune.  At the speed of 50,000 miles per hour we would need to provide life support to the astronauts for several years.  It would take 6.4 years at 50,000 mph to go to Neptune  one way.  Now consider the NEAREST star.  At a speed of 1,000,000 miles per hour it would take 2,885 years just to get there AND that is only to the nearest star!    Unless there really is a new physics unknown to man there is essentially no way for aliens to visit the Earth.  If you accept physics as we know it- then there are too few nearby stars for there to be a high probability for the development of technologicall|`|dhJbBVjyaa	UFO is an Unidentified Flying Object.

17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The carbon cycle isn't part of astronomy; try asking about it in the Biology category.    The Moon is a sphere which travels once around the Earth every 29 days. As it does so, it is illuminated from varying angles by the Sun. At New Moon, the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, so that the side of the Moon facing towards us receives no direct sunlight, and is only lit by dim sunlight reflected from the Earth. As it moves around the Earth, the side we can see gradually becomes more illuminated by direct sunlight.    After a week, the Moon is 90 away from the Sun in the sky and is half illuminated, what we call First Quarter because it is about a quarter of the way around the Earth.     A week after this, the Moon is 180 away from the Sun, so that Sun, Earth and Moon form a line. The Moon is fully illuminated by the Sun, so this is called Full Moon. The Earth's shadow points towards the Moon at this time, but usually the Moon passes above or below the shadow and no eclipse occurs.    A week later the Moon has moved another quarter of the way around the Earth, to the Third Quarter position. The Sun's light is now shining on the other half of the visible face of the Moon.    Finally, a week later, the Moon is back to its New Moon starting position. Usually it passes above or below the Sun, but occasionally it passes right in front of the Sun, and we get an eclipse of the Sun.    The Moon's phases are NOT caused by the shadow of the Earth falling on the Moon. In fact the shadow of the Earth only falls on the Moon twice a year when there is a lunar eclipse.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	You do realize the carbon cycle and the phases of the moon aren't related to each other, don't you?

eAi1vyapaa	its black but because of the light and the distance away it looks blue lol|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	The sky is not blue, it only appears blue.  The sky is clear and transparent - just like it is at night when the moon and stars shine through it without being altered in their color.  The blue sky color is an optical illusion - just like a rainbow.    A rainbow isn't a real object although the colors you see are real.  You can make a rainbow with a garden hose and a sprinkler head and the Sun.  The rainbow looks like it is real and really there but when you turn the water off the rainbow goes away.      The reason the rainbow has colors is because the light going into a rain drop is refracted and then is totally internally reflected and then is refracted as it exits the drop.  The angle of refraction of the light is color dependent.  That produces the rainbow's colors.  Notice that the rainbow always appears opposite the Sun.  The Sun has to be at your back.    In a similar way the blue color of the sky is created all over the sky and it looks like there is a real blue sky but it goes away when the sun goes down.  The object we call the blue sky is an optical illusion.    The blue sky color is created when sunlight shines through the Earth's atmosphere during the day.  The atmosphere is mostly composed of oxygen, argon and nitrogen gasses.  As sunlight shines through the atmospheric gasses some of the light is scattered in all directions by the very molecules of the gasses.  This scattering process, called Raleigh Scattering is very wavelength dependent.  Blue light is scattered in all directions about 10 times as much as red light is scattered and so we see mostly blue light coming from the direction of the sky.    The blue sky is light scattered from the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere The rainbow is created by refraction of light within a rain drop.|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	the bluer the sky signifies how clear the air is|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	because i was told that it reflects the sea  as there is 3/4 of sea and the rest land|`|HKNbWjtOaa	global warming!|`|2lQ8DJAcaa	The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.     However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.     As the sun begins to set, the light must travel farther through the atmosphere before it gets to you. More of the light is reflected and scattered. As less reaches you directly, the sun appears less bright. The color of the sun itself appears to change, first to orange and then to red. This is because even more of the short wavelength blues and greens are now scattered. Only the longer wavelengths are left in the direct beam that reaches your eyes.    http://www.sciencemadesimple.com/sky_blu|`|SMvTq4fZaa	The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering.

Lets take it in steps.    Step 1:  Sunlight isn't actually white light, it is all colours of the rainbow (from indigo to blue to green to yellow, orange, and red).  Each colour is a different wavelength, and each wavelength is bent (refracted) by a different amount when the light goes from one medium (such as air) into another (such as glass or water).  It bends one way when it enters the glass or water and bends back the same amount when it exits back into the air.    Step 2:  If the exit boundary is angled to the entry boundary (as in a glass prism or raindrop), then the light bends more in the same direction when it exits.  We then see a rainbow in the sky, or a rainbow on the wall if there is a crystal in sunlight somewhere.    Step 3:  The blue wavelengths of light are just the right size to be refracted (bent) by the molecules of our atmosphere.  The air refracts the light entering the molecules and again when it exits.  So this blue light is scattered all through the sky, colouring it blue.  And that's why sunlight looks yellow to us - when blue light is removed from white sunlight, it has an excess of the yellow'/orange wavelengths and we see yellow sunlight.    Step 4:  At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through a lot more atmosphere than any other time, so more of the blue light gets scattered and absorbed by the atmosphere, leaving only red and orange (and some yellow) left to reach our eyes.|`|Tdkuuhqhaa	this should help   On a clear sunny day, the sky above us looks bright blue. In the evening, the sunset puts on a brilliant show of reds, pinks and oranges. Why is the sky blue? What makes the sunset red?    To answer these questions, we must learn about light, and the Earth's atmosphere.        THE ATMOSPHERE  The atmosphere is the mixture of gas molecules and other materials surrounding the earth. It is made mostly of the gases nitrogen (78%), and oxygen (21%). Argon gas and water (in the form of vapor, droplets and ice crystals) are the next most common things. There are also small amounts of other gases, plus many small solid particles, like dust, soot and ashes, pollen, and salt from the oceans.    The composition of the atmosphere varies, depending on your location, the weather, and many other things. There may be more water in the air after a rainstorm, or near the ocean. Volcanoes can put large amounts of dust particles high into the atmosphere. Pollution can add different gases or dust and soot.    The atmosphere is densest (thickest) at the bottom, near the Earth. It gradually thins out as you go higher and higher up. There is no sharp break between the atmosphere and space.        LIGHT WAVES  Light is a kind of energy that radiates, or travels, in waves. Many different kinds of energy travel in waves. For example, sound is a wave of vibrating air. Light is a wave of vibrating electric and magnetic fields. It is one small part of a larger range of vibrating electromagnetic fields. This range is called the electromagnetic spectrum.    Electromagnetic waves travel through space at 299,792 km/sec (186,282 miles/sec). This is called the speed of light.              The energy of the radiation depends on its wavelength and frequency. Wavelength is the distance between the tops (crests) of the waves. Frequency is the number of waves that pass by each second. The longer the wavelength of the light, the lower the frequency, and the less energy it contains.        COLORS OF LIGHT  Visible light is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum that our eyes can see. Light from the sun or a light bulb may look white, but it is actually a combination of many colors. We can see the different colors of the spectrum by splitting the light with a prism. The spectrum is also visible when you see a rainbow in the sky.                 The colors blend continuously into one another. At one end of the spectrum are the reds and oranges. These gradually shade into yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colors have different wavelengths, frequencies, and energies. Violet has the shortest wavelength in the visible spectrum. That means it has the highest frequency and energy. Red has the longest wavelength, and lowest frequency and energy.        LIGHT IN THE AIR  Light travels through space in a straight line as long as nothing disturbs it. As light moves through the atmosphere, it continues to go straight until it bumps into a bit of dust or a gas molecule. Then what happens to the light depends on its wave length and the size of the thing it hits.    Dust particles and water droplets are much larger than the wavelength of visible light. When light hits these large particles, it gets reflected, or bounced off, in different directions. The different colors of light are all reflected by the particle in the same way. The reflected light appears white because it still contains all of the same colors.    Gas molecules are smaller than the wavelength of visible light. If light bumps into them, it acts differently. When light hits a gas molecule, some of it may get absorbed. After awhile, the molecule radiates (releases, or gives off) the light in a different direction. The color that is radiated is the same color that was absorbed. The different colors of light are affected differently. All of the colors can be absorbed. But the higher frequencies (blues) are absorbed more often than the lower frequencies (reds). This process is called Rayleigh scattering. (It is named after Lord John Rayleigh, an English physicist, who first described it in the 1870's.)        WHY IS THE SKY BLUE?  The blue color of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering. As light moves through the atmosphere, most of the longer wavelengths pass straight through. Little of the red, orange and yellow light is affected by the air.    However, much of the shorter wavelength light is absorbed by the gas molecules. The absorbed blue light is then radiated in different directions. It gets scattered all around the sky. Whichever direction you look, some of this scattered blue light reaches you. Since you see the blue light from everywhere overhead, the sky looks blue.                 As you look closer to the horizon, the sky appears much paler in color. To reach you, the scattered blue light must pass through more air. Some of it gets scattered away again in other directions. Less blue light reaches your eyes. The color of the sky near the horizon appears paler or

When there are high levels of CO2, it triggers nerves in the brain that send signals to the diaphragm and inspiratory intercostal muscles.  These muscles contract, increasing the volume of the thoracic cavity.  This increase in volume causes a decrease in pressure, so the pressure in the lungs is lower than the air pressure.  Therefore, air is drawn into the respiratory system.

AA11513203	Macroevolution refers to the evolutionary processes that occur at a level above the species ... in other words, when there is no exchange of genetics.    This includes the process of speciation itself ... the branching of one species into two or more species when subpopulations become genetically isolated.    It's important to remember that this is not a separate process *in nature* from microevolution (the mechanisms ... like natural selection and genetic drift ... that cause changes *within* a species), but just a difference in the level of *focus* by human observers on the same process ... evolution.  It's like the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics ... or between microgrowth (cell division in the cells of a tree) and macrogrowth (the ways that the tree develops as it gets taller).   A lot of microevolution, when coupled with genetic isolation, results in macroevolution.    I include that last paragraph only because Creationists often make these two terms confusing by using them incorrectly, as if they are different "kinds" of evolution ... so that they can say they "accept microevolution" while still claiming that "macroevolution is impossible" ... which, if you understand the terms correctly, is a nonsensical statement ... equivalent to saying you "accept microgrowth" of a tree (cells dividing) but claim that "macrogrowth is impossible" (the tree can't get taller as a result of it)!|`|b52af1d124dc0f4c77d464ddd9f35cddaa	Take a look at this web site.

I0xUvDCmaa	Phospholipids are made of glyceral, glyceral also makes up oils. If you ever put oil in a cup of water you may have noticed that the oil separates from the water, this is because one side of the molecule doesn't like water and one side does. The side that likes water is called hydrophilic , the side that does not like water is hydrophobic. A molecule that has glyceral can be grouped together in many ways to make cholesteral or steriods that animals need as well as membranes. The cell membrane is made of two layers of phospholipids (which are made up of glyceral, two fatty acids and a phosphate group)  with the hydrophilic ends connecting . This layer of two phospholipids form a balloon/cell and the outside( hydrophobic) keeps water outside/ separated  from the inside of the balloon/cell. since the hydrophilic ends are touching so they don't do much, but since the other hydrophobic side makes up the inside it keeps the water from escaping.   Those are the properties for a cell membrane.|`|7B0qFbWBaa	..what..|`|62b9cb07706c86db98fa41282e9c2d9caa	A cell membrane is made of a phospholipd bilayer. This means that one side of the membrane contains 1 hyrdophilic (water loving) head. To that one head is connected 2 hyrdophobic (water fearing)  tails. The other side of the membrane is a duplicate of what I just described. In a water envrionment, the tails will face away from the water becuase they are nonpolar while the head will face towards the water becuase it is polar. (Water is polar; it will attract other polar molecules). This effects properties of the molecule because molecules that are nonpolar can easily pass throught the membrane and enter the cell. Molecules that are polar cannot enter becuase they can't get through the hyrophobic tials; therefeore, these molecules do not become part of the cell's properties.

gxRhJfL7aa	Yes you can reduce the pressure of CO2 to 600psi, I don't have boiling and melting values for CO2 but I think could be a problem after the PRV because the expansion may vaporize some of the CO2 and as it enters the water vessel it could cool the water to a point not recommended to produce the final gel.  In which the distribution is concerned, pressure loss cannot be estimated without knowing the length of the pipe and the flow of each outlet. Assuming that your cabin is not to large then I doubt that your loss will be more than 5 psi including the discharge sprinkler or nozzle, that means that the PRV can be set to a much lower pressure, what sounds more logical to me because your flow won't be to large and provide a longer protection time, so I wouldn't worry to much for the pressure losses and focus in the expansion issue.|`|MgClqETDaa	If I understand this problem correctly you are putting in a "dry sprinkler system" in your cabin and you are sectionalizing the system to certain rooms of the cabin.  Thus, the six exit lines going to six different rooms or wherever.  I am confused by what you are calling fusible links, now they could be dry sprinkler heads set to off at a certain temperature or they could be the fusible links that you would find in the fire extingushing systems found in hood systems to put out fires in large kitchens.  Lets just say that they are the dry sprinkler head types for simplicity sake.  Now if I understand it further you are using the 1500 s in the CO2 tank to pressure the other tank that is filled with water.  That I don't understand, why don't you just get another CO2 cylinder,  build a 1.5 header, connect your 1' pipes to it,then you can connect the cylinders to the header, put a regulator on each CO2 cylinder, set the regulators at the pressure you want to maintain on your system.  If you are going to have to have this tank full of water, then you would be better off to put in a pump on the tank, put the dry sprinkler system in, pressure it with an air pump that is wired to the pump so that if a sprinkler head goes off the sudden drop in air pressure kicks on the pump and puts water in the system to fight the fire.  Not knowing your real set up this is just a few suggestions, but I am assuming your cabin is out away from a fire district, and you're just wanting to get some time to get out of the cabin or worse if you get trapped in the cabin during a fire you want at least some way of fighting the fire, don't blame you a bit.

sZFLtCbdaa	All the planets circle the sun. They do so at varying speeds. For the most part the planets are all scattered going around the sun. On very rare occasions, something once every few hundred years, the planets are on the same side facing the sun. And on very real rare moments, all the planets are lined up on an almost straight line towards the sun.  Do a google search for Sky and Telescope for help on learning astronomy with terms and hints in learning the hobby of astronomy.  I strongly urge you not to buy a telescope yet. Buy instead a pair of binoculars for learning the stars and knowing and recognizing some of the planets.  Best of luck.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	Each planet goes around the Sun at a different rate.

2lQ8DJAcaa	If a Volcano Erupts Where You Live  Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately from the volcano area to avoid flying debris, hot gases, lateral blast, and lava flow.    Be aware of mudflows. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge, and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching.    Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas.    Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities.   Protection from Falling Ash  Listen to a battery-powered radio or television for the latest emergency information.    If you have a respiratory ailment, avoid contact with any amount of ash.    Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants.    Use goggles and wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses.    Use a dust mask or hold a damp cloth over your face to help with breathing.    Stay away from areas downwind from the volcano to avoid volcanic ash.    Stay indoors until the ash has settled unless there is a danger of the roof collapsing.    Close doors, windows, and all ventilation in the house (chimney vents, furnaces, air conditioners, fans, and other vents.    Clear heavy ash from flat or low-pitched roofs and rain gutters.    Avoid running car or truck engines. Driving can stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines, damage moving parts, and stall vehicles.    Avoid driving in heavy ash fall unless absolutely required. If you have to drive, keep speed down to 35 MPH or slower.|`|0mXQODsIaa	lol, get far away|`|R3Y4gsAdaa	Be as far away as possible|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Distance from the eruption is the most important thing.

You simply calculate it by finding a sample mean and dividing it by the square root of n (your sample size).

VqKHo47haa	Close, ma, in F = ma, actually means F = m * a.   The force (F) on an object with mass (m) is equal to the mass of the object (m) times the acceleration of the object due to the force (a).   Force = Mass  x  Acceleration     Force is usually given in Newtons  Mass is usually in grams or kilograms  Acceleration is usually in meters/second squared    So a using unit analysis:   F      =      m     *      a  N      =      kg    *      m/(s^2)  Together, the product of m and a is the force. But m and a are separate variables.    Intuitively, say you have a baseball that weighs (m) kilograms, throwing the ball requires force (F), which results in it being accelerated from 0 miles per hour to a higher speed, like 90 miles per hour. All F = ma means is that the force on an object depends on the mass of the object and the acceleration that resulted from the force.     For some people its easier to remember a = F/m. Which is a more logical order: the acceleration of an object is dependent on the force divided by the mass.|`|ihgspeRmaa	Yes, ma is a force. Unit for force is Kg*m/s^2, which is called Newton (N). If we analyze the expression:    Force = mass*acceleration    Mass is measured in kilograms (kg), in most of the cases, and acceleration is measured in m/s^2. The product of these two units will give you Newtons, which is a unit of force. Therefore, ma is a force.    Hope this helps.|`|FXTGvGHhaa	m is the mass of the object  a is the acceleration of the object  ma is m times a (m x a)  F=ma means that the magnitude of the force equals ma  so, ma is not a force, but it should have the same magnitude|`|P0c3JA8caa	i guess you're in my physics class. i agree, it was a poorly worded question.

uoEf9oKDaa	First you have to heat the ice from -25 C to 0 C . To do this you need to multiply the grams of ice by the specific heat of ice(.5) by the temperature change ( 25 ). This results in 5000 calories.       Then the ice needs to melt.This takes 80 calories per gram. So 80 times 400 is 32000 calories.       You now heat water from 0 to 100 C. To do this you need to multiply 400g by the specific heat of water (1) by the temperature change. The result is 40000 calories.       Next you vaporize the water to steam. This takes 540 calories per gram. This is 216000 calories.( 400 grames x 540 )       Finally you heat the steam from 100 C to 275 C. To do this multiply 400 grams by the specific heat of ice (.5) times the temperature change (175 C) this is 35000 calories.    Add all the calories together to arrive at your answer.
524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	We often use 300,000 km/s for a good approximation for the speed of light.

The slope of the perpendicular line is the OPPOSITE RECIPROCAL of this slope. This means you flip the slope of the line (which we have) and then if it's positive, make it negative (which it is).

AA11513203	There is no "line."    These are two areas of *FOCUS* on the same process ... evolution ... which does not have a "line."    Biologists define microevolution as "the evolutionary changes at or below the species level."  In other words, it covers the *mechanism* by which species change (namely natural selection and genetic drift).    Biologists define macroevolution as "the focus or study of evolution at or above the species level."  In other words it studies the effects on populations that are not exchanging genetics.      As such, macroevolution, by definition, includes the process of 'speciation' itself ... the branching of a species into two or more species when subpopulations get genetically isolated from each other.    So at the very place there would appear to be a "line"  ... namely the creation of a new species ...  both microevolutionary effects (such as the natural selection that is causing genetic change in both populations) and macroevolutionary effects (whatever is causing the isolation between the two subpopulations) are happening.    So there is no "line."    It is a difference in "scale" or "focus" in the STUDY or ANALYSIS of evolution by human observers ... not a dividing "line" in evolution itself ... not a line *in nature*.    ...    If the above is hard to understand, then let me try a different analogy:    Warm up exercise:    What is the "line" between microgrowth and macrogrowth of a tree?   Microgrowth refers to the aspects of growth you see under a microscope ... the division of cells in the wood and leaves.   Macrogrowth refers to the way the branches divide and the tree grows taller over long time.    There is no "line" where microgrowth "ends" and macrogrowth "begins".    If the cells are dividing at the 'micro' level, then WITH ENOUGH TIME this produces branching and an increase in height of the tree at the 'macro' level.        There is no "line" *in nature* between microgrowth and macrogrowth.    The same is true about evolution.  If natural selection is occurring and the species is changing at the 'micro' level, then WITH ENOUGH TIME, and *genetic isolation*, this produces branching of the species, and major changes to structures at the 'macro' level.    There is no "line" *in nature* between microevolution and macroevolution.    ---- {edit} ----    >"so first guy, agamids, 300+ speices, micro or macro?"    That depends on what your question is.   If it is about why some agamid species are gray and some are blue, that would be because of microevolutionary changes within each of those 300 species (they are all evolving separately).   If you are asking why there are so many agamid species to begin with, that is the question of speciation, and that is a macroevolutionary question.|`|ZlOF7pPgaa	Hard to answer, because the two are so interdependent. Micro usually deals with changes in the frequency of specific traits/genes within a population and macro is more associated with with speciation but it really isn't that simple.

AWPaPV4Eaa	Glycolic acid or oxalic acid.  When you oxidize a primary alcohol, you will first form an aldehyde on the carbon that had the -OH group.  Further oxidation gives a carboxylic acid on this carbon.  Ethylene glycol has two hydroxyl groups.  Full oxidation of one of these carbons gives glycolic acid, while full oxidation of both yields oxalic acid.  Both are toxic and are produced by the body as metabolites of ethylene glycol - this is why ethylene glycol is toxic.
SYSCiRhsaa	Molecules that possess a dipole moment contain atoms with very different electronegativities sharing a bond.  Electronegativity is an atom's electron affinity, that is its ability and tendency to attract electrons.  Moving from left to right across a period (row) on the periodic table, excluding the noble gases in the very far left column, and from the bottom to the top of a group (column) elements become more electronegative.  So oxygen is more electronegative than nitrogen which you can tell because it is to the right of nitrogen on the periodic table.  Oxygen is also more electronegative than sulfur; it sits right above sulfur on the periodic table.  Fluorine is the most electronegative element.      When atoms with similar electronegativities, such as carbon and hydrogen, or two of the same atom (two oxygens, two chlorines, whatever) share a covalent bond the electrons spend approximately equal time across the entire length of the bond.  But when an electronegative element like oxygen bonds with a more electropositive  ("less electronegative") a polar covalent bond is formed between the atoms.  Oxygen and hydrogen form polar covalent bonds and the electrons in the OH bond are not evenly distributed but tend to spend more time near the oxygen atom because they are more strongly attracted to the nucleus of the oxygen atom than they are to the hydrogen nucleus (this is the definition of electronegativity).  If the electronegativity difference between the two elements is great enough it is considered an ionic bond, like you find in NaCl or nitric acid (HNO3), where one element (or in the case of nitrate, a polyatomic ion) "steals" an electron from the electropositive element.    Dipole moment describes the separation of charge across the length of the bond, or the entire molecule as the case may be.  The bond has two poles, a slightly positive pole and a slightly negative pole.  The slight negative charge will be localized on the electronegative atom which has a greater electron density around it, while the partial positive charge will be localized on the electropositive element, which is electron deficient.  In water (H2O) the oxygen atom has a partial negative charge and each hydrogen has a partial positive charge.     Since opposite charges are attracted to each other, the negative dipole on one atom will be attracted to the positive dipole on another atom, or to a positively charged ion.  This attraction is called the dipole-dipole interaction.  For example in a glass of water the oxygen atoms in one H2O molecule will orient themselves toward hydrogen atoms attached to adjacent H2O molecules. The same occurs when you make a solution of different chemical, such as short-chain alcohols (e.g. methyl, ethyl and propyl alcohols) which contain polar OH groups dissolved in water.  Ion-dipole attraction describes the attraction between ions and polar chemicals.    Polarity is a property not just of a bond but of an entire molecule, and is based on the dominant features of the molecule.  Methanol (aka methyl alcohol), is CH3OH and although the CH bonds are non-polar and the CO bond is not particularly polar, the strong polarity of the OH bond gives the entire a molecule a polar character which allows it to dissolve very well in water, thanks to the attraction between the poles of each molecule.  Ethanol is CH3CH2OH and is also highly soluble in water, but alcohols with longer carbon chains are much less soluble because the non-polar nature of the hydrocarbon chain dominates the behavior of the molecule.  Decanol is a 10-carbon alcohol which is not soluble in water.    The attraction between non-polar molecules are van der Waals forces.  This is the sort of attraction that would allow for a mixture of different fats and oils to be made.  You can't mix oil and water because the polar water molecules are strongly attracted to each other and the non-polar oils are attracted to each other, but the oils are not attracted to the water.  Fatty acids, paraffins, long-chain alcohols like octanol and decanol, compounds composed of the same element like molecular nitrogen (N2), molecular oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3) are all non-polar molecules that would interact with each other and with other non-polar molecules through van der Walls forces.      In order to determine whether or not a bond will be polar you need to look at a table of electronegativities (like this http://inst.sfcc.edu/~jbieber/CCHEM/elec...  The scales can be a little different but your textbook will probably describe the electronegativity differences that constitute ionic, polar and non-polar covalent bonds.|`|3b1KrGHTaa	The answer above me is very complete. Dipole-dipole interactions occur between molecules that have net dipoles. A molecule has a net dipole if:  1) It is composed of elements of unequal electronegativity, such as Carbon and Fluorine  2) It has lone pairs  The electrons are pulled to the more electronegative element (or to the lone pair) and a dipole moment is established in the molecule.     Every molecule should be attracted through van der Waals forces, but it is the only force present in nonpolar molecules. Van der Waals forces are induced dipoles, when there is no net dipole, but when there is a temporary dipole. It can happen because electrons are constantly moving, even in a bond, and they can momentarily be closer to one atom than to another. When this happens, there is a partial charge on that atom, and that induces partial charges on other atoms, until a weak attractive force occurs among atoms on different molecules.     Look at this picture for a more visual explanation:  http://www.steve.gb.com/images/science/v...|`|n3JHSUz0aa	Put simply, a dipole-dipole interaction is when there are lone pair electrons on a molecule that is not an ion. You have to draw out the lewis dot structure and then when you find out there are lone pair electrons gathered unequally on one side, it is said there is a dipole.
nAvNSL1yaa	To find the empirical formulas divide the percentage by their molar mass then divide all the numbers by the smallest number.    Eg 60.87% C, 4.38% H, and 34.75% O.    60.87/molar mass of C    4.38/ molar mass of H    34.75 / molar mass of O    Then which ever one has the smallest number divide all the numbers by this number and you'll have your ratios.

Science deals only with the natural world and god is, by definition, supernatural. It's a pretty poor atheist who doesn't know that.|`|JSxvTezkaa	I am a Christian, first of all.    Disproving the existence of God is very difficult. Why?    Think of trying to prove that there is no gold in China. To do that, you'd have to inspect every nook and cranny in the country, break every rock...    Say that you inspect half of China. You still can't really make the statement "There is no gold in China", because there could still be gold where you haven't searched.    Disproving God would be very, very difficult.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Science is concerned with the pursuit of facts and data.  It uses the scientific method of inquiry - gathering observable, empirical and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning.  It collects data through observation and experimentation, formulates and tests hypotheses, revises and corrects theories.    The existence of God is not something for which data can be gathered, tested, and experimented.  So it isn't a theory or hypothesis that can be scientifically studied or determined.|`|wUNQJWuvaa	Hehe, I could go on and on.  Firstly, The bible says that god created the universe in 6 days but how is that possible if the Universe is infinite???

It's like trying to prove whether or not an apple is red by smelling it.|`|UptQ1JFZaa	That is outside the realm of science, so no.|`|iN91UZvdaa	There is one thing in science which can not be proved or disproved, the existence of a being beyond our own comprehension. I do not say god because your question is misleading! You say god as if referring to a religious figure. The term god applies to many religions so in essence you are asking whether or not science can prove or disprove that religion is correct in its beliefs of a higher power.     Me personally, I don't believe in religion but I do believe in god. Confused? To me, the term god refers to the force that makes creation and existence possible, or more precisely I believe that the word god and the word universe are one and the same. Whether there is a will is beyond my comprehension.     The reason I believe this is down to religion being unable to prove some of the things they claim in their bibles and manuscripts. There are contradictions, discrepancies and a lot of stuff that makes no ounce of sense. On a personal level it is related to the fact that religion causes the death of millions. Woman were hunted as witches for years until the modern times where it was proven that witches could not exist since magic did not exist. King Henry the 8ths manipulation of religion to support his own needs, divorcing his first wife so that he could have some other tart. To me religion supposed to be pure but it is not, it is a tool that can be used negatively when it is not supposed to be.    In my media class we learned that religion like many things in life nothing more than a construct for control similar to media (ironic I know.) People are so unable to live maturely and independently that they need a crutch or habit to support themselves. There are three kinds of people in the world those who believe in science, those who believe in religion and those who don't give a ****.|`|hO7g5Y9taa	You don't need to disprove Gods existence, just look at some of the evidence.   1. We share 98% of our DNA with chimps.  2. Would you let your children kill each other?   3. Would you let your children suffer and die from disease?  4. Would you let your children die from natural disasters?  5. Would you let your children destroy their only home that you built?   Don't even try the idiotic "free will" argument, it is laughable.  At best it is pure negligence.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	If there is one thing on which scientists and religious people have agreed on is that one cannot use science to prove or disprove God.    What science can do (and this annoys a lot of religious people) is show that what some people claim to be a "proof" of God's existence, are not really proofs.    However, proving that someone else's proof is wrong, is not in itself a proof that you are right.    For example, Galileo was trying to defend Kepler's planetary system (where the planets are in orbit around the Sun) against the geocentric system (planets are in orbit around Earth).    His "proof"?  there were moons in orbit around Jupiter.    That might be a proof that not everything was in orbit around Earth.  However it certainly was NOT a proof that Kepler's system was OK.  If anything, it could have been used as an indication that all planets were in orbit around Jupiter (which we know to be wrong anyways).    ---    When Father Lemaitre came up with the Primordial Atom Hypothesis, that led to the theory that our universe has been expanding (and cooling) from an initial state of extreme energy density, most scientists did not accept his idea.    Fred Hoyle (the best astrophysicist in those days) had a much simpler theory (Steady State)      Not only the universe looked the same in all directions (isotropy, which was observed), but it had always looked the same(the Perfect Isotropy -- the dream of astrophysicists and cosmologists at the time).      It also had the "advantage", according to Fred, that it showed God to be unnecessary:   Eternal Universe = no creation = no Creator    For Fred, to have a priest come back with a theory that allowed that the universe did have a beginning (therefore, could have been created) was just a ploy to annoy atheists (Fred was publicly proud to be a convinced atheist).      Fred is the one who came up with the awful name "Big Bang" to make fun of Father Lemaitre's theory.    Well, later observations with better instruments showed that the Steady State theory was wrong and that the Big Bang theory was most useful.    Big Bang does not say that God must exist.  It merely allows that the universe could have been created by God (the theory itself does not care where the initial energy came from, it simply describes what happens to it during expansion).    ---    It seems that every time we try to set up scientific theories to either prove God existence or to prove His absence, these theories end up failing.    One "idea" (that far back, it was not presented as a theory) was that humans were so different from animals that they were the proof that God exists.  For sure.  I mean, look at us.    Well, Darwin came along and showed that evolution could have created us without divine intervention.  His theory does not state that God does not intervene.  It merely offers the possibility that God does not need to intervene with the evolution process.    (Evolution was already accepted before Darwin -- however, it was assumed that divine intervention guided it).    ---    And so on.    So, it seems that we cannot use science to prove one way or the other.    No match, the board goes back.|`|ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	No.  Science by definition is about the natural world.  Religion is about the supernatural.  The two do not shake hands.|`|lcg1u1U7aa	It is not possible to prove or disprove the existence of God.  God is transcendent, standing above the physical universe in all ways.  If you accept the existence of God it can be by faith alone.|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	No, I reject the very concept of asking someone to use science to prove or disprove the existence of God.    It is the purview of those claiming the existence to prove it.  There is no evidence (real, hard, physical evidence), so we cannot disprove it.  But at the same time, they cannot prove it, or even tilt the scales of probability.    No evidence means no proof is possible.
ycbkzprjaa	As said before me, the planets' orbits are very stable. But we do know that nothing is perfect in this universe, things change. In this case, things are changing very slowly. Example: Our moon in a billion years from now will have a "drastically" altered orbit, contrasted to where it is today. It will not be an abrupt shift, but will take a billion years to happen. Our moon a billion years ago was "drastically" closer to earth than it is today. Again, the change was not abrupt, but took a billion years to happen. I use the moon's case as something we are aware of and can actually detect. For the other planets in our solar system, the changes happening are so minuscule that we cannot detect them. This is precisely why we say the orbits are "stable."|`|jcGeCJnOaa	In our solar system? Probably not for about another 5 billion years when the Sun begins to loose mass as it expands into a red giant and form a planetary nebula. In other solar systems? Who knows. We just don't have telescopes with enough resolution to see them clearly (yet).|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	"orbital resonance changes orbital patterns little by little" -  little by little, gradually over time.    There is no sudden change in a planet's orbit unless it approaches (or is closely approached by) a massive object.  Comets and asteroids can have their orbits dramatically changed by the close approach to a large object (such as Jupiter or Saturn) but planets in stable orbits around the sun do not suddenly change their orbits.|`|UAYzLyN4aa	No "drastic shift" is "due to occur." The planets' orbits are too far apart for that.|`|vxSXsn59aa	Right around the 12th of Never. Major alterations to planetary orbits can occur due to collisions, but objects large enough to alter an orbit are rare in the solar system these days.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	There is nothing more stable in the universe than planetary orbits.

If the lines overlap (ie, look like one line), the equasions are equal. If they don't and you see two different lines, they are not equal.    If you have to do it without a calculator, (I think) you'll need to plug in values for theta.

AA10927246	Let's say it was doubling every hour.  Then you'd multiply the original amount by 2, then 4, then 8, etc.  That would be 2^t.    But here you said it happens every 1/2 hour.  So on the hour it would have doubled twice (4 times).  Then doubled twice again (16 times), etc.  So instead of t, the exponent would be 2t.    Answer:  P(t) = 150 * 2^(2t)    Since 2^(2t) = (22)^t, you could also write this as:  P(t) = 150 * 4^t    Now you could find the population for any value of t:  P(1) = 600  P(2) = 2,400  P(3) = 9,600  P(4) = 38,400  P(5) = 153,600  P(6) = 614,400  etc.  P(t) = 150 * 4^t|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It's an exponential growth, so you need an exponential equation.

Ftkr9jqYaa	It is important that cytoplasmic digestive enzymes be compartmentalized in membrane-bound organelles (such as vacuoles, lysosomes, and peroxisomes), because if such enzymes were alllowed to move freely throughout the cell, they would tend to digest and destroy essential structural and functional compounds.    Digestion is able to effectively occur within organelles because whenever there is a need to metabolize specific biochemicals, they are transported into the organelles by at least one of several modes of movement, such as active transport, pinocytosis (pinching of small pockets of macromolecules into the organelle), phagocytosis (ingestion of other dying cells or larger extracellular material), endocytosis (where receptor proteins are recycled from the cell surface), or autophagy (wherein old or unneeded organelles or proteins, or microbes that have invaded the cytoplasm are delivered to the lysosome).  Once the macromolecules are delivered into the organelle, they are ready for digestion.  The products of digestion can be transported by various processes, including diffusion into the cytosol, movement to needed locations via active transport, exocytotic excretion, or other methods.

dQrBlk4qaa	The differences in bonding have to do principally with the interaction between the two elements participating.     If its is a strong electronegative interaction, it is an ionic bond. This is where atoms are paired with each other based on being positive and negative ions. You can generally assume a bond is ionic if the differences in the ion's electronegativity is greater than 2.0. This type of bond is found between a metal ion and a non-metal, and is characterized as one atom "donating" an electron to the other, and the resulting electrostatic charge holds the atoms together.     If the bond electronegativity is less than 1.5, you can assume the bond is covalent. A covalent bond "shares" its electrons more freely between each participating atom.    (mind you there's no real such thing as a "purely" ionic bond, or a purely covalent one, but you'll learn that eventually....)    In a metallic bond, the electrons disassociate themselves over several atoms that are spread out in a lattice. They jump across the electron shells.

The blood then travels into progressively smaller and smaller vessels until they reach capillaries surround alveolar sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place.  The CO2 in the blood is released into the alveoli and O2 from the alveoli is absorbed into the blood and bound to hemoglobin.  The oxygenated blood then returns to the heart via the pulmonary veins.  The oxygenated blood then gets pumped to the systemic arterial network, including the coronary arteries which supply the heart muscles with blood.    The respiratory system also aides in increase in cardiac output.  As the muscles in the diaphragm and intercostal spaces contract, they create a negative pressure "vacuum" in the thoracic cavity.  This negative pressure not only allows the lungs to suck in air, but it creates a pressure gradient between the vena cavae and the cavity.  This pressure difference allows for an increase in venous return to the blood to the heart.  This increase in return stretches the right atrial walls stimulating a sympathetic response that increases heart rate and stroke volume, both of which increase cardiac output.|`|UmtOV8mRaa	De-oxygenated blood which is pumped to the lungs is oxygenated by the lungs.

So eventually the pendulum will stay tilted to the left of the centre. Before that happens, however, it will oscillate about that point until the dampening effects of the pendulum gradually make it reach that point.    Note: I assumed that it was a constant acceleration "turned on" at some point. Also, this is from the point of view of an observer in the car. This is not an inertial reference frame. An observer in a parallel inertial reference frame would see the entire system accelerating to the right.    EDIT: with the extra information, this is a clarification of what happens from the point of view of a person sitting in the car:    before the impulse begins: the pendulum is hanging straight down. Let's call this point O.    after the impulse begins: the pendulum jerks to the left, and just reaches a point (let's call it point A). It then swings back a little to the right, and just reaches point (let's call it C). It then oscillates between A and C. Let's call the point where it has the fastest speed point B. Now, B is between A and C. However, B is NOT O: B is to the LEFT of O. In other words, the pendulum is oscillating, but about a point to the LEFT of where it would have been oscillating if the car had just been standing still or moving at a constant velocity. If there are dampening effects, the pendulum will eventually settle on point B.|`|6w5lZ5p5aa	Need more Info. Is the pendulum swinging (oscillating) or stationary at the start, if swinging, is it swinging along the longitudinal or lateral axis of the car? And, is the car accelerating in a driving type turn or just accelerating sideways.    Thanks,  Lunar Orbit Insertion Burn

To get from km to m --> there are 1000m in 1km so multiply by 1000                     90km = 90 000m    To get from hours to seconds --> there are 3600 seconds in an hour so multiply by 3600                     1h = 3600s    So your speed changes from 90km/h to 90 000m/3600s  Now you just need to simplify the fraction  90 000 divided by 3600 =25    So 90 000m/3600s = 25m/1s                              = 25m/s|`|M5RkgBqFaa	Use unit conversions. The same units on the top will cancel out with the same units on the bottom.

xpyQZba7aa	I agree with the first answer.    1/10 of the sampe is C4H10 and 9/10 is O2    So you have 1 ml of C4H10  and 9 ml of O2    The equation is already balanced, just add all the atoms up and make sure there are the same number of each atom on each side.    The ideal gas law states that 1 mole of any ideal gas occupies the same volume as 1 mole of any other ideal gas under the same conditions of Temp and pressure.    What this means is that your volume ratio (1 : 9) is exactly the same as your mole ratio (1 : 9)    So 1 ml C4H10 needs 6.5 ml O2 to fully react    There will be 9 - 6.5 = 2.5 ml of O2 left over|`|pSOQTumdaa	i don't know what you mean by 1/10 and 9/10 but lets' say that there is 1 mole of butane and 9 moles of oxygen present  2 moles of butane require 13 moles of oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide.  so, if you have 1 mole of butane, you only require 6.5 moles of oxygen.  you are given 9 moles of oxygen.  so 9-6.5 = 2.5 moles of oxygen left over

Then I'll take care of the perpendicular bisector.  ---------------------------    The standard slope-intercept equation is of the form:    y = mx + b (where m is the slope and b is an unknown constant which is the value of the y value of the y intercept.)    The slope of a line connecting two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)    For this problem that is (2 - (-4) / (4  - (-5)) which is:    6 / (-9)  = (-2/3) = m (the slope)...  -----------------------    The perpendicular bisector must have a slope of (-1/m) which for this problem is (-1/-(2/3))  Multiply both the numerator and denominator by -2 getting (3/2)  ---------------------------    The distance between the two points is sqrt[ (-9)^2 + 6^2] = sqrt(81 + 36) = sqrt(117) = sqrt(3 * 3 * 13) = sqrt(3 * 3) * sqrt(13) = 3 * sqrt(13)    So the length of the line segment is 3 * sqrt(13)...  --------------------------    For a perpendicular bisector we have to average the coefficients of the two points, getting    (((5-4)/2), ((2-4)/2) = ((1/2), (-1))    We know from the above work that the slope of the line passing through this point is (2/3).    y = (3/2)*x + b....Substitute the values of the point ((1/2), (-1)) into this equation.    -1 = ((3/2) * (1/2))  + b =   -1 = ((3/4) + b.....Subtract (3/4) from both sides of this equation.    b = -1 - (3/4) = -(4/4) - (3/4) = (-7/4)    So the equation of the perpendicular bisector is:    y = (3/2) * x - (7/4)  --------------|`|ixzVKzBjaa	Length    d=[(x-x1)2+(y-y1)2]    Slope    m=(y-y1)/(x-x1)    To find the length...

8Y7LQ6TGaa	well, you don't say which sides the wires are connected.     But the actual current is in the thousands of amps. I'm not sure what you mean by max and min currents.     The actual current, if the 7 volt source is a theoretical perfect source, can be done by calculating the resistance of the block.Resistance of a wire  R = L/A   is resistivity of the material  L is length in meters  A is cross-sectional area in m2    say the source is connected the long way, and the current flows parallel to the 36 cm dimension.  resistivity Cu 17.2 (n-m)  L = 0.36 m  A = 0.12 x 0.21 = 0.0252 m2  R = 17.2 (n-m) x 0.36/0.0252 = 246 n = 0.246     I = E/R = 7/0.246  = 28.5 kA or 28500 amps.    if you connect the source to different sides, the current will be larger.    If by min max you mean as you change the connection points, then the 28500 amps is the min.       max would be connecting across the 12 cm dimension    R = 17.2 (n-m) x 0.12/(0.21*0.36) = 27.3 n = 0.0273   I = E/R = 7/0.0273  = 256 kA or 256000 amps.      .

8dffbce3266bc6eb44bbe27559482b26aa	Thermo is like that, but you are just going to have learn to live with it.   We use to say that thermo consists of defining something that is not very clear and then using an equation to find it with some other concept that it not clear, and so on.     Enthalpy is not an easy concept, but neither is internal energy.   Yet, if you define a value at a standard condition, it can be measured relative to that value.  Think of enthalpy as some type of total energy that a substance has by virtue of the activity of its components ( a micromolar effect) plus the virtue of occupying space and exerting pressure (a macromolar effect).       I don't know if you have taken calculus, but if you have d(PV), you only get the two components PdV and VdP out of it.   This is a fundamental concept of integral calculus.
VJ3NTPL7aa	At rest, the inside of the cell (neuron) is negative relative to the outside of the cell. The resting potential is approximately - 70mV, in other words the outside of the cell is 70mV greater than the inside. A stimulus causes the resting potential to move toward 0 mV. At -55mV the threshold is reached and an action potential fires. The Na+ channels open. There are more Na+ ions outside the cell ----> Na+ rushes into the cell. The neuron becomes more positive and becomes depolarized. K+ channels open ----> K+ rushes out of the cell reversing the depolarization. The Na+ channels begin to close. Gradually the ion concentration returns to its resting state.  In answer to your question, when the cell is in its resting state, the K+ ion concentration is higher inside the cell, the Na+ ion (and Cl- ion) concentration is higher outside the cell. However, Na+ and Cl- ions have a hard time crossing the membrane when the cell is at rest, while K+ ions cross the membrane easily. As a result, positive ions flow out more readily than they flow in leaving a negative voltage (- 70mV) inside.    I hope that helps. Good luck.  K+ ions cross the membrane easily, but Na+ (and Cl-) have difficulty crossing the membrane.

Since you have 55.5 moles of water per liter, there are no important changes to the water content, so that is "included" in Kb.  So, if a small amount of NH3 dissociates, [OH-] and [NH4+] are formed on a 1 to 1 basis.  Call these X,  Moreover, X is so small compared to 0.27 M, it can be neglected where [NH3] occurs.

0ef3fe6c7481b16aa8b6060d7f055afaaa	for your answer, you need the density of pure zinc, let's call that Z.  If you knew that, then the mass of a penny made entirely of zinc would be    density = mass / volume    mass = volume * density     mass of pennyMadeOfZinc = 0.42 * Z    --    so, how do you compute Z.    I infer that when you say "density of a penny is 7.14 zinc" you are saying the mass of the total zinc in the penny, divided by the total volume of the penny, it 7.14    And when you say a penny is 97.5% zinc, you mean by volume, not by mass.    If that's what you mean, then the volume of the zinc in the normal penny is 97.5% of the total (0.42) so the zinc volume is (0.42 * .975) or .409    So    7.14 (density) = massOfZincInPenny / 0.42 (full vol)    therefor    massOfZincInPenny = 7.14 * 0.42  = 2.99    and    densityOfPureZinc (Z) = 2.99 (mass of zinc)  / 0.409 (volume of zinc)    so Z = 7.31  (density of pure zinc)    plug that into original question and the mass of a pure zinc penny is    3.07    Now, looking on wikipedia, the density of zinc is apparently 7.04, hence at least one of my assumptions about your question was incorrect.    perhaps the penny is 97.5% zinc by mass instead of volume.

Do the same thing with the other two traits and you get:    Brown eyes - 3/4  Blue eyes - 1/4  Non-flying - 3/4  Flying - 1/4  Brown hair - 3/4  Blonde hair - 1/4    So the proportion of offspring with brown eyes, non-flying and brown hair would be 3/4*3/4*3/4 = 27/64.    And the proportion of offspring with blue eyes, non-flying and brown hair would be 1/4*3/4*3/4 = 9/64.    The proportion of offspring with brown eyes, flying and brown hair would be 3/4*1/4*3/4 = 9/64.    etc.    Keep going like that until you get all the phenotypes (8 of them) figured out. And results should add to 1.|`|UmtOV8mRaa	Is it possible to breed a flying creature with a non-flying one?

ZlOF7pPgaa	Killing bacteria and eliminating endotoxin in the food that is there as a result of a bacteria are two different questions. Heating to the point of boiling will kill most bacteria in the meat. But if the meat is contaminated and the bacteria has reached a certain level, the toxins present in the bacterial endotoxins will still be there and can still cause problems (though there is a continuum based on how much toxin is present).    If you are really that worried about it you can stick to cooking your own food and buy your produce and meat only from reputable sources. This would at least limit the chances of getting food poisoning from bad meat that a restaurant decided to cook anyways or getting a "fecal born" case of food poisoning from some cook that didn't wash his/her hands (Hepatitis A, Cholera).
MJBpR9byaa	The average value of the function is 989.6;   here is how you find it:     We need, first, to find   I = f(x) dx, where   f(x) = 2x3 (1 + x2)^4.     Now, (1 + z)^4 = 1 + 4z + 6z2 + 4z3 + x^4.    Thus, letting z = x2, we have  (1 + x2)^4 = 1 + 4x2 + 6x^4 + 4x^6 + x^8; and  f(x) = 2x3 (1 + x2)^4    = 2(x3 + 4x^5 + 6x^7 + 4x^9 + x^11).    Integrating, term by term, we obtain   I = 2 [ ?x^4 + (4*1/6)x^6 + (6*1/8)x^8   + (4*1/10)x^10 + (1/12)x^12 ]   = (1/60) [ 30x^4 + 80x^6 + 90x^8 + 48x^10 + 10x^12 ] .    Then, when x = 2,   I = (1/60) [ 30(16) + 80(64) + 90(256) + 48(1,024) + 10(4,096) ] .  = (1/60) (480 + 5,120 + 23,040 + 49,152 + 40,960)   = (1/60) (118,752)   = 1,979.2;   and, when x = 0, I = 0.    Thus, the total area under the curve,   and between x = 0 and x = 2, is 1,979.2;   and the average height is 989.6,   which is also the average value of the function,   the result we sought.

HtBcGy1raa	Green eyes are recessive, meaning the gene is likely in most of your family/ancestors, but their dominant eye color overrides that gene, basically. You are homozygous for green eyes, meaning you received two copies of the "green eyes" gene from your parents. I know this because again, green eyes are recessive, and recessive traits only show up when you only have copies of this gene.    Another important thing to note is that green eyes are also the rarest eye color, so although I'm not positive, I think blue eyes are dominant over green, and any shade of brown is dominant over all colors.    It's likely that one or some of your ancestors or relatives that you've never met had green eyes, because you must have gotten the gene from both of your parents for it to be dominant in you, or physically expressed, as it is in you. I hope this wasn't too confusing...basically genetic traits are usually either recessive or dominant, and the dominant gene is more likely to override the recessive one, meaning the recessive won't been physically seen, though it's in others' genetic makeup.    Eye color and hair color can be affected by other factors though, such as environmental. Also, physical traits can change, for example I do not have blonde hair anymore, it turned light brown recently. Brown hair is dominant over blonde hair, so again, your family must have the gene but you are homozygous for blonde hair, meaning you got two "blonde" genes from your parents, who were heterozygous: they carry a blonde gene and another gene, like brown, red, or black.    Sorry if this was confusing, I tried to make it easy to understand, but I almost started to confuse myself, haha. Have a good day!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I think it's time you started asking questions...

In other words, some of your ancestors had the genetic code for green eyes and blond hair, but they weren't able to show them properly because the genetic code for blue and brown eyes and dark hair dominated over them. But somehow, both your parents only gave you the code for green eyes and blond hair and not the code for the darker colors. That means you only had the code for green eyes and blond hair, so you got green eyes and blond hair.     The actual situation is a lot more complicated than this.

Wagcdklxaa	There is an inverse relationship between the diameter/radius of a pulley and its rotational speed. The bigger the diameter/radius is, the slower the rotational speed is.    Assuming that there is no loss of energy due to friction and belt slippage, then the working formula is    (NR)b = (NR)s    where    N = rotational speed  R = radius  "b" and "s" are subscripts that refer to big pulley and small pulley, respectively.

Then, using dimensional analysis:    speed =  (0.6 pedal_revolution) / sec  *  (9 rear revolution)/(5 pedal_revolution) *  (28 * pi inches) / (1 rear revolution) *  (1 foot) / (12 inches) *  1 mile / 5280 feet *  60 sec / 1 minute *  60 minutes / 1 hour    Note that all of the units cancel except for  miles/hour.    speed = (0.6 * 9/5 * 28 * 60 * 60) / (12 * 5280)  speed = 1.7181818... miles/hour    Rounding to the nearest tenth:    speed = 1.7 miles/hour

fec9977a5483ec366a466856bafd9b4daa	Ah, a good old impulse problem!    What they're asking for you to do here is to figure the change in momentum (impulse), which can be divided by time to get force.? You have to be careful here to include weight, which is acting all the time.    You have two phases of a jump:  1. The flight phase  2. The bounce phase    The flight phase goes up to 12 cm altitude.? You can approach the problem from here on out in two ways:    a. Calculate the time of flight, calculate that the total impulse averaged over both the flight and the bounce equals the weight, and divide W*(flight+bounce)/bounce to get the average bounce force.  b. Calculate the speed of the landing from an altitude of 12 cm and the momentum, add the need for a takeoff to an altitude of 12 cm for the next bounce (same as momentum of landing but in the upward direction), divide this impulse by 0.6 sec to get the force... and add the weight of Stewart+stick, because that has to be borne by the earth too.    I'll leave the rest of the problem for you, as it's your homework and having answers handed to you won't get you past the next quiz, let alone the final.
Wagcdklxaa	>    Working formula is    Vf - V = aT    where    Vf = velocity of car after braking period  V = velocity oc car before brakes were applied  a = acceleration = - 2 m/sec^2  T = braking time = 3 sec.    Substituting values,    Vf - V = -2(3)     NOTE -- the negative sign attached to the acceleration simply implies that the car was slowing down when the brakes were applied.    Vf - V = - 6 --- call this Equation 1     To determine the speed of the car before the brakes were applied, the formula is    V - Vo = aT    where    V = velocity of car before brakes were applied  Vo = initial velocity of car = 0 (started at rest)  a = acceleration = 1.5 m/sec (given)  T = time = 5 sec.    Substituting values,    V - 0 = 1.5(5)    V = 7.5 m/sec. and substituting this values into Equation 1    Vf - 7.5 = - 6    and solving for Vf,    Vf = 1.5 m/sec.    >    I will assume that this is the total distance the car has travelled since it started from rest and until the end of the braking period.

T = braking time = 3 sec.  a = acceleration during braking time = 2 m/sec^2    D2 = 7.5*3 + (1/2)(-2)(3)^2    D2 = 22.5 - 9    D2 = 13.5 meters    Hope this helps.|`|SNkDwJvEaa	I honestly don't no.
wMmsWpsyaa	Note that the question asked for velocity, not speed.  Velocity = displacement/time  Displacement = how far away you are from your starting point, not how far you have travelled.    Total distance travelled in due west:  35/2 + 60 X 2 = 137.5mi    Now comes the tricky part. Since you are having problem with this question, I guess that the phrasing of the problem must have confused you. It is quite tricky indeed.   Note that up to this point, Jason is driving due west, which means that in his point of view, he is driving north. I suspect that the "farther west" mentioned in the question may be actually south of his original direction.    Distance travelled in "farther west":  25/60X33 = 13.75mi    Using Pythagorean Theorem, the displacement from the original point is:    sqrt(13.75^2 + 137.5^2) = 138.2mi    Velocity = Displacement/time = 138.2/(2+1/2+33/60) = 45.3mi/h

ZlOF7pPgaa	PCR samples undergo a variety of temperatures. The DNA is usually first "melted" at a high temperature to separate the strands. This is usually done at a temperature high enough to denature most proteins which is why a special polymerase is used. These polymerases, usually Taq or Vent, come from archae bacteria that live near geothermal vents near the ocean floor and are well adapted for living in high temperatures. Were you to use human or E. coli polymerase, the protein would denature long before the DNA strands would melt.

For example: Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology by H. Martini.   There are plenty used and cheap ones at Half Price book stores. Maybe your local library has one. Just be sure to find one that is not too difficult for you to read.   Most Medicine is learning new vocabulary.    If you want a more difficult book that incorporates some math try:  Physiology by Linda Costanzo     Looking up the diseases mention in House, MD and reading about it on Wikipedia.com is also good. After you read anything interesting try to teach or explain it to your parents or friends...that way you will always remember it.    Medicine is about the balance of wisdom and compassion.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Root hair cells, the rhizoids of many vascular plants, are tubular outgrowths of trichoblasts, the hair-forming cells on the epidermis of a plant root.    The root system of a flowering plant consists of one or more main roots from which small rootlets branch. The ends of these rootlets are covered with a fuzz-like growth, which consists of many tiny projections called root hairs.  These slender processes serve to absorb water and dissolved mineral compounds from the soil. Water enters root hairs from the soil and moves to all parts of the plant. As the water enters and moves through the plant, it carries the dissolved minerals that the plant needs for growth.

If the negative is INSIDE OF THE PARENTHESES for both of your two examples, then there is no difference (-2*-2*-2).

The general rule is to perform what is in parenthesis first. If there are no parenthesis, powers are done first then multiply or divide is done after.  For your first question, the only difference is the way one speaks those numbers. (2)^3 is spoken "2 quantity cubed." (2^3) is spoken "2 cubed quantity." They are both numerically identical.  (-2)^3 will be negative. (-2^3) will be negative.  (-2)^2 will be positive. (-2^2) will be negative, keep in mind that every negative number is understood to really be (-1) times that number. Example: -2 = (-1)2. So, (-2^2) is ((-1)2^2).  Your actual problem:  (16)(3)^2 = x(2^3)    is     16 times 9 = x times 8                                            144/8   =  x  = 18     done.

AWPaPV4Eaa	It would be something that changes color in UV radiation, as this is the main thing that distinguishes sunlight from interior lighting.    I will keep looking to see if I can find what chemicals are used.  I'm going to check for MSDS sheets for their nail polish.    One thing that I couldn't figure out from their site is whether the products change color permanently upon sun exposure, will change back if left out of sunlight for a while, or only are colored while being illuminated by sunlight.  If the last of these, the compounds could just be fluorescing in UV, in which case a number of fluorescent dyes could probably be used.    UPDATE:  Unfortunately, cosmetics are exempted from MSDS requirements, and I cannot find an ingredients list.  The company posts some information about the science behind the color changes, but just say it is some organic compound.  The color change is also permanent, or nearly so.    Wikipedia has a list of chemicals that are used in photochromic inks.  I don't know which one(s) Del Sol uses, but it is probably one of these.

AA10335036	The opposing horizontal forces for the sphere at any angle are: Fg, proportional to m, and Felec, proportional to q. So at any angle of equilibrium, increasing q and m in the same proportion will not affect the equilibrium. Increasing q/m will increase the angle. Thus the list should be ranked in order of increasing q/m.  I think the order is 1, 5, 2&4 (tied), 6, 3, but you should check this.

Here is my "theory" on how we got into this mess with a stupid hoax:    ---    The whole thing began as astrologers noticed that a point called the winter solstice was crossing the Milky Way (and the Galactic equator).    Astrologers being those who believe that the sky runs our lives, decided that this "event" must mean something special. In a way, this is strange as astrologers have generally ignored the Galactic equator (being a recent invention, it was not part of the "classical" astrology).    So they made "New Age"-type predictions (a new chance for humanity, more peace, brotherly love among the nations, etc.).    Still, not much was made of it, because a lot of our Western Civilization "New Age" stuff is normally based on the Spring Equinox moving through the constellations (e.g., we are moving from the age of Pisces to the age of Aquarius).  We (western civilization) had no reason to pay attention to the Winter Solstice.    Until...    Later, someone found that the Mayans had a day-count calendar that reaches a round figure on a date somewhat in the general area of the "event" (even though the "event", described above, does not happen in 2012).    And this date, in the Mayan calendar, had a direct link with the Winter Solstice. On the day we call 2012.12.21, the Mayan calendar reaches the round figure 13.00.00.00.00 in their counting system.    This is not surprising, since the day of Winter solstice was, every year, New Year's Day for the Mayans. If you are setting up a calendar with an important round figure, you fix it so that it falls on New Year's Day. Big celebration. Lots of cake.    "Well", someone thought "this must be an important date that is linked with the event we described earlier". Because of the link to the Winter Solstice. This is where Jos came in to the act.    So the New Age predictions started again. Except, this time, some hoaxers got into it and decided to crank up the scare factor. (Some people just love to scare others, just for the fun of it)    This is when began the lies about the Mayan calendar "ending" (it does not) or the Mayans having predicted the end-of-the-world (they did not).    From that point on, there seemed to be a contest, which I have called the Big 2012 Hoax Off, as to who could come up with the biggest boldfaced lie and still get people to believe it.    All this had begun quite some time ago but we did not hear about it until the year 2000 had passed (Y2k -- the Year 2000 end-of-civilization -- had distracted us from these other lies).    ---    Meanwhile, another group had predicted the end-of-the-world for the year 2003. You see, there was to be this Planet X coming close to us, causing earthquakes, tsunamis, even pole flips.  "Nancy" had been told all this by some aliens from a planet around Zeta Reticuli (some star in the small constellation Reticulum).    Yeah! Right!    Charlatans associated with Nancy had a book for sale on how to survive the end-of-the-world of 2003.    Well, 2003 came and went, and many of us actually managed to survive the end-of-the-world... and we had not even bought their book.    So they revised the book, they changed the date to 2012 (already made popular by astrologers and by Jos). They added Nibiru and Nemesis (two more fictitious bodies) to their Planet X, and they created fake documentaries for YouTube and for television.    The matching 2012 "predictions" by Nostradamus, the Bible, the Egyptians and so on, were also created after 2003 (otherwise, they would have contradicted the 2003 end-of-the-world prediction).    You have to admit that the marketing is far better for 2012 than it was for 2003. A lot more people are talking about the 2012 end-of-the-world than they were about the 2003 end-of-the-world.

Copyright to me, and subject to improvement as   and when the inspiration strikes.|`|rROyFAMFaa	Well, since you're interested......................in the remnants of the Mayan calendar, from what scientists, philosophers, and people who study ancient civilizations have concluded, is  that the day of final reckoning will be upon us 12/21/2012. Also Nostradamus has also stated this in some of his ancient writings. This is a very pressing matter that seems to be upon that many don't believe in. I, being of mind and matter am just 13, and I will try to repent my sins just in case God comes for us. I try to change my behavior for I am smart just not well behaved by far. I do believe in this, it has to happen someday. Coincidence? Highly unlikely since the writings of Nostradamus and the Mayans were far apart in life, and I doubt any Mayan citizen ever read the writings of Nostradamus. This is inevitable, it if doesn't happen in 2012 it will happen later. We must repent our sins and hope God takes our soul into heaven. If we don't all die in 2012 something extraordinarily phenom-like will occur. Whether it is the second coming of the Messiah, or our "doomsday" theory something will happen. So, to all of you adults, repent, honor thy children as it says in the commandment honor thy parents. Please people, don't judge me, for I am just a 13   (almost 14) year old boy. If doomsday does occur, then I will just be a junior in high school. And to whoever said 12/12/2012 is wrong.

They were very advanced astrologers and chose this day because it is the same day the sun is in line with the center of the milky way galaxy. Essentially, it's like a new year for the sun orbiting the Milky way which happens every 25,000 years. The Mayans being good astrologers saw that. Despite crazy theories, the world is not going to end, Jesus is not coming back to Earth - nothing will happen other than the sun beginnig another 25000 year rotation around the Milky way. Nothing. Same thing that happened last time.|`|uueuW6IHaa	Well there are several theories. The main one being the end of the Mayan calender, which doesn't actually end, but goes into a new cycle. This has been interpreted several way. My personal theory is that, as you know we are made of energy along with everything else. Energy vibrates at a frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the state of consciousness. Once that cycle takes place, we collectively move to a higher frequency, or higher consciousness.         This could take place in several different way. Death of course one of them. The economy is getting so bad that the American dollar may fail and that would cause chaos all around the world. The government has already been preparing for this to happen. We now have whats called the Amero which is the new currency that will take over. go to youtube and look up the amero, and also videos about the NWO, collapse of the USA, and Martial law.     There is another theory i heard the other day. Scientist think that one of the stars in our solar system may have exploded and turned into a black hole.

Scientists don't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen in the year 2012, or specifically on the date December 21, other than the solstice, which happens every year.    None of the "predicted" happenings for 2012 hold up under close scrutiny. "Planet X" and "Nibiru" simply don't exist. The Mayan calendar ends a cycle, but there were no predictions of the end of the world. The Sun doesn't line up with the galactic centre; it's 6 degrees off. No asteroids or comets are actually predicted to hit Earth.    All of this stuff was put together by crackpots in order to promote their books and TV shows, and shamelessly promoted by the History Channel. Don't take any of it seriously!|`|BMEdL7lzaa	Hi,    The Mayans marked the year 2012 as the end of their CALENDAR not the end of the world. People have been looking for the end of the world to happen since it began, these predictions, all of them since the first one, which predates even the birth of Christ considerably, are merely humans attempt to deal with the concept of something that will exist beyond them because they are mortal. Another reason is merely extortion, there was one major occurance in medieval times when the Catholic Church announced an end date merely to cause peasants to donate what little wealth and assets they had in hopes of getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. Now in modern times we move to science for answers because we are slowly realizing that religion of any form or creed does not provide us with the answers we seek, so in essence science is becoming our new God, so needless to say we look to science for answers for everything including a date and time when the world ends. Unfortunatly however, as with any new mass movment in a cultured society, much ignorance is combined with what few facts we do have thus spreading mass rumor and in some cases, panic. The media, of course, milking it for all it is worth and selling it while it sells...that is why we are seeing increased programs on T.V. about doomsday scenarios, because thats the mindset of people right now, once 2012 blows over they will merely set the "End Date" back a few more years after all, werent we supposed to be royally doomed on the year 2000? So dont worry, if the world does end within the next 1,000 years, it will all be because of something humans did to themselves not some asteroid, or supernatural being, or outer space anomally we cannot control. In essence all I am saying is think about humans, humanity, even yourself, did'nt it used to be "The End" of the world when your mother would leave the room for a few moments when you were a child?|`|EvZLGHshaa	ok first and foremost the mayans never ever said that this would be the end of the world. just the end of an era. which dont meant anything close to the end of the world. it is also the day that the earth will be in alignement with the center of the milky way for the first time in about 26,000 years. there is a decent article about it on usatoday.com. @ http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/200...    i am so tired of hearing bout the world ending its crazy. the world was also supposedly going to end in 2000. and well here we are today 8 yrs later. ima laugh so hard when the "doomsday" is really here and nothing happens.
JwPu0XbIaa	A 'live' wire is not the same as a wire which has electrical current running through it.  'Live' usually just means the wire is at an electrical potential (a voltage) which would make it dangerous to handle.    However, if the wire was part of a circuit, and had current flowing through it, then the resistance of the wire (friction with the electrons moving through it) would create heat, and this heat would be soaked up by the water.  In this case, the water temperature would rise (though unless the current through the wire was large, you might never notice).
hHVMrnK3aa	You have two events, which I'll abbreviate as 'ate' and 'drank'.    The original statement says _both_ occurred (and).  In order for that to be false, only one has to "not happen", so we introduce the OR.    If one occurs and the other doesn't,   then it is _not_ the case that _both_ occurred.    Hence we end up with:  (not ate) OR (not drank)     - - - - -    The same thing works the other way:    If we say (ate) OR (drank) meaning one occurred,  the negation of that means that neither occurred,  so that would be (not ate) AND (not drank)  because we must exclude both by using And.|`|ZiDqFehcaa	You could use Boolean Algebra to see why this change to an "OR"  Let X be "The cat ate the food"  Let Y be "The cat did not drink water"  Then The negation of X = !X = "The cat did not eat the food"  Similarly, The negation of Y = !Y = "The cat drank the water"  The statement "The cat ate the food and the cat did not drivnk water" can be represented as:  X & Y  The negation of the statement is:  !(X & Y) which, using DeMorgan's is:  !X | !Y   where | stands for OR  Thus, "The cat did not eat the food" OR "The cat drank the water"|`|ZHSFyxqSaa	The cat did not eat the food and the cat drank the water|`|LeaUjOoUaa	Because the first statement was inclusive of both so the negation must be exclusive.

Survival in trauma is inversely correlated to the time it takes for the patient to arrive in a trauma center.     The Red Cross CPR model is best  1) Check the scene. Make sure it is safe for you to approach the victim.  2) CHeck the victim. Ask the victim to speak to you (in classic CPR fashion). "Annie! Are you okay?"  This confirms her level of consciousness, breathing and she will likely tell you or point out the injury.  3) Send someone to call 911. This happens before you intervene.  A) Check that the airway is clear  B) Check if she is breathing  C) check if she has a pulse  Here is a freee outline of Red Cross CPR:  .http://www.cprdude.com/cpr-adult.shtml  http://www.cprdude.com/cpr-child.shtml    If ABCs are all normal, identify any obvious bleeeding.

Further more: side lying against 30 degree angle equal half of a hypotenuse.    Using this two clues, since shortest side = 7 it is the opposite to 30 degree angle and hypotenuse = 14    Using the Pythagorean theorem find 3d side:    14^2 - 7^2 = 147 ---> sqrt147 = 12.12    The third side = 12.12|`|gxwF60jMaa	longer leg = 7/tan 30 = 7/(1/3) = 73  hypotenuse = 7/sin 30 = 7/(1/2) = 14|`|Moz2d806aa	you can use the law of sines:  7/sin(30)=x/sin(60)=y/sin(90)  so, one side is 12.1244 and the other side is 14. Smaller angles have the smaller opposite sides.
B5cuNTxQaa	Yes.    The driving force behind evolution is genetic mutation. Because human reproduction is so slow, it takes a very long time for genetic changes to become part of the general population. Everyone has many genetic differences in their DNA. You may know someone who has slightly misaligned toes, an ear shape that seems different or some other feature that is noticeably not in the general public. You may also notice when some of these traits are in several members of the same family. This is evolution in progress.    In smaller, faster reproducing animals the changes permeate the population more quickly. Bacteria reproduce several times a day and provide excellent examples of evolution. One major problem with pesticides and antibiotics is that the insects and bacteria quickly evolve to tolerate the chemicals.  .|`|pRF5LLloaa	You could say anything.

The next brightest star is all the way across the constellation. Beta Capricorni is a double star that lies just over 20 degrees west of Deneb Algedi. The brighter member of Beta Capricorni is Dabih at magnitude 3.05. (Dabih is an Arabic name that means "butchers".) It lies 344 light-years away. Beta 2 Capricorni is magnitude 6.09 and lies 313 light-years away. The two stars are separated by just three and a half arcminutes.  Another double star nearby is Alpha 1 and 2 Capricorni. Alpha 2 Capricorni also goes by the name Algedi. It is magnitude 3.58 and lies above the Beta Capricorni pair by a little more than two degrees. Alpha 1 is magnitude 4.3. The two stars are six arcminutes apart. Alpha 1 lies 686 light-years away and Algedi lies 108 light-years away.   Deneb Algedi, lies a star of decent brightness. At magnitude 3.69, Nashira is about two degrees from Deneb Algedi.

wNUAl1aaaa	I see the problem.  You are thinking that horizontal always = x, but here it doesn't because this problem involves 3 dimensions, x, y, and z.  Here "horizontal distance" means a line that is parallel to a horizontal plane (in this case the ocean).  19.6 km does point at an angle to the east-west direction, but it is parallel to the horizontal plane.  So you can't take it as the x-component, you have to break it up into its x and y components (but the x-y plane is a horizontal plane).|`|VkXv4RInaa	Sounds like you know what you're doing...     try using a horizontal distance from the radar station to the plane of 19.48km - the Horizontal distance it would be if the text actually meant the resultant distance. I have come across many misprints in text books.    Like you said, it may be a wording issue, so try 19.48 as the horizontal distance and see if it works    also, the difference between horizontal range and range, in my opinion would be that horizontal range is simply the x component and the range would be the resultant of horizontal range and elevation.    good luck|`|AA11440601	And do not forget the the world is a sphere (hence spherical geometry) and not a plane which may change things a bit.

I will write the the minors of the matrix (the 3x3 matrices formed by deleting that row and column) as A_i,j, and the determinant of any matrix M as |M|.    Then A^-1 =  [|A_1,1|, |A_1,2|, |A_1,3|, |A_1,4|]  [|A_2,1|, |A_2,2|, |A_2,3|, |A_2,4|]  [|A_3,1|, |A_3,2|, |A_3,3|, |A_3,4|]  [|A_4,1|, |A_4,2|, |A_4,3|, |A_4,4|]    So let's calculate some of these cofactors; I'll do the first row, and why don't you let me know if you can get the rest from there.  A_1,1 =  [1, 0, 1]  [2, 33, 6]  [8, 7, 9],  so |A_1,1| = 1(33*9-6*7)-0(2*9-6*8)+1(2*7-33*8) = 33*9-33*8-6*7+2*7 = 33(9-8) + (-6+2)7 = 33*1 - 4*7 = 33-28 = 5.  A_1,2 =  [0, 0, 1]  [7, 33, 6]  [3, 7, 9],  so |A_1,2| = 0(33*9-6*7)-0(7*9-6*3)+1(7*7-33*3) = 7*7 - 33*3 = 49 - 99 = -50.  A_1,3 =   [0, 1, 1]  [7, 2, 6]  [3, 8, 9],_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ // Don't forget to distribute this negative!  so |A_1,3| = 0(2*9-6*8)-1(7*9-6*3)+1(7*8-2*3) = -7*9+7*8+6*3-2*3 = 7(-9+8) + (6-2)*3 = 7*(-1) + 4*3 = -7 + 12 = 5  A_1,4 =  [0, 1, 0]  [7, 2, 33]  [3, 8, 7],  so |A_1,4| = 0(2*7-33*8)-1(7*7-33*3)+0(7*8-2*3) = -7*7 + 33*3 = -49 + 99 = 50.    So the first row of A^-1 looks like this:  [5, -50, 5, 50]    Did this make enough sense that you think you can do the rest yourself?

a1Iv39BLaa	Yes, I live under the illness of them most of the time. I've had morgellons from them. We all have barium poisoning and they call it the flu, yet it isn't contagious. It takes down your immune system. They crisscross the skies here like a checkerboard and instead of disappearing like contrails, they turn into manmade clouds. Anyone doubts me, my dad was in the Air Force. I think I know the difference between a contrail and chemtrails. Everytime those dose us pretty heavy, they have ads on the next day about our area having more strokes than our neighboring areas. Why? Barium thickens your blood. It also paralyzes your muscles, even your heart as it is a muscle. Many, many side effects. High blood pressure, too high a heartrate. Anxiety. Eventually death if something isn't done. Barium is just one of the heavy metals they put into the chemtrails. There is also human blood DNA that has been split for some reason, nanos, mold, you name it, it's in there, plus we are overladen with mercury from the coal burning power plants here. I want out of this area before it literally kills me. My family and I already have been through enough without this. Remember the anthrax after 9-11? Me and my family were infected with it. I received mail from Trenton, NJ and we were treated without ever a word said to us. We had anthrax. Now this sh!t!!! THe more I watch V the more I realize what we need to do to stop the poisoning of Americans. While we have numbers on our side that is.  100% you can hide your head and live in denial if you want. That's your choice, but you need to come live where I am and see how long before you're ill from this crap!! Believe the governments lies. That's your choice.

ecyYwLngaa	You were right with 27 going to 3.  Now, for x^9, the concept you need here is that x^a*x^b=x^(a+b)  Therefore the 3rd root of x^9 is simply x^(9/3)=x^3  Notice that x^3*x^3*x^3=x^(3+3+3)=x^9  Using what you had already figured out combined with this, we get the 3rd root of 27x^9 to be 3x^3.

bGPt8pj5aa	draw a vector for the plane's north direction and draw a vector for the wind's SE direction, so the angle between the N and SE should be 135 degrees    or better yet the North direction has only a positive y-component and no x-component, while the SE direction has a positive x-component and a negative y-component    so in terms of y-components: the plane is +250km/h, while the wind has 75cos 45 = 53.0km/h, its -53.0 since y-component is negative, so the sum of the y's is 197km/h    in terms of x-component: the plan has 0km/h, while the wind has 75sin45 = 53.0km/h, so the sum of the x's is 53.0km/h    so all together the vector of the plane after the additions will be pointing NE with coordinates (197, 53), and the resultant velocity would be using pythagorean theorm root(197^2+53^2)=204.0km/h    Hope this helps

0P6mAOk7aa	The "sum" of two vectors is uniquely determined by a + b = ab.  we have a + b = ab = ba = b + a and (a + b) + c = (ab)c = a(bc) = a + (b + c), so addition is commutative and associative.  The number 1 is the "zero" element since for all positive reals a, we have 1+a = 1a = a.  Finally, for every positive b, there is a "negative" 1/b such that b + 1/b = b(1/b) = 1, the "zero" element.<br>  <br>  For scalar multiplication, we have 0 X b = b^0 = 1, the additive identity.  [Note that while our "vectors" are the positive reals, our set of scalars are the whole set of reals, so the use of scalar 0 is allowed.]  We also have 1 X b = b^1 = b, and (-1)b = b^(-1) = 1/b, = -b, the additive inverse of b.  Moreover, k X (m X b) = k X b^m = (b^m)^k =<br>  b^(km) = (km) X b, so scalar multiplication is associative.  And k X (a + b) = k X ab = (ab)^k = (a^k)(b^k) = (k X a) + (k X b); and (k + m) X b \= km X b = b^(km) = (b^k)(b^m) = (b^k) + (b^m) = (k X b) + (m X b), and the distributive laws are satisfied.

A slope of 0.25 means that for, in this case, every 1 cup of coffee (x) that you sell the cost (C) for selling that day will go up $0.25    The only thing to do now is to place that slope in the equation, pick a known x and y (0, 50) or (5, 51.25) and solve for b. b turns out to be 50.    Then write the equation as y = 0.25x + 50 (this is your proof that it is a linear relationship)      Another way to prove it is to show the known values on an x,y graph and draw a line from point to point.  It should be a straight line if the relationship is linear.    It cost the vendor $50 dollars to sell no cups of coffee because they will have costs such as rent, paying other workers, electricity...etc. even if they don't sell anything that day.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Having shown that the slope = 0.25 means that C = 0.25x + 50.  This is a line.  Hence, the relationship is linear.    The $50 for zero cups is a fixed cost and the 0.25x is a variable cost.  That is, it costs you $50 to own or operate the cart whether or not you make any sales (hence fixed).  It costs you $0.25 per cup for each cup of coffee you sell.     Understand it this way.  You open a store.  Suppose the landlord buys all of your equipment and rents out the store to you at $1,000 per month.  If you make no sale, it still costs you $1,000.

If you live in Salt Lake City where they salt the roads and you have large salt flat deserts everywhere blowing around, that's going to affect your salinity. Speaking of deserts, if you live near one, that's the type of sediment that will be in your snow. If you live near buildings, then the type of sediments will probably be more silty gutter junk and bits of pavement. If you're in a pine forest where the soil is acidic, then you're sample will have less pH. If you live in a city with lots of buildings on the edge of a pine forest near a salt playa, you will have all three.

He waited a couple of minutes and . . . still nothing. He tried pushing but it kind of hurt. After a while a little poop came out, but it was small and hard, sort of like marbles.  James flushed, zipped up, and washed his hands. He didn't feel much better. Why? He was a little constipated.  What Is Constipation?  Constipation (say: con-stuh-pay-shun) is not having a bowel movement (pooping) as often as you usually do or having a tough time going because the poop is hard and dry. Normal poop is sort of soft and easy to pass, so it shouldn't be too hard to have a bowel movement.  When you poop, what ends up in the toilet is the last step of digestion (say: dye-jes-chun), a way started way back with the grilled cheese sandwich you had for lunch. After you chew and swallow food, it heads to your stomach. From there it's on to the small intestine (say: in-tes-tin), then the large intestine (or bowels), and finally out of the body through the rectum and anus.  All these parts make up your digestive system. As food moves through this system, your body soaks up water and nutrients it needs from the food. What's left over comes out as poop. Flush it and away it goes!  You probably don't think about this when you go to the bathroom. In fact, you may not think about what you do in the bathroom much at all. But when you're not going like you normally do, it may be on your mind a lot and you may feel uncomfortable.  Some people think they're constipated if they don't poop every day, but everybody's bathroom habits are different. One kid might go three times a day, and another kid might only go once every 3 days. So the real sign of whether you're constipated is if you're going less than you normally do.  What Are the Symptoms?  Besides not pooping as often as you usually do, you may feel full and have less of an appetite if you're constipated. Your belly may stick out a little, too. When you do go to the bathroom, you may feel like you have to work really hard to get the poop out, and it might hurt a little to go.  If your poop is hard and dry, pushing it out may cause tiny tears in the skin of your anus. If this happens, you might see a bit of blood on the toilet paper when you wipe. After you're done, you may have only gone a little and feel like you still have to go.  Sometimes when a kid's really constipated, some watery poop like diarrhea might leak out around the hard poop that's still inside. This can cause a messy accident, even for kids who stopped having accidents a long time ago.  If you think you're constipated, or if you see blood on the toilet paper after you wipe, tell your parents. It's probably no big deal, but it's a good idea to let them know what's going on.  How Is It Treated?  If you're constipated you probably won't need any special treatment. Chances are you'll soon start going regularly again on your own. If your doctor decides you should come in for a visit, he or she might suggest some medicine or a change in diet to get you going. But don't take any medicine for your constipation unless your doctor recommends it.  Other than some medicine, the doctor might order an X-ray or other types of tests that check out your digestive system. But usually constipation is just constipation. You eventually poop and feel better."|`|sltw4YeIaa	OK, so first you have to do 10 times 30.

I hope this makes sense!|`|09e4e2864185cdee89ab5d68962decf2aa	First question implies only the percent consumption of the elephant to its food. Just divide 150 to 5000kg.    Second question, considering the two to be running at the same direction, their rates may oppose. But at this point it can be represented as this:    x + (x + 8) = 46; therefore, 2x + 8 = 46.    For the third question: use proportion: 25:5 = 20:x    Simplifying the proportion, the answer is about 4 kg.|`|435npiVnaa	150/5000=3%    r=x  s=8+x  s+x=46  (the 3 above equations are my train of thought)    46-8=2x  46=2x+8  __  |C|  ***|`|Tng8WuL9aa	first i don't know    2     answer is C    third    It will be 4kg    because you said that apples weight 5 kg for one apple it will be 5/25 it will be 0.2    for 20 apple it will be 20*0.2 so answer will be 4 Kg    http://themonster.in
VjbJYqSPaa	Combined nitrate + nitrite a measure of inorganic nitrogen, the sum of nitrates and nitrites. Both are essential plant nutrients but can cause algal overgrowth in excess amounts. Fertilizer, sewage leaks and decomposing plant material all contribute to combined nitrogen levels in aquatic environments. The state criterion for combined nitrogen in a healthy water body is .008 mg/L. All of the data collected from Enchanted Lakes gave combined readings that far exceeded the state criteria figure. All of the sites that were analyzed are located in heavily populated residential areas and are subject to fertilizer-rich runoff. This could explain the high combined nitrogen levels collected over the study period.

73etrYBqaa	Oooh tricky!    Since complex zeroes come in pairs there is another root implied, the complex conjugate of 2+3i which is 2-3i  So you have 3 roots 2/3, 2+3i and 2-3i  we just need one more, and it must be real since only one root remains and there is no other complex root. I'll call it r  f(x)=(x-2/3)(x-(2+3i))(x-(2-3i))(x-r)  To find the missing root, put in f(x)=-288, and x=2 and solve.  Then multiply everything out and that's it!    I let mathematica do the dirty work for me, got r=26    End result:  f(x)= x^4 - (92 x^3)/3 + 137 x^2 - 416 x + 676/3

a4kTbjfeaa	Each hospital has its own protocol in determining brain death. In the hospital I work in the patient needs to be examined by a qualified physician who determines that the patient is likely brain dead. Once this is documented in the chart a neurologist or neurosurgeon examines the patient. If this examination qualifies the patient as brain dead it is documented and one more clinical exam is done 12 hours after that exam. If both exams show brain death then the patient is declared.   Brain death is a clinical diagnosis. It is not necessary to perform an EEG or CT/MRI. Clinical abscence of brainstem function (absent gag reflex, absent corneal reflexes, absent pupillary response, absent respiratory drive etc) is enough to make a diagnosis of brain death.   Again each hospital may have a slightly different variation as to the protocol.|`|fyA4uL6Taa	Theres no amount of time.As soon as the doctor determines theres no brain activity...he can declare the person brain dead.But i have herd something like if the person was a orgon donnor they have to be on life support 12 hours or something before they can give organs|`|98OlWbtXaa	Brain death is usually determined based on a scan of the brain waves.  It only takes as long as it takes to do the scan to determine this.  If there is no brain wave activity, the person is "brain dead".

I hope you're not having to go through this with a friend or family member.  If so, I'm sorry :(

You can buy things to eat/drink before the test that allow you to pass. There are also different things you can buy that you can place in the sample that will cover up anything that would cause you to fail.  Head shops are good because you will be able to talk straight up with the employees about your specific situation, and not feel embarrassed.

CuJbctfsaa	She could put the ivy plants in two separate containers, and control the amount of heat, water, etc. that they receive, and put one on a hot plate on low heat (so it didn't kill the plant), and put the other one in an ice bath or something.  She'd have to measure the temperatures and length (since it's ivy, she couldn't really measure height) with a measuring tape.

TuJqS5A3aa	With those side lengths, CB has to be at least 100, because otherwise the sides wouldn't form an actual triangle. Also, the longest sides in a triangle are directly across from the largest angles.    Think about a triangle with side lengths 100, 100, and 1. The angle across from the shortest side (in this case, the point of the isosceles triangle) would be tiny, right? In this case, we can determine that the tiny angle is C, because the shortest side is AB. The only angle in triangle ABC that is directly opposite side AB is angle C, hence it is the shortest.    I hope this helps! =]|`|CI5qOBcDaa	AC would have to be equal to something more than 1. And the opposite angle from the smallest side, is the smallest angle, therefore the angle opposite of AB would be the smallest and if you drew a picture than angle would be C.|`|RrvJ99uaaa	Think of side AC (length not given) as having measure x.    By the Triangle Inequality Theorem, one side of a triangle must be less than the sum of the other two but greater than their difference.    Therefore, x     Also, x > 100 - 1 or x > 99    Writing the constraints on x as a compound inequality,    99     In a triangle, the smallest angle is opposite the smallest side. In this example, side AB with length 1 is the smallest side and the angle opposite it, Angle C is the smallest angle of the triangle.

BhumxInEaa	Because both go up as N and not N^2, ln N, e^N, etc.    The whole point of big O notation is to ignore constant so you can focus on the big picture - what happens when N gets very large.    For example, for large enough N kn is going to be bigger than square root of N and smaller than N^2 no matter how large or small k is (as long as k is constant). The value of k affects the cross-over point, but it does not affect what happens as N gets "large enough"    For another example, normal matrix multiplication is O(N^3) multiplications. For a 2 x 2 matrix, this is 8 multiplications and 8 additions.    Strassen's algorithm is O(N^2.807). It requires only 7 multiplications, but more additions and subtractions than the usual method, and it is more complex. But because multiplications are more expensive than additions, using Strassen's algorithm (in a carefully tuned program) pays off when N is greater than about 100.    Then there is the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm which is O(N^2.376). But the constant value is so large that it only makes sense when N is larger than any current computer can handle. But wait a while, computers will get bigger, and it will pay to use the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_mult...    This isn't to say that people do not care about the constant. There are a number of sorting routines with a worst-case performance of O(N lg N) with constants that vary by a factor of 2. All other things being equal, which they never are, you will clearly want to choose the one with a lower constant.

When doing conversion of units, you should always keep all the units in every step, don't just write down the numbers.  In this case, here's a foolproof way to get the answer:    1.  Note that 1m = 100cm, therefore 1m/100cm = 1    2.  (1m/100cm)^3 also equals 1    3.  You can multiply 50cm^3 by (1m/100cm)^3, since you're just multiplying by 1    4.  Do the multiplication:      50cm^3 * (1m/100cm)^3 = 50 * .01^3 = .00005m^3    5.  You know the final units are m^3, because cm^3 in the above equation appears in both the numerator and denominator, and cancels out.    Writing out all the units this way helps avoid errors.  For example, if you had multiplied by 100cm/1m instead of 1m/100cm, the final units wouldn't come out right, and you would know you've done something wrong.

That equals 11.    How do you figure the answer is 6, if you don't know how to solve it?    Hope this helps. =)|`|L9I3z0fLaa	Pointy's answer uses the correct formula.  The other methods offered simply average the three numbers, but this is the wrong method because it does not take into account that average speed must account for the varying times involved at each speed.     When doing a simple average, you count each number one time.  However, average speed is a weighted average, meaning that while you have 3 numbers (3, 20, 10), these numbers are not counted an equal number of times.  This is because it takes longer to cover the same distance when going slower, and the longer time gives that slower speed more weight, which needs to be a part of the calculation.     An equal weighting for calculating speed would mean that swim at 3 km/hr for 1 MINUTE, biked at 20 km/hr for 1 MINUTE, then ran at 10 km/hr for 1 MINUTE.  But in reality, you swim at 3 km/hr for 1 KM (20 minutes), 20 km/hr for 1 KM (3 minutes), and 10 km/hr for 1 KM (6 minutes).    Using this example you can calculate the weighted average...    First, take the speed for each leg, then multiple it by the time needed to complete that leg of the race (using a 1 km distance for each leg of the race in this example):   (3 km/hr * 20 minutes) + (20 km/hr * 3 minutes) + (10 km/hr * 6 minutes) = 60 + 60 + 60 = 180.    Next, figure out the total of the weighted numbers (the time at each speed): 20 + 3 + 6 = 29.    Last, divide the total number from the first step and divide by the total of the weighting values: 180/29 = 6.21
Wcjc8Au1aa	The expression"absolute value" is usually used only with real numbers.  But it's not really incorrect to use it for complex numbers as well.  When you do use it for complex numbers, it means the same as 'magnitude' or 'modulus.'  There's no technical difference among those terms; it's just a matter of what the customary terminology is for the group of people you're communicating with.|`|VLT2VgP9aa	Absolute value is a way of describing distance. Specifically, if a is a real number, then |a| is the distance between a and zero.  Also, if a and b are both real numbers, then |a - b| is the distance between them.    Graphically, the real numbers are represented by a line, so distance is easy to compute.  The complex numbers, however, are represented by a plane.  In order to preserve the idea of absolute value representing distance, it needs to be defined in a way that is appropriate for this two dimensional setting.  Specifically, if z = a + bi is a complex number, we want |z| to be the distance between z and the origin.  Applying the Pythagorean Theorem shows that this distance is given by sqrt(a^2 + b^2).  So, we define the absolute value of a complex number z in this way.
s5X71mhyaa	When you're working on music and you want to add some nice room ambiance to a vocal track that you recorded dry, you add reverb. But when you're in a large room and you hear your own voice distinctly coming back to you, you call it echo,    Reverb and echo are two different things. Here are the technical definitions of each:    Reverb is characterized as random, blended repetitions of a sound occurring within thirty milliseconds after the sound is made. This is all the sound that immediately bounces off any nearby surfaces before it gets back to your ears. So first you'll hear the original sound and then all the stuff bouncing off the walls, furniture, trees, people, giraffes and even acoustic tiling. Your brain is specially equipped to notice reverberations before your conscious perception does. It blends the reverb with the original sound before you even notice it and then tells you that it all came from the same location, just so you don't get confused. Weird, huh? With enough practice though, you can turn off this feature and notice the reverb that occurs in every space. Snap your fingers, or as I do, make a sharp clicking sound with your mouth, and try to listen to the room around you instead of yourself. You'll start to hear it. Try it in different rooms. It'll sound different each time.     Echo is defined by distinct repetitions of a sound occurring after 30 milliseconds. This is when you can unquestionably hear a distinct... well, echo of a sound coming back to you. When you are at a big canyon or inside a gigantic room and you, of course, say "Hello!" and then a moment later you hear it again, that's echo. For some reason, in the world of music production, it's called 'delay'. The term 'echo' is, to my knowledge, never used. What's wrong with 'echo'? I have no idea.    To put it this way:  - reverberation for example makes the music instrument sound like it is played in closed room/stadium/hall/garage  - you hear echo when you go to Grand Canyon or very large room and you yell "hello" and then you hear hello hello hello ello ello llo llo oo oo o o o. :)

b1ceb7c8481526a9137bbf36ef3f74aaaa	First, calculate the kinetic energy of one electron before it encounters the plate.  Then calculate the work that the plates will do on the electron.  Finally, add that work to the electron's initial kinetic energy, and use that new kinetic energy to calculate the electron's final speed.<br>  <br>  The electron's initial kinetic energy is 0.5*m*(v_0)^2, where m is the mass of an electron and v_0 is its initial speed.  The work done on the electron will be q*V, where q is the charge on an electron and V is the potential difference between the plates.  Because the electron is moving from the negative plate to the positive plate, this will be positive work.  The electrons final kinetic energy will then be 0.5*m*(v_0)^2 + q*V, but it can also be rewritten as 0.5*m*(v_f)^2, where v_f is the electron's final velocity and your only unknown.<br>  <br>  The final equation is 0.5*m*(v_0)^2 + q*V = 0.5*m*(v_f)^2, where v_0 and V are given, and m and q are known physical constants.|`|EOqxenK9aa	The electrons either gain or loose 40eV of energy. Let's see which: they enter at the negative side, they are pulled towards the positive plate. Thus they gain the energy.<br>  <br>  E = E0 + 40eV<br>  <br>  E0 - initial kinetic energy<br>  E - final kinetic energy<br>  <br>  From E you will get the final velocity.<br>  <br>  You can look up all the equations and needed constants on wikipedia.

For a problem like this, you can get rid of the last two zeros, but I would suggest just leaving them on to make things easier. What you need to do is set up a normal equation with the 800 outside of the division bracket and 300 on the inside. Next, just add a zero to the number inside the bracket (300) and make a decimal in the answer area between the second and third zeroes of the 300. Then you are left with 3000/800 with a decimal so then just finish the problem like usual and you should get .375 for the answer, and then multiply by 100. <br>  <br>  I know this is hard to explain without being able to draw the division bracket, but hopefully it helps.

6c2be2f9234ae63b1e07a17e279442ceaa	As the car follows the road, centripetal force is required for the car and all its contents to follow that circular path. Remember, objects in motion tend to stay in motion in a straight line. Newtons said so. It takes centripetal force, I use the variable name Fc, to bend the velocity vector so the object follows a circular path. In this case, that Fc is provided by a portion of the weight of the particular object under consideration. So the passenger's normal weight is not all going to compression of the springs in the seat -- some go to providing the required Fc.<br>  <br>  The formula is<br>  Fc = m*v^2/r<br>  The remainder of the passenger's weight can be considered "apparent weight".
