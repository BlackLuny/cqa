With a pay check of 11 hours you may not have reached the level to get any money with held. If you are going to be working 11 hours each pay period you may need to have additional money with held. The W4 planner is just that a planner and often it is not correct. Keep watching your pay stubs and adjust your W4 if required. If you should work a second job then the W4 will not be accurate as the one employer doesn't know about the other. <br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

cu8fUJbMaa	Graduated in 1986 and remained in the field until 2005. I LOVED my job for many years but left mainly because I was just burnt out. The pluses for me were that I could work 3- 12 hr shifts and get paid for 40 hrs., I loved helping and caring for people and getting to know them and their families, it was intellectually challenging on a lot of levels, there was constant change so you never suffer from boredom, my coworkers were awesome men and women, etc. As far as being rewarding, I would say absolutely. When I went home at the end of a shift I left confident that I made a difference in the lives of every patient I touched. It's a good feeling to know that when someone is at their worst you have done everything you can help heal them, even if all you could do was provide a gentle human touch and kindness when there was no one else to do that. The greatest challenges for me were under staffing, which means you have more patients and less time for each of them, and of course the loss of any patient is upsetting. Respect?  From most people, yes. There are always the old-school doctors that don't respect or appreciate what we did for their patients and who treated us poorly and of course the patients and their family members who saw as as their personal maid rather than a professional there to provide care.I think to be a good nurse you need to have compassion, a genuine desire to help and a LOT of patience and understanding, the ability to think clearly & calmly and act/react quickly and calmly and a nature that allows you to deal with stress and not let it get to you.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	a lot of hard work and dedication. <br>  its very rewarding<br>  you face challenges everyday, you have to deal with a lot of pts, visitors,  doctors, nurses and different personalities<br>  most time i feel respected. but then you have some pts, doctors, family members and nurses that dont respect. some reasons are they fell because youre new, you dont know what youre doing, or because you look young or because youre a woman<br>  a caring and compassionate heart, plus lots of patience

Why would you want to list Ohio as your state of residence when Tennessee has no state income tax?<br>  <br>  To give you a real world situation, why would the State of Ohio refund you money out of their coffers if (and this is if Tenn. had personal income tax) your employer withheld state income tax and paid this withheld tax to the State of Tennessee?<br>  <br>  This is exactly why every state asks you "Where did you live" type questions on every state tax return.
DGFu03Q3aa	Dear Squeaker:  I believe you are talking about your w-4 that you file at work and you have it set up so that you are having a little too much withheld from each pay check. It has been my experience that people that have too much withheld are in a better position on April 15th than the other way.  By nature it seems it is harder to put away money from each paycheck to pay your income tax on April 15th so I think your approach is a good one. <br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

Some people prefer to have more taken out of each check and then receive a few thousand as an IRS refund in April as a sort of "forced savings".  Other people don't like giving the government an interest free loan on their money so they have an accountant do the work to compute the correct amount to withhold each check so they come very close to owing nothing and receiving nothing back.  You can even owe up to $1,000 at year-end without paying any penalties.

ZFo3XOURaa	Wow, there is a lot of bad information out there concerning the tax credit. If you bought a home prior to January 1st 2009 you will be allowed to take a credit on your taxes of $7500, but this money will have to be paid back over a 15 year period. This assumes that you are a first time home buyer.<br>  <br>  The $8,000 tax credit that just got signed into law this last week is available to first time home buyers and does not have to be paid back as long as you live (claim the home as your primary residence) in the home for 3 years. A first time home buyer that purchases a home between January 1st 2009 and December 31 2009 will be eligible for this tax credit. There are income limits on this tax credit where you would no longer be able to claim the credit. If you are single and make less than $75,000 a year you will be entitled to the entire credit. If you make more than $75,000 a year you will have this credit reduced for each set dollar increment you exceed $75,000. If you are a couple and file a joint return then the income limits are $150,000 and $170,000. <br>  <br>  In plain english since you are a first time home buyer and make 60K a year you will be eligible to get 8K as a sort of gift from the government that off sets your tax liability. So, if you paid 9K in taxes for 2009 and it was determined that this was the correct amount of taxes you owed then you would get a tax return of 8K that you will not have to pay back as long as you live in the home you bought for 3 years. If you do not live in the home for 3 years then you would have to pay back some part of the credit and a CPA can help you wth that item.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	This is just a interest free loan that you can take to help put as part of a down payment on your house. You can borrow all or some of it. But you have to pay it back over three years. It just brings down the total price of the house by how much  you want to borrow. It isn't free money. We are in the same boat, about to buy a house. But we won't need to use it...just another bill to have to pay.
AA11284831	It's a GREAT deal if you're wealthy. If you're poor or middle class it will clean your clock.<br>  <br>  Answer the following questions, please. If you can, you will be the FIRST "Fair Tax" proponent to do so! I've yet to have a single one of them address them, including Neil Boortz who hung up on me on his radio show and called me an idiot. I've interspersed my own commentary on the issues but feel free to tear it up with FACTUAL information -- platitudes are worthless.<br>  <br>  1. If you are going to do away with the IRS, who will collect the tax. (It will still be the IRS, we'll just give them a sweet sounding name.)<br>  <br>  2. How do you intend to deal with "prebate" fraud? (The IRS can't track income in real time -- it takes about 18 MONTHS to match W-2s with tax returns in the SAME computer system -- so how will they (or whomever) track family composition in real time?)<br>  <br>  3. With a 30% tax on ALL new goods, how do you intend to deal with the massive black marketing that will result. (Any city or state with high tobacco or alcohol taxes will tell you that black marketing is a REAL problem.)<br>  <br>  3a. OK, Congress dealt with that with tax stamps like on liquor and tobacco. (How about "The Audit of the New Millenium" now as armies of IRS agents decend on neighborhoods on trash day looking for evidence of untaxed goods. Or worse yet, burst into your home and rummage through your dresser looking for untaxed gruns and sex toys?)<br>  <br>  4. How do you intend to deal with financing of the $60,000 tax on a new $200,000 home -- a modest price in much of the nation? (The home is still only worth $200,000 so the lenders won't lend the extra $60,000.)<br>  <br>  4a. How will you deal with the collapse of the construction industry that will result from #4. (The resale market will take off, but new construction will grind to a hault.)<br>  <br>  5. Ditto for the $6,000 tax on a new $20,000 car. (Same as #4.)<br>  <br>  5a. How will you deal with the collapse of the auto industry in the US as a result of #5. (Before long US roads will look like Cuba with ancient pollution-belching relics being pushed along far past their sell-by dates.)<br>  <br>  4b & 5b combined. Now that the US economy itself has collapsed following the collapse of its two primary movers, what next? (I'd LOVE to hear their answers on this!)<br>  <br>  6. While you claim that the manufactureres of goods and the providers of services will reduce their prices due to the lack of corporate taxes, how to you plan on ensuring that that actually happens? (Sounds like quasi-communisim with central control on prices. Shudder!) <br>  <br>  6a. And what about corporations that are bleeding money like Ford and GM and pay no income taxes since they're LOSING money. Where will THEIR price cuts come from??  THEIR costs will actually RISE as money spent on infrastructure investment will be taxed so their prices will RISE substantially.  Uh-oh, Houston we have a problem!<br>  <br>  7. How to you explain to the single mother with 2 kids that the EIC that she was depending upon for basic survival is being replaced by the "prebate" BUT she'll now pay about $5,400 in taxes that she didn't have to pay before? (Virtually every penny she earns pays for essential goods and services. She'll be cruicified by the added tax burden as she doesn't pay any income taxes now but WILL pay heavily under the co-called "Fair Tax.")<br>  <br>  8. How do you plan to deal with the outcry from the World Trade Organization as untaxed American goods flood the global markets, shutting out imports in the US and local products overseas? (Hmmm... Go back to corporate income taxes? Whoops! There goes a prime argument for the "Fair Tax!")<br>  <br>  9. How will you deal with the Paris Hiltons, Steve Forbeses, Bill Gateses (insert favorite rich person's names 1,500 times) who will simply make their major purchases overseas and bring them into the US as used and therefore tax-free. (Remember the failed Luxury Tax from the 80s that put yacht dealers out of business in droves and tossed their employees onto the unemployment and welfare lines.)<br>  <br>  10. Finally, how to you explain to the middle class taxpayer earning $50,000 per year with a family of 4 and paying almost no income tax that he now has to pay $10,000 in taxes MORE than his "prebate" amount? (I'd love to hear that one too!)<br>  <br>  I could go on for hours on the unintended consequences of the grossly misnamed "Fair Tax" but my fingers are getting tired. In the end it's a SWEET deal for the wealthy (who tend to amass wealth, not spend it all) but would crucify the poor and bring the middle class to their knees. The economists who dreamed this up have no focus on the social impact of this and were told to ignore any impact other than the bottom line for the US government. Hardly "Fair" IMHO.<br>  <br>  The ONLY "good" tax is a graduated income tax. It's the ONLY tax that adheres to the first rule of taxation: Make sure that the taxpayer can AFFORD to pay the tax. <br>  <br>  The wealthy support the misnamed "Fair Tax" (or the Flat Tax) since they'd pay MUCH less in taxes. If you lessen the burden on one group you either must cut services or transfer the burden to another group. That leaves the poor and middle class to shoulder the burden of a tax cut for the wealthy. Sorry, but I flatly refuse to subsidize your next BMW!|`|d0836e0785bb7c6faea2b62558249361aa	I would only agree with the Fairtax if it was on a sliding scale, where the more expensive the item, the higher the tax on it.<br>  <br>  That way the mega rich will still be putting in their fair share.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and there shouldn't be a tax on food or clothing  items under $50.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	It has been an idea that has been rejected for 95 years.|`|8P1yz9t0aa	Cause our government is all screwed up|`|snh9wzpnaa	Because a sales tax punishes poor people and the government will never do that, especially with a liberal white house and both houses of congress liberal.<br>  <br>  As it stands, a family of four with $24000 of income pays no income tax and actually gets all of their withholdings back plus an earned income credit of $3090 and an additional child tax credit of $2000.  In other words, they get all of their withholdings back plus over $5000 extra.<br>  <br>  Under your consumption tax, they would pay tax on every one of those 24000 dollars plus they wouldn't get that extra $5000 tacked on.<br>  <br>  You might feel that they aren't entitled to a free ride plus $5000, but that would be because you never had to try to raise a family on $24000.  Right now they do it on $29090.  You would have them trying to do it on $21600 (assuming a 10% sales tax).  Good luck raising those kids on that.<br>  <br>  I agree that filling the tax gap would be great.  Not only all the illegal aliens paying tax, but also those working for cash or making other undocumented money.  But you need to find a plan that doesn't starve working people who happen to be in low paying jobs.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	Because it wouldn't work.<br>  <br>  If you think that the economy is bad now, try adding an extra 30% sales tax to everything.<br>  <br>  The grossly misnamed "Fair"tax died with Mike Huckabee's presidential campaign.

1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	I began working as a student nurse technician several months before I graduated from nursing school, and then I was guaranteed a nursing position as soon as I became a GN. <br>  <br>  Honestly, no matter where you want to work, I don't think you'll have any problem finding a job in nursing. The hiring around here has slowed down considerably, but graduate nurses are still able to find full-time employment. <br>  <br>  If you are currently a nursing student, I recommend that you find a job as a student nurse tech or CNA. That will greatly increase your chances and ease your transition into working as a GN.<br>  <br>  I graduated in March of 03 and took the NCLEX in April. You apply for licensure first, then you submit your application for the NCLEX. When you apply for the NCLEX, you receive your Authorization to Test (ATT) and then you can schedule the date and time with your local testing center. <br>  <br>  It sounds complicated, but it's not that bad. <br>  <br>  For information about the test itself, see this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allnursingschools.com/faqs/nclex.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.allnursingschools.com/faqs/nc...</a>|`|cu8fUJbMaa	No time at all. I graduated in 1986 and while I know that was some time ago (LOL) I don't think things have changed that much. Right now there is a nursing shortage in many areas and you pretty much have your pick of where you want to work. Most hospitals are offering great sign on bonuses!|`|gImfT3a8aa	I don't know much; but I do know that you can start an internship after one year of school. I think this ensures you a job there afterwords.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	depends on who is hiring|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	I had a job before I even graduated. If you graduate in May, for example, you should start applying for jobs in March if you're serious about starting work right away. This is what I did. I had 4 interviews during early May and had several job offers before graduation. <br>  <br>  I can't speak for Tennessee, but some areas of the country are laying off RNs right now and the climate is not as favorable. You should still be able to find a job, but you might have trouble getting into a hospital or clinic and you might have to start off in home health or a nursing home. If you try hard enough and aren't picky, you will still find a job. Once you have some experience in any setting as an RN, you will have a much easier time finding work in an area of your choosing. The job climate always changes. There may be layoffs due to the recession right now, but it's temporary. Health care is a supply and demand business, and people don't get healthier when there is a poor economy. So the nurses will be called back after their layoffs once the hospitals start realizing they can't continue to give good patient care on a skeleton staff.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	immediately. but that all depends on where you want to work. there are clinics, nursing homes, hospitals, doctotrs office and prision. its your choice

6007c88d58a75c325b5d506b82ff3719aa	Why don't you save up for a "rainy day". The sole purpose of money isn't necessarily to spend it, but to make it available if you want/need to spend it. If you make money, and spend all of what you make, how will you ever be prepared if you lose your job? If you wish to take a vacation? Invest for your future? You need to start somewhere - even if you only saved $30 of your $90/week, you're still talking about ~$1500/year. Not bad at all to start. Build some assets: be proud of your growing net worth - especially if you have the gadgets and accessories you want - not your debt. You'll be happier - and probably breathe easier, too, when you hear friends complaining about not having enough money...|`|Ch9TedMcaa	a savings account

OfPQVR1Naa	The generic answer is dress Business Casual.<br>  <br>  but....<br>  <br>  <br>  The people who will be in the booths at the job fair are usually actual employees of the company they represent.  Normally HR personnel, but sometimes a member of lower management will attend, too.  <br>  <br>  My point is, treat this initial meeting as though it were actually a job interview.  From the moment you approach the table you will be assessed.  Your appearance, your personality, your hand shake, from these three things the company representatives will decide if they want to pursue you as an employee or not.<br>  <br>  Job fairs are a huge advantage for employers because it allows them to meet perspective employees without the ground-work of checking resumes.  Even a perfect resume does not ensure a position... employers want to know you will be a good fit personality wise.  The best employee is the one that gets along with everyone, shows up for work on time, and gets the job done.  In that order.  I know it sounds backwards, but more money is wasted dealing with coworker "issues" than anything else.<br>  <br>  So...   Dress for the Job.  Smile.  Look the reps in the eyes and shake their hands firmly and briskly.  Remove "I guess" and "maybe" from your vocabulary.  The proper answers to their questions are "Yes!", "No, but I'm a fast learner!", "I'm very flexible", and "I get along well with everyone" (these are gold).  <br>  <br>  Have some questions prepared to ask them.  If they are interested, they will ask you if you have any questions for them, and having questions is a good thing.  Ask how much overtime you can expect to get each month.  Ask what the pay cycle is (weekly, bi-weekly, etc).  Ask about bennefits (401k, medical, dental, retirement).<br>  <br>  Bring copies of your resume, but wait until they ask for it.  If they are interested, they will ask.  If not, then they won't.  This will let you know, before you walk away from their booth, if you are going to get called-in for an interview.<br>  <br>  So dress for the job you want.|`|tBUG9DEfaa	If you're attending a job fair in the financial or legal industry hosted at Dodger Stadium, then wear a full suit.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for seasonal work during baseball season at Dodger Stadium, a buttoned dress shirt with slacks will do.

1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	If you have to pay for your education out of pocket, I totally understand why you'd want to do the shorter and more affordable LPN program first! A lot of people do the LPN to RN transition, and programs are making more flexible hours to accommodate working nurses. <br>  <br>  But before you decide, check into some hospital schools and find out whether they have a tuition reimbursement program. My nursing school tuition was paid for because I had a contract to work within the health system for 2 years after graduation. I just paid for books and fees. Then when I went back for my BSN, my employer paid for most of that. I don't have any school loans to pay off. <br>  <br>  You may want to consider school loans, but that's a personal choice and you may not want to be in debt. <br>   <br>  But also find out if there are any grants available to you, or scholarships! Maybe there's help available that you weren't aware of before.. <br>  <br>  I'd recommend a hospital school or community college over going straight to a four-year BSN program. You could always get your ADN or Diploma now, and let your employer pay for your BSN. That way you could avoid having to shell out all that money to cover the overinflated costs of a four-year college.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider the wage difference. If you can live on an LPN's wage, then it might be the best option for you right now. Wages vary based on the region and the type of facility. <br>  <br>  You could be in the workforce sooner with your LPN, and it's really only another year and you could have your RN, as long as you go straight through school while you're working.<br>  <br>  I hope I haven't confused you more! LOL. I wanted to offer some advice and opinions, but now I see that there are pros and cons to each choice. I see why you need help deciding. <br>  <br>  Either way, be assured that you're going into a great career that offers potential for advancement, whether you start out as an LPN or an RN. <br>  <br>  Best wishes! :)|`|9a3sNrEqaa	go for your RN.You can always get a job in the participating hospital as a student nurse after your first semester!

y0tD4JKUaa	Five years is a long time. And if you study economics you will realise about something called inflation. If you earned 50USD way back in 1995 and you still have that amount in year2000 would have the same buying power as you used to have? So of course the answer is no. If you wish go on the same job with no raise for five long years you are putting on yourself on a leash for no reason but genuine lack of economic knowledge and financial smarts. Tell you what go on some online course and perk up your skills you will find great opportunities out there waiting for you to catch them.|`|tBUG9DEfaa	No.<br>  <br>  1.  If you're not getting a raise, even a minor one, your salary is not keeping up with inflation.  The cost of living will go up when your salary remains stagnant.  You're gradually making less in the 5 years you're in the contract.<br>  <br>  2.  5 years is a LONG time.  You may receive a better job offer in the next five years or decide you want to do something completely different.<br>  <br>  3.  If you're in the same job for the 5 years, you're not advancing in your career.  Future employers may want to see a career progression in those 5 years.  If this company is giving you increased responsibilities with the same pay, then you're undervalued.|`|P87DeizZaa	Absolutely not!!  Remember, a contract is a two way street.  Life can throw you a ton of curve balls in five years.  I would think long and hard before doing something like this.|`|6Z49DZaRaa	No. If I had to work at my job for even one more year, I wouldn't do it.|`|vA7Iq6FSaa	No, because inflation is going to go WAY WAY WAY up, and I don't want to be making 25$ and hour when a gallon of milk is 50$ dollars.|`|4f51ca5e733afd3aff18667f295ba3c6aa	Definitely not it's like working without progress.

1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	I became a psychiatric nurse straight out of nursing school... From there I changed career paths and ultimately ended up in med/surg. But anyway, I really loved psychiatric nursing and I wish you the best if that's the career you'd like to pursue! <br>  <br>  So you have a few options. To become a nurse, you can go to a community college and get an Associate's Degree, a hospital school and get a Diploma of Nursing, or a four-year college and get a Bachelor of Science in Nursing. I went to a hospital school and went back for my BSN later. <br>  <br>  That decision is entirely up to you. Hospital schools may have a psychiatric ward or an affiliation with a local psychiatric hospital, and sometimes they pay most or all of your tuition in exchange for a service obligation. So not only could you get free tuition, but a guaranteed job as well! It's something for you to look into; I can't guarantee that any particular option is available in your area. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that eventually you will need your Bachelor's degree to advance further in your career; many nurses opt for the four-year schools for that reason. <br>  <br>  No matter which type of nursing school you choose, you'll have to complete pre- or co-requisite classes before you get into the real "meat & potatoes" of nursing school. <br>  <br>  Before starting at my nursing school, I had to take Microbiology, Anatomy and Physiology I&II, Psychology, and Human Growth and Development. If you haven't earned AP or CLEP credits, you will probably also need Biology I and II, Algebra, English 101 and 102, and at least 1 Chemistry. The pre-requisites depend upon the school, but they're all pretty similar. I was able to take Nutrition and Sociology as co-requisites. <br>  <br>  An Associate's program takes about 2 years. A diploma program takes about 3. And, as stated above, the bachelor's program takes 4.<br>  <br>  A bachelor's program delves more deeply into theory and research, as well as some administrative aspects of nursing. <br>  <br>  Anyway, once you graduate from nursing school and pass your state boards, you can begin entry-level work as a Registered Nurse. Some places like you to have a year or two of med/surg nursing before you go into a specialty area like psychiatric nursing. It depends on the facility and their staffing needs at the time! <br>  <br>  Once you're a psychiatric nurse, you have all kinds of options to further develop your career. You can get a post-graduate degree and become a Nurse Practitioner or a Psychiatric Clinical Nurse Specialist... <br>  <br>  There's so much you can do, and it really is an exciting field. Keep your options open, and do a lot of reading and research to make sure it's really where your heart is! <br>  <br>  Talking about it makes me really miss the field, but I also enjoy where I work now. :)

For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having.

ZFo3XOURaa	Ok, Ce is a good oxidizing agent because its core element is large leaving its outer electrons far from the center of the atom where the protons reside. This makes it easy for electrons to be removed from the atom there by oxidizing it. Se is a much smaller atom, although larger it is in the same column as O, giving it similar properties to that of Oxygen which is one of the very best reducing agents available in the natural world. Its high electronegativitiy allows it to take electrons away from other atoms with lower electronegativity. Se has these same characteristics small in size only needing a few electrons to complete its outer most shell so it pulls on electrons just as Oxygen.

0wTOMifKaa	PayPal Policy for payment holds for eBay items <br>   <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  eBay and PayPal are working together to make it safer than ever to buy on eBay. One of the boldest steps we're taking is to identify transactions that pose the greatest risk of fraud and holding the payments from sellers for a period of time to help ensure that the transactions go smoothly.<br>  <br>  If you have received more than 20 Detailed Seller Ratings (DSRs) in the past 12 months and your DSR average is 4.5 or higher, your payments will not be held.<br>  <br>  What is a payment hold for an eBay item?<br>  It is a hold that PayPal places on a payment you receive for an item you sold on eBay. The amounts held will be shown as "Pending" in your PayPal account. You still have access to all other funds in your PayPal account.<br>  <br>  Why might my payments be held?<br>  PayPal will hold payments in transactions where the vast majority of seller fraud occurs. Here are the most common instances in which a payment may be held:<br>  <br>  You are new to eBay and sell an item above ￡50 <br>  You have a low feedback score and sell an item above ￡50 <br>  More than 5% of your transactions result in dissatisfied buyers* <br>  You have a low Detailed Seller Rating (DSR) <br>  You have not received a significant amount of Detailed Seller Ratings <br>  You are listing your item in a higher-risk category <br>  PayPal will not hold payments for eBay items if you meet the following criteria: <br>  You have been an eBay member for more than 6 months, and <br>  Your total Feedback score is greater than 100, and <br>  Fewer than 5% of your transactions result in dissatisfied buyers*<br>  <br>  OR <br>  Your average DSR is greater than 4.5, and <br>  Your have received more than 20 DSRs in the last 12 months <br>   <br>  <br>  What will happen if my payment is held?<br>  If you receive a payment that is held by PayPal, the amounts held will show as "Pending" in a separate PayPal balance on your account page. You will still have access to all other funds in your PayPal account.<br>  <br>  Your funds will immediately be released when one of the following occurs:<br>  <br>  The buyer leaves you positive feedback <br>  21 days pass without a dispute, claim, chargeback, or reversal filed on the transaction|`|7vK3pXu9aa	You can accept payment immediately after sign up.

XxUsLqXRaa	No....if you're robbing Peter to pay Paul, and juggling debts back and forth like that, all it's going to do is look confusing.  The credit bureaus want CONSISTENT payment histories on each individual debt.  They don't want to see your debts bouncing from card to card, nor do they really want to see you pay off the total debt each month.  For some inexplicable reason, they want you to carry a small balance and prove to them that you are able to manage it properly.  Transferring balances between cards just looks flighty.  Use both cards sparingly, and carry a small balance on them for a few months before paying them off.  Yes, it will cost you in interest rates, but that's the price of good credit.  Believe it or not, charging things on a credit card and paying them off right away has no real positive impact on your credit because you aren't showing a HISTORY of responsible money management.  With the credit bureau, you can never win.  All you can do is just do the best you can.|`|LQuCb310aa	no. but ifyou do transfer the amount make sure it is to a lower interest rate card. also check on the charges that the cc company charges to transfer the amount.

If you don't pay both of the credit cards off, all you do is increase the total balance and the interest that you pay over the long term.|`|5cvPPWjEaa	no its not necessary. if you want some guidance then visit<br>  <a href="http://www.payfromcards.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.payfromcards.blogspot.com</a>|`|N7G26k4Iaa	This is an expensive way to do it.  Unless you are transferring a balance, for which there is normally a 3% charge, you cannot use a credit card to pay off another credit card.  You can get a cash advance, which, again, is expensive, but I would not recommend that you do that either.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	Transferring debt from one card to another doesn't trick the bureaus into increasing your score. <br>  <br>  It's an old trick and if anything, it makes you look risky for the mere fact that you are constantly signing up for new credit so you can take advantage of the "introductory" rates.
Ch9TedMcaa	Banks will collect interest and principal payments when they issue loans. They loan out deposits to borrowers. When you buy a CD, the bank lends that money to someone at a higher rate of interest that you will make on it. Payment services is another form of revenue for the bank.<br>  <br>  One is not more important than the other.|`|ymUiY6E0aa	The most important for a bank is the deposits.<br>  <br>  From the deposits they can loan and create profit. Without substantial deposits the bank cannot sustain it's required "asset or cash on hand model", which could create a huge cash or shortage windfall.<br>  <br>  Any bank is able to use roughly about 40% or so (I'm not quite sure on the actual percentage) to loan out to it's existing or prospecting clientele. So in essence it works like this:<br>  <br>  1. Tom deposits $100 dollars into his savings account with ABC bank.<br>  <br>  2. ABC bank through the use of it's actuaries and statisticians understand that Tom usually keeps $80.00 of each $100 of a deposit for 45 days in the account.<br>  <br>  3. ABC then would lend $32.00 of the $100.00 to a current customer for a credit card collecting 20% annual interest.<br>  <br>  4. ABC bank then pays Tom a hefty 2.00% interest earned on the $100.00. So if the bank is paying TOM 2.00% but collecting 20% what is the difference????<br>  <br>  If you answered 18% your wrong. It's actually 1000%, that they are making on your money.<br>  <br>  Now here is where it gets somewhat tricky. Once the money is lent from ABC (essentially using TOM's monies), to Linda for the credit card. When Linda makes the monthly payment. The bank would then in turn lend a % of Linda's monthly payment to Barb for an auto loan. <br>  <br>  And with each monthly deposit from Tom plus Linda, Barb's and the other's monthly payments. They in turn are lent to someone else.<br>  <br>  However, if Barb or Linda would fail to make payment. Then the bank runs into an issue of not being able to turn that money over.<br>  <br>  Any semi-efficient bank can have one person's dollar in the hands of several people per month. It's called "money in motion". However, everyone is taught to keep your money in one spot for a very long time. Which in theory makes sense. But the reality is that Tom will never make money using an inefficient model.<br>  <br>  All it takes for a bank to collapse is the following:<br>  <br>  1. Tom goes against what the statistics show, and withdraws all his monies. But not just TOM, Barb and Linda do the same.<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  2. The media, from all the stories about a failing bank. Shows the report waaaaay too many times. So 20% of the customers withdraw monies from the financial institution. Well, once you demand a withdrawal banks need to give you the money. (Or SIPC depending on the situation).<br>  <br>  So those two factors could easily break any successful banking institution in the United States within months. And again....<br>  <br>  The Loan is where the bank makes it's money. If this too is not handled properly (i.e, high risk loans or subprime loans or credit cards or 0% non profitable auto loans + high rate of default = total destruction.)<br>  <br>  Why would a financial institution provide anyone with 0% interest for an extended period??? Because the monies isn't necessarily there, or exchanging hands. It only exchanges hands when there is action which calls for the bank to do so.<br>  <br>  Bank's offer the 0% because they are hoping your checking account, savings account, auto loan, home loan and the others will follow as well. Therefore they can use those monthly deposits or payments to loan out to others.<br>  <br>  So it is FEAR, GREED, LACK OF TRAINING, LACK OF EDUCATION that caused this huge financial downfall. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, CEO's have been getting paid huge dollars for years. So why is it such a concern now? I'll tell you why.<br>  <br>  It's the American why to blame other people for mistakes or issues that arise. It's not the American way to figure out what got us in this mess, and do correct any mistakes that have happened. Just look at the stimulus bill. Nothing in it states on reviewing policies, procedures on how things operate. It's only about injecting more money into a failed system.<br>  <br>  If you throw enough money at anything, you can make it work in time. But what happens if you don't have the money to throw at it??????? Which is where we are today.<br>  <br>  Just my two cents.
7yvLNerWaa	1 Identify your goals. (ie short term mid or long term)<br>  #2 Then your desired outcome. (ie protect assets, aggressively grow assets, moderately grow assets)<br>  #3 depending on #1 you then pick an investment vehicle. A quick example; A young person who is investing for retirement would probably be very aggressive since they can weather the market so they might go into individual stocks. A midlifer might not want to risk so much so they might go into governement bond funds where investments are guaranteed but the yields are lower..  A retired person might want to purchase an annuity or something which provides guaranteed income but will probably not grow.

If you have paid off all your debts and none of the payments were ever late, you should start seeing your scores go up in about 2 months.  IF, however, the credit cards that you paid off were all less than 2 years old, the scores wont go up by very much.  The credit bureau wants to see at least 2 years worth of on-time payments in order to establish an accurate credit rating on you.  Nonetheless, paying off your debts will help in more ways other than just your credit score, so I highly recommend it, if any way possible.|`|Ba4dBwWnaa	1 yr|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	It starts improving as you are paying off your debts.

xhe3ZAl8aa	In short: people unable to keep up with their loans because they didn't have a fixed rate, and could no longer afford the monthly payments.<br>  <br>  Well, there seems to be a series of events or the domino effect that caused this debacle... the government was lowering the interest rate, so more people could "qualify". Then, the government had an agreement with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in which they would buy the loans from other banks and the government would guarantee that these two giants had not losses. In other words, if Freddie or Fannie purchased a bad loan, then the government would pay it. Because the banks knew that they could always sell their loans to Freddie and Fannie, then they were not as careful as to whom to "qualify". <br>  <br>  The banks would heavily advertise properties and would offer loans to people who would not even put any money down. There were also loans given to people without checking their income. <br>  <br>  Before the government allowed a free for all or no control to lending, banks would not sell their loans but rather would keep them until maturity. Meaning that if they gave a loan to someone and this person defaulted, then the bank would lose the money.<br>  <br>  Right now because there was no control, and the government wanted more people to be qualified, the banks overtly extended loans to people who they would not dare to loan their own money. <br>  <br>  Because banks wanted to sell their loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they would a lot of loans like: no income verification loan (just like the name suggests)- meaning that if you said you made $90k the bank would not question you and would offer you a bigger loan; <br>  <br>  Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) the person would be paying an affordable interest rate for a short period of time and later the rate would increase considerably; banks were doing so well advertising their loans that many people bought into believing that buying a property even if you don't have the downpayment was okay because you could sell it in a couple of years and have no losses.<br>  <br>  It's been already been predicted that house-bubble was going to be burst sooner or later. A lot of people have lost their jobs, but more importantly their confidence. Remember that price is based on confidence. When people feel they can make the monthly payments, then they will pay any price. <br>  <br>  In the past if you wanted to buy a home, the bank would check how much percent of your income your monthly mortgage would represent. If it was 30% or less then you would "qualify", however today banks were giving loans to people who were speding 40%-50% of their income. When more than 30% of your monthly income goes to mortgage alone, then it means that you'll have less money to spend and become more likely to borrow- in other words, you'd be digging a deeper hole.<br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful.|`|AA11637393	People with bad credit credit ratings couldn't get fixed rate loans.

jZzYi3MLaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Legitimate or not, making money online is not so easy, but doable if one becomes a student of Internet marketing; studies and clearly understands the programs they are leaning toward before they make a commitment. But a 100% commitment is nonetheless the key to success in this industry. Without it you can forget it.<br>  <br>  The one thing to look out for is not so much of what they are telling you which is usually no more than an effluence of hype, but what they don't tell you and that's for you to find out. Sometimes it comes the hard way after you've spent some money in a program you've decided on only to find out that a crucial aspect of the program critical to your momentum was inadvertently overlooked.<br>  <br>  Take for instance Billionaire Warren Buffet. The guy reads 18-hours a day. That's because he knows the importance of understanding things before plunking down money, in his case, billions of dollars for the companies he buys.<br>  <br>  I watched a video today on Youtube of a guy who made 3+ million dollars with Google Adsence. Interesting.<br>  <br>  But make no mistake about it, Internet marketing is here to stay and is the wave of the present and certainly the future. China alone has 100 million Internet users. Many of these people are buying on the Net; books, music, food, pharmaceuticals, etc. If you had a 0.001 % of that market with a product your were promoting you'd be set for life.<br>  <br>  What I'm doing is promoting other people's products on the Internet for which I make a commission. Here's one program you might take a look at. The people are sincere and their support desk is very responsive. www.live-atm.com<br>  <br>  But whatever you do, study and learn the program first, Talk to an Internet marketing expert if possible about the program you think you might go with. Of course, there's the hours you can spend on the Net researching this subject.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be so long-winded here but, I'm in it for the long-haul because working for someone else is not an option and certainly not the way to financial independence and freedom.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|ZVUjhcM2aa	To start off I want to tell you that making money online legit and possible. <br>  <br>  What I reccomend is not to pay upfront, never! <br>  <br>  To start off you need something simple, later on it will get more complicated and you'd start earning more and more money.<br>  <br>  I do reccomend to read the make money online blog called IncomeBooster.org. It's the resource I used to start making good money on the internet. Here you can find latest news about making money online, as well as helpful news and updates. <br>  <br>  Making money online is not hard, just requires some knowledge.|`|mDnKPmibaa	<a href="http://cashcratereview.com" rel="nofollow">http://cashcratereview.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having.

3ed5a0850a3ad3e8ff1beaeea841b592aa	I am a Realtor in the north Texas area.  things you want to consider are:  medium size in comparison to the rest of the neighborhood(not the biggest or smallest), near good schools is a must, medium to large yard. large would be big enough for a pool and a play area for kids. keep the decor neutral. wild colors or specific decorating schemes are hard to resell.  3 car garage is recommended so there is room for 2 cars and storage for boat or motorcycle. large master bed with separate tub and shower is a good draw.  kitchen is a prime point for resale, don't go cheap here. solid surface counter tops(granite) with top of the line stainless steel appliances are the big draw right now.  game rooms and media rooms are popular as well.  my office has an office in colleyville as well. i would be happy to refer you to a Realtor that knows the area well to help you out. email me droemer05@yahoo.com|`|bc7035247d213e35a4aadc035dcf625caa	First of all... good luck! We are looking at buying a home around there and having it built custom, but only because we plan on staying in it forever! <br>  <br>  The housing in Texas in so abundant that homes will not peak in cost for YEARS to come. For instance, you can buy a brand new home for what one costs built in 1960. The market is definitely not like California because in California there is not enough room and the demand is high. <br>  <br>  I would keep doing research in regards to making a profit on a home out there. Should you buy a home and utilize it for rental property, you might be able to at least make a profit on that.

98147410401f37b0dfeb9d06b2de548faa	when you first begin your nursing career . . . as in being a student nurse, you are trained to pass the biggest test you will take in your life, called the NCLEX. The idea of nursing school is to create a "nurse" who is safe, not a nurse who is a specialist. The majority of the time you will spend wiping butts, cleaning dentures, learning skills, such as how to put in IV's, medications, piggybacking, NG tubes etc. As an RN you will learn a critical care component. <br>  When you graduate you are still a "baby" nurse, and it takes years of experience in the nursing profession to become proficient in your skills. <br>  After you have your RN license you can then specialize, such as becoming a critical care nurse, or obtaining your masters in clinical nurse specialist etc. <br>  A nurse, is not simply a "nurse" however when you get out of nursing school you should have the same knowledge that all beginning nurses have, that is to be safe.|`|6e2d56678755dcb1eb6fe6f8cffd2ceaaa	In nursing school you spend time in different departments, doing general duties.

Remember to get something in writing. After you pay if off, request the letter, and file a dispute with all three credit bureaus.

AA11365325	You need to have experience with a particular type of software called SAP.  It usually drives back office operations for large businesses.  SAP does everything and companies may have several or all the modules.  It can do procurement process, payables, payroll, personnel, inventory, customer relationship management, etc.<br>  <br>  They saythey are a "Provider of business software that helps improve relationships with customers and partners, streamline operations, and achieve efficiencies throughout the supply chain."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sap.com/index.epx" rel="nofollow">http://www.sap.com/index.epx</a><br>  <br>  Just an aside, to me the complexity in SAP is behind the scenes.  Unless you are trying to be an administrator or something.  For regular users on the job training is sufficient.  But it sounds like the company wants previous experience either to skimp on training costs or just to know that you have computer literacy skills and understand in that particular area (accounting, payroll, inventory, etc) the way that these business functions typically work and the common language that everybody else will understand.|`|AA10368850	SAP is a very complex business software application.  You must be highly qualified with several years of experience (preferably more than 3), in order to truly understand how to utilze the program properly.  Most people who have experience with SAP are usually certified or degreed employees in their line of work.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
AA10368850	Yes, with a college degree you are certainly headed on the right tract.  It is a given fact that most company employers are seeking not only the length of experience but are also in hot pursuit of exclusive background credentials that only a college degree would entail. <br>  <br>  Just take a look at some of the much higher compensated telecommuting opportunities online.  You won't be surprised at all to see exacty how many employers are actually looking for candidates with at least a bachelors degree or more than 5 years of experience in the field of choice.  <br>  <br>  So if you have a bachelors degree your chances of landing a great paying career are greatly enhanced and if you have a masters degree, your opportunity of being hired by some of  the nation's major employers will go thru the roof!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IVosuMWmaa	Hi if you are looking for information on work at home jobs then go to <a href="http://www.workathomeblog.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.workathomeblog.org</a> its a great resourse to get information on work at home oppertunities such as data entry, cash surveys, online surveys, mystery shoppers, ideas for ebay, starting a bussiness, how to pay taxes, and all other types of money making tips and advise.

Overall this would have a better impact on your credit score than paying cards off randomly.<br>  <br>  If you can't pay off all of your debt at once, I would recommend setting a goal of getting your balances to 50% across the board.

b9e2bb5a25c57cc333a03588822952e8aa	Haha, I used to live in Maine and I know what you mean!  I have sinced moved to New York City, for that reason... but anyway, to solve your problem... :)<br>  <br>  For some reason, people in Maine GENERALLY don't post ads online on Careerbuilder, Monster, HotJobs, etc.  It's just a regional thing I guess, Mainers just don't do it.  Instead of online job searches, try looking in your local paper for jobs.  If you don't have a degree, look for Administrative or Executive Assistant jobs, which tend to pay the highest, considering.  If you still don't find jobs listed, hit the pavement and drop off your resume in person at all the office buildings in your town.  If you live in a city, that's obviously ideal, but even if you live in the smallest town imaginable, you'd be surprised at how many doctors, accountants, chamber of commerce and school district offices are looking for help.  To be honest, Maine is a poor job state.  There's no denying it.  I went through the same thing.  Just work with what you have, try to apply to jobs in the biggest town near you (salaries tend to be higher in cities or large towns), be willing to make the commute, and SELL yourself.  (And no, I don't mean on the streets...!)  Be firm about your earnings, and state how much you think you're worth.  Retail jobs are hard to negotiate, but any secretary's salary is negotiable, so negotiate that extra dollar or two out of them.  Good luck!|`|d3271032803d151a93181b0cb2e69861aa	Well, those are jobs maybe you should take a lower paying job until you can find a good one.

The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.<br>  <br>  A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!<br>  <br>  Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two.

I left a reputable real estate firm to pursue the same position.  They are great at "show".  Wow 1.5%  to list your house.  After the second week of training I realized I was to be trained to not show the fees. Get the listing.  You get $200 when it is sold.  You never show the fine print to the customer.  First 90 days of listing they get a sign out front and a picture of their house on their website.  The homeowner will be contacted if they get a hit.  They are responsible for all appointments.  After 90 days their listing will be placed on a multiple listing service at 4%.  No further service.  <br>  You are on your own as you were from the beginning.  Most major Real Estate companies will not show your home.  Why? To split 2% commission for no help from the listing company.  The sale of real estate can be handled by those that are savvy and have experience and good legal represention.  The concept of a "Foxton" was thought as way to make money but the founders were looking at the money and not the service.

Por otro lado no cabe duda que son muy necesarias para hacer un historial crediticio para cuando quieres hacerte de algo mas caro que, sino es a crédito seria muy difícil de tener como un carro nuevo o una casa por ejemplo hoy la mayoría de bancos dan muchas facilidades para sacar una cuenta de crédito y como ya hay mas competencia las tasas de interés ya no son tan altas, pero también es importante que la tarjeta por la que te decidas sea aceptada en todos lados que puedas pagar con tarjeta, solo recuerda que uno  de las principales objetivos de las tarjetas es hacerte sentir que con el poder de un plástico puedes pagar y pagar sin limites pero después que te llegan los cobros es cuando bien el arrepentimiento.

77cdf09dcf79edd6fc4d43e1c87004edaa	First, do you like this job (aside from the evil boss thing)?   Your fellow employees are in the same situation that you are, but you don't need to make a martyr of yourself if you need the job.  <br>  <br>  If your H/R depart refuses to get involved, there isn't a whole lot that you can do either sit there and take it, or find something new...<br>  <br>  If this is a company-wide problem, you could check into a labor board inquiry if it is done anonymously.    If you by chance are a union affiliated shop, then you might be able to get something looked at from that side.  Remember don't raise red flags......<br>  <br>  Good Luck and hope this or something else will help.|`|WjYYeYRYaa	The best "supervisor" is actually someone who is a mentor or a guide. The worst ones "supervise" -- they know very little about how to motivate people and are almost always hyperactive "A" types. They can be physically dangerous as well as being dangerous to company morale. A well adjusted supervisor knows how to control his temper and TALK to human beings...<br>  <br>  The @sshole that you're dealing with knows little about supervision and even less about managing problems. He shows his emotions negatively to hide the fact he doesn't know how to FIX the problem. He's more interested in himself than others. In reality, the underlying fact is that he's afraid and scared of what could happen. He's immature. <br>  <br>  Go talk to management privately about this problem child and do some documenting. If it continues, keep documenting and eventually go present the mountain of proof to your manager. A smart manager will cover his rear end by getting rid of this nut case. If he gets rid of you, make sure you have copies and -- get a lawyer. <br>  <br>  To be honest, I have found Rule #1 to always be true -- The guys with the best attitudes are always the best workers. Find them, keep them, and stay with them. <br>  <br>  Ever had a problem up at DMV -- I bet it was with a problem child and I bet it came with an attitude. Poor performance usually comes with a bad attitude...GRRRRR...<br>  <br>  Ever had good service somewhere -- I bet it was with someone who was cheerful ! People with good attitudes usually do the best work ;-) wink wink <br>  <br>  Best of luck, cheers !|`|AA11702127	Don't interfere, unless you want to find new employment. If your co-workers are smart, they will document the boss' behavior and take steps to get it corrected themselves, or they can look for new employment also.<br>  <br>  Raising your head above the crowd is a good way to get it sliced off, so don't draw attention to yourself unnecessarily. At least, that's my advice to you if you don't want to get fired or quit. If you don't care about staying employed at that particular company, then by all means, get involved. Otherwise, keep your head down, do your work and keep out of the politics as much as possible.|`|uZUQ7IK6aa	wow, that's a tough one, I assume you are union, is there any way to talk to your union rep about it, maybe he can have more success with the company, or document the abuse and file a joint lawsuit, if that doesn't constitute an uncomfortable work environment I don't know what does!

I would go to the welfare department in your area, and speak with someone about your situation<br>  <br>  You can get off of it whenever you want.  Usually, what happens is you make more money, or start work, and you simply become ineligible for benefits anyway.

As a business student it depends on the person hey gordon is worth over a million so his tactics may work. He is a very agitated person but a business should have a balance of both authority and a bit of freedom you dont want to overwork staff etc. However mutual agreement and a good understanding is key. Other factors like money, organisation type of business can play a part. Most importantly the purpose matters is this a formal or informal business and what are its objectives. When looking at good old Gordon his criteria is go on the rampage sometimes this work shove the staff and make all the key decisons. However being a teamplayer, being coperatve and always trying new ideas and initiatives are the most important thing. At the end of the day all workers have to be accountable to the shareholders and if the business makes a good gross profit through a certain management technique we need to consider is it a finnacial or a moral motive. Such as a charity they are able to fund for the needy there motive will be different to a bank. Thus the whole procedure has to be looked in as a overall context Gordon businbess strategy works. But if you a a mixture of authority and some ability to give employees empowerment this may be helpfull. Also as the theory of production goes its sensible to give workers a break so that they do not do the same thing this is true with factory production. However adam smith a key theory in economics talked about specialisation and this does help. Inconclusion managing a business depends on the person and his motive, financial position and past sucess also his personality like Gordon ramsay makes up some of his decision making process.

5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	According to the American Academy of Forensic Scientists:<br>  <br>  What Do Forensic Scientists Do?<br>  The forensic sciences form a vital part of the entire justice and regulatory system. Some of the different divisions, or disciplines, of forensic science have become identified primarily with law enforcement — an image enhanced by television and movies. This is misleading because forensic scientists are involved in all aspects of criminal cases, and the results of their work may serve either the defense or the prosecution. The forensic scientist's goal is the evenhanded use of all available information to determine the facts and, subsequently, the truth.<br>  <br>  The forensic scientist's role in the civil justice arena is expanding. Issues range from questions of the validity of a signature on a will, to a claim of product liability, to questions of whether a corporation is complying with environmental laws, and the protection of constitutionally guaranteed individual rights.<br>  <br>  Forensic science is a rewarding career where the love of science can be applied to the good of society, public health, and public safety.<br>  <br>  Work:<br>  The work of the forensic scientist may reduce the number of cases entering our overloaded court system by assisting the decision-makers before a case reaches the court. The facts developed by forensic scientists, based on scientific investigation, not circumstantial evidence or the sometimes unreliable testimony of witnesses, may convince prosecuting or defense attorneys, a grand jury, or a judge that an issue does not merit a court hearing.<br>  <br>  The work of the forensic scientist at times proves the existence of a crime or makes connections to a crime. The forensic scientist provides information and expert opinion to investigators, attorneys, judges, and juries which is helpful in determining the innocence or guilt of the accused.<br>  <br>  The rule of law is based on the belief that the legal process results in justice. This has come under some question in recent years. Of course, the forensic scientist cannot change skepticism and mistrust single-handedly. He can, however, contribute to restoring faith in judicial processes by using science and technology in the search for truth in civil, criminal, and regulatory matters.<br>  <br>  The forensic scientist is entirely responsible for the work he performs; no one else can write his report nor testify to his opinion. However, it takes teamwork to solve a crime. Scientists work closely with police officers, sheriff's deputies, prosecuting and defense attorneys, DEA, CIA, and FBI agents, immigration workers, and crime scene investigators, to name a few.<br>  <br>  There is a strong requirement for accurate record keeping, chain-of-custody documentation, stringent quality control, and data management. Chain-of-custody guarantees that the integrity of evidence is maintained at all times. The time, date, location, and signature are required when transporting a piece of evidence within the laboratory or to an outside facility.<br>  <br>  How Do I Become a Forensic Scientist?<br>  You will need:<br>  <br>  - a bachelor's degree — get one in science; some forensic sciences require advanced degrees; take chemistry, biology, math, English composition<br>  - good speaking skills — take public speaking, join the drama club, toastmasters, the debate team<br>  - good note-taking skills — you can't subscribe to a service or depend on Cliffs Notes in real life!<br>  - the ability to write an understandable scientific report<br>  - intellectual curiosity<br>  - personal integrity<br>  <br>  How Much Money Will I Make? What will my hours be?<br>  <br>  Income in the forensic sciences varies greatly depending upon your degree, your actual job, where you work, and how many hours you work. You may never "get rich" but you will have a good income. You will be satisfied with your job, knowing you are contributing to justice — keeping the good guys on the street and helping put the bad guys in jail. Forensic scientists work different hours, depending upon what they do. Some work in forensic laboratories and work 40 hours a week, Monday through Friday. Others work out in the field on digs and may work different hours. Still others are "on call" and work after their regular shift and receive overtime or compensatory (comp) time. Essentially every branch of forensic science offers opportunities for personal growth, career advancement, and increasing financial compensation. <br>  <br>  Where Will I Work?<br>  Forensic scientists work in laboratories, at crime scenes, in offices, and in morgues. They may work for federal, state and local government, forensic laboratories, medical examiners offices, hospitals, universities, toxicology laboratories, police departments, medical examiner/coroner offices, or as independent forensic science consultants.<br>  <br>  Education and Training:<br>  The minimum requirement is a bachelor's degree in chemistry, biology, physics, molecular biology, or a related science. In the future, a master’s degree may be required. Many colleges and universities offer degrees and courses in forensic science. In deciding whether to get a degree in chemistry or biology, or one in forensic science, study the courses offered. At least 24 semester hours of either chemistry or biology is required and math is a must. The title of the degree is not as important as the courses taken.<br>  <br>  To keep up with the many advances in science, the criminalist must take continuing education courses all during his career. By passing a very tough examination, the criminalist may become certified by the American Board of Criminalistics (<a href="http://www.criminalistics.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.criminalistics.com/).</a> Entire forensic laboratories may prove their competence by becoming accredited by organizations such as the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors/Laboratory Accreditation Board (www.ascld.org/lab). <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11086883	crime scene investigation|`|hBJqTkxBaa	You can work in the criminal aspect of it, pay is good,. hrs vary lots and you have to have a stomach for it<br>  You can go into anthro field and travel all over the world<br>  Or work simple for a lab...<br>  If you have an interest in it it will be a good job:)

For short term profits, I'd buy GIGM when it hit $11 or so and then sell when it gets back to $15.<br>  <br>  Nike I wouldn't buy, but if I held the stock I wouldn't sell it either (i.e. I recommend that one as a hold).|`|777abd0a88c542a029db43895ca6ebf3aa	Hi,<br>  <br>     If I were young, I would be investing in small cap growth mutual funds or stocks.  Go here for excellent low cost advice (<a href="http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/commentaries/stockportfolio/200701comment.cfm)." rel="nofollow">http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/comme...</a><br>  <br>     Don't be alarmed at the low cost - it has some of the best financial advice on the Web.<br>  <br>       You have lots of time before retirement which means the magic of compound interest will just keep building and building.  It really works and if you keep investing every year, in 10 or 15 years you will be surprised at how it mounts up.  In 30 years you could be a millionaire which probably won't amount to much in 30 year owing the the ravages of inflation.<br>  <br>    By that time you will need a money manager like Fisher Investments to manage your money - probably before when you reach the $500,000 mark.<br>  <br>    And that's the primary reason to keep investing in small cap growth stocks - they will flog inflation to death.<br>  <br>     When investing in mutual funds, select the no-load funds only.  Do not invest in mutual funds with a "load", an up front commission that you have to pay before when they sell you the mutual fund.  Some charge as much as 10% which is a rrip-off.  Many studies have shown that the no-load funds do as well as the load funds and sometimes a lot better.<br>  <br>     Look at the AAI Shadow Stock Portfolio.  I would try and emulate that portfolio if you want to invest in stocks.  It was up 25% as of November 2006.  The Vanguard Index fund is only up 14%.<br>  <br>     AAII has some of the best financial advisers and the cost is very low.   They have excellent guides and advice.<br>  <br>    You may need a broker so go to e-Trade or Scottsdale who have low commission rates.<br>  <br>     Do your own due diligence.  Your own ideas are the best.  Do not depend on someone else to select investments for you.  Learn about investing so you don't have to ask what stocks to invest in.  <br>  <br>     Be self reliant.  <br>  <br>     Remember what Emerson said:  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines.

AA11760500	I feel for you, having had a similar situation.  All I can say is document EVERYTHING and look for another job.

Talk to the one you like and explain the situation.  Also, if you're not happy with your job, get busy looking for another position else where.  There's more fish in the ocean after all.  <br>  <br>  Your work environment shouldn't be negative or so stressful that you end up hating going to work.  That leads to lots of trouble for you and the employer.  Stress is a poison that you control, remember that.

If your having a party; or hell, have a party and invite her to bring along some of her friends too. Maybe there will be even more than one connection between acquaintances. I say go for it. The best part is that you know where/who each other comes from without having to learn as you go. Good luck!|`|gz6iUqbDaa	If you're family and she wants to stay in touch, all of those ideas are fine.

A few weeks later they called me!! said they had let her go, and would I come back? with a raise? of course I would....but you may not be so lucky...get out but DO let the powers that be know the reason you are leaving....you may be just one of many who complain about her..you are too young and life is too short to put up with that type of nonsense. we all have stuff we don't like about our work/jobs, & most can be put up with, but not that..Good Luck!!|`|AA11350882	Move on.

No point wasting your time and effort in a job that makes you miserable and end up being termed under-performer.

Google Checkout currently serves as a means of transferring money between a user and online stores, whereas PayPal can be used between any two parties.  So Google Checkout is much more limited, but it does have some nice features like storing money online for ease of buying things and fraud protection.

Yes, the commission checks on multi-million dollar homes are nice however, real estate agents live on commission alone.  If it takes you 6 months to sell your first house, you have no paycheck for 6 months (unless you are working somewhere else too).<br>  <br>  Have you applied to schools in California?  Have you looked at different areas that you would be interested in selling real estate in?  Do you know how to get your real estate license in California?  Real estate agents that people like to say, "oooh. i could do that... they make SO much money..." have been in real estate for a while-- they didnt just decide to sell real estate and make a ton of money.  <br>  <br>  Being a real estate agent is opening a small business.  You provide a service for people buying or selling real estate but you have to run your life much like a business.  Most people shop for homes on weekends.  If you dont work a weekend, you can miss out on sales.  <br>  My point is that the really successful real estate agents work when everybody else has gone home for the evening.<br>  <br>  I think that yes, real estate is a good field of work and offers people great futures... however, I think your plan seems more like a pipe dream and pretty naiive to think its that easy to just up and move to California and start selling multi-million dollar homes.<br>  <br>  I say this because I sell real estate and its much harder and more time consuming than I ever would have guessed prior to getting into the field.|`|fe1a69ec9fc7fb7631a59c2ecba7dccdaa	Becoming a real estate agent is not as easy as it sounds.  This is especially true if you are moving to a new area.  Do you know people in California?  How will you market yourself as an agent?   There are thousands and thousands of agents competing for the same listings in CA as in other states.  If you do not have a solid marketing plan, it would be very difficult and expensive to break into the market.|`|g9F8NFmIaa	That sounds all good and great, but making money at real estate for a new unestablished inexperienced agent is HARD. Trust me. Especially in a state where many people can't even afford it. <br>  Your first year in real estate will be your hardest and most frustrating one. Unless you hook up with a top producer and he gives you his leads on a split. Competing withthe thousands of agents (who have the same goals and idea you do) is difficult, getting people approved for a loan to even buy lately is difficult, and the agents that have been there and in it awhile and are established are the ones who do most business (unless you have friends and family, a ton of referrals, etc)<br>  If you are going to move there and get your license and go to school, that is great, but you have to have another job besides being a realtor, because it just isn't steady enough. It isn't how you think. <br>  People are so flaky and full of s**t, you have no idea. Not trying to discourage you, just being honest and preparing you.

It is good if you are willing to put in some time at the beginning.  Bascially all you are doing is growing a business.

I used to do headhunting part-time for an agency in NYC and just from my experience, the economy has forced agencies to join and take on all types of models.  For example, Ford now has a petite modeling division, which they never had before.  In shifting with the times, it forced the smaller, more niche-targeted agencies to close.  I suggest going to a larger, more traditional agency.  They're accepting all different types of models and have great access to JCPenney, Toys R Us, and other companies that love working with special needs models.  Good luck!

A good place to get Ur choice of resume templates is<br>   www.mirosoft.com/en-us/templates  <br>  Of course design Ur resume toward the field U want to have as Ur career.  I'm going to send U some sites 4 U to go to to get ideas. The 1st is a basic on for employment, by me not knowing where U R U can zero in once U have the sites.<br>  www.jobs.com/   is a golable search for employment.  Now I'm goin to grab 1 outta the blue.  Lets say U want to be in adminstration or manegement or an office manger. here  are some sites for that.

There R many , many more sites.  The best advice I can give anyone looking for an adminstrative job is (& if U know this I'm sorry i wasted Ur time) 1st impressions is a real thing.  When meeting an employer for an interview Firm hand shake & look them square in the eyes.  Speak clearly and always make eye contact.  I was in Industrial Construction Mangement as a Purchasing Manger for the last 15 years I worked.  Have a couple styles of resumes, of course only give each interviewer 1.  Hold your head high & proud.  That resume tells all they need 2 know (1st impression again)  Set Ur goals high.  If U come in at an entry level that's fine gives U a lot of room to grow.  I hope I have helped you.  You sound to me like a good person with goals in mind & a good future in front of you.  I know I did notsend U exactly what U needed.

First, they will say, "Tell me about yourself".  Make it sound like you are the best thing since sliced bread.  Next they will say, "Why do you want to work here".  Make something up.  Another question that always comes up is "Tell me one of your bad traits".  Your answer has to start out as a bad trait that you want to work on.

Even if he gave one MONTH notice, any flights he was already booked for were already paid for, so would those come out as well?  Flights have to be booked far in advance, and God forbid, if they booked him FIVE flights, they'd be taking his whole paycheck!  And how can your son be sure that they are taking out what they actually paid for the ticket?  Most corporations purchase airfare at wholesale prices (we're talking less than $100 roundtrip, in some cases) so if they're taking a lot out of his paycheck, ask to see proof that THEY paid that much for the ticket.  You don't want them charging him out of spite.  I don't think it's legal for them to charge your son for the flight.  Corporations pay for airfare insurance for that reason... in case they need to cancel!  I would talk to a lawyer if you can afford it, and the better business bureau if you can't.  People say the better business bureau doesn't do much, but that's simply not true... they got me out of a complicated gym membership contract in just two weeks, so they move pretty fast.

If she loses enough customers, she'll probably make you wear something else.  <br>  <br>  I think it's reverse discrimination.  By saying that you have to wear the uniform, she's trying to get you to turn down the job offer or not file a discrimination lawsuit against her.  <br>  <br>  If she doesn't hire any guys in any positions, then it's discrimination, but if she has male cooks, then I guess you'll just have to wear the uniform.<br>  <br>  What's the name of the restaurant?

Either you really need the job or you really want to dress-up as a girl or be forced to dress-up as a girl. Surely you can find another job and if you want to cross-dress go for it. But I think if you want the job & get the job, then you have to wear their uniform. I think you should give it a try, who knows, you might like working as a girl & the tips might be better if you look good. You can always look for another job, unless you really like wearing the girls uniform at work. Have fun & make the best of the situation.

VG4gKiggaa	(1) Identity Guard is ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS! It doesn't "guard" anything. They just gather (regularly) all your personal information. You can monitor your own credit decently enough FOR FREE just by using www.annualcreditreport.com. If you actually want an ID theft protection that will DO something if your ID gets stolen, get Zander Insurance's ID theft program (link below). Honestly, though, I do not even buy that. I pull 1 of my 3 bureaus every 4 months, I regularly renew the fraud flags on my bureaus, I opted out of "preapproved" offers, & if I ever move to a state that will allow me to FREEZE my credit w/o having to be a victim of theft FIRST, then I will FREEZE the whole d****ed file!<br>  <br>  (2) If you are serious about getting your financial act together, I recommend Dave Ramsey's "Total Money Makeover" book. Following it, we have paid off tons (I'm embarassed to say, but way more than $4k) of debt, paid cash for our cars, saved for emergencies, etc. You guys have relatively little debt & a decent income, you should be able to clean up what you have very easily & quickly following his plan. Once you are finished reading, you will also understand that you DO NOT NEED A CREDIT SCORE (not even to buy a house) & probably will decide (like me) that you don't even WANT one.<br>  <br>  (3) It is VERY important for you guys to read that book & get "on the same page" when it comes to money.

kCOCyKataa	Yeah, if your sure that you can continue making the payments.  Otherwise, you will lose your house.  If you quit paying on the student loans, your credit will be greatly affected, but you will still keep your house.<br>  <br>  If the payments are not anything to worry about, then I would refinance with a lower interest rate definitely.  Even a percentage or two lower is alot of money saved in the long run.|`|8ruwONI2aa	It doesn't matter if you're talking about student loans, mortgages, credit card debt, or car loans.  The "best" debt is debt with relatively low interest rates--you want the debt with the lowest interest rates you can get.  <br>  <br>  Say you're shopping for a car, for example.  If you have a credit card with a fixed 5% rate, and you qualify for an auto loan at 8%, you should put your car on your credit card as crazy as that sounds.  The goal is always to minimize your interest rate so you can pay the debt off faster.  <br>  <br>  If you are paying 9-11% on student loan debt and you can qualify for a 6-7% mortgage, then you should definitly re-fi your home and pay off the student debt.|`|RMG09hTLaa	i think that  the below website will help you to find the right solution|`|sE3H0gwjaa	House is better because you get a tax break with the mortgage.

There is a big difference between the northside of the city vs. the southside.  Price range is going to play a big part in what part of the city you are moving.  Most people that want to be closer to the lake end up in a condo because of the lower prices, better views, and other amenities.  <br>  I think the newest area to move in is the near southside.

Below is more information that will help...<br>  <br>  This firm offers medical transcription for hospitals and doctors as a work at home business opportunity. The BBB pulled their membership "due to a pattern of complaints regarding the company's selling practices, customer service, and product quality."   <br>  <br>  They charge applicants $397 for software and training.  Many candidates complain that they were never paid after being hired on.  Also job applicants must pass the company's testing procedures before they are paid.

Unfortunately, they do not update regularly and some of the information may not be up-to-date.  There are homes on the site that are not available any longer, or the prices are wrong...etc.  A Realtor has up-to-the-minute availability to all the local listings.  And your Realtor will also be able to refer you to a reputable property management company if renting is the best option for you.<br>  <br>  Happy Hunting!|`|a8c906f035c0cce8ff4eddf99b310e3daa	www.realtor.com|`|YDIWhciCaa	Go to sibcy cline, Remax and other known relaters.<br>  sibcycline.com, remax.com

Most women can tell if the product is the real thing and not a knock off so as long as it's the real stuff and it's not illegal then selling them in your salon should be fine.

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	It is the inspectors fault, but your problem.    They will most likely allow you to have an inspection and obtain your permits.   The other option is to require you to tear everything out.   The bathroom is their main concern.    But, you need to either pass inspection or remove it, there is no middle ground.
LYHJ8gqFaa	Find a SBA office near your home town.  If there isnt one close, call them and ask what kind of resources you have in your area.  Look up SCORE...I forget what the acronym means buts its a bunch of retired executives who help small businesses from the ground up.  Once youve completed your business plan have a business mentor look at it.  Again the SBA and if they are in your area SCORE will have mentors that will help.  A lot of this stuff is free of charge too so its a VERY good resource.

cs4n4Fgzaa	Depends on what kind of competition you mean. In the realm of cosmetics, their competitors are any major cosmetic brand - Cover Girl, Revlon, L'Oreal, etc.  In the realm of door-to-door sales programs or in-home party sales programs, they compete with different companies like Pampered Chef, Tastefully Simple, etc.
sI3krJULaa	All benefits like health insurance and retirement plans are completely optional for employers.  They have to provide workers comp and basic liability insurance for their business, but nothing for the employees themselves.  So your company is allowed to drop your health insurance.  Not even COBRA covers that event, so you're out of luck, unfortunately. :0(    As for the 401(k), your question is a little vague, but, again, there are no requirements for an employer with regards to such a benefit, other than what is covered under ERISA.  So, for instance, if you defer payments to a 401(k) out of your paycheck, they have to put it into the Plan within a certain time frame (it's complicated, but, essentially, they can't wait more than 30 days after they take it, at the very longest.  Most employers have a much shorter time frame- usually a few days.)  If you feel like your money isn't being handled responsibly, ask your HR person when the next audit is for your benefit plan.  If you have over 100 employees and a 401(k), they're required to have the plan audited by an independent firm.  Then express your concern over compliance with ERISA.  They have to pay fines and pay you back for lost interest if they're truly holding onto your withholding for too long.    Sorry for the rambling.  Hope that helps. :0)

AA11737531	The other answers are correct as far as they go,  roughly 30 to 40% after taxes and penalty, but actually much more than that.  If the stock market is more in line with past than it is today, you will double your money about every 7 to 8 years, this means that in the year 2016 you will have 42,000, in the year 2023 you will have 84,000, In the year 2030 you will have 168,000 and in the year 2039 (30 Years) you will have $336,000.00 so in overall terms you will get about $15,000 and you will lose $321,000.00 or in other words you will lose about 21.4 times the amout you will withdraw.  Borrow the money at 5% and leave you IRA alone.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	10% penalty and around 20% taxes depending on your tax bracket.

Wjy are you pulling it out?|`|OuQizrQ6aa	There is a 10% penalty plus any earnings you've had beyond your contributions will be taxed according to your tax bracket. You can take out a 60 day loan penalty free provided you pay it back within the 60 days. For a first time home purchase, you can pull out up to 10k penalty free. And you can also use it to pay for health insurance if you're unemployed. Other than that, you'd be pretty foolish to take any of that money out. The penalties are steep!|`|SN5dYkafaa	Clearly you're younger than age 59 1/2 so the IRS imposes a 10% early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies.

That is, if you take out the whole $21,000, expect only to actually be able to keep $10,500 or so.|`|tIfOxMuaaa	its taxable.. and yes leave it.... in our day and age.. any savings for retirement should be left because the Canadian pension plan wont last as long as they expected.|`|I8leFJPJaa	Check this out.
