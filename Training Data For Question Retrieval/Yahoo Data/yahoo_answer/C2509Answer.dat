0Vdq2hFeaa	so far there are four books. They are about a girl who thinks she is living a normal life when she finds out she is a vampire. She ends up having to go this school for vampires(if she doesn't she will die). While she is there she has to deal with friends, boys, and family. Not to mention there is evil going on. They are REALLY good books.|`|apxKzwyzaa	It should be all in my sources :]    The House of Night is a series of young adult Fantasy/Horror novels co-authored by P.C. Cast and her daughter Kristin Cast. The series revolves around the development and adventures of Zoey Redbird, a 16-year-old gifted fledgling vampyre who attends the House of Night school where she will eventually change into a Vampyre or die in the process.    Books are marked, betrayed, chose, untamed, and hunted|`|ue7sKvLOaa	So far there are four:  Marked  Betrayed  Chosen  Uninvited  and they are all by P.C. Cast and Kristen Cast.    They are about a girl, Zoey Redbird, and she is marked as a vampire and must join the House of Night which is a school in which she will learn to become an adult vampire.  The twist is that some do not make it through "the change" of becoming an adult vampire.      They are pretty good books, but honestly, they are written simply and it's almost like reading a Fan Fiction about vampires.|`|9EW08emXaa	The House of Night is a vampire series.  The main character, Zoey, finds out in the beginning that she is turning into a vampire.  The vampire image is a little different in this series. Some people are just born as vampires...like when they enter adolescence, the change starts to take place in their genes...there are lots of vampires in the world with normal jobs.   The House of Night is just one of the schools that teens go to throughout the world to learn skills that will help them in their new life.    Marked  Betrayed  Chosen  Untamed  the 5th book comes out in a couple months, but you can easily read the 4 previous ones before then.  They are easy to read, easy to get into...fun new take on the vampire thing.|`|sE1kg9qraa	Theres 4 books right now but there is a Fifth book coming out.The first book is called marked and its were a human gets marked with creasent moon on her forehead so she has to go to this school for vampire flegelings.

There they learn about vampire history and normal classes like english, drama, etc. But they all go to this school waiting for the "change" which means they turn from a fledgling into an adult vampire. Some survive the change, others don't. Zoey is from a family with a religious stepdad who turns the family against her and she is left with her grandma to care for her. The rest are about several experiences in the House of Night.

yQiC58bHaa	What I usually like to do is look up names with meanings; I find myself particularily drawn towards old Greek names, or names that you don't hear often. If I find a name I like, I'll add it to my ever-growing list along with it's meaning. Then I'll usually try and find a name meaning something that relates to my character in some way, be it personality or something else about them.     Here's the link to the website I usually use.     http://www.name-meanings.com/greek_name_...

Also on babynames.com are some other tips for writers so you can look there. :)|`|ve4K3rb1aa	several ways -    you could decide what they are like and then look up names that mean that,  for example,  caroline means radiatin beauty,  or claire means illuminating.    the name should fit the personality.    or you could get a baby name book and just flick thourhg and stop a arandom page/name and use it.    i sometimes name characters after my friends,  or after something importnat to me.  for instance,  i names one of my characters after the imaginary friend that my best friend had when she was a child.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	http://babynamesworld.parentsconnect.com...

You can also search by state, like I said, so you could find the most popular names for, say, Illinois for 1994 if you want to make it more specific.

One of my all-time favorite Holocaust books however, is The Book Thief by Markus Zusak. It's set during the Holocaust of course, but told from the point of view of a young female German citizen, who's foster family ends up hiding a Jew in their basement, and it's all about her growing up during the war.

After the ship was sunk, Wilson sent a stern letter to the German government, but nothing else. The Germans promised to stop directly attacking every ship that entered British waters, and did for a time. In the final years of the war, however, they began to attack any ship in sight again, and this aggravated Wilson. What I think finally did it was when the British handed over the Zimmermann note, which was an intercepted note from the German government to the Mexican government, asking them to attack the US if they entered the war, and in return for doing so the Mexicans would get back the land they had lost, including Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, California, etc. Immediately after this note was published in the media, Wilson asked Congress for war.

5llBXFF4aa	YES, YES - a thousand times yes.  There's absolutely no doubt that slavery was the cause of the Civil War.  I could write volumes (as others have done) proving it, but all you have to do is listen to the words of the Confederate leaders PRIOR to the War.  Jefferson Davis and the other southern leaders said very plainly that it was the protect6ion of slavery for which they fought - that they fought for the right not only to have slaves (which no one - not Lincoln or anyone else in the government, was trying to take from them), but to EXPAND slavery into more territories.  Davis and the other leaders wanted to annex Cuba and other Central American countries specifically in order to expand the power base of slavery.    The so-called "state's rights" argument is ridiculous.  The ONLY right that the south cared about was the right to have slaves.  The "economic oppression" argument is silly, because the factor that was keeping the southern economy lagging behind the north was the used of slave labor, which prevented high wages, prevented manufacturing from thriving, and prevented economic growth outside of planting.    Those who try to suggest that the Civil War was about anything but slavery haven't read much, or haven't read the right books.  It's revisionist history to suggest that it was about anything else.|`|1fHoS5vkaa	No, it was just a flash point. The real reason the states warred was the issue of states rights. The southern states wanted the right to make and keep their own laws without interferance from the federal government. The feds wanted to make federal laws that the states would have to follow and enforce, even if those laws were contrary to what the states themselves said was not against any state laws.|`|VQT4qjQjaa	No. Expansionism was, and manifest destiny.     Basically, there was exactly the same amount of slave states and free states represented in congress. Adding a slave or free state would tip the balance of power, so when the South tried to get more slave states into the union.    long story short, It tried to secede and someone decided that was unconstitutional.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	You could say that.  Although, some people will try to say it was to keep the union together, the fact is the two sides were arguing over slavery.  Slavery had to become and issue first before the south threatened to cecede from the union because of it.  And because of that, a war was fought to keep the union together.|`|TPVvddHWaa	Yes.    Abraham Lincoln wanted to abolish slavery but several states did not want this to happen and decided to declare themselves independent of the union.    That started the war.|`|kH0AsPfgaa	Absolutely not.  The South's desire to secede with the North was the main cause (effort led by Jefferson Davis).    Slavery was a secondary cause.    Look it up!|`|9qxQtLYTaa	you could say Slavery was definatley the main cause, but it was not the only cause: many other things contributed to the civil war, such as: the election of abraham lincoln, union rights vs. state rights, north vs. south "bleeding kansas"- the south also wanted to secede from the north  ?|`|5VyqaCbXaa	not a cause, the southern states didn't want to be persecuted by Lincoln who supported the North, so they left. Once the war started Lincoln abolished slavery in southern states so that European nations wouldn't support the southern states    Lincoln did not start the war to abolish slavery, he started(provoked) it to keep the Union together    The South left the union because they were affraid of unfair taxes and tariffs that the North would put on them so they left

QC9Md8uTaa	. "The house flinched." page 134    This means that the house shook quickly. No house could flinch because flinching is a human characteristic. Mr. Spinelli used this when the kids where playing football in the house. Their game was rough and the house could not take it.        2. "Within an hour or two the holiday would be bounding down the stairs and squealing 'round the tinseled trees of Two Mills." page 112      This means that the holiday spirit would come to Grayson and Maniac and be active around all of Two Mills. This is a personification because the holiday could not come bounding down the stairs or squealing around Two Mills. Mr. Spinelli used this to describe the festive holiday of Christmas that would be coming soon.         3. "During the night March doubled back and grabbed April by the scruff of the neck and flung it another week or two down the road." page 149       This means that at the time of the story it was April, yet it felt cold like March weather. Two Mills was surprised by March weather in April. Mr. Spinelli used these words to describe the March like weather in April.

WMNbGsoWaa	It's going to be difficult to not spend alot of money on your career.    You'll need head shots and build up a resume, so maybe start acting in your local theater. You can go into acting without an agent, but an agent just helps make it easier and less stressful since they help you find auditions. You usually don't pay an agent until you get paid, where they then take a certain percentage of what you earned.
94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	The last point.  Japan has a very small army, useful only for policing, and I THINK it's against their constitution to wage an agressive war.  This policy is being re-evaluated today, in the hopes Japan may militarily fight against terrorism.|`|ZmdIlkpQaa	Well, the phrasing is somewhat ambiguous, but Japan did not Establish its right to make war and maintain a military after WWII.  Japan specifically gave up any claims to be able to make war except in self defense, and its military became a small, tightly-local Defense Force with no ability to project power any significant distance.  It's a well armed force with very good equipment these days, but it is in no way capable of being used to impose Japan's will on another country, which was the whole idea.    The reason I said earlier that your phrasing was a bit off is that Japan did not try its own military for war crimes, nor did it establish a constitution or set up a parliamentary government.  All of those were done by the US authorities while occupying Japan.
Ahud6tPZaa	Bring hypothetical (that's a big word for "based on an assumption"), what if you'd got the role, and your car had broken down. What would you do? Call off, and cancel a whole day's shoot, at the expense to the company of all the other cast and crew who had turned up?    If you're serious about acting, then commitment alone would find a resolution to your transport problems. I've been in a similar situation to you, and my desire and dedication to my art drove me to find a solution, other than the easy phone call exit. I've worked on shoots with actors who have dragged themselves onto the set with flu, stomach upsets, etc., when they should have been home in bed. But they were there because they were dedicated, and didn't want to let the side down. That's the mark of a true actor.    Your agent is right in my opinion. You not turning up will lead the production team on the film to believe that she's not sending the most reliable of people, and the likelihood is they won't use her again to cast roles. Besides which, not turning up to a callback is like turning the job down. A casting director will not be willing to take the risk of hiring someone who doesn't turn up whenever their transport is out of order.|`|UAL5AXEXaa	Well, you could rent a car or go by plane, train or automoblie!(hahahaha! thats a movie) idk its not ur fault. tell her to stop making you feel guilty! maybe if she keeps being like that get a new agent!

zQZ2uz3Paa	Oh this is one of my favorite books!    Since I read it, I've always thought it was a true story and the "anonymous" writer died maybe due to drug use and her diary was found and published after her death. However, the story isn't entirely truthful. Actually, it is a fictional story written by a psychologist named Beatrice Sparks. Beatrice based her story on a diary written by one of her patients, but in reality this "Alice" didn't die.     So, in short: no, the diary isn't a real story, but it is loosely based on the diary of a real drug-addict.     Hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|V1x2UJpMaa	Yes, I've read it to and it was supposedly a fifteen-year-old drug user's diary, and was found by her parents after she overdosed.

0806e6e7cf26dee397f58421b5e679beaa	No, that's not a real macro lens, that focal length and aperture won't give good results, the minimum focusing distance is probably 5x longer than what a macro lens can focus.    First thing we need to know so we can give you a good answers is what camera have you got?    If you don't want to spend much money in an expensive macro lens I'd say buy close-up filters instead, much more practical and the image quality will be better than these cheap ones you're looking to buy on eBay, there is also a big chance that they may have dust inside it and sometimes haze or fungus, old third part lenses are not a good buy.    I use a close-up +3 on my 50mm and the results are superb.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	Always go in to some were you can try it on your Camera first, and see the Quality, I learned that the hard way.|`|bf6083ffadca74a66ca0bd4555eba2feaa	The M42 is an old screw thread mount and will need an adaptor for a modern bayonet-mount camera, possibly losing some of the auto functions on your camera; Optomax is also one of the budget ranges and the design is of the once popular one-touch design (zoom and focus using the same control).

Then, I bought books, studied, learned all the scales and modes and chords and then , went to Berklee where I graduated and taught there.    So there is no limit. You are doing the right think. Practice slowly and be clean,. Alternate pick all the time to begin. Then, listen to lots of music and try to play along with it.     Here is a good exercise to develop and strengthenyour fingers.    Do one finger per fret and alternate pick.    1-2-3-4-3-2-1  then...    1-2-1-2-3-2-3-4 and 4-3-4-3-2-3-2-1    Also, practice in other keys as well.    Here is a good link for you.

AA12058653	Do you know some HTML?   You could always create a page just for the photos in an album format, and "nest" the HTML code within your website. So for example, your homepage has links at the left for different photo albums or pages - when the link for your photo album is clicked, the page doesn't change, but the album will come up in the designated nested area.     Does that make sense?     I usually use a free program from jalbum.net to create my actual albums - it resizes the thumbnails and looks good, and all I really have to do is drag and drop. Hope that helps!

27qNNHvoaa	"Never did [...] this good turn" informs the reader that this lady wants something really bad. She knows what she wants, but she can't have it. "She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn" implies that this is something about which she is so passionate that it defies simple laws of nature. The last two lines of the stanza reveal that the thing she wants so badly is to kiss this "flint-hearted" boy who is obviously not giving her what she wants.    She goes on to say how she had been wooed by someone very powerful in the past and he (no pun intended) let his guard down for her. In the 3rd stanza, she describes the ways in which she tamed him... he gave up his powerful war stuff (lance, batter'd shield) in return for her love and affection.    In the next stanza she's kind of bragging about how she was able to manipulate even the "god of war." Then she goes on to tell this boy not to brag about how he has her, the woman who tamed the god of war, wrapped around his little finger.    The final stanza is pretty obvious, but in case you don't see it, she is making one last attempt to get him to kiss her.|`|nlbJAtuZaa	to tell you the truth i didnt read it.|`|4865uWgkaa	Ooh, I like Shakespeare but lazy to read his works.

(Nigeria's language was turned to English after British settlers arrived) It is a staple book in schools throughout Africa and widely read and studied in English-speaking countries around the world. It is seen as the archetypal modern African novel in English, and one of the first African novels written in English to receive global critical acclaim.

8asG4WCwaa	If a publisher is that desperate to find a client, you can bet they are not a traditional publisher.      Real publishers do not have to beg for manuscripts since agents provide them with enough good ones to choose from.     Vanity presses make their money selling printing services to naive authors (not by selling books to readers).  It annoys writing groups to find out a self publisher has copied their member list specifically to spam them with promises and half-thruths.|`|yj3GT7jOaa	I just started my own company and contracted a printing service.  You can get your own copyrights and ISBN number much less than what they will charge.  The key word is SELF publishing.  How can you hire someone to publish a book for you when you end up doing all the work anyway?  You may pick any printing service that claims to be a publisher.  Will your book be published or printed.  You decide and figure out who self is.    You give Xlibris or any other publisher the right to publish your work and it becomes their work by transfer unless you sell it to them. In a transfer, you both may publish the work.  That is what self-published really means.    Selling your work is not a good idea.  They will publish their work and you can no longer publish yours since you sold it to them.  No publisher can guarantee any work will be successful.|`|s1Hmw2Geaa	Hi Shelley;    You sound like an aspiring author, if so and you hope to become professional then please read on:    Before taking on self-publishing you need to ask yourself why you want your story in print.    If you are hoping to advance a career as a professional author (meaning you actually make it your profession and you get paid to write) then do not self-publish...you will be hurting your future. Media and traditonal booksellers will not take you seriously, and without the attention and support of the media and booksellers it is unlikely you will make any money whatsoever. Since the very start of professional publishing in the USA and UK, self-publishing has been known within the industry as "Vanity" publishing...this pretty well sums it up.    However, if you want to see your story in print just for the sake of giving out copies to friends and loved ones, then self-publish.    PS: the difference between a professional author/writer and one who is not, is difinitive.. professional means you earn your living at writing and you never pay a single cent to have your work published.

Actually jareyn you and are both correct... it was really the demands of the anti-Federalists which led to the creation of the Bill of Rights so I believe his role in the debate over the Constitution to be his most important.

People should learn to read before giving the thumbs down.|`|utbfT0APaa	NO,  Patrick Henry was one of the most outspoken opponents of the Stamp Act. On May 29, 1765, he introduced seven radical resolutions in the Virginia House of Burgesses. Five of the seven resolutions were adopted on May 30, though one was reconsidered the next day (after Henry's departure) and removed.     In May 1774, a message from the Massachusetts Committee of Correspondence informed Virginians of the closing of the port of Boston. The Virginia House of Burgesses set aside June 1, 1774, as a day of "Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer" in support of the citizens of Boston. Governor Dunmore dissolved the assembly, but 89 of the Burgesses gathered at the Raleigh Tavern and, under Henry's leadership, proposed that all the colonies meet in a Continental congress.     In April 1775, shortly after news reached Virginia that American colonists had clashed with British troops in Lexington, Massachusetts, Henry learned that Governor Dunmore had seized gunpowder from the Magazine in Williamsburg. Henry collected the militia of Hanover County and marched toward Williamsburg. He sent a message to the governor demanding that the gunpowder be returned to representatives of the colony. Governor Dunmore paid the Virginians money equal to the value of the powder, then issued a proclamation outlawing "a certain Patrick Henry" for disturbing the peace of the colony.

pEjitHlPaa	it does not surprise me ,because i know one fellow who is INDIAN and his wife was LIBYAN he bought for 10.000 us dolars about 10 years ago but when she came here in this country she ran away with a MORACON man she might be pragnet at that time but it was not sure. she got a son and both men were fighting for the son but no body wants the woman. the court did the decesion and she took the son and chose the third guy from pakistan.i have no more clue about now. well you said about a christian lady i am talking about a muslim woman and three muslim men from the third world.may be in INDIA it is still a matter of personal respact and dignity etc.thanks.|`|iKmkRaqBaa	Depends upon earlier consent .

6qsTmMQaaa	Everyone has their own way of expressing themselves. Some ways of expression, such as public speaking, are easier for some people, and for some (me being among the "some"), it is nearly impossible. However, other ways of expression, such as drawing and painting, are easier for some others, and are very, very hard for others.    To answer your other question, yes, there are infinite ways that people can express themselves. Everything, if you think about it, is an expression of oneself, one's emotions, one's feelings, etc. E-mailing a friend is an expression of who you are, for you can write in a certain way, and you can express your feelings through e-mail. Singing is another way of expression; you can sing your emotions, and you can have a distinct way of singing, which expresses who you are.    How do I express myself, you ask? I express myself mostly through writing, but also through videography, sketching, doodling, and drawing, and through quirky things I do in everyday life, like using pens and pencils as action figures. I express who I am through the clothes I wear, through the sports I play, through the classes I fail in and excel in, and through many, many other things that would take up too much space to write. I don't know of one other person who shares the same styles of expression as I do. Everyone has their own ways of expression; these are just some of my ways of expressing myself.    My underlying point in response to your question is that everything one person does is an expression of who they are, what they're feeling, etc.: the clothes they wear, the things they listen to, the sports they play, the paintings they paint, the doodles they doodle, and what have you, are all expressions of their own self-being and one's own emotion.|`|XxDQGEalaa	Talking, writing, playing guitar, or drawing are the  easiest ways for me.....or at least the first ways I turn towards.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	I love to express myself through music I write and just discussion with people that don't mind different opinions even if we disagree.And yes I do find it wondrous there are infinite ways to express ourselves but would have to question any person having a unique way of self -expression as there are billions of humans and am sure many express themselves quite the same.But you know what? You had an excellent question cause you just allowed many of us to express ourselves. Good One!!|`|mMnRmYvNaa	I do best in writing. No pressure. Get to think. Get to see what I've said so far -- very convenient.    I try to create architectured text, with an outline of structure, a logical plan, a word budget for each section, and a nice smooth flow.    I try to incorporate subtle humor, especially in briefs for Federal Agencies and Courts -- somebody has to read them you know-- might as well put a smile on their face if it can be done without impairing my meaning or distracting from my purpose. Judicial clerks have told me that sometimes my briefs are sent around the Circuit because they are funny to read.    Next best is speaking face to face, like to a friend or a jury. The pressure disappears after the first 20 years or so. You just look them in the eye, and talk like they're your neighbor.    Body language can be very eloquent if you do it right. On the street it can be the key to survival. At a party it can make you the Prince Charming. In a business meeting it can get you promoted or fired PDQ. It's all about posture and facial expression.    When I'm working with militant Jihadists, my preference is the 16 inch naval gun. It fires a shell about the weight of an Escalade, which can go about 20 miles (with no gas at all). Next best is the Predator launched air to ground soft-launched anti-personnel missile. It expresses my feelings very precisely and effectively. My audience only listens for a very short time though -- about 1/10,000 of a second, then their eyes glaze over, I guess they must be bored, or shot.    For real ease of expression, there's no substitute for a large blue white DeBeers diamond, or maybe two in a set of earings. She gets it right away, almost before I can get the box open. Nothing says blue white diamond like a blue white diamond. Nothing says it more clearly than a big, brilliance cut, nicely mounted one. I just really communicates two little words "I care". Once you have it in your pocket, it's real easy to express yourself with it. Getting one like that into your pocket -- that's not so easy -- that's where the caring comes in.|`|jMGyLvNsaa	There are infinite ways of express yourself, but each person is different, because of their personality and strengths so we express them differently.

Isn't it amazing how each individual has their own specific gift from God?

Expression may be manifest in any medium of communication: verbal, written, artistic, gesticulation or sheer facial expression.    Public speaking, debates, discussions, conversation are examples of verbal medium. Writing essays, articles or books fall under the written medium.  Artistic mediums can be visual arts or performing arts.  Visual arts include drawing, painting, photography etc. Dance, Music, Theatre etc. are examples of performing arts.  Before you ask for the easiest way to express yourself, you must first decide what medium you wish to express yourself in.    Once you decide that, be original and be natural.  There is no better way to express yourself.  It is effortless. Remember you are a unique person.  There is nobody else in the entire universe quite like you.  Be yourself and conquer the world with the expression of your unique personality. All the very best to you.|`|Cm3wJH4Waa	by doing nothing|`|AA11564934	speech
zztYBvaWaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with making up the names of characters for your book.  What really caught my eye is that you say you have no idea what your characters names "mean" because you made them up.  If that's the case, try Googling the name, or even checking a baby name web site to see if maybe it means something in another language.  If not, then that means you get to decided what the characters names will mean.       For example, I want to name my character Allicio.  I check Google, and that spelling tells me that there is an Australian skin care company named that.  So, that bothers me a little, I don't want someone to equate my character with skin care, so I change it a little.  Alicio, which does in fact have a meaning!  A baby name web site lets me know that it's a form of Alexander, and means "Warrior".  My character is a fighter, so it fits, and since the web site lets me know the name is very rare, it's not likely to pop up often enough.  So I settle, and decide that's the name I'm going with.      Again, the book is your idea, and ultimately, if you decide on a name for a character, that's the characters name.  What it means, or if it has a specific origin doesn't really matter, as long as you like the name.|`|bRtALY1Vaa	Yes , It's Your Book You Can Put Whatever Names You Want In Your Book!|`|yj3GT7jOaa	The names have been changed in this story and there are no innocent.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	Haha I like what the first guy said  Dylan  Mary|`|KaAXJJo8aa	of course :)|`|jh9iPYvXaa	Why not?

6SwaWSoyaa	Honestly I think you should shoot for a level four or five, because it will show that you have ambition. Also find an etude that has some fast parts and slow arts. Maybe one that starts out at Allegro or faster and in the middle it goes to Adante or slower and then back to at least Moderato or faster. With the adante speed part it will show how graceful you can be with your notes which are perfect for marching band ballads and then on the allegro it will show how crisp and solid you can play for the opener and closing song.

A public figure has some kind of function that affects thousands people, whereas the private citizen has no effect on anybody except his own family and circle of friends.  This difference has always existed in the language spoken.  In Latin for example there is a word for private enemy for a private citizen, and the public enemy of the nation.    This in turn does not mean that the assassinated person is superior to the private citizen or more intelligent.  It is just a question of terminology.  I find your question very relevant, pertinent, and interesting.  As for murder cases, and assassinations, yes someone has to pay for what they did, if they have done it.  No one has the right to take the life of someone else.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	There isn't really one exact definition.  The answer you get will depend to a degree who you ask.  In the most literal sense it's 'philo-' meaning love, plus '-sophy' meaning wisdom. A love of knowledge.    A more practical definition I like is that it is an attempt to get at the truth by questioning in a systematic and reasonable way and making as few leaps of faith as possible.    You may note that this sounds a lot like scientific study... this is no accident. All sciences were once just branches of philosophy, and most are even now known as 'natural philosophy'.  If you take the 'why' out of science, all you have is a recording of facts with no explanation or wonder (reminds me of some horrible history books I've read). Indeed, why would anyone even WANT to record data unless it was to answer a philosophical question?    That leaves pure philosophy with questions that science can't possibly tackle.  Like 'is the scientific method always best' or ones about ethics, logic, purpose, and so on.  These can sometimes seem airy to some people, but they are the foundations upon which most lawyers and by extention politics and governments are founded on.  Important stuff!    Hope that helps!  Peace.|`|4l2q4n1Baa	Its basically the history and the study of the meaning of life.  Its such a broad subject.  It asks every deep question from why we exist to what is moral.      I've taken 3 philosophy courses so far =)    Deep stuff.|`|76ACQGyFaa	The first general answer is: "Philosophy is about questions." But then science and theology  and "common sense" and superstition and "mom and dad and your friends"  give answers to questions too. So what's special with philosophical answers?    The first divide is between philosophy and religion: Religion states for instance: "In the beginning God created heaven and earth." And then the philosopher unsatisfied asks: "How do the priests and the Holy Scriptures came to know that  have they been there?" and then "What do they mean by 'God'?" And next he may think them to be liars who try to scare the people to make them well behaved and obedient to the priests and elders and the king.    The second divide is between philosophy on the one hand and experience and "common sense" on the other: Where do people get their "knowledge"? That was the concern of Socrates. He said "Nobody knows anything for sure. I don't know anything too. But at least I know this one thing and I am not boasting I know anything for sure or going to sell it." Now that is an extreme position from which the sceptics started. Plato was not that modest and he invented the metaphysical concept of "ideas". How do we know that some way of acting or thinking is "better" than another way if we had not some inborn idea of what acting and thinking should be "ideally". Aristotle thought this to be an unnecessary and unjustified conclusion: By everyday experience we know that all things can be done in a stupid and clumsy way and in a masterly way. But to know that one doesn't need the concept of "ideas". So this was one of the first struggles between two first-class philosophers.So philosophy is a really great undertaking of some of the best human minds. An undertaking to achieve what? To clear our understanding and our arguments concerning the world around us  and our way of arguing  from false pretensions and false presumptions, from misleading concepts and misleading lines of thought to get at a true picture of the world we live in.    "A" true picture is not "the" true picture. There are many true pictures of the world as there are many true pictures of a person or a landscape or of anything else. But there are many false and distorted and misleading pictures too. There's no contradiction in this.|`|KvyB0E77aa	B.S.
lVKwnFvjaa	The war started in 1914 and ended in 1918. The US didn't get involved until either 1917 or 1918, so many of the major battles had already occurred.    However the battles for the Western Front in France and Belgium were still raging and the Yanks contributed greatly to the allies winning there and ending the war.    PS:  We Aussies were there in 1914 and in WW11 in 1939 when it started.  The US didn't physically enter the 2nd war until after Pearl Harbour had been attacked in Dec. 1941, arriving in  Europe and North Africa in early 1942. That war ended in 1945.    So the US had the reputation of always waiting until after half time to join a fray, but, even so, essential to Allied victory.    Hopefully if there is a third WW, you lot will be there from  the beginning, preferably not by having started the bugger!    PPS:  Another amusing anecdote that came out of WW2 was:  "When the Germans fired the British ducked, when the British fired the Germans ducked, and when the Americans fired, everyone ducked".     That's a joke (sort of) so please don't be offended.|`|31N7XIohaa	battle of somme    http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Where_were_the...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_t...|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	I would say Chateau-Thierry.  Although some US units had been parceled out to help French units before, Chateau-Thierry was the first deployment of multi-divisional US forces operating together.  Together with the French on their flank, they stopped a late German offensive, then went over to the attack at the Second Battle of the Marne.  By this time, some 10,000 fresh America troops were arriving in France evey day.  The battle of Chateau-Thierry, although not decisive in itself, showed the Allies that American forces had entered the fight in great numbers.  It showed the worn-out Germans the same thing, and that many more were coming into the fight.  And it showed the Americans -- not that they had any doubt -- that they could stand up to the enemy, take the fight to him, and win.  Footnote  before some Jarhead raise it: among the American forces at Chateau-Thierry was a Marine Brigade.

But you should say "I`m fatigued" instead of "I`m at fatigue", "i'm don't want you anymore" should be 'I don't", and I noticed you were repetitive at times- use more of a variety of words. I would also suggest using puntuation (ie: capital letters, periods, etc.). You change rhyme scheme multiple times which makes your meter strange and hard to understand. The rythm is also off. And maybe add more description of what you see, smell, taste, etc., to create a better visual image for the reader(s).

ZmdIlkpQaa	They did not wish to provoke the Soviets, and those areas were already firmly under Soviet control.|`|5u1092wzaa	Ask yourself why didn't the Soviet Union stop the Chilian golpe, the Korea war, the Vietnam war, apart from all other pressures in Middle and South America, Africa and Asia?  Two big "superpowers" could never collide directly, if they did not want make real war. That is why they called it "cold war".  Therefore, I would choose none of the above mentioned answers, although the second is somehow closer to my idea. Who inspired you the fourth, by the way?

France had also invaded under Napoleon.  Moreover, there were a fair number of British and American Generals (George Patton most vocal among them) that were pressing to do just that.  They saw the Soviet Union as a threat, and wanted to press ahead, and crush the Russians.  Considering the technological advantages (most especially the atomic bomb), it's possible it could have been successful, although one has to suspect that the war weary civilians of both Britain and the US would likely not have supported such a move, no matter how much sense it made.|`|596cb0e83ef32238ab39c7938f21bbd9aa	As the story goes, The west was at odds with the Soviets after WWII. When Germany invaded Russia during WWII, Many in the west were delighted that our worst enemies were tied up in a battle between themselves. Russia was very much aware of this. After WWII the Soviets were exhausted. The USA had the Atomic bomb and were not as exhausted as the US, the UK, etc. It was talked about (by the West) but it was never acted on. The USSR, did prepare for an invasion by the Western powers but it never came.     It has a tantalizing appeal. There was a worn out Soviet Union in 1945. East Europe was a hot bed of anti Soviet efforts. It had no real allies at this time. What if we had????? The cold war might never have happened. Just a thought.     So far you seem to answering your own question.
ZmdIlkpQaa	The Chinese Civil War was a long, drawn out affair, and throughout the Second World War, when Japan was fighting against China, the civil war continued.  In 1949, the Communists finally managed to break the exhausted Nationalist forces and drive them to Taiwan, and installed themselves as the new government of China.

One book I really liked is Run Baby Run. Here's a review...    "Nicky Cruz is a violent, out-of-control young boy who is sent to New York to live with his older brother in 1950's Brooklyn. A Puerto Rican immigrant with no respect for authority or any knowledge of the English language, Nicky drops out of school within weeks of arriving in New York and is driven out of his brothers' home as well.     Nicky finds himself desperate with no food or a place to live, and he nervously commits his first robbery to survive. On the streets with no friends or family to turn too, Nicky eventually joins the infamous 'Mau Mau' street gang, who become his 'family'. Nicky would spend several years in the gang, being its President during the gangs' most violent and often recorded period of criminal activity in the mid to late 1950's.     In 1958, a Pennsylvania preacher named David Wilkerson meets with the Mau Mau's and is nearly killed by Nicky, who decides to attend one of Wilkersons' arena meetings so that the gang can rob the offering. Instead, Wilkerson moves Cruz to attempt to abandon his violent, drug and sex filled gang existence and change his life into something positive."

wCaFESnfaa	They all seem fine.    edit--  for the people that say theres a problem with the 16 and 21...  There are many many relationships with a 5 year range. Reguardless if its legal or not, it happens.|`|XghG4z6haa	well 14&14 if you want it to be like a teenage kind of love that's not that serious.  14 &16 if you want it to just be a regular typical kind of love  and 17 & 18 if you want it to be a little more serious|`|K1kZlWY8aa	They seem alright, two definitely needs to be changed though:  16 & 21. Too much of a gap. It is illegal. A 16 year old cannot go out with an adult!!

This is a five year difference and one is under 18 one is over.  14 & 16 - This one's fine.  12 & 14 - Uh... This might be little inappropriate but as long as it's not too serious this should be fine.  15 & 16 - This one's fine.  That's my opinion!|`|GR2XNzCCaa	16/21 isn't good unless it is a drama story and one character is gonna go to jail. :P Or if the 16 year old wants the 21 year old, but it's never gonna happen.    Otherwise, all those ages are good.|`|FNwYzjogaa	Well 16 and 21 is technically illegal and socially taboo.    13 and 16 is odd because at that age it is a huge difference. When you are older three years isn't much but when you are a teenager it is. The maturity difference is immense.    Jane- The younger the people the greater the age difference seems and the more impact it has on the relationship. A 31 year old  dating someone who is 35 doesn't seem bad but an eleven year old dating a six year old is. The younger the ages the wider the age gap is. There are relationships with age differences greater than five years but they generally occur between older people.

CzdxFiRLaa	Why restrict your choice to just christian colleges?  Select a college that has a great photo course, major in photojournalism and join a christian group at the college, if that is your scene.      The whole concept of tertiary study is to learn and gain experience and confidence.  Your creativity will develop with you studies, you will learn from others and ideas will overflow.  As for any exhibition, yes it is is a challenge, stressful and at times difficult.  But being a photojournalist is no picnic either.      If photography is you passion, then go for it, the rest will flow with your experience and learning.    Good luck,    David
afWoScNbaa	Look up monologues at home and practice them in front of your mirror. Or get a video camera and tape yourself. Then look back on the tapes and see what works and what doesn't.     As for modeling(runway), get some high heels and walk down your hallway.    For pictures, pose in front of the mirrors and try to reenact the good posses in front of a camera. If your serious about modeling, you should read up on name brands and "learn the lingo".|`|GsKIZZPwaa	if u have a cam corder..record urself sumtiems with friends and pretend ur acting n makin a show. or record a fashion show so ur actin n modelin at the same time. practice poses i nthe mirro too ;]|`|4GmeIopoaa	Writing your own scripts and practicing in the Mirror.

If you get a part in a stage or screen production then you could and should practice your lines, the way you say them and your facial expressions. For acting you just need to make sure that you put yourself in the role as much as possible. You don't have to over analyze things but just make sure that your heart and mind are fully committed to the character. You are the character. For modeling you should just make sure that you know your body and the way it moves. Like when i smile my eyes squint a little so i have to make sure to relax my eyes when I'm taking photos. In the end you should just be comfortable with yourself for both acting and modeling. I hope this helps :)|`|KSWeYE4haa	Buy a run way and look TOTALY FABU!!!!!!|`|10f326a8d361451c48ca6d61e9c457e0aa	Use any old video recorder and play against yourself.

f6NcTZyBaa	I have the same problem as you.I can come up with the BEST ending in the world, but I can't add to it.What I found that helps is just when you get character ideas or whatever, write them.Write down ALL of you ideas.Write the character's name and their charcteristics and looks.After you have that, just add to it when the idea comes to you.Like write it in a notebook and keep it with you.Throw it in your purse, whatever.Do not sit and think for hours.That does not help, trust me.Like I said, when ideas come, write them down and when you have another idea write thta one down.Slowly add them together and soon enough, you will have a bunch of ideas.Make a way to fit all the ideas together.When you have evrything then start putting it together and make an outline or, if you're really confident, start writing.Good luck!|`|f9oNyEV7aa	I've written four novels and share your feeling of frustration. I have begun dozens of stories only to pitch them because the plot doesn't develop. But, out of those dozens, eight have emerged - grabbed my attention and interest.  I just begin writing the story, allowing the characters to shape the opening chapter(s). When I get two or three chapters into the story, I stop and read the story into an audio program and listen to it. Ideas and plots begin to rise from the mist as if by magic. (But I have to like the characters and the interaction).|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Read - a lot. Anything, everything. Then once you've finished the book think about the plot. What did you like? How would you have changed it? Did that final plot twist totally catch you off gaurd? Reread the whole book or just passages to answer questions like; How was the killer hinted at? How did the author foreshadow *element of the plot*?    Take a walk and let your mind relax. If you worry too much about coming up with a good plot, you won't come up with even a rotten plot. You've got to relax and get your mind off it once in a while.    Take inspiration from your dreams. Many, MANY, authors base their books off dreams or nightmares they've had. And if you are one of the few people who can write any genre for any age, you can even use that dream about the giant blue carrot that tried to take over the world (come on, how fun would that be for a young kid's book?).    When you come up with a character write down everything about him/her and sketch a picture if you can. Then sit down and think about him/her. Why does he feel this, why does she think that, etc. Then make up little stories about them and write them down. They don't have to be good or make much sense here. And this is going to sound crazy, but sit back and listen to your characters. Pretend you're talking to them and interview them about their life.     Free write. This is where you set a timer for, say, 5 minutes and write. You can't stop until the timer goes off even if you can't think of anything and end up writing the same 5 scentences a hundred times each. Do this every day, or at least a few times a week. It really will help.|`|FK0Lc696aa	How?    I don't really know "how", per se.   Plots just pop up. Well, for me, anyways.   An idea would come, and I would just kind of branch out. For instance, let's say the idea "Shellie was reading a book" came to me. I would create a branch to that idea, such as "the book pulled her into an undersea world", and continue with ideas for that theory. On another branch, I would write "That book just so happened to be the '___' that the '____' are looking for, and they start trailing her for it", and then branch out all the possibilities of that choice of direction. I would continue it for a while, until I had at least a couple of directions for the story, and then I would pick out some of my favorite ideas and try to piece them together.     Sometimes, and idea would just come, and it would be so solid that I would work on it, rather than try to mess with it. I've never  completed a novel before, but I write short stories and fan fiction, and this is how it usually goes.     Also, it helps to create a character, and then just ask yourself where would you like to see him or her.     Good luck!|`|AA10732775	People-watch is my favorite. We are always talking of our successes and failures; triumphs and losses. Take an event and fit your characters in it.    When all else fails, use a plot generator online. There's probably thousands of them- they can give you scenes, storylines, one line to start a story, etc.    http://www.maddogproductions.com/plotoma...  http://www.seventhsanctum.com/index-writ...    Seventh Sanctum is the best you will find. They've got generators for-  Anime/Manga  Art  Beings  Characters  Combat  Darkness/Evil  Equipment  Humor  Magic  Media/Fandom  Names  Organizations  Setting  Superheroes/Sentai  Skills/Abilites/Traits   Technology  Writing   Random Generator    I'd go for the story generator-  http://www.seventhsanctum.com/generate.p...  I told it to give me one "free-for-all" story. Here's what I got- "This is a psychology piece. The story is about a bitter salesperson. It starts in a post-apocalyptic police state on a world of magic. The crux of the story involves the paying of a fine. A terrible monster and the need to stop it is a major element of the story."  So you could fit one of your characters in as the salesperson, and boom!

Advanced scientific revolution.  2) Galileo - He did absolutely everything - physicist, mathematician, astronomer, philosopher.  3) Andres Vesalius - I mean, he practically founded modern human anatomy, but I'm not sure of any other works.  4) Nicolaus Copernicus - Great milestones in astronomy, but I feel others were more influential.  5) William Harvey - Brilliant works about the heart and circulation, however I feel other people could have worked it out.|`|KvyB0E77aa	Isaac Newton - most  Vesalius - least|`|2DLqsVFcaa	most important: n. copernicus    Copernicus broke the ice with his findings.  Galileo and newton,  based all of their findings off of copernicus's work.  remember Galileo was born after copernicus;  newton was born when Galileo died.   with the other two;  least important was harvey.  he continued the work andres started.  astronomers/mathematicians before anatomist.|`|gb1BGP8xaa	Important in terms of what?    History? Science?  Their families?  Your homework?      You need to be more specific in your question.|`|17w5Sqaaaa	Most important is Newton because he discovered gravity and gravity is what keeps us standing or standing.  It is very helpful to complete daily tasks:)  There is no least important because all of them made very important contributions to science, Newton is the most important, i think.
e2ef8eb9de4adb8670567c6052f48287aa	not sure honey umm i mean you are cute but to be a professional model you have to have distinctive features, that's for runways and top magazines and agencies    you could try the promotions industry, you will still model of course, ( do adverts and things like that, it will give you experience too) and it's suitable for your age , when you grow up, you'll grow into your face, it will reveal your real beauty and then i'm positive that you have a shot! =)    greetings darling!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	maybe a hand model? anything that dosant involve your face|`|DCeAcP7kaa	Yeah sure.|`|MGjMjWwaaa	yeah but you would need to grow taller|`|Wb1DzxdPaa	try again when youre 18|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	yes, but you should gets some highlights in your hair to frame your face.|`|HhY4Oul2aa	umm well our skinny enough(btw how do u stay so skinny any dieting?)  and also 5'4? that might not work out because i was told i could be a model but i am 5'4 also so i cldnt be but i hate the look to be one  and pretty enough so i was upset when i found out i was to short. you can try      goodluck|`|Hqan62xzaa	Too Young!|`|MpG8n0vMaa	u look like a model  soo yeah|`|4sysVIojaa	gotta be tall|`|0haWIfVMaa	Sure, but not runway, you have to be at least 5'10 or they don't even consider you.|`|lCaVsjESaa	to be honest, i highly doubt a girl as young as you would be happy as a model.

If you do give it a go make sure you don't neglect your studies and that you have something to fall back on. Even in the best of circumstances modeling is a difficult career.

But there are quick fixes to become taller. they may make you wear really high heels to make up for the height. but i think you got it going for you with your looks. maybe try a fiercer look in your pics. good luck and hope it works out for you!|`|FH8hgxpgaa	it really depends on what kind of modeling you want, but if its really what you feel like doing you should go for it and try to find a job just stay safe and don't get pressured by the people to change your self because it is a tuff industry so keep up your self esteem and stay healthy, good luck.|`|47jcyMbOaa	I think you'd make an awesome model! Model's can be any age, shape and size. You can begin to build a portfolio now, and work your way up to larger projects. Practice by taking pictures of  yourself, then when you feel confident find a photographer in you area. You can sometimes photographers that are willing to do a TFCD or TFP which means you give them your time, and they give you a free cd with your photos or free print outs. Always take a friend or someone with you when meeting photographers and on photo shoots. Also make sure they have a model release form, which basically states that you know they are using your photos for their portfolio and vise versa.   Also don't think you have time be stick thin to model. Be you, and be healthy. Natural is beauty.    Hope this helps.  ~Samantha  www.myspace.com/leavesinwind
ondvZo8oaa	you get an agent. That's how. You get an agent, training and experience. Otherwise, you'll never get on disney. Sorry but that's the truth. People who have no training/experience will 99% of the time not get picked for disney, and people who have no training, experience, and no agent will most likely never get picked for disney.|`|YVUSvCuWaa	Well to be able to be a actress and be in shows/movies/videos/and ect , you have to go on http://www.disney-channel-auditions.com/ .

062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	It is not a picture, it looks like some photoshopped work-in-progress with a lot of amateurish cutting and pasting and some distracting text.  There is no point commenting on it photographically, as the original photo had been altered in many ways.  From what little I can see, I think it may have had good lighting. Again cannot say for certain as you didn't provide a link to the original picture.|`|lzOqcGgUaa	no|`|uo0DUadOaa	I think so. =D|`|AA11983200	no not really.    try harder next time & think out side of the box w/ your editing.    x|`|H2cMlG9Kaa	i really like the idea and how it came out, but some small details need to be fixed.  nice use of lettering  nice enclosure  nice gradient used  needs to be cropped better, use more feathering next time, your hair looks roughly cropped, fake.  the green eyes are a very nice effect, but they look way too fake. try to make it less green, lower the opacity of the color to make the eye details pop out and make it look more realistic and prettier that way.

WYngdeacaa	Albert Einstein was not an inventor.  He was not an engineer.  He didn't invent anything.  He was a theoretical physicist.  He developed several theories that expanded the bounds of physics.    He won the Nobel Prize for his theory of the Photoelectric Effect.  Here, he showed that light has the properties of both energy and matter.    He also developed the theory of relativity and the special theory of relativity.    His most famous formula was E=MC2    (C2 means the speed of light to the second power).  E means energy and M means Mass.  Its basically a formula for turning matter into energy and back again.    Einstein's theories led to many inventions, not the least of which was the atomic bomb, but he did not directly participate in any of their creations.|`|mnIeK8q6aa	Albert Einstein wasn't an inventor, but a theorist. He came up with the relativity theory. That is not an invention, but the theory that makes inventions possible.
F43ynVGdaa	Well I liked "the clique" and I also enjoyed reading 'the mediator" series by Meg Cabot. I highly recommend it.     The story is about a girl named Susannah Simon, a.k.a. Suze, who is a mediator, which means she can see and talk to ghosts and when necessary, hurt them. Suze spends a lot of time directing the usually unhappy dead to the afterlife. However, her job is not easy, as not all ghosts want to be guided. Everyday she is haunted by the fact that they will not leave her alone until she helps them resolve their unfinished business with the living.     2. Twilight  I loved this book, I'm sure your daughter will too if she's into romance.    Bella moves to Forks to live with her dad after her mom gets married again. She meets Edward Cullen, but he tells her she should stay away from him and stuff after he saves from getting hit by a van. But then they just stop trying to avoid each other and fall in love. Then Bella finds out that Edward and his family are vampires. And they are playing baseball when some other vampires come into town. One of them decides he is going to track Bella and kill her. So then Edward and his family has to save her. They save her after James has bit her and Edward has to suck out the venom.      3. Noughts and Crosses    The book noughts and Crosses is the first book of a trilogy. Set in a parallel world very much like our own, the only difference is that the two races are known as noughts and Crosses, and the dark-skinned Crosses discriminate against the lighter-skinned noughts.    The book revolves around the lives of Callum and Sephy, two teenagers and best friends. However, their parents discourage them being together as Callum is a nought and Sephy is a Cross. The two are determined to preserve their delicate relationship but in a world where any sort of relationship between noughts and Crosses is shunned, it is easier said than done.    This is one of my favourite books as it is extremely thought-provoking and addresses all sorts of racial and moral issues. I like the little touches all through the book that quietly remind you of the society Callum and Sephy live in (for example the fact that the word Cross is capitalised while nought is not). This attention to detail makes this book an absorbing read.    4. 1-800-where-r-u  about a girl that gets struck by lightning and turns psychic. The series is written under her pen name Jenny Carroll. There are 4 books in the series and all really good. Also, there is her Boys series "Every Boy's Got One," "Boy Next Door," and "Boy Meets Girl." These books don't really have anything to do with each other (except that the characters all work at the same company) but are written in the same style - through emails, IMs, personal journals, and occasionally on scraps of napkins or menus. Also very good but more adult.    Highly recommend books by Meg Cabot.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	Don't get her into those books  Try to get her to read books that educate her mind.  Some of my former friends read those books.  They don't seem to care about anything besides living lives they can't live  and fashion.  Fashion is important but it should be .appreciated separately  If she's around 13 encourage her to read good books|`|kv2sMwfoaa	Look at the Bard Academy series by Cara Lockwood.

s3WdcVknaa	thats the best poem ive ever heard|`|aCP9JBXQaa	that's really good.     My Love For You  The sun rises over the hills,  And shines down on the lake.  The water is still, blue, and clear.  The clouds gently roll by,  Casting shadows on the cold green grass.    I slowly lay down.  The grass is cool and relaxing.  You lay down next to me and smile.  Your smile is so lovely.  The most beautiful thing in my world.     You hold my hand gently.  Your fingers slowly weave through mine  And you hold my face in your smooth palm.  Your lips have a smile on them.     It is a smile that sets my world alight.   Before you,  My life was dull and dreary.  But then you came into it.  Your eyes ever so green,  And your hair the fairest of brown.    But your smile was the one thing that I noticed.   It was the smile that kept me going when I was sad.  It was you that held me when I needed to cry,  And it was you who gave me my first kiss.  You are my gift in life.   My love for you will never change,  Never be broken.  Every promise will be kept.  Every smile is one we will share.     And when you need me and I need you,  We will always be there for each other.  You are my center, my world, my love.
RYVDDzX7aa	page 75 "I'm simply defending a Negro-- his name's Tom Robinson.  He lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump.  He's a member of Calpurnia's church, and Cal knows his family well.  She says they're clean-living folks. Scout, you arent old enough to understand some things yet, but there's been some high talk around town to the effect that I shouldnt do much about defending this man.  It's a peculiar case -- it wont come to trial until summer session.  John Taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement.." hope that helps

1kfTm6Svaa	Hey. Can I have permission to write this into a song for my band? It's really good.|`|k5OQQt2vaa	I`m going to have to (sort of) agree with "Aplogizer" in the fact that your 'poem' sounds more like a song. The meter and inconsistant rhyme just make it more song material. A very good song though, of course! I love the concept! :)    Seperate it into stanzas and organize it better if you want it to be a suffecient poem---in my opinion!|`|EGQqPnDcaa	woww i wish i could write like that,  your really good (:|`|QmOfd5evaa	it's good writing, but i think you focused too much on what you wanted to say and not enough on how it sounded.|`|NYqivyA2aa	omg your an awesome poet write a book seriously|`|1tPM6SCNaa	you have alot of time on your hands, wish i could be like you or even have half the time :)|`|50HTGzrlaa	GOOSE BUMPS!

gnukPLBvaa	I may be off a little on my timeframe, but I think the russian mafia started in the time youre refering to.     The Vor Zakone, or "thief in law" (i think thats what it means...) was born out of desperation for food and other things under the rule of the Tsars. It started out as a means for russians to feed their families, and grew more organized and ruthless as time went on.     I know that there was a movie involving the russian mob that came out a while back that cheapens the facts, Eastern Promises I think.     The real story is far more interesting. I think doing a paper on the history of the russian mob and its origins would be a cool topic. But again, I cant remember the time period exactly, it may or may not fit into your papers requirements.   Good luck.|`|jg1pllGIaa	Some interesting people to write about would be Peter I (the Great), Catherine the Great, Nikolai Gogol, Leo Tolstoy, or Dostoevsky like you said.  You could write about the Russian army. Here's a really good site about it: http://napoleonistyka.atspace.com/Russia...  or what about the Cossacks? or maybe you can do something about Napoleon getting defeated by the Russians.  I once wrote a paper on the Russian colonies in the United States.. Did you know that they got as far as Hawaii? :)  Well, I hope this helped you. Good luck!
r9s0VyJgaa	No.    If you want to do your own improvised solos, you MUST learn scales, and which scales can be used to play over which chords.  You must know which scales and chords go in what keys, and be able to play in any key, anywhere on the fingerboard.  You need to understand music theory, IOW.    You won't learn that by learning songs off of tab.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	No ,you need to learn the different sound each string makes|`|afWoScNbaa	Maybe, if you learn the strings as well|`|ycIMOWqDaa	yes you will. I myself am getting better and my inspiration is from my friend. He has been teaching himself how to play guitar and the only thing he has been doing is going onto ultimate-guitar.com and uses tabs to play songs. Slowly but surely you will become great.|`|3mfyNseSaa	i hope so! that's what i'm going lol. here's a great link to a site that has lots of free lessons. check it out. it's helped me alot. the biggest thing is building your finger strength/coordination and not to give up. good luck.  http://guitar.about.com/od/guitarlessons...|`|Z0e3RqB5aa	yes, but you will need to develop an ear for the notes so you can play anything. but with harder songs, you will learn different techniques and be more efficient in your playing naturally.
862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Basically, for 3/4 of the book, Bella is crying.    Seriously, that's it.    There is this one youtube explanation that is perfect, hold on, I'll go find it.  ---  Warning, some spoilers, but if you know the basic premise of the book, it ruins nothing  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCqOJ_OOG...|`|RyDWXeYcaa	if u read twilight u should deffiniatly read new moon.Its kind of the hardest of the 4 books to read (kinda sad) but its worth it,u really should read all of them.;)|`|XgVVEKTWaa	Its hard to explain without spoiling the story for you, but it is sort of vital if you are going to read the whole series. It is very sad, but is alright in the end. If you really liked Twilight, you'll want to read this.     Why not borrow a copy from a friend or a library? That way if you like it, you can buy it, if not you haven't wasted any money.     Here is whats written on the blurb just to give you a bit of an idea:    ---------------------------------  "Shoot," I muttered when the paper sliced my finger; I pulled it out to examine the damage. A single drop of blood oozed from the tiny cut.     It all happened very quickly then.     Edward threw himself at me, flinging me back across the table...     I tumbled down to the floor by the piano, with my arms thrown out instinctively to catch my fall, into the jagged shards of glass. I felt the searing, stinging pain that ran from my wrist to the crease inside my elbow.     Dazed and disoriented, I looked up from the bright red blood pulsing out of my arm-into the fevered eyes of the six suddenly ravenous vampires.     ****     For Bella Swan, there is one thing more important than life itself: Edward Cullen. But being in love with a vampire is even more dangerous than Bella could ever have imagined. Edward has already rescued Bella from the clutches of one evil vampire, but now, as their daring relationship threatens all that is near and dear to them, they realize their troubles may be just beginning...     Legions of readers entranced by the New York Times bestseller Twilight are hungry for the continuing story of star-crossed lovers, Bella and Edward. In New Moon, Stephenie Meyer delivers another irresistible combination of romance and suspense with a supernatural twist. Passionate, riveting, and full of surprising twists and turns, this vampire love saga is well on its way to literary immortality.   -----------------------------------    Have a good day! :)|`|w3yrnDEiaa	It is just Bella fawning over Edward again. Nothing new|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Bella goes emo after Edward leaves.    He comes back and they resume their abusive relationship.    The End.|`|FIFoGNIxaa	New Moon ( aka: the 2nd book of the series ) is about   Edward leaving Bella after an incident happens at her   birthday party with the Cullens. She starts to hang out   with Jacob her old friend while Edward is gone.     By the way: Softcovers are $10        I think only hardcovers cost that much|`|ue7sKvLOaa	Basically...Edward leaves Bella because he doesn't want to hurt her and all that crap, so New Moon focuses more so on the relationship between Jacob and Bella. Edward comes back, of course.  And Bella as a manic depressive. Can't forget about that part.      I would get it out of a library or borrow it from a friend before you buy it.  I wasted $25 on the fourth book.|`|y2KWnWKaaa	Another fun read! When Edward decides he has put Bella's life in danger, he and his vampire family leave the town of Forks, in hopes that Bella will be safe and move on with her life. Bella, however, realizes that the love of her life is gone for good, and falls into a deep depression. Only Jacob, a lifelong family friend, (who has a major crush on her) can reach her troubled spirit. New Moon has a lot of action and romance, plus who can resist a love triangle as Bella is torn between Edward and Jacob! On to book 3!|`|t2YNRxOKaa	bella - oh no, edward left *cries 3/4 of the book*  jake - lemme confort you bella. i love u more than the stinky vampire  bella - but i LOVE edward   edward - i cnt live w/o bella. lemme go commit suicide b/c i think bella is dead  bella - no, edward. here i am  edward - yay  jake - darn  the end. lol.    but dnt take me the wrong way. im an OBSESSED twilight fan. but new moon made me really sad and i cried ALOT when i was reading it b/c some of the stuff related to me. you need to read new moon to understand eclipse and breaking dawn. so read it |`|7vKgbSRkaa	It is more with Jacob then Edward. I know i hate it to.WHY JACOB? Eclipse is wayyyy better.Breaking dawn is INCREDIBLE|`|LHFRFW06aa	It's about the concequence after Edward left which was that bella befriended a werewolf(jacob black(HOTT))and it introduced peeps to the volturi The best damn vamps around.Any questions?|`|H2cMlG9Kaa	SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!  bella is emo!!!!  she and edward break up.  she cries and cries and cries and we have to listen to her ***** and moan about how her life sucks for like half of the book, because edward "left a hole in her".  she and jacob turn friendly.  victory starts causing trouble  jacob turns into an awesome werewolf but starts acting like an ******.  bella somehow finds out edwards gonna kill himself.   she arrives just in time to save the day and just completely forgives him and takes him back into her arms in lovey dovey love.    the volturri thing is awesome though! :3  vampires that want to turn bella into a vamp and want the cullens to join their army/coven.  if you read it, make sure to read the beginning, skip half the book, and then read the ending chapters.
zxQT3Uo5aa	He can accept someone else loving her because he understands his love for her.  He understands what one may feel for her especially if she responds (your dear fingers clutch his heart) as he has felt such feeling for her that he is lost for words (uttering overmuch).  The refrain (emphasis) is "it may not always be so".  He is hoping just the opposite or if it is that it will not last.  He does not want to lose her.    Acceptance (refrain) "if this should be".  He has reasoned within himself that it may turn out this way.  He will congratulate the man, if she tells him that she has fallen in love with someone else and bow out although he will be heart broken.

31N7XIohaa	To achieve elimination, powerful purgatives, laxatives, and emetics were used to produce diarrhea or vomiting.    The chief aim of many therapies was to bring back the balance through depletion, elimination, or blistering. Depletion was obtained by venesection, or bloodletting. It was thought to reduce inflammation and tension in the blood vessels.     For blistering, a glass cup was heated over a flame and applied directly to the skin. The blister that resulted would normally seep fluid, which was seen as the right result.This approach fit well with the medicinal use of plants because finding a plant that makes someone urinate, sweat, vomit, salivate, or develop diarrheas is not difficult.    Surgery was limited to structural emergencies as fractures, amputations and cutting for stone. Surgeons also took care of skin conditions, but played no role in internal medicine.     The study of anatomy involved the occasional examination of the bodies of criminals or suicides.     Moral taboos excluded male practitioners from obstetrics. Obstetrical matters were handled by midwives, who were trained on the job, and through traditional knowledge passed on by others.    http://c99.e2bn.net/e2bn/leas/c99/school...  http://www.thecaveonline.com/APEH/17cent...  http://www.stmaryscity.org/History/Medic...
tyWacgrGaa	'True values are what you suffer for'  That's mildly depressing. If I understand correctly, you are implying that you will constantly suffer if you hold any true values what so ever. It does make sense though...     'Not what you have suffered for'  This contradicts your first statement...kinda. But allow you to come into me: If you steadily suffer it is all one big suffering, there for it is not viewed as 'what you suffered for' because you remain suffering (though you have suffered for that same value in the past). Hmmmm    'Not what you will suffer for'  Like the above quote, the idea of constant suffering applies to this quote too, it's a matter of achieving the right perspective to make sense of the statement. I like it man, makes me think.    In response:  The more Truth you know the more alone you are with what you know. Ignorance is convenient, and is the road most traveled. The pursuit of Truth is something I suffer for.|`|AA11564934	So if u were in jail being tortured for 10 years for your "values", they're not really your values if u aren't being tortured right now?    ridiculous.|`|AA11635601	I think the statement is too arbitrary.  True, if you are presently suffering for them, then undeniably you believe in them right now, but we have no basis to dismiss your supposed belief yesterday when you suffered then, or to presume that tomorrow you will have abandonned these beliefs and won't suffer them then - you may or may not, and you may still hold the values you suffered for in the past or you may not.  It is improper to make such judgments with only this information.|`|JIwKRZADaa	Ive always wondered why a person who quotes themselves sounds arrogant|`|eb38abe11698b46fde324034db87a709aa	Yes, somewhere between fanaticism of past grievances and dread for a possible future is immediate action, but if not for competence.|`|xRbL1xJ7aa	True values are something you're raised with and become a part of you. I don't think one suffers for the true values they have wihin them.    I think as we strive through life to attain our goals and dreams, we don't really suffer either. We may give up some things for awhile to attain our goals and dreams, so if giving something up for awhile is suffering for the end goal, then yes it can become suffering.     The example I'll give you is my situation. I went to school to be a nurse. I gave up most aspects of having a personal life, because to make it in nursing takes discipline, constantly reading hundreds and hundreds of pages of information, diligently studying and to succeed you have to make this period your life, knowing it won't always be this way. Once I became a nurse, I had many opportunities and was able to save enough money money to buy a house which was my ultimate goal. Now, even though the medical field says there is a shortage of nurse's, the truth is there is a shortage of money, funding for hospitals. Hospitals are laying off nurse's and using registry because in the long run it's cheaper. I've lost my job, was and have not been able to find another one that was paying me what I was making and consequently had to give up my house. So, it is now that I am suffering a great deal of heart ache, broken dreams and my once excellent credit. If I were in my 20's, or 30's I could look ahead, but I was getting to the point of thinking about retirement. That all went down the drain last September when the market crashed and I lost a lot of my retirement money.    I never thought at the age of 56, after have been comfortably settled into a life I was enjoying, that I'd have to start from scratch. So my situation doesn't really fit the way you phrased your question. In all honesty, I really did little suffering when I was younger. It is now that I have to put my life back together again.    I'm not looking for pity, or for anyone to feel sorry for me. Many Americans are in the same boat, but my suffering has come at a much later stage in my life, than I ever thought it would.|`|e4tvh1d2aa	true values are not what is suffered for  but you are willing to suffer for.    if it is a true value that is truly held by you  then the consequences should be held with honor  and not considered suffering  i think you need to have a long look at what you truly value

Around here though, I think it's not a sport.

Then during football season, each week was spent learning the new music and formations for each game.

4f6e1488eea68ccac928d6e0d6f6e5caaa	Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Ottoman Empire, and France were the most responsible.    Germany gave Austria-Hungary a blank Cheque  (military approval) to escalate their conflict with Serbia.  Austria-Hungary demanded unreasonable concessions from Serbia.  Russia gave Serbia military backing to stand up to Austria-Hungary.  Russia began a full military mobilization first.  Germany violated Neutral Belgium.  France was eager to get back at Germany after the Franco-Prussian War.      War Escalated because Germany decided to knock out France first according to the Schliffen plan which dictated that France was the bigger military threat.  The goal was to knock out France in a quick action of 6 weeks and than shift its forces to the Eastern Front to beat Russia.  Germany knew it could not win in a 2 front war, but it also knew Russia was backwards and could not bring its army up as quickly as France could.    also according to the Schliffen plan, Germany's forces went through belgium to Flank France.  This action violated a neutral treaty it had signed which gave England adequate reason to join the war.  As the war progressed, England's larger navy (thanks to its huge arms race due to its Battle ship program which meant England had the right to build 5 ships for every 1 any nation built;) this meant England effectively shut Germany off from Trade.  In Response, the weaker German navy began unrestricted submarine warfare and eventually attempted to goad mexico into a war against the U.S. which triggered America's involvement.  (Wilson was looking for an exscuse to join the war.

5wvQEohpaa	The same thing happened with me. But then I got better. Here is what I did.     I practiced my splits on the floor until I got them perfect.   Then, I practiced jumping. Just jumping. First I tired to get high.   Then, once I got high enough, I tried to just split my legs, not high. Just until I could get them far enough apart.   Then, I combined jumping high with my legs apart.     Try just kicking you legs out. Sometimes it helps to kick both legs at once, or the front leg then the back leg.      An easier way: Ask 2 strong people to hold you up. Then ask someone to hold your legs so your doing a still leap (split in the air). That is an easy way and it shows you that you can do it.     Just practice! Ask a dance team member to maybe help you.     Hope I helped!    (using your arms can help you glide/ fly and go higher)(remember to point your feet!!)|`|vCJkg1Kyaa	well, it could be the technique your studio uses for leaps.  if your supposed to devlope through, then try flicking from your knees out.   it could also be a control thing,   try control exersizes, or try to get harder controll tricks, like a pitch hold.  also, it could be something much more simple, you could be not plie-ing enough, get some leg strength and bulid on that.  i hope that helps(:|`|pOhnPf2Paa	Try working on just your technique. At first it doesn't matter how high you go. Just work on popping your legs out over and over and over again!  Just like a split. It worked for me, and as you go gradually get higher and higher!|`|reAtqf0Maa	make sure you really push off the ground! also keeping the leg straight with POINTED (people forget to point) toes you can get it up higher. also having straight arms and looking to the side can help. and when u jump think of going up instead of getting to the other side of the room/
9XAf7jxaaa	Great job!  Excellent.  No flaws to be found.  I think it is much improved from your other poem I critiqued.  Great subject matter, intriguing word choice, and overall quite interesting and unique.  I like the way that you can write a good poem and manage to keep the story good at the same time.  Kind of how I used to write.  You have some ability for this, that's for sure.      Some of the things I wrote I thought were pretty decent, but I have come to a point at which I cannot think of two words that rhyme, keep a pentameter, and write something interesting at the same time.  I really don't know what happened.  The closest I can come to something not completely boring is more like a diffuse, intricately-detailed story with the occasional rhyme and somewhat of a rhythm.  Maybe I could build off that, but it's just not clicking anymore.  Use the skill if you have it.  Either my nickname on here is only applicable to personality, or I am on a huge, huge slump.  I've lost my fricking outlet!  LOL.|`|NMesZaQqaa	Wow, I really enjoyed this. I don't know why, but I was expecting something less. Your first line really captured me.

Now I love it.    Part of the reason is that schools really don't know quite how to teach history. I learned history by buying and reading books on historical subjects that interested me.  You study World War II if you want to understand modern Europe or Asia.  And you study specific aspects.    History is exciting if you approach it that way.  When I was in college my history book was best used as a life preserver.  It was so dry in case of a flood I could stand on it and never get my feet wet.    But I have other books--including a 1920 book on the history of Europe--that are as exciting as an action movie.

That said, I personally have a Nikon D40 Digital SLR, which I believe is comparable to the Canon Digital Rebel XTi.  I have been extremely happy with my camera.  I've also shot a few pictures with a friend's Rebel, which I noticed might be just a fraction of a second faster in setting up for the next shot in "auto" mode.  And I've also heard that Canon has better image stabilization.  And I'm not sure if this would matter much, but all of my professional photographer friends seem to prefer Canon over all others.    On the other hand, Nikon tends to be a little less expensive than Canon.  When I compared the package deal I got for my Nikon (including camera body and two lenses), it was around $200 to $300 less than the same/comparable camera/lenses from Canon.    All this said, I think that no matter which camera you end up with, you will be very pleased!|`|C77c0OE2aa	It doesn't matter, and anyone who says it does is really clueless. You will see both brands in all forms of professional capacities.    Many current digital shooters have one or the other simply because they already had a lens collection of that brand from their film cameras.    With digital, one brand is always trying to outdo the other, and one brand may have a slight advantage over the other in some aspect... for a while.... then the competing brand will come out with a new model that puts them in first place... then the other brand comes out with a new camera... and on and on and on. I refuse to be a sucker for that "you gotta have this latest and greatest camera" brainwashing by the manufacturers.     Just buy whichever one appeals to you the most... for whatever reason. Maybe it just fits your hand better, or has a better price, or looks better, or you just like the name better... in the end it makes no difference. Either one will serve you well and for a long time. You don't have to "upgrade" every time a new camera comes out.    Personally, I choose to use my Mamiya medium format film camera whenever I can, and digital just when it is a have to case. When digital is needed, I use a Canon, but only because I had experience with them in past years and liked them. It could have just as easily been a Nikon.    steve|`|HOGBEi66aa	It's all about the glass, and Nikon and Canon offer much to choose from. I Like Nikon lenses, hence Nikon bodies.    The body will be obsolete in about two years. Go for the glass! : ^ )|`|ApXHcYVfaa	canon, because my dad works 4 them!!!!!
HkEAPJ6Waa	Mmm... this one was definitely one from the heart.  How can I honestly critique this?  Okay, I'll honestly give it a 7 because it is so pure, but a little attention to rhythm would do you well.   No poem has to rhyme, but rhythm is important.  You want a poem to flow consistently.  And sometimes keeping your descriptions basic is better than such ones as "hair of fairest brown"... unless you keep that tone from beginning to end (You'r smile is as the golden sunrise... Your eyes deep pools of vibrant emerald... etc.).  But hey, if that's you just stick to it and forget everyone else.  Write first for yourself, I say.  Unless you wanna be famous or something, just write what sounds right to you and have fun.  Good luck!|`|WbRuTjmFaa	This is written with artistic license and a sense of freedom.  It need not rhyme, It need not have even lines. It is free..  Because it is free it is good.  keep this .... make a copy and use the copy to edit out extra words.  tighten it up and then compare them ... That is the way you experiment and grow.   I am not a critic..|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Yes!haha, you emailed me this poem. I've become a big fan of your work!lol. Good job! I love how you describe things.|`|27722e46d7e1a47f6c3e2edef016aa14aa	6-  Needs a bit of rhymeing.|`|k5OQQt2vaa	Hmm... I feel biased because I think almost every love poem ever written is cliche and corny, but I really don`t like it.   5, because I`m trying to look past my biased-ness(?)    Oh, by the way-- your stanzas should each have the same number of lines.|`|KOxWQtotaa	That's really good :) 8!!|`|PZJdWBQiaa	no,it's to big.
S9bEtVCSaa	It's very nice. I think I now understand the distinction between prose and just an expository paragraph - It can be broken up and made into a poem if you wanted. That's where I was having trouble. Nice write.|`|paOPuM4Paa	I think its really cute :)|`|P0wMTzDFaa	I really enjoyed reading that.  It was so cute!(:    
e30a9e9e5716e986b609ef9728d116ccaa	i guess we do;)|`|y9ltHzilaa	I can see where that would be gratifying but when your stories get to be as long as mine have become, it goes from being thrilling to rather tiresome, especially when you're trying to find a certain passage in all of that writing. I get sick of scrolling and scrolling sometimes when there's something I realize I need to work on in an earlier chapter, because it takes awhile to get to the right spot!|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	No, I have a page counter on my word processor and I feel good whenever I see that I've written more pages, or sometimes when my story loads and the little scroll bar thing gets smaller and smaller, that's cool too.|`|H2cMlG9Kaa	OMG yes! i do that every time. it makes me even happier now since it really does take forever to get all the way to the top! i also enjoy checking print preview just to see all the pages i have! :D|`|klPvo7iwaa	yeah!
JnSrN3guaa	nah, jane's supposed to be young and blonde. emily was supposed to be bella, but kristen is totally way better-er!! [: dakota's a pretty good decision. iwouldn't be so mad if she took the part. (:    :D|`|hDz2Qe7xaa	It's Dakota Fanning, I heard on entertainment news.  I don't really think that Emily has quite the right look for that role...|`|TPBDESp5aa	NO, I think that she would have been an excellent bella though|`|bMYv0fBHaa	Maybe, though I heard a rumor that they were considering Dakota Fanning.|`|f6NcTZyBaa	I  agree with the first person.No, not for Jane but definitely for Bella.I don't really like Kirsten.I don't know why but something just doesn't sit right with me.I donknow.....lmao|`|KQjBLyU3aa	No, she's way too old.
ZhsPSqW9aa	OMG that was so good!! I think that you should add more to the beginning, like add some memories from when they were younger and explain who Riley is... but other than that I think it's really good !!! When you add more, please e-mail me ! =)|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	Is it just me or is Jason a flaming homosexual?|`|klPvo7iwaa	It's interesting|`|TPn3CEK0aa	I dont like the name Bob... its ohh sooo.... cleshea???  No thats not the word, but for everyone percieved as simple minded, they are usually called BOB...  but its ok  yea|`|B5Fm455paa	NO I WOULDN'T|`|SSmM05guaa	I'm confused at the part when he said "Hey Jenna, did you find my note?"  Isn't that Katie he's talking to?    By the way, it's really good.|`|6WPQxzDTaa	well i think you should add a preface to the climax right now it's like duh duh dun but i would make sure you add a little background about your character. i might read it if it was more threating blackmail|`|qHhn3r4qaa	It's a little cliche.... I don't know. It's a good plotline but the whole thing is kind of... I don't know, overused I guess. The whole, two best friends kiss when it's completly out of the ordinary, someone see's or finds out, and then threatens to tell. I've just seen it used too much. If there's a twist later on then it would work fine. Good luck!|`|qJfKeeslaa	yeah i would read it i think it is interesting but i do agree bob isn't the best name but if you want to use it go for it and if you finnish it can you email me the rest please|`|63MFijvjaa	its pretty good but the whole we were best friends i had never felt anything for him then he kissed me thing is kind of overdone. also, it wouldn't be that bad if someone found out about her and jason. she could just explain to riley and i if he really cared about you he would understand. also, its kind of boring and you could use some better word choice like using more descriptive words  and action verbs like when he says hurry you could say he urged me instead of he said. i think you should continue writing though because it could be a really good story. hope this helped!|`|DF7wGWWKaa	You should make it far more interesting to separate it from all the other teen stories out there. What you have here is a story line so overused, it is probably the staple of teenage fiction. Everyone in your story comes of as simple minded and unoriginal. The "awkward best friend kiss" is one of the most typical strategies used by other teen authors. To me, it seems that the guy did not value their friendship much if he willingly risked it all on one kiss. And he completely ignored it acts playfully with her next week? That isn't believable at all!     Overall, I think it needs something extraordinary to make this story stand out. Work on your dialogue so your characters don't come off as simple minded. And develop your characters' personalities so that they all don't sound a like. There should be distinguishable differences in their actions and thoughts, which you do not have.|`|JjuZvvfeaa	I like it, i would love to hear what happens next!
uq1GXvSdaa	i ll say don't worry be happy|`|XxDQGEalaa	Good and evil are ultimately extreme terms. There is a whole spectrum of behavior in humans. Do you see good and evil in the animal world? Probably not, because they are terms created by humans, for humans.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	The concepts of good and evil are not illusions.  They are different base on individual perspective.    What is good for some may be evil for others.  What is evil for some may be good for others.    For example, cars manufacturers may feel that producing cars help to create jobs and provide cheap transportation for millions of people. Therefore, it is a good deed. However, environmentalist feel that it is evil because the cars produce lots of pollution that damage health in the long term. The roads created to support the cars destroy our forests and create environmental disaster.|`|dCqBiDwQaa	When you question good or evil acts you need to think about who is judging these acts as good or evil. You learn what is good and evil from your parents and peers very early on in life. The reason why we do judge behaviors as good or evil becomes clear when you consider how it fits into the long term survival of human beings. Morality has evolved for the good of the species. A system of murders, rapists, thieves and pedophiles would simply wipe out the human race. So in a sense these concepts are illusions, but they are useful laws to follow and come with real consequences to the individual on earth. I don't believe that we are judged by a higher power.

She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.    City of Dreams (non-vampire related romance) by Stefanie Ellis:    Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old.

JIFi4Cvmaa	The American political system was founded in Philadelphia, but the American nation was built on the vast farmlands that stretch from the Alleghenies to the Rockies. That farmland produced the wealth that funded American industrialization: It permitted the formation of a class of small landholders who, amazingly, could produce more than they could consume. They could sell their excess crops in the east and in Europe and save that money, which eventually became the founding capital of American industry.  But it was not the extraordinary land nor the farmers and ranchers who alone set the process in motion. Rather, it was geography - the extraordinary system of rivers that flowed through the Midwest and allowed them to ship their surplus to the rest of the world. All of the rivers flowed into one - the Mississippi - and the Mississippi flowed to the ports in and around one city: New Orleans. It was in New Orleans that the barges from upstream were unloaded and their cargo's stored, sold and reloaded on ocean-going vessels. Until last Sunday, New Orleans was, in many ways, the pivot of the American economy.  For that reason, the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 was a key moment in American history. Even though the battle occurred after the War of 1812 was over, had the British taken New Orleans, we suspect they wouldn't have given it back. Without New Orleans, the entire Louisiana Purchase would have been valueless to the United States. Or, to state it more precisely, the British would control the region because, at the end of the day, the value of the Purchase was the land and the rivers - which all converged on the Mississippi and the ultimate port of New Orleans. The hero of the battle was Andrew Jackson, and when he became president, his obsession with Texas had much to do with keeping the Mexicans away from New Orleans.   Also in strategic terms, Andrew Jackson had the high ground and heavily fortified, even made a huge moat. So his men and cannon were so high up and he created so many obstacles the British walked across flat land in the open and were blasted. Even when the got to Jackson's positions, the British could not do anything. They were already battered, there general was dead, they had to go through a muddy moat just to get to Jackson's position. Then if that was not enough, try to climb up a hill Laden with booby-traps.|`|VNgDd3ugaa	control of the mississippi river/ cotton trade routes at that time everything moved by barges and ships

k5OQQt2vaa	The first stanza is really good but the rest is just... ehhh. It could use some work. I dont like the second one much at all, and the rest is a bit uninteresting. For the third stanza I`d suggest using better word choice and for the fourth (and last) I think you should make it end stronger, like with a profound metaphor or a line that just blows the reader away.  By the way you spelled "criticisms" wrong (XD).    Edit: I understand; I wasn`t very skilled at it either until last year when I had a teacher that was extremely strict on proper grammar. Yes, you did spell that right, haha.|`|0xHroCHWaa	The first stanza is good.  The second one is a little fuzzy with the last two lines.  "While of those who are hidden,  With fear in their chests."  Doesn't flow well because the thought is unfinished and you start a new stanza after that.  Try "While of those who are hidden,   find fear in their chests." or something like that.    Hope this helps a little.  Still a good poem though. =)|`|EXdFa7fFaa	That was the best poem ever!!!!!!|`|nlbJAtuZaa	that was great!!!

UVuxelVOaa	well im pretty young too, and I've been acting since i was about 7. In my case, an agent approached me, but the first thing you need to do is find an agent. be sure to steer clear of any one that tries to get you to change yourself, like loose or gain weight. Then you need to get some Professional picture taken so that potential hire rs can see you before they addition. they usually want a certain kind of person, like blond hair and blue eyes or straight black hair and brown eyes. You then submit these pictures to your agent and wait. Your agent should put these pictures into circulation so that hire rs can see them. If you get a job and get paid your agent will get ten percent of the earnings. I hope this helps, Good Luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. My agent has told me that brown haired brown eyed hispanic girls around the age of 14 are what people are most looking for right now.|`|T57AqnEOaa	Look for some community theatres in your area.

Rowling spent years planning before she even wrote Sorcerer's Stone<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Both:<br>  -Fantasy<br>  -Point of View: 1st person<br>  -Plot: there is a bad guy after them; very exiting/suspenseful<br>  -directed to teens<br>  -most popular series in the usa<br>  <br>  <br>  I think you could start out with something like: Besides the obvious point that harry potter is a story of wizards, and twilight vampires- there are many similarities and differences between the two novels.<br>  <br>  HARRY POTTER SUMMARY- just so you have a better idea:<br>  It is basically a series about a secret wizard world and a school called Hogwarts for witches and wizards. The books center around a boy named harry potter who became famous before he even knew how to talk. A dark wizard named Voldemort killed Harry's parents when he was three but failed in killing harry, nothing but a toddler with no wizardry powers. Harry becomes famous for defeating Voldemort when no one else was able to. Voldemort disappeared after his fail at killing harry, proclaimed gone forever, defeated. Harry grows up at his nasty non-wizard aunt and uncles place until he is eleven when he is accepted into Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. For six years in school (and the last book out of school) harry learns of himself, the truth behind what happened to his parents and the connections between him and voldemort. With the help of his friends Ron and Hermione Harry learns of the wizarding world and most of all of himself and embarks on a journey that changes his life forever.|`|eYF4QSBqaa	Not to be mean, but you have to read the books to compare and contrast!!!!!!

Honestly, Sorceror's Stone is not that long, it should only take you a week or two to read it.<br>  <br>  Why would you want to write a compare/contrast paper on them anyway?! They have hardly anything in common, accept for being fantasy and young adult. Though, the differences between the two are endless: Harry Potter is better written, has an actual plot line and three dimensional characters. While Twilight is poorly written with a barely there plot line and cookie cutter one dimensional characters. I could really go on and on about how much better Harry Potter is compared to Twilight.|`|S4W7FojCaa	Harry Potter: Perfect writing, unpredictable, interesting and thorough characters.

1404d9070bb3e8dbdfa989926c402b0eaa	"Indian Captive:  The Story of Mary Jemison" by Lois Lenski  http://www.amazon.com/Indian-Captive-Sto...  "During her first two years of captivity (as a replacement for a dead clansman), Molly recalls her parents' last words to her when she and a neighbor boy were given moccasins and roughly marched off (before her entire family was butchered on the trail). Her pa assured her that her golden hair would endear her to the Indians; in fact she was called Corn Tassel. She also kept her ma's words in her heart: to be brave, to be flexible and accept her situation with grace; to practice her English in secret and never forget her name, her family or her Bible teachings.     Molly's loyalties were tested many times over the years, for she hated the thought of becoming an Indian. Yet can a 12-year-old girl (Lenski makes her younger) live long in an emotional vacuum? Respect, gratitude and friendship gradually slip into her heart despite herself. Will she ever relinquish her dream to escape back to white civilization? Set against the backdrop of the French and Indian War in 1758, this story is very readable, although much of the "action" takes place in Molly's mind and heart"|`|Q49d8oD1aa	I think I read that, but I can't remember the name...

BB pencils make lighter shadings and easier to erase without leaving indents in the paper, depending on how hard you press the pencil, easier to grumble as well. I use a HB, cause it's just right for sketching, but if you switch pencils, you can make better effects of shades and tones.

1d52RblOaa	im 16 too and a singer as well, but i have been taking voice lessons for 5 yrs. now so i totally understand what you mean. i would definitely recommend vocal lessons so you can learn to sing properly and not cause any damage to your vocal cords, but if you are not into that i would say to stop singing from your throat. try making the SOUND come from your diaphragm (stomach area). its a weird way to think about it, but your voice is thinning and cracking because it is being pushed from your throat. an easy way to see if you are using your stomach muscles is to place your hand there while singing and feel if it is going inward. im sure you are a good singer, but i would def recommend singing lessons if you're serious. good luck!  hope this helped!  p.s. daily tea with some honey always soothes my throat after singing a lot

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Feisty has the most correct and relevant answer.    There is a GREAT uproar this week because the Roman Church re-admitted a bishop who had for years said the Holocaust didn't occur.    "British Bishop Richard Williamson, was shown in a Swedish state TV interview saying that historical evidence is hugely against 6 million Jews having been deliberately gassed. "    Sadly, MOST of Europe was anti-Semitic prior to World War II (which is WHY Hitler was able to enact the Final Solution), and some who were youths at the time continue to think that way.    The Pope readmitted this bishop (one of 4) to mend ties to a French Catholic diocese:     "The four bishops were excommunicated 20 years ago after they were consecrated by the late ultraconservative Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre without papal consent - a move the Vatican said at the time was an act of schism.     The Vatican said Saturday that Benedict rehabilitated the four as part of his efforts to bring Lefebvre's Society of St. Pius X back into the Vatican's fold"|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Because they were in on it, just like they were in on the murder of 14 million innocent women who merely happened to use herbs and folk remedies to deal with colds and flu in their families, and to control their fertility - apparently this was heresy or witchcraft.|`|376a0b518236d45e27355ee9bd22da43aa	maybe coz the catholic church would rather say it never happened so they don't have to admit it stood by and did nothing not even pleading for one Jewish life|`|w2ijWy9vaa	I think the Jews are hated because, according to Christianity, they are God's chosen people. Jews were tortured and and murdered horrendously. No one can hide the evidence of what happened. I just think people should stop being so ignorant towards other races and just realize that we are all the same. I believe some people want to try to start a conspiracy against the Jews, but honestly, if it didn't work out for Hitler, it definitely won't work now.|`|5esm3e1Baa	In terms of the Holocaust, it was not just Jews who were murdered.    Mental patients, homosexuals, political prisoners and many other 'unwanteds' were also killed in the gas chambers and by other methods.  The numbers of these people killed is reckoned to far outweigh the number of Jews killed, yet no one speak up for these victims.  They aren't even mentioned in the various Jewish museums Holocaust exhibits around the world, nor even in the current Imperial War Museum exhibition.    The Catholic Church aligned itself with the Nazis as this was the predominant religion in Germany at the time.  Muslims also fought for the Nazis, in the Balkan region especially the Serbian Muslims.    So perhaps there is a degree of hatred towards Jews, but only from Nazis, Catholics & Muslims.    As for the Jews, well they are currently embarking on a genocide, aimed at wiping out Palestinians, so it is no wonder they aren't exactly popular.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	Because the Bishop of Rome is a former member of the HJ [Hitler Jugand] Hitler Youth - brainwashed to believe crap.|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) This is just 100% typical of the Catholic Church & the frankly nutty ideas that come out of the Vatican.

Ivan|`|xfqHi1tRaa	The TOP person in the Vatican -- the Pope -- just affirmed TODAY that the Holocaust DID happen, so I'm not sure where you get this from.

Otherwise, most of what you read about the Holocaust on this site (and many others) tends to be full of misinformation (at best) and revisionist crap (at worst).|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Perhaps one day the truth will come out regarding the Vatican's relationship with Nazi Germany and the "assistance" they gave a number of senior Nazi officials wanted for war crimes flee Europe at the end of WWII

On the other hand, he did attack the main sources of public deficits and if he didn't diminish, he didn't raise public servers' wages, so in a way answer C could also be correct.

In China, the most populous nation in the world, the nuclear family is considered the most common family arrangement.[1]    In the more urban parts of India, the second most populous nation, the number of nuclear families is overtaking other forms of family arrangements, although unpopular among Hindu orthodoxy who advocate a form of extended family structure called the joint family.[2] In the United States of America, the third most populous nation, 70% of children live in nuclear family units.[3]    http://www.answers.com/topic/nuclear-fam...

Ahud6tPZaa	Take a monologue from a published play. It always amazes me how many people point others to "pick a favourite movie", as they are generally a bad choice, and the people who recommend such action don't know what they're talking about. I can hear the comebacks now...Well, most movies which people perform monlogues from started life as plays, and progressed to the screen. However, movies today tend to be written specifically as movies, and not initially for the stage.    The best way to prepare a monologue is to know the whole play. The monologue is useless alone. Know your piece by rote, and read the play 3 or 4 times. Unless you do that, you don't know the context of the piece. You don't know what your character should be thinking and feeling during that given moment. In short: you don't know why you're saying what you're saying. And if you don't know that, you'll stick out like a sore thumb, and the audition panel will spot it a mile off.    Also, don't move around. The more you stray from there to yonder, the more you take the focus away from yourself. Your performance will be all over the place. Focus and project to a point just above the audition panel.|`|f1aac05e2cf2f28dae8cc17db6309e92aa	I recently had to perform a monologue for a play.  Don't be nervous.

Once you find monologues to practice with, read over them (outloud). Try practicing in front of a mirror so you can watch your facial expressions and such. (:    basically pretend your an amazing actor who is performing in front a huge audience.  Give yourself a round of applause at the end if you please.

(:|`|F0d1bOxgaa	I did a monologue about the holocaust and I was nervous too. What I did was I practiced the script and all of my emotions. Sometimes I looked in the mirror to see what I looked like and if I was conveying what I wanted.    Practice a lot and don't feel stupid! Act out what you are feeling as you remember the script. Move around and act out what you are feeling too, make the audience feel like they see the actual setting and other people around you.     Memorize! That is probably one of the most important...Don't try to invent new things as you go along but if you forget improvise! If you mess up on the words don't sweat. The audience won't know unless you give them a reason to.    Also, go yo sleep early, have a good breakfast and wear something comfortable but appealing. Don't forget to have fun!    Finally, make a good impression when you meet whoever is "judging" you...Make a good impression on everyone...It's important.

xfqHi1tRaa	A powerful Roman emperor. So powerful, in fact, that's he is one of the most famous emperors. Something to help you -- Caesar was his TITLE, not his name.  This site seems quite accurate:  http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia...|`|T4L5BN98aa	an amazing person! he was know for being emberor of rome and his love affar with cleopatria VII|`|d8770762c5340b581f3d5938efc83f15aa	Julius Caesar was arguably the greatest of the dictators of Rome, ruling from 49 BCE to 44 BCE. During his brief reign Rome was transformed from a Republic into an Empire, and he set the path that Rome was to follow until its decline and eventual collapse.    Julius Caesar was born in 100 BCE to an elite family, and from an early age had the benefit of high education and training. Julius Caesars family traced its lineage back to Aeneas of Troy, and through him to the goddess Venus. The origin of his surname, Caesar, is unknown, with a number of different theories offering explanations. These include the fact that he killed an elephant, that he had a full head of hair, that his eyes were gray, or that he was born by caesarian section, all of which are described by words similar in sound to Caesar.    After a brief stint as a high priest of Jupiter, Julius Caesar joined the military. He quickly made a name for himself as a brave soldier and cunning commander. While serving in the military, one of the historic anecdotes of Julius Caesars life occurred: the story goes that during a trip across the Aegean, Caesar was captured by pirates. While held prisoner, Caesar made a promise to the pirates that if he should make his way free, he would return to crucify them all. The pirates demanded a tribute of twenty talents of gold, which Caesar told them to increase to fifty, so valuable a hostage was he. Upon his eventual release, Caesar did return with an army, captured the pirates, and crucified them, staying true to his word.    When he finally returned to Rome, Julius Caesar was made a tribune, starting his path to political greatness. He soon left the military, and began pursuing his political career with his full energy. Caesar eventually found himself elected Pontifex Maximus, a religious position with great power and authority. He continued to play a skillful game of politics, becoming a praetor and winning the respect of many.    Julius Caesar next turned his sights to become consul of the Roman Republic, and eventually became a consul along with two others, forming the first triumvirate of shared power. When Julius Caesars consul expired, he returned to the military field, leading the conquest of Gaul for which he is notably famous. The Gallic Wars lasted for many years, and during them Julius Caesar proved to all that he was one of the most brilliant military minds of the era. By the end of the Wars perhaps a million enemies of Rome had been killed, and the entire region had been brought under Romes domain.    In 50 BCE Julius Caesar was ordered to return to Rome and surrender his army. Instead, he crossed the Rubicon and incited a civil war. The next year he was appointed dictator of Rome. For the next few years Julius Caesar continued to expand the borders of Rome, assisting Cleopatra in the civil war in Egypt, and invading the Middle East and Africa.    Because of his lenient position towards his enemies, Julius Caesar was relatively well-liked for one in his position. The Senate gave him great honors throughout his reign, but some contingents in the Senate disliked his rule, and began plotting against him. On March 15, the Ides of March in the Roman calendar, in 44 BCE, a group of senators assembled, called Caesar to them, and killed him. Included in the conspirators was Marcus Julius Brutus, a favorite of Caesars, and second in line to his succession. Traditions vary as to how Caesar reacted upon seeing Brutus in the crowd, but all reflect his dismay, as expressed in the now-famous line from Shakespeare.
oa3VMgcWaa	There have been some really good answers but the best way to explain: it's the basic movements  around the stage of characters in a scene.  When you read a play and it says "Bob slowly crosses to Janet, Janet turns away", that's basic blocking, ( a lot of times from the notes of the original production's stage manager, rather than the playwright)  basically preplanned movement to take advantage of mood, lighting, intent and sight lines.  Some directors plan it out pretty completely others let the actors find their own blocking through their characters and it's usually subject to change as the play develops.  I worked with one director who would show us his blocking scheme using star wars action figures.    By the way, theatre maniac gave a great answer, but don't let any of her answer overwhelm you.  Your director will give you a good clue where you need to go; she' finished it up with some shorthand so you can mark it in your script.  I was looking at the script for the play I'm in and my blocking notes say CR-DS-Alma-L-blXstart-turn-biz-startBC.  You'll find abbrevations that mean something for you.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	"Blocking" is planning the actors positions and movements in a play. (Determining where they sit/stand, when they should move, etc.)|`|lsYRmKvZaa	blocking means to rehearse where you're supposed to go in the play.  i'm in a play every year, and i didn't know what it meant either :p  hope it helps! :)|`|dQCZDAqgaa	to plan out everyone's movements on the stage.|`|K69z1nXjaa	move around|`|i93KqZ3Kaa	The term "blocking" in theatre means to plan your stage directions on certain lines or parts of the script. This includes crosses, where you move to a different side of the stage, counter crosses, which is when one actor crosses and you take the place of that actor, hand gestures, or body positions. Body positions could be like sitting in a chair or sofa or any thing like that. Body positions could also be the way you are facing. On stage you could either be facing, full front, 1/4 left, profile left(directly towards the left) 3/4 left, full back, 3/4 right, profile right, or 1/4 right.        Another thing to take into consideration is the stage directions.    Stage directions are always from the actors point of view.   Another thing is that when you hear "up stage" that means farther away from the audience and when you hear "down stage" that means go closer to the audience. This is because stages used to be "raked" which basically means that it was a big ramp that faced down wards towards the audience.    Birds eye view of the stage.    Up right __                    up center    __                       up left      right center       __          center     __                        left center      down right          ___        down center     __                down left        for short cuts you can use:    UR, UC, UL, RC, DC, LC, DR, DC, DL      X- means cross|`|pmLlenAtaa	Ok blocking in a play is the same as popping. Or a change in characters. It is the transition to other stances. (Also if you are in a duo or an humorous interp, it is winning with a team member, who you can't go against because you are from the same team or school.)|`|5oy46Dwuaa	blocjking is like for example your acting and your picking up a box and the other character is standing behind you and tslking, no one can see him because you are BLOCKING him. a|`|7N164OHTaa	OMG!!! Blocking is the worst but a very important part of the show. Blocking is when the directer tells you where to stand and then, from that, ifa musical, it is also helpful in coreography. In my Operetta, Pirates of Penzance( I am Ruth) we are now in the blocking process. My feet kill from standing so long, but It is very important to the show!
AA11692355	i agree with kay, the uglies series is one of the best i've ever read. (:|`|z36j8rmRaa	Here's something a bit out of your usual genre but well worth the time.  Most amazing book I've ever read:    Francine Rivers:  Redeeming Love or A Voice in the Wind    Liz Curtis Higgs:  A Thorn in My Heart    Watch out though, You'll stay up way into the night to finish them.|`|5d7HQm5oaa	Twilight.(:|`|mO1s4pMgaa	Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld  This is an extremely good book. It's hard to explain but it's about the future, after mankind basically destroyed the earth (global warming, destroying forests, polluting the ocean, etc) survivors made a new society where there's no argueing, war, etc. Everyone is considered "ugly" until they turn 16 and have this sugery that makes them "pretty" and they move to this part of town where all they do is have fun and party all day and night. Tally, the main character cant wait to turn pretty. She meets Shay who's a rebal and convinces Tally to leave the city for a night to see what's out in the wilderness. Tally learns all kinds of things about being pretty and the truth is.. it's not really pretty. EXTREMELY good, and the sequals (Pretties, Specials) are even better. It's full of adventures, cool technologies, romance, etc. There's also a fourth book from another perspective and it's set in Japan called Extras, but it's not as good as the others in my opinion.    The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins  This book is also set in the future and is extremely intense like you're actually in the book. It's setting is in Panem, a city that's now in what's left of North America (which has become smaller after global warming and melting of the ice caps). Surrounding Panem are 12 districts where each year, one boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen to be in the Hunger Games where they are put into an arena and battle each other and try to survive until there's only one left and is the winner. There's also romance in it and gets kind of sad. I cried at one point. haha but it's really good. Stephanie Meyers, author of Twilight, even recommended it.    Deadly Little Secrets by Laurie Stolarz  It's the first of it's series and is also really good. It's about a girl named Camelia who lives a normal life - dating, has friends, decent grades. But, one day when she was picking an earing that she dropped crossing the street, a car was coming towards her and it wasn't stopping. Suddenly, a hot guy shoves her out of the way, saving her life. He left without her saying thank you or asking what his name was. Three months later, she's starting her junior year in high school and there's this rumor about a new guy named Ben who supposedly killed his girlfriend. Camelia doesn't believe in rumors and when she sees Ben, it's the guy who saved her life. She tries to talk to him but he ignores her at first, but later Ben begins touching her weirdly but Camilia only gets more drawn to him. She later finds out he's not ordinary. He can know the future or past of a person by touching a person and he senses that Camelia's in great danger. Really intense but good with a twisted love triangle.|`|6hnEhNcQaa	The Count of Monte Cristo|`|AA10699315	Ashes (Book One in the Gray Area Series) by Stefanie Ellis:    Sidney Fox was your average seventeen-year old girl. She looked like everyone else, dressed like everyone else, harbored hopes and dreams...you guessed it, just like everyone else.    After a long and uneventful winter break, Sidney returned to the stale hallways and cranky teachers to find a new addition: a mysterious new student named Cael, he seemed to immediately fall into the role of the most popular person to ever step foot on campus. At first, Sidney was repulsed by the gaggle of girls that hung on his every word, that is, until he explained that he has no control over the attraction others have for him, its just one thing out of many that he is just as confused about as she is. Cael knows what he is, but he has no idea how or why. Their search for answers sends them across the world and forces them to go to extreme measures in order to get those answers.    City of Dreams by Stefanie Ellis:    Skyler Ashford is a confused, over-analyzing twenty-five year old. She escapes a small town and bad relationship, winding up in New York City. She hopes to start over fresh and become someone new. Instead, she stumbles across a man. A man she hasnt seen since high school, a man who always held her heart. However, things have changed for him, hes become a world renowned figure in the world of entertainment. Skyler wonders how much fame has altered the man she once loved, and shes determined to find out.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	My GUESS is that the German's threatened to flood the lowlands.    I'll be back after research    Interestingly, following the Allied Landings, By 31 October 1944, resistance south of the Scheldt had collapsed, and the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division, British 52nd (Lowland) Division and 4th Special Service Brigade all made attacks on Walcheren Island. Strong German defenses made a landing very difficult, and the Allies responded by bombing the dykes of Walcheren at Westkapelle, Vlissingen and Veere to flood the island. Though the Allies had warned residents with pamphlets, 180 inhabitants of Westkappelle died. The coastal guns on Walcheren were silenced in the opening days of November and the Scheldt battle declared over; no German forces remained intact along the 64-mile path to Antwerp.    The Dutch government had not wanted to use the old water line when the Germans had invaded in 1940. It was still possible to create an island out of Holland by destroying dykes and flooding the polders, but this island contained the main cities. The Dutch government had decided then that there were too many people to keep alive to justify the flooding. However, Hitler ordered that Festung Holland be held at any price. The winter of 19441945 was very severe, and this led to hunger journeys and starvation (about 30,000 deaths), exhaustion, cold and disease. This winter is known as the Hongerwinter (hunger winter), or Dutch famine of 1944. The food situation was aggravated by a general railway strike ordered by the Dutch government-in-exile in expectation of a general German collapse near the end of 1944.    I wish I could find more, or had a copy of "The Diary of Anne Frank" handy.
TLzknS0eaa	If you check the HMDS charts theres a lot of benzene,tolene,acetone so its a lacquer and you can't put an acrylic over a lacquer or it will bubble they do make a Clear Fusion .Its high on the 'zene' type of chemicals so it can bond and penetrate the plastic that its meant for.
eVPW1dwOaa	You need to add more water. Oil paints are not the best for marbling, acrylic works better. But yeah, thin it out more.|`|AA11898755	You don't just dump 'em in.... You have to pull a small stick through, like a toothpick or a skewer, through the paint like you're drawing in it to cause the swirls.  And NO!!! you can't use acrylics! They MIX with water. The oils, thinned and swirled with a pick FLOAT and attach to the paper. Acrylic will mix with the water and just make a dye.
nDcSY8UQaa	phosphor bronze has a brighter tone and better sustain, where as silk added to the mix tends to mellow it out and give you a better bottom end, but as strings go it's all a preference thing.
epaT3Jpxaa	I'll concentrate on the portable side of things - as I was looking into this a while ago. Whatever heads you get depends on what you want to do- as the person above says. What opened me up to other brands - other than those you mention was looking at the Innovatronix Explorer models and then working backwards from there with regards to what I need and what it matches up with. The Bowens Travel Pak solution was comparitively much more expensive (though most of the Gemini heads work with these). You can also look at their compatibility list also on their site. Simply put, you can take a *compatible* monohead out into the field like a pack and head system.    Before you go for the D-Lites, go have a look at them in a shop where you can get some hands on time - they are plastic in construction and you'll have to judge for yourself if they will hold up to what you want them for (imagine them holding say a large softbox/octobox). The Bowens are much more robustly built. It looks like you are looking for a solution that is cost effective, so maybe the D-Lites and Innovatronix combination might work for you.    The Americans seem to be loopy for Alien Bees and the Vagabonds, but I discounted them because of the lack of availability over here in Europe. Imagine the hassle of getting new or more modifiers?    In the end I went for some Elinchroms (EL series) and the Innovatrnix comes later when it gets warmer here to go out and shoot.     By the way, if you have any questions mail the techie guys at Innovatronix - they were friendly and quick with their replies to my bonehead questions.    If you like the idea of Elinchroms, go sniff out some FX and BX range heads - since the BXRi's have come out there are a few places doing some good deals on the FX/BX 'to go'  kits around.|`|PWwKcjwFaa	If you're shooting outdoors, I don't think 400 or 500ws will be enough to overpower the sun....unless you shoot close to sunsets and assuming you're not shooting through a softbox or more than one person. Of course, I'm also assuming you'll be shooting at 100 ISO at f/11, and max flash sync shutter speed to kill as much ambient.    I would scout the location first and make sure there's enough sockets for your packs, and run long 50' 14-gauge extension cables. If it was an isolated place, like the beach, I'd probably just rent battery packs, like any of the profoto 7 series.    So I guess I'd pick Elinchrom for now, do what you can and shoot indoors as much as possible, build up some cash reserve and save it for next year's budget for 1000ws packs.

hJP9y6kjaa	The first note that is sharped is F, so if you're looking for a scale that all of these notes fit into, than you're out of luck.<br>  <br>  F C G D A E B is the progression of sharps... but if we look at it the other way and name those notes with flats...<br>  <br>  G# F A# D# -> Ab F Bb Eb<br>  <br>  then we're going somewhere. B, E, and A are all in a row, and the first notes flatted, so they would fit neatly into any key signature that has three or more flats - but not seven, since the F is not flatted.<br>  <br>  That equates to<br>  <br>  3 flats - Eb major, D minor<br>  4 flats - Ab major, G minor<br>  5 flats - Db major, C minor<br>  6 flats - Gb major, F minor<br>  <br>  Probably would fit into some of the harmonic/melodic minors too, but those aren't key signatures. Key signatures are only major or minor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|EnW7LZH6aa	There is no major scale containing F, G#, A#, & D#. <br>  <br>  (The only major scale with the 'F' not sharp is C major)<br>  <br>  The other three notes(G#, A#, & D#) are 'sharp' in the major scales of B, F#, & C# (but the 'F' is also sharp in these keys). Hopes this helps.

Meyer is still "too upset" about the leak to publish it. Even though the leak was her own fault in the first place.. you never give out your unedited manuscript to anyone but your editor, and if you do, you sure as hell don't let it out of your sight.|`|Kbi3Cm41aa	Midnight Sun: Edward's Version of Twilight<br>  August 28, 2008<br>  <br>  As some of you may have heard, my partial draft of Midnight Sun was illegally posted on the Internet and has since been virally distributed without my knowledge or permission or the knowledge or permission of my publisher.<br>  <br>  I have a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of Midnight Sun that left my possession and each was unique. Due to little changes I made to the manuscript at different times, I can tell when each left my possession and to whom it was given. The manuscript that was illegally distributed on the Internet was given to trusted individuals for a good purpose. I have no comment beyond that as I believe that there was no malicious intent with the initial distribution.<br>  <br>  I did not want my readers to experience Midnight Sun before it was completed, edited and published. I think it is important for everybody to understand that what happened was a huge violation of my rights as an author, not to mention me as a human being. As the author of the Twilight Saga, I control the copyright and it is up to the owner of the copyright to decide when the books should be made public; this is the same for musicians and filmmakers. Just because someone buys a book or movie or song, or gets a download off the Internet, doesn't mean that they own the right to reproduce and distribute it. Unfortunately, with the Internet, it is easy for people to obtain and share items that do not legally belong to them. No matter how this is done, it is still dishonest. This has been a very upsetting experience for me, but I hope it will at least leave my fans with a better understanding of copyright and the importance of artistic control.<br>  <br>  So where does this leave Midnight Sun? My first feeling was that there was no way to continue. Writing isn't like math; in math, two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like. With writing, the way you feel changes everything. If I tried to write Midnight Sun now, in my current frame of mind, James would probably win and all the Cullens would die, which wouldn't dovetail too well with the original story. In any case, I feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on Midnight Sun, and so it is on hold indefinitely.<br>  <br>  I'd rather my fans not read this version of Midnight Sun. It was only an incomplete draft; the writing is messy and flawed and full of mistakes. But how do I comment on this violation without driving more people to look for the illegal posting? It has taken me a while to decide how and if I could respond. But to end the confusion, I've decided to make the draft available here (at the end of this post). This way, my readers don't have to feel they have to make a sacrifice to stay honest. I hope this fragment gives you further insight into Edward's head and adds a new dimension to the Twilight story. That's what inspired me to write it in the first place.<br>  <br>  I do want to take a moment and thank the wonderful fans who have been so supportive of me over the past three years. I cannot begin to tell you how much each of you means to me. I only hope this note will stop all the confusion and online speculation so that the Twilight universe can once again become the happy escape it used to be.

It's not so weird... just as strange as an sci-fi like story is.     Idea   2- Your fort is sci-fi mystery thriller fiction isn't it? I'm seeing several similarities relating to genre in all of these. Real place, real people usually equals a good story if you write it well. Did you mean there are a lot of old men in the room or that there's one old man in the room. I wasn't clear on that. Will they have to perform their own deaths? I'm just guessing. It really does sound interesting. It reminds me of that Chuck Palahniuk book Haunted except possibly not as gorey...    Idea  3- Reminds me of The hunger games. Have you read it? Sure it's different because it's in a mall and the teenagers are being killed but it does share a few things in common with the book. My questions about it is Why does the militaristic government pick out the 300 17 year olds? Why 17? Because they're almost adults and they want to weed out the weaklings? Why would they be in a mall? Do the malls in this future time have stores full of survival gear and weaponry? Also aside from anything I expect you to answer Where would they hide anyways... clothing racks, grocery store refrigerators, Behind giant stuffed animals?     Idea   4- Vague but it still sounds like it could be a good story. I'm curious who this drugged guy is as character.     Idea  5- For being only 13 you sure do have creative potential in this area of writing. This is a fairly unique idea. I like it. I just really want to know who tall these people are though maybe that's just me because I like studying people's characters.     You are very good at coming with interesting starter character and story concepts. And really... sci-fi/thriller/mystery is your thing. You go with it. My favorite one of all these was probably the first one but that's mostly because you have a lot more detail in that description that in the others. They're all very creative. Good luck working out the rest of the plots.   Would you mind answering my question? It's about the characters from my story.   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|bnMTCx2Taa	wow 13 very good young man- the last one a little like children of men but interesting.1 is the best.    tc|`|YjCfu0heaa	Idea 1-kind of lame, nothing good to write except the trip to pluto-why are they going to pluto, anyway? I don't think people would read a book about the lives of astronauts.  Idea 2- Just sounds too used. Island, abducted, mad scientist might pop out, and some crazy stuff might happen. Not so good at all.  Idea 3- It sounds like you just changed to settings and the kids-sounds too much like, "Battle Royale". So, nope, no good.  Idea 4- On the best, average. Yeah, just your average book, about a kid with a crazy ability. Not so fresh either.  Idea 5- Sounds 100% like, "Children of Men" it's a film. So, that would be unacceptable.     Your ideas aren't so well thought. It's not because your age-age has nothing to do. You're too early to be trying to come up with a plot. Think of a way to mash all these together-there must be a way.   Most of these ideas are to plain-there is nothing there that would entertain the writer, sorry.     Please take your time, and create a good plot!

Not only does Snape want to take out on Harry what Harry's father did to him, but Harry's father also took the love of his life away from him (as you mentioned about how Snape loved Harry's mother). I was thinking the same thing throughout reading the whole series. I mean, you have the one side of Harry, who is innocent in most ways, but then you have the Snape side who doesn't really know what to do with such a great kid.|`|R0iHHPqEaa	No he only protected him because of lily he hated him because of james|`|KQjBLyU3aa	No, he hated Harry because he reminded him of James.

cJDcoBiyaa	I don't have my book with me, but I had a test over this book, and it's oozing with examples. If you look at the description of the beach, Golding describes it with bright, happy colors.  The forest is filled with eerie shadows, creepers, the Beast (a symbol of FEAR), etc.     The forest is what the savages use to try and kill Ralph. Forest = bad.  The beach is where he went for saftey. Beach = good.    Two completely different feelings for the forest and beach.  Now that I've told you what to look for, it's your turn. Open your book and search for examples of what I'm saying here. You have permission to use my info here.    :)|`|To2ZUsrlaa	Well essentially William Golding uses description to highlight the difference between the beach and the forest.  The forest is almost always presented as a dark and mysterious place. It is represented far more negatively than the beach, as a number of the darkest aspects of the novel occur in the forest, such as the hunts, killings, it is where Simon first sees the 'lord of the flies' and the place which is most feared when the concept of a beast is introduced.  Whereas the beach is often shown as bathed in light, and a place of more hope of rescue.  Hope that is sort of answering your question.|`|WYfeH8nNaa	Why do yuo need to know this?

2IOFXmQ2aa	Peoples from Latin American or South American nations are often mestizos (European + Native Americans/Indian).  Most of the time this cultural and racial mixing happened long ago when the first European nations began exploring the Americas.  Spain and Portugal (once an empire wrought on ships) were the main countries that laid claim to Mexican areas and below it.|`|AA11053540	It is one of those racist things, the same as calling Jews "colored".  Perhaps it stems from so many in the Carribean and Central America being black, but being "Hispanic" or "Latino" does not make one "non-white".  Usually it is considered as a separate category, as in "white, black, Hispanic, or Oriental".
5wg7tKc6aa	Have you ever noticed how our society frowns upon true beauty- art in literature is so helpful, I find, and it just brings life to the book- except now, people confuse its beauty and historical significance with childish works, and not many older readers want to read something that appears childish.    It's ridiculous, maybe someday we'll find ourself advancing into a phase where art is used in books, religiously.|`|vJfcepDOaa	Because they are so darn time-consuming and painstaking to make.     Illuminations were done by monks whose job it was to sit for hours a day at a desk copying out manuscripts by hand and illuminating the pages. Few, if any, people have the time, the inclination or the skill to do that sort of thing these days.|`|8asG4WCwaa	When books were copied by hand, the artwork was just as important as the text in many books.  Part of this was because, yeah, rich people could afford the "extras".     In the time period, less than half (if that many) of the population could read, so in many texts, the artwork was a visual reference to the subject covered in the pages (though, certainly not all - I've seen some odd artwork in which there may be coded messages, something else that was popular then).  Tarrot cards were originally visual chemistry texts, not fortune telling tools - if you were familiar with the symbols on the cards, you could "cook" the recipie the card was for, without needing to know how to read.      With the invention of the printing press and the ability to duplicate many copies in a short period of time, including artwork (which would have to be carved into press plates) was just too epensive.  As more of the population could now read, and the printed books were affordable to the new middle class, artwork was just not that important to readers or printers.    Today, with the technological advances we have in printing, several books now have illuminated type page art in them.  Right now, it's still more of a gimmick in the adult market (fills up page space so that a novelette looks like a full novel on the shelf, or it's aimed at fans of a certain series), but if it proves to be a sucessful "bonus" in some of the markets, we are likely to see more of them.|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	I too would love it if they made books like that nowadays.  But I don't think they do because illuminations are all done handmade, and must be very expensive.  I bet rich people in their stately mansions have some leather bound books in their exquisite libraries, but with this economy, people just can't afford to have any fancy books like that.    (I bet you were reading the Inkheart series, aren't you?)|`|AA11898755	They do, but the process is extremely expensive. Rarely do artists now become monks, so the execution of illustrated manuscripts is usually done by commission by a major church (individual church, not denomination) who will form a fund raising committee or locate a member who underwrite the whole commission and then select an artist to fulfill the commission. The last one I heard of was in the 750,000.00 range for an illustrated copy of the bible. It was being funded by church members  committing money to pay by the verse, page or chapter. The artist hand letters the text as well as painting the illuminations. It is a long, long devotion.
lmVDvmMCaa	Heraldry has many historical origins. In early medieval northern Europe, people often used pictorial housemarks to identify their property because few could read or write. These pre-heraldic designs were adopted by succeeding generations of the same family in a time when surnames were not widely used. The ancient Celtic clans used colors to indicate social and political standing. Early Viking helmets show the use of crests (decorated helmets). Inherited, identifying banners and devices were used in battle by descendants of Charlemagne in the 11th century A.D.    The colorful shields, helms, and crests we are familiar with today had their origins around the mid-12th century in Europe, when heralds traveled from town to town to organize military tournaments. Heralds soon became experts at identifying competitors' shields, crests, and banners and they began recording the designs. They developed a specialized language in which they could concisely and accurately "blazon" or describe arms. Over several hundred years, heraldry gradually developed into a highly sophisticated art.    In the present day, if you live in the UK you should contact the heraldic authority in your country.  If you live elsewhere, you can assume arms without paying the state fee.  The best bet is to contact the local heraldic society for design advice.  In the USA, the American Heraldry Society is a good place to start.|`|AA12343309	Actually there is no such thing as a family crest. A crest is part of a coat of arms. Coats of arms are granted or assumed by an individual man,not his entire family.    You can make you own coat of arms, but if you are an American, I don't know if there is any way you can keep someone from copying and using your arms.  Even though that is considered usurpation of identity, we have no laws regarding heraldry in the U.S.
wk1P29iTaa	Not so much love, possibly compassion, but certainly understanding.     I don't crave romantic love.

w2qV8WEmaa	Things are important when you need it.    For example. When you run out of oxygen, then oxygen become important.    When you are thirsty, water become important.     When nature calls, toilet become important.    Things becomes important and unimportant according to what you need and what you don't need at that moment in time.    Person A is more important than person B if you need person A more than you need person B.

C77c0OE2aa	Combining two or more photos into a single photo is actually very simple. Imagine having actual prints of your photos and say they are 8 inches width x 10 inches height in size. Then imagine laying out a piece of paper large enough to hold each print. If you wanted to place the photos side by side, you would need a sheet of paper that would be twice as wide as your prints, so you would need a sheet 16 inches wide by 10 inches high. If you wanted to place the photos on top of each other, you would need a sheet of paper twice as high as your photos, so that would be a piece of paper 20 inches high and 8 inches wide.    You will do the same thing in the computer. In Photoshop or GIMP http://www.gimp.org you will go to FILE - NEW and enter the dimensions of you new "canvas size". You can either do this in inches or pixels or any other unit of measure. There is a drop down list beside the size boxes where you can select units of measure. Again, you will create a new canvas that is large enough to contain your photos you want to place into it. You will need to know the exact size of your photos. You can go to IMAGE - SIZE and see the dimensions of your photos and then from those numbers you will know how large to make your new canvas.    Be SURE, however, when you are creating your new canvas, that you set the resolution (DPI) to the same number as your original photos, otherwise there will be a huge size difference between your new canvas and the photos you drop into it.    You can also make the new canvas larger than your photos if you want to add borders or a different color background or text or design embellishment. Only your skill and imagination are the limiting factors as to what you can do.    steve

QEexR4gjaa	After about 1770 a number of thinkers and writers began to attack the Enlightenment's faith in reason, progress and moderation. The most famous of these was the Swiss Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He was so suspicious that he came to believe that people around him were plotting against him. In the mid-1750s he broke with them personally and intellectually, living thereafter as a lonely outsider with his uneducated common-law wife. Rousseau was passionately committed to individual freedom. Unlike them however he attacked rationalism and civilization as destroying rather than liberating the individual. Rousseau's ideas influenced the early romantic movement which rebelled against the culture of the Enlightenment in the late 18th century. Rousseau called for a rigid division of gender roles. According to Rousseau women and men were radically different beings. Destined by nature to assume a passive role in sexual relations, women should also be passive in social life. A woman's role was to care for her children at home and to please her husband with good housekeeping. Women's passion for fashion, attending salons and pulling the strings of power was unnatural and had a corrupting effect on both politics and society. Rousseau thus rejected the sophisticated way of life of elite Parisian women. These views had a strong impact on both men and women in the late 18th century, contributing to calls for privileged women to abandon their stylish corsets and to breast-feed their children. Rousseau's contribution to political theory in The Social Contract was significant. His contribution was based on 2 fundamental concepts: the general will and popular sovereignty. According to Rousseau the general will is sacred and absolute, reflecting the common interests of all the people who have displaced the monarch as the holder of sovereign power. The general will is not the will of the majority. At times the general will may be authentic. Rousseau's concepts of the general will appealed to democrats and nationalists after 1789. (Many dictators claimed that they represent the general will). Rousseau was both one of the most influential voices of the Enlightenment and in his rejection of rationalism and social discourse a harbinger of reaction against Enlightenment ideas.|`|PRGNC4Bzaa	social contract that is a book that he wrote|`|Xw2JFBVpaa	he was the guy who invented fluorescent light. made millions, i heard.
bFfWFsFWaa	Lincoln and Washington is an interesting one. Both had to put together a nation....one was president while it was just starting out and another was president as it was falling apart. That is VERY interesting. At first I was going to disagree with that because they really don't have much in common, but looking at where the country is during both of their presidency's...that's not a bad choice.<br>  <br>  For one thing, Washington was around when you had the Federalist VS. Republicans. And then Lincoln was around when the State VS. Federal government argument tore the country apart....which was essentially federalist VS. republicans. Anyways...yeah lol interesting. If you need any help email me!|`|N86vHKxtaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  Comparing very different styles lets you show greater contrast between two different Presidents, ignoring the differences in the world at the times they each served.  Contrasting two very similar Presidents lets you draw on differences in the times they served, the issues they faced and the people they appointed to office.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would compare Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson.  Both were brilliant men and highly educated.  Both changed the course of US history and came from wealthy/ influential families.  They were also both somewhat physically frail.  Then there were the differences....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pXlY8eoNaa	I think you should take two presidents who have something in common, and then compare and contrast the two. I would avoid comparisons between Obama and other presidents, since Obama's term has just begun.<br>  <br>  Here are some suggestions:<br>  <br>  1) Bush and LBJ. (Both involved in long, unpopular wars.)<br>  2) Reagan and FDR. (Each has become the "hero" of conservatives and liberals, respectively.)<br>  3) Two presidents who conducted successful wars while in office (examples include Lincoln, Wilson, and FDR).<br>  4) Two of the following: John Quincy Adams, Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter. (All perceived as one-term failures, but who contributed to public life as ex-presidents.)<br>  5) Lincoln and Truman (two presidents whose personal integrity is a strong part of why they are admired).<br>  6) Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. (Both impeached, though not removed from office. You might also discuss Nixon, who resigned.)<br>  7) You might talk about two presidents who cultivated cowboy images. Notable examples include T. Roosevelt, R. Reagan, and G.W. Bush.<br>  8) Rutherford B. Hayes and George W. Bush. Both came to office controversially, through a months-long battle over votes in Florida. Examine how each handled the controversy and how it impacted their presidencies.<br>  9) FDR's New Deal and LBJ's Great Society.<br>  10) The centrism/triangulation of Eisenhower and Clinton.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	I read an article today on Yahoo (what a coincidence) about how Obama's speech was the like of Roosevelt's during the last depression.

She's an exaggerated caricature of a bubble head.  It's to emphasize how ridiculous societal views about women and marriage were in the period.  It also provides a dramatic contrast with Elizabeth's character, which makes the reader admire and appreciate her more.|`|BGU3VpQFaa	Yes  She totally messed up and nearly destroyed her family, yet she doesn't bat an eye lash.

DIlNnjf8aa	He didn't say it in those words, and he didn't say it when he was president, but he did say essentially the same thing in his Lyceum speech to the Young Men's Lyceum in Springfield on January 27, 1838.    "At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reach us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide."|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Doesn't sound like him.  Let me see what I can find.  Edit:  Apparently he did say it.

yH3m4NI9aa	It's pretty good. The prologue definitely was suspenseful, I'll give you that. :]  Now... it sounds a bit clich already, to tell the truth, but I think you might be able to make it work if you remember to give characters unique... ness... XD sorry, I'm not usually one for critiques.  The writing is nice, with decent flow, but it's a tad cluttered and lacking "voice" as my teacher would put it - is that really how you might talk in real life? Well, OK, I said that wrong, but is it really how you might expect your *prepare for ber corniness* heart to write in real life? All nouns verbs don't require adjectives or adverbs in front of it. The characters... already their personalities aren't very clear, but their history seems to be. OK, never mind. Their personalities are a bit too clear - try to show, not tell. In other words, give clues about their apperance and histories and personalities through dialogue, action, etc. You're doing a fairly good job with development, though. The characters are somewhat believable, but I think the dialogue is a bit out of place... think about the character's personality, history, and origins, and how you've explained it, and then it'll come more naturally.   Well, I'm not sure if anything I said made sense, but I hope it helped. I'm not really an experienced or talented writer, so if you completely ignore everything I just said, it's perfectly OK. Most of all, I hope it didn't seem like I didn't like your story, because I did, and I'm so interested to see what happens next. You are a good writer, and I do have hope in this story. woot.  Let me know how it turns out! (:|`|yj3GT7jOaa	Definitely an emotional and dramatic entrance.|`|ye6IiFr7aa	woah that was really good. watch your spelling an grammer though. but besides that i really want to read the whole book! it sounds really intresting and pulls you in at the first few sentences. i love the point of view! its sooo intresting well please keep writting and posting!|`|AA10015648	The point of view is strange. You're in first-person, but you're writing as if someone is watching your character do everything.     "mud splashed onto my white, expensive dress. I was far from concerned."     If your character was far from concerned, then she wouldn't have stopped the story to describe it.    First-person is all about the thoughts going through the characters head, and you don't get into the first-person groove until after a few paragraphs of awkward description. It'd be like me telling you the story of when my boyfriend and I broke up, and I stopped to tell you about details that I probably wasn't even aware of at the time.     If you're going to "see" your character running, screaming, panting... then you have to see it from her eyes, and from inside her mind. If she doesn't care that people hear or see, then she wouldn't even mention the THOUGHT of not caring. She obviously doesn't care, or she wouldn't have done it, or she would have tried to correct the mistake directly after doing it.    Either get us out of her head and write in 3rd person, observing her - or get inside her head completely and stop describing her as if you were a video camera watching her motions.    Other than that, keep it up. Practice makes perfect.

cxDbdhELaa	It was against the law to harbor Jews in Nazi Germany.|`|AA11635601	I haven't thought this through deeply, but it seems to me that the only time an ilegal act is not hopelessly tainted becaue of being illegal, is if the actor is taking the position that the government is corrupt.  IN fact, the only morally justifiable illegal act may be the overthrow of the government.  Anything less is just an illegal act.  IF someone feels a law is unjust or improper, they can and should bring it up through civic channels to have it changed.  I've had a speed limit changed on a highway near my home - BEFORE getting a speeding ticket - that's the way to go - otherwise if I went the speed I want, it would have been speeding - EVEN THOUGH the posted speed limit was inappropriate for that road.|`|AA11906603	There are plenty of situations like that, when you have to make really hard choices to keep those you care about or want to protect safe and healthy. I ripped down a deer stand that was near our property. It was on a neighboring property and a policeman came and asked me if I did it. I replied that I certainly did it, because the stand was erected within 400 feet of our house, which was illegal. They are not allowed to do it without our permission. So they were also breaking the law. I chose to do it because we had animals and kids running around in the woods. I still feel that what I did was morally justifiable.|`|JIwKRZADaa	I've always found Kant's categorical imperative to be interesting in this matter. The categorical imperative is basically this "An action is moral if everyone can do the action and keep running society stable"    For instance: Stealing is justifiable under the Categorical Imperative.    Why? If everyone in the world stole everything, personal property would be rendered meaningless(note this doesnt destroy society), a form of communism would emerge, but society would still be intact.|`|L0uxPZgKaa	i would have to say killing someone in order to prevent them killing an innocent life.    example: a high man/woman walks down the street and pulls out a gun on an stranger. the stranger is actually a soon-to-be mother and has been studying engineering in order to make a better life for herself. A cop across the street sees the man/woman pull their gun and shoots him.      i am also pro-life when it comes to abortion.     a very extreme example would be: when there is a condition when the mother (or the mother and baby) is going to die unless she has an abortion|`|OUbNSXjJaa	A person is using knife, pin, scissors, and other small weapons on the body of another person, which is illegal but considered morally justified or acceptable.

yZD0f5tzaa	One example of this is when they go after torture and kill a female sow.  The killing of a female sow is only one of the horrors that occur on the island.  The killing could be looked at in several different contexts, but there is one that stands out and that is sexual. There are no females on the island and when they find a female sow, they see a thing to violate.  The boys see a female sow and decide to go after her. Even though Golding is not directly talking about sex, there are sexual overtones throughout it.  The hazy summer day is a kind of erotic stimulant, and the boys are hot and tired. The word hot can be interpreted in several different ways, for example they could be hot due to the weather or it could mean that they are sexually aroused. When they go after the female sow, they are excited by the chase and the fear that she expresses. This is the first sexual overtone in that rapists feel a thrill when they are going after their victims. The boys stab the sow and then go after her. Seeing the tortured sow only excites the boys more and they focus on killing her. The sow finally collapses and the boys jump all over her torturing her and finally killing her. Now, I think there were at least two or three more sexual imagery in the book, but the main one I gave you is the only one I can remember. Hope this helped!|`|xJoMSkI5aa	While there is no downright sex in Lord of the Flies, look at a highly disturbing scene in Chapter Eight when the boys kill a female pig. The sexual violence of the scene  lead many to believe this slaughter is depicted as a rape.    From Shmoop/Sex Rating/Lord of the Flies|`|FYBUbRmTaa	When killing the sow he sticks the killing instrument deeper "into" it....which implies sex. Jack enjoys it....so in the book it is supposed to hold sexual meaning. The sow is in pain of course so it is supposed to resemble rape.     The society created on the island with the boys reflects our on society and violence. Sadly rape is a part of that which is why this scene is included.|`|VQyP1jJoaa	well, when the hunters kill the sow, the female pig, they don't actually have sex with the pig. it's more of the feeling they get when they do it. Jack continually stabs downward. But the most vivid part is when Roger puts his spear into the pig.     He says, "Right up her ***!"     And then everyone else sees what Roger did and laughs about it.     --------------------------------------...    This scene in the book really shows their descent into savagery. It shows how the barriers and rules the boys learned in the real world are starting to come down and how they don't really care anymore.
lSV8D9Rfaa	My guess is holocaust deniers do not listen to fact and reason, which defiantly says something about their intelligence level personally, I look for intelligence in my significant other|`|Xq08aatVaa	Of course, because i am one of them|`|JK1Flkm3aa	Although I initially didn't mean to answer this question, but something in my heart wanted to say something: that love has no boundaries. I know a Jewish girl who fell in love with an Arab guy, an Orthodox Christian who fell in love with an atheist (a God denier that is!), a Marxist who fell in love with a Muslim... These are paradox ideologies that are extreme from one another, that some of them are still at odds today on the public and political arena, but these people found the bridge or the means to coexist; not even that, they fell in love with one another.        I know denying the Holocaust is considered utterly unusual, but also denying the existence of God, or the rights of others in existence is considered a taboo to others, too. Enemies fell in love, we've seen many examples in history or even in myth and legends, but to make the one you love an enemy, that's unusual. If the person has qualities, I mean in everything else beside that fault, I think that's fine. Through time, people who love one another will always make some concessions for their significant other.        You just have to be patient about it, and through time and by some logical persuasiveness (if you still think that issue is a threat to your 'personal' relationship) you maybe able to change their minds. Believe me, countries have denied the Holocaust like Iran, but they still maintain a relationship with the EU and the UK no matter how shallow that may be, as long citizens can still be allowed to go back and forth between them, then it's fine.       The rest is up to you, think first, then give the last judgement to your heart in whatever you decide: what will make me happy?. Good Luck :)     P.S.: The examples I gave in the beginning are true, that's what you get from living on campus with international students all around in the UK, lol ! :^ ) .

You're only cheating yourself by asking, "Is electric guitar or bass easier?" It won't matter. All instruments are hard to learn.    If you REALLY want to get serious, GET LESSONS FROM A GOOD TEACHER. Go down to your local music store that sells guitars and most likely they will have teachers (who are not employees at the store) who give lessons. I found my current guitar teacher at one of my local music stores.    But if you can't afford lessons-it is costly-then check out cyberfret.com.
VMDljEFuaa	First of all, they both need work.  BUT..    Let me tell you what else I see.  I see a fifteen year old young lady who is finding her emotional self.  Finding out what all the 'older ones' are always talking about.  Finding the words to describe the height of emotion and loving she's felt.  Also the words to describe her heartbreak and sorrow at love seemingly lost.      I suspect the other posters are trying to grade your technical work but are ignoring the basic motivation to write poetry in whatever form. The basic motivation for all good poetry, and something that you have understood and dared to show, is the underlying emotion driving the ideas and words you've created.  It may well be that these feelings are not "original" in general, but they are original to the author.  The author has dared to bare her soul and should be given credit for such an honest effort.  The technical aspects of writing will come with more education, awareness, and practice.    If anyone writes, they should always do so the way you have - from the heart.  Good luck.|`|5c9ddecce27b7502b61bd0a44c66c6dbaa	honestly.. not to be mean but.. i bet 5 million other girls have the same poems..|`|k5OQQt2vaa	First of all, whats with the '-' below everything???

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	I would say it was a question of desire. If they had really wanted to establish a permanent settlement, they could have. They colonized Iceland and Greenland after all (and Greenland, even the 10th century, had a harsh climate).<br>  <br>  However, the voyages to Markland and Vinland (North America) came right at the end of the Viking age when the pressure to move outward was waning. The Norse went to Ireland, Iceland, Normandy and Russia in part because they had to go somewhere (there a lot of theories about why, but population pressure in Scandinavia because of the good harvests during the Medieval Warm Period is the most popular). By the 11th century, the pressure had been relieved, so there wasn't an impertive to keep going outward, founding new colonies.<br>  <br>  <br>  To understand what I mean, it might be helpful to compare the abortive Norse settlement attempt with the Spanish Spanish settlement of South and Central America 500 years later.  That was fueled by the internal pressures in Spain following the Reconquista. There were lots of noblemen with third, four and fifth sons with no prospects to take over "the family business" in Iberia. They made excellent settlers. <br>  <br>  Likewise, the religious turmoil of the Reformation, Counter-Reformation and the English Civil War provided the same kind of settlers from England. The Potato Famine would do the same thing from Ireland a couple centuries later, and Pogroms from Russia and Eastern Europe after that. A lot of our ancestors came to the Americas less because "it was there", than because there was good reason to leave Europe. For the Norse in the 11th century, life was pretty good at home.<br>  <br>  So, for the Norse to have established a permanent settlement in North America, they either would have needed to reach it sooner (say in the 9th century) OR the conditions that fueled the Viking era would have had to have lasted longer - which the Europeans of the age, who prayed "Lord, save us from the fury of the Northmen!", were certainly glad it didn't!<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the aboriginals - the Sagas (Eric the Red's Saga, and the The Saga of the Greenlanders) don't exactly describe them as overwhelming in any way. Of course, the Icelandic sagas are known to leave out details when it doesn't suit the story ...<br>  <br>  A bigger issue might have been the actions of Leif Ericson's sister Freydis.  She had half the expedition executed at one point because they didn't agree with her.  Not exactly the kind of company one wants to be keeping.  I can see that event pursuade a lot of the other settlers to call it quits.<br>  <br>  Also, it is true that after the short-lived Vinland settlement was disbanded, Leif never travelled again.  However, that is because he became leader of the Greenland colony upon his father's death and had to focus his energies there.  <br>  <br>  Finally I don't believe that America was completely "lost".  It's a fairly well known (now) trade secret that both Norwegian and Basque fishermen were fishing the Grand Banks (off the coast of Newfoundland) during the intervening centuries, but not telling anywhere *exactly* where there were going.  This was typical of mariners of the era who often kept such "propriety information" (as we would call it today) to themselves.<br>  <br>  Therefore, Columbus "discovering" the "New World" was more of a publicity stunt than an actual discovery.|`|AA10242125	"It was left to Eiriksson's brother, Thorvald to make the next voyage to the new-found territory, for strange as it may seem, Leiv Eiriksson never returned there.

Happens to me all the time.|`|kukhR1Gqaa	Well, the Vikings were going through a transition period during the time they 'discovered' the america's.  Vikings had once been a people who lived in rural homesteads in Norway, Sweden, Iceland, ext. who raided villages along the coast.  However, the Vikings became somewhat civilized and settled down from their violent past.  The more daring Vikings still around went sailing around looking for new places to settle.  But you can't take too many people on a ship and having a large fleet was very pricey and cumbersome.  So the Vikings who did make it all the way to North America (aka Eric the Red) didn't have a large amount of settlers, much like the early English settlers in Roanoke and Jamestown.  <br>  <br>  There is not much historical fact to this, but it is easy to imagine the Vikings pissed off the local Native Americans and were soon obliterated.  The Vikings, having troubles of their own with invaders (irony at its best) and not being the best at keeping historical documentation, decided not to try to recolonize the America's and not write about it.  Most Europeans, even in the times of the Vikings, believed if you traveled far enough west you would soon fall off the edge of the world.  So, logically, not many sailors wanted to look for land out west until Christopher Colombus.|`|7HBKzJSHaa	The vikings had no idea whatsoever where they were, if it was an island or not, much less a whole new continent...<br>  <br>  The echoes of the expedition however may have survived because when Portugal, the european pioneer in open sea exploration, began sailing in the north-atlantic, in the 1420's, they had a close collaboration with the kingdom of Denmark and there were several joint expeditions of portuguese and danish in the north-atlantic, something not quite known.|`|Nuu5zUWuaa	the inbreeding killed them, they produced too many tards|`|SHNYP6Xpaa	Climate Change.<br>  <br>  No really.<br>  <br>  Between 1350 and 1800 there was a dramatic change in the climate of the world. Prior to 1350, Greenland was actually green. England could grow grapes and the world was a lot warmer than before. In 1350, the world started to cool, all by itself. The temperature dropped a few degrees causing the viking colonies to become cut off from the rest of the world as the ice sheets came down.<br>  <br>  By the 1800s the temperature started to normalize again.|`|AA10670901	the vikings were not a large scale colonizer but mostly a couple of ships at any 1 time the size being due to the fact that they went looking for new lands because their previous lands were overpopulated the main reason they did not stay in america was they could not beat the overwhelming numbers of  indians  which they called skralings|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	It must've been them Injuns that run 'em off the land!

AA10242125	John Adams was a very capable and industrious political leader yet many found him to be a very objectionable president.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	As president, Adams resolved to continue Washington's policy of international neutrality. To that end, he negotiated a treaty with France in 1800. But caught in the crossfire between the pro-French Republican Party of Jefferson and the pro-British elements within his own Federalist Party, Adams failed to win reelection. While historians have applauded the pursuit of neutrality that cost Adams his political life, they have criticized his support of the Alien and Sedition Acts, which passed at the height of partisan tension in 1798.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Adams

"They crosses our path daily..." should read "They CROSS out path daily" because the plural is already implied by the word THEY.    "It is A unimaginable feeling" should read "It is AN unimaginable feeling". You never use 'A' before a vowel. You do not have "A elephant" but "AN elephant" or "A umbrella" but "AN umbrella"... see?    "..something no one but *ME* can" should read "No one that * I * can" - terrible grammar    Apart from that, it is a well thought out poem, and has merit. It is kind of egotistical, and arrogant at the end, but true.     regards  Claire|`|gtgJTFOoaa	I think you should use proper english, unless you really want to stick with saying "It easy" and they crosses".     It does not make sense to the reader when you say something is "indescribable", yet the next two words try to describe the something,    I do not understand how each stanza is connected to eachother...they have the same format but I am confused how they relate to form a poem. Perhaps you should give you poem a title that catches the readers attention and says something about your poem.

God in poetry just makes me go "blechh."    stanza two is exceptionally bad;  "something," "they," and "crosses" are all in disagreement with one another. also, "i wish you could" sounds incomplete. maybe add "too" at the end? furthermore that's a little insulting... stanza one talks about "few" and "us" so then the "you" in stanza two addresses everyone. What gives you the right to say i dont know truth?    the "you" in stanza three should be omitted because its the avoidable 2nd person (presumably you meant you yourself, the writer, since you dont actually know that love is a feeling that can fill ME). Perhaps "It is a feeling, unimaginable, pure, and unlimited" would be more appropriate.     I like the last stanza.|`|7tfqMQvTaa	It's good!|`|XUwtAWzkaa	Its very good.

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	First off, do not get Twilight. You'll really regret it. And I say this because, judging by reactions of other fans of the book, she'll either end up ranting about Edward or comparing him to you. Plus it's just not well written.    Since you're asking in the B&A section, I'll recommend some books. I don't know what genres she likes, so this will pretty much be a stab in the dark.

For example, a composition of varying contrasting colors might look broken up, but if the same color was used for detail in another area, the eye would move there. Rhythm in a picture is the flow from one object to the next fluidly. A good rhythm would bring the eye to all of the desired areas in a given picture.

46zxsu1haa	I think it is one of the easier SIs to get in to. They have several levels some with and without pointe, so I don't think you need to be on pointe for the audition if you aren't already on pointe. I did their ballet program once (about 4 or 5 years ago) and was in their highest level, at a time I might have been in a level lower at another intensive. My classes were on pointe, but I had been on pointe for about 3 years then. I don't know if they would start you on pointe if you were not already on pointe. You would have to call and ask them, but I think if you were ready I don't see why they wouldn't.

lmVDvmMCaa	MEANINGS:  The tinctures and symbols on a coat of arms have no universal meaning.  The meanings are what was intended by the designer or original armiger.    SO-CALLED FAMILY CRESTS:  A "crest" is the part of the coat of arms that appears above the helm.  A "family crest" is a bogus term made up by people trying to market surname coats of arms.  It is a scam.      There are no surname coats of arms.  If you coincidentally have the surname of an armiger, it gives you no right to use his arms, just as having the same surname of a home owner gives you no right to take his house. Heraldry is hereditary-based, not surname-based.    How did the myth of surname arms start? A clever marketer took some heraldry books and made a database of many coats of arms. Instead of recording the actual person who bore the arms, he just associated a surname with each one (often the surname of the original armiger). The point of this scam was to increase the number of people who would identify with a particular design, even though by tradition using an unrelated person's arms is theft. This clever scam has made millions for the con artists and made fools of many people.    HOW TO DESIGN A COAT OF ARMS: Designing a coat of arms is hard.  First, you need to figure out what you want to say, e.g., do you want the design to be a pun on your name, tell a story about your ancestor or yourself, allude to an event or belief, or just look nice?  Then you need to make sure it is a simple as possible with high contrast so that it is visible from far away.  Some of the symbolism can be on the shield, and some in the crest above the helm. Remember, tinctures and charges have no fixed meaning, but are given meaning by the armiger.  For example, a bird in one person's arms may allude to the armiger's name, but in another it may symbolize freedom.  Expect to spend months thinking and sketching.  You might want to contact a local heraldry society to find someone to bounce ideas off of.

5jMIHuaDaa	Well I had awful stage fright, then I took a GCSE in Drama and eventually it just went. There are no real techniques, you just need to get used to it. Get used to performing to a group of people you trust, then slowly increase the numbers that you perform to.<br>  <br>  It was always easier for me if I felt secure around the people that I was performing to, but when I was performing I would pretend that I didn't know the people in the audience. By convincing myself that I didn't know those people I could perform without worrying about their opinion on what I was doing and I could do it for myself rather than them.<br>  <br>  Four years later I'm still acting and I haven't had a problem with stage fright for a long time.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry if this isn't a well constructed answer, but hopefully I've got my point across :)|`|JZwklgFSaa	What helped me was the thought of the money that I was<br>  going to collect after the show, I presume you are being <br>  paid, also ask the spot light operater to keep it on you<br>  then you will not see any one, just imagine your self alone<br>  with the band. Make sure the band is good, amplification<br>  and accoustics are good, and of course your singing is good<br>  and the audience don't walk out on you, then my future Star. <br>  you've made it, go out there and break a leg, I hope you know<br>  what that means in theatrical terms. Any way good luck.|`|IEQNX4Hxaa	just remember that everyone knows people make mistakes. if you see someone on stage making a mistake do you really even care? no one is going to remember anyways so dont worry about :D life doesnt last forever so make the most out of it. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|TDLmhGauaa	Have one stiff drink (just the one mind - we don't want to you going onstage bladdered!) focus on the lights and not the audience and just sing and as you perform your confidence, nerves and performance will build up and it will be just like when you are rehearsing ie, not nervous!<br>  <br>  Failing that - visit the toilet before going on stage lest you have an embarrassing accident!|`|caa077683700ae300933b748b130eb78aa	what helps me is don't  THINK it sounds stupid but backstage say you first line in your head quickly all the lines in the scene or a brief ones the ones your not sure of then go on stage and ddon'tlook at the audience look at the wall behind them focus outwards and block your mind and concentrate on your co actors <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or in your case singing go on and sing like you have your eyes closed  deep breath and sing dont look at anyone and only think of the words and reaching them|`|TZm4YqHEaa	Relax as best you can, keep yourself busy before you go on. Take deep breaths, but through the mouth, not the nose. Also when you are performing, pretend that you are the only person in the room and nobody is actually there.|`|x7z0z0kwaa	start acting in front of your family then gradually build the crowd|`|Kfn2XlZAaa	I also love singing and have the same problem, but its only  start thats actually worrying once i get started im absolutly fine. People say to imagine everyone in their underwear, trust me this does not work. I should know try singing too a small group first such as a few people from your family or your friends, then as soon as you feel good and ready just get a bigger audience  until you can perform infront of many people. Maybe try singing at your next family gathering. And your hands, they can be frustrating but don't put them in your pocket it might give the wrong impression, try getting a stone or personal item that you find lucky for you and hold it tight in your hand whilst perfoming, also one last tip dont look at everyone in the audience until you think your ready try focusing on one particular person that you dont mind performing to! Hope i helped!|`|3xHuLeiTaa	Remember,if you're good,people want to see you perform.There's no reason to be nervous.If it helps you initially,close your eyes when you're on stage.Also,instead of looking at the crowd,try looking above their heads,or at the top of their heads.Or focus on something in the room,like the back wall.Just make sure whatever you focus on doesn't make it look like you're looking at something too high or too low.|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	imagine you are someone else, i.e.  a character in a musical, so that it's not you singing it's the character<br>  worked for me|`|xUBmPeObaa	Become a director.

"A killing virus has swept the earth, sparing only children through the age of twelve. There is chaos everywhere, even in formely prosperous mid-America. Gangs and fierce armies of children begin to form almost immediately. It would be the same for the children on Grand Avenue but for Lisa, a yen-year-old girl who becomes their leader. Because of Lisa, they have food, even toys, in abundance. And now they can protect themselves from the fierce gangs that roam the neighborhoods. But for how long?

NYU37jfGaa	The 1920s was an era when expectations of how women should behave changed dramatically.  Women shortened their skirts and bobbed their hair, they took to wearing makeup, drinking, smoking, driving automobiles, and indulging in 'heavy petting' with their boyfriends.  The emphasis was on girls being 'pals' with the men in their lvies, doing everything that th emen did.  Golf, tennis, and swimming were all popular activities, and young women were supposed to share the interests of their men friends.    Interest in careers and social reform declined.  There were fewer women in the workforce in 1930 than there had been in 1910, and the idea of staying single and devoting yourself to a career went out of fashion.  Women professionals werer concentrated almost entirely in four areas - teaching, nursing, social work and libraries.  Dr Liillian Walsh, a longtime practitioner, concluded sadly that women doctors had become as fashionable as "a horse and buggy".     The 'New women' of the pre-WW1 era, who had grown up beleiving that they had a duty to make the world a better place, were dismayed by the frivolity of the new generation.  Jane Addams said girls "astounding emphasis on sex" was disquieting, given the unique social contribution the "uneducated married woman" had made for the last fifty years.  Vida Scudder of Welleslye thought the 1920s were the bleakest years of her professional careeer.  Marjorie Nicholson of Columbia looked out over the sleek heads of her female studetns and decided that her own era had been "the only generation of women which ever found itself."    American woman's most celebrated job was as consumer-in-chief.  "Today;s woman gets what she wants. "enthused an advertisement in the chicago Tribune. "The vote.  Slim sheaths of silk to replace voluminous petticoats.  Glasware in sapphire blue or glowing amber.  The right to a career.  Soap to match her bathroom's colour scheme."    Contrary to what Isis says above, it was not unusual for women to go to college before WW1, in fact women made up a third of all college students in the USA by 1880.|`|x5mDmNlOaa	woman were only allowed to go to school (allowed by the elite{Rockefeller's}) so that they could be brainwashed by the public school system...they could not allow the free thinking brain of a female to ruin their master plan of ruling the world........|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Going off the Great Gatsby, you'd be hard-pressed to see anything about women in the 1920s change, considering how it portrayed the women characters in the novels as needy, whiny, etc.     I guess the best way to help you without pasting a lot of useless stuff here would be to give you this link:  http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=How+...|`|UeRBQBa9aa	During WWI, many women came out of the home to work in positions in which men had dominated . The 'Victorian era' of expectations of women ended quite suddenly. After the men began returning from WWI, they were more or less expected to return to 'the home'.  Many wished to continue working. Suffrage had finally succeeded and  they were now allowed to vote (ca.1920). WWI, the vote, and other social conditions, caused a certain development of self-sufficiency among many women. The book of which you are referring is but one writer's perception of the roll that women played during this time period. Many began to enroll in institutions of higher education and earned degrees in many subjects. Before this period it was considered as 'unusual'. By the 1930s it  was no longer considered 'odd' to be female physician, professor, or even private secretaries. [Most of these positions had been held by men before WWI].  One also has to consider that with working women, there was the necessity of inventing machines to aid in a more modern approach to house work. The refrigerator, radio, vacume cleaner, and a more modern type of sewing machine, the car, and movies [although silent until the the early '30s] were invented, among others.   [this same type of female 'attitude' took place in larger numbers after WWII after 'Rosie the Riveter, and female in the military, among other things].   The 'Roaring Twenties', as they are called, were populated by many women who wished to be educated, work outside the home, live on their own, ['horrors'], (and this certainly didn't make them all unfaithful to husbands, become alcoholics, or practice any other immoral events in great numbers, [the 'Flapper era' lasted a short period, and wasn't the 'all conclusive' attitude of all females], although some males may have had 'bruised egos'.....life goes on fellas.  isis1037@yahoo.com

6SwaWSoyaa	What instrument do want to play, because if you have the determination you can do it. Go to your local music store and ask about purchasing an instrument and they may even give you information about getting music lessons. You should join the school band because that will help you immensely. You will have to practice, ge books, and if you still want to by the time you are in college sign up for a music class for beginners, intermediate or advanced. I reccomend that you get the books 1 and 2 by Hal Leonard called "Essential Elements 2000" you can get this over the internet. You can watch youtube videos of your instrument, etc. Can you post what instrument you want to play though?    add:  By the way I don't know if they were in your interests or not, but I do not recommend the oboe or french horn, because they are the more difficult instruments to play. However, if you wanted to play them and you have the ambition....go for it.|`|Ro666eg7aa	Its called 'teaching yourself'.  That's what a lot of us do!  Go to a store.. pick up your favorite instrument..  DO NT JUST WALK IN THE STORE AND BE LIKE  I WANT THE GUITAR CUX SLASH PLAYS THE GUITAR  OR I WANT THE PIANO BECAUSE BEETHOVEN PLAYED THE PIANO.. NO...pick up an instrument that looks .. cool. try it.. if you really like it! then take it.   Then go home.. go on google.. ( lets say you have a guitar).. then type in.. guitar lessons for free.. or somtun.. then once.. you've mastered the basics.. start buying books.. because the more complicated stuff should be learned from books because books are more reliable then websites!|`|uiYs7TPjaa	you can... search for people online for private lessons i started playing the viola in the 6th grade,but i joined in school....|`|hs3wzCz7aa	If you already own or have access to an instrument, that would be a great start. Is there a particular instrument that appeals to you? There are many ways to get started. The best thing is, to grab an instrument and mess about with it. Ask people who play that instrument for pointers. Watch bands when they play live and look closely at what they're doing. Pick up any beginners books you can find. There are also great resources online. The most important part is to sit down and try to play the instrument. Don't think of it as practicing, think of it as playing and have fun with it.|`|AA11003274	You can take private lessons.  There are probably lots of people in your area who would give private lessons, and in this economy, you could probably find a pretty good rate.  Look in your local newspaper, flyers posted in grocery stores, search online, ask around at school for a referral, etc.  I think you will be surprised what you will find.

JIFi4Cvmaa	To put it bluntly, the USA was ticked off. Under  Tzu Hsi (empress of China) under the  Qing dynasty. She and the Chinese wanted western influence out, all of it. The make China into the great Imperial empire it had been thousands of years ago. So they took on all western influence in China. They took on the USA, Britain, Italy, Russia, Germany, Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Boxer Rebellion, an anti foreign uprising in China by members of a secret society beginning in June 1900. The society, originally called the Boxers United in Righteousness, drew their name from their martial rites. Over the course of the uprising, a force of some 140,000 Boxers killed thousands of Chinese Christians and a total of 231 foreigners, including Germany's ambassador. On 17 June 1900, the Boxers began a siege of the legations in Peking. The United States joined Great Britain, Russia, Germany, France, and Japan in a military expedition for the relief of the legations, sending 5,000 troops for this purpose. The international relief expedition marched from Taku to Tientsin and thence to Peking, raising the siege on 14 August. Believing that an intact China would further U.S. trade interests in Asia, Secretary of State John Hay chose the opportunity to reiterate the "Open Door" policy of the United States and issued a circular note identifying the U.S. goal to "preserve Chinese territorial and administrative entity." In addition, the United States did not join a punitive expedition under German Commander in Chief Count von Waldersee, and, during the Peking Congress (5 February7 September 1901), the United States opposed the demand for a punitive indemnity, which might have led to the dismemberment of China. The Boxer protocol finally fixed the indemnity at $333 million, provided for the punishment of guilty Chinese officials, and permitted the major nations to maintain legation guards at Peking and between the capital and the sea. The U.S. share of the indemnity, originally set at $24.5 million but reduced to $12 million, was paid by 1924. They killed innocent people and destroyed property to rid China of its western presence.

"The volatile world of male adolescence provides the backdrop for John Knowles' engrossing tale of love, hate, war, and peace. Sharing a room at Devon, an exclusive New England prep school, in the summer prior to World War II, Gene and Phineas form a complex bond of friendship that draws out both the best and worst characteristics of each boy and leads ultimately to violence, a confession, and the betrayal of trust. Narrator Scott Snively's ability to switch seamlessly from the perspective of a teenager tormented by feelings he doesn't want to understand to the reflective musing of a man looking back at the formative experience of his youth provide both the story and the setting with an immediacy that quickly engages listeners. Not only does Snively give a distinctive voice to each of the main characters, "|`|OUmOyjNtaa	That sounds like A Separate Peace by John Knowles. Only the main character, Gene, lives.

I know she sounds too severe.... just remember when people get older  they get set in their old ways and cannot really understand that even  when things seem a little different your still doing the right thing.    One way to fix things with her suspicion and all that is turn it back on  them.....Make sure you are always happy and laughing and make a  game or joke of what she is saying, like when she accuses ...Go over  and totally take her by surprise by giving her a big HUG and Kisses  and tell her you love her ..... before she can set the pattern to how she  starts nagging.....make her laugh and everyday tell yourself you will  do something to make her happy.....pretty soon if you keep this up  you will see the difference in her.    Remember you have to give it a while, you can't expect to change  instantly behaviour she has been used to acting out a certain way..  So make sure  you keep on top of it and don't give her a chance to do that,  so good  luck and enjoy the difference.|`|HbayB338aa	I don't think u hate her ur just mad.... my dad is the same why but i still love him because hes my dad & my blood|`|tHq4HobBaa	don't hate her but give her a right tit for tat.  thus she can understand a preteen is growing up and she is now becoming an adult and she has her own workprocess,  her own wish.  i'm talking about you.
To2ZUsrlaa	Well i suppose Iago is a somewhat pathological liar, deceiving both Othello and Michael Cassio throughout the play, although most of the lies he tells are said in order to help him toy with Othello he regularly lies seemingly for the sake of it. He is a sadistic character, constantly attempting to hurt his fellow characters both psychologically and physically for example he wants to ruin Othello's relationship with desdemona and he is essentially a murderer.  Hope that helps

5llBXFF4aa	As already suggested, "best" is an opinion - but one I happen to agree with.  The answer is not simple, though.  The short version is that Lincoln took over the Presidency at a time when a large minority of traitors was reaching the culmination of over 4 years of plotting the overthrow of the state governents and Federal government.  He faced dissention in the North, rebellion in the South, and for over four years worked magic that I don't think any other person on Earth could have done.  He held the Union of the North together, and made the right decisions which prevented the country from being split in two.      To suggest - as someone did - that Lincoln was responsible for the deaths in the Civil War shows absolutely no knowledge of the events.  The slave powers were going to rebel - which they had no legal or moral right to do - and it was the good fortune of the country that Lincoln happened to be the man forced to lead the country through it.|`|4sXYcMIBaa	i think he was the best because he was a moderate, he didnt agree  with slvery and he didnt try to stop it like how u learn in elemenatry school, but he did try and keep the u.s together. However in this plan he did produce the emancipation proclamtiation releasing slaves, bt in the end he was really do what was best for all of america not just for the north but for the south as well    abraham lincoln wasnt the reason for all the deaths of the people in the civil war.. i took ap unites states history jefferson davis was the reason for it all|`|ac815d08d535e731adb9a4dce003e9eeaa	He wasn't the best president, he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.    The best president was William Henry Harrison. Just 30 days after his inauguration, he dropped dead. If more politicians would have followed Harrison's fine example, this would be a better country and a better world.|`|AA10015648	That's not a quantifiable statement. "Best" is completely opinionated.    But, you could argue that he helped prevent the US from being split in two during the civil war.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	Guess because he was the first president to do something for civil rights|`|bPd7llYuaa	preserved the union, freed blacks from slavery, died for his risky decisions|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Lincoln was a mentally-disturbed, egomaniac tyrant that is soley responsible for the Civil War and the deaths of a million Americans.     The man was an undeniable White Supremists and racist. Need evidence?     "I have no disposition to introduce political and social equality between the white and black races. There is a physical difference between the two, which in my judgment will probably forever forbid their living together on terms of respect, social and political equality, and inasmuch as it becomes a necessity that there should be a superiority somewhere, I, as well as Judge Douglas, am in favor of the race to which I belong having the superior position;" Lincoln-Douglas Debate 1858    "I will say then, that I am not nor have ever been in favor of bringing about in any way, the social and political equality of the white and black races, that I am not, nor have I ever been in favor of making voters of the negroes, or jurors, or qualifying them to hold office, or having them to marry with white people...there must be the position of superior and inferior, that I as much as any other man am in favor of the superior position being assigned to the white man." Lincoln, 1858, Repeated later to a press question|`|vf8cEsYQaa	he freed the slaves|`|mLAi6qdFaa	he wasn't the best, that is opinionated, but he was one of the greatest, he kept our country together and abolished slavery, which is a lot to handle|`|vExQCsNYaa	Best is based on your opinion, but here are my reasons:    -He made some major contributions to the abolishment of slavery. He didn't originally plan to do it, but it was a major step in our country nonetheless.    -He united the country and kept the south from breaking away.    -(This is probably the biggest one.) He cared about the country as a whole a lot more than his own gains. Many politicians try to do whatever they can to help their careers and their friends rather that make a real difference. Lincoln was probably one of the most hated presidents ever. The south hated him for preventing them from separating and the north hated him for forcing them into a war they didn't care about. But he stuck to his guns and now the country is much better off for it.

iEfz0H62aa	the mac scene that has blood in it is Act 2 scene2   Lady M. Who was it that thus cried? Why,  worthy thane,  You do unbend your noble strength to think   So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,   And wash this filthy witness from your hand.   Why did you bring these daggers from the  place?  They must lie there: go carry them, and smear   The sleepy grooms with blood.   Macb. I'll go no more:  I am afraid to think what I have done;   Look on't again I dare not.  Lady M. Infirm of purpose!   Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the  dead  Are but as pictures; 'tis the eye of childhood   That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,   I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;  For it must seem their guilt.  [Exit. Knocking within.   Macb. Whence is that knocking?   How is't with me, when every noise appals me?   What hands are here! Ha! they pluck out mine  eyes.   Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood   Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will  rather  The multitudinous seas incarnardine,   Making the green one red.     Re-enter LADY MACBETH.   Lady M. My hands are of your colour, but I   shame  To wear a heart so white.[Knocking within.]  I hear a knocking   At the south entry; retire we to our chamber;  A little water clears us of this deed;   How easy is it, then! Your constancy  Hath left you unattended. [Knocking within.]  Hark! more knocking.   Get on your night-gown, lest occasion call us,   And show us to be watchers. Be not lost   So poorly in your thoughts.   Macb. To know my deed 'twere best not know  myself. [Knocking within.   Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou  couldst!  Julius Ceasar is Act3 Scene1  Bru. Grant that, and then is death a benefit:  So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridg'd   His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans,  stoop,  And let us bathe our hands in C?sar's blood   Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:  Then walk we forth, even to the market-place;  And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,   Let's all cry, 'Peace, freedom, and liberty!'  Cas. Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages I  hence  Shall this our lofty scene be acted o'er,   In states unborn and accents yet unknown!  Bru. How many times shall C?sar bleed in  sport,  That now on Pompey's basis lies along   No worthier than the dust!  Cas. So oft as that shall be,   So often shall the knot of us be call'd   The men that gave their country liberty.  Dec. What! shall we forth?  Cas. Ay, every man away:  Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels   With the most boldest and best hearts of   Rome.   In Hamlet there is no direct reference to blood but it usually shows up on stage during Act5 Scene2 during the sword fight between hamlet and Laertes  Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by  awhile.   Come[They play.] Another hit; what say  you?  Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confess.   King. Our son shall win.   Queen.

Ger|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Macbeth:    Blood shows up a lot in this play. Blood as a result of actual wounds is almost omnipresent, from the bleeding sergeant in the beginning to Macbeths bleeding head at the end. But its the imagined blood that arguably has the biggest impact as a symbol. When Macbeth considers murdering Duncan, the dagger he sees is covered in Duncans blood, representing the change between a murky thought and a done deed. Seeing it so done, Macbeth can shore up the courage to go through with murdering the man. In his minds eye, its already happened. Banquos ghost at the banquet has the peculiar quality of still bleeding from his dead wounds, which weirds out Macbeth, understandably.    Other links from Shmoop for Caesar and Hamlet below|`|To2ZUsrlaa	Sorry i don't have any sources but a google search will bring the correct quotes i'm referring to.  In macbeth, Lady macbeth goes mad as a result of guilt, she spends one scene attempting to scrub what she believes is the blood on her hands off. Its a good scene to use because its more metaphorical so it should broaden your work, so that there is both physical blood and the theme of blood as a mark of guilt.
KwipSpZbaa	Think you're chopping the lines short a litle bit...     Just because you have read poems, or seen poems that have short choppy lines.. doesnt mean you should do it randomly. There is a reason for this. Poets agonise over words and line breaks for hours, days years sometimes!     maybe     I wish I could be someone else  just for a day    would be more powerful than disjointing the harmony and thought process...    Think about it. When you read this, there is no meaning in "I wish I could." just on its own.     But "I wish I could be someone else" - just reading that sentence - implies something and then is clarified by the following sentence "just for a day" which implies you just want to try it out.     lets think a little more.. do you really just want to try it for a day, or is it a longer period. Your poem gains 'hatred' of your situation as it goes along, and it would seem that in reality the 'voice' of the poem would rather change their situation completely... rather than just for a day... so maybe you could end it that way... like     Maybe a day is limiting  in this life anyway    or something similar...    To me this poem read like someone who just starts out writing how they think a poem should be and then gets into the flow of things and actually gains some momentum and starts making interesting remarks about their life...     DONT shy away from that. Pursue it. Don't just write some junk because you think thats how it it supposed to be. You poem develops over time.     Re-read  "I wish i didnt have  a science teacher  that hates me"    Then think about the opening line:    "i wish i could  be someone else  just for a day"    If the 'voice' is hated... then maybe elaborate abotu floating away to that different life forever...    This is why we write poetry... to gain freedom, express desires - whether attainable or not. It breaks our world up and releases us from things that are hard or different even.     hope this helps.  I think you could have somethign with this poem... but dont go overboard on tryign to be "free" with it your style. There are reasons why poets do this and if you dont know why then look into it. Its all about adding meaning and emphasis... do make sure a line break does it for you.     peace  Claire|`|poC9j0Diaa	That is really good.

Modeling is not a job or anything you should be really proud of.  Nor does it take any talent.  It just involves standing in front of a camera while afterwards someone completely edits your entire body or face and makes you look the way no one else does, for the most part.  What they look for is people who can be easily manipulated on the computer.    Next time you look in a magazine, just bear in mind that these models, as they call them, aren't really in shape. Nor do they necessarily look good. The computer does the exercise for them.  Amazing what they can do today.  It's the same in movies, TV, internet, everywhere you look.

But I really don't mind answering people's questions, I've never found it annoying.    megan    EDIT:  this is to pirate-vampire:  unfortunately, this is a more recent update:  http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsu...

MoidAgwuaa	Beautiful question, sir. And Mad World would be amazing.    I think he'd probably be into Simon and Garfunkel. Sound of Silence or The Only Living Boy In New York.    He'd really like the song Chutes Too Narrow by the Shins, the cover of Superstar that was on the Juno soundtrack, and probably adore My Bloody Valentine. He'd probably be into the Cure on some days, too.|`|chlGzFQlaa	Jesus, have you people not read the novel at all? He is subversively depressed and yet you people go out and reccomend depressing emo music.    I guess he would listen to a whole lot of indie music like Death Cab, The Shins, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, The Smiths, and yeah Simon and Garfunkel.|`|16f56c46047f5f5b2957d5079fa23edeaa	I KNOW WHAT HOLDEN WOULD LISTEN TO BETTER THAN ANY OF YOU.  Why? Because I was once obsessed with Mr. Salinger, and so far none of you have seemed very adept in answering this question.  First off, he would never listen to anything contemporary.  Secondly, if I had to go off of only the book, I would surmise that Holden would be listening to "Little Shirley  Beans", the record he buys (and accidentally breaks) for his sister.  If I had to guess again what he'd be listening to, I would guess he would listen to some weird vaudville recordings from the 30s---something so esoteric that NO ONE else his age (or most anyone) would have ever even heard of.  Deep down, Holden  (and Salinger) liked to think he was smarter than everyone else out there.|`|UnlaK5WOaa	He wouldn't be listening to totally emo crap because he hates being around things that make him sad.    He really does like jazz in the book.  I like jazz too.    Since he seems to enjoy jitterbug, fast paced music, stuff he can dance to, he would really like classic rock sounding stuff.  He would enjoy, The Who, The Beatles (who doesn't love this band?) or The Strokes.  JUST NOTHING DEPRESSING OR GRUNGE.    He might even like old school hip hop.  That's stuff you can really break down to unlike most crappy rap today.    He would hate pop because it's phony, grunge, emo, punk, and heavy metal because all of these would depress him.|`|pVTevFJgaa	I think that he would indeed be into grunge.  And also maybe Metal?     But I bet he would HATE pop... especially for the cheesy phony lyrics in most of the songs...
c92d48030d0612c8b4dec267d2dd1d86aa	This is pretty good.  I like how you begin, but you begin in the third person, talking about rain.  You then switch to a first person perspective.  I'd rather see it remain consistent.  Rain is probably a metaphor for life in this poem, but I think it's a bit harsh to say it's a curse and a miracle.  I've never thought of it as either.  If you're going to make the case for this, you're going to have to include more imagery.

The slightest thing, such as the shape of the moon, or the the number of lights on in the building across from mine at night can send my imagination running wild, and it usually translates into writing, or into me playing action figures, using television remotes and pens as my action figures.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Well for me it doesn't take much to get my imagination flowing. I could be watching two people on the street talking and create an entire screenplay out of their interaction.

AA11578107	I couldn't agree more!    I think the reason this happens is we become jaded by life, we know what's coming around the corner, we've already experienced it once or twice and it is therefore no longer appealing.   Try spicing up your life with spontaneity.  Do something completely random.  Go to a different Starbucks.  Try Starbucks.  Talk to strangers ( in a safe environment of course )  Make new experiences for yourself and maybe then life will regain it's spark.|`|7IHV3jUhaa	Well it depends who you're asking and how you're life is.  Take risks. Be optimistic. Be kind to people.|`|AA11389246	If it was a bowl of Cherries they wouldn't call it life.|`|1mpnSoFtaa	Love, marriage, kids, and buying a house IS unpredictable.  As we get older, we resume more responsibilities. We also have seen alot of what we've seen as a child, such as Christmas, so it gets kind of old. You say "When I was younger, going to college seemed like an adventure, like the time of my life." I'm a freshman, and to me it still sounds like a fun adventure. I want to go to London. We'd love to be able to do more things, something new, childish, and exciting. But since we'll soon enter the world of adulthood and responsibility, we are expected to act that way. We are supposed to enjoy watching instead of doing, stay quiet instead of L.-ingO.L., and keep track of time instead of losing ourselfs in it and learning from our mistakes. That's another-being expected to alredy have learned from your own mistakes and others. That's why we should live like there's no tomorrow, smile like we're happy, laugh until we cry, and dance like nobody's watching.  HAPPY 2009!! Have fun in college!|`|IzhKZfsMaa	The cost to participate in something exciting keeps increasing until finally we can no longer afford to pay for something which would excite us.|`|oa3VMgcWaa	I know there are answers above mine that might tell you differently but I say...    Not at all, I'm almost 50 and I still find things to be excited about.  The difference is the things that you describe were once new and as you grow older there are fewer things that you haven't experienced for the first time.  For me, some of the exciting things have been the birth of  children, trying new things and challenging myself to become better and learning new things, birth of a grandchild so on and so forth. Plus the excitement of grandchildren about Christmas is contagious.    (Not to be a downer) but my wife passed away in May, although I still miss her (a lot), there are exciting (and scary) things that I face in my future, some of them may be stressful and unpredictable, but they are still exciting and the unpredictability is part of what makes it exciting.|`|qCU5YEy7aa	well as kids we are able to do whatever and explore, have fun and we can still do that as adults but we have to get serious. We have more responsibility. That's life!|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Children are so care-free, and don't have a thing in the world to care about except not breaking their toys. They don't have to worry about paying income taxes, or paying rent, or paying for utilities, or getting a job, or leasing a car, or anything like that. Children are oblivious to this. To them, it's all taken care of by mommy and daddy, so they don't have to worry.    In high school, you become a little less care-free, especially towards junior and senior year. You have priorities to worry about. You need to focus on getting good grades, you need to focus on preparing for the SATs, you need to focus on college applications. However, to some high school and college students, the prospect of living on your own can be exciting.    Now, I haven't experienced college graduation yet, but my cousin graduated from college, and she said it was the scariest day of her life. Once you graduate, the reality of living on your own, getting a job, renting an apartment or a house can be *very* scary.    As life goes on, it becomes much less exciting, and much less thrilling. You never really know what to expect, so the unpredictability of it all can become a little overwhelming, which causes you to be very stressed, and not have as much fun as you want to.    Adulthood is *very* stressful. When I'm stressed, everything seems a lot less fun, and I'm only in high school. I can only imagine what the stress can do to young adults in the working world.    My underlying point here is that as you grow older, you have a lot of responsibility, and sometimes that responsibility can cause stress, which can then cause lack of interest of excitement.    Might I also add that as you get older, you are sometimes incapable of doing things you could do in college. You can't go out with friends every weekend, because you have priorities to take care of, such as, if you choose to conceive and build a family, watching the children, or working a night job to support your family.    Let me just say that this is all an opinion. I am a teenager, and have yet to graduate from high school and college, and I have yet to enter the real world, but I have heard from my post-college cousin, my father, and my friends' older siblings about this, and this is the best I can come up with to answer your question.    I hope I've helped in some way.|`|YmtNel5haa	yep thats life.    What is that expression?  Familiarity breeds contempt.  You have to inspire yourself sometimes.  I figure as long as I wake up I am going to go through another day.  Like it or not.|`|lnnv29dzaa	It's because when we where kids the world was still a mystery. We didn't really know what was out there and anything was possible. When you grow up your more familiar with the world you live in and you know that there's no monsters under your bed.  That's why I love weed, it brings back all those feelings I had when i was young. Playing with play-doh is fun again!|`|c90TJKe4aa	because you get married thats why life slows down and you hit yourself on the head and say damn|`|UY6c7DG8aa	Well, when we're young our stems cells in our brain give us lots and imagination, which gives excitement. But as we get older we have less imagination.  Your problem is that when you're young, there is like a destiny or something, like christmas or going to college, you wanted to go, and that what made it exciting. But seems to me like you have no goal/destiny in your life right now. I mean if you have a girlfriend/boyfriend (no offence), i'm pretty sure you would be looking forward(excited) about getting married to this person, have kids... Just think about it, that perfect one with you, forever, and live a happy family, having a child that you'll spoil with her?  Your imagination has decreased as you grow older, and you don't dream about the future. If you don't dream about the future, there is nothing to look forward to, that's why life is so boring. Here is what you should do, not imagine, but DREAM your future, think about all of it, and hopefully it will bring some excitement to your life. You still have so many years to go, there are so many good things taht could happen to you, so dream on!|`|7b089b25ed98306d5886ba461eb9a7a1aa	You are in a kind of limbo- an in-between time- a hiatus.

0qYY7cdzaa	You crop for best composition in the finished image. If you shoot news, editorial, advertising for publication you don't have standard studio print sizes, you think about cropping when composing the original. - Something you should always consider.|`|C77c0OE2aa	I agree that cropping is something that I rarely do... almost never to be exact. If you are constantly having to crop your photos, you are not taking your photos properly in the first place. When I compose a photo I am composing the entire frame. Cropping it later never enters my mind. Just like everything else, getting the composition right in the camera FIRST is by far the best way to do it. Your "crop" should be exactly what you see in your viewfinder... a properly composed photo that does not need cropping.    Now... I will add that if I KNOW a photo is to be printed at 8 x 10 or such typical sizes, such as a portrait, then yes, I will allow some extra space for the cropping that naturally occurs when the photo is  printed at that size. But again, I am not actually cropping the photo away from the original composition.    steve|`|i6EJ5B6Laa	Never cut at the joints/bends of any of your body. Examples: elbows, knees, etc. It will make the photo look awkward.|`|AA11002371	There are no real laws or rules for cropping photographs. What I can tell you is this: you want to crop when you want to change the style of the composition, fill the frame, or get rid of distractions that may be at the edge of the frame. Also, the more you crop, the less resolution you get in your image.|`|DZxtwUnFaa	makre sure main subject is not cut at all|`|P2iNMf1paa	I was always told when taking  a picture take it like so that you will not have to crop it very seldom do I ever have to crop a picture . I learned this because I took pictures for art galleries and they did not allow cropping so when I take pictures in my studio I follow the same set of rules. Hope this helps you|`|YdigTxNlaa	pay attn to the background, you want to have a good composition...follow the rule of thirds or go by diagonals...but i would say the rule of thirds is the best to go by until you get the hang of it...also the perspective, like whether you want part of the person or object cut off, or you want it all in the frame.

t0TCctCjaa	Play River Flows in You by Yiruma.  Very pretty, and medium-hard.  So it sounds like you put a lot of effort into it.    I suggest you play it slightly fast because if you play slow, it won't sound as pretty, and if you play it too fast you could make mistakes and that's not really how the song is supposed to be played.  It's supposed to calm and relax.    Good luck!|`|aFEXET4Daa	River Flows in You...it's really hard, but really good.

j7o7RsZKaa	Yes, it CAN make the person a good actor depending on how they use their skill. Being afraid to show your emotions though is not helping your cause. Aske yourself questions. Would I be self concious when showing my emotions on stage?  Do the emotions look real and not played out?  Also, if you can sing you would be perfect for theatre. Here's the first step: take an acting class and see how you like it.|`|PlnO0bHXaa	I'm only in 8th grade, and have never gotten a "lead" in any play, but I consider that your acting skills are superb. If you are in school, I suggest you take a drama workshop (or go to the shakesperean festival). If you don't just say the words as words, if you put life to them, then you have a real talent. Seriously, go for it, do community theater! Sign up for classes! Anything to help you get even better!!!    Good Luck!!!!

p0AUrLgwaa	B. The Confederates won more victories than the union. It was the constant attrition, lack of supplies and foodstuffs, and the lack of any way to reinforce the Armies that finally defeated the South. The union had over 2 million soldiers in uniform, while the Confederacy only had about 900,000 and it still took 4 years for the north to win and they had to resort to war on women and children to win even then.|`|5llBXFF4aa	People are correct that the answer is B - however, some of the comments show very little understanding of the war.  It took four years for a variety of reasons, and poor generalship was indeed one of them, BUT to say that the war was taken to women and children is ludicrous.  Yes, there were abuses by some Union soldiers against civilians - just as there were abuses, rape, murder, and more by Confederate soldiers against free-state citizens.  It was NOT widespread, and it was not more prevalent in the Union army as compared to the Confederate army.    People should read and study a little bit before they speak.|`|OmSJR5UFaa	I agree, B.|`|Iw6vqJd8aa	The answer is B. For the first year of the war, the Confederates won almost every battle. The Union generals were not very aggressive in fighting. They had a tendency to not press the attack.|`|aVqIKPdyaa	B, go!|`|ofMV2sS5aa	I'd say B. For a long time Linkin employed lazy Generals so losses to the south was frequent. But the other answers you can disprove so i think it's B.
Iw6vqJd8aa	It was a culture because the blacks American born or African born, banded together to survive. Just like Anglo-Saxsons banding together to keep ourselves alive. Slaves specially the ones that were abused created a way to communicate with each other over distances and through their songs and drums. Until the slave owners make it against the law for playing drums. They also help create the underground railroad and the songs that gave directions to runaways.     The times of the slave was also considered a culture because the slaves combined the two cultures white and black (African). They combined the religion, thus voodoo, and also induced Islam, the language.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	I guess because it was so long that it was going on it just was a tradittion of some sort

8asG4WCwaa	Did you use the search bar here in Y!A?  This question has been answered many, many, times.    Generally, when you google you will get mostly vanity (self publishing) presses, so that's a problem.  I hear that they pay to keep at the top of the results list.    Real publishers do not need to advertise as much, so if you're not familiar with their names, they are harder to pick out.      Get a copy of the writer's market or author's yearbook.  Most of what you need to know is in there.    Getting published isn't easy, but any worthwhile venture isn't easy, either. Writing is work.  Getting published is work, too. Anything that is easy is likely to be painful later (getting scammed, for example).    Finish the book, first.  Edit it.  Format the manuscript.  Get it critiqued. Edit it again.  repeat as often as needed.  When you're ready to actually think about publishing, you do your research. Then you query agents.  If they're interested, they will ask to see the rest of the manuscript.  If they think they can sell it, they will offer to represent the work to editors at publishing houses.    You need to know the diffeence between traditional publishers, vanity (self publishing) presses, and scams.    Consider joining a reputable writing group (one that is not tied to a vanity press and one that has at least a few members who are traditionally published).  You can learn a lot from other writers.  I like absolutewrite.com/forum (the water cooler).  Keep in mind    1 - real publishers pay you, you do not pay them  2 - real agents get paid after they sell your work, not before  3 - being "available to order online" is not the same as having books on shelves at real stores|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	If you are self-publishing there are services with Amazon where people search for your book, it is printed and shipped to them when they order it.  The profit may be less but it is something you can do immediately.  You should also try to find an agency to promote your book.  People ae buying fewer and fewer books these days.|`|3OUeAuLyaa	You don't want to self-publish if you want to make any money off of your work.    Getting a book commercially published (where you don't pay anyone a dime - people pay you for the right to publish your work) is extremely difficult, but don't let that discourage you. After all, if you don't try, it'll never happen.    What you want to do is first off, finish your book. Edit it as many times as it takes (and we're talking serious edits here, not light ones) to make your book as perfect as you can get it. Have people you trust to tell you the truth (generally not your parents or friends or teachers) about your work go over it and let you know how it is. Then, once you're certain you have a work that's worthy of publishing, you're going to want to look for an agent.    The free way to do this is to go to sites like agentquery.com, where you can search by genre for an agent who will represent your book. You'll send them a query letter and what they ask for (an outline, the first three chapters, etc.), and you wait.    If you're lucky enough to have an agent willing to represent your work, then it's another waiting game as your agent sends your work out to publishers for acceptance or rejection.    Rejection is a part of the publishing process. You WILL be rejected - everyone (and I do mean everyone) is. Don't let it discourage you, and keep trying.    Best of luck to you!|`|JPlVt9xYaa	If you just want one book or a few, go to blurb.com and download their software to which you can attach your book, pictures etc. You will have to do all the work and depending on how many pages, the book will cost from about $12 and up. I usually put my books here before regular publication for two reasons, I want to see how they look in print and secondly, my publisher can preview the first fifteen pages. My 250 page books usually cost me about $40 to $50 in soft cover, hard cover is a little more. Unless you give them permission, they will not sell them to anyone else. But, should you want to sell them, they will take care of collecting the money, sending the book and even give you a few dollars.     Another company is Booksurge.com and it is a long process, they make sure you got it right and I am not sure about their lowest price, but my guess is that it is less than $500, but they will market the book for you.    Then of course, if you have a real good book, a publisher will give you money. ha, that is the hard one.|`|5QkgQBjoaa	Self publishing costs from US$299 to US$12999 depending on your publishing package.    You may find this article I stumbled upon interesting.  It succinctly presents the publishing process as 7Ds:  Decide what to write about  Discover your readers   Dedicate time for writing  Design effectively  Designate a professional editor  Deal with a professional publisher  Distribute the book effectively    Below is the link to the full article:  http://xlibrian.multiply.com/journal/ite...

IBEVI6YQaa	Fannie Flagg books are really good.  I just finished "Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!" and really enjoyed it.  At first I was unsure as to where the story line was headed, but it really turns itself around and I ended up loving it.  It's meaningful with no mystery or science fiction involved.    She also has "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe", upon which the movie of the same name was based off.        Good luck!  I'm also an avid reader and have a loong list of things I want to read. :)|`|ZGlty72daa	I too love Jodi Picoult a very similar author that makes you think and his stories have meaning is Paulo Coelho I would suggest checking out "Veronika Decides To Die" it is AMAZING|`|Q49d8oD1aa	book by Ellen Hopkins  I'm not sure if her books are similar to Jodi Picoult, because I have never read any Jodi Picoult books (sorry)...but, her books are thought provoking...
3OUeAuLyaa	If you're talking about the political interpretations of the Wizard of Oz, then you're talking about a lot more than just the characters.    Here's a site on Wikipedia that'll explain a lot of it to you: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_i...    But in short, Dorothy is supposed to represent the average American, the Tin Man is supposed to represent the factory worker, the Scarecrow the farmer, and the Wizard is supposedly a representation of Theodore Roosevelt.    Check out the site - it explains a lot, and if you want more information, just type "Wizard of Oz metaphors" into your search bar and you'll find a ton of information.|`|54de240068972f3c9a1b7e57ede76763aa	Dorothy: Dorothy is thought to represent the American people or values.    Tin Woodman: represent the industrial worker.    Scarecrow: The scarecrow is thought to represent the western farmers.    Cowardly Lion: There was a politician named William Jennings Bryan in the late 1800's who supported the free silver movement.    Wicked Witch of the East and West: The Wicked Witch of the East is the eastern business while the Wicked Witch of the West is William McKinley

6pUzzsuhaa	its not that hard, its just you don't need to a major work before you get the hang of it... just do a lot of sketches to get the feel of working with pencils (all of em- like 4B, 2H, etc)  i've been drawing and shading with pencil for a long while and its not that hard to pick up, you just need to take time and ask your art teacher to help ya out if your in school (:     you learn it by practicing your self- just sketch stuff and shade it like it would appear (i find looking at back and white pics are the easiest to get started with because it shows you where the shading is)|`|uQmtoDCwaa	you can take a class or get a book on drawing something you really like.  Classes are good because they give you direction.  They don't have to be expensive either.  I went to my local community center & signed up for a beginning drawing class & loved it!  I was so inspired by the teacher & the other artists.  Books are great too.  I have learned a lot from the "how to draw" series that's available @ Michaels craft stores & they're affordable.  Whatever you do, just have fun & relax...don't pressure yourself because the best creativity happens when you're having fun...|`|C8wipA65aa	It is not hard, but it takes patience and the right tools, an artgum eraser is best, and newsprint is great for sketches.  Use the paper medium that is recommended for pencil drawings, and keep a clean cloth handy to "smudge" and give special effects.  Take a class and Enjoy.
7XkBw3bvaa	Alice! She is crazy and fun and ecstatic! She's fun and she has such a bubbly mood. I also love how adorably smug she is about the whole seeing the future ting. She acts so cool you forget about the vampire thing. She seems like the best friend you always want have around. "How can someone so small be so annoying?" I also love what an "unstoppable force of nature" she is. Emmett is my fave boy, though, he's hilarious, especially in Breaking Dawn. " What were you doing last night, discussing the national debt?"LOL "Finally. It's time somebody scored around here."ROFL Also Edward bc he is SO romantic and sweet.

kNhpKy1oaa	This question is very subjective, as there are several phases of Gothic art.     Painting: Pretty much all that exist are religious works. The sculpture elements below also appear in painted works in the Gothic.     Sculpture: Chiasmic pose ("X" shape created with limbs) in the Early Gothic/Transitional style; muldenfaltenstil (following, naturalistic drapery) in the 1200-Style period; smooth-cheeked, emotionless figures with linear drapery in the period of the Severe Style; Gothic S-curve (elongated and expressive figures with a slight "s"-like curve in body position) during the Courtly Gothic;     Architecture: Flying buttresses, pointed arches, Reims-style tracery windows (predominantly stained glass held in place by a system of tracery elements), a desire for height and thinness in structures, sculpture on facades.     Hopefully this is somewhat helpful. Gothic Art is produced over an extensive period of time and the style changes frequently.

BLsZitfCaa	No way! Check some local dance studios. Chances are, you'll want to look at a less competitive studio, but just look around. There are plenty of adult Ballet classes that are for 16+. At the studio I go to, I've seen some students from thirty to sixty learning all types of dance!    The only thing I'd tell you, is don't be too afraid or too prideful to not go. If you really want to, then you should go and do ballet because you love it.     As someone who started dancing a little late, to another, I really hope that you join. It's never too late, and it's so much fun, especially when you really want something.    Hope I helped,    ---Linzz.|`|G4a8Yfjeaa	No, it really is never too late to start learning to dance.You just can't go pro at the age you're at now. Your obesity isn't an issue I don't think, but I think it would help you very much if you lost a few pounds first. You don't have to be a stick, just maybe give yourself a month or two to loose weight. While you're at it, taking ashtanga yoga would be a great workout AND it will get you limber and well prepared for ballet! So when you're ready, you will have the shape and flexibility to do ballet as a hobby. If you want to go pro...well...miracles happen but...its unlikely. If you really want to though, work as hard as you can and get good stable friends and family to back you up and be there for you 24/7. Best of luck! :D|`|babEVfBwaa	definitely not, dancing is fun and you shouldn't be put in a class with five year old's. Usually there is a class for adults this might make you more comfortable. Ballet is a good way to get in shape as it devlops long lean muscles so i say go for it!!!!     I am a dancer too but I have rcently broken my leg, I don't advise that lol =]|`|txI8rKYdaa	HECK NO!!  Do what you want to do! Live your Life! Yeah you should probably lose some weight. No you won't be put with 5 year olds. Just ask for your age of class.

KniVes is the plural of Knife.    This is  GOOD piece of writing|`|c92d48030d0612c8b4dec267d2dd1d86aa	there are some other spelling errors as well as "knifes", but overall this is really good.  I like the imagery towards the end of the negative aspects of war.  They contrast nicely with the beginning of the poem where war is about glory and honor.
4J8X1aKkaa	There's no central online database that includes all listings of all cemeteries, and not all cemetery/burial listings can be found on the internet so it takes some digging.     1. Obituaries often will announce the burial site  2. Occasionally death records tell who the coroner released the body to which can lead you to a mortuary service which can lead you to a cemetery.  3. A few large databases: ancestry.com, findgraves.com, and interment.net are the biggies. U.S. http://www.deathindexes.com/  4. Military records  5. Cyndi's list http://www.cyndislist.com/deaths.htm  6. Local genealogical or historical societies and gen web projects often have local cemetery listings  7. If you have an idea of the city where they're buried you can search for each cemetery in that area and search their records.  8. Church or parish records  9. Estate records   10. Family Bibles or journals.    With all those records available, keep in mind that there won't be a record for everyone. In some places in some times it was a common practice to bury loved ones in a family plot, essentially....the backyard.  Many pioneers were simply left behind.  Native Americans had their own practices.  It really depends on who you're looking for, when they lived, where they lived, and who they lived with.|`|AA11053540	Try www.findagrave.com, or perhaps the SSDI (Social Security Death Index).|`|Bp6254Vbaa	You could try it here, maybe they also provide something like that.    here's the URL's    www.web-detective.com  www.people-search.com|`|mzRSO802aa	It usually will indicate on the death certificate who the body was released to and that usually is the funeral home.  Then you can call the funeral home and they can check their files.  Sometimes it will tell you the name of the cemetery on the death certificate.
aVqIKPdyaa	Ancient Spartans aren't the same as the ones in 300.  Without modern Protein shakes and fancy equipment it is extremely difficult to gain the mass and tone of a modern day human, not to mention that Greeks tend to have a smaller build then Nords (Northern Europe) and peoples of Celtic Origin.  In reality, they were probably about 5'8-5'9 maybe 160lbs.  Though I agree that Spartans were much more fit then most ancients due to rigorous daily lives, I also think that they were probablly a little weaker then a modern day average gym-goer (3 days a week).    As for the Spartans in 300, they had personal trainers to teach them. So, if you want to look like one of THOSE Spartans, you have to start working out.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	The movie '300' is fiction, that's not what people in ancient times looked like.  There were frequent famines - every five years - so anyone needed to have a little pot around the belly, and the capacity to gain weight, to survive these famines.  That accounts for the average person.  For a soldier, eating might be even more irregular.  Also - If they did the same as Roman gladiators - they would eat a diet high in barley, specifically to cultivate a protective layer of fat just under the skin; good protection in battles.   So as for the six-pac...pretty well non-existent.
6WIGAXnqaa	Well, my initials are CJR, and I go by CJ.  So maybe you could possibly go by JC?  Knowing your first name would help...    For example, my first name is Cassaundra, and some people either call me by my initials, or the call me Cassie.    Knowing your middle name might help as well.  Mine is Jeanelle, and sometimes my parents call me Jeanie (Genie)    So yeah...  :]
iEfz0H62aa	how about trying to look for an out fit where the top is considered a A-line. What that means is that it fits at the neck and shoulders and then flares out to end usually about mid-calf for a dress and mid-thigh for a top. Then the pants should be elastic waistband so they can expand when you blow up. In order to keep then top form fitting use a belt that will loosen when you blow up. It is the same basic idea that they used in the original Willy Wonka movie.
mRvZq0VZaa	After reading The Catcher and the Rye in high school, I felt the same way.|`|R02aazVdaa	No, I think its nice you find common ground with such a misunderstood character like Holden Caulfield.|`|0093869f07845dd527b36638eab7a303aa	No but it is bad that you don't even know the correct title of the book that you are reading.

For example, what was with the pudgy thighs part? I didn't unsdertsand that part or your use of "they" in the :"they come to you iwth tears in thier eyes" because I thought the parents were ocmpletely out of the picture.  The rest made sense and was good.  My only suggestion would be to maybe reword a few parts.  for example the couldnt handle mommy taking her life part.. the words dont flow very nicely there, and i am sure you can use your awesome writing capabilities to describe that better.  KEEP IT UP.... just a little revision and you ahve a master piece!|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	I really liked it! Creative! Hope this helped!|`|y4uoDjV0aa	That was beautiful. I liked it.

qQWYeOpgaa	OK well do your basic stretches first, like bending down to touch your toes, v-sits runners lunge, and stuff, then do your splits, also if you do them after you take a shower, then your more warmed up.  O and many people forget to keep their hips square, it might appear that you are less flexible, but when they are square it helps your leap, and are required in most dance, especially ballet.|`|QBNRbODBaa	This is something that will come gradually. Don't try to force it, and don't do splits if you're not warmed up. You should stretch every day (well, almost every day), and continue to stretch every day to maintain it.|`|pbTXcRjGaa	im sure youve heard its important to stretch before, and know it will take a while and everything. but the thing that helped me most is when you think youve gone the farthest you can go, lift your hands off the ground. it will hurt but you'll realize you can go so much farther than you thought! :)
aOy01jFEaa	Hi....^^  Now, I think that this silly thing comes into the mind when we're focused on the darker side of the thoughts from disappoinments and frustrations..We want to slip away from the misery at once. It just piss off annoyingly, when that particular eerieness insists on to invade our very own person. But then if we just have only to realize that this is a good example of being self absurbed, by irritating circumstances that we desparately try to surmount..  Just today before I paused awhile to take a glimpse on a cnn news..I have been feeling desparate when I saw many helpless refugees from some part of Asian sea shores..Trying their best to get off their crowded wooden boat to look for a life and so as well to survive..All that they've been welcomed for was only being captured like slaves, punished and being badly treated or horribly whipped..All the while I was thinking of being devastated from life before those kind of stories appeared right through my eyes. I felt ashamed of myself. Being very selfish to have this position.  When others could have deserve it more than I do as one may feel their passion to live and struggle.. Cause I have been guilty thinking that life was a waste at times when frustrations struck into my person. Yet, it had been always about 'my person' only..Why can't we try thinking of others too, somehow? Then have a little noble gesture to count on through. If ever we've done too much for others and ended up foolishly..Maybe we have gotten the wrong choice to direct our good deeds? Or maybe that will pay off with unexpected unseen blessings, if ever. But it may still sound unrealistic that way though. Hopefully, we may feel good feeling worthy with some little things we can share or appreciate in life.    And yes, by the way. I suggest why not kill the time to end that darkness as an alternative..It's not you anyway that should end. It's just that lil' silly thing in you that wanes..I guess.  Now, kill it!     '....|`|AA11635601	Okay cannot exist in a vacuum - ok means ok WITH SOMEONE.  In this case, with who?  Who are you asking if it is ok with?  Us?  Society in general?  Some sort of societal more?  All fair questions, but you'd need to figure out which one you meant.    No, it's not ok.  People in general find it horrifying when someone dies.  Dying at your own hand is still murder and is shocking and abhorrent to everyone.  To you too, though in a state of despair you may not realize it.    In general, I think most people would agree that it is only "okay" to kill yourself if you face an immediate fate worse than death and there is nothing else you can do - like those poor people burning to death in the world trade center buildings who jumped.  For them, that was the only thing to do.  For you, someone who could presumably take some action to change their life, to waste a young life would be a crime against humanity - not to mention murder on your part.    Not okay.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	We are here to learn, nothing more, nothing less.  Since life is a lesson, if you leave in the middle of it, that just means you're gonna have to come back and finish... kinda like a make-up test. I don't fear death because I see it as a transition between two planes of existence. I believe we are born, we learn, we die. Some of us come back to continue learning, some of us don't.       As far as killing myself; life is so short as it is and death is making its way to me as we speak, so I think I'll just wait my turn :-D|`|UY6c7DG8aa	Well here is the thing. No matter how worse your life gets, there is still a chance of it getting better, like 1~100%  But if you kill yourself, then there won't be any chance at all to make your life better, in order words 0% chance of it getting better.  1~100%>0% Don't you think?  I've seen people who thought life couldn't get any worse, and planned on killing themselves but they didn't, and it all turned out to get better, when they think back, they feel that killing themselves is the stupidest idea ever.  It is okay to kill yourself, but why not stay alive, and give it a shot?|`|FmbwIbtzaa	As I read your message I see self the (I) factor and nothing else. If we only live this life for self then it is not a worthy reason to live. Consider God the Universal Father has poured out himself, as it were, to make all creation rich in personality possession and potential spiritual attainment. God has given us himself that we may be like him, and he has reserved for himself of power and glory only that which is necessary for the maintenance of those things for the love of which he has thus divested himself of all things else.    5. THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE              There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending. Everything familiar to us has an end.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	As far as only you are concerned, - maybe.  But you also belong to those around you.  They might need you to stick around.|`|az2ZBy3iaa	Sure. Assuming the logic assumption holds and general pragmatism applies. When faced with two choices, always pick the better one that results in more utility, even if it's death.|`|spYpsixUaa	Only if fear is the only reason that Life could be better than the alternative.  If I wasn't afraid to die, but didn't think that the prospects of an afterlife were all that appealing, I can't accept that despairing my fate could be counted as fear.    Therefore, the answer is "Not."|`|L0uxPZgKaa	this seems very similar to the "is the death penalty moral" question.  many people would say "no, because killing is wrong"  but really, if you interviewed the prisoners (and obviously people have) they would tell you "i'd rather die than suffer a life in prison"    so i guess you're right because if life really is worse than the alternative, then why let that person suffer, let them die. but that seems a little insensitive... and dont go killing yourself just because i said this, but that would make a me a hypocrite.... im so confused! -_-|`|fwIe1sQwaa	If you die, it's like game over, man.    You don't know what may happen. Maybe by this time of year, years from now, whatever problems you're dealing with will all be resolved. Maybe things will get better. Killing yourself is throwing all that away.|`|fDHOKkjdaa	I'm not used to write much like this on philosophy, but I think, I've managed to bring an interesting answer based upon serious critic thoughts and logic.    What I can see is that you have two obvious choices:  Life or death.    Does suicide is a solution or an illusion?    To answer this, you must get an idea of what's true and what's not.    To find truth, you must think to avoid mental reflexes and opinions getting through your judgment. Rationality and logic brings the structure of the answer as doubt and criticism brings the question.    I'd therefore define the search as being:  "A constant reconsideration of a given conception, believed to be true, by critic means, using logic and rationality to confirm or demolish this given conception through a questioning."    So, what's true according to this definition of the search?   A conception on which no reasonable doubt can be shown and that is explained logically with rationality.    You can consider something to be true until it has been demonstrate not to be.    Suicide is an illusion and not a truth. I can demonstrate it by qualifying it of reassurance.     Why would we want to achieve knowledge? To be happy, to be real.     Everything aside truth is an illusion, a distortion meant to comfort the man through his lack of knowledge. We are feared by the reality, the possibilities because it can change the actual state of things. What's the interest of the actual state of things: we know it cannot be worse, nor better as it is constant staying the same. Change brought a chance to wreck this stability.     This distortion brings you to be dependent of your conceptions and therefore, from the world as you need it to fit them to be safe. The ultimate conclusion is inevitable: Independence brings freedom and happiness. You need to know and evolve not to be dependent. If I substitute, Knowledge is then Happiness.    Suicide is an easy escape. Like the other distortions, it prevents you from suffering, but with this comes the inevitable thing of not being happy. It is then an illusion. And therefore, you cannot choose as a reasonable solution as an illusion cannot be a true answer.    Does it implies that life is the choice? It implies that you can change your life and be happy, what ever happens.    Because your disconnection from the illusions bring peace, you cannot be unhappy and therefore, your question becomes a non-sens. Life is then the True answer.      CONCLUSION  As Truth is define by its quest which requires rationality and logic, illusions or non-truth are no acceptable answers. Reassurances are illusions made to conquer the fear of the reality and it implies that the independence brings the things around no longer to influence your mood. This shows that you need to know in order to be independent and happy. Then as suicide prevents suffering, but it avoid happiness, according to my definition, it is an illusion, a non-truth and therefore cannot be the right answer. As it no longer make sense to be unhappy, the choice is obvious as it brings happiness: LIFE.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Before you kill yourself, you must look at the alternatives and see whether are they better than the life you are having now.    If you are atheist -> no after life so body turn back into atoms   If you are a jew/muslim/christian -> spent Eternity in hell  If you are a hindu/buddhist -> reincarnated to another life that may be just as bad as this one.    When you thought killing yourself will solve the problem. But in fact, it may produce more problems.    Life is not always good nor always bad. When you thought that it will become worst, it may become better. When you thought that it will become better, it become worst. Life is full of uncertainty.    The fact that everything changes means that individuals are nudged by doubt. What was good becomes bad, what was happy becomes sad, what was true becomes false, what was birth becomes death, what was love becomes anger, what was rich becomes impoverished. The pendulum swings back and forth. Whatever its joys and sorrows, this life can be pretty uncertain. The uncertainty and doubt that change can seem to create are called suffering by Buddhists.    If killing yourself is a solution to a problem. Then the human race should be extinct thousands of years ago.|`|O15my3olaa	Before taking your own life, always consider how much time, money and effort you, your parents, siblings, and other close relatives and friends, etc have spent to get you this far.     Consider too, on the ensuing trouble and pain,  that so many would have to endure for a long time, following your departure. Could you have delayed it, or even discarded the thought altogether, when things are likely to improve and fortune to return? To be impulsive and take one's life, or the lives of whole family members, in anger because of a reason/ problem or two is never a wise or courageous decision action. One should explore various avenues of solutions first; one should become really humble and be prepared for sacrifices. Losing a loved one in a natural disaster, or a job for a short while, is not a justifiable reason for suicide/s.    So it pays to look for several alternatives to a  problem, for better survival. Be patient, creative and willing to face unpleasant changes and you would receive respect and admiration for your tenacity and courage. Those who fear they may lack these, should watch the TV series "Beyond Boundaries", in which a group of disabled persons endured a long and arduous journey through the harsh African terrain. Will change the able-bodied persons' outlook on courage, survival and how life ought to be lived.     To take the easiest path through personal or mass suicide, unless due to terminal  illness or a court's death penalty, borders more on immorality and cowardice.

The emulsion won't accept the ink and it will probably just rub off.    Besides, why in the world would you want to waste REAL silver halide photographic paper in your printer?  Did you expose it to light by mistake?      Real photo paper is made for developing pictures in a darkroom, with an enlarger and chemicals.  Like someone else said, it's a completely different thing.  If you haven't exposed the paper yet and it's still sealed in the package, please don't ruin it by exposing it to light.  If you don't want it, give it to someone who is interested in photography and can use it to develop pictures in a darkroom.  You could even sell it on eBay, and if you sell it for cheap, someone WILL buy it, because there are a lot of people who are interested in film and traditional photography.|`|AA10690306	Nope, the RC paper is silver based printing and the printer is ink based printing.

If you need a good D, use normal C fingering with side G  key or second trill key from the top. I'm not sure how they work with the bottom trill keys open, but it might sharpen the open D enough.

Ahud6tPZaa	Improvisation is unrehearsed, there's really no right or wrong way to approach it. Well, I say that, but improvisation shouldn't be played for effect, or laughs, or to try and "show off".    There isn't really anything you can prepare. The only advice I can give is to observe people. Sit in a coffee shop and watch, unobtrusively, how people react to each other. Eavesdrop of a situation to find out how the interaction goes. Most of our lives are lived through sensory material, but we miss most of it because we don't pay attention.    In improvisation use a mixture of yourself, reactions you've seen in other people in response to certain situations, and ultimately - make it up as you go. That's improvisation, after all.
UsTyc0oeaa	The best way to work on it and get better is by DOING it.  In other words, go out and find places where you can improvise, and then start improvising!    I don't know what type of performing you are talking about, but this same advice applies to most types of performances.  If you are a comedian, go to open mic nights at your local comedy clubs.  If you are a musician, try local bars or coffee houses and talk to the managers about playing on their slower nights and off-peak hours.  If you are a street performer, go out and street perform whatever skill you do.

When the Senate recalled Caesar from his Proconsul duties, he crossed into Latium and began a Roman civil war (just after Marius and Sulla had done previously).  After, he granted himself powers of numerous offices to make him basically king in all but name.  He was NOT the first Dictator, contrary to popular belief.    As for impact on US, the Roman Republic has had the greatest effect if that helps at all.  Think about it:  A Senate just as the Romans, founded after a Republican system just as the Romans (though taking in Democratic policies).  Hell, even our money has Latin on it ;)|`|AA12097624	The story and lessons learned during the Roman period would and still influence the past and future leaders. The Greek and Roman histories are treasure chests of valuable life lessons and reflections on human nature. While it would be very difficult to estimate the influence of one man on the minds people in Americas history. It is clear that politicians in the past have used the Roman days as a sort of guide to being an Empire. After all Rome lasted 1000 years.   His life would have effected the decisions of people mainly based on how the events of his life influenced them and how they interpret it. You would have to ask them.

You should be able to get answers to most of your questions.|`|RzbRRUOdaa	You may want to check this site about self-published books on children.  http://publishingthechildinme.blogspot.c...|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your children's book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing  at affordable costs.    The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. Publishing packages are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.    Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now.    Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose books are of the highest quality, bar none.    Xlibris Publishing is one of those companies who truly boasts of their books top quality as your book is printed on acid-free 50lb library-edition paper. That alone can give your book a longer shelf life and durable pages.    Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your books production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.    Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.    You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.    I hope I helped.
dh42Aksiaa	Im a classical guitar conservatoire graduate with lots of performance and teaching experience. I say this not to impress somebody, but simply because from my experience of learning and teaching the classical guitar there is only one real answer to your question:    As a pro classical guitar player, my suggestion is to get a classical nylon string guitar. Having said that though, I will tell you what you can do in your current situation so you dont feel like youre standing still:    1. Do not replace strings with nylon strings because in most cases the actual nylon strings (top 3) will not fit in the grooves of the steel string, and even if they did, the thickness of the strings would make them very close together. So if you have to stay with the steel string for a while, then dont change the strings.    2. Get a guitar method and slowly go over it. Ill replay here what I answered in  another question: Get a classical guitar method! One such as those from Mateo Carcassi or Sagreras. These books cover all the thing you mentioned (including note reading and how it relates to the guitar neck, technique and interpretation), but the they do it in an educational manner that has been proven to get results. These books have been written in such a way as to gradually give you tangible results.  Because they are method books, they teach the student in a progressive and correct way, and as a result you may find yourself tackling your favorite piece easily and with great results.  They use exercises as well as studies (musical pieces  devoted to teaching you a certain technique) to build your technical as well as interpretative skills.  Besides teaching technique, methods also facilitate intimate knowledge of your instrument, which is just a fancy way of saying that you will know your guitar inside and out. But can you really teach yourself classical guitar? Yes, you can. Two of the greatest classical guitar players ever, Tarrega and Segovia, where self taught.     3. Get a metronome and start working with it (or use a free one on your computer by going here and scrolling down.. http://www.geocities.com/bancika/softwar... )    These 3 simple steps will keep you progressing along until you will be able to get a nylon string. And even if you never get the nylon, the steps noted here will build a SOLID guitar foundation for you. Hope this helps.     Best wishes,  Ben Dressen  http://www.RezZonator.com|`|bZud91iuaa	Guitars designed for steel strings are not adaptable to the classical style.  The size and width of the fingerboards is quite different.  Nylon strings on a steel string instrument will not work.  You can purchase a decent classical Yamaha for about $150.00.      The two styles are totally different.  Finger picks can be used on the steel strings to pick a pattern such as folk and even some rock.  Classical uses the nails on your fingers to "pluck" each string and desired note.  The varying chord patterns are different too, that's why the fingerboards are wider on a classical model.    My suggestion, if you really want to play classical, trade in the steel strings model for the classical guitar.

It has seasons similar to Chicago or New York.  Very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter.  Vietnam is a tropical country dominated by jungles.  This dictates how wars are fought.Vietnam's jungles make guerrilla warfare easier than Korea.    Second, Korea was a most conventional war.  Both sides used tanks, airplanes, artillery, and conventional infantry.  There was some guerrilla fighting.  By guerrilla I mean a form of terrorism.   Civilians who would not wear uniforms and do hit and run attacks and then blend back into the populous.  This is different from commando warfare where full time soldiers sneek behind enemy lines to cause havoc.  Most of the combat was between uniformed enemies.  The first phase (1950-51) was like World War II.  Huge armies sweeping back and fourth.  The second phase (1951-1953) was like World War I.  Huge lines of trenches separated two sides who would try to gain small amounts of ground.  Essentially there was a front line in both instances.    Vietnam was mostly a guerrilla war for most of the time until 19698.  From 1968 to 1971 it slowly turned into a commando war.  Towards the end in the early 1970's it became a conventional war.  In fact, as US reduced its troops, the North Vietnamese turned more to regular warfare.  Unlike the Koreans, the North Vietnamese would limit regular warfare with the US.  They knew the US would win.    Third, it was the leadership.  The North Vietnamese leader, Ho Chi Mihn, was a nationalist legend.  He had been fighting for Vietnamese independence since the 1920's.  North and South, he was beloved by the people.       The Korean leaders did not have such reputations.  The North Korean leader was a Soviet educated operative.  After World War II, when the Soviets occupied North Korea, they put him in charge.  He was not self-made like Ho Chi Mihn.  The South Korean leader was American educated and trained.  The US helped him com to power after World War II when they occupied South Korea.  Prior, Korea had been a Japanese colony since the 1890's.  Both these men worked for Korean independence in their own way, but they weren't the legend Ho Chi Mihn was.  The North Korean leader did not have a huge following in the South and the South Korean leader did not have one in the North.  Ho Chi Mihn was a symbol of resistance and unity in North and South Vietnam.    Fourth , Korea did not have a huge independence movement  while united and occupied by Japan.  There was some.  While a French colony, Vietnam was united and under Ho Chi Mihn, the Vietnamese had a huge resistance movement and network.    Fifth, Korea had traditionally been a client state.  It either was subservient to China or to Japan.  It had moments of resistance, but it would often choose to be a client state of China.    Vietnam fought Chinese occupation for a 1000 years.  They never gave up.  Resisting a superpower to the very end is part of their history.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	It's perfectly fine.  The shutter is BEHIND the lens, on the camera body itself, so taking the lens off will not expose the film.  In fact, when you take the lens off you will see the shutter blades on the camera (or sometimes it's a curtain).    If you look at your other lenses, the blades you will see in the lens is just the aperture.  That just controls how much light comes into the camera....but the film will not be exposed until you actually fire the shutter.  Now if you're using an SLR with manual exposure, HOPEFULLY you know how to set the shutter speed and F-stop!    But yeah, of course you can take the lens off and swap the lenses with film loaded in the camera.  The shutter will stay closed and your film will be fine.|`|k8AcVixTaa	Nope.

Lou Ann!'  and more silence  and more rattling of the door and a knock! knock! knock!  and silence    The dark figure took out his cell phone and walked away  talking to someone gesturing with his hand  Then the police came...  and an ambulance  and another police car  and some guy dressed in a clown suit  (with big duck feet)  and a nosey neighbor from across the street  named Jack   with his weeny dog    They all huddled at the street in a circle  like a football team deciding their next play  When they decided they clapped their hands   and in single file approached the front door    They knocked once  then twice  then thrice    The guy knocking turned and looked at the guy behind him  and the guy behind him said, "get the prybar"  (which he pulled out from his belt like   someone would do a sword in a quentin tarantino movie)   and started working on the door  then the door popped open with a crack from the wood in the door frame    and there she was  laying face down   on the floor  not breathing  just silence   (except 'Achy Breaky Heart   by Billy Ray Cyrus' playing in the background)    Love and Tragedy|`|WbRuTjmFaa	The Highwayman   by Alfred Noyes... read it..|`|aFFGfGvTaa	romeo and juliet lol|`|gtgJTFOoaa	does it have to be one person ?  you can act as if you are a person who survived a war, and talk about the men in his platoon, and perhaps talk about his love for a certain soldier. brotherly love.|`|KwipSpZbaa	rape of the lock...

nuOpzUReaa	Because when a woman marries a man, she becomes his property.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Women were not allowed to own property, vote, serve in the military, run for political office, go to college, be ordained or preach, at various times in the history of Western Civilization, dear. We were a male-dominated society for a long, long time.     There are some old testament verses about women keeping silent and obeying their husbands. Some fundamentalist Christians still follow that rule, although they have relaxed the one about wearing 50% cotton and 50% polyester. * They pick and choose.    So, when women married they took his name. He was more important.    Dale Evans didn't, when she married Roy Rogers. She was an exception.    * Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.     Leviticus 19:19|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Way back before surnames, way back before modern society, way back before "sexism," Indo-European cultures developed that centered around the hearth fire. The women were "keepers" of that hearth fire, but when she married, she accepted the gods that were worshiped by her husbands family.    Please note that Viking women were hardly considered property: If a woman wanted a divorce she need merely put on her husbands clothes, walk down the street, and they were divorced. They also ran the civilization while the men were away trading or raiding.     As for more modern eras, standard surnames came in to use by governments (particularly English) so they could keep account of men for taxation and conscriptive purposes.    It would be simplistic to ascribe this tradition to "male sexism" as we call it today: most was just born of custom, need, or division of labor.    Please note that you will not find women's names on early UK or American census forms. It's not that they were unimportant, it's that they were tax exempt, and unavailable for military service.|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	It was a tradition started when people still believed that when a woman married a man she became his property. So she took his name as proof of that. Sorry ladies.|`|TT6Nk0JNaa	Because it's tradition, and  it is tradition because our society evolved from patriarchal, male-dominated societies where the guy was the important one.  Of course, now lots of women keep their own name or hyphenate or something.|`|4J8X1aKkaa	They don't always.  The tradition is common in patriarchal (male based) societies, which there are more of today. In matriarchal  (female based) societies that isn't necessarily the pattern. In some societies a hyphenated name is common.  Even in traditional patriarchal societies the practice isn't nearly as common today as it was in the past.  Many women in the U.S., for example, keep their name or use a hyphenated name.  Occasionally (rarely) the man will take wife's name.    The practice makes sense when looking at the function of marriage as creating a new family. One of the first ties of family is the surname so it stands to reason that one or the other of the partners changes their name to create a common family name.|`|GpYAmDuDaa	Because supposedly men are the only one who can carry on the family name, because they are considered to be the head of the house.    but you can keep your own last name if you want now, or keep your name and take your husbands name.    theres a choice now, so its ok. haha.|`|VH29BFuGaa	It's just what's become the "normal" thing to do.

7tsoF4Vbaa	"Impacts" isn't an historically appropriate word. Archaeologists have shown that the Code was collected from existing laws in Mesopotamia, so it didn't introduce anything new to Mesopotamian society. Most scholarly sources agree that the Code was designed as a conservative instrument, i.e. that it was supposed to protect society as it was, instead of introducing new ideas or trying to bring change.    The effects of the Code are hard to talk about because surviving Mesopotamian court documents show that judges used the Code as guidelines or suggestions instead of as strict rules, especially relating to punishments.     So, shorter answers might be: 'women were' solidified in their place as legally inferior to men in regards to property rights and sexual freedom within marriage, although in the absence of evidence they were presumed innocent when charged with a crime.    'The Code led to' a common legal experience within the Babylonian Empire; it also led to the continued preservation of a strict and oppressive social hierarchy.    The Constitutional Rights Foundation (crf.org) has some good info on the code in its world history materials; there are a couple of law school websites that have informative pages. If you have access to the JSTOR database, it has more articles on the Code than you can shake a stick at.    That is, if my experience and book research from teaching the Code as part of a world history course for the past 12 years doesn't count.|`|N8UKu0WUaa	the idea of equality was introduced (it wasn't real equality, but it was introduced), courts, judges and lawyers were also introduced. lastly the law was "codified", meaning it was written down-- this is the first codified law in history, also i believe the law was announced orally for those who couldn't read

ceBTTCPwaa	Strange Pilgrims (original Spanish-language title: Doce cuentos peregrinos) is a collection of twelve loosely-related short stories by the Nobel Prize winning Colombian writer Gabriel Garca Mrquez.    Not published until 1992, the stories that make up this collection were originally written during the seventies and eighties. Each of the stories touches on the theme of dislocation, and the strangeness of life in a foreign land, although quite what "foreign" means is one of Mr Garcia Marquez's central questions in this book. Mr Garcia Marquez himself spent some years as a virtual exile from his native Colombia.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Pil...

VOZWgWgLaa	The Lusitania's involvement in WWI came from when the ship was built. When the Cunard Line began the construction of the Lusitania and its sisters, Mauritania and Aquitainia, the cost was so great that they had to take out a loan from the British government. To pay off this loan, the Cunard Line agreed to turn the ship over to the British government as an Armed Merchant Cruiser, should Britain go to war. And this partially laid the seeds for its own sinking in 1915.    The Lusitania wasn't directly brought into the Royal Navy when WWI began, but, the British government did have the ship carry military supplies across the Atlantic. The Mauritania was recruited as a Merchet Cruiser and was already in the Mediterranean for the Gallipoli campaign. On the Lusitania's final journey, the German submarine didn't actually identify the Lusitania as the Lusitania. They weren't close enough.They only identified the class, which to their knowledge would identify either a Merchant Cruiser in the Royal Navy, or at least a ship carrying munitions (which the Lusitania was carrying). The Uboat fired one torpedo at the Lusitania, which crippled the ship. Shortly after the impact, a second explosion rocked the ship, which many passangers and British people believed to be a second torpedo. However, there is evidence that munitions being carried by the Lusitania or a coal dust explosion might be the real responsibility for the second exlosion. The Lusitania sank rapidly killing most of its passangers, including 128 American citizens.    The sinking of the Lusitania had many consequences. Because of the loss of American life, it is one of the reasons for the eventual American entry into WWI in 1917. The international reaction to the sinking stopped the German unrestricted Uboat campaign until 1917-1918 when the war became so desperate that they needed the Uboats to take Britain out of the war, and that attempt failed.    In the end, no changes were brought on the British side by the sinking of the Lusitania. Innocent citizens continued to sail on ships bound for Britain or France and these ships continued to carry American munitions to be sold to the Allies. In WW2, the British would employ the same thing again. The Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth were taken over as Armed Merchent Cruisers and used as troop transports, cargo vessels for weapons and equipment.    On the German side, it would create vast changes in how the German navy would conduct the Uboat war in WW2. Karl Doenitz, a WWI Uboat veteran conducted a very thorough campaign in which the German Uboats fought a very restricted campaign in comparison to the Uboat campaign of WWI. Only one British passanger liner was torpedoed by German submarines of WWII as Doenitz wanted to avoid the propoganda nightmare that came out of the Lusitania sinking.|`|N8UKu0WUaa	it led to the USA entering the war.    what impacts? well, the USA joined the war.    what changes did it bring?... the USA joined the war in an alliance with Britain, France, Canada, etc    why was it important?... well i think it's important because the USA joined the war.... which is obviously important... you're teacher may be looking for an answer along the lines of "America helped win the war", but that is untrue, it's only American propaganda-- the USA entered the war too late|`|IBEVI6YQaa	The Lusitania was a passenger cruise liner from Britain and was sunk by a German U-Boat in 1915.  It is thought that the sinking of this ship caused many to turn opinions on the German to a negative light and was influential in the United States' decision to join the war since over 130 American citizens were on board.  President Woodrow Wilson responded to the sunken ships by trying to persuade the Germans to abandon their submarine campaign.  In his notes, he stated that Americans had the right to be on any sort of commercial vessel, regardless of which flag it sailed under.  He also stated that any other sinkings would be considered "deliberately unfriendly".  Since attacks on passengers ships was not permitted, U-Boats were recalled and only allowed in the North sea for warfare.
nDcSY8UQaa	by playing it and looking at it. Why? did you read the manuel? good for you!  Throw the allen wrench that came in the package away and skip that part in the manuel, Takamine is pretty good with there quality control, but if in doubt take it to a shop.|`|HJnk5zjyaa	To be honest if you bought a Takamine for $120 the action is definitely going to be high.  But there is no such thing as too high, bluegrass players have their actions towering to generate volume.  But if the guitar is too hard for you to play and too painful, you should lower it.  Don't use the allen wrench, sand down the saddle. If you don't know what the saddle is, its the white piece where your strings bend over before it passes over the soundhole, at the body end of the guitar. Some people will say that leaving a high action will build callouses but if its not fun to play, then you'll just end up not playing.  Don't sand the saddle down too much or else your strings will start hitting the frets on the neck causing a really really annoying buzz. Start sanding about 1/8 of an inch at a time.

GDJGNYFcaa	You're 13, huh? It's a big world, with a lot of great photos left in it. The issue is finding them. If you're really serious about this you need to start off the right way to get a technical leg up on all the other kids that decide they want to do this. Go to a local camera store and see if they can set you up with an old canon, nikon, or pentax 35mm setup. A body and 50mm lens will run you about $150 for one that works, but is by no means extravagant. Get a good text (Black and White Photography,  Henry Horenstein) and set off taking pictures of anything and everything you think is interesting. Right off the bat you'll be spending less money on something that will always be relevant. Film is becoming sort of the lost art with the younger folks, as cameras are catching up, but that's only good if you've got the big bucks and can make it work when it counts. Do this with over the counter kodak film and get comfortable with it. The next step will be darkroom technique, which hopefully they'll teach at your highschool. It's all the old antiquated boring stuff that the guys with the big view cameras used back in the 1800's that's always going to mean the most. When you can make your prints start to finish in the darkroom, then you'll have what it takes to get out there and be a serious photographer who'll be a lot harder to compete with than someone who picked up a nikon dslr right out of the gate and started snapping. Trust me.    Setting up a flickr to get feedback on your stuff is a good idea, too.

Well, what I do know is at 13 is when I got my first digital camera.  Nikon is the top end and they make the best you can get.  Look at their COOLPIX series of cameras and pick one out you like.  As you get older you will perhaps want to consider a DSLR like the D40 and experiment with that.  What you do have to do is read up a lot on Aperture, Composition, Shutter Speed.  It seems boring, and it is, but it's incredibly useful info and there will come times where it will be absolutely mandatory you need to know it.  I'm only 21 and I have a D80 and I love it.  But it can be frusturating at times.  I find i have to take the same shot over and over again before i get the one i want.  /you will find this too.  Just be patient.  First of all, go to Nikonusa.com and look at their range of COOLPIX cameras.  Save up for it and remember to bring it EVERYWHERE you go.  Take pictures of random, things.  Friends, street signs, silly faces, anything.  Just anything to get more comfortable with your camera.    Cillian.    Contact me if you want to talk more about it.

4ilM2hCwaa	In 1593 tulips were brought from Turkey and introduced to the Dutch. The novelty of the new flower made it widely sought after and therefore fairly pricey. After a time, the tulips contracted a non-fatal virus known as mosaic, which didn't kill the tulip population but altered them causing "flames" of color to appear upon the petals. The color patterns came in a wide variety, increasing the rarity of an already unique flower. Thus, tulips, which were already selling at a premium, began to rise in price according to how their virus alterations were valued, or desired. Everyone began to deal in bulbs, essentially speculating on the tulip market.    The true bulb buyers began to fill up inventories for the growing season, depleting the supply further and increasing scarcity and demand. Soon, prices were rising so fast and high that people were trading their land, life savings, and anything else they could liquidate to get more tulip bulbs.    The prices were not an accurate reflection of the value of a tulip bulb. As it happens in many speculative bubbles, some prudent people decided to sell and crystallize their profits. A domino effect of progressively lower and lower prices took place as everyone tried to sell while not many were buying. The price began to dive, causing people to panic and sell regardless of losses.     Dealers refused to honor contracts and people began to realize they traded their homes for a piece of greenery; panic and pandemonium were prevalent throughout the land. The government attempted to step in and halt the crash by offering to honor contracts at 10% of the face value, but then the market plunged even lower, making such restitution impossible. No one emerged unscathed from the crash. Even the people who had locked in their profit by getting out early suffered under the following depression.|`|AA10242125	Everyone wanted the newest tulips.

IIsByPj6aa	You shouldn't stick around paying for something you're not interested in, but at the same time if the acting thing doesn't work out, you sort of need a backup plan, wouldn't you agree?  I'd say stay in school, explore your options, take acting-related electives, maybe change your major, and make sure you have a fallback career in case you can't get into the acting business.  That's what I'm doing anyway. xP|`|hIhDvVtZaa	The reason that there are so many hopefuls in Los Angeles is because they spend their high school and college years dreaming instead of doing, so when they go to Hollywood, no one will cast them because they don't have any experience. Since many of those people never finished college, they have nothing to fall back on. I don't suggest that you drop out of college, as it can also be useful in your acting career. When it comes time to decide your major and minors, minor in theater or film. Until then, take some singing and acting classes at a local studio and try to get involved in some community theater. That way, if you do decide that Hollywood is where you need to be, you'll be ready for anything that gets thrown at you.

Philosophy is the rational investigation of the truths and principals of being, knowledge, or conduct. Basically it's what scientists think of us being here and living, what we do and why we do it, how we know what we do, and why/how we conduct ourselves in different ways around different people.    2. Why is philosophy important? Without the study of philosophy, we may actually end up knowing nothing about why we think/say/do what we do or feel how we feel.    3. Have you read something about philosophy before? What? Why? I read about it because you asked me about it. I opened up the dictionary and read the definition.

NYU37jfGaa	In 'Goddesses, Whores, Wives and Slaves' Sarah B. Pomeroy writes:    'The momentum of social change in the Hellenistic world combined with Roman elements to produce the emancipated, but respected, upper class woman.  The Roman matron of the late Republic must be viwed against the background of shrewd and politically powerful Hellenistic princesses, expanding cultural opportunities for women, the search for sexual fulfiillment in the context of a declining birthrate, and the individual assertiveness characteristic of the Hellenistic period.  The rest of th epicture is Roman; enormous wealth, aristocratic indulgence and display, pragmatism permitting women to exercise leadership during the absence of men on military and governemtn missions of long duration: and, as a final element, a past preceding the influence of the Greeks - a heritage so idealized byt eh Romans that historical events were scarcely distinguishable from legends, and the legends of the founding of Rome and the early Republic were emploiyed in the late Republic for moral instruction and propoganda.  The result was that wealthy aristocratic women who played high politics and presided over literary salons were nevertheless expected to be able to spin and weave as though they were living in the days when Rome was young.  These social myths set up a tension between the ideal and the real Roman matron, and were responsible for the praise awarded a woman like Cornelia, who lived in the second century BC.    The weakness and light-mindedness of the female sex were the underlying principes of Roman legal theory that mandated all women to be under the custody of males.  In childhood, a daughter fell under the sawy of the eldest male ascendant in the fmaily, the pater familias.  Male offspring of any age were also subject to the authority of the pater familias, but as adults they were automatically emancipated upon his death.  Among females, however, the only automatic legal exemption from the power of the pater familias was among those who became Vestal Virgins, a cultic role reserved for the very few.    By the late Republic, tutelage over women was a burden to the men acting as guardinas, but only a slight disability to women.  The virtous Cornelia managed a large household and is not reported to have consulted a male guardian even i nher decision to turn down a proposal of marriage.  Similarly, a century later, much is said about the financial transactions of Tererntia, Cicero's wife, but nothing about her guardian.    The legislation of Augustus provided a way for women to free themselves of the formal supervision by male guardians.  According to the "right of three or four children" a freeborn woman who bore three chidlren, and a freedwoman who bore four children were exempt from guardianship.    The right of three children aws not a response to demands from liberated women yearning to free themselves from male domination, nor did it act as much of an incentive.  The women of Roman society who had wanted to be free of the influence of guardinas had managed to do so before the reign of Augustus, and without the tedious preliminary of having three children.'

Also, Blood and Chocolate by Annette Kurtis Clause is a really good book.|`|nMdCdhPTaa	Honestly, I'm a teenage girl and I don't understand how they could like it.

Throwing around the words 'Adonis' and 'Greek God' don't make a character good looking. It just shows lazy writing.

N5iOaM8Caa	Playing with braces is aided greatly by using a trumpet mouthpiece that has a "cushioned" rim. The wider/flatter rim helps to spread mouthpiece pressure on the lips out over a greater area, which gives trumpet players with braces or thin lips more comfort while playing.     The lips will gradually adjust to the braces. Try to play as softly as possible, and using minimal mouthpiece pressure. Start with long tones and scales. Only play as high as you can play comfortably. Add flexibility exercises once the lips are responding "normally". With the long tones, you can begin to add volume... starting softly, crescendo to a comfortable loud volume.     Both Schilke and Yamaha, which are widely available, offer a  4 rim which is wider and flatter.     There is a company that offers a mouthpiece that is specifically designed for players with braces. Here is a review and link:      BP Trumpet MouthpieceTM    BP Trumpet Mouthpiece    The only trumpet mouthpiece designed for players who wear braces. Made by mouthpiece maker Greg Black, the new BP Mouthpiece takes away the frustration of playing with braces.    Reduce cut lips, improve sound and range! The BP Mouthpiece has a comfortable cushion rim and a v-cup to reduce back pressure.  "I wanted to let you what a difference the BP mouthpiece made for one of my students who has braces. Previously, his tone quality, range, and endurance was poor. He is now able to play with a typical trumpet tone quality for at least 30 minutes and his now hitting a high F when he could not even reach a high C. The change is shocking. His mom thought somebody else was playing his trumpet when he first tried it out and could not believe the immediate improvement. This young man's eyes are now bright with the excitement of being able to play well! Thank you!" -Ruth Petersen     http://www.zajamusic.com/mouthpiece.htm    Best of luck to you!|`|NsFfTYNpaa	lots of chapstick
JEb2Kqd4aa	November Rain by Guns And Roses.|`|kTXm7zbYaa	What songs do you like?  Almost any song could make a good music video.  I suggest you pick out at least 5 songs you really like.  Then look at the lyrics and see if any story ideas come to you.  Keep in mind how easy or difficult it would be to get the video you need to tell the story.  I suggest you keep it as easy as possible.         Lots of music videos fill in gaps in the story of video of the performers.  Is this for a high school tv production class?  I used to teach high school tv production and I saw lots of well made videos that had video of the kids who made the video lip synching to the song, so you do not necessarily have to have video of the actual musicians.          As a rule, country music songs are some of the best storytelling songs.         You can even make a good music video out of instrumental music. This way, you can tell any story you want since the lyrics will not be dictating the story.   So if you want, you can come up with a story that is easy to videotape and then find some instrumental music that is a good fit based on the tempo and tone of the song rather than the lyrics.         Strictly speaking, it is illegal to use anything but royalty free music in a video you produce unless you pay high licensing fees to the publisher.  Of course you can not do that.  Lots of people flaunt this rule and make the video using the music illegally and rarely does anything happen to them.  But occasionally they do get in trouble.         I have known of high school tv production programs getting sued by music companies.  Talk to your teacher.         If this issue bothers you, select a song that is in the public domain and do a video to that.  A public domain song would be one that is old and the copyright has expired.  You have to be careful with that too as the performance can be copyrighted even if the song itself is not.         If you want some royalty free music, try musicbakery.com.  They charge about 30 bucks for an instrumental song.  there are tons of places where you can buy royalty free music and even a few places where you can get them for free.         You might also think about making your own song with a program like garage band.         Even if you are not a musician, you could make a funny music video of you and your friends performing.  Even if you sound terrible, the point is video making.         Sing "Happy Birthday" and edit together photographs of yourself from baby to today.         I hope this gives you ideas.

01j0XPf4aa	What you charge is up to you. How much is the piece worth to you? How many hours did you put into it? Don't sell yourself short but be negotiable. Yes, you should put together a contract for this. The terms should state that the artwork is your creation, what rights you give them (what the artwork can be used for and for how long), and what you'll be paid according to the terms. This protects you so you get paid and credited for your work as well keeps them from using the artwork for anything not covered in the contract without your consent. For example, if they start using your work for t-shirts, posters, or over 10,000 CDs, you'd want some form of compensation, right?     There's lots of Graphic Artwork sample agreements you can google to get an idea of what needs to be included. When using a contract template, be sure to erase anything that doesn't apply to this situation and be sure to add in any details that you want to be clear about. A contract will help protect you/your work and will explain to the client their rights of use. Remember, if a dispute ever occurs between two parties, the written and signed agreement always wins the case. You don't want it too wordy but make sure it includes every detail that's important to you.|`|0e4fea790f4ea59363811798798d53a0aa	Find yourself an entertainment lawyer for advice.

Franklin Roosevelt was, as far as I know, the first president to employ professional writers to help prepare his speeches, something every president since has done. The primary reason was that most politicians, then as now, were trained as lawyers and as such trained to speak to a live audience. Speaking on radio, and later, on television, requires a different style of composition and delivery.

Also, I would tr to build up the tention of the finger on trigger as much as possible so that when it actually does get pulled, the audience has one of those GASP! moments.  Another idea of how to add details would be to talk about the characters family first, and then bring it back to her, like her mom was at work, sister at gymnastics ... meanwhile  their daughter/sister are is at home.... obviously, that idea could be spiced up quite a bit, but it is an idea.

This is borne out by the fact that the first slave market in the US, in Newport, Rhode Island, 1762, was in a town founded by slaveowners from Barbados.  Slavery would have expanded beyond this small market, as a supply of cheap labour (indentured servants - people who paid for their passage with several years of work) decreased.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_...|`|OmSJR5UFaa	Your question is a bit vague and somewhat hard to figure out.      There is no one single person who comes to mind who established slavery in the United States.  When the U.S. was founded, all of the major European powers had slaves in their colonial outposts.  The British brought them here, as did the French and the Spanish in the areas they occupied.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	The origins of slavery in the colonial United States are complex and there are several theories that have been proposed to explain the trade.Hence to pin point any one person , as you seek, is not possible.       Indentured servitude    Some historians, notably Edmund Morgan, have suggested that indentured servitude provided a model for slavery in 17th-century Virginia. In theory, indentured servants sold their labor voluntarily for a period of years (typically four to seven), after which they would be freed with "freedom dues" of cash, clothing, tools, and/or land. In practice, indentured servitude could be like slavery and was often a violent system; some Englishmen and Englishwomen (felons and those who were kidnapped) were compelled to become indentured servants, and in the early 17th century, many indentured servants did not live long enough to be freed. The principal significance of indentured servitude, Morgan argues, is that it accustomed 17th century Virginia planters to use physical violence (including beating and rape) to compel workers to work. This set a precedent for the violence of African chattel slavery, which the British colonies first adopted on a large scale in the 1660s and 1670s.     Slavery amongst Native American tribes    Another view on early colonial slavery is that of historian Alan Gallay. His book on the Native American slave trade describes the flourishing trade during the 1600s in Virginia, South Carolina, and elsewhere in America. Indigenous tribes had practiced a form of slavery since prehistoric times, sometimes for the purpose of ritualized torture and sacrifice, and sometimes for assimilating other tribes.[1] The way in which the American Indians treated war captives was witnessed and eventually emulated by European colonists, especially the practice of scalping.    This view is considered inaccurate by many modern historians because of the nature of Native American slavery. In North America, among the indigenous people, slavery was more a 'rite of passage' or system of assimilating outside individuals into groups rather than a property or ownership right. Richard White, in 'The Middle Ground' gives a clear explanation of the complex social relationships between American Indian groups and the early empires, including 'slave' culture and scalping.[2]    Another valuable explanation of the use of African slaves as opposed to Native Americans comes from an unlikely source. Ulrich Phillips argues that black people made better slaves for several reasons, and were therefore the best answer to the labor shortage in the New World. American Indian slaves were familiar with the environment, and would often successfully escape into the wilderness. Black slaves had much more difficulty surviving in the different climate once they escaped, the awareness of which may have acted as a psychological barrier to such attempts. Also, early colonial America depended heavily on the sugar trade, which lead to malaria, a disease the Africans were far less susceptible to than native slaves. Black people also easily stood out. Phillips also suggested that there was something inherently valuable for slavery in the African race in America. These racist beliefs have long been abandoned, but some historians still value his economic arguments which suggest that the choice was made more for efficiency.[3]     The first African slaves     Slave market, built in 1762, in Newport, Rhode Island, now home to the Museum of Newport HistoryUntil the early 1700s, African slaves were difficult to acquire in the colonies that became the United States, as most were sold in the West Indies. One of the first major establishments of African slavery in these colonies occurred with the founding of Charles Town and South Carolina in 1670. The colony was founded mainly by planters from the overpopulated sugar island colony of Barbados, who brought relatively large numbers of African slaves from that island. For several decades it was still difficult to acquire African slaves north of the Caribbean. To meet labor needs, colonists had practiced Indian slavery for some time. The Carolinians transformed the Indian slave trade during the late 1600s and early 1700s by treating slaves as a trade commodity to be exported, mainly to the West Indies. Alan Gallay estimates that between 1670 and 1715, between 24,000 and 51,000 Indian slaves were exported from South Carolina  much more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period.[4]    The first African slaves arrived in present day United States as part of the San Miguel de Gualdape colony (most likely located in the Winyah Bay area of present-day South Carolina), founded by Spanish explorer Lucas Vsquez de Aylln in 1526. The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans. De'Aylln and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic, and the col|`|kdSuwt8paa	Discovered Africans?    I hope you aren't a history major!!

But hell blame it on Christopher Columbus!|`|5llBXFF4aa	Slavery has been a part of human civilization for as long as there has been civilization as we know it.  The African slave trade was no different - there was a group of technologically-deficient people who were conquered and taken by a technologically stronger group.  That they were black was incidental to the slaver traders, and only slightly important to the slaveowners, who used racism to justify their acts.  MOST slaves throughout civilization were not black, and it was common for white men to enslave white men and black men to enslave black men.  In the USA the irony is that it wasn't racism that caused slavery - it was more that slavery caused greater racism as the slave powers had to use "justification" to greater pressure to end the practice.

07df3b441539a986ec562c2786da8473aa	Actually, the Matrix wasn't fake images the brain made up, it was signals to the brain that were interpreted just the same as signals from the body's sense organs. Your 5 senses are based on receptors that pick up changes external to your body. Eyes sense light, ears sense pressure waves, touch sensors sense pressure/motion, nose and tongue sense chemicals. The sense organs transmit what they pick up to the brain via electrical nerve signals to various areas of the brain where they are interpreted and processed to give us our "view" of the world. Reality is whatever your brain makes it out to be. Like Morpheus said, "Your mind makes it real".    If the Matrix were able to insert coordinated signals directly into the brain's sensory interpretation areas while overriding the signals from the body's sense organs, the person would not sense the "real" world. In Neo's case, once the Matrix signals were removed and the senses from the body's sensory organs were then used, the Matrix reality would be replaced with "real" reality. If the Matrix signals differed slightly from "real" signals, it could be pretty disorienting during the changeover.    As for the "death in the matrix - death in the real world" concept, death can occur if the body ceases to function effectively due to injury or such. But the body can go into shock from severe pain and this could kill. If the Matrix inserts sensations of extreme pain or overrides feedback signals to stop breathing or heart function, death would ensue. If the body was killed and the Matrix still inserted signals that all was well, they person would just blackout due to "real" death but never sense death happening.|`|CLB32006aa	He was taken out of the illusion by Morpheus via the red pill.

Even beauty and truth would be divorced from survival hope if they were not attributes of a personal God, a loving Father.  Is hope--the grandeur of trust--desirable? Then human existence must constantly be confronted with insecurities and recurrent uncertainties.    Mortal man earns even his status as an ascension candidate by his own faith and hope.
