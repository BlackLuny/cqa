IKzeeod2aa	^ Grammar Fail ^|`|458c0204f46933e0da57c8da9b2f1ba4aa	I think that in many cases, not all, boys can be more of a handful than girls.  Girls can be, not all, easier to reason with.  Some parents may throw up their hands faster when it comes to their rowdy, hard to control boys.  Therefore, they may seem to have higher expectations for their girls.  As I said this is not true in every case...some girls can be hard to handle.  If you talk to alot of moms though many will say that girls are easier to raise than boys.|`|mbgBFjKOaa	Yes, because boys can't get pregnant.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	Nope, I am strict with many things with both boys and my daughter.  Somethings I am more lax on.|`|sxecXFgraa	No.  To the first poster, you are correct that boys can't get pregnant, but they can get more than one girl pregnant at a time.  A parent needs to be just as strict with sex for boys as they are with girls, unless you're teaching your son it's OK to not take care of his responsibilities.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I try to treat all of my children the same but it is true I am more strict on my girls because they can get pregnant and have the pregnancy symptoms and well my boys can also make a girl pregnant but I won't have to go through the whole morning sickness and everything with them ......<br>   wow now that I typed that it seems really backwards|`|HQPwwntfaa	My brother has always gotten away with more than I have. He can cuss, go hang out with people my parents don't know..It makes me so mad. Like they let him go meet someone he met on myspace. They would never let me do that even if I had my own personal bodyguard.|`|su37vnIXaa	In my house its the opposite cuz I have 3 brothers so my parents felt bad for me|`|AunZaJOEaa	Lol the person above me is right.
z6IekuwSaa	Make sure that you NEVER deal out punishments. If she does something wrong, discuss it with her father and have him deal it out. Or course unless it's something like her running out in traffic or something like that. I think you'll prolly be a good step mom, especially since you care enough to even go out and get advice|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I'm going to be in the same situation you are in. Only difference is that the ex lives in a different state and the kids will be with us the majority of the time (school year with us, summers with their mom).|`|z5EDtgtyaa	I'm not a step mom but I have had 2 and I know what I didn't like and did like about each of them. you already know you don't want her to be reckless, but at the same time you want her to love and respect you since she is so young you have plenty of time to win her over, but remember she has a mother ( unless she is dead) you have to respect her mother's place in her life, she's higher than you even if you are married to her father, there is nothing worse than a stepmother that over steps their boundaries, but you know this because you have had step mother's before. one of my step mother's would get upset when I didn't call her mom, to me that was to much because I have a mother, she tried to get my dad to discipline me for it, she said I was being disrespectful, when clearly I wasn't. you can try being the voice of reason, you always want to be the neutral one especially when the parents are fighting over how to handle their teen, and what I mean is try to see both sides, don't just side with your husband because he is your husband. and take yourself out of an argument between the two if you feel you need to. and if you notice that she is troubled as she gets older talk to her and don't judge her. if she asks you to keep something secret unless her life is endanger, keep it a secret. I know this is a lot and it may sound a little crazy but that's just my opinion. I hope it helps some.|`|NGfiUo12aa	Alot of the advice you've received is very good.  I have been on both ends of the situation, step-mom and mom struggling with her children being a part of someone else's family.  <br>  <br>  It is good to have a good solid set of house rules that the other parent knows about, go through them so that everyone knows them clearly.  <br>  <br>  Make the form of punishment for breaking the house rules  very clear with both families, and the order (warning, timeout, loss of priveleges, etc.).  <br>  <br>  Don't mess with drop-off and pick-up times, maybe even allow her a little more free time if she needs it (thats how my childrens step-mom got in my good graces, she could see how worn out I was and offered her help (though it took me a while to break down and accept the help).<br>  <br>  Have things fun that you do with the step-children, I cook with one of the older children, and we have painting sessions (nothing serious I buy a craft project like wooden cutouts or blank masks and we paint them).<br>  <br>  And last but not least, remember that all things improve with time.  I hated my kids going to spend time with another family, but it slowly got better and now I even watch their kids once in a while.  (I KNOW, crazy huh?)<br>  <br>  You will do just fine.. and its an experience like no other ;-)|`|2k8NmkENaa	im in ur boat girl and its teeter tottering too.<br>  <br>  my bf has a 5 yr old who hates me only because her mother tells her not to like me and to tell me she hates me and to not let me kiss her dad or have him call me babe she has made this little girl a mini her which is hard to be around. We hardly ever get to see her and so when he does get to see her i have to disapear and get lost so he can spend time with her its really hard to see her have that kind of power over our relationship but its all good i feel like she is only doing all this because she doesnt want us to be a happy family with her daughter.<br>  <br>  I never discipline her i leave that to my bf but he doesnt do a good job. <br>  <br>  i let her come around i dont try to hard or even kiss her butt. i will watch tv until she comes to me and wants to play. I introduced her into cooking mac n cheese which she loves so we have that little bond. whenever she can be around me she wants to cook and only wants me to help her which melts my heart.<br>  <br>  I never ever hold it against her but the mother is a huge problem.<br>  <br>    I dont try to buy her affection or make her feel she is not important. i try to have her favorites when she comes and visits. <br>  <br>  <br>   I have plenty of pictures of her around my house and she loves that !|`|bVkIEpyGaa	Based on my personal experience, these tips are what I would give to a new step parent:<br>  <br>  If possible, get to meet the biological mother and clear the air. Tell her that you both have your step child's best interests at heart and you would prefer her support. <br>  <br>  Set your own rules in your own house. Do not enter ANY arguments with your stepchildren about them. They are your rules, and if they want to come to your house they need to respect them. Your partner needs to back you up on this.<br>  <br>  Make sure that your partner does the parenting. It easier for him to leave the nasty stuff to you, such as discipline, enforcing rules, punishments, making sure they do their homework etc. This is his attempt at making himself the favourite parent, while ensuring that his kids are well behaved. DO NOT get into this habit, as you will soon have earned yourself the title of evil stepmother. While you are entitled to enforce your rules when you are are in sole care of the children, your main role is to support both the children and your partner.<br>  <br>  NEVER put the other parent down in front of your stepchildren. They will defend their natural parent every time. Like wise, NEVER argue about the stepchildren in front of them. Dad will ALWAYS put his children before you (and he will most likely put his ex before you too) which will give your stepchildren more power in the hate campaign against 'this evil stepmother'! <br>  <br>  Let your partner handle any disputes with his ex, as long as they don't directly concern you. ie: which school he/she goes to<br>  <br>  If you have any issues, set aside some calm time with your partner to share your views and concerns and to work out a solution. Promise that you will hear each other out without interrupting. Arguing will get you nowhere fast.<br>  <br>  If you are able, come to a fair arrangement with bio mom over when you will have the stepchildren and how long for. While some degree of flexibility will be needed, due to things such as emergencies and holidays, make it clear that any changes will need to be in the best interests of the child, and not in the best interests of the parent. For example, one of you cannot insist on being the 'main' carer, and expect to make all the important decisions, yet dump the child like a ton of bricks when a cheap holiday comes up, and then expect to have the child handed back to them the minute they get back from their hols. (Currently dealing with that one!)<br>  <br>  Finally, let the small stuff go. Life is just too short!
dnG7fhnbaa	I'm afraid I can't tell you about personal experience but I can say that worrying wont help you or the baby...just wait till next week and see how it goes, good luck. x|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	I have not had this personally but I have read about plenty on another forum that have went through this. A lot of the times its just that your baby is taking its sweet time developing. A girl in one of the forums I am part of went in at 6 weeks and didnt see anything at all. She thought the worst was happening. The doctor asked her to come back a week later to check via u/s to double check. Even though she had given up complete hope. She went. Only to find a 7 week fetus, nice and healthy just as it should be. Its very very possible that this could be the case for you.<br>  Also if you have an odd shaped uterus, or if its tilted or in a heart shape, it can make it difficult for the u/s to be accurate. TRY not to worry, even though thats easier said then done. Good luck at your next u/s, I hope for nothing but good news!|`|VEEbzc4jaa	Theres no sac visible coz its sooooo small and the lining of ur womb is rather thick so it must have been virtually imposible for him to see anything.<br>  <br>  Im surprised there doing an internal scan so early in the pregnancy.

tK7XacH7aa	Well for starters make a schedule of the day. No matter how much you don't like it make a schedule of what you have to do. This will help get you in the norm. You go to school which is like a schedule and I'm sure you do some activities so you just have to try and make time. Make a calendar and put everything that you have to do in it. You have to realize that every single person in life has a schedule and if it wasn't for the schedule they wouldn't be able to keep themselves in order. They go to school, they have after school activities, then they have a job and then they have homework time. Even professionals, and whatever you want to be when you grow up have to have schedules otherwise they wouldn't have enough time in a day to do what they want. <br>  As for that job, try and find something that you like to do. Do you like to cook? Maybe try working at a restaurant. Do you like working with people? Try customer service of some sort or interacting thing. Find out why you didn't like that supermarket job so you know what you don't like and also think of something in the supermarket that you would rather do. Keep searching.<br>  Just learn to keep a schedule and keep a calendar and write down everything that you have to do. Schedule's are how people are able to make it through their daily life and without them, they'd be lost. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, if not, contact me.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	lol i thought about the car thing. <br>  <br>  damn you sound alot like me. hit me up sometime.   :)
JsqMSU9Haa	find out why - maybe there's a reason.  at 4, you should have a conversation with him.  if he just misses you, give him a rubber band or something to wear to 'hold' for you.  plan something after school like cooking together, ice cream - something he can look forward to.  but i really suggest finding out whats up with him - i push my 4 year old for answer sometimes, but that's necessary - you have to get to the bottom of things.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	has he been going to all along? or is this a new setting? how often does he go? does he have to go? a lot of info missing here. i would say that there could be a reason he doesn't want to go. but i don't know enough details - or he might just not want to be separated from you. but he seems a little old for that. <br>  unless of course he sees your reaction or somehow is gaining something by acting like this. when he screams and cries do you stay longer and coddle him? (coddle him and stay longer before he screams so that you aren't reinforcing the screaming)<br>  if you can stay with him a little longer before you leave him - like 20 minutes and ween yourself from him. <br>  but i would ask some questions of the director because really he seems a bit old to have this reaction.|`|kmGW34unaa	u beat them until they pass out and then they wont remember it was u who beat them. or u could just drug them|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Are you somewhere where preschool has just started? Or has this been ongoing since the fall?<br>  <br>  It's normal for them to cry somewhat. I know for the first week my son did (he was 2 going on 3). The teachers were very helpful in distracting him and encouraging him to do things to get his mind off of it. And it also helped when I just left without saying anything instead of lingering and making it worse. Now he's so busy he couldn't care less - it's more like, "Mom who?" LOL<br>  <br>  If this has been an ongoing thing, though, maybe you should take your child out. Ask them questions and try to figure out if there's something specifically bothering them - maybe certain people, things frighten him, etc. Maybe switch to another school that he feels more comfortable with or just forgo the experience and keep him home, with the outside stimulation of friends and playgroups to get him more socialized, as well as building up time to leave him with familiar people so he can be used to you not being there.

Q6AmysKNaa	There's this product called "Mentholatum," it's typically used for severely dry lips. I've been using it for a long time. Put it on especially before you go to bed, it should help you out a lot. You should be able to find it in any drug store or supermarket in the pharmacy section.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	I've been having the same problem.  I use a product called Lip Apeel. It's a great exfoliate for your lips!  You can purchase it online at www.beauticontrol.com.  It's about $20 but it last forever!  It comes with a great lips balm too!|`|46K4FtE0aa	Try Carmex available from boots chemist, it is available in a small pot or a stick, it is marvelous for dry lips andi have also found it brilliant for any lip problems including stopping cold sores drying out.|`|lCs16a6kaa	try scrubbing them with a mix of olive oil and some sugar.|`|eBgxZmqVaa	I had the same problem. All I drink is water, but my lips were still chapped and peeling. Try either Burt's Bees moisturizing lip balm with honey and Vitamin E or Palmer's Cocoa Butter lip moisturizer. They work for me.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	This happened to me as well and my nutritionist told me that it can be a symptom of vitamin B2/Riboflavin deficiency. With my OB's approval I started taking an extra B vitamin supplement and the problem actually went away. So you might want to look into that. Otherwise, you can use a soft toothbrush to gently exfoliate your lips, make sure you use a wet toothbrush, to get rid of the dead skin. Then use a lip balm. My favorite is Burt's Bees. :]|`|zxyMf6cJaa	I have the same problem and I am almost 15 weeks pregnant. Talking to your doctor is a must do.<br>  Besides, I think an increase in your water intake (I take a few sips every couple of hours at night too) and using lip balms several times a day will surely help. I use Burts bees one. Sometimes, I apply lots of it before I go to bed and gently exfoliate my lips the next morning. These things are doing me good. Hope this helps.
Jo2DfRzaaa	i doubt it.  my 3 year old already does it.  she  started when she was two.  she looked at me and said - i'm getting sooooo big!  yea i know.  :-(<br>  <br>  alas thats the way its supposed to be i think.  we are supposed to want to get bigger and be older.  there is always so much to look forward to - riding a bike, going to school, doing long division (i swear it was something i wanted to do when i saw a girl who was older than me doing it), going to the mall by yourself, learning to drive, voting, buying ciggs (just cuz your 18 and can), legally able to drink, having kids, getting married, and then wishing everyone would stop growing up.  <br>  you know my mood was getting better until this question.  shoulda stayed off yahoo.  ;-)<br>  <br>  <br>  i'm just teasing you.  im actually am in a better mood.  playtime w/the kids will do it for me.  that and asking questions about toilets....<br>  <br>  <br>  possibly but i think its ingrained too especially when they get in middle school.  thats when it was the worst for me.  before that i could care less really, i was happy at the age i was.  once middle school hit then you were so close to being "old enough" to do so much.  hmmm maybe we could get like shrinking devices and as soon as they get too old, we shrink them back down to little kids and let them relieve their awesome kiddyhood?  that could work right?|`|WPI0Z47saa	I think this is something that all kids try to do naturally. But all you can do is to make their childhoods as fun and fulfilling as possible and create nice memories for them.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I told my kids that they are not allowed to get any bigger, but they still do.|`|a34e6b0d3635b089c5a7917078fe691eaa	this is a very hard thing to do. Just let them be themselves and have them do things other kids their age are doing.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Sadly I doubt it. I had (and still do have) incredible parents, but when I was a kid all I wanted to do was grow up faster, like most kids and once I reached my teens I rebelled HARD. I went from being a 16 year old brat who steals her parents car to sneak into clubs to a married, pregnant, completely different person! Funny how things change so fast. And now sometimes I wish I could just be 8 years old again haha.<br>  I hate that my kids are growing up so fast, but I don't think there's anything we can do to change it.<br>  <br>  I think terms like "only grown ups can ____"  do make kids wish they were older-but what parent doesn't say that occasionally. As long as kids are slowly given more freedom as they grow up I don't think it's going to do any harm. <br>  <br>  I think you just have to play it by ear, and set your guidelines and boundaries early on. Be firm, but willing to negotiate on some things. From speaking to you it seems like you are a fantastic mom so i'm sure your kids will be fine! <br>  :)|`|2ZrUko5uaa	Kids always see some kid who's older and has their own 'cool style' .<br>  My daughter is 12 on the internet she saw a picture of a scene kid , she started to print out pictures then begging me for their haircuts , so i let her get a MILD scene cut and some highlights , next she wants her nose pierced after 7 weeks i just gave in , she's coming out of it <br>  since i refused to get her scene clothes shes giving up now cause she knows thats not really her .<br>  <br>  The point is you cant talk them out of growing up or stop them growing up because there just trying to find themselves .<br>  <br>  Other case can be there just so excited to be older they start acting like their older as in the famous one "I cant wait till im 16 so i can drive OMG!" -about most teenagers .|`|1VdgsZPoaa	Just make sure you let them stay a kid as long as you can.  Keep those little childhood joys alive.  Keep Santa a part of the magic of Christmas, paint with your fingers with them, bake cookies and laugh.  Try to avoid saying things like "why don't you just grow up?!" and whatnot.  My parents said that a lot to me.<br>  <br>  All kids want to grow up before they should but it's just a normal part of childhood I think.  Kids can still be kids and do things like have chores and whatnot.  If they want to.  Just don't force it on them before they ask.|`|WOHc22Xiaa	I think we all do that. I wish a was young again. Well younger because im only 21 but I have a child and a step child at home and I work full time so my child hood is gone...lol. Just tell them that they will regret it like you do. Tell them to enjoy their childhood and that it's over before they know it. good luck.|`|15qceXaOaa	if thats how they want to enjoy their childhood let them enjoy it. and if they are not happy on Earth God will accept them into His kingdom if you are Christian.|`|bXRuC1ASaa	Sean is staying little because I asked him to.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Keep up outdoor activities, I was never in a hurry to "grow up" because my dad was always taking us camping, fishing, horseback riding, to amusement parks, to the movies, ect... I didn't have many friends to influence me and I didn't care to have friends because I had fun with my family. My dad I believe is the prime reason I turned out so good I believe, and my mom says so too. Of coarse I messed up sometimes, but it was never with stupid things like going out with boys, doing drugs, or dressing like a skank or causing havoc with "friends". You need to find plenty of things to do to keep their mind off grown up things. People I see are forgetting that these days. People are lazy and give their kids cell phones and games and cars... No one earns it anymore. Kid's these days are so selfish and unprepared, disrespectful because parents are getting lazy and throwing the kids off to something else to take care of them. ALL this stuff my dad did for us, we had to earn the right to go and have fun fishing, camping ect... We have to clean the house for example to the point of him dragging his finger across the surface and seeing no dust. Clean his car, rake the lawn, take out the garbage things like that. Never argue back or we get nothing, and even for doing something we never expect anything. And be grateful if and when we got anything. No matter what he got us, if it was a single lollipop in the store, we'd always thank him for it, and still do. That is true respect. I don't see many kids thanking their parents for anything.<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck with that, I hope they're not the past the point of respecting you to get their chores done, that's the first step.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Put a lot of emphasis on the joys of childhood and teach children about the responsibilities of being an adult.  Let them see you in action, paying the bills, cooking, and cleaning house.
bmoCpcdraa	they both sound like middle names,,,,|`|Elxuvon8aa	I like leonaRD BETTER ORLeonardo|`|AA12370001	Being honest.  I hate both of them.|`|hSTNMnFPaa	Leopold isn't my favorite, but I do adore Leo. Usually I'm not a fan of nicknames as first names, but there's something substantial about Leo (maybe because it's also a zodiac sign) that makes it okay to use as a full name. Though, I do love Leonardo as well, with the nickname Leo.<br>  <br>  As for Ginevra, I may be in the minority here, but I actually like it. I might be a bit biased, though, as I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and Ginevra is Ginny Weasley's full name, lol. Whatever the reason, I actually like it.<br>  <br>  Georgina isn't the best, though. I much prefer Georgiana- much prettier and less heard-of.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!<br>  ? Qǖ???|`|UjFfdquLaa	I hate the name Leopold i'm really sorry it's just an opinion.<br>  Ginevra is ok but i like Genevra better.|`|XHZtwfuIaa	I like Leopold but not so big a fan of Ginevra. What about Guinivere?|`|igvUbqkyaa	I do LOVE the nickname Leo, but I agree it is a bit short for a full first name! I don't really care for Leopold though - but it is really hard because I don't love Leonard or Leonardo either - but I would go with Leonardo.<br>  <br>  And I don't care for Ginevra, sorry. I much prefer Genevieve or something of the like.|`|AOkucu5haa	I like Leopold; it has character unlike "trendy" (trashy, rather) names like Caden. <br>  <br>  I'm not too fond of Ginerva; Georgina, however, I do like.|`|EaDkj1JJaa	I don't like Leopold, but Leo is cute. And I'm not fond of Georgina. But in the end, it's up to you!<br>  Good luck!|`|AA11876718	I'd just like to comment on GEORGINA! It's ugly ugly uglyyy I hate it! I can't imagine how people choose this name! ugly! sry! lol|`|edLbogmYaa	Leopold.. It's not to bad but not great either I guess it's an OK name. But Ginevra sounds really bad I don't like it at all.|`|BCIfeHAqaa	I don't like Leo at all, i reallyy dont like Leopold.<br>  And i hate all the girl's names you've said.|`|s3cvyLYtaa	i don't really like any|`|H9o3jdm2aa	No I don't like it.|`|poxYuNRGaa	That's a powerful name, but If I were a child, I'd prefer not to have that particular name...maybe Leonardo though. Young kids, and even some adults, wouldn't understand the boldness of that name, and you wouldn't want your son coming home crying everyday because the kids at school tease him about his name being Leopold. Think of his future.|`|vvXVGMYeaa	either one...i believe they are going to suffer if they have the names you like.<br>  for a boy, leonardo is cool, so you can shorten it to leo, for a girl, I don't know, but ginevra? isnt it a weird name? I dont even know how to pronounce it.|`|PF1sEcujaa	I don't really care for Leopold, Leo is cute though. Ginevra I don't really like either, but I really like Ginny. Georgina is really cute (Georgie for short).
AA11210211	My son is only 3 1/2,he still has a few accidents mainly if his bladder gets overfull and doesn't make it to the potty in time.He has been pull up free at night for 4 days now with NO accidents so I am keeping my fingers crosses!! He has only been potty trained since January of this year so..|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	It's very normal. He probably gets distracted and forgets he has to use the bathroom. <br>  <br>  Most of my girls stopped regularly having accidents at 3 - 3 1/2, and had the every now and then for a few years after that. My 4 year old's haven't had an accident in, well, I can't tell you how long! <br>  Knock on wood!|`|rt2V9gLUaa	My daughter was three.  Her mother and I had bought a new bed and set it up.

vue9NOhYaa	If she's malnourished, yes, she could be pale and have dull skin.<br>  <br>  How much weight has she gained? How much does she eat?   Have you spoken to the doctor?  Is she content otherwise?|`|SLph9RX6aa	i was always worried about my son looking to pale, as long as she is well and gaining weight i'm sure she is fine, take her out for fresh air, lots of long walks that will get some colour in her cheeks.<br>  baby's that age only eat when they are hungry, they have growth spurts and hungry days and some days that they are not bothered about eating lots.
hSJnaysiaa	My question to you is: Did she use you as a personal reference or a professional reference?<br>  <br>  If she used you as a personal reference then its ok to comment on her mental status, but if she used you as a professional/employer reference (for watching your son) then you CANNOT comment on her mental status, that is considered slander I believe. <br>  <br>  Since she is going to be working in a daycare I think that you should answer their questions honestly, but don't provide more info than they ask for. If they ask about her mental status then go ahead and comment, but I wouldn't just bring it up out of nowhere. It is a daycare, she will be monitored, not like she is going to be the only adult there all the time, ya know? If anything goes wrong, someone else will be there.<br>  <br>  I don't personally think its your place to bring up the negatives. Especially if she is now being medicated and is trying to turn her life around. Yes, she will be working with kids, but she WILL NOT be alone with the kids, there is a difference. And I'm sure their hiring process includes a background check of sorts which probably won't bring up her mental status, but its not your place to bring it up.<br>  <br>  As a professional reference you just need to answer questions that directly relate to her caring for your child. They will probably ask things like: Did she show up on time? Was she a positive force in your childs life? Did she keep active with your child? What kind of activities did they do? That kind of thing. They probably won't ask: Is she a mental case? And its not your place to bring it up.<br>  <br>  The rules are different for personal references, but again, I don't think its your place to bring anything like this up. She is being medicated and trying to work things out, and what better way than to find a job that she loves and has proven to be good at.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	i would give them a recommendation based on the job that is asking for your reference. if she watched your child, and was excellent at it, there is no reason why you shouldn't tell them that. if a company calls and wants your opinion for a job that deals with things you know she hasn't handled very well before, say that very thing. <br>  if she was good with your child, then tell them that. you can also tell them, that it was a laid back situation where she was at your home, and no time clockes were punched, so you honestly don't know how she is on promptness or attendence. (which you really don't, just from her words right?)<br>  if she will be working at a facility, with a bunch of kids, there will also be a bunch of other teachers that she will be in front of. if you don't think she will hurt the children, then their is no reason why you can't tell them the truth about how she was with your kids. good luck!<br>  i guess i should say, if you feel the nessecity to tell them about her disorder/ that she has had problems recently, i guess you can. but actually if it has never affected the way she took care of your son, then that is her personal life. she probably has always had a "condition" but her life has been under control to the point that she could handle it. now it isn't, so if you think that you should tell them, if it would make you feel better, go ahead. but i honestly don't think its really is your place to do that. mabey tell her, that she should tell them??|`|UYfqzCoMaa	That is a toughie. She may be great with kids but just has a harder time around adults so she would probably be great around the kids. But you never know with personality disorders. I am not sure what I would do in that kind of situation. Is she even on the medication that she should be on?|`|JsqMSU9Haa	because she'd be workign with kids, you have a responsbility to tell the truth.  i'd just tell them she loves kids, but she's going through some issues now that may or may not be suitable for a daycare environment.  ask yourself this - would you let her watch your son now? if the answer is no, you know what to do.  make sure they keep your comments confidential.
SEzIkGNiaa	I think thats a great reason why she wants to be homeschooled.  If she feels she is better off homeschooled, let her do it!|`|vwuMTm7Saa	If her only reasoning is to finish school early, there may be other options, like night school.  This can accelerate the process and let her graduate at least a year early.  Her fullest potential may not be reached in home school because discussing and debating with your peers is a valuable part of school that will be lost in home school.  This can really help prepare her for college.  I personally finished school early and I wish that I would have stayed and just experienced it all.  While she may be dying to finish so she can grow up faster, the journey is ultimately more important than the destination.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	I think it's good enough but make sure she does it and if she doesn't send her back to school because like the other girl above i did the same thing I didn't want to be in high school bu ti really did want my diploma homeschooling was harder than i thought so i stopped =[ i wish i would have never left high school. good luck|`|tbeO3Lataa	Yes, it's a great, very mature answer! However, you need to talk it over more with her. Figure out things like...<br>  <br>  What will she do to socialize?<br>  <br>  Will she be homeschooled by you, or online?<br>  <br>  What will she do if she needs help in a subject?<br>  <br>  How will this impact her future career plans?<br>  <br>  All are excellent things to think about.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i used the homeschooling to my mom just so i could get out of high school. i did want to complete my diploma through either online classes or night school... its been like 2 years and i am still trying to find time to get a GED.|`|eXbGpOAfaa	There might be something going on at school, maybe she does'nt "fit in" or someones bulllying her, ask her if everythings ok...|`|Jo8nlGVsaa	Okay I'm a high school student, and it sucks! Everyone is rude and the education is terrible. My brother is home schooled and he and my mom both love it. He gets his work done in like 3 hours if that, and if he or my mom want a day off in the middle of a week, then thats fine they take time off to get other things done, and do 6 hours the next day. If I had the opportunity I would defiantly go back and be home schooled. I would be in college by now if i had done that. Year round schooling is a great idea, because as I said she can pretty much go at her own pace.|`|z6IekuwSaa	If she wants to that is a great reason. If you are worried about her social development, she can still join club sports teams and they have tons of social networking things for home schooled children too. Besides, public school is taught by a bunch of crazy liberals.|`|m9g6tBqiaa	She is probably also uncomfortable in school.  Try it for a year, for her sake!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well dont listen to her she could keep going to school i think is beter for her
zHy0z7sAaa	Babies tend to go through a growth spurt around 3-4 months and that could be why she is sleeping so much.Also around 3 months was when I noticed my daughter start getting on her own little schedule.Now she sleeps anywhere from 8-11 hours a night, wakes up for a bottle and is back asleep in less than an hour.It sounds totally normal and yes, its safe.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	It's certainly safe, though I could see how it could be a little annoying.  She slept 8 1/2 hours - that's great for a 3 month old.  Then, after being awake for 2 hours, she needed a nap.  This is also normal.<br>  <br>  They need a lot of sleep.  You can try to tweak it more to your convenience, but I wouldn't worry about it.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I agree with the other mommy who mentioned the growth spurt.  I swear my son was awake for maybe 3 hours total the entire day in the 3-5 month age range.  I was worried, but he ate, gained weight and grew so I just let him sleep.  I even opened his bedroom door so that he'd wake if he heard noises, but he was out like a light.  I just took advantage and napped and took care of everything else I needed to around the house. :)|`|lD0VcAlpaa	She's just adjusting and trying different schedules. Babies at her age do this, it's perfectly normal and healthy. To get her on a better schedule, you can try waking her up and an early hour, feeding her and then doing activity/playtime for 2-3 hours then putting her down for a nap. Do this for every meal and hopefully she may start to adjust to an easier bedtime.|`|B1OUPWxXaa	I think that's probably normal: Everybody has their own sleep patterns.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Shes normal...My son is now 3yrs but when he was a baby..We stayed up late every night (I am bad, I know) so even now he isn't ready for bed until like 11..and will usually sleep till 10....

tx8OTfFUaa	Our son was 3 months when we moved him into his own room and into his crib (from his bassinet) at the same time.  The earlier comment about a shirt or something with your scent will be most helpful!  He transitioned very well.  In fact, we had no problems at all.  He slept through the night before and has ever since.  <br>  <br>  Don't be concerned about your 4 wk old sleeping on you during the day.  Our son did not start to take naps (laying down alone) until he was close to 2 months old.  I know it's sometimes a pain (I could not get one thing done) but he will get the hang of it.  My friend just got one of those slings and she said it was the best investment she ever made.  Her daughter was born in Dec 08.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if it will be the same for you, but my son is usually awake anywhere from 1-1.5 hrs until he was about 6 months old, then he would be awake anywhere from 2-3.5hrs, then nap for 2-2.5 hours twice a day.  It fluxuated between 2 and 3 naps for awhile, but usually runs as it is listed above.  If you know he's fed and his diaper is fine, then he must be tired.  I  noticed that our son rubs his ears when he gets tired....<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jhPlVj0oaa	In the UK, the guidance suggests that you should keep baby in the parents bedroom until they are at least 6 months, although I kept both of mine in till they were 9 months old.  I had a swinging cradle which my boys grew out of when they were about 4 months old and I just moved the cot (crib) into it's place at that point.  If you are breast feeding, it makes sense to keep baby close because you may have to get up 2 or 3 times during the night anyway.  <br>  <br>  I had a pram in the lounge where I put my boys to sleep, either that or you could get one of these supportive bouncy chairs for him to sleep in.  Another alternative is to wear your baby in a sling that way you can get on and do the things you want to do while baby sleeps / feeds / whatever.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lD0VcAlpaa	It's a personal decision. I couldn't stand to move our son out of our room until my husband purchased an Angelcare Monitoring System, it is a board that lies under the crib mattress and measures their breathing. Too fast/too slow/not at all for 20 seconds and it sounds an alarm. It gave us the peace of mind to finally give him a little independence and develop a healthy time apart from each other. As for the putting him down with him crying, you cannot spoil a 4 week old by picking him up, etc, like some may tell you. However, it's beneficial for you to get him to that very drowsy stage and then try putting him down. If it doesn't work at first, try getting him completely asleep then putting him down with your body still very close until he's completely on the mattress--then shushing him gently back to sleep if he wakes up when you put him down.|`|EsGrIscFaa	My daughter was in our room til she was about 12 weeks old. This was mainly to make night feeding that little bit less stressful. To make the transition smoother we put things from her cradle into her cot that she would recognise, such as her mobile. <br>  As for napping during the day, you will have to work out his pattern for sleeping. Does he normally fall asleep after a morning feed? Is it always around 10am? Try keeping a little diary of it - boring but helpful - then you can see if a pattern evolves and then use that to plan times when you can put him into his cot and let him fall asleep there.|`|1S7uXsInaa	Around 6 weeks I started moving my kids out of our room, slowly (a little further out each night) until they were in their own room then I moved them into their crib.|`|MvMMIxjIaa	really is up to u when u want to move him out, lol my eldest now 15 slept with us till he was 5, my baby i moved into her own room at 4/5 months old she loved her sleep and i felt we were disturbing her. Are u breast feeding? is that why he naps in your arms? I found the best thing to do is feed him if breast feeding wind him if he falls asleep at the nipple as he will wake for more feed then, if not give him his bottle wind him, feed again, keep going until he is full, make sure his nappy is dry and place him in the crib. He may create but try to be patient, reassure him ure still there maybe place ure scent in the crib nothing he can pull over his face. Youre making a rod for ure own back if u let him get use to sleeping in your arms as there will be a time when u may not be there to get him to sleep. also let ure husband try put him in the crib. good luck.|`|pXSKSS3daa	That is totally your call on when to move him out. We moved our son into his room at 4 months. By this time he was consistently sleeping through the night and we hadn't had any health related issues with him to where I needed him by me at night. Some parents like to have their babies in with them longer, though, for reasons such as SIDS and breastfeeding. Do what you feel comfortable with doing.<br>  <br>  As far as napping goes, are you swaddling him? If not I would try that. He still has a startle reflex that probably "gets him" when you lay him down. I also rocked my son until he was in a DEEP sleep before putting him down for a nap, but he also napped in his swing until he was 7 months old.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Whenever you want to. Some babies sleep in their own rooms from birth. Some sleep with their mothers for a year or more. <br>  <br>  I kept baby in a bassinet by our bed until she was down to one night feed (5 weeks) and then moved her down the hall. <br>  <br>  Napping is a different issue.  He obviously still needs to be near you, so I'd try a sling so he can nap in your arms.  When you feel you need to transition him to his crib, do it slowly and gently, and wait until he's DEEPLY asleep before putting him down. He may also sleep better if there is a shirt or bra with your scent in the crib with him.|`|rjVALevtaa	Both of my boys stayed in the bassinet in our room until they were 3 months old. Most cradles or bassinets have a 15 lb weight limit and most babies reach this by their 3rd month. Also, both of my boys were sleeping a lot more at night by that age.<br>  <br>  Definitely try to get him to nap in his crib. The transition from bassinet or cradle to crib usually isn't easy. Expect him to wake up more than usual the first couple of nights. <br>  <br>  Hope I was helpful.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	I moved my son into his crib when he was 10 weeks old...as far as sleeping in your arms..I tired putting Aaron in a swing and that helped with his naps. I also would just rock him and then lay him down. Somehow they know the min their bottoms hit the mattress and they wake up..The swing helped me alot|`|AA11109728	I moved my daughter out of my room when she was outgrowing the bassinet and just started trying to roll over.  From there she went into the crib in her own room, and luckily it was a smooth transition with no problems.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	For my baby, the transition came so smoothly. I did not want to kick her out of our bedroom but she grew out of the bassinet at 3 month so I had to move her to her room. I think at 3 month, she didn't really know what was happening around her. In the day time, she napped downstairs in a bassinet where I was most of the day. Around 4 month, her ears became so sensitive that even a little sound woke her up so I had to let her sleep in her room for her naps too. <br>  <br>  So Around 4 month, My little baby girl was moved to her room for all her sleep. <br>  <br>  I know babies are all different but I think there's no hurry for you to move your baby to his room already. If he's not ready & needs you more then, take your time. Try to go to your baby's room a lot with your baby to get use to the room to get him use to the environment. He'll adjust soon.
SEzIkGNiaa	No.  I think its great that you give chores to your children.  It is their house too, and a family needs to work together.  Here are my chores:<br>  <br>  -Load Dishwasher<br>  -Wipe Counters<br>  -Clean Bathroom once a week<br>  -Keep room clean<br>  -Vaccum room<br>  -General Tidyup<br>  -Vaccum main floor<br>  <br>  I also help my mother with her daycare and help take care of my 6 younger siblings, meal preperations, and bathing...<br>  <br>  I am 16 and homeschooled btw.|`|aab8fee4bb00a3a37d38643f4e296de7aa	Of cores teens are going to say that's not "fair" because their immature and short sighted. This is why they aren't adults.<br>  <br>  Even if you had 2 kids and had plenty of time to get everything done around the house. It's really important that kids grow up understating what it takes to keep a house hold run and how to properly do these very important daily tasks.<br>  <br>  You'ree doing them a huge favor, it would be a major shock if they never had to do these things until they are on their own.<br>  <br>  Other thought: I would say ideally you should start chores nice and young ( 3 or 4) their load should peak in Jr high or early high-school at which point depending on their school load and extra curricular activities you may want to pull back some. Life is pretty complicated for a highschooler taking college prep classes and involved in sports, job and/or other clubs and activities.|`|en9Xk0h2aa	It's good if you have the kids help you out. Otherwise they become spoilt, lazy little brats. And spoilt, lazy little brats grow into arrogant and selfish adults. You're teaching them that you have to work in life, and they won't have everything done for them.<br>  <br>  It's not as if you have them on the streets selling their bodies so you can buy food lol.|`|wuwUHukwaa	Wow. <br>  12 kids.<br>  Hard work I am sure.<br>  Seems like the 17 year old is getting the short end of the stick though.<br>  I am sure the 14 year old could vacuum or do a wash.<br>  It doesn't seem fair she has so much to do.<br>  Wanna watch she doesn't move out soon as she hits 18.|`|paHjJrrdaa	I'm really sorry. I answered your other questin thinking you had 5 kids and thought this was okay.<br>  <br>  I now reconsider that it is not. With 12 other kids in the house I'm sure simple chores become much harder as things get even more messy.  <br>  <br>  You and only you should be responsible for the bathing of the younger kids, plain and simple! They are your babies not theirs.<br>  <br>  I think maybe the 7 and 8 year old could do some chores to take some slack off of the older 3.  At that age they can do something like: Sort laundry, Put dishes in the sink, and they can even do some dusting (but not around valuable breakables).  I think if you did at least this it would help the other 3 feel more like they are just helping out and not trying to be a mom themselves.<br>  <br>  All in all I do think you are doing your best and I commend you on your efforts to organize your household. I'm sure it is not easy with 12 kids. Just be sure you let them be KIDS first and foremost.  This should be the happiest time of their lives and they shouldn't be babysitting all the time.  Good luck, you have your hands full.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	there is nothing wrong with making the kids do chores. you and your husband can't do it by yourselves. and they are your kids so don't ask them tell them they are going to be helping around the house. those chores seem fine, you can even make a chart so you can switch it up so they aren't doing the same chores every day. my daughter is 3 1/2 and she helps me make her bed, and helps me with cooking dinner, she put the dishes in the dish washer when I hand them to her, nothing heavy of course. and she also helps me put her laundry away and helps fold towels. the earlier you start the better.|`|EzTh60uIaa	the 12 and 14 year olds chores seem fine to me but i think the 17year old has a tougher time. i would drop the washing and especially ironing. i do appreciate life must be hectic with 12 kids (i have 2 boys). but you did make that choice and it really is your responsibility to take full care of the younger ones. maybe just ask the 17year old to do his or her own ironing would be more acceptable.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	No.  My kids are 9, 11 and 16.  The 9 year old cleans his rom, takes out he trash, loads the dishwasher at night, vacuums and cleans his bathroom.  The 9 and 11 year old clean their rooms, do laundry, clean their bathroom, unload the dishwasher, dust the family room and help cook supper.<br>  <br>  Chores will not hurt a kid.|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	No, I think it's fine to expect them to do chores.  I gave up work to look afetr my kids and everyone assumes you sit on your bum all day!  I did less when I worked part time.  <br>  <br>  They need to learn that their is not a cleaning fairy that does everything, she is you!!|`|4YIUxSlYaa	What do you do?  Seems like they are doing all the work.  I know you have 12 children, but if you couldn't cope you shouldn't have.|`|15qceXaOaa	no way! they should do them if they r the oldest and have 11 other siblings!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	From my answer to your other question:<br>  <br>  Gosh, what do YOU do?<br>  <br>  I think that the 12 year old's chores are fine.<br>  <br>  I think that the 14 year old can handle all but folding the laundry (a chore <I> despise and would not make a child do) and I do not think either sister should have to wash the younger siblings.<br>  <br>  I think that the 17 year old should not have to iron, and should not have to dust and as I said above, should not have to wash the younger siblings.<br>  <br>  I have a friend with ten children-she manages. The older children help, but are not slaves. I think you are requiring too much of your older children. I believe in helping out, but they need to be children as well. They did not choose to have such a large family, you did.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	No, of course you are not wrong - part of your job as a parent is to teach your children to Work.<br>  <br>  I'm not talking about kids doing everything, but even small children can do simple jobs, as they get older they can assume more responsibility in the household and by the time they are 16, 17 & 18 they are perfectly capable of running a home.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the 12 and 8 year olds could start doing a little of what the others currently do - maybe shuffle the jobs around a little to lighten the load off the 17 year old.<br>  <br>  My eldest daughter was 11 when her Dad was diagnosed with Cancer and I had to take care of him, when he died she was 13 and by then she was capable of planning and preparing a full meal, doing laundry, grocery shopping, house cleaning - everything I needed to keep the place running.<br>  <br>  What you are giving your kids is the knowledge that they are an important part of your family - make sure you thank and praise them for what they do, but you are raising responsible adults.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	First of all I want to praise you for being such a great mom. Let no one degrade your ability to be a mother. The amount of work and time you commit to your children is remarkable and I think this chore arrangement is fine. Your family has to understand that it takes a team to get everything done and everyone has to help out. I don't think it's unreasonable and teaches your children responsibility. Besides you should at least get a half hour to yourself everyday to recharge and do something you enjoy. You deserve it to yourself and to your family so that you can be at your best even if it means other members of the family need to pick up some extra chores.|`|EaDkj1JJaa	Absolutely not! It teaches them responsibility and respect. No way should you have to do everything on your own! Everyone should help out around the house-whether you have 2 kids or 12!|`|5cf23b88864f1dc1a748c6e4a47dc564aa	i would say that you are wrong to ask them to do it. you should tell them to do it in exchange for their allowance.|`|AA11571186	i think it's great that the kids help out around the house, however i think the 17 year old does far too much! the poor girl is at the time of her life when she is discovering who she is.  how is she suppose to do this, when from what you have said she spends most of her life doing chores.  it is not fair that she has to do the ironing for 14 people, plus doing all the other things you have listed.<br>  <br>   they never asked to be part of such a big family, and if they are happy to help out that's fantastic, but if the eldest doesn't get time to be herself then she will rebel and move out, and resent you for it.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	i think you are doing your job as a mom by having your kids do chores. parents who allow their kids to not have chores and be lazy are setting their kids up for failure. the kids need to learn how to do these things, and it's better to start at a young age and get them in the habit than to try and teach them later.<br>  and with that many children, i'd expect the oldest ones to be doing way more.<br>  <br>  when my husband was 10 and his older sister was 12, they would pick up the twin babies from daycare, clean the entire house, and make dinner. everyday. after dinner they did their homework and took care of the younger kids while his mom and dad cleaned up after dinner.<br>  these chores taught them discipline<br>  <br>  chores aren't going to hurt them.<br>  <br>  and to everyone's comments about the 17 yr old doing too much, i don't think that's very much at all.<br>  large families help each other.<br>  <br>  i understand, as a mom of two, the kids make a ton of mess and things need to be cleaned up all the time. it gets exhausting, and is impossible to do with that many children if you don't have anybody's help. by the time you have one thing cleaned up, there would be three more new messes to clean.
YuVSDBkzaa	You say it's not your place to say anything because she isn't your daughter, but I think you're wrong. Why wouldn't you have the right to say something if a person hurts you? If I were in your shoes, I would tell her that what she did wasn't nice and she cannot treat you like that because biting is wrong and hurts people. Also, if it's your house (or you and your bf's house) you have a right to set ground rules. Jumping on your furniture is rude and something you wouldn't tolerate anyone else doing, so she needs to respect your things and your house rules, etc. If your bf will not step up and teach her BASIC respect, then I don't see why you can't do the minimum. If he has a problem with this and still refuses to do anything about her behavior, then you may want to reconsider your relationship...imagine how he will be when you two decide to have children of your own.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	You know, the important thing here is not that she's going to turn into a brat (which she apparently already is). The important thing here is that he allows his daughter to blatantly disrespect you - and even thinks it's cute. This means that for the rest of the time you are together, this little girl will do whatever she wants to you and he will NEVER punish her for it. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, he's not the right man for you. Plain and simple. You see, he doesn't think enough of you to protect you from his daughter. And I'm betting if you bring this to him, even nicely, he will think you're trying to drive a wedge between him and his daughter. Go ahead and bring it up nicely, see what he says. If his response is *anything* along the lines of "well she's my daughter and I don't want to hurt her..."  or "I don't get to see her very much so..." etc - RUN. Run like the wind.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	She already is a brat. This would be a deal breaker for me. I would not want to marry a man or have children with one that did not take his job as a father seriously.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Tell him straight out that her behavior is unacceptable.  Let him know if he does not reprimand her and teach her right from wrong then you will not be around when he is with her.  Stand your ground!!|`|JsqMSU9Haa	if youre serious abuot this guy - speak up.  better to get things out in the open now, it wont be easier later.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	Ok. My perspective. Im a mother, her father and I are separated. He has a girlfriend (whom i dislike for many reason, not to get into that now) and I am not seeing anyone.<br>  <br>  My ex lets my daughter get away with murder when he has her too. Not to the extent that your bf does (that I know of). <br>  <br>  If I found out that my daughter bit his girlfriend and he didn't say anything I would be livid. Even though I don't care for his girlfriend, she has a place in his home and in my daughters life, she needs to step in or she will get walked all over.<br>  <br>  I dated a guy and that was my biggest complaint. He never stepped up and helped me with discipline. I understand he might not have been comfortable doing it, but even for him to say, what did your mom say? Would have helped me.<br>  <br>  Talk to your boyfriend, next time I would say something. The child's mother will appreciate it in the long run.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Do not wait for him to reprimand her for biting you - let her know that it is not acceptable behaviour, and tell that if she ever does it again you will put her in her room, then tell HIM the same thing, you will not allow her to bite you or anyone else.<br>  <br>  Frankly though, you are not going to change him, or her, so unless you want to live like this until she is 21, either get used to it, or move on to someone else who doesn't have children, because what you see is what you get!|`|eMCCQD8Faa	you have to tell him that its not ok for her to act like that, If he lets her treat HIM like that it's up to hi but he CANT let her act like that with other people like yourself.....Its rude and one day she can hurt someone, if he keeps letting her get away with things she will get used to it and tell him it will cause a problem in school|`|SRsFkNBBaa	im sorry, but if my boyfriends daughter would have bit me on the face, and then he would have laughed,i would have got up and walked out and never looked back.he should have taken care of it right there out of respect for you.  that is the biggest form of disrespect in my book. someone letting their children act like an animal to another adult-<br>  she should have gotten her *** whooped, she is way too old for biting.<br>  if you stay with him, be prepared for much worse.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	One of these days she will do that to someone else and they arent going to be so nice. i would straight out tell him look I'm not trying to tell you what to do with her but I dont like the fact that she can hurt me and its ok. If she is doing this now she will be worse when she is older.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	If my boyfriends child ever bit me in the face, I would have had something to say to him and the kid. You don't and shouldn't put up with that. If you want a future with this guy you are going to have to have a serious talk with him.|`|7aCH91ISaa	I'm sorry, but if he thinks it is funny to see you hurt, you need a new boyfriend.|`|J3REXSldaa	Tell him that she needs to get her act together|`|qUH9q4Kcaa	I'm really not trying to be rude, but I want to be honest about what I think. If this is the sort of man and father he is, why do you want to be with him? Is this the man you someday want to raise a family with? <br>  <br>  However, if you want to discuss it with him, just be honest. "I enjoy seeing your daughter, and I know that you love her and I think it's great how you spend time with her, but I really don't enjoy it when your daughter hits and bites me, or when she acts such-and-such way at my house . . . Would you please talk to her about it the next time she does it?"<br>  <br>  If he gets offended or ignores your feelings, then I say it's a clue that you need to be looking for a different man.

Cn9OCETqaa	I'm in your boat. im 16 too, and i think im pregnant as well. the best advice i have to offer is get a test, though you might get tired of hearing it. but not having your period since then and if you have a regular cycle, thats usually a dead giveaway. get a bunch of cheap dollar store tests, they actually work well from what i hear. and as for what to do, that totally depends on what your life is like. if you think you can handle keeping the baby, then you should stop partying. believe me girl, i know its hard! im feinding for a cig as we speak, but if you are pregnant you GOT to stop. just listen to yourself and maybe confide in a close friend who knows your situation a little better, or even the guy who got you pregnant, and see if you get any support. abortion is always an option, depending on your views and your circumstances. just know that you arent alone!!|`|bsVyYuJKaa	baby girl you need to get things together! Not only is drinking and smoking not good for the baby but it's not god for you either! Getting pregnant means a lot of growing up in a little amount of time, you've got another life to take care of now and if you can't even take care of yourself it's not going to be an easy ride. Please stop drinking and smoking at least until you find out if you are pregnant or not. <br>  <br>  I would go to a local clinic that you know is safe, they will keep things confidential and wont judge you when you go in. If you are thinking about an abortion, try planned parenthood. Some clinics are pro life and will push you more towards adoption or keeping the baby. If you aren't ready for that, find a clinic that offers abortions and they wont pressure anything on you that you aren't prepared for.<br>  <br>  best of luck!!<br>  <br>  p.s. chewing gum helps break the smoking addiction, just pop a piece in your mouth each time you want a smoke.|`|LvbizUcwaa	get a pregnancy test and take is ASAP or find a free clinic and get a test done asap....and stop drinking and smoking till you now for sure!!!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	You better clean up your act as you're on the road to nowhere.

I hope you aren't pregnant, you are far from being mature enough to become a parent.|`|i8Ch743Laa	Um,TAKE A TEST!!!! Find out if you are,it's not right to KNOW you could be,and to keep up drinking like you're not. I don't know WHAT you smoke,but stop doing it.

I know that babies usually end up fine from it,but not always.|`|oGbHyZR8aa	The first thing you should do is stop smoking and drinking. Do you know what that does to your baby? If you plan on keeping it you could have to spend even more money than normal because your smoking and drinking caused the baby to have problems.<br>  <br>  Get a pregnancy test. You can go to WalMart, local drugstores, local Planned Parenthood, or even a wellness center at your school.<br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, you should talk to the father, and go somewhere to get educated on options (such as Planned Parenthood).|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you should not drink or smoke from now on.<br>  <br>  take a test to make sure you are or are not.<br>  <br>  if you are, go to the doctor asap.<br>  if you are not, consider taking birth control and using condoms.<br>  or not having sex until you are ready for the responsibility of being a mom.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	Stop drinking and try to stop smoking. take a test and if its positive tell your mum or dad or whoever you stay with. good luck.|`|lNqE8H8Paa	Take a test, quit doing what you are doing, and learn how to spell (speak correctly) or you will get no where.
1pbTmda6aa	the only thing different on me post baby (once the year was up - ha) was my hips and boobs.  I was small pre-baby and still small post baby and mine are 10 and 5.  It took me a little longer with my first to get back my shape than it did with my 2nd.  After having my 2nd, it was like the month after and everyone was freaking out...that's what happens when you have 2 to deal with - lol.<br>  <br>  I say, everyone is different.  Your body only gets older and depending on your genes, you may or may not get your shape back.  Not to brag, but my belly is flat as it was pre-baby, but I'm lucky because of my family genetics.<br>  <br>  Look at how your mother, aunts, grandmothers have done following their childbirth years and you will probably fall closely behind.  But, I'm sure you look good, especially if you think and feel so.|`|tx8OTfFUaa	Kudos to your energy!  From what I have been told (my son is 9 months old), your hips will remain slightly wider (bone structure) and your mid section will carry more weight.  C-sections make this worse as they cut through your stomach muscles and it takes quite a while for those muscles to come back!  Keep working and I bet you will look fantastic!|`|zATQaiwIaa	Let me just clear this up - your body will never look the same as it did before you had your baby - no matter what the stars look like!<br>  <br>  Some women actually will look healthier, but an overall average of women will never get that super flat stomach - they will come close, but it wont be the same, your hips will never quite be as small and so on......<br>  <br>  Your hormones will take a year to come to grips usually - give or take of course.  having a child is no small thing!

It wasn't long at all.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	1st one, daughter she is 12-i was in labor for 16 hours, no pain medicine, i was trying to be superwoman, then i had to get emergency c-section anyway. go figure<br>  2nd one, son-he's 8 now.-same thing i was in labor 10 hours, then emergency c-section<br>  my 3rd, 4 months old-PLANNED c-section.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	I have one biological son and I was only in labor for 4 and a half hours but I walked almost 4 miles a day when I was pregnant and they say either walking or rocking is the best way for the babies head to position right|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I was induced and labored for nearly 12 hours. When my cervix reached 9cm I stopped dilating, so I ended up having a c-section.|`|rFwGnZIJaa	I was in labor for 10 hrs. but I was lucky and only had 10 minutes of pushing. I heard some women have 2 hours of pushing.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Around six hours with all three of them. I almost had the second one in the car.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Yup.  I was in labor for 0 seconds cause i'm the dad :P
tbeO3Lataa	I hope you don't mind I am not a mother (LOL, I always feel bad about that when I answer questions in this section). However, I am a high school student with a heavy work load, and I am no stranger to lack of sleep, so I'll give you some of my tips.<br>  <br>  1. Rest when you can. When he falls asleep (if he naps during the day), fall asleep yourself, it's a rare opportunity. (Okay, so that one I learned from babysitting overnight, not high school).<br>  <br>  2. Sit down when you can. You don't have to sleep, just try to rest your body. However, on the other hand...<br>  <br>  3. Also exercise when you can. Put him in the stroller and go. Why? Because if you get active, you will start to feel more energetic (generally) about half way through the walk. Of course, don't quote me on this, it doesn't always work.<br>  <br>  4. Stay hydrated, and full. Lack of fluids or food will only increase your tiredness, so eat when you're hungry, and always have a bottle of water.<br>  <br>  5. Play some upbeat music, maybe something your son would enjoy (LOL, I used to love a children's artist named Raffi. "Banana phone..." Great, now I'll be singing that all day. Where was I? Oh yeah...). Playing music will create a more energetic mood.<br>  <br>  6. On that note, keep an energetic attitude, even if you, yourself, are completely run down.<br>  <br>  7. To help with the crankiness, it is helpful to learn some breathing techniques. It really is.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|n3PE2lvDaa	just make sure you are eating healthy. Lots of fruit, vegies and iron fulled red meat.  ANd plenty of water. Avoid sugar and fatty foods as they can make you feel more tired- when the sugar wears off.<br>  You could try berroca. Hope thats spelt right. those tablets you dissolve in water that contain vitamins and minerals that give you a boast. If you are breastfeeding double check with the pharmist that they are safe. I take berroca as my pharmist said they were ok to have when breastfeeding.<br>  Get outside once a day and walk. The fresh air and exercise will help you have more energy. <br>  Most importantly sleep when baby sleeps or at least rest. Dont be to worried about having a tidy house. And keep reminding yourself that it cant last forever!|`|9AUmp5jWaa	Make sure you put him in for naps.  A 6 month old should nap every 6 hours.  Put him down and you take a nap.  Get him into the routine and you will not be tired.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	To me, it's really been about pacing myself and accepting that this is The Year of Being Tired.  And that it won't last forever.|`|hFoYmSgqaa	i try to nap when my baby does or failing that i get my husband or sister or a friend to have him for a few hours. my little one is only 16 weeks old goes to bed 11pm gets up 530am sometimes 845am which is a total luxury. but routine is a good idea. i don't drink coffee makes me ratty with everyone so have found herbal teas have helped and a multivit with iron.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Sleep when your son sleeps....and find some sort of caffine that you like...I couldnt imagine the first years of my daughter's life without coffee....<br>  <br>  Also, dont be afraid to ask for help from friends and family. If you're feeling extra frazzled, just ASK! I'm sure you have plenty of people around you willing to help.|`|1S7uXsInaa	Nap when he naps and think to yourself that this will be over soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I remember how excited my husband and I were when my daughter was old enough to get up and watch cartoons by herself so we could get just an extra 1/2 hr of sleep in the morning. . .can;t wait till that time comes with my son.|`|X2I9Mu4Vaa	yoga does it for me .. and a lot of energy drinks .. im partial to a drink called tweak energy ... according to the label its 8 times more powerful than anything else on the market .. and it seems to be working cause i was up at 2am last night cleaning and back up this morning at 7 drinkin another one to start my day .. lol. but yoga does energize me when i dont have the money for a drink everyday|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Take naps when he does. I know that's hard to do because you need to fix dinner or do laundry but even if its only an hour; take that nap and you will be better. Also make sure you still take ur vitamins.|`|U5RObaBGaa	if he naps during the day just take a nap with him, the washing and house hold chores can wait, whats important is that you and your little one are healthy and happy xx|`|x3fQP9viaa	Tea, RedBull.  The food you eat really helps, fruits and veggies are energy boosters.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Caffeine. For the first couple months I would take those 5-hour energy shots which worked pretty well|`|SLph9RX6aa	nap in the day with him, get dad to mind baby so you can have a rest, ask for help, friends or family, tell them how shattered you are, can they mind him just for a couple of hours once in a while.<br>  if you can afford it a babysitter on occasion.<br>  5.30 -10 is along time for a baby to be awake maybe you could cut down on his naps during the day and stat his bed time routine a little earlier evey night|`|MvMMIxjIaa	sorry if this sounds silly but .....................get some fresh air, it works wonders.   Also u cant keep pushing ure self i found if i slept while the baby slept it helped a lot. Your baby will pick up on ure crankiness and it wont help him. If all comes to all get into bed & bring him with u helps bonding and its wonderful to awake and see ure beautiful child with u.  Dont worry about the housework it will all be there in 6 months.|`|Uh9wh1HWaa	I would get up and do like 10 minutes of cardio first thing after the bottle. That helped, a LOT.|`|VCCKfT3taa	Meditation. It isn't sleep, but it's darn near close. <br>  <br>  srsly.|`|G2auAv1Saa	I would put the face cleaner sea breeze on my face, something in it makes my eyes pop open. Then I like to exercise to keep myself going (sounds contradictory but it does work).|`|Fd4lITkvaa	The only thing that I have found to really help is to co-sleep. It allows me to wake up less fully and get back to sleep much faster. My son is almost 12 months old and up every 1-2hrs most night no matter where he sleeps or what I do, we have tried it all.
RT3Og4Oiaa	My story is almost exact to yours. The only difference was I stopped trying to breast feed after a month and Sarah loosing 2 lbs and not gaining any weight back.  <br>  We did the high calorie formula...3 scoops to 5 oz of water for about 2 months.(Per: Dr.)..by the time Sarah was 3 months old I think, she finally got back up to just birth weight. we had to go 2-3 times a week for weight checks.Because the DR was so worried that Sarah had some sort of medical issue. But really she just wasn't getting anything to eat.  It was so stressful. <br>  She was taking about 4 oz every 3 hrs. At 1st we went through a 32 oz can of Enfamil every week. Thats when we switched to Costco brand formula 2 cans for 20 bucks..couldn't beat that. <br>  I wish you luck, Im sure after you get her back up on her weight, they will tell you not to worry about the higher calorie formula and go back to regular formula feeding. <br>  <br>  It is very stressful, tiring and emotional, when you cannot for the life of you breast feed...I have been there. I dont care what what others say...they were not there, as I struggled all day and night...pumped as I had her on my breast..and to see only 1-2 oz come out from both breast total for the entire day and I pumped every hour, and breast fed every hour. Had her on my breasts for over an hour, and she was still hungry..I did this for the entire month...I felt so sad that I could not feed my child like I was suppose to ...but I am grateful that I had other options and they worked out just fine, after we got her started on formula, she finally slept cus she was content, she was happy cus she was full. And she started to get that lil baby belly that everyone talks about. She started to thrive. So I wish you all the best mommy, keep up the good work.|`|Q9qno7EVaa	My baby girl is 2 1/2 months now and she takes breastmilk in a bottle, we had problems attaching then complete refusal, she drinks about every 2.5 hours during the day and takes almost 4 ounces. But she usually sleeps for around 6 hours straight at night time and then feeds every 3 hours til she gets up for the day. So she's taking around 750mls a day around 24ounces in 24 hours. A rough guide on how much your LO should be having is to multiply her weight by 150mls then divide by how many bottles she takes (8 in 24 hours) e.g if she weighs 5kgs you do 5 x 150mls = 750mls (1 ounce is approx 30mls so around 25 ounces in 24 hours) so 25 / 8 = 3.125 ounces per feed. This is just a rough guide my baby doesn't take as much as she's suppose to but she's still putting on plenty of weight. Good luck I'm sure she'll be fine at least you can keep track of how much she is getting for now.|`|YEqQZgs5aa	Good for you for trying the breastfeeding, and also good for you for doing whats best for your baby - dont let anyone make any kind of comments about your decision!<br>  <br>  My lil one just turned 4 months, he is eating mostly ebm but has 1 bottle of formula per day.<br>  <br>  He eats about 4 oz every 3 hrs...  he is around 14 pds...<br>  <br>  They say:  The average baby takes 2 or 3 ounces of formula each day for every pound of body weight, up to a maximum of 32 ounces. A newborn weighing 7 pounds will take an average of 14-21 ounces of formula in a day. A 4-month-old weighing 14 pounds needs 28-32 ounces.<br>  <br>  SO it goes more by weight than age...|`|9kPPmazoaa	Every baby is different... but my daughter drinks 3-4 oz every 2 hours. I thought by now she would be drinking more than that, but nope.... As long as she is growing nicely & is healthy... I am happy :-)
pCbzhOrkaa	yes i ALWAYS! i used to love the name Charlotte until i met this really creepy, geeky girl. Then i didnt like Phoebe at all until i met my friend Phoebe who's amazing. So yea i do it all the time|`|EcdelIHtaa	yea kind of but not all the time..<br>  like Jackie.. i think all Jackie's are whores<br>  All the Jackies i've ever met were whores... even the "Jackie" from that 70's Show..<br>  So Whenever i hear that stupid name that is what it reminds me of|`|i3FgiLENaa	Yep, that's why I hate the name Elliot.<br>  People tend to do this a lot..|`|IPl3Yh1kaa	LOL, the only Andrea I know is just as you described. However, all the Jamie's I knew were a little mean, & not very pretty. So i guess it depends.<br>  <br>  People with wild names like Nicea, and Marisha seem to have similar personalities (and yes, I know a nicea and a Marisha if you can believe it)
Ccq8zEcnaa	yes, try to wear thin cotton clothing and underwear, and a bra without an underwire. And whenever you can sit around the house naked if it makes you happy! I find that wearing loose thin clothing helps, and only cotton so it doesn't itch. But at night I sleep with only a big oversized tee on, and I wish I could walk around like that all day.|`|65f9bf63277a3aad10cb477ed6f41708aa	I am the same way too!! I only wear stretch pants while I am outside of the house, and my husbands big basketball shorts in the house, with a tank top and sports bra. I feel like everything is so tight on my stomach and top. I wear jogging pants too alot, they have really cute ones at Victorias Secret. Just wear what makes you feel comfortable right now!! I sleep nudie buns at night too because I just hate the feel of anything on me!! Good Luck and congratulations!!|`|zSABr7praa	Bra's are the only thing driving me insane right now.  I had the cutest boobs, that I completely took for granted pre-pregnancy, haha!  Now they're gigantic, and look like a road map!  (Nice vision..lol).  I can't find any bra's that are comfortable, and i'm starting to get back aches :(  I'm naturally pretty petite.. so it's a big shock to have to start wearing bra's that i'm sure I could find at my grand mother's house.  I'd go bra-less if it didn't HURT!|`|6cwJi5kxaa	I FELT THE SAME WAY WHEN I WAS PREGO. I WORE SCRUBS FROM SUN UP TO SUN DOWN.|`|s4OtfZ7Gaa	haha, yes i'm the same way! i do everything i can to wear clothes i dont have to wear a bra with when i go out, and then if i do wear something with a bra, i make sure i'm not out long and can get home and take it off. clothes in general dont bother me, as long as they are very loose fitting pants (like pajama pants) and big baggy t-shirts. needless to say, my fiance hates that.|`|qImMwhUHaa	Well, I'm 36 weeks pregnant and I always wear my bra but other than that I would go around nude if it weren't so cold. I wear my husbands sweat pants and his t-shirts. I hate putting clothes and shoes on to go somewhere. I hope I can make myself get dressed after the baby comes.|`|IWBpfOXWaa	I felt the same way.  I hated wearing maternity clothes too, so I would shop at stores like Lane Bryant and Ashely Stewart to find comfortable clothes that I looked good in.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I was the same way when pregnant. Everything about my clothes bothered me, especially my bra. It only gets worse as you get bigger. After the baby is born you feel much better and you won't have time to feel uncomfortable.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Haha, yes! If I thought I could get away with it I'd probably just walk around naked. Clothes are uncomfortable, regular bras smoosh my ribs, and I get hot very easily.<br>  <br>  Funny story-- I'm 35 weeks and the other day my husband came home from work and I was wearing his boxer shorts, a sports bra, and had my t-shirt wrapped around my head keeping my hair out of my face because it was making me hot and uncomfortable. He thought it was pretty hysterical. I looked pretty ridiculous and trashy and huge but I just don't care anymore...lol.
9580a1e44dd3d2bae7d2f867611ab353aa	? I'm a stay at home mom too, and yes I feel drained at times. I feel like I clean something up and 5 minutes later its a mess again. Its kind of an endless cycle, but you have to take a break from it all sometimes. If your able too, get a babysitter get out or go out, have some personal time or adult time. If you can't, then try going to a kid friendly place (park or something) and  just playing, get the cleaning, bills, things to be done, out of your head, and just play with her. Kind of take a mini-break, it helps. Sounds like you have gotten stuck in a rut or a pattern, and just need to break that, or mix things up from time to time. good luck|`|mAJZFmIEaa	i am also a stay at home mum, by fiance gets home from work and asks what i have done all day.. i tell him well nothing, the house cleans itself and the laundry washes itself and the baby gets looked after aswell. I do the same thing day in and day out.. i'd give anything for proper adult conversation but i wouldn't change anything either because of all the things my daughter does to amaze me each and every day.|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	You have too much going on thats why. Don't worry about your house and just clean it whenever you have time for it. As for school you really should look into getting a sitter so you can study or do projects because its important to do well in college. As for the hyper part Idk just roll with it. It never hurts to see a dr either. Good luck.|`|eG53oROJaa	yes yes yes, i just asked a similar question in toddlers and preschool because i so do feel drained and impatient and guilty that i feel that way...and i think i may be suffering from some bipolar, like you mentioned chemical, i had been diagnosed with depression in my teens but i think mine may be back... it's good to knw there are otehrs out there feeling like me...|`|8sFBxf6oaa	i feel like that every day.  i have four children, the youngest being 2.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	I feel like that!! Im a stay at home mom too...We just bought our first house (which is a LOT bigger than the little apt we were in) and I often feel overwhelmed with taking care of my daughter and husband (who often works 12+ a day)  AND keeping my home in order. I rely a lot on my family. They often keep my daughter for a day or two, to give me a break, but its a temporary fix. I've thought about going to a doctor too, but I never have. It seems as if it'd be the best thing for both of us.<br>  <br>  I know I'm probably not helping much...I just thought you'd like to know that you're not alone...|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I would suggest just going to a General Practitioner or Family Doctor to start. Tell them of your symptoms. You never know if you could have a medical problem. I felt this way after my son was born, very frantic, anxious, spacey. I went to see a doctor for the insomnia issues I was having, and turns out I had Graves Disease. The doctor said that when you have a child it's hard to spot certain health issues because we just assume it's the stress of being a mother. <br>  <br>  So go get checked out. Just a regular family doctor will do to start with. When your health checks out fine, we can start looking for other reasons you feel this way. Good luck!|`|lGSUToFQaa	yes and mine is only 8 months old, luckily my hubby is off 4 then 3 days each week so i get breaks to clean the house and finish school and all, congrats on going back, i grad in may and at least your went back that's all that matters, i made an appointment at the salon for tomorrow to get my hair cut, it's sad i used to go to the spa every week and get pampered, now a bubble bath is pampering. you are not even close to being alone in this, it's normal, i have a bow flex and i can't even find time to work out on it daily, it's crazy, as soon as i get the baby taken care of here comes my 8 yr old and it starts all over again, never ending.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	being a stay at home mother is a lot and is very stressful. I was a stay at home mother for 5 years and then I had enough I had to get out into the real world again and make my own way. it actually worked out better for me to go to work and leave my son with my husband since he is on disability and has the time to stay at home. I enjoy my job and I LOVE the fact I am not on call 24/7 just on call for a few hours a day  LOL|`|12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	I'm not a mom but, am a college student.  Lots of my friends are mom's who have come back to school...so in that area you are not alone!  College in itself is enough to drain you!  My friends are always busy but, you just have to remember to take a little time for yourself.  Every month one of my friends sets aside time to go to the spa or get a little papering done to feel rejunivated.<br>  <br>  You're setting a great example for your daughter!  Good job!!|`|QveBSjFSaa	I started being an insomniac when my 2nd child was born.<br>  I get up anywhere between 12:30 a.m., and 2 a.m..<br>  This is my "me" time. Actually, it's not spent on "me", it's when I do uninterrupted chores, exercise, shower, pay bills, online class, etc.And that is what  can suggest to you, getting up a tad bit earlier (not as early as I do, admittedly, that's insane!), to get a jump start on your day.|`|x3fQP9viaa	Get some sunshine, it boosts your mood.  Eat foods that energize you, like nuts, berries, fruits.  Set your alarm 30 minutes earlier for some you time, sit and do nothing.
YQrKQ5PAaa	Well, it's a given my girlfriend and I are going to be together forever.

I'm sorry. :)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Try kicking the father in his ankles!!!  I'm kidding...nothing will keep them from coming but different lotions will help them fade.  Some women get them, some don't.

You have to be consistent or it won't work.|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	A large percentage of pregnant women get stretch marks on their stomach, and more than 75% of women develop stretch marks around the waist, stomach, upper legs, butt and breast during pregnancy. However, even though there are creams to help these stretch marks, pregnant women are advised against using them. These creams have a high vitamin A content, which can really affect a developing fetus.<br>  <br>  There are many ways you can help yourself avoid pregnancy stretch marks. Wear a good support bra to avoid stretch marks on your breasts. Use a body brush to massage the areas where you want to avoid getting stretch marks. The reason stretch marks appear during pregnancy is because of the rapid weight gain some women go through, therefore if you try to avoid gaining too much weight you may be able to avoid stretch marks altogether.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of pregnancy stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>

I stuck with more traditional names for my 3, a name may be cute on a little one, but he/she will grow up, and i'm sure it must be a nuisance to have to repeat your name or spell it out to everyone as an adult.|`|BlPJw4iAaa	chav and cheap!

We know a child's something special, we don't need to be reminded everytime we call her name|`|K9PziwJNaa	There is a young chinese girl at my work called cherish, it seemed a little strange at first but now I think its a lovely name|`|CrjozlCjaa	Makes me think of the group called Cherish the Ladies.<br>  <br>  Call her Lizzie.|`|9886899d6f135552d9c3c4f7e401043daa	Sorry it reminds me of Madonnas big hit.<br>  I think it also sounds chav-like.

Call her Cherish. X|`|zTLjmrKtaa	Awful.  It sounds like a slave name from the American deep south during the 1900's.<br>  <br>  What on earth made you think of that?|`|Y4dr9Wfmaa	no, dont, call her Esme
zAzZ3xcOaa	My moither told me when my son was a baby and refused to eat... that I also refused to eat when i was a baby... she went to the doctors... and the doctor said... when i got hungry... I would eat.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Kids this age can be very picky eaters or not see it as a priority. They would rather be playing. However, he may just have a virus, as the vomiting may be showing. If there is a problem the doctor will tell her. Our doctor always said that if we can get one good meal in our children a day, we were doing well.|`|r52rfBkeaa	Any change in their surroundings can cause babies to stop eating, or to not eat as much.  We moved across the country and my son refused the breast for a week.  He eventually got over it when he realized that the world wasn't coming to an end, but babies are really sensitive to this kind of thing.<br>  <br>  I think your SIL should consider the situation as if she had a new baby of her own to bring home to the 19 month old.  You know how they say to give the older child "special" attention so that they don't feel like the new kid is taking over their world?  I think the same thing applies here.  Although the baby isn't there 24/7, her son may think that this new kid is taking over his territory.  I think she should make a special time of day for just him where they can play one-on-one or do something that he likes to do.  Maybe let him choose what game to play one afternoon.
s2F6pK9Xaa	Um, wow. That really is a tough situation. I'm not gonna say that this will be the most ethical answer, but if I were you, I may think about NOT telling him. <br>  <br>  Is your boyfriend excited about this pregnancy? Does he have any suspicions that you have slept with anyone else? <br>  <br>  Think of what would happen if you did tell him. How do you think he would feel? how would he react?<br>  <br>  Then, what could happen if you did NOT tell him? Is there a way that he could find out? THEN how would he feel about it after you've led him to believe that this is his child?<br>  <br>  You need to weigh the repercussions of both. What does this relationship mean to you? Were the two of you talking marriage and babies in the future? Were you living together? Are you able to support the child?<br>  <br>  There is the chance that this IS his baby too! But your infidelity will still sting him. <br>  <br>  Let me make it clear that I do NOT think it is fair to him for you not to tell him if indeed you know that the baby isn't his. That's just not okay. <br>  <br>  I know a family that had something similar happen- the guy and girl were dating since they were 16 and 15 respectively...then they had a little breakup when they were around 23 and 22. She slept with one other guy, one time...but the timing was such that she knew when she found out that she was pregnant that it wasn't the ex-boyfriend's, it was the random guy's. The girl and the BF got back together (couldn't live without each other kinda thing) and she told him what she had done...'cause there was no way that it could have been his at that point, they had been broken up for several months. They did have a very hard time for a while, but he stayed with her, was there for the baby's birth, is listed on the birth certificate as her father, and remains just that to this day- 8 1/2 years later.<br>  <br>  The couple has been married now for 6 years, and have another little girl together too. They seem likt the perfect family! I mean, nobody would know this by meeting them today. Even once you got to know them, you would NEVER suspect! <br>  <br>  You have to do what you think is right. But understand that he will not take this news well.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rxjdovzyaa	First, have you been tested by your doctor for STD's?  If not you need to get this done right away - it can affect the health of both your baby and your boyfriend.  If you do have an STD, your boyfriend needs to be told and needs to get checked out right away.<br>  Are you going to have an amniocentisis done?  Because paternity testing can be done at the same time, and both you and your boyfriend will know before the baby is born.|`|NyWwCWBcaa	You need to tell him now, before he gets too attached to the child. Just in case it's not his. Let him know that you don't mind having a paternity test done once the child is born, and that you geniunely regret the mistake you made. He may leave you, but it's better than lying to him. Plus, he may be more willing to stay with you if you're honest about it now.|`|y2pErbI2aa	If you can, you should have a paternity test done first to make sure before you tell him the baby might not be his. However, you should still tell him about the time you cheated on him.<br>  <br>  You just have to tell him - it may be best to tell him on a day where you're both free and can talk about it. He's going to be devastated, and he's going to have trouble accepting it. He'll have trouble forgiving, and he will want to know what your reasons for cheating were.<br>  <br>  Just be honest, and if you guys have a strong relationship, you might make it through this|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Have you talked to this dude lately? Does he know your pregnant? If so is he telling you no way possible it could be his because he pulled out. I think it is your boyfriend's baby with the full load of sperm he gave you and knowing he did not pull one drop out. I know it only takes pre-*** to get someone pregnant,but with him knowing he was a random dude I think he might have been a little more careful then you think. Good-Luck!!!|`|DRb4Qlypaa	You either do and risk him breaking up with you or don't and live with it the rest of your life. I really think you should tell him, it could lead to so many problems later on if you don't.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	gosh i don't know.. all you can do is tell him.. and get a paternity test.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	maury|`|Cn9OCETqaa	Its really a tough situation. in my personal opinion, i really wouldnt be able to live with not knowing. i would wait, because you dont even know if your one night stand actually finished in you. wait, and get a dna test after the birth. you might end up relieved and he might be your bf's baby after all, in which case...it might not be the end of the world to not tell him, unless it still nags at you. right now though, you could potentially risk losing your bf's support if you tell him, and you dont want that happening while youre pregnant. id say wait until you know its even an issue.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Oh wow. Okay, honestly no matter how you tell him or what you say that's probably not going to go over very well, so I really don't think it matters how you do it. Good luck.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	There is no win on this one, there is no better way to say it. Either you tell him or you don't. There is no other way of finding out until you have the baby tested.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	That's a REALLY tough one. There's no easy way to tell him, your just going to have to say it or maybe write him a letter. Better do it soon because it'll be much harder on him the longer you wait. I'd be prepared to lose him because I doubt he'll get over this.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Go on Maury when baby is born|`|f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	Let Maury do it for you...|`|UdtzY5ciaa	MAURY TIME!
IOp3knBjaa	I actually just had a Mirena IUD (had it for the full 5 years) that was taken out in May of last year. I did actually get pregnant the first month after I was off of it, although I miscarried.  I became pregnant again in September, about 6 months after removal, but we actually weren't really "trying" just letting whatever happened happen..lol. So, I don't think it affects fertility at all. Best of luck to ya!!|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	My doc told me that they prefer a woman to wait and have 3 regular cycles before trying to become pregnant after IUD removal.|`|J3yUXKiyaa	You could get pregnant this very first month.  Good luck to you!|`|F12ekJ7Saa	My friend did. She got pregnant on the second month. You still could get pregnant the first month but everyone is different. I wish you the best and lots of *baby dust* for you :)|`|AA11903503	I did, I had it removed and 30 days later I had a positive pregnancy test. Good luck to you
G2auAv1Saa	Don't look at it as right or wrong neither of you were entirely one way or the other in my opinion.<br>  He threw the cup 3 times. After the first time he should have been given a warning, the second time the cup should not have been given back. I also wouldn't suggest putting him in a bed as a time out, it is a place to sleep not to be punished in. Try a time out in a corner, or in another place you don't want him to associate with as a punishment. Kids do hit their head on the wall, sometimes for attention sometimes because of tiredness- but if your husband thinks he was tired why would he get him? Why not let him just take a nap? It also sends kids the wrong message when parents don't agree and one is seen as 'the punisher' and one is seen as 'the rescuer'. <br>  Talk about with your husband before you have another discipline incident about backing the other up completely and not disagreeing in front of the child.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	It's hard to say that one particular person is right - although I do believe that many toddlers do take fits etc just for the attention, you do need to take care that they don't actually hurt themselves.<br>  If you do time out, you need to be consistent with him and not back down. I tried time out and it didn't work for me, we now work a reward system instead (she has a jar and a load of plastic coins - she earns coins for good behaviour, loses them for bad, and gets treats when she gets certain amounts collected) which works better for us than time out. She would simply get more and more worked up until she was having screaming violent temper tantrums. <br>  If you're worried he's hurting himself, you could always hold him, but refuse to look at him or talk to him. That will be frustrating for him!|`|oUcLSDZ6aa	You're both right. <br>  <br>  He was probably tired still. My daughter gets a little aggressive when she doesn't get enough sleep or is in need of a nap. The head banging is normal for toddlers, and is usually for attention. You were right to discipline him though, he needs to know that violence (on any level) isn't acceptable, even if he is tired. <br>  <br>  However, you might want to rethink time outs in bed, perhaps exchange it with a time out chair. Only because you don't want him to start associating punishment with bed time, then he won't want to sleep either.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	Ignore his fits completely because they are cries for negative based attention. My doctor explained about putting my kids in time out it has to be a neutral spot with a comfort thing blankie or toy and for a minute each year old that the child is. Your husband is wrong and should back you up before this gets out of hand parents must be on the same level to be effective. Otherwise baby learns oh mommy is mean but daddy lets me have.... you know where i am going with that right?|`|qImMwhUHaa	He may just have been tired but that does not excuse his behavior. My boys never hit their heads on anything or banged their heads on things. I suggest putting him in a safer time out position. When mine were younger I would put them in their high chair booster faced against the wall and set the timer.Now they just sit in their time out chair until their time is over. I certainly wouldn't let him get away with that naughty behavior.|`|1S7uXsInaa	In our house when one parent disciplines the other follows through.  If we disagree, we talk about it then go together to discuss that with our child-a united front.  One parent can not be the "savior" in a punishment scenario.  Kids need to know that their parents work together.|`|6ZjoX2Akaa	Honey, spank that kid. I don't mean to the point of child abuse, just 1 or 2 firm swats on the butt isn't going to hurt him one bit. I also put my kids in time out, but for some things a good swat is what they need. Your son might be "just tired", or he may just be testing you to see what he can get away with. But if you let him get away with that stuff now, you will be in for world of trouble later. And yes they do head bang and things like that just for attention. I think that discipline is a must. Your child is needs to know what is acceptable and what is not. <br>  <br>  Edit: I also agree w/ Mrs. Herrera. You should warn him first not to throw his cup, and so on.

AskUKO3Xaa	I have had 2 boys try and have sex the day before and they day of ovulation. Boy sperm are fast little buggers!!! Good Luck!|`|zATQaiwIaa	You can 'try' for what you want - but you still only have a 50/50 chance really.  Your cycle length is from the first day of your period till the day before your period starts again.<br>  Th basic facts are the Y sperm (the female) are stronger and can survive longer in a women but are slower swimmers.  The X (male) sperm are smaller and faster swimmers, but dont survive very long.....so if you want any chance of 'trying' you need to know when you ovulate which you can track a bunch of different ways.  If you BD with your husband on the day you ovulate you have a "greater" chance of conceiving a boy - but there is no guarantee.<br>  If you are not even sure on how to find out how long your cycle length is i would suggest buying a book on getting pregnant and tracking ovulation or doing some research online.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|dtZ3tmoRaa	I do not know of any methods to make a boy, but I am pretty sure that the length of your cycle is from the first day of one period to the first day of the next period, if you count how many days are in between then you have the total length of your cycle.|`|YvwlUs3daa	I would say check the chinese gender calendar. I know alot of people that are skeptical of it but I personally have seen it to be very accurate... The thing alot of people don't know is the trick is to use your lunar age ( you get your lunar age....<br>  <br>  General principle is to add 1 to your 'normal' age if your birth date is past the Chinese New Year.<br>  <br>  For example : If Susan was born January 10th, her Chinese Lunar Age would be 25.<br>  But, if Carol was born on July 9th of the same year, her Chinese Lunar Age would be 26.<br>  <br>  Chinese Lunar Age : The Chinese count the age starting from the birth, every Chinese lunar year which you will traverse, counts for one year more whatever your month of birth. <br>  <br>  If you were born from January 1st - February 20th (inclusive of these dates), you should use your real (Gregorian/English Calendar) age.<br>  <br>  However, if you were born from February 21st - December 31st (again, inclusive of these dates), you should add one year to your Gregorian age.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  give it a try... Actually thats what I'm planning on using... GOOD LUCK!!!

Pregnancy is rough no matter when you do it but teens till about 21 22 there are increased risk of pre ecalpsia, premature birth, low birth weight. I don't think they really know why just the body not really being 100% ready to do it.<br>  <br>  Then older women 35 till menopause of higher chances of having a child with dowyn syndrome, and  a harder time even getting pregnant.  <br>  <br>  My wife is diabetic and she was told that her best time to have kids was between 25 and 30 that  is when women had the lowest risk and that because she already had a risk factor pregnancy was going to be hard .|`|kbIkVS0raa	I've never heard that but I did get it with my first and I was 18.

zDeEaja0aa	Generally if an adult hears a child has passed away they assume it was caused due to an illness/disease or disorder. The reason being children are very young, most are very healthy, and the odds are that their death was caused due to car accident, plane crash, drugs (In teens more common but still low), etc...are very slim Even though we hear of a lot of murders and reported abuse case sin overall percentages are extremely low when you compare these percentages to an illness of some form.|`|AA12145826	Honestly, my first thought is "How tragic!" I'm sure its only natural to assume that it was some illness and not an act (which many would see as being preventable) that lead to a child's passing. An illness is like a "out of your control" type thing where an act of some sort (be it an accident, abuse, intentional killing, suicide, etc.) seems to be within the realm of our control (even when it isn't).<br>  <br>  And for the record, I am deeply sorry for your loss.|`|fvurQyf9aa	No,  i always think they might died in a car crush, suicide.<br>  I never really heard a kid died becaouse of illness unless they die when they are born. I ussually dont think kids die becaouse of illnesses, they are so young how could, they get that sick.|`|TXddP0uxaa	I think it depends on the wording you use:  If you say she "passed away"  that sounds like a death due to illness.  If you say she died or "we lost her", personally my mind goes to an accident or some other tragedy.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	No. <br>  sadly a lot of children die from abuse.<br>  And now a days, they are often murdered, usually by their own flesh and blood.<br>  Its sickening.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	it really depends on the age.. the younger the child the higher the % of illness related deaths..|`|foUPphu2aa	I automatically think tragic.<br>  <br>  EDIT - I'm sorry for your loss.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I assume illness or car accident.|`|s6cP15tFaa	No, I don't think illness, I think of some kind of birth defect, because my daughter passed away about an hours after birth, because she was born without kidneys.|`|4Hy4iRgKaa	no actually.<br>  i usually assume like murders or accidents.<br>  <br>  or illness i guess.<br>  <br>  why do u ask?:P|`|7cHsAoFPaa	Mostly yes with the many diseases in today society.|`|AtvEOfj0aa	No because like adults there a lot of different ways someone can die... even if they are children.|`|jH2NZTCuaa	no, i think of a car crash, because its most likely where i live.|`|b2ZwhOqsaa	yes, becuase most kids I hear of dying are usually related to health issues.|`|2Yj4jTqhaa	It depends where I am hearing it from.<br>  <br>  Obviously if it's from the a family member of friend, I automatically assume illness.<br>  <br>  If it's in a newspaper or on the news, I usually assume car crash or some sort of accident.<br>  <br>  If they had gone missing, they probably would have used the word "missing" instead of admitting they are without a doubt dead.<br>  <br>  I never really assume murder or suicide. I dunno why.|`|uwx7etCXaa	I think that factors that influence your thinking would be the age, and location of residence.  If the child resides in a really rough neighborhood, things that might come to mind would be a stray bullet, or a hit and run accident.  If the child is a teenager in a rough neighborhood, gang involvement, or gang retaliation can come to mind.  If the child is young and resides in a middle class area you might assume it would be illness.  If the child is a teenager residing in a middle class area I would think that people would assume drug overdose or some sort of run in with the wrong crowd.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Well, actually, I know that some kids die unexpectedly and the cause is not discovered until afterward. Sometimes it's something that the doctor missed. Some parents are still wondering how SIDS could occur in their toddlers, evidently. It keeps us mindful of enjoying our kids while they are still well because you never know about tomorrow. Illness is the second thing I think of. In this case, the cause is known and the parents are racing against time. Some of them get lucky. Others have to let go and appreciate the time they had. It's so hard for any parent to have to go through this. In the old times, it wasn't uncommon for parents to lose several kids. I didn't know how they did it. Maybe they just thought about reuniting in heaven. What were you thinking?|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I cynically enough assume a parent or someone else kidnapped them and killed them.  Sorry i know that doesnt ease your loss....i think they are just curious as to what happened to her.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Depends on the child's age, under 10 yeah. Then it would be  late teens suicide or overdose or car accident.
hv2nmmrqaa	Well i think he has just as much right to choose as you do. So i would say you either stick with him or you leave him.|`|t14FHs7Laa	well, if you are married, both of you should be on the same page.  If you are not married, you can have a baby but you may have a hard time getting him to pay child support and stuff.  if you are already pregnant, adoption is the best way to go.  That way you are giving a person a chance at life and a couple a chance for a family.
smsUZG4Iaa	how old are you?|`|gPlUDaRoaa	Wow,well your going to have to just wait & see if you get your period.Chances are that your not so just calm down & relax.There is nothing else you can do.As for the stomach ache your feeling it could be anything like your nerves,or even stress.|`|zMj2ikmeaa	If you're worried and worked up about the whole situation, your stomach might be tied up in knots, soreness at the pantie line could be muscles getting a real work out from having sex...the cramping could be from both.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're worried about getting pregnant, there's more to worry about that that...even if a condom is being used. Aside from STDs, if you're not using an alternative form of birth control, you need to strongly consider using that in addition to a condom...and the Pill is not the best form either...I know several women who got pregnant while on the pill.<br>  <br>  Just remember that with active sex life comes adult reponsibilities should you happen to get pregnant. <br>  <br>  I would say more but I don't want to turn in to a preacher-stranger and inflict morals and politics on you.<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself and be careful.<br>  <br>  To the person who just propositioned you in his answer...buddy you just got reported. Joking or not, how do you know you're not propositing a very young girl? Joking or not, you're using the wrong quorum for that answer!|`|cQMWB6S0aa	It's normal for the stomach ache especially for girls loosing thier virginity.  Just because you loose your virginity does not mean you bleed; not every girl bleeds when she looses her virginity.  You need to be careful and not get pregneant if that is not what you want to be right now.  The best rule is to wait and have sex after marriage.|`|5dc42b275b638aa5e6b0b8b56bcb0c75aa	If you are not ready to deal with the consequences of the "what ifs" after having sex, then you should not be having sex.  <br>  <br>  Condoms are not 100% safe.  You need to go to the dr and start your yearly exam as well as talk to him/her about getting on some sort of birth control.|`|IsYYr9Vraa	uhm your stomach has been hurting for two days, but you lost your virginity yesterday? <br>  well maybe your about to get you period and your not pregnant.<br>  <br>  uhm try to wait till your old enough where you will have no worries of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  :-D|`|McyBIwvlaa	If you are 18 or over you can get the morning after pill from CVS. They ask for ID. and it's about $40. Or you can go to planned parenthood for the pill but you have to be 18 or older. Babies comes with having sex and if you don't want any maybe you should wait until you have more control over the situation......like get the morning after pill or an abortion if that's what you want to do. But as a minor you have to go with you parents of those kind of things.|`|YD9U6Xs5aa	everyone is worried when they first have sex about all the 'what ifs'. if your that unsure if you havnt had a period get a test done but you wont be pregnant (:<br>  & its normal to hurt, i did for a few days after. but if you really that worried, you can still take the morning after pill!<br>  good luck :)|`|pkhj65uUaa	You're not pregnant. It is normal for abdominal pain to occur (the thrusting.. duh.. that your body is not used to). If you want to be super safe go take a morning after pill but you would have to do that ASAP because they lose effect after the 3rd day|`|6FEGRHC3aa	its supposed to hurt right there for a couple of days its normal so dont worry<br>  thats weird cuz arent u suppose 2 bleed a lil bit|`|LDPabWk0aa	Is normal at first when you lose you virginity maybe for couple of days you feel like that i don't think your pregnant|`|5sDiuj0Yaa	First off, I would try to remain calm.  What you are feeling is very normal, not only stress about losing your virginity and about pregnancy, but the body aches you are feeling as well.  The lack of bleeding is irrelevant and up to each individual woman.  Secondly, if you partner used a condom and did not climax while he was in you, you should be fine.  However, if you are still concerned you should consult your doctor and allow them to conduct a pregnancy test.  If that is something that you don’t want to do at this time, you can wait awhile and get an over-the-counter test that should confirm that you aren’t pregnant...it sounds like you’ll be fine, but the test will put the issue to rest.
IWBpfOXWaa	If your breasts are really tender and sore, that it a sure sign that you might be pregnant, especially given the other symptoms you have been experiencing.  You should definitely take a test!|`|DCwGQDO9aa	Absoultly, you need a test and one now.<br>  <br>  It's irregular for you not to have your period 6 days after your last period date.  Anything more than 6 weeks is considered extremely late, and your saying that your 2 1/5 months late.<br>  <br>  Changes of pregnancy are high, and to be safe you need to find out one way are the other.|`|LDPabWk0aa	take a test maybe you get  better answer.|`|pkhj65uUaa	If it's been that long that you don't get your period it could be because of other things. You could be particularly stressed at the time or there may have been some weight imbalances within the last few months. Also, you could be pregnant. If you are not pregnant then maybe you are just subconsciously portraying the symptoms of a preggo girl.<br>  <br>  Take the test just in case|`|OmuE1MTBaa	i would just to be safe
olKKT2LTaa	There should be a very small chance of conception when using IUD. Go to the docs about irregular bleeding. Cramps could just be ovulation or normal period pains. I never had cramps when I was pregnant until I went into labour! I have more cramping now throughout month and I have had IUD for about 6 months.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's more likely these things you are experiencing are from the IUD. Wait about a week and take a pregnancy test. IF you are pregnant, which I doubt, you need to get the IUD removed ASAP.
MR9iBgafaa	The only test that you can buy over the counter would be an ovulation test to see if you're ovulating.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	They are all accurate and FDA approved. I took a Dollar Store brand test 4 days before my period was due and got a good positive.<br>  <br>  You can also go to: peeonastick.com<br>  <br>  They have tons of info on pregnancy tests and even have reviews.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you would have to go to the doctor. <br>  only they can perform the tests that you are looking for|`|dC5lDpfQaa	hi<br>  my husband and i were trying for a baby for 2 1/2 years until we decided to find out why we were finding it hard to fall pregnant. i was sent for a scan on my ovaries by my doctor and was told i have polycystic ovarian syndrome and was told it would be difficult to get pregnant! however after 3 years of trying i had my beautiful baby boy who is now coming up to 3! we have since decided to try for another baby and after another year and a half of trying decided to go back to the doctors to see if there was anything he could do so he then sent us to a fertility clinic to have my husband tested as well....but on the day are appointment's came through we found out i was pregnant again ive now got 8 weeks to go!<br>  <br>  the point to my story was that don't give up hope and go see your doctor! if you do have a smilier problem to mine there are tablets that they can give you to help you ovulate or other treaments that will help and you never know sod's law will be you'll find out your pregnant and wont have to go for all the tests! good luck x|`|AA11609300	Unfortunately, this is not a test that can be bought over-the-counter.

aJLx0nhNaa	I think he's probably fine. Sunglasss earpeices are not sharp.  My son has shoved the handle of his plastic spoon down his own throat a few times.  He's fine.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	If it tore his esophagus I promise you would know it, he wouldn't be laughing and playing, He's fine, just be glad he didn't shove it in his eye.|`|VCCKfT3taa	See how he does with his next feeding; if he seems to be swallowing well then I wouldn't be worried. When serious damage is done to the throat or it swells up from an injury there should be some symptoms like a little blood, pain, irritability, or difficulty feeding. <br>  <br>  But if my non-professional opinion I think he'll be okay. Big scare, but you'll probably have a few more of those in the next few years.|`|27m0O7wPaa	You said you already called your doc.  If its been an hour and they haven't called you back it never hurts to give them another call.  The squeaky wheel gets oiled as they say.  If he is acting fine the chances that he did any real damage are low.  In never hurts to ask the doc they are there specifically for that reason.|`|foJm2Yftaa	I think that he'll be okay. I had the experience when I was 6 months old. :P  Good Luck! Lol
FHT6wsUpaa	I didn't have a written plan per se, but I did have VERY clear provisions on how I wanted everything handled.<br>  <br>  I pretty much sacrificed all of it, thanks to my emergency c-section. And, because I had to go under general anesthesia, nobody but the doctor and the medical team was allowed in the room. It didn't matter who I'd asked to be there or not be there...nothing happened the way it was *supposed* to.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, hubby got to hold Angela almost immediately, and he was the one to give her the first bath. I don't think he put her down until he laid her in my arms for the first time 3 hours later.<br>  <br>  In hindsight, I wish I'd had a plan and a backup plan...so that I wouldn't have been so disappointed that things didn't go the way I expected them to.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Less than 10 weeks now!|`|Lr3lZ4draa	i made one, but totally forgot to print itt out when i went to the hospital. i wish i would have though, the doctor cut my sons umbilical cord, when my boyfriend was looking forward to doing it.<br>  unless they dont allow the fathers to cut it anymore, im not sure.|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I made one wanting natural birth and waterbirth at a birthing center and I wanted it taped and all but then I developed pregnancy induced hypertension, went into labor at 35 weeks, stayed on magnesium and blood pressure med just long enough to get the steroid shots for her lungs before my reflexes were uncontrollable they had to induce me before I went into having seizures and I got the epidural because I was too sick to handle the pain. My baby went straight to nursery and I was too sick to get out of bed to go see her but we both survived :) and I was surprised we did vaginal delivery and not c-section. I guess it's like that saying "if you want to make God laugh tell him your plans". My plan was like 3 pages long too and it would have been nice but I'm over it now.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I left it to right at the last minute, when I knew I was getting induced a bit early anyway.  I did it the night before the induction, hehe.  Mine was really basic:<br>  <br>  BF and mum as birth partners<br>  Want to use entonox<br>  Will ask for epidural if/when I want it<br>  Want baby to be delivered directly onto my chest<br>  Partner will cut cord<br>  Baby to be given vit. K<br>  Drugs to help deliver placenta<br>  <br>  So I got everything I "wanted".  Preferably I'd have gone into labour naturally, but that wasn't an option.  Things like rooming in are a given in the UK, we don't put babies into a nursery (as far as I'm aware).|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I made one and it was sort of followed. I ended up having a ventouse delivery and my hubby didn't cut the cord but thats understandable.<br>  <br>  My Midwife said make it as short as you can as they don't have time to read it all.<br>  <br>  I just did bullet points:<br>  <br>  *Birth partners Mum and Hubby<br>  <br>  *Pain relief: nothing unless its a last resort<br>  <br>  and so on.<br>  Midwife seemed pretty happy with that.|`|tMxGi4hPaa	I didn't have a birth plan, but everything went just like I wanted anyway. Of course it helps that I had the most awesome doctor ever, too. I hope my next child birth goes as well!|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	I did and used all of it accordingly minus the emergency c section, even after that it was still followed.  I was induced didnt want any pain meds/epidural which we followed up until the c section and I wanted to nurse my daughter ASAP which I did not even an hour after she was born.  I didnt want her to have a pacifier, sugar water, formula or any kind of bottle.  I didnt want her to leave my husbands sight so he followed to the nursery while she got all checked and stayed with her the entire time until they both came back to me :)  So yes its important and can be followed, you just may have to reinterate it a few times!!|`|9yJdY4s0aa	The staff in hospitals secretly laugh at birth plans.  They are under no obligation whatsoever to abide by birth plans created by the parents-to-be, and they think the plans are for control freaks.  This is not always true, but that's what they will think.  It is a complete waste of time to write up a birth plan, in my opinion.  You can by all means express your wishes --hey, I don't want med. students in the delivery room and yeah, I'd like to room with my baby.  But don't submit a written plan--it will be ignored and ridiculed.|`|EeGgovyCaa	Nothing went as planned for me. Things that weren't expected...<br>  <br>  I was put on bedrest<br>  I was induced at 37.5 weeks<br>  Was taken to operating room where only my SO was allowed to be in<br>  Was given saddleblock and not an epidural<br>  Was given morphine afterwards, so was out of it pretty much the whole time the babies were being examined. <br>  My OB was on vacation so another doc delivered my babies<br>  <br>  The ONLY thing that went as planned was I delivered vaginally. I didn't want to have a c-section<br>  <br>  Basically everything happened so fast, it was like a dream. don't have too many expectations because pregnancy and labor are so unpredictable.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Yes I did and NEVER will again. It was just a waste of my time, I wrote it out like my birth would be perfect. When you get induced and you are dialated from 1-10 in a matter of 2 hours, you don't give a crap if there are students in there with you. That was one of mine. I was dialated to a 10 and two girl students came in and asked if they could watch. It was actually nice, since I only had my fiance in there, it was nice that one of the girls was massaging my back while waiting for my OB (stupid OB) to get there and the other was holding my hand.<br>  <br>  -My husband and my Mom are the only ones allowed in the room during delivery...that probably doesnt even have to be said ahead of time, its not like they are going to ask you in the birthing room if "they" should let other people in.<br>  <br>  baby is to be examined on my chest, unless medically unable to...at my hospital they did this anyways, not sure if its standard or not.<br>  <br>  -Rooming in , unless I ask for her to be taken to the nursery...they did this anyways, its "probably" pretty standard unless you take her back to the nursery yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't take this in a rude way, I am just letting you know, it was a complete waste of my time. Most of these things they will ask you anyways when you are there.<br>  <br>  :)|`|OZ474DMYaa	I think it's a good thing to have even if you don't go by it word for word. It's a reminder for yourself and lets everyone else know what you expect. I had one but nothing went according to my plan. lol. It all worked out though and everything was fine but I just wish it would have gone differently. The way mine went I wasn't really able to enjoy everything or my son when he was born. This next time will be planned so I should be able to enjoy it more unless something else goes on. Congrats on the baby and good luck :)|`|yxeRpHDUaa	I made one and I found it very useful as it helped familiarise me with the birthing process in hospitals and my rights within that system. It also gave me a clearer idea of what I wanted from my birth. Even if no one read it I would at least know where I stood e.g. whether certain things are compulsory such as Hep B injection (which I didn't want). <br>  <br>  And if does get used it's good to have a list of your wishes in writing because as I guess you know from your first labour there will come a time where you won't remember (or care) what you wrote down!<br>  <br>  I had a Calmbirth midwife who advised me to cut it down to one side of A4. Too much info makes it less likely that people will read it. I was also advised to rename it as 'birth preferences' (or wishes). Small difference but to ensure you know you can never really plan a birth. <br>  <br>  My midwife had mine at least 5 weeks before my due date so she knew what kind of birth I wanted. When I checked into hospital very close to the pushing stage my midwife hadn't arrived yet and the interim midwife referred to my birthplan to get an overview of what I wanted. So in some cases they do get used. In my experience it seems to be doctors that disregard them as they don't see you as participating in the birth process in the same way that midwives do. <br>  <br>  But either way it's good to be informed about the birth and have a visual idea of how you would like it to go. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|olKKT2LTaa	I made one and it was a complete waste of time! However, I enjoyed making it and think even if you don't stick to it, which is highly likely, it's a good idea to have a plan. Make it open and don't get stuck on anything, then you won't be too disappointed if your natural birth pool birth turns into an epidural and an emergency c-section. Having a healthy baby at the end is all that counts. Good luck!|`|AA10125694	I made one for the first one, no one even looked at it... and most of the instructions i gave to the nurses verbally and they were followed.. so it was ok.<br>  <br>  second time, i did not make any.. knew from experience that it was not worth the time... just told the nurses about the bonding after delivery, rooming in, no pacifier for the baby, no formula etc... i guess verbal info is enough.|`|Jsf3Qn8Paa	I made one with my son and really wanted to follow it, but my body had different ideas. I ended up get pre-eclampsia at 37 weeks, which made it impossible for me to have a vaginal birth because they needed to get the baby out asap before I developed full-on eclampsia. I did follow my plan in asking for a 2nd opinion before going in for a c-section. Then my plan went even further off track, because they couldn't do a typical c-section with a spinal, but instead had to use local anesthesia because my blood platelets went too low. Even though nothing went the way I planned, the nurse was glad to see and review my birth plan (before they really knew what was happening). I also followed everything for after my son was born; no formula/sugar water, no nursery stay, minimal time out of my room, someone watching my son at every moment when it was necessary for him to be in the nursery, etc. I can send you my plan, I still have it saved as a Word doc.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	I made one and it was pretty much just like yours at first, then turned into a 2 page deal. Then I went to this website and it had everything I needed. Don't expect the doctors to do everything on it, my doctor didn't even look at it. The nurses did read it, tried to fill the doctor in (he didn't come in until the final pushes) and he said he'd do what he could but the baby was priority #1. Everything varies with hospital also. Congratulations on your little one! Here's the website:<br>  <a href="http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/articles.asp?id=762" rel="nofollow">http://babyfit.sparkpeople.com/articles....</a>|`|ggETPqedaa	I didn't have a birth plan, however my nurses knew what I wanted and not. Each time they had to take the baby out of my room, they knew I wanted him back as soon as possible, I didn't want to have to chase down my baby. He slept in my room with me, from day one.  I had a c-section, emergency so my fiance didn't get to cut the cord. <br>  <br>  So I didn't write one out, but the nurses and the doctor who delievered knew what I wanted. During labor, I didn't want any pain medicine, so they didn't even ask if I wanted it. The nurses are too busy and so is the doctor to take time to read a birthing plan, just let them know what you want.|`|YnLqItJPaa	The hospital I'm having my baby at sends one out as part of its standard pre-admission paperwork and asks you to fill it out.  It asks all the usual questions about who you want in the room, how you want to deal with pain relief, if you plan to breastfeed and how soon you would like to start, if you want visitors immediately or if you want quiet time with your baby, etc.  I found it really helpful and easy to fill out, and I'm glad they send it to expectant moms like myself.  Of course, you have to keep in mind that this is just how you would *ideally* like things to go, and remember that birth doesn't go according to any plan but your baby's and your body's!

ic2B0y7zaa	I had an episiotomy and I only had 4 stitches. It healed in no time and I was in no pain. All doctors have their own opinion about it. But tell you dr to massage your vagina while pushing, it helps to stretch so that you tear or have an eposotomy that will be really painfull.|`|bxlYleZkaa	The only consideration I think where tearing or otherwise is concerned is the fact that any repair, stitches or whatever, will result in scar tissue and a loss of some sensitivity to that part of the perineum. At least a natural tear would probably heal quicker than a straight cut by an impatient midwife. BUT! You might consider giving birth in some position other than on your back with you legs in the air (Most unnatural!!) Both squatting and hands and knees positions eliminate the need for an episiotomy as the muscles are not being elongated, but of course neither positions are "convenient" for the midwife.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	I had an episiotomy with my 2nd delivery as I needed a ventouse so I didn't get a choice (I had an Em c/s first time). People say its better to tear, that it heals better?  Mine healed fine although it was sore as hell for the first few days.|`|EaDkj1JJaa	I left the decision of an episiotomy  up to my doctor because she knew best what was going on. Some woman don't end up needing one and they don't tear. But I would let your doctor know to perform one if they are afraid of tearing because tearing is much more painful when recovering than an episiotomy.<br>  Good luck!!|`|XzbRZCPUaa	my sisters friends have bad stories about tearing , i had an episiotomy 13 years ago and don't remmember it bieng so bad.  i think it is better to have a precise cut than to have it go were its wants on its own|`|qzY6TuQmaa	i healed up just fine after my tearing. im scared of them cutting me so i told my doctor i wouldn't let him cut me like that i didn't even tear that much so it was no big prob.

Those are NOT recommended for babies or small children. You need a cool mist humidifier. There isn't one "best" brand. I'd get an ultrasonic which isn't as loud, and if you can find one that doesn't use filters, it'd be even better. I have a Walgreens brand one and it works great--I've had it for two years with no problems. If you get warm mist, your baby may touch it as she gets older and burn herself, not to mention, the steam is hot. Plus, warmer things harbor more bacteria, so cool mist is always the best option.|`|w3ob12X6aa	i think the humidifer clean the air around you and the vaporizer you usually put like something in it(liks vicks liquid vapor stuff) and helps with congestion and stuffy nose i bought a cheap vaporizer at wal mart for like 14 bucks and works great really helped when my daughter was sick she was really congested. good luck hope she feels better|`|SAgCy83Oaa	The vaporizer usually heats the water and puts more wetness into the air, presumably carrying more of the medicine.

W1xs3vYBaa	The thing with this correlation is that they are comparing breast fed babies and bottled fed ones from years ago. The formulas that use to be used had almost toxic substances in them that have been shown to decrease IQ; therefore, to draw the conclusion that a mothers milk increases IQ may be the wrong cause and effect. <br>  <br>  Today breast milk formula can be found from purely organic materials, with omega 3's added, and omega 3's have been shown to increase neuron transmitters. <br>  <br>  Formula can also be healthier for a child because breast milk contains much of the toxic materials the mother has absorbed into her system, either through food, air pollution or drugs. Breast milk can pass along many of these chemical compounds to the child which can increase their resistance to medications, which furthers the growth of super bugs, or cause damage to the child. <br>  <br>  If the breast milk is from a mother who has never smoked and has had a healthy diet and medical history then the benefits from the milk are great. However, if the mother is unhealthy than the milk's benefits have to be weighed out with the risks.<br>  <br>  Since formula has come a long way I highly doubt, if a mother uses organic omega 3 formula, that you will find the same correlation with IQ and growth as you did in the past. Science has come a long way and 50, to 15, years ago much of what was "safe" has now been found to be almost lethal to humans. The studies from the time are not accurate representations of todays age.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I guess I'd like to see this research.  Have other factors been corrected for?  For example, it is possible that parents with more education and IQ breastfeed more frequently (I say this as an educated formula-feeding mom.)<br>  <br>  All of the advantages of breast milk, health and otherwise, are subtle.  They exist, but it's not black and white.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	Breast milk is not going to turn a moron into a rocket scientist, just as formula won't turn a genius into an idiot.  Genetics determines your potential in terms of IQ...breast milk helps babies to reach their potential in terms of brain development.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	As for the health benefit...yes Breast milk is best. Gives the baby all the antibodies they need to stay healthy. <br>  <br>  As for I.Q....I think parenting , interaction, teaching, genes all play a very important roll in a child's learning development.|`|GqsLNUE8aa	HOT QUESTION!!<br>  <br>  Did you know that the only time an infant's brain is NOT growing is when it is crying? One could argue breastfed babies cry less.:) LOL|`|h59Bc4wfaa	As I was told, breast milk does increase IQ, but not drastically. A couple points max.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	Breastfeeding can only do so much to make up for having bad genes lol.  Personally the only thing I think breastfeeding vs forumula affects any more is immunities and digestability.  You have to breastfeed way more than if you use formula (since formula is heavier) but you can't pass immunities through formula only breastmilk (but if you are planning on staying at home for a while after the baby is born it probably doesn't matter--you aren't going to get many immunities to new sicknesses if you don't go out and the baby isn't going to be exposed to many sicknesses if you don't go out).<br>  <br>  Back in the day when formula was not as well-designed and babies nutritional needs were not as well-known breastmilk was probably vastly superior.  But now-a-days those who make formula know what nutrients it should have to fill a baby's needs.  Formula might even be better to help a baby thrive now if the mother doesn't continue to eat right after the pregnancy.  Since breast milk nutrients depend on what the mother eats and formula nutrients do not.|`|0waHjrQKaa	Ha! I agree with you. I was breastfed and my husband wasn't. We are both college educated. <br>  <br>  Just a side note, I took a breastfeeding class and they said that breastfeeding your baby meant that you baby would have a 10 point higher IQ. How do they test that exactly?|`|QoenvlFuaa	I think I've heard that breastfeeding has the potential to make smarter children, not that it will make smarter children. I believe other factors play a bigger role in determining IQ than breastfeeding.|`|EeGgovyCaa	I think breastmilk is great for a developing immune system, but don't think it has anything to do with their IQ|`|cezWu0Wnaa	I agree with you.|`|heDtLdz5aa	IMO i DO NOT think that it has a role in IQ...|`|GU3RauKOaa	This often confuses people. Breastmilk cannot and will not make you smarter than you were genetically destined to be and than you were raised to be. However, it promotes excellent brain development so it HELPS a child achieve the maximum IQ that they are capable of based on genetics. So if two stupid people have a baby and breastfeed and two geniuses have a baby and formula feed, the formula baby will probably still be more intelligent. He just may have had an IQ a few points higher had he been breastfed.<br>  <br>  So don't think breastfeeding will make you kid a genius, it won't. But it is an excellent way to help your child achieve a higher IQ along with genetics and teaching. :)|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I agree with you.  <br>  <br>  I chose to breastfeed, my sister did not.  Neither of us was breastfed as an infant.  My sister, a lawyer, and her husband, a lawyer and psychologist who works as a college professor, point out the flaw in studies that show that breastfeeding results in significant increases in I.Q. points:  that most women who breastfeed are educates, and therefore may have naturally higher levels of intelligence themselves.  My BIL, who has taught statistical analysis for years, also points out that correlation does not equal causation: in other words, just because A occurs before B, it does not mean that A causes B.  Just like vaccines and autism.  My sister taught herself to read at the age of 3, and my formula-fed niece taught herself to read at the age of 3.5.  So I think it runs in families.<br>  <br>  But breastmilk is still the best choice by far.  :)|`|u6O2EF0taa	well im not that sure that the IQ will be raised. but one way that u can be sure for that to happen in the future is to make sure he studies and stuff but im guessing that u got a long way to go till u get there. anyways i do think that breast milk will be much more healthy. i think it would add more of a nutritional value than if u were to give ur child formula.|`|0lOGuMYNaa	Breast is the best, yes but im not sure about the IQ part of it. I have three kids..two boys ages 5 and one turning 4 in a few days and a 5 month old baby girl. I never breastfed my boys and they are both Very smart. My 5 year old is already reading and spelling. My almost 4 yr old can spell.<br>   I am however breastfeeding my little girl.<br>  I think you should do what you want to because it's Your choice...not because of what "studies" say.|`|h85kkDsbaa	i agree with you, health benefits yes, higher IQ no|`|7ee2e58a43d3c7214fd3e8cb1f2c131eaa	Yes I agree with you.Teaching them,spending time with them and all that helps them learn more and teaches them to be smarter.It has nothing to do with what they eat.|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	No, not drastically higher.  But it's designed to give optimal support for cognitive development, and formula is not designed for it.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean that formula fed babies certainly can't achieve optimal IQ, but breastmilk does a better job in supporting it.<br>  <br>  If you took two genetically identical babies and read to one, but not to the other and kept everything else the same, what would be the difference between them with regard to reading ability?  Maybe nothing at all, but the baby who was supported through his reading has a greater odds of being better at reading because of that support.  But the other baby might be just as good despite it.<br>  <br>  Does the difference have to be drastic for it to be meaningful?|`|TJusfEnlaa	Yup I agree. I don't think breastfed babies are smarter at all. Eg. My nephew and my son are the same age. (9 months) Colby is 2 weeks older than my Jake and is exclusively breastfed and Jake has been formula fed since he was 5 weeks old. Jake is walking, clapping hands, waving bye bye, dancing when music comes on or you tell him to, has been using the pincer grip for months, says mum, dad, nan, ta, up and cat and has 7 teeth. Colby just learnt to crawl at 9 months, has 2 teeth, can't say any words with meaning, and is not clapping. <br>  So there :P|`|lD0VcAlpaa	The health benefits--you can't argue about. However, here's an article about the breast milk vs. IQ thing, it's not meant to offend anyone, it's just an article.<br>  <br>  ::<br>  <br>  A large study recently co-conducted by the University of Edinburgh and Scotland's Medical Research Council found that breastfed babies do indeed tend to be smarter than formula-fed babies. But it also found that mothers who breastfeed also tend to have higher IQs and more education, and tend to provide more stimulating home environments than formula-feeding mothers. Once the numbers were corrected to account for the mom's IQ, the relationship between breastfeeding and intelligence disappeared. (And there was no statistical difference between siblings when one was breastfed and one wasn't.) The study, analyzing data on nearly 5,500 American children, was published in the British Medical Journal in October 2006. Previous studies, for the most part, hadn't factored in the mom's IQ when declaring that breastfeeding made babies smarter.
tbeO3Lataa	Been there. Well, not in the exact same spot, but you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but don't say or do anything, and they will loose the satisfaction of it. You did the right thing by saying you weren't going to listen to them anymore.|`|kF9aHWfUaa	That doesnt seem like a joke to me at all.U did the rite thing by telling them to **** off.|`|6xmIPYimaa	ignore them.|`|MDsufhrZaa	kick their asses.<br>  or get somebody else to do it.|`|M45dkINAaa	These boys are bullies and must be sorted out honey.  If they have been pestering you since 3rd grade, you must tell someone like a teacher or your parents.  They know that they are getting to you, which is why they keep doing it...please tell someone, dont suffer in silence. <br>  <br>  You must believe in yourself, go on...look in the mirror and repeat 3 times "I am beautiful"  and say this every time you pass a mirror.<br>  <br>  Chin up honey|`|DEIxwvKPaa	get somebody to kick their asses<br>  tell them to grow up<br>  insult them in front of a bunch of people|`|cdAQZJGpaa	just like tell them off and like be mean to them! thats wat i would do! hope i helped at least a little!|`|SEzIkGNiaa	You said the right thing.  Telling them not to talk to you is good.  Even if its a joke, its not nice to joke about it, especially to girls.  <br>  <br>  Ignore them, if you show them that it hurts you, they will continue to do it.|`|VyuseWb2aa	You did the right thing, just leave them and ignore them... Eventually, one day they will see their mistake.
oiJITSNZaa	How about a break? I know you dearly love your husband and baby but sometimes you just need a break! Maybe a day doing something you haven't done since baby is here. Or maybe a weekend away from home. I know DH gets the brunt of everything that bugs them...at least mine does...and I dearly love him. It's normal to feel down after the baby is here. So much has happened in those three months!<br>  I would talk it over with your midwife too and see what she recommends. Some midwives have licenses to give prescriptions and some don't. <br>  Good Luck and welcome to the mother world!!:)|`|GGBDkOuFaa	maybe some Abilify! Go see a Dr. and not the midwife.
mDYsr62maa	He's feeling insecurity which is understandable given the situation.  As long as the entire family helps to make him feel that he does not need mommy in the room all the time he will eventually move past this.  Just continue to give him your support.  If he does not after a few months, some professional counseling may be needed but most of the time they adapt at that age..
UJoYGmZAaa	im 15 and i have a facebook. I would wait until shes in high school at least, shes not gonna miss anything. But it's really not a bad site. Most people make it up to be bad, but if you know what your doing and don't act dumb, you'll be good. If you do let her, make sure she adjusts the privacy settings. You can make it where you don't see a picture or anything about her except her name. After that, your pretty much set. She will just have contact with her friends. Then it'll just be a fun way for her to get in touch with them and socialize!|`|ZIkVyxNpaa	I'm fifteen and my younger sister is eleven and we both have a facebook and yes my mom does know, she has one herself and we are friends. Facebook can be very very safe if you set it on the right settings. Just because she has one does not mean that any one can find her because she can set it to private so that people can't find her unless she friend requests them first. Also you could set it up so that all notices will be sent to your e-mail, so then you will be notified of everything she does. It is your decision, but you should know that it can be as safe as you want it to be, so if you help her make one then she should have no problems.|`|13bzwOoNaa	My mom didn't want me to have a facebook either, but recently we made a deal that I can have a facebook as long as she has the password too and checks it regularly.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Yea, me personally my kid wouldn't be aloud to register for anything online till they're 18 lol. But not being so strict, 13 since it's the rules for Facebook for you if you feel you must. Facebooks pretty innocent. I have an account and theres pretty much no way to private message (that I know of), anything you do or say to anyone else everyone sees on your main page. IF I were to agree to let my kid have an account on Facebook, it would definitely be regulated anyway, and certain amount of computer time allotted a week.(I say 2 hours a week tops). If she wants to waist her computer time on Facebook, that's her problem.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I'm not sure if you're allowed to be 12 on facebook. If I were you, I would let her have one but make my own page and request she be your friend. On facebook most postings notify all your friends when you post or someone else posts on your wall. It's a lot easier to track than myspace.|`|sxecXFgraa	You're suppose to be 13 to have one, but most people lie about their age on Facebook, MySpace, or whichever networking site you let her join (if you let her).  Make sure she marks everything as private or friends only.  Even though her page is set to friends only, talk to her about not putting personal information on there (phone number, address, school info, etc).  It is easy to hack into these websites.  Create an account for you so you can monitor her and make sure you know the password to her account.|`|rSWX0CZ7aa	You have to be 13 to join, so she wouldn't be able to have an account right now unless she registered with a fake birthday, which she definitely shouldn't do.  Wait until she turns 13, and then it'll be okay as long as she's responsible, trustworthy, and understands that it's dangerous to give out personal information and talk to strangers.  The only thing she should ever do on facebook is talk to her friends, not anyone that she doesn't know in real life.  Also, if she ever gets an account, make sure she sets it on private, meaning that only people who go to her school and/or who she adds as a friend will be able to see her profile.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	It's not intended for kids her age.  It was originally ONLY for college students, and while anybody can make an account, it's still almost entirely high school age kids and up.  A kid her age has no need for one, she doesn't have high school friends to keep in touch with while she's in college--which is what most people use it for, that and getting to know new friends at college.  If you don't mind a social networking site, maybe in a few years a private myspace-- that's much more common for kids close to her age, but she'll need supervision and I personally wouldn't recommend it until she's 16+ and/or old enough to have a facebook-- and even then only if she is very, very responsible.  I had a myspace at 16 and now have a facebook at 20 because it's a little bit more mature, but either way, I wouldn't let my kids do it until they were MUCH older than 12.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	compromise. you have to be at least 13 to have a facebook. Tell her she can get one when she's 13. There's not really much to do on facebook for a 12 year old. It's a social network. You talk to your friends from school on it and stuff. It's great if you're mature enough for it. But lots of kids now days are not aware of internet safety. So, if you do let her, you should monitor her account. If you make one yourself and add her as a friend you can see everything she does and everyone she talks too.|`|ydYi0lu2aa	12 might be a bit young but I know many children younger with Facebook pages. You could try waiting until she's 13 because that is the age requirement. Also, as many people have said, create a page for yourself and monitor her account. Set some ground rules and make sure you are both clear. Write them out too so you can both go back and you aren't relying purely on memory. Please send me a message if you need any further help or have any questions.<br>  <br>  Charlotte|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	No, not yet but you should get yourself an account and familiarize yourself. It is an important part of being an informed parent. I would also come up with a responsibility plan with her and as she shows responsibility then you will give her permission to have an account. This way she is working towards it.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I don't know much about face book, but I know on Myspace you can make the profile private to anyone over 18. I think age 14 or 15 is when kids can start to be trusted with the internet independently. Why does she really need it? It's common for teenagers to have profiles on those sites, but do are any of her friends registered on there? I don't think everyone would let their 12 year old do that and she doesn't need to be talking to anyone online except her friends.|`|jlajkhcBaa	last time i checked, facebook was a highschool networking site<br>  <br>  dont let her on untill the summer before her freshman year|`|m9g6tBqiaa	yes, wait until 13.<br>  dont let her put too much personal info, adress, phone #, ect. Facebook is mostly safe, though!|`|4WyUrWaIaa	Considering you have to be 13 to join facebook, I wouldn't let her !|`|IIKwBSrxaa	Be a meanie butt and don't let her, because I'm 13 and my 'rentals won't let me have a MySpace.  It's only fair.|`|fv6jIn59aa	create your own facebook account and monitor her so she can be safe but not disappointed
aKiynqA6aa	i wouldn't worry about a 9 year old.  at least i wouldn't worry about my 9 year old.  if you have a little dare devil then you might be concerned that he might try jumping off or something like that and maybe breaking an arm or something.  when we had our bunk beds up my 3 year old figured out how to climb to the top without the ladder, so i was a little worried about that and we took them down.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I've found that bunk beds have a rail on the top. I have them for my kids, and I have for a few years. They were 6 and 3 when I got them the bed. I haven't had one issue. The only thing I can suggest for added safety is if the ladder is all metal, get some foam to go around the bars of the ladder and glue them on. The metal can be slippery, and hurt their feet. At 9 he should be more than fine. <br>  I had a set of bunk beds with my sister when I was younger. They were the wooden kind that came apart to make 2 single beds. Those I wouldn't recommend. It's nothing but a small dowel holding them together, with a little jumping on the top, or kicking the top one from the bottom, they can snap that dowel and come apart. lol My sis and I figured this out.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I'm sorry, but I agree with your mother. Maybe he could use the top bunk for playing, but I wouldn't let him sleep up there because when you aren't conscious you might roll around or something. Age has nothing to do with it.
p2YkMMSvaa	Stay off of cloggy foods like dairy and starch. If that doesn't help see your doctor|`|AXEqOEloaa	Oh I feel your pain, I am pregnant now and I swear I get heartburn from water. My husband thinks I over react but it is terrible.
VyroqDxAaa	I would agree with your OB, it takes three months for the Vitex to really start working and for you to notice any changes. I was on Vitex, and Maca Root for the same thing as you....I don't Have periods and I don't Ovulate on my own. Unfortunatly I never was able to find out if it worked cause I had a small window that I had to conceive in cause my hubby was deploying, so I gave up the natural route and got on Clomid. But I did lots of research on them before taking them and everything I read said they take at least 3 months to kick in....so I think it really just was a quincedence that you started your period right after taking it. Just my opinion though (well I guess your OBs too), good luck!|`|stRWElvPaa	The vitex might have balanced your hormones and caused you to shed your uterine lining (have a period) but the lining would have been building up since october. since you didn't ovulate for 3 months or so then the estrogen in your body would have been continuing to build up your lining and then one day it started shedding, but there was a lot so you bled a lot. <br>    That is my guess from reading a lot of articles on this kind of subject.<br>    Crampy/twingy feelings in the left or right lower side of your abdomen can indicate ovulation, and since it was in the middle of your cycle I would guess it was. <br>    Now see if you get your period in 2 weeks, if not take a pregnancy test. <br>    you can start tracking your temperatures to see if you ovulate, go to www.fertilityfriend.com that's what I do anyway.<br>    good luck!!
AA10125694	location - california, bay area<br>  day care type - home based licensed day care<br>  <br>  For infants from 6 weeks onwards, my daughter's day care charges $750 per month. <br>  <br>  The parents supply the diapers, formula and wipes. But the day care lady is so nice that she does not ask for diapers,wipes if she is short of them. She buys them herself too and starts using them. Ofcourse noone should take her kindness for granted and resupply the stuff on time. <br>  <br>  For formula, she insists on using what the child is already using and so we have to be careful when the formula needs to be restocked.|`|tMxGi4hPaa	I'm in North Dakota, and for 30+ hours a week, it ranges from $100-$120, with in-home daycares being on the cheaper end. That's with us providing diapers, wipes & formula. On top of that, you generally have to pay a deposit in the amount of 2 weeks worth of fees. I only need somebody to keep my daughter about 10 hours a week, and I've found that daycares want to charge the same amount whether I'm using them 10 hours or 40, so we've just found a babysitter to come to our house for $6/hour.|`|AA10333002	Anywhere from 700 to 3000 a month.  The cheapest way to go is private in home day care.  If you want your baby in a religious day care, or a learning center where they teach sign language and other languages, it gets even more pricey.<br>  I think my baby better be the next president when I pick him up if I'm paying thousands.... personally I think that's crazy.

I'm in Kansas City and here you can expect to pay at least $225/week for an infant in a large day care center, but most probably run more like $300/week.  Diapers and wipes are usually provided by the parent.  In-home care will run less, but I'm not sure how much.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I live in Australia.  I had my daughter at a childcare centre and I was paying $315AU per week for full-time care.  50% of that amount you get back through the government rebate but this is done every 4 months and it can take up to 6 months to get your money back.  I have now got my daughter in private childcare (a lady does it from her home) and I pay $175AU per week for full-time care.

It sound trashy in any language. <br>  You'll end up like those couples with names like "Dyimonde" instead of "Diamond", or "Ilesabethe" instead of "Elizabeth"<br>  <br>  I guess if I'd have to choose, it would be Armani, but even that's a stretch.<br>  <br>  But who am I to judge? "Wendy" wasn't a name until it first appeared in the book Peter Pan!|`|HeVXAjwMaa	I like Norelle best, its a pretty girly name. I like my name (Gracie) and my sisters are called Olive, Mae, Verity and Ann- Cloteale. I think they are all pretty and unsual names.Xx|`|KNX2sKr7aa	Not my style.  I prefer classic names with traditional spellings.  Of yours... if I had to pick one I liked the best, it would be Alayna.|`|MhYxQZmjaa	I like Jacey Brianne. It flows well.
UbCzA2JVaa	I love Charlie for a little girl, and Aliza is a beautiful name too. I don't really like Damean, but I love Parker, so I would change that to Parker Damean.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|2E3Vl1Wlaa	I don't really care for the spelling of Charlee.  I like Parker but don't care for Damean, they seem a little weird together to me.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I love the boys name! I personally don't really like Charlee for a girl, but I love the middle name.|`|CrjozlCjaa	They don't actually seem all that unique just rather odd spellings of the same old names.    Sorry!|`|cXdoFRVsaa	I don't really like the spelling you have I like Damian the best. For Charlee maybe have Charlee as the nickname...?|`|OF7ZHq19aa	I don't like charlee for a girl but I like aliza and damean is a cute name allso|`|0SqWGUSHaa	LOVE THEM.<br>  completely loving them.<br>  Congradulations by the way :]|`|jhPlVj0oaa	I'm so sorry but I really really don't like either of them.|`|PRGUQFVqaa	Charlee sounds a little too masculine for a girl-dameon parker is cool- what about jet joshua? Duke is suck a cute middle name my friend named her boy nixon duke and i thinkits so cool|`|Fwq3xVWXaa	I really like the girl first name.<br>  And I like the whole boy name but as Damien|`|ioGfuwOPaa	I like both of them. They are nice names.|`|G6h7mjdpaa	I love Charlee for a girl. It's so cute. I'm not too partial on Damean though....but I like Parker|`|cp32nEVWaa	Cute they will work|`|bUcWxQqpaa	Kacio & Kalia<br>  kay-see-oh / kah-lee-ah|`|AA11569882	Hm.  I don't get the odd spellings, I mean, yes, your child is unique and deserves a unique name etc, but 'unique' doesn't work on a job application.  Plus they'd go through their whole lives saying "no, it's spelt..." and it would get boring pretty quickly.<br>  <br>  How about Charlotte?  It's a beautiful name, and you can call her Charley and she can call herself Charley, but she'd have Charlotte for her colleagues and distant acquaintances.  I like Damien, why not put his dads name, or grandads name for his middle name?|`|nZVmkZSBaa	I like the names, but the spellings are pretty hideous. It's Damien, and Charlie. I like Charlie for a girl, pretty cute IMO. Damien is okay, not great though. I prefer Deron Parker, Caleb Ryan, Jeremy Lucas, Justin Lee or Stephen Alexander. For Damien, I like Damien Lee, Damien Sean, Damien Chase, Damien Craig, Damien Marcus, Damien Blake or Damien Elias. I like Charlie, but I'm not too fond of Aliza. I prefer Charlie Raine, Charlie Madison, Charlie Elizabeth, Charlie Linley or Charlie Mikya.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I like Charlee Aliza and I also like the spelling Charli as well.<br>  Damean looks like (duh-mean) as apposed to damien.|`|Hx47O8llaa	I LOVE those!<br>  If my mom named me that..I would feel soo unique|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Super Cute!  Love them Both!
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Well. I suppose as long as the volume is pretty low,and the baby isn't staring at the monitor,but just sitting close by,shouldn't be a problem. But I wouldn't do this on a regular basis. A child needs parent to parent attention and contact. Make sure you have your priorities in check. Child comes before video games.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I don't think its that bad! BUT...i would do it after she goes to bed and turn down the volume!
ZLpgjLPyaa	I definitely would not rush getting pregnant. I am married 08/18/2007 and have a 6 year old from a previous relationship. It is nice not to have a baby during the first year, you get to know eachother, you get to be newlyweds and go out and have fun! We have a blast with our daughter but also when she goes to my parents for spring break/summer we get to fall in love with eachother again. I know how badly you want a child, we have been ttc after losing our baby but just make sure that it is the right timing and you do not pressure him into it. Have you ever done something because someone wanted you to and even though you didnt? It doesnt feel right and you definitely want him to feel right about being a father. Also do not listen to the person that said withhold sex from him, first of all you should never use sex as a way to get something. It even says in the bible for husband and wife to not withhold sex so that neither of you lust for anyone or anything else. Talk about it and set a date like on your 1 year anniv you will start trying, it can take from 6mos to a year to get pregnant. Good luck and lots of marriage dust to you!!!!!!!|`|wnQRhfczaa	Have you explained to him exactly why you think it would be good to have kids now? Has he explained to you why he wants to wait?<br>  <br>  This is something that can really only be solved by an open conversation. I think you need to be careful about pushing him into something he doesn't want, especially so early in your marriage. Don't go into the conversation determined to 'persuade' him - just be honest.|`|ApxlKQVNaa	I am in same boat....alot to do with current economic climate<br>  <br>  However I am concerned If things dont work down there we will be wasting time<br>  <br>  I also get the impression that he will want to when his closer mates go down that road but I dont think things like that should be influenced cos others are doing it... What are his reasons? My other half goes thru different stages of broodyness which irriatates me as I never know where I am, however you know what, its about the BOTH of you and not just him (This applies to me too!) <br>  <br>  Had you discussed kids before you married? Feel free to PM me :) <br>  <br>  Men huh??<br>  <br>  PS I married a month after you!|`|9U37oyMsaa	I had to beg and beg my husband and he has agreed to only wait 8 months. We got pregnant by accident in dec. and miscarred 2/26/09. I wanted to try again right away but he wanted to wait a year or 2. just beg and beg and don't start being mean doesn't help lol! Good luck!!|`|dMv8X2nIaa	Not sure how old you are but: You can try and explain to him that a womens reproductive system starts acting up around age 35, some cases 30. Explain to him if you wait too long, when he is finally ready you may run into possible fertility problems. Also a man has a biological clock too which starts about the same time as us women, but its not as drastic or fast as womens.   I got Pg very easily 6 times, but  i had 2 misc.'s in 2001, a 3rd very end of 2002-2003..got PG with my son shortly after that misc.2003 he was born 2003...got PG again 2005 and misc.'d...only reason there are some distants between these was i was off n on BCP..i wasnt very good at taking them..after leaving my son's father i went 3 years be4 TTC again..1st try last July17th i got a BFP with my DH..but sadly it was in my tube...I am only 26..was 21 when i had my son...so ihave 5 angel babys and only one child...and impatiently trying since Nov. and no luck, i get fertility drugs next week....I dont want to scare you..but just want to let you know...He needs to decide wether he wants children or not and that its NOT as easy as it all seems...some ppl think you have sex and get Pg....not the case with every1. I really hope he changes his mind...I love being a Mommy ,even though my son is a handful, but honestly i would love to just keep having kids until i go into menopause,lol. But that good old money issue stands in the way and always will. We will be thankful for one more child but at the most we will be trying for a 3rd, once i get the 2nd :) the other things these ladies posted are alos good ideas, just dont let it ruin ur marriage...|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Try to bring yourselves into contact with some people who have nice kids.  Steer clear of ones with obnoxious kids.|`|7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	I can understand your situation. Men become very selfish on this Baby issue. Just tell him that you want an early baby, and then that's it. And that you envision yourself and your husband as being in the role of parenthood... and when it will happen a day, then why not now.. when I want it so badly. <br>  Have a cute baby's poster in your bedroom... and gather some cute fluffy toys and decorate them. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't get convinced.. then I would go for some 'silent treatment'... and not always ready to have sex. Just be respectful and all... but not overly-done behaviors.
hlWdFTcjaa	Ive only been TTC for my first for three months and its already driving me crazy! Hehe! I was 11 days late last month and really believed that it was for really but then day 12 period decides to turn up! I was sooooo gutted but just enjoying the "trying" part of it. And if its not your month this month (I hope it is though!) just try and relax and enjoy the time with your partner! Good luck though hun! **~~BABY DUST~~** x|`|F3k2omZGaa	I really hope that you are pregnant!!!! I've been trying for over a year now and it feels like it is NEVER going to happen!! I never thought it would be so hard!! Me and my husband have been taking Fertilaid for a month now, so i'm hoping that works, it has helped me ovulate on my own so it seems like it's working lets just hope that it gets me pregnant!! I always heard it is easier to get pregnant if you already have a baby because you're preoccupied with that baby so you're not concentrating on getting pregnant so there's no stress! But that's just what i've heard! I reallly hope you are pregnant, best wishes!!! If you are, let me know so i can tell you congrats!.........BABY DUST.|`|EWHWPC2Taa	yes me to! i think alot of women are feeling about the same as you now, this is the first month that i am trying to concieve it seems stressful to me but hey if it happens it happens, if it does not then meny more happy hours trying!<br>  <br>  good luck and god bless xx|`|pLoD2hm3aa	hi there,<br>  im praying im preg,me n my bf have been ttc for 2years now for our first baby! i defo ovulated this month cuz had a blood test done n im clomid 100mg, so im hopeing i am!! im due on any day now! wish me luck!!<br>  p,s good luck 2 u 2 darling! xx|`|1Hrlhx7qaa	me too i'm  nearly a week late since I last tested i got a BFN on the day my period was due|`|FgKTgJiLaa	i fell exactly the same i have a 2 year old. and i recently got married and my husband really wants a baby of his own. So we have been tryin constanly and everytime i get my period i am so sad like i let him down. it kills me, we've tried everything. i was really hoping that i was pregnant this month but mother nature's present came yesterday i was crushed. All i can think about is baby, baby, baby!|`|YGcmAbHBaa	i to hope im pregnant too.been trying for approx 4months and last month i hardly bled (2days-very very light) and now im waiting two more week til my period is due but iv got a feeling i am pregnant. got the cramps and sickness, and i just got that feeling. im just scared cuz iv got all excited b4 and its been negative, so fingers crossed it positive come the 16th!<br>  <br>  BABY DUST FOR U ALL xXx|`|BlPJw4iAaa	me too. Never been on any type of pill, ever. Thought it would be much easier to get pregnant. Been trying for 6 months now, no sign as yet. AF due today, nothing as yet, but crossed fingers. Count yourself lucky you at least have one child already! Good luck, lots of babay dust to you!
aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	No, there's nothing illegal about that.<br>  <br>  Kids much younger than that are on facebook and myspace and there's no laws about who can contact each other that I know of.<br>  <br>  I would've loved my Mom to contact me at an earlier age, it would've answered some of the sackful of questions I've been holding onto much sooner|`|xKSr1ld8aa	In the UK it depends on whether it is a closed or open adoption.<br>  <br>  If it's closed then contact shouldn't bemade until the adopted person is 18 but occasionally it happens before then but I've never heard of anybody making a big deal if contact has been made.<br>  <br>  Open adoptions - it depends on the agreement but usually it's not a problem.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Nope. Like Indy said, her adoptors may stomp their feet and make a bunch of noise, but there's not a whole lot they can do legally, esp since she's almost 18.  They could get a restraining order to block you, but it would make them look like selfish idiots. She's almost 18. Go for it.|`|bYrGGOynaa	It depends what is in your contract. Contact the adoption agency you worked with.|`|bvANHTbEaa	No, as long as the custodial parent(s) consents to the meeting. Hey, who knows, maybe she wants to meet you, too!|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Doubt it.....although the adopter can make an issue out of it.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Hi, EternalSerenity!<br>  <br>  I am guessing you are her first mother?<br>  <br>  Technically, since adoption renders the biological parents "legal strangers" to their offspring, there is no specific law preventing contact. In the US, we have "freedom of association"; which would support your right to contact (barring any restraining order or other court order demanding otherwise). However, if the child is under 18, the APs do have the right to take out a restraining order if they consider the contact to be "harassment" and can convince a Judge that it is in their best interest to have one. (I would be kind of curious to see how a Judge would handle a case like this, especially with an older child who has the legal right to make their wishes known to the Court. In most states, the age that a child may speak for themselves in Court is age 12.)<br>  <br>  Of course, the courteous and probably the best thing would be to contact the APs too and get their support and "blessing"or wait until the child is 18. Not that I need to tell you, but being respectful of others is usually the best way to get respect for yourself and makes the foundations for stronger and more meaningful relationships.<br>  <br>  I wish you the very best in contacting your daughter. I hope that you are able to build a happy and healthy relationship with her. I hope you and her APs are able to mutually support one another and come together over/for the daughter you all love.

77fnDYlmaa	They eventually get smarter and start to crawl on their own, so yes.<br>  soon after that (a couple months) they start to stand and eventually start walking.|`|foJm2Yftaa	They eventually learn to crawl on their own, so yes! %Lol%|`|CMzi6Oieaa	yes! and when you let them get mad that is when they do more. the more frustrated they get the faster they learn. she will get mad and eventually learn how to crawl. same as with walking. i feel the best thing to do  is to let her get mad and she will be crawling before you know it.
qxnZXOVFaa	if you take something away from her, give her another toy or something suitable to play with.  at around 9 months, babies can tell when you are gone, so keep talking to her even when you go out of the room.  this is also the time when they start to experience separation anxiety, so reassure her that you are coming back and do so in a timely manner.  you can start to stretch the time in which you are gone little by little, but your baby is learning to trust you and knowing that you are there for her is a big deal right now.  good luck!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	I believe that she is at the age when they start experiencing separation anxiety which is completely annoying and normal|`|tx8OTfFUaa	My 9 month old just started this!  How perplexing.  I tried not to spoil him, but I think he may be just a little bit.  He has his own play cell phone and remote, but guess what, he wants the good remote and our cell phones.  He grabbed one last night and I took it and you should have seen the fit this kid threw!  He could have won an oscar.  <br>  <br>  My son sounds exactly like your daughter.  He is doing the same things and it just started all of the sudden.  I talked to his Dr and he laughed and said that would be him knowing his mommy really well.  He knows that I pick him up whenever he cries and low and behold, he is right.  It's certainly a phase.  If she is not running a fever, getting a tooth, wet/poopy or hungry, she is just getting used to cause/effect.  I cry, mommy comes...smart little suckers, aren't they!!|`|1HHgP3WCaa	this is a stage that all children that age go through.  This is when they see how far is my mom, or dad willing to go?  Oh they pick me up when I cry, What I can play with what ever I like?  Scold her when she throws a fit, and don't  pick her up everytime she cries, and you shall slowly see an improvement; But remember it will get worse before it gets better. Good luck.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  thanks<br>  <br>  <br>  Debra H.|`|foJm2Yftaa	Its normal. Shes growing up. Eventually she'll understand. %Lol%|`|YP1DXbBDaa	The wanting you, even if her Dad his holding her is part of normal development-babies develop separation anxiety...it's part of the breakthrough where they learn that things exist even when you can't see them...so for example, if you put a toy under a blanket and cover it up, they're beginning to learn that the same toy exists when you uncover it, and that it's not magically a new or different toy when you remove the blanket.  She's learning to trust you and that you'll come back and that you exist even when she can't see you.<br>  <br>  And the fussing when you take things away is also normal.  She's learning to express her preferences or desires in the only way she can right now-by throwing a fit when you take something away.  As she begins to gain language skills through talking or signing if you do baby sign language with her, and skills like pointing and gesturing, some of this may become less frustrating because she'll be able to tell you what she wants and needs.  For now, when you take things away from her you want to distract and redirect-offer something safe to replace whatever she shouldn't have and get her involved with that.|`|CMzi6Oieaa	yep all the joys of parenting! they change so much first they don't really care and then they become very needy, before you know it she will be so independent that when you try to hold her she will tell you that she wants down. she is at the age where she gets mad when she isn't getting her way. it is perfectly normal.|`|p3cOp5yeaa	This is completely normal and right on time!  Click on the link below for info.  Just keep offering her reassurances and patience and it will pass.  Hang in there...|`|ZCDThZ4paa	she growing up and yes it is ok for her to act like this|`|9P6Kp8PKaa	I think its ok just teach her. Your a Mom and all you need to do is show her that she cant have it.

Ccq8zEcnaa	You can take a test as early as 20-24 days after unprotected sex. After 30 days the results are much more accurate. So you should be able to test by the end of March.. or you can go to the doctor and get a blood test. You may start getting symptoms as early as 3 weeks along.|`|zSABr7praa	Where were you in your cycle?  Many women ovulate around the last 10-14 days of their cycles.  When it's time to take the "white pills", and your period doesn't come, take a test.  If your on a seasonal pill, it'd wait three weeks then test.|`|FKf67HXaaa	I know on the pregnancy test you should take it 3-4 days before your missed period and not everyone has symptoms. I didn't have any signs at all, I found out I was pregnant in my fourth month because of weight gain|`|vZwJyqc6aa	You may or may not have symptoms. Take the test on the day you are SUPPOSED to get your period. You should be keeping track of your cycle even if you aren't getting periods.|`|cfdooGylaa	Take a test in 2 weeks.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	take one the next time your due a period|`|sJUhwxBxaa	If you missed your pill for long enough that you started bleeding, you can take a test in two weeks. Otherwise, I would recommend taking one soon, and then once a week for four week (that is, until you get one that's positive.) I got pregnant on the pill and didn't get a positive test until I was six weeks pregnant. Good luck!<br>  <br>  By the way, symptoms can show up as early as two weeks in, or not show up at all until you start showing. Some women never have morning sickness or anything.|`|LDiBjNf5aa	If you take a test in 2 weeks, that's the earliest that it MIGHT be accurate. If you wait three weeks and use it first thing in the morning, then it's more likely to be accurate.<br>  <br>  However, if you're really concerned, you could buy multiple tests from the dollar store to keep testing for cheap.
sJUhwxBxaa	Absolutely safe. There is no proof that the chemicals from hair color absorb through human skin. Even if they do, the trace amounts that you would recieve would not likey transfer to your baby.<br>  I would recommend not having a perm/relaxer treatment while pregnant though. It cannot hurt the baby, but with hormonal changes manifesting in the hair, it can wind up looking horrific.|`|bxlYleZkaa	There is a lot of mystique and a lot of rubbish talked about where hair and pregnancy are concerned!!! If you are at all worried about the chemicals used by your hairdresser then don't do it! It is you decision.|`|abT0o6hHaa	coloring your hair is perfectly safe. Your hair folicals are too small for anything to get in|`|hOkmcVeDaa	A couple of my doctors said no way and then some of them said after the second trimester. I dont think they recommend it when your pregnant. My second pregnancy i dyed my hair in my third trimester and also got my nails done in my second and she turned out fine. Ask your doctor and see what they think.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I did it the other day,but I won't do it again while pregnant. With my daughter,I did it constantly. My aunt does mine,and she's a cosmetologist,so I trust her,she uses the dye on me that barely contains ammonia.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	I called my dr before i dyed my hair and they said it was fine. But my hair lady would cover my nose cause she wouldnt want me to smell the fumes. But I didnt dye my hair much when I was prego, only 2 times.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	iv heard its safe but i`m gonna be on the safe side for my own knowledge and just wait until the baby is born.|`|muOdsIv1aa	There is evidence that it does go to the baby. Though the amounts topically (it shouldn't be applied to the skin!) aren't quite as bad as what you will inhale from the vapors. Just read the MS DS sheets for the toxicity and chemical information of the ingredients.  Chances are if you are healthy and your pregnancy is healthy you may not suffer any rare and dangerous side effects. Though be advised your hormones can change the way the chemicals react with your hair and your scalp can be more sensitive to chemical burn. Truth is its a gamble for you and your baby. I didn't know about the risks and did it with my second daughter. It turned out HORRIBLE! The color didn't take in some places, took too well in others.Some of it got on my skin and burned my scalp and I lost a patch of hair!! And that was with a low ammonia, minimal processing, professional job. If I had know I never would have done it.|`|xneu80Uhaa	im no scientist....but it on your hair right so how could it affect the baby? plus like you said there is no proved sceintific evidence howver to be on the safe side and your having youor doubts...hold of till your baby is born, You would rather be safe than sorry.|`|Nux5S6oVaa	It's safe.  Just make sure it's in a well ventilated area, and that you only highlight. (Foils or a pull threw cap keep it off your scalp which decreases absorption!)<br>  <br>  I'm counting down the days till I can get touched up!  I'm 10wks 5days!!<br>  <br>  My doctor says it's fine just not dyeing your whole head!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2V4JHa1Saa	the amonia in the die is not healthy for the baby i am on my 3rd pregnancy and all my docs said dyeing your hair is a biiig no no|`|jcHxLOAXaa	be warned your hair might react differently than usual with being pregnant,  but there is no danger to the baby but i would have a sensitivity test done first incase off a reaction. hope this helps. good luck

An ultrasound will give you a better date though based on your measurements.|`|zSABr7praa	The ultrasounds generally tend to give a pretty accurate due date, and from there you can look up you're conception date.

o3zLlogMaa	just wanting to be pregnant can have the uncanny effect of making aunt flo late so just do a test and know for certain. My periods were clockwork 28 days- until we started trying - then they went anything up to 40 days a complete nightmare when ttc. If you keep having problems get ovulation sticks from ebay, it took me 5 months to catch using these! ...Good luck x|`|QBZRtwH3aa	I think you should give it a couple more days.  If no period by the 8th then you should take a test.|`|erjMAQcAaa	Your period will start on the day your cycle has completed 28 days or however long your cycle is - so you are due to start anytime now.

When the cervix starts changing (softer, thinner, more open) the mucus can fall out or loosen.<br>  <br>  Since it is getting softer, labor can be getting close, but some women can have a soft cervix, be effaced, or even dilated for several weeks.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Kd1pt6dFaa	a soft cervix does not mean it is thinning out..  your cervix has to ripen in order for it to start effacing and dilating..  the ripening of your cervix is the softening...

(if that's what you wanted)|`|9lT4e8Efaa	you totally have a point! what a scumbag! If he can't even be bothered to help you through this, he really isn't worth you worrying about. Get a friend or family member to go with you for support and forget about this guy. If you were planning on keeping the baby he would prob be even less supportive, cut all contact with him and don't even think about him again he doesn't deserve your thoughts! I hope everything goes well for you, and you meet someone better x|`|BlPJw4iAaa	I agree with you, it takes two to tango. He should go with you, but if I was you, Id leave him be. You've asked him to come with you and hes decided that its "too expensive". Leave him be. I know that if I had the support from family/ friends that I would feel more comfortable with them being there with me. Let him feel useless, and let him live with this in his conscience. I think your right choosing to go ahead with the termination, as you have other things on your plate at the moment. Others may try and put you off with all the blah blah blah, but I think your doing the right thing. (Hard for me to say, as Im married, and trying for a baby at the moment, but circumstances with other people are different) Good luck!|`|hlWdFTcjaa	You are defiantly not being petty but be prepared, he may not want to go with you. And you cant force him either. If he refuses, go with a close friend or even a family member. And make sure you have given yourself enough time to think about if this is the right decision for you. Even though this is 100% your choice, be ready for some nasty comments on here. Just warning you hun, but ignore the nasty people and just make sure you are happy with what you chose! Good luck chick with whatever you decide to do! x<br>  <br>  EDIT: I didnt see that he thought it was too expensive to travel down! He is a waste of space! Get someone who actually cares about you to come with you and who can be there for you and comfort you! x|`|FgKTgJiLaa	quite honestly i am not tryin to preach to your or anything. BUt think about the abortion before you do it, i had one when i was about your age and now it's almost impossible for me to have a child. So that one decision that  i made now my husband now has to suffer for it. I think you should really think about it.|`|czWfYxDJaa	I don't feel that you are being petty by no means. You are very right. You and him did it together and together you should deal with that responsibility. I'd tell him that your not making him father the child nor will he ever have to pay child support, the least he could do is go with you. Once it's done, it's done and he can go about his merry way. Until then, he need to take responsibility and do what he can to support you and the decision you are making.
d5b50df4239d050a07a008ef4c3efc3caa	1st thing, you need to talk to your boyfriend.  If thats the way it is going to be, it is only going to get worse when the baby comes!

I work 11-7 and he works 2-10 at a bar and grill so when he gets off i'm going to work so he just stays up there and drinks with the money he should be saving to have a baby! I get so frustrated that i'm left working, sleeping and preparing while he's out having a good time. SO..I talked to him about it... That's what you should do. I found out that he had actually been saving money and that he is just as stressed out as me about having a baby and that's why he parties with his friends, it's easier than facing the fact that he's going to be a dad, which was unplanned. He's now doing a lot better with only going out once a week and if more including me in activities. My doc. said that most guys don't take on the dad role until the baby is actually here, there's a different connection since we are carrying the baby... Keep your head up, have a chat with him and CONGRATS!|`|ZVUrLZpXaa	You need to work out your problems before that baby arrives--talk about stress.You will find a whole new meaning of the word after the child's birth--sleepless nights,dirty diapers,feeling that a daily shower is a 'luxury',etc...|`|cc0IPV6Iaa	Tell your husband what you think about his behavior and attitudes.

Don't try to assume how I feel!<br>  If you CARE FOR ME, sit down with me for a minute & listen to what i'm saying please.<br>  <br>  But then again he could also be feeling any way about the pregnancy..<br>  Ask him how he feels & don't try to overcrowd him or force yourself on him.|`|mnaNKujPaa	It will get worse when the baby comes - deal with his behaviour now! He is being inconsiderate and clearly isn't facing up to his responsibilities.

In the meantime keep busy to relieve the stress.|`|lc57ntoFaa	Ya know what, my husband did the same thing. I sat him down one day, and explained to him that it wasn't fair to me, that I sit at home all alone, or have to go pick his drunkass up. I just told him how I felt. He cut back A LOT.

pNKBszseaa	no, it will actually help you. If you are married, your boyfriend (husband) will receive Medicaid for himself. and because you have a baby in common that helps too. I have to have Medicaid for my daughters because the eldest suffers from vesicoretial reflux (kidney) and no insurance company will pick her up due to a pre existing condition. it has been rough, but i thank god for Medicaid.

The best thing for you to do is speak with someone at the Medicaid office and ask if you would still be quilified.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Yes my friend lost hers when she married. And when you marry you will have to reapply for everything. You will get food stamps together instead of separate and it will be less. You may also lose certain benefits. Do they even know that you live the same household because they can cut you out for that if you didn't inform them before you applied. Anytime your situation changes you have to reapply and risk losing it all.|`|YMN6q1Cgaa	The best would be not to get married until you have the baby or he's 18 at least. <br>  The thing is, why not wait a little bit first.

Any way, I don't really think so, but your medical coverage / care provider and look into it.<br>  <br>  But anyhow, congrats and good luck on the marriage and future kid.|`|kg18TbsGaa	no it will not affect your medicaid or food stamps.. i have had medicaid and food stamps since i was 16 and i'm now 19 it just depends on your income .. right now they will give you food stamps and medicaid because your pregnant but after since your working 2 jobs and your boyfriend also works you guys might make a little too much and also you only stay with medicaid 3 months after babys born but you will have medicaid for the rest of your pregnancy and dr's visit if you already have it right now.|`|ulhyTxoGaa	i think it depends on the state.<br>  i believe they will just look at your bf's income, and base it on that.<br>  <br>  in my area, if you have a child and you are unable to afford doctor visits, and make under $18,000 a year, then you can still get medicaid.<br>  <br>  just call and talk to your social worker about it.|`|yrWiTdXfaa	no, you wont lose your medicaid! when i found out i was pregnant, i was engaged with a wedding right around the corner. we checked and double checked to make sure i wouldn't lose my benefits, and the lady told us that marital status didn't matter, and when we got married nothing changed! good luck with everything :)|`|FgKTgJiLaa	if you guys already have medicaid and you guys applied together then i don't think anything would change if you got married because it's the same income and everything|`|A32Aq2h0aa	In your case medicaid is based on the people in the home so you may still get help, plus being pregnantt still receive it till the baby is born.Then the healthy child program should take care of the child after birth.Since you both applied together it should not change, tell your caseworker your plans they will help you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Best wishes it is hard working and being pregnant but it will get better and don't worry what others say they just don't have nothing better to do.
lD0VcAlpaa	You need to take the baby to the ER. The baby is not getting adequate oxygen, which can cause problems now and/or later. Good luck.|`|VUfT35UQaa	That shouldn't happen too much, ask a doctor.<br>  <br>  You turn blue in general because you are not getting oxygen and your blood is deoxygenated and looks blue.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	My daughter sometimes turns blue when she cries hard. It's usually caused by them holding their breath... try blowing in their face to help them catch their breath back. If this happens too often, and if you're that concerned.. contact a doctor.|`|nd5w7v4saa	Your baby might not be breathing the way it is supposed to, while crying hard and long.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe take him or her to the doctor, if you get too concerned.<br>  <br>  But just like when there drinking , the grasp for air, and they get it, just not that much of it.|`|hE4CXKX2aa	Well at that young young age, I really can't say.  But take the baby to a doctor and find out.  Maybe there could be some form of "lack of oxygen".|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	Because it's sad. :'(|`|TJusfEnlaa	troll -|`|foJm2Yftaa	It's not that common for babies to get so worked up, but it's that uncommon either.<br>  <br>  My aunt was telling me that my cousin used to get so worked up and wouldn't breath when he cried that he would just pass out. Very scary. The doctor told her he'd grow out of it, of course that was 20 years ago.<br>  <br>  You should mention it to your doctor so that he can give you some tips on how to deal with it and to ease your mind, because I can't imagine how scary that must have been.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11184105	That baby is NOT getting enough oxygen!<br>  <br>  Call a doctor and have the doc run tests starting with his heart.|`|XGx9WORLaa	get that baby to a doctor or ER that is not right or healthy. He is having a lack of oxygen Don't wait til it is too late|`|WSddlMS8aa	you need to take your baby to the doctor asap....that's a good sign your child is not getting enough oxygen.|`|bwoVogaOaa	not getting enough oxygen.|`|iIWwZrvEaa	no. go straight to the doctor. now,please.|`|DQjokuEmaa	it cant breathe!!!!!!!!!!!!
0GqYeMVWaa	hey honey,calm down.firstly ignore the silly cow who said those nasty things(she should be ashamed of herself.and has clearly never been in this situation) you must go to a doctor and get advice from him/her.they are the experts and will not persuade you either way on your decision.16 is really young to have a child and its incredibly hard work(im not patronizing you)..if you have an abortion,thats absolutely fine,it is your body and you dont need negative answers from people with no life experience.good luck.i wish i could help you more(i am a mother of a 13yr old girl) .make that appointment,dont wait around.xxxx|`|PS91d0wvaa	If you live in Canada, it is for free. But it is illegal to have an abortion if your are more than 12weeks pregnant, I know I had one when I was 15 (I am now 23) and the laws haven't changed. It was the smartest thing I chose to do at that time because what kind of life can you give your child if you don't even have one? They only give abortions under 12 weeks because it is still considered an embryo, not a functioning foetus yet ( they will educate you on this at the clinic). I also know this because I am now 26 weeks along with my first daughter! :) And have read lots of books and been to babycenter.,com and check the development everyday because I am so excited! You will have to have an ultra sound first, to determine how far along you are. If you are over 12 weeks, your choice is then adoption, which in your case is probably a good idea, because you are only 16 years old and you have your whole life ahead of you. It is controversial with abortions because it is a form of life. I understand this if you are more than 12 weeks, but it is only a fertilized egg when an abortion is given ( in canada at least ) And yes I know this for sure because it is taken very seriously, and you are put through psychiatric evaluation afterwards to make sure you are not depressed or suicidal about it. They educate you on every aspect of what will happen and what you are doing. Call your local hospital and ask for the women's clinic, ( that's what it is in Canada ) and make an appointment, they will help as best they can. Good luck hun, take care of yourself!|`|kT7GVOosaa	yes you need an appointment. and after you make that appointment you should make another one to learn how to keep your legs shut. while your getting that abortion I hope you think about if your mother had aborted you or the one you love was aborted. your killing your own flesh and blood. at 3 weeks your baby has a heartbeat. murder is making the heart stop and that is what you ar edoing to you own child.|`|GopaUZOJaa	ok i know it might seem like the worst option now, but talk to a parent, teacher, friend anyone. Abortion is usually not the best answer, someday you'll look back and you'll be like 'if i only had that baby it would be 5 and going to kindergarten' you'll wish you had gone through. There are tons of families waiting to adopt.|`|QP46eVi4aa	wow it is funny how many irresponsible people not just teens think it is fun to have sex and get knocked up and then have your child pulled out of you and let them abort it <br>  <br>  sorry i am upset i have seen this queston way to many times <br>  <br>  but i would say tell mommy and daddy and she what they say <br>  <br>  but dang if you are not old anoth to take responsibility for your problems then stay out of doing things that are meant for people who are wise anoth and smart anoth to take care of there self and the baby that sex was intended to create<br>  <br>  and about birth control you know that stuff is not completely secure the best thing to do is not have sex before you catch something more then a pregnancy like something water will not wash off|`|w4CISs9paa	No, you don't. Want you need is to give your baby a chance at life, just like you got.|`|sbEY601saa	call planned parenthood. <br>  <br>  and with your age i think you dont need somebody, but i can be wrong. <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|MRV9rNyjaa	call planned parent hood. that is all im gonna say so i dont sound like a mean person! im biting my tounge!!|`|BJugETlOaa	You need to tell your parents about this, if you are old enough to get pregnant you are old enough to be responsible and tell your parents. I will not go into the please don't get an abortion speech, but I wish you wouldn't Adoption is a great thing, there are so many people out there that would love to have a child including myself.|`|vGxipYJnaa	You need an appointment. You have to have at least one appointment before the actual abortion just to make sure your pregnancy is normal.<br>  <br>  You should go to planned parenthood - you don't need a parent in most states but you need someone to drive you home. If you qualify for medicaid it could cost only about $60 (including the pre-abortion check up), but could run you up to about $500 depending on where you live.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	no one needs an abortion in a hurry. It is a decision to be thought out. Ask your parent for help.|`|kGO4ZhtQaa	if u go to ur doctors u can get it free i think (in the uk) i dont think u need a parent with u.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	not the best section to ask this question in.|`|BLbZVvejaa	Hi<br>  Email me TaelorHolman09@yahoo.com<br>  I have some info you need
LeaUjOoUaa	When you take birth control pills, it basically changes your cycle. When you began taking the pill, it was putting hormones in your body that would keep you from having a period. This is why the pill comes with placebo pills to take for a week so you have a period. What happens is bleeding begins because of the decline in those hormones. When you stopped taking the pill, the bleeding you experienced was from this drop in hormones. Your bodies own natural cycle has been messed with from this week of hormone suppliments. It may take a bit of time for you to go back to a normal cycle. Consider the bleeding you had as a period and calculate from there. If you bled for about a week from the 7th, then you would be at day 24 of your cycle. Most women have a 28 day cycle and are considered late if they go five days past. So if you haven't started a period by the 14th of this month, then I would take another pregnancy test. Even then it might not come exactly when you would expect it but this happens when your cycle gets interrupted. Same thing goes when one gets pregnant. It can take some time before periods start up again due to hormones and other conditions. Try to take it easy. If your instincts tell you that you are pregnant, treat yourself as though you are until you know different.|`|NVVTTwm4aa	u r not pregnant...simple
6nUprmu5aa	I don't trust my kids with adults even unless they are certified caretakers. But not everyone is like me, although I don't think many people would leave their kids alone with you. (The Babysitter's club is NOT reality). You could watch just family and friends, and have adults present.|`|lFlapW8maa	not i|`|ZjXd1JVIaa	the 16 year old could try camp bernie day camp as a cit or counceler. <br>  <br>  u get free room and board. <br>  <br>  and ull c me there. <br>  HA.|`|kRt9Dq7gaa	A bunch of teens taking care of small children. Personally I wouldn't.
r7q8LW7Aaa	I loved breastfeeding and was distraught when my baby refused to feed anymore. It's the best cuddle ever and it's an experience for just the two of you that no-one else can share.<br>  ADD - Not that I give a crap, but where's the logic in thumbing down when I answered it honestly and without offending anyone? lol|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I love to breastfeed my daughter. The first few weeks were tough, but now I can't imagine it any other way. Being able to nurse her has created an extremely special bond between us.|`|cezWu0Wnaa	Do I like it? It was almost like an euphoric experience for me in the first night but after that no way, specially when I have to wake up the middle of the night. But would I trade it for formula feeding, no way. Breastmilk is the best food for an infant so I'll be the provider till he turns 1 year. Once you become a mom you start thinking more about your baby than about yourself, that's the plain truth.|`|MQ34YW28aa	I wasn't able to actually breastfeed because my son wouldn't latch on, so had to pump which I hated. I had to stop because of medical reasons anyways. But a lot of moms enjoy it and it's great for the baby.|`|w3ob12X6aa	there are so many reasons why i love it for one its bonding with my baby, it doesn't cost anything ,its very convenient for me. my daughter is 3 months old and she is exclusively breastfeeding|`|6lyvhRLsaa	I love it! Its killing me knowing I have to give my baby a bottle when I go back to work.|`|AA11615972	Overall, I would say yes. There are some wonderful things about it and there are some not so wonderful things about it. With both kids, the first couple weeks I was sore, that sucked. Also, my kids never would take a bottle, so not being able to leave them with anyone has been hard. But, it has totally been worth it. I love the bonding. I love that I am doing the best thing for my daughters. I love how it feels to know you are nourishing your baby. plus, I love the convenience of not having to carry around formula, bottles, water,etc...everywhere I go. Most of all, I love it because it is the most beautiful intimate thing.|`|fvmKx667aa	I absolutely hated it at first cause we tried everything and she wouldnt latch. I had to use a nipple shield and also pump and give bottles. It took almost 2 months before we were able to get rid of shield and I was no longer in pain. Now I like the convenience. Night feedings are great cause we can both lay in bed and be comfy while she nurses. It is a great bonding experience but I am sure I would have found other ways to bond if I had given up!|`|lD0VcAlpaa	I personally love it, it makes me feel closer to my son. I went through a period when my milk wasn't coming in (TMI?) and had to supplement formula, which wasn't my favorite. If you don't breastfeed though, don't feel bad, as long as your baby is getting nutrients and food somewhere (breast or bottle), that's all that counts. :)|`|bebe9c739d0b1ba65bd5c996c40ee2eaaa	I love breastfeeding. Its very relaxing, its free and very good for the baby. My baby drinks formula during the day at daycare, when hes at home and during the weekends, he just nurses as much as he wants. <br>  <br>  I have a friend who thinks its "too much" (of course she never breastfed), its the best experience ever!|`|8NJM0NVvaa	I love it.  I love how close it makes me feel to my son and I think it has made me have a much closer relationship with my daughter.  Also I like knowing that I am all he needs to be healthy.  It is great.
o72Ng7IRaa	I have 3 girls: 6, 4, and 9 mos. Fortunately i didn't experience the terrible two's with my older daughters. Whatever you do, don't entertain his tantrums too much (or don't let him know that you're entertaining them). Make sure he doesn't put himself in physical danger and let him know that you don't like that type of behavior and that you will have to turn away from him until he stops. On the flip side, make sure you thank him when he doesn't resort to tantrum behavior, "Here's your snack. Thank you for being patient and not crying and screaming. i like it when you behave like this."|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	its called the terrible two's for a reason. hes testing his limits with you and you probably need to discipline him for it before he thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.|`|qayCggxMaa	2nd molars are a likely culprit - they come in around 2 years old.  It can be kind of suprising because your child probably hasn't teethed in 6 months or more and so you don't think about it.  My son turned quite grouchy and clingy for 2 weeks and wasn't eating or sleeping well - and after all that I was very disappointed that only 1 of the molars came in... I had thought it was at least both bottom ones.
kaqPSgTVaa	I think you should stop worrying about it and talk to your doctor when he goes in for his year check up. The first year can vary greatly with development.|`|cv0foxlTaa	I wouldn't worry about it.  My son is 12 months old and has only been clapping his hands for a month.  He knows how to wave hi/bye but doesn't always do it.  He doesn't have any words yet.<br>  <br>  He sounds normal, and you sound normal (a worried parent - aren't we all? haha).<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned about it, bring it up at your son's 12 month check-up but I'm sure he's fine.  As long as he interacts with you and babbles, etc.|`|AA10371609	Early signs of autism are/include:<br>  <br>  Not making faces back at you.<br>  Not imitating sounds you make.<br>  Not interacting with you.<br>  No idle chatter i.e. baby noises for no reason.<br>  Completely stopping all progress/learning suddenly.<br>  <br>  Your baby sounds fine.  He's just still learning social skills.  If you're really concerned talk to your peditrician on your next visit.  But, in all likelyhood, your baby is just fine.|`|Ac4ny8DGaa	It’s really too early to diagnose, but even if it weren’t, these are normal for his age.|`|o72Ng7IRaa	I agree with Due. I wouldn't worry just yet. From what you've described, he seems to just develop faster physically.
NDQS5HJyaa	Oh my gosh, my daughter looks SO FREAKING GOOD in purple. Like... you have no idea.

I only have 8 weeks to go and I am counting down the days to feel like myself again|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Urhg first I had bigger breasts. But I was already  D and went to a DD. No big deal. Then my belly started to grow. Again no big deal, Just had what looked like a small basketball. Well now im 6 months and my belly is huge, and my legs are getting bigger to where I cant wear ANY of my clothes anymore..and it sucks. I was really depressed. But see ive never been skinny, always a size 9 or 11. But now when I go shopping to the mall or something I just see all the new hot clothes there coming out with and hot new styles and I cant wear them, I just have to look plain right now. But after I thought about it I would rather "be big n healthy" then be smaller and be told I need to gain more weight. Plus curves always look better then bones...<br>  <br>  lol anyways just remember right now its about the baby..u can always get sexy again|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	I actually felt more like a woman.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	it is jsut my tummy and i dont like it|`|5WYeHh0paa	Well when the morning sickness and hormones started kicking in, and I felt EXTRA pregnant, I kept thinking who am i? I was an emotional mess, I was mean and a brat, I had no energy I was depressed. OMG it seemed horrible. Now i'm 25 weeks and my boobs are growing, my legs, my belly goes somewhat far and I cant even see my pubes. LOL Gosh I wasn't upset just a little frustrated. I haven't felt "pretty" yet but I do feel more womanly. When I look in the mirror, I honestly think " I cant wait till its over!" <br>  <br>  hahha, god bless and good luck.<br>  im sure your still beautiful. I know it doesn't feel like it but you are!|`|cO9sxO9raa	I know what you mean girly, my hormones were going crazy even before I was showing and I thought I looked horrible. I remember the day before Thanksgiving I was trying to find something to wear and just sat on the floor bawling my eyes out because I thought my stomach was huge (I wasn't even showing yet lol my husband was so confused poor thing didn't know what to do with me). Now at 8 months my stomach is getting bigger by the second but I know this blessing is worth it I'll just have to work extra hard to get rid of this extra "loveliness" after our baby girl is born. =)|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	It's a big change isn't it?

kaqPSgTVaa	If you know that the implant can cause spotting why are you freaking out about spotting...You are spotting because of the impant....Seriously. You said so yourself.<br>  <br>  Also implantation occurs 4-16 days after ovulation. MOST women don't get implantation bleeding (it's usually brown, FYI) and if you didn't get it the first two pregnancies it's unlikely you would get it with any other.<br>  <br>  It's not implatnation bleeding. It's breakthrough bleeding.
YYNpbvpeaa	I have a son that was born Dec 12 '08. He holds his head up, scoots around in his crib (he will wake up in a totally different spot than where I put him!), bats at toys when they are dangled over him, watches t.v (my daughter loves Dora, Backyardigans, etc. and he LOVES the bright colors), follows objects/people with his eyes, eats about 4-5 oz of formula every 3-4 hours when he isn't sleeping for long intervals (he sleeps about 4-6 hours twice a day, sometimes a few little 1 or 2 hours naps in between), and he has just progressed to eating the 1st baby foods. He was eating LOTS of formula, and still not quite satisfied, so I tried ceral first. Constipation took up about a week of my life, so I moved over to applesauce, pears, sweet potatoes, carrots (no meats for a while) and he is doing fabulous! He eats from a spoon like he was born to do it! He doesn't push food out with his tongue, he wraps his little mouth around the spoon, and he can even move the food around in his mouth. He just can't sit up by himself in the highchair yet. One thing I thought he was a little behind on is that he doesn't enjoy tummy time at all, he screams furiously until I flip him back over.|`|w3ob12X6aa	my daughter is 3 months old today. and she is pushing herself up a little at tummy time,smiling and kinda laughing, she copys me when i stick my tongue out, she does a lot of babbling and coos, she just started to do this screaming thing and its so funny because after she does it and makes a face like she didnt know she could yell that loud lol, kicks and moves her legs soo much. she started sleep longer through the night not to long ago which is great and thats about it|`|lD0VcAlpaa	My son will be 3 months on the 13th. He is babbling, will push up off of his tummy with his arms (though he still screams, he hates being on his tummy), he's starting to pre-teeth (a traumatic experience, thus far), sleeping through the night, ah-gah-giggle, smile, really focus on faces. I think he's right on schedule, but remember every baby develops at their own pace! :)

If you want to disinfect it - steam.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	I use the clorox wipes and then a wet paper towel to clean my son's.  It works really well and is so easy that I can do it every day.
AA11615972	just stop feeding her at night. After six months, nutritionally speaking babies do not need to eat in the middle of the night, unless they are underweight. Go to her, soothe her, rock her, do whatever you need to to calm her down and get her back to bed, but do not offer her a bottle or your breast (if you are breastfeeding).  My daughter did this until she was 11 months old. I finally stopped feeding her. I went to her and calmed her down but wouldnt feed her. The first night, she cried for 20 minutes, the second night, she cried for 10 minutes, the third night, she whimpered in her sleep for a second and put herself back to sleep (i didnt even have to go to her room). Since then she has slept through the night. NEVER had a problem again! It's a few rough nights..but, it's totally worth it. If you hang in there and tough it out you will be glad you did!|`|F7i4heAcaa	You could try putting her too sleep earlier. I know it sounds strange but if you get them to sleep earlier they sleep longer. At least that's what worked for my 4 month old. A full belly does not make a child sleep through the night either.|`|FU5vYxflaa	I have 8 kids and just don't overfeed them. especially before night.|`|PbBWJGsTaa	That's my 10 month old's exact sleeping pattern, and I can tell you from my experience, it has nothing to do with her having a full belly.  I think it has more to do with them waking up when they go into light sleep, at old feeding times.  Mine used to need milk every 4 hours overnight.  She no longer needs the milk, but still wakes up and needs to be cuddled back to sleep at those times.  Sometimes, she sleeps through, but most of the time not.  I also put mine in bed with me at the early morning wake-up.  From what i've read, alot of babies have a very similar pattern.  Personally, sleep deprived as I am, i've gotten so used to getting up (takes an hour sometimes to get her back to sleep), that I just plan on doing it till she grows out of it.  She will she will she will...|`|Svgc3izpaa	Your baby is not ready to sleep through the night,  everyone talks of sleeplessness with babies.  Haven't you heard the stories?   Both my babies went through it it was the worst at 9 months for both of mine, they are teething and growing.   <br>  <br>  Every few months your baby is having growth spurts even if you don't see it.  They still need more to eat all the time.  You do have to increase what they eat.  And they will need to eat often.  They are growing!<br>  <br>  Please realize this is not a problem it is natural.<br>  <br>  Love your baby.  Take a deep breath.  She is ONLY 7 MONTHS old.  Don't forget.|`|7f95288915eb0a08046269d6b3d3a16baa	my baby did this too from 6m until she was 9m. I took her for her check up and the doctor said that she should not be getting up to eat and when she does give her a bottle of water and she will stop. I did it that night and it worked she went back to sleep and stopped waking up at night it was super simple I think it only took a night or 2. my doc is a genuis!! My kids are all in that % too. My first baby was 32lbs @ 12m. Now he is super skinny and tall don't worry about it.|`|i071rIOMaa	Try not to over feed her, that can make her tummy hurt. Try just letting her cry it out. I might be the wrong one to ask, I have 8 kids and they all slept with me until they were around 1 1/2.|`|M5qKqlOmaa	give your child warm milk before bedtime..or else play soothing music near Where she sleeps. if neither of these steps work, try speaking to a doctor before it gets worse.<br>  best of luck to you and your child|`|iQjS2lJ4aa	Shes 7 months old, its quite normal for her not to sleep through the night (whatever thats classed as anyway)|`|tAFPbAUaaa	My baby is just turned 11 months old yesterday and she still gets up once a night, usually. She was waking up more than once, but I let her fuss in her bed for a few minutes before getting up to comfort her. Sometimes she will just go right back to sleep. Also, another thing I am doing is instead of offering her a bottle at night, I am giving her a sippy cup of water. Maybe if you try giving her a cup in the middle of the night, she will not wake up as much if she thinks she isn't getting a bottle. Good luck to the both of us! LOL, I have three other children that were all sleeping through the entire night by about 4 months of age.
j2mRop0laa	I absolutely loved home schooling when we did it. My daughter did 2 grade levels in 6 months. We were finished completely and she passed the yearly test (s) with flying colors. We used the rest of the *school* year for taking educational trips, unit studies based on her interests and research / projects. Our lifestyle was much more relaxed.<br>  We had more time to put the kids in activities. They were socializing with other kids on a daily basis. Everyone was shocked we home schooled, because apparently they hear horror stories that kids are not socialized LOL.<br>  <br>  It is a lot of commitment but it isn't as difficult as many people imagine. I would do it again in a heartbeat. However, my oldest is TOO social and wants to be around kids non stop. She wanted to go back to public school. We put her in the grade level with her age group when she actually tested well enough on the placement test to skip a grade. She was pretty bored but made loads of friends on the first day of school. <br>  <br>  I leave it up to her. The education she is getting definitely can't compare to what she could get from home school and home school interest groups- but she likes it.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I love the concept of homeschooling and almost went that route. I didn't because I think I would have missed things along the way. My wife thinks I should have done it. As long as the kids are exposed to all the social aspects in today's society. And you teach them everything they would learn with public education. then it's fine. We have friends that went that route and have done an excellent job . I have also seen what can happen when not all the social skills have developed.|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I think if it done right than it's fine<br>  <br>  I did meet a women that home-schooled.  Her son had a speech problem, I was in speech from age 4 to 19<br>  She did not want to put him in the school district speech program for 3 to 5 year  old, nor would she bring him to a Speech pathologist.  She said she can read a book, and he will be fine<br>  <br>  My daughter been in speech since she was 2, I did speech for years<br>  Reading a book about speech problems, does not make one a speech pathologist.  I thought she was wrong, did not say that, but someone else told me my face did<br>  <br>  Home schooling is fine, as long as the children gets to do things with other children.  If your child has a problem like speech, to get him help for it<br>  <br>  I send my daughter to public school<br>  She get speech, OT, PT and other services at school<br>  I take her to speech and OT out side of school, because she needs more than what the school does.<br>  <br>  I think if you know how to, and have your children around others it's fine.  If you child needs more help, to get it.  Even if the go to public school, and get speech, and you think they need more, you need to do that|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I think there's a third, highly common, far better option, and that's the one I chose. My kids go to private schools. They were bored to tears at their state school, but one would be at war with me within three days if I tried to homeschool her, and the other would rapidly be a professor in the subjects he likes and do the absolute minimum on the others.|`|ZusC87WBaa	I think it's a great option and works wonderfully for some families.  I tried, didn't work so well for us, but I could definitely see where the benefits would be.  I don't buy into all the bull about children losing out on socialization and all that stuff, so I wouldn't give that part of it a lot of thought.  Parents need to do what works best for their children and depending on their individual situations, homeschooling may very well be it.|`|AA12221392	I have actually thought about this due to the ever increasing classrooms and the kids are just not getting as good of a eduction as I would like to see. I also looked at it due to my son and having so many behavioral items happening in school it would save that hassle. the counsler had told me that I would actully due more harm to him, by keeping him away from more public places and also that didn't give him and I a break from each other, which would of made things worse as he would of had worse rage issues and then how could I get him to really learn at that point. <br>  <br>  With our types of children it is a hard descision, because there are even more things to worry about then just the actual education aspect of it. <br>  <br>  if my sons had to spend another year in this middle school, I think I would consider this again very much. I think I would have to take some classes as well to get myself back into the groove of things lol.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	Homeschooling can be fantastic if YOU do your homework (no pun intended :P)<br>  You would have to decide whether you followed a curriculum similar to school or whether you were more interested in child led education..although if course this dosn;t mean letting the child say..I'm not doing anything lol.<br>  I am very lucky to have a small primary school in my village (20 children split between 2 classes of 5-7 yr olds and 8-11 yr olds). My eldest son has Dyscalculia and he is getting all the individual attention he needs, he also had reading problems that would have easily been overlooked in a large school.<br>  I am not considering home school because of this and because he LOVES going to school, its a very cosy environment. But when there was talk of closing the school and busing them to the HUGE school 5 miles away I said I would take him out of mainstream education.  <br>  If you can offer a good level of education and also offer your children a good social life (through evening sports, craft classes and home school networking) then go for it. If you would struggle academically and find it hard to help your child make friends I would consider trying school and finding the smallest friendliest one in your area...you can always remove them if it dosn;t work out :)<br>  Good luck x|`|J2glFOkhaa	If the parent is qualified, then I don't mind it at all. If I could stay home and teach my children I would, however in this economy, my family relies on two incomes. <br>  <br>  I say more power to the moms or dads who can home school. For us, we choose public school. As long as the child gets a good education, I think whatever you choose is fine by me|`|zlGb9NkZaa	a good friend & i are considering getting our kids together & homeschooling them--she'd teach what she's good at & i'd do what i'm good at. i think it'd be great! (i almost became a teacher, btw, but didn't like dealing with 30 kids at once! 4 kids would be easier)|`|2jrffIoWaa	I think it is a great idea, but needs to be done exceptionally well...And the kids need to be involved in outher, outside activities where the parent isn't the main care-giver or instructor.|`|gebIjqnWaa	That depends on the intelligence of the parents. Some are qualified, some are not.|`|R4dcGCVDaa	Much safer then public schools.|`|AA11713801	I, personally, think home schooling is a mistake except in the case of certain kids who have difficulty in social settings, are ostracized due to their physical appearance, or who have certain learning disabilities.<br>  <br>  If you're a trained teacher, that's one thing, but few of us are.  In a school setting, there are teachers with specific strengths and weaknesses.  Few people are good at everything.  Haven't you heard the adage that a team makes better decisions (on average) than one individual?  Well, the same applies to teaching.<br>  <br>  I'm great at math and science, but my English and history are sorely inadequate.  I'm also great at computer science.  My strengths do augment their learning, but do so when they get home from school.  I try to teach them something whenever I see a "teachable" moment and I think you should, too.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I do not believe in organized religions (except, maybe, Unitarianism) so if your goal is to instruct them in a particular faith, I believe you can only polarize their opinions to match your own (instead of letting them develop their own belief).<br>  <br>  Public schools are only partially to credit for schooling our children.  The rest STILL comes from parents who are involved and assist their children in completing their homework and reading in a timely and organized manner.<br>  <br>  Of course, you've also done the very best thing in asking the question in the first place.  That shows you care!|`|z0ro3VkJaa	It can work.<br>  <br>  My math prof home schooled his two daughters, who are about 9 and 12 respectively I believe, and their math skills are somewhere around 4th year undergraduate calculus...<br>  <br>  However, their other levels of education are more age appropriate.<br>  <br>  So it can work really well if you can teach. If you can't teach well, it won't go well. <br>  <br>  Personally, I went through public schools and have no problems with public schools. As such, my kids will be going to public schools.|`|NtFWoBHsaa	creates social misfits.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I am actually going to a meeting tonight on home schooling. I am all in favor of it if the parents are doing it right. Some parents are good with it and some aren't. I plan to give my son the choice if he wants to go to school or not. I don't think public schools are doing such a good job teaching our kids what they need to know. Too much propaganda. Too little actual learning and not enough focus on practical application. So if my son does go to school I will still make sure I teach him all the things he isn't going to get in class.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	if i could home school i would!  Sometimes i like public schools then other times i hate it.  or maybe it's just the rude kids that go to the school i hate and dumb teachers that look the other way when your child tells them there is a problem.  The teacher will say "i didn't see it happen"  That really bugs me!  Do they think that the kid is going to kick the other kid right in front of the teacher for them to see?  I don't think so!  what, are the teachers going to say when a child sees another child with a gun? "i didn't see it"  Things like that bug me.   When a child is getting bullied on and they tell the teacher and the teacher says "i didn't see it happen"  no kidding you didn't see it happen, you weren't supposed to teacher!    <br>  <br>  Can we find other mothers to home school our children??  That would be nice!
CdJtH0xdaa	Who told you that you won't be able to have children? Did a doctor say this to you?<br>  Anyway, you shouldn't tell him, because you're thirteen. If you were sexually active with your boyfriend, and had a stable relationship with him, I'd tell him, but otherwise, there's no need to tell him.|`|Q1PczvzKaa	Tell him you were just being goofy you were laughing so hard you cried.<br>  <br>  Sorry you have to go through this ! :(|`|o3rTWrWPaa	im sorry  but you never know.. ive known a couple of people that wernt "supposed to be able to have kids" and well.. they have kids.<br>  and tell you boyfriend the truth its better than lying about it.|`|kgDH2BILaa	Do what you want, If you feel like you should tell him, do it, if not then don't!

Don't totally flip yet. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I think you should tell you boyfriend because it's not fair to him just because you don't want to tell him. I would have a really hard time being in a relationship with someone if they were hiding something from me like that. So I would say just tell him. There's no excuse to lie.|`|0GqYeMVWaa	how do you possibly know that you might not be able to have kids? have you just come back from the gynaecologist? at 13 yrs old why would this be an issue to you yet?
cezWu0Wnaa	1. I did have to a few buy button down shirts for nursing.<br>  2. Usually all babies like to suckle, it's natural. It takes some time and you have to be patient about it and it takes dedication, seriously! I was sore and dripping milk (and as a result extrely mad at the rest of the world) for almost a week before things settled down between the two of us:-). If that does not work then there's always the option to pump. However your supply will dry up much faster if you depend only on pumping.|`|deIzFnV8aa	In addition to the tank top layered look, which works well, I took some old t shirts and cut off the arms. Then I wear an open button down shirt zip-up sweatshirt over top. Its great for around the house especially - very easy but a little more revealing than the tank top method.<br>  <br>  I know several people who pumped exclusively. It can be difficult since you have  double the time - pumping and giving the bottle. I knew at least one woman though who pumped exclusively for 6 months, so it can be done for sure, just make sure to invest in a good pump in that case.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	1.  I find a button up shirt is the best way to go.  Also any shirt with a wider collar - you would be surprised how many shirts you have that work!  I also wore a tank top to bed to make things easier.  If I were you I would just buy a few shirts, mainly for around the house just so you feel good.<br>  <br>  2.  I am so glad to hear your dedication!  I never really thought about it before I had the baby and it turned out to be a lot harder than I thought.  If you are not determined you may get discouraged - but it does get easier.  Invest in some lanolin spray and also have some nipple covers on hand just in case.  Remember - this is the way nature intended and once you get the kinks worked out it is totally worth it.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!|`|vLOjcH7paa	1. I had to buy some shirts that allowed for breastfeeding; but, I also found I stayed inside a lot and made it through wearing tank tops (which got a little stretched out). I never liked his head being covered by another shirt over him.<br>  <br>  2. Try it! I did. I produced milk for about 12 weeks - it was totally worth it! The pediatrician sd that even a little breastmilk is good bc it gives your baby much needed stuff. Good Luck!! : )|`|6ri7AYC1aa	1)I don't think what you wear should effect breastfeeding. But then again I never breastfeed.<br>  <br>  2)If your son doesn't take to the breastfeeding then yes pumping will be ok(I know plenty of people who pumped). Or another option is going to a lactation specialist they will be able to help if your son is having trouble breastfeeding.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	1.  No I wear my normal clothes<br>  <br>  2.  Exclusive pumping is difficult but it can be done.  That being said unless the baby has a physical abnormality they can nurse provided you get the right help, even if they won't nurse at all to start.<br>  <br>  Links: Exclusive Pumping<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/bf-links-excpumping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/bf-li...</a>|`|Fd4lITkvaa	1. You don't need special shirts. You can wear nursing tank tops under your regular shirts if you want or just use a nursing bra and a nursing cover. I use the bra and cover.<br>  <br>  2. You can pump although it's a lot more work and most women are unable to maintain supply by pumping alone. I would strongly encourage doing everything you can before deciding to pump exclusively.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	I just wear my normal tops, and I just pull them up slightly to feed her. You shouldn't need to buy any new tops :)<br>  <br>  2) Pumping would work, don't worry! There's lots of help with breastfeeding to make sure your son feeds correctly :)|`|YuVSDBkzaa	1. I did buy new "special breastfeeding" tops and they do work but in the long run (especially after 6 months when my daughter started taking solids and didn't need to nurse as often) I would wear regular shirt that were easy to pull up (i.e. something a little looser) and just cover up with a blanket. With the blanket, people usually didn't even think I was BF, it just looked like she was sleeping or keeping warm. Eventually you will become so adjusted to nursing that you wont even think about it.<br>  <br>  2. It's unlikely that your son will not take to BF. It may take a little while, but he will learn (and it is true, they have to "learn" how to BF). It was about two weeks before my daughter and I got use to BF and after that it was pretty much smooth sailing. Word of advice, don't give up! The first two weeks of BF are the hardest but you will not regret it in the end! Make sure you talk to a lactation consultant before leaving the hospital and I've been told that it's best to BF the baby SOON after he's born! The sooner, the better. Don't wait.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and God Bless!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	you don't need special shirts- i never got any<br>  2 most babies DO take to breastfeeding and if it's difficult then you can get help- you CAN pump but a pump doens't get milk out like a baby so your supply can dwindle and pumping is time consuming. jsut make sure you have a lactation consultant on hand. if it hurts bad then you need to adjust his latch|`|CVdcrY3kaa	1. I wear a simple tank top under my regular shirts. When I go to breastfeed my daughter I lift up my regular shirt, and pull down my tank top to expose my breast just enough so my daughter can latch on. Nobody can see any extra skin, and I didn't have to buy any new clothes! <br>  <br>  2. Yes, you can pump. However, a pump will never be as effecient when it comes to pumping milk as your baby will if he is able to nurse. It can be very difficult within the first few weeks to breastfeed, stick with it...it'll get easier! I promise!|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	1. Well I haven't changed my wardrobe, I'm actually still wearing my regular clothes from before being pregnant, most of my shirts are either button down or stretchy thus I'm able to simply pull down the top to breastfeed.<br>  <br>  2. Yes you can pump but try as much as you can to put the baby on the breast soon after delivery to help in establishing a healthy feeding pattern. If for whatever reason baby refuses the breast don't despair you can pump and still be able to provide the little guy with his milk. All the best to you.
6L9jJnchaa	I live in San Diego, and I got one done at 14weeks, 5 days at the Hi Mom 4d place in the Chula Vista mall.  <br>  <br>  Found out we're having a boy. =)  Here's the video.

And it was really amazing. i wanted to confirm from my 20 week (check up) ultra sound that I was having a boy and it is. :)  Just be careful if they say girl, because sometimes your boy parts may not be developed enough and they may say girl automatically. But if they say boy there less likely to be wrong! You should be able to tell if he/she cooperates! Mine woudlnt let us see his face very well (hid behind my placenta teh whole time!) and even gave us the finger haha I have a picture of it. You'll love it! and congrats|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I've had a 3D/4D sonogram in CA, but not San Diego. They are generally the same though! lol. I was 25 weeks, and it was SO CLEAR. I believe you have an EXCELLANT shot of learning the gender. The one I went to has a 100% money back guarentee if they are wrong.|`|mPhsJ6Fjaa	i got a 3d done at my dr office when i was pregnant. it was so clear. you can really see the baby, not just the outline of it as with a regular sono.
b073P2Wkaa	I really started to notice, but only when I woke up or when my bladder was full, around 3.5 months.  Don't worry about not feeling hardness in your tummy.  Especially with the first one it can take a long time, and it depends on your pre-pregnancy morphology as well.<br>  <br>  I started really showing around Christmas time, which would be 19-20 weeks I suppose.  Everyone could notice by then, even strangers.<br>  <br>  Congratulations and best of luck!|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I'm 21 weeks, and my stomach just started getting more firm, high up, right under my breasts. I am showing a little, but I definitely don't have a standard "bump." Just remember that everyone is different. You might experience something totally different.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	With your first, you normally don't start to really show until 5 months or so.  As far as your stomach feeling hard earlier on, you would feel the difference in your pelvic area.  As the baby grows your bump expands to your belly button area.  I didn't notice my stomach feeling harder until I was around 14 weeks.  Everyone is different.  Jot down a list of questions to ask your doctor when you go.  This might ease your mind and help relieve any confusion you might have!<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	I am four months and my stomach didnt feel like it was getting hard until around 3 months. My swelling died down at 3 months and my tiny pregnant belly was even harder to see. Now its getting a tad bigger but feels firm to the touch. So you probably wont notice a little belly until 3-4 months if you are at a normal weight. Im pretty thin so i think i started to show early but around 4-5 months to begin to show with your first baby is normal.|`|o2ehEqinaa	Everyone's different but I can tell you from my experience....  I didn't start showing until I was about 19 weeks.  I'm an average size woman... 150lbs - size 8.  I don't know when I started feeling my stomach become harder but you will feel it in the earlier weeks in your lower part of your belly and as your uterus grows you'll feel it higher and higher.<br>  Congratulations and Good Luck!|`|GUUgeptjaa	So you are three months then? Well that would be only 12 weeks or about so most likely depending on weight and if you are slim or heavy will determine when you will show and your stomach will harden, but most likely around the 4th month.....which is when mine did with my first but I was super skinny too.....my friend whom was larger we did not notice a big difference until she was about 5 1/2 months|`|yPNvecc7aa	I started really showing at 20 weeks. It seems to be the norm from what I read on here. If you do a search for this question you will have a better idea!<br>  Don't worry about it. Everyone is different.|`|xiCQj8YTaa	it so depends on your build how you will show, some people pop out some people don't show anything till they are around 5 months, sometimes the baby sits in your back more so you hardly show at all and depends on how much weight you put on there is a lot of factors so without seeing you its hard to say and you start to feel something just above your pubic bone so basically where your pubic hair stops <br>  hope that helps!|`|xkSuKSn8aa	I am assuming you had a positive pregnancy test.<br>  You will feel a little lump right above your pubic bone when your uterus begins to grow.|`|Slw6D95Paa	nothing to worry about. everyone is like "I'll show at six!" but its between 3 months and 4 that you will start to show
6ZjoX2Akaa	Put him in there anyway. My boys have done the same thing. It's just a phase, he will grow out of it.|`|4iXL4C6paa	Then I would take him outside and hose him down lol....I would try to make it fun for him, add some bubbles, a couple of toys, and tell him to hop his butt in.|`|qzY6TuQmaa	Mrs. B is right! dont leave the bathroom until he takes a bath hes ganna cry and what not but would u rather him stay dirty??  or u can make bath time a lil bit more fun toys bubbles.|`|XvJ3JJKGaa	Ummm. . . your obviously stronger and more in control then a toddler. MAKE them take a bathhh. It's not there choice.|`|fKoNyRGyaa	i agree, make it fun for them. give them some bath crayons and show them how to draw on the wall in the bath. that will usually get their attention.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Refusal shouldn't be an option for a 3 year old.  He is the child, the adult is in charge, not him.|`|x3fQP9viaa	Suggest he is way too big for baths and 3 year olds take showers.
e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	I agree with everyone above.  Plus remember your blood vessels engorge a bit during pregnancy.  It could be a tiny bleeder.  A lot of women spot just because hormones are so wacky and it confuses your body.  all the important details sound fine.  If you are really worried go to the ER but I think sitting in the waiting room will make it worse plus irritate you.|`|29ddeea7f871392bf7b17a12fc77a694aa	your fine seriously stop worrying so much i knew a girl who thought she had a cold for 7 months and turned out she was pregnant so she did have something that resembled a period.... her baby is fine|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey some ladies do bleed during pregnancy and no one knows why darling.<br>  it could coming from your cervix if possibly sex occured<br>  it could be old blood the body is expellying<br>  As long as the bleeding isnt heavy or strong cramps you are okay.<br>  <br>  god bless x Try keep off your feet & drink lots of water|`|fa7f262b7fe76b6e718a0faa1796731baa	maybe get a second opinion they have to tell you something about the blood to ease your mind.
AA11210211	Some do but a majority of them don't.My Brother In Law has custody of his daughter and moved 5 states away from her mother.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I knew someone that this was going to happen to so she moved back to that state and she has the kids there with their new husband but she didn't want to live in that state but is forced too.|`|AA11206135	Please don't feed the troll
BRT2teSqaa	I dont know whats so hard about understanding this question. It's quite clear.<br>  <br>   I know of a couple that does not allow their parents to see their children because the father is a convicted sex offender.  That's a good reason.  Any other cases that I have heard of are for good reasons such as this.  I wouldnt say it's exactly common though.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Whattt? That makes NO sense...|`|AA11206135	It's "their" not "there.. If you're going to post questions like this a thousand times a day at LEAST spell them correctly...
CcgDj9GIaa	You can apply for Section 8.  You only give 1/3 of your income so either way it will be beneficial to you and your baby who are clearly struggling.  Contact a city public housing authority near you and they should be able to help you out; especially if there's a baby on the way so soon.  I would do this ASAP so please don't wait.  It's better to live in a low income home than have no place for you or your child to live.  Times are hard so don't feel ashamed to seek help for it.<br>  <br>  Also, don't worry about money.  As soon as the baby is born make sure you file for child support from the father; it's not fair that you're making an effort to get a roof over your baby's head while the father is not even trying.  You can use that to help pay for the baby's items and the rent to house the baby.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and congrats!!!|`|xWYKqcDjaa	Get on welfare. Its the latest craze these days.<br>  <br>  (sarcasm.)
fboC1N7gaa	I agree... go with Skyler.  Caitlin has become very common, and I love the nickname Skye!
b85nVIzoaa	Seeing as you've had spotting, I would go straight to the hospital if I were you. It sounds like early labour and it's better to be safe than sorry. My own little girl was born over 5 weeks early and started just like you. Best of luck and I hope everything goes well for you. Take care and best wishes for you and your little one :)|`|VdwfoWQwaa	100% sounds like labor. I would get to the hospital ASAP. If the "spotting" is pink or red with mucous in it there is no doubt. Try to time how far apart the 'period' cramps are apart. If you can feel pressure down below however, you really need to get in! Good luck! :)|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Maybe you should go to labor and delivery, especially with the spotting. Good luck|`|0MUvGlHkaa	it sure does sound like it|`|XaysYqriaa	go to the hospital|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	you should def call your OB-your due on my son's birthday he was a month early|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	kinda yes i hope not try and relax honey|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Perhaps... you should go in if you don't have an appt. soon and have them check you(also even if you do have an appt tomorrow or soon, call labor and delivery and see if they want you in today). If your water hasn't broken though,and labor and delivery says to stay put, I wouldn't worry to much about rushing to the hospital unless the spotting gets worse, or the pain becomes so intense you have to close your eyes and stop what your doing. Congrats! :)|`|GUUgeptjaa	I also had preterm labor, best to go in, especially if you are spotting, and i had the period pain too...I had the same at 26 weeks and also then at 31 weeks, and they put me on bedrest and gave me meds|`|AA12373051	yes it does i would go asap to the er and get it checked out   good luck|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	go to the er best way to find out
d7kGopYxaa	Gross!|`|I64JOuMKaa	youuuuu go to the back where there car drives up to where they're performing and when they get out you scream and meet em .. i guess<br>  LOL.|`|9zwSclnLaa	You don't.  If you don't pay to meet them, they won't let you in.  Ahh, those dreamy Jonas Brothers don't even want to meet their fans...*sarcasm*.|`|Afj1GGptaa	Whay duz everybody like them. GET A LIFE!!!!
umca7pwoaa	I'm 22 weeks 5 days pregnant and experiencing the same thing. Also, when I sneeze or something I feel a tight stitch in my lower abdomen sometimes. It sounds like it's just your body stretching and giving room to your little one. That's what they said mine is. However, if the pain is constant, timeable, or really painful I would call the hospital and speak to a nurse. Otherwise it sounds like round ligament pains.|`|faHWQYMIaa	depending on where exactly in your abdomen the pain is it could be different but very normal things.<br>  <br>  If its the lower area of the pelvis it could be the bone softening and widening. I get really bad pain like pinching when that happens. <br>  <br>  I also have a feeling like ive done a thousand sit ups.<br>  <br>  If the doc says its normal im sure it is.|`|U5g6kSa7aa	Im a first time mom, only 7 weeks today, and Im feeling it! My doctor said that it IS your body stretching, esp. being a first time mom, and things in your body just have to adjust! It is QUITE uncomfortable, but its not something to worry about. only if its like severe cramping! <br>  good luck!|`|zxhCy80eaa	Probably round ligament pain. Going through that myself right now with baby number 3. You may need to go and elevate your feet for awhile. Tylenol is also safe to take during pregnancy. Lie down and try putting your feet up for awhile. If that does not help, contact your doctor to check for any other complications. Hope you feel better and congrats.
vGxipYJnaa	Some people chart their ovulation so they know when it probably happened. You can also count backwards from your due date to figure it out if you want. <br>  <br>  It may also be that your friends don't have a lot of sex - but it's probably that they chart.|`|LABC73E7aa	Go to the doctor!
LbHuUxkhaa	The Pill is called Mifepristone it blocks the hormone progesterone needed to maintain the pregnancy. Because this hormone is blocked, the uterine lining begins to shed, the cervix begins to soften and bleeding may occur. Which then you'd need to take a 2nd load of medication into your vagina.<br>  <br>  Because the woman chooses when she takes the second medication within the time frame of 24 to 72 hours after the first medication, she has some control over the timing of when she expels the pregnancy and experiences the side effects of bleeding and cramping. <br>  <br>  My Story:<br>  <br>  After I took the mifepristone at the clinic I didn't start to bleed until the next day it was light bleeding much like spotting towards the end of a menstrual period but I passed the fetus before I even went for the 2nd lot of medication in the toilet after waking up. <br>  <br>  I then went to the hospital not realising that I passed the fetus already as I thought it was a blood clot. I had second medication misoprostol tablet insurted on what looked like a tampon into my vagina. I then had a lot of cramping which came in waves with increasing and decreasing intensity, it was really painful at points and made me cry in pain.  bleeding, and clotting. I felt really sick and was given tablets to stop me from throwing up. They made me wait in the hospital for 6 to 8 hours, which is when most women will miscarry as I passed the fetus in the morning and they couldn't find the fetus so I then had to go for a 2nd scan to check and they said I had a lot of blood clots so they made me stay another hour to clear them out, I was bleeding heavier than a menstrual period with large clots. During that time, it was all done into bedpans in the room which the nurse had to take out and look through. I then once they were finished had to have a large bullet shapped tablet put into my anus. Then once they let you "go" you need to go give blood for them to test for anything that could cause problems and you start a long period. Mine lasted 10 days I think it was. <br>  <br>  hope that helps.|`|T48smu01aa	Then look it up yourself google it or something|`|F8iyUqJBaa	If you are referring to Plan B or the morning after pill, here are the facts.  You go to your local pharmacy and buy it.  During the first 72 hours after an egg has been fertilized it requires progesterone to grow and survive.  What the pill does is provide an artificial progesterone the block the woman's body's natural production of it and the real stuff can't get to it.  In essence, it "starves to egg to death" so that the egg can not survive.  If not taken in the first 72 hours it does nothing.|`|rAD0mL7Saa	You go into a clinic and take the first pill and stay lying on a bed under observation for 8 hours for adverse reactions. Then you go home, take the second pill and have like a miscarriage but in the span of a period instead of over a month. You dilate slightly and it's almost identical to a natural miscarriage.
qdFrJ21waa	The website for plan B says your period can be up to a week late as a side effect and if your period is more than 7 days late you might be pregnant.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	i have taken it and my period was a few days late. don't worry yet as long as you took the pill within 48 hours of unprotected sex. I didn't really have any side effects. I thought that there was going to be a period when I took the pill but it just prevents ovulation.|`|6440aca54e76133287a99d198c3d1a37aa	side effect:  having a baby<br>  <br>  no, I haven't taken it, I'm a guy...congratulations mommy!!|`|AA11508703	You should have had one within minutes... least everybody i know that has taken it has... <br>  <br>  <br>  Not normal... I would call whomever gave you the pill and ask. I would be more scared of STD's than of pregnancy.. 1 you can always fix.
WPI0Z47saa	The 5th day. Mine was hard to come in since I had a c-section and it doesn't always trigger your body's chemistry to start the milk. I actually helped it by after my son fed, I pumped for 15 minutes each time afterwards and it started the flow up better (lactation counselors advice).|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	just because it's not tons doesn't mean it is not full mature milk- pumping doesn't get nearly as much as baby. just nurse your baby and don't think about it- mine was about day 4. it take about 6 weeks to get a good milk supply established|`|8d89b255ad0cc448257f013c1fb8f3a8aa	mine took 2 days after i gave birth... yours sounds like its still the colostrum... it should be coming soon!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Breast milk can be yellow.  <br>  <br>  How do you know you "barely have any milk"?<br>  <br>  Are you bottle feeding?<br>  Are you supplementing with formula?<br>  Do you have PCOS, diabetes, hypothyroidism?<br>  Have you ever been anemia before becoming pregnant?<br>  Did you have a blood transfusion?<br>  Do you take any medications or supplements?<br>  <br>  What does breastmilk look like? <a href="http://www.mother-2-mother.com/motherconcerns.htm#Whatdoesbreastmilklooklike" rel="nofollow">http://www.mother-2-mother.com/mothercon...</a><br>  <br>  Is your milk supply really low?<br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-supply.html#supply" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...</a>|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	My milk never fully came in.  My breasts were not engorged whatsoever.  I was terribly disappointed.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're still producing colostrum, which sufficient for your baby until your milk comes in.  Barring any medical difficulties, I see no reason why your milk won't come in soon.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the breastfeeding!!!|`|ubo0HWtVaa	it should be coming now. are you eating and drinking lots of fluids?<br>  some say that if you have 1 beer that by the next day you will be overflowing with milk. it wouldn't hurt to try 1 or maybe 1/2. <br>  my cousin is married to a german dr and she highly recommended this!|`|cv0foxlTaa	Mine came in about a full week after DS was born.  I hemmoraged really badly and lost a lot of body fluid, so I think that contributed to how long it took for my milk to come in.|`|RmFVYkxeaa	Mine didn't fully come in until 8 days after, by then my little boy was back in hospital because he'd lost more than 10% of his body weight in the 1st week. Has baby been weighed? Does baby seem healthy? or are your maternal senses telling you something. Just that the same thing happend to me and I could see the weight loss in my baby, and he seemed ill. He was back home with me 5 days later and looking a lot healthier. I think the key for us was, at the hospital I'd feed him, then they'd offer him a 'top up' with formula whilst I pumped to see if there was any milk left. Sometimes it can be because baby just isnt strong enough yet to stimulate milk production effectively... it's really hard work for them after being born... which is why they feed for so long at first, my son took an hour each feed & still wasn't getting enough! The fact that your milk is yellow still, means that you're still producing colostrum, which is very healthy rich milk for baby, when your milk comes in it will be very white and breasts will turn into big rocks!<br>  <br>  Get bub weighed, and if he/she is gaining back towards their birth weight then I'm sure all will be fine in a few days. However, I'd highly recommend seeing your clinic nurse, or an obstetrician and getting yourself and baby checked out. Don't see a regular dr - in my experience they know nothing about the sensitivity of the early days of baby's life. Good luck : )<br>  <br>  The weight loss or gain from one day to the next can be a massive indicator of baby's health in the 1st week. So if baby hasn't been weighed within the last day (or 2 at the most!) then you really need to get them weighed again = if your milk hasn't come in yet... which yours hasn't if you've still got colostrum.|`|myEwHgI1aa	My milk came in on day 3, and then my son did something that is called "cluster feeding" where he just wanted to eat, and I mean a LOT. That helps to establish the milk supply. <br>  If you are having trouble with your milk supply, you may want to contact a lactation consultant. It is so worth it to have one of them help you out with breast feeding. <br>  By the way- congrats! My son was born on Feb. 28th also :)|`|bWu4p5OBaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Mine took 5-6 days. Colostrum is yellow. Your milk can also be quite yellow in the beginning. Just keep nursing like ALL the time and you'll be fine. Be careful with supplementing b/c it will mess with your supply. Only do it if it's a MUST. Good luck!|`|cezWu0Wnaa	Yellow is good, in fact it's awesome for your baby. My milk supply came in about 4 or 5 days, it can take longer though. Hang on. Good luck and congratulations!|`|GqsLNUE8aa	Day six. Breastmilk can be yellow but usually when your milk comes in fully your boobs will become engorged. Give it time, it'll come. :)|`|A1QpwziEaa	I would say 3 days after birth.  I think i first noticed that it was milk in the shower when I was home from the hospital...|`|qzY6TuQmaa	2weeks after.|`|uAnw9LAQaa	I would say it would depend on how much you are feeding, and how much water you are drinking. Everyone is different but with both of my children it came in between 4 and 6 days.I know it is hard not to but if you are constantly stressed about if your baby is getting enough milk it actually makes it worse. The best thing you can do is drink tons and tons of water and relax and enjoy your time together! Congrats!|`|SFNXSLumaa	mine came in 3 days after the birth. It can take about 5 days. Yellow milk is colostrum, and you never have much of that. They wouldn't have sent you home if your baby wasn't gaining weight well or if they were worried. If your baby seems content and isn't crying for food all the time, it should be ok. Give it some more time, you will know when it comes in! ouch! I wouldn't give it too much longer though, your baby is the best judge of if it is a problem or not.|`|qW5PqMepaa	5-6 days after. Everyone is different. As long as you baby is getting the colostrum he/she will be fine - they have very tiny stomachs. If you are worried you could give your baby a top up feed with formula - but don't make it a habit as you need to be trying to build up your mild supply.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Mine came in between 2 and 3 days after I gave birth.|`|TlA2z5XJaa	Mine came on the 5th day.
5IlaGPxUaa	Jordan is 7 and a half months....<br>  <br>  He is playing with his ears and i took him to the doctor.... No infection but they didnt tell me it could be teething?<br>  <br>  He is dribbling heaps !! Strings of it everywhere....<br>  Wont let me rock him at all and i thought it was because i Had started self settling so i just lay him down and he plays til he drops off....So i thought that was why he didnt let me Rock him....?<br>  <br>  Anyhow Jordan has hardish gums but there is no sign of teeth at all no white.... NO swelling<br>  Jordan has become unbelieveably clingy but i put that down to him just developing his space awareness from me>>?<br>  I dont breast feed but He is eating his milk and solids fine so i dont have that issue....<br>  <br>  Seems like Jordan and Your daughter are going through the same thing !!!<br>  <br>  It should get better soon...|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Oh, that's a teething baby for you.  The good news is it will pass. My son cut his first two teeth at 4 1/2 months and it was hell. <br>  <br>  Diaper rash can occur during teething, as well as fussiness at the breast, but be sure to rule out thrush.  This can cause diaper rash as well as getting upset at the breast. <br>  <br>  Teething can also prevent wanting to suck,  but so can an ear infection.  Rubbing ears some can be teething related, but so can ear infections, so be sure to watch for other signs of an ear infection.  The disliking of being rocked can be an indication of an ear infection as well.  Its not know for sure, but it is thought by some health care professionals that teething can increase the chance of an ear infection because of the excess drooling pooling into ear canals.  <br>  <br>  Try offering some tylenol for pain, and also teething rings for comfort.  Check her temperature often, and if she has a temperature accompanied with the fussiness, call the doctor and bring her in to get checked out.  <br>  <br>  I hope she is feeling better soon..... and don't give up and breastfeeding, these problems won't last forever. <br>  Good luck!|`|qayCggxMaa	Actually is sounds to me more likely to be an ear infection than teething.  A lot of the symptoms can be the same for the two, but it's the hysterical when you try to rock her that leads me to that conclusion.  Fluid in her ears from an ear infection could be messing with her balance and making her feel very dizzy or spinning when you rock her.  I'd recommend taking her to the doctor to get checked just in case.|`|DLDweOcYaa	Sounds like it could be teething.  My daughter had all those symptoms for 2 months before her teeth actually came through.  Her 1st tooth came through when she was 10 months and then 2nd one just came through the other day, 3 weeks after the 1st tooth.  Have you tried giving her some baby paracetamol?|`|fvmKx667aa	Sounds like a teething baby. My baby has been the same way for 4 days, it took a turn for the worse. Everyone kept telling me to get the Hylands Teething Tablets. I used them and it was like instant relief for her. Since giving them to her at first last night she has eaten better and been calm and sleeping again. I had tried everything else before it. It took me forever to get them cause the store was always out of them :( Now I know why, they work so well<br>  <br>  Add - For the diaper rash, I love A&D ointment and it works the best for my daughter. Also have you been drinking or eating anything with more acidity? I have been sick and drinking OJ like crazy and didnt even realize that would cause diaper rash.
f0c14af9cf77a6bb68c4ffdbb372cdacaa	i was told to wait for about nine months before trying again to give all my internal muscles time to heal properly, the outside scarring may heal pretty quickly but the internal takes a bit longer i think.  i don't know what the dangers are, they don't tell you that do they?!  they just tell you to give yourself time to heal....as for contraception....i'm too knackered, thats the best contraception lol xx|`|qW5PqMepaa	I'm not sure of the exact dangers, but i had a c-sec last november and I have recently asked my doctor when is the best time to start trying again for baby #2, and he basically told me to wait until around 18 months after to allow your body and pelvis to heal properly.<br>  This is just my opinion, but I would think atleast 6 months would be ok, before that you have internal scaring that is still healing from a major operation. I know that doesn't fully answer your question. I'm curious to see other people answers too though!|`|AA10588223	I don't think the difference between c-section and vaginal wait/complication time is MUCH different. I've had 2 c-sections and I'll be having my third on March 13th- exactly a year and three days after my last. My doctor had only said It'd been preferable if I had waited at least 7 months to get pregnant again. But I do think it puts you at a very small higher risk of uterine rupture from possibly not having enough time for your insides to heal properly. Mostly if you get pregnant now the main concerns will be things such as your iron levels(which has been my docs biggest concern),stress and all the same things that would go with getting pregnant too soon after a vaginal delivery.Hope this helps you some and congrats on the new baby!|`|VL8e3E4zaa	I agree with everything the 1st answer says.. I reckon 6 months is no biggie if it were to happen but it's not a good a idea coz after carrying a baby for 9 months and a major op you'd probably want to allow your body some healing time.. I had a c-section too so can understand your concerns..  Get straight on those contraceptives woman! lol.

eS4CSdQ5aa	as pregnant women we have to watch what we eat.<br>  <br>  it doesnt mean we cannot eat sugary type foods it just means we have to eat it in moderation.<br>  <br>  please watch what you eat as you dont want to cause baby too much sugar and gestational diabetes.<br>  <br>  29 weeks and no gestational diabetes! yay!|`|yPNvecc7aa	I am in the same boat! I'm 30 weeks and from the start, all I've wanted was sugar! Candies, cakes, cookies, chocolate, whatever!<br>  I eat very well usually and I haven't stopped doing that. However I started buying myself "a desert" for every night after supper. I don't feel guilty about eating it either.<br>  This week, JoeLouis. Last week, a cake from the bakery. Next week, hmmm... maybe some Chips Ahoy cookies. lol|`|AA11294818	I am pretty sensitive to sugar, I suspect I am susceptible to developing gestational diabetes if I don't watch my intake, so I try to stick to balanced stuff like sweet fruits etc when I'm craving things or nut/honey concoctions with dark chocolate that I can get at health stores. <br>  <br>  If you are even slightly worried about your sugar intake, I'd suggest you just make sure you get some good stuff with it as well. For one, I stay away from refined/white sugar. It is so over processed and robbed of all nutrients and washed in animal (yes, sometimes even pig) albumin. They bleach it over and over again to make it stark white, heaven knows why. I think that's why sugar is hurting our society's health.. because there is a lack of minerals and nutrients in the sugars we eat that should naturally be there. Even those brown packets at cafes called "raw sugar" is actually processed then redyed. Brown sugar is also dyed processed sugar. I make sure I eat things with real sugar cane in them or pure raw sugar from natural food stores. Either that or I just use honey :) I can totally understand your cravings, I even had some raw cookie dough at breakfast this morning!! So I just suggest these things to put these foods into a new category for you... not junk, but actually good food with some good taste :)<br>  The organic deli/bakery and I are close friends these days!! And I don't feel near as guilty because I know at least I'm getting other nutrients with the 'junk' food when I give in . It's also a bonus that it's all chemical free, which I would much rather have feeding my baby than other things they sell of grocery shelves that somehow pass as 'food'.|`|vCq3dR40aa	Basically, your body will give your baby the nutrients it needs.  Cravings are the norm during pregnancy.  However, I want to pass on what my Aunt went through.<br>   She was craving all the bad stuff and someone told her that her body was probably not getting enough vitamins and other nutrients.  She started taking double vitamins and her cravings went away.  <br>  <br>  I pass this on with a word of caution.  Check with your doc before doubling up vitamins.  Perhaps you can add Flintstones vitamins to your prenatals.<br>  <br>  I took liquid vitamins and minerals and while I was pregnant, I lost my cravings for sugar, but they are back in force now.|`|xiCQj8YTaa	i think your body craves it as your body is lower in it because the baby is absorbing everything it needs just don't over dose on it cos your start to put on too much weight! <br>  i ate loads of sugary stuff when i was pregnant with my second and i had the symptoms of a diabetic they thought i was !<br>  i was huge had too much water and a big baby but that's cos i ate sugar all day long because that is all i craved! so keep an eye on how much your eatin of the sugary stuff write it down and look back on it and then you can judge on how much you are eating!<br>  in moderation everything is ok i think and if you crave it have it but don't over do it <br>  be strong!<br>  carbs are energy and if you crave it have it but the same as before don't over do it !<br>  good luck

C8jI6rzPaa	I am soooo with you on this one:-) It seems so unfair that woman like us who can't wait to be mothers have to wait for it to happen, and some irresponsible girls can just conceive on the first try...and then not even care less about the consequences.

I just got three positives,...my hcg has been slow to detect.  last week i went to get a neg,..blood test.  but i had been getting weird periods,..i swear not a real one.// Boobs have changed and have been hurting for three and a half weeks,..making milk too, soft and squishy.  the doc said it must just be some weird thing my body is doing.  i went home took a test during my supposed "period" got another faint line.  i figured since there was blood i was miscarrying or something. I let it go,...and had an entire bottle of wine,..assuming i was just miscarrying.  after the weekend and my short period,..i wondered where all the heavy blood went?? i never got any.  I got blood, but just one and a half day...med-light flo...freaky...Monday I took a hpt (i swore i was giving up on all these damn faint positives..my big diet had to start Monday, I ran my usual run,...ate, you know a strict "get in shape for summer" diet.  I put the kids to bed (keep in mind i held my pee all day and drank nothing, not by choice, I was busy and out of the house with the kids) I took a cheap hpt and left it for a few minutes,...went back and was seeing the positive line I swore should've been there a while ago.  I was happy. 36 hours later,..(after drinking milk and well my usual three liters of water,..and peeing every hour,) I dared to take another ...ohhhh I prayed that the first wasn't some freak thing.....and there came another line,...it was faint but blue and there.  I then, determined to get another dark line, held pee for 4 hours and took another and the line was darker than the prior test.  I was happy. So I called the doc to tell them that I have been getting the positive tests and they are definate.  <br>  so i have an apt next week. I am sooooooo scared that because i have all these breast soreness and milk coming out and,...feeling weird, that (with my luck) will say,.."oh its a tubal." I have no idea what the chances are,...just with my luck!!! any how,..i want to tell you I have a collection of pregnancy tests that i have taken and I call the ones with the faintest lines my trophies. I keep them in a back and sit them on a shelf. I started taking them weeks ago when my body turned weird on me. I shouldn't want to be pregnant (broke up with boyfriend) at the same time i am going thru a NASTY divorce from a man who has abused my children.) But I accept a child from God like no other gift.Babies are amazing. So who cares about the boyfriend and the husband...! anyhow,..my faints were so faint that i had to depend on different lighting from different times of the day...I had to tilt most of the damn tests...and still i wasn't sure if it was just my mind or my eyes playing tricks on me.  I thought I was insane. I went on-line and looked at www.peeonastick.com every morning.  I bought tests from the dollar tree store,...some first response (i saw faint lines but the white background in the window makes it hard to see even the faintest pink line) I knew some shadow of a line was there,...but not worth the money.  I fell in love with the target brand,..it is sensative and cheap...I got very faint faint shadow blue hint of a line,..only visible in day light on a tilt...but i waited and kept testing til it got darker....then blood test was negative...still faint lines (what the heck???) so thats why i decided I was done,...but boy, I can't tell you i am so happy that i have seen these faint (but darker lines and then the one dark blue line) i took a picture of the dark one...I just hate to get excited and have it taken away,..like be some freak thing....<br>  I am sure that if you have a hint of a line,...it will eventually develop into a darker one.  You know what they say,..if you see a line,..even the faintest, you are pregnant,...the test dectects hcg in your urine.  It won't tell you how far along you are, and hcg is easily diluted in urine.  Everyone's bodies are different...they produce it at different rates. hang tight,...the level will eventually build...i know,..it's too hard to be patient.  But like the other woman said, by a bunch of chepos, and just go for it...you will get so tired of seing faints to negative.  I think they should advertise with faint lines so we "perfectionist" type of women, don't keep spending our dollars till we get what they promise..(those companies are smart, they know how to make money). <br>  Good luck ...I bet you are!!!
JITTMjasaa	Estimated due date is around Sept. 14 but it can be off. Most calenders assume that it will be a 38 week pregnancy but every pregnancy is different. You can have anywhere between a 36 to a 40 week pregnancy normally. Also, they don't take into consideration that every woman's cycle is different. A woman can have her cycle last anywhere from 19 to 29 days. This will also effect the due date. The doctor will give you an estimated due date but be prepared to see your little ones face two weeks before or after the date given. I like to take into consideration what the pregnancies were like for both the mothers mother and fathers mother. For example, if dad and mom both came early chances are so will baby. Genetics play a big role. Congratulations on your pregnancy. Take care of yourself and don't stress about the little things.

G2auAv1Saa	We did all have our problems growing up. The main problem with it today is people have widespread information and communication mainly the internet. <br>  When I was a child serial killers were running everywhere killing at random- that doesn't really happen these days, but parents didn't freak out about it. <br>  Crime- mainly kidnapping which all the parents on here are terrified of has dropped a lot in recent years and pretty much the only kidnappings are done by relatives. Look at all the main ones in the media- they were done by parents or relatives.<br>  <br>  That's why kids can't play outside, talk to anyone, go anywhere and are inside playing video games all day. <br>  <br>  They are also not taught to be tough at all and I think we have the biggest generation of whiners coming up and it does scare me.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	we had good weed in the 70s & 80s|`|AA11828121	Because in the 80's and 90's crime was bad as well..In the last 30 years crime, politics, sex ed, television, food, education ect. has changed for the worse. <br>  <br>  When my grandma was younger they didn't have tv, walked to school and were expected to play outside. Now we have television, computers, buses and lots more to pay for.<br>  <br>  Luckily i'm on the right track.

None of my friends have ever participated in the act of vandalism, nor have I. The only kids that honestly do that are usually misguided (most likely) due to  a lack of their parents being there for them and caring about them.<br>  Drugs - Sweetie, drugs were around way back when too, it's not like a new thing, it's just being brought to your attention more.<br>  Crime - We (well, my parents) actually recently had our GPS stolen  right out of our car, but alot of crimes tend to be committed out of a need for money (drugs, food, bills, etc).<br>  Sex Education from the age of 5 - My brothers are 11 and 9 and they only found out what sex was a month ago, and my mother told me when I was 13...the same with my friend and her little brother (except her little brother who is 8 still doesn't know).<br>  Teenage Pregnancy - I'll admit, this definitely has become a problem, boys used to be gentlemen and now they're just a bunch of raging hormones and girls used to be ladies but now the word 'no' and 'stop' <br>  (or even  'condom' & 'birth control') doesn't exist in their vocabulary.<br>  Disrespect for adults - For one, age does not equal respect. If someone started talking down to you or told you "you're not allowed to do this because I'm a cop and dammit what I say goes" would you bow your head and listen and respect the, or would you fight them? <br>  Hannah Montana - You got me there, I feel bad for kids having to have her around.<br>  TV 24/7 - TV CAN be educational, whether you're watching the History channel or South Park, it's IMPOSSIBLE to go through a day without learning something new.<br>  Underage Drinking - Honestly, I don't see anything wrong with it, as long as it's in moderation (meaning I don't agree with little kids running around drunk but really, a beer (that was an example..doesn't necessarily have to be a beer) every now and then won't hurt you).<br>  Political Correctness - I don't see why this is a bad thing either?|`|AA11134948	Yes it does seem that way doesn't it?<br>  <br>  But what about....sports?<br>  Or maybe some fun clubs they join?....<br>  <br>  You have made a very good point that I have not thought of before, but I can not think of anything around it beside thinking about, what did I look back upon? There was vandalism drugs and crime when I was little, but I guess the whole sex Ed was left out.<br>  The great depressions were a bit before my time....<br>  <br>  Wow, but what can we do about it?|`|6nUprmu5aa	I don't care if the outside world is screwed up. My children all have proper childhoods. They learn about the things you listed above but we teach them that those things are bad and that they need to stay away from them. A 5 year old has no business knowing about sex!!!|`|aCUHzMrmaa	LOL at Hannah Montanna. Don't forget to mention never going outside and childhood obesity and illiteracy.  I definitely agree with you dude.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	not all parents will allow there children to have a life like that.....these are merely negatives in a society as a general today not in every child life and household.|`|h6hNQjn5aa	Yeah but kids are only like it because parents allow it.|`|NDU36H4Vaa	The children from the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s had all of the above except Hannah Montana. <br>  <br>  In the 30s, 40s, and 50s, many children had stay at home mothers to do all kinds of neat things with and to cook them home cooked meals. <br>  <br>  Before I had my daughter, I was a teacher at a non-profit and a public school. One of my own principles is to raise & educate my daughter differently than a lot of modern children. Sometimes we hang white laundry for fun and I have even made dish detergent with her her from the old fashioned great depression way that my grandparents did (it is A LOT cheaper too - my website will have the directions soon - <a href="http://www.geocities.com/heather_inks" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/heather_inks</a><br>  <br>  As a teacher, I saw A LOT of sad children who spent ALL DAY at school. They were in before school care, breakfast at school, school, after-school clubs & sports, and extended day. They HAD to be since their parents both worked or in the case of a single parent, had to work. <br>  <br>  Our neighbor's elementary aged daughter goes off to school bright & early, takes a bus to extended childcare at another school, & then comes home to do homework, eat, and go to bed. 5 days a week. She seems sad. <br>  <br>  My husband and I moved to a state with better job prospects for him and downsized so that I could stay home with our daughter. We could have stayed in our previous home which looked like the whitehouse where our child has 2 bedrooms to herself and we had as many bathrooms as people, but I would have probably have had to go back to work to keep it since he lost his job and could not replace it equally in the area. <br>  <br>  From my perspective as a teacher, dealing with thousands of students & parents, many parents care more about having large homes, 2 cars with loans, and designer clothes & shoes over spending time with their children. So school becomes a babysitter and tv becomes a babysitter too. The kids feel so sad and rejected because actions speak louder than words or gifts so they turn to gangs, drugs, crime, sex, drinking, and they are disrespectful of adults because they don't think they REALLY care about them. <br>  <br>  I left a lucrative financial career to go into teaching (I thought I couldn't conceive) so my students felt like I cared about them and acted differently in my classroom than in other classroom where the teacher was just putting in time for a paycheck and retirement. <br>  <br>  As an adult and a spouse, I would not like it if my husband put money, his career, or his selfish desires (whether tv, sports, friends, etc) over me and so it is the same with our children. They know what their parents true priorities are and their attitude towards adults reflects that. <br>  <br>  There are some better things now though. The Internet can make learning more interesting & technology can make learning more relevant and applicable if used appropriately. Women have voting rights and people of all backgrounds, nationalities, and those with disabilities all have more opportunities than before. In the last 30 years, the laws have changed so that marital rape is considered rape - it was not considered rape 50 years ago. About 1/3 of states need to improve laws regarding this still but it is slowly progressing. Child abuse and incest was overlooked, as well as date rape, in the 20s and 30s. Some women in the US were even forced to marry the man who date raped them back then, some of those women are still alive today. So children and women have more rights regarding what happens to their bodies and who they marry today, that is much better. Unfortunately, in Virginia the courts reversed a rape conviction where a husband raped his wife in front of the children because they were still married; however, I hope to see the laws improved even more. That can be found here: <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/952023/societal_ambivalence_sexual_propriety.html?singlepage=true&cat=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  If we want to see things improved for children today, then we need to get involved. We need to write into the president & our government officials, as well as getting involved personally by providing the time and resources for our children and other people's children to have what they might be lacking. Our communities will only be as strong and safe as we make them when we help the families & children in need.|`|wedAGKW8aa	Its not all that bad at all. Generally the worst news gets the media, so adults are almost brainwashed into a stereotypical view of teenage life. We aren't all asbos and hoodies. Sure we like to have a laugh like i'm sure you probably do, but for us this is the only time we can enjoy the lack of responsibility, so who cares if we're a bit loud XD I cant help but think you are only looking back on the negatives (Hannah Montana- you cant get much worse) :P. We also look back on them very special friends, them craaaazy times where you can't stop laughing, all of them little things that seemed so important at the time. To me personally the various 90s lifestyle seems so strict and impossible to have fun in, but i bet you didnt think that as you were brought up in it-its the same for us, we dont know any different so it doesnt bother us :P
BilLTGLFaa	Mine was at around 5 weeks pregnant, so only a week after my missed period.|`|TN6IQYoPaa	Actually I was going to ask this on here too!! I am 4 weeks preggers but don't have sore or tender breasts, makes me wonder what's going on!!|`|zSABr7praa	before I even knew I was pregnant.  They grew an entire cup size by 7 weeks.  Every pregnancy is different!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It was after. At around 9 weeks.|`|O97ZoHGXaa	i didnt have tender breasts until i was feeding from them. I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone using pregnancy symptoms as a guide to see if your pregnant. everyone can be so different, i had no symptoms what so ever for the whole 40 weeks!|`|SQpjHOzVaa	My breast are sore now but I'm not sure if I'm pregnant. I just had my period 2 weeks ago and had sex before during and last day of my period and my breast are now really sore to the touch and tender.|`|n86nMfbtaa	I had been trying for two months with my boyfriend and ever since we started trying, a few weeks after, they were so sore! And I wasn't pregnant until about two months after the soreness kicked in, so I don't know :(|`|bGRexKPyaa	I think it was after missed period.<br>  <br>  I was around a month and a half.<br>  <br>  Everyone is diffrent,|`|qzY6TuQmaa	my first pregnancy my breast got sore after i gave birth lol my 2nd yea it was after my missed period|`|PvnnWE1Baa	Mine began at 4wks pregnant!

I had irregular periods so I wouldn't be sure if it was before or after. My breasts hurting were one of the main reasons that I did a pregnancy test, I was about 5 or 6 weeks along when I found out.|`|QSodlfMraa	24 weeks and no sore boobs. i do not think every one get that.
264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	Most likely she is free, but I would call to be safe.  We've taken our 13 month old daughter to Baseball games and she is free until she is 3...same with Disneyland and most other places.  BUT we took a boat ride to Catalina Island and there was a $4.00 charge each way for her, so it just depends.  Most of the time it's discounted a lot if there is any charge for a baby.|`|PsBABcGqaa	I would call the stadium as they may differ..
eV5E9MhUaa	Totally okay. My Dr prescribed monistat 7 to me while I was pregnant with my first. Actually becoming pregnant can screw up your natural cycle down there and cause a yeast infection. You haven't done anything wrong, and congrats on your baby!|`|kcGFK36Waa	I used it all through my pregnancy with Alyssa and shes perfect, since like i was 12 weeks into pregnancy. the doctor told me 2 use it. its fine ur baby will be fine don't worry. I used it about 4 times during my pregnancy I used the 3 day one.|`|DNyQYKLHaa	Well everything should be OK in my opinion, don't worry. Well you did the right thing booking a doctor appointment. Best thing to do now is to just not worry, and wait for the appointment. I'm sure everything will be fine. Good Luck with the baby. xx|`|0U9469GAaa	I developed an infection and my dr told me to use the exact same one and my baby is still doing good..so try not to stress to much..goodluck.|`|L9Yzg5IWaa	My doctor told me that if you do anything too crazy really early in pregnancy that you'll just have your period.  Talk to your doctor.  I'm sure it'll be okay.|`|U6FFI7jcaa	yes its fine alot of women get yeast infections while pregnant causae the yeast is high while you are prego|`|IFDfpbFJaa	I don't think it's "bad" to use during pregnancy but it's a lot worse to NOT use it during pregnancy. If you have an infection up there, it needs to be taken care of ASAP or it can really hurt you and the baby for that matter, you don't want an infection in there. I just finished the 3 day one last night....but I'm 21 weeks. <br>  Good Luck :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	My doctor told me it was ok to take yeast infection medication while I was pregnant. I did with my first and was fine. <br>  <br>  Also as a general rule most doctors will tell you not to worry about anything you took or did before you knew you were pregnant. Generally it does not effect the baby.<br>  <br>  You mean you are 5 weeks though right? You cant' know you are pregnant at 3. They count pregnancy from the first day of your last period.
FzHaIu8laa	If your asking me, I feel if you move in together what if it does still continue that he plays with his friends and still works alot, whose there too help you with the baby, You are 37 weeks and the baby will be here. You shouldn't be making last minute decisions now. Your going to need alot of help with your baby. Unless he's willing to be there with you and the baby and cool it alot with his friends. But then again your saying youve went to appointments without him.  He needs to show responsibility and play his part of the dad he's going to be. Now how is it going to be better if just by moving intogether at the last minute.    He should have thought about this along time ago and things could have went smoothly maybe.  Stay with your parents, don't do drastic changes at the last minute that you could regret. Think of your baby and you need to take care of yourself right now to have a healthy delivery.  If you do decide to end it now, he's still responsible for child support.  If he wants to stay in your life, I feel he needs to step up to the game and prove to you  that you and your baby come first in his life. HE can do that while your still living at your parents house first. You both still can move in together after the baby's born if it turns to that. Just remember and remind him that a baby is a drastic change in life. Your life is now the baby's life. You do everything to protect and nourish him her and give it love. Sit down and have a deep talk with him and have him show you the father he can be. Best wishes to a wonderful baby your going to have. Hope this helps!|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	I'd say give it a try, but have a backup plan just in case.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	im sure its just the hormones. in my opinion, if you two are having a child together you should at least give it a shot to move in together and see how things work out after the baby is here. its hard to have a real relationship when both of you are still living with your parents. relationships are hard and take alot of work but i think you owe it to your child to try. if you still arent happy when the baby comes, you can make that decision then.|`|o9Xh4ix1aa	I wouldn't recommend ending it until after the baby comes.  You may be right-it could be hormones.  You may feel differently after the baby comes.  But ultimately, do what you think is best for you and your little one.  Good Luck!
AiJeS6I1aa	Clomiphene (Clomid, Serophene) is a drug that is used to induce ovulation in women who ovulate infrequently or not at all... like in PCOS.  Don't worry about it at this time.  It is very successful.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, research has shown that a 15% drop in body weight, regardless of starting weight, induces ovulation and more regular periods.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	First off, everyone is different.  I was diagnosed with PCOS last year and also have a friend who has it.  She went through years of fertility treatments and was told that she would not be able to have children.  After giving up...she got pregnant on her on about a year later and now has a beautiful little girl.  I was just diagnosed last year and haven't had any luck with the "natural" way so far.  I go back to my dr. next week.  <br>  It is really hard to say how it will affect you, but I know there is tons of research online.  I have read that diet and excercise seem to really help most people who have "mild" cases.  Good Luck!|`|Kl5kN2Qaaa	ive got 2 kids last one was born 12 weeks, the doc i went to see yesterday thinks i have PSOC cause ive gained a bit of weight in the last 2 yrs (14 kilos or 30 pounds but i had 2 kids 11 months apart) anyways my friend has had PSOC for ova 10 yrs and she has 3 children but she was on some kind of medication that regulates ur periods and makes u ovulate..im goin to another doctor 2morow to go see endocronoligist to get proper dignosis and treatment...go0o0d luk

The good news is that endurance can be greatly improved by practiced.

(it does not have to be fast though. The point is to keep your heart beating fast.)<br>  The going "with friends" part is important. You will be able to help each other to keep on moving, and while you guys are jogging, you can talk, which also helps a ton!<br>  Then when you are done with your jog (about 20 minutes would be best), you and your friends, should do a quick sprint, not that long though, but enough to give your heart rate that final boost.<br>  <br>  Also, when you are running, try to make sure you have good form. Stay straight with your head held high, keep your shoulders back as well. This will help you get the oxygen to your lungs more easily.<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of in the moment....<br>  Good Luck!

JnLoHaoAaa	First off, does your husband Nick Jonas want sextuplets? You should really talk it over with him.<br>  <br>  People don't really plan on having sextuplets. These people have fertility/reproductions problems that make them have fertility treatments that allow them just to give them the chance to have one child, not 6 all at once. Stuff like that is a fluke and isn't intentional.<br>  <br>  Unless you hunt down Octomom's Dr. and you're healthy, in a good stable relationship, and fertile, I doubt a Dr. is going to implant 6 embryos in you.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Sextuplets means preterm birth, terrible physical costs for the mother, and usually terrible -physical costs for the feti.   The Gosselins were VERY lucky, most are not so lucky, many such pregnancies end in grief not joy.|`|IiML4zYpaa	I want them too but it's like im possible.  You would need to take fertiley drugs and stuff. And, you shouldn't just to be treated like Jon and Kate. <br>  If you just want muitplies it's hard.;<br>  chance of having 'natural' triplets: 1 in 8,100 (only about 30% of triplets are 'natural') <br>  chance of having 'natural' quads: 1 in 729,000 (only about 6% of quads are 'natural') <br>   A chance of having 'natural' quints: 1 in 55,000,000|`|dgRTkccBaa	I bet you were the kind of kid who thought it would be cool to have a broken arm or leg.<br>  Seriously, you have no clue how difficult a multiple pregnancy can be.  The stress on the mother and the babies is life threatening to all of them and the children can end up with lifelong health problems due to premature birth.  Anyone who wants high-order multiples should have their head examined.  The survival rates for babies born a the time most HOM's are born is pretty low.  Think you can handle watching one or more of your children die?<br>  Your very first question about multiples is about the Gosselins.  The only reason you *want* a multiple pregnancy is for the attention.  You have no clue what it really entails.|`|XVljoYZ5aa	You will be VERY hard pressed to find a doctor who is willing to practice unethical procedures on you. Sextuplets occur when infertility treatment goes not as planned. This can be a blessing for couples who have been struggling with infertility, but people who can have babies on there own should never try! It's unhealthy for you, and your future babies. Not to mention the astronomical costs! Not just after, fertility treatment costs hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can't have sextuplets naturally, under any circumstances.|`|fh6TgqENaa	You need to contact a fertility clinic. They will be able to help you answer all of your questions! Good Luck!|`|eJDfkqmkaa	don't you realize the complications that can come with that? all of them might not make it. and if they do all make it they would be in the NICU for a long time. I think that you are crazy to put yourself and poor Innocent babies in that situation.  you sound like the crazy octo mom|`|AuFjh1vraa	I think that you have to ask the Gosselins what kind of treatment they got. Just to let you know you should buy thier book it tells you a lot about sextuplets|`|27m0O7wPaa	Its a very bad idea.  Unsafe for you and the babies.  Any doctor that would help you should be put out of their practice.  Look at Nadya Sulman.  You don't want to be like that.
QVeqeMHNaa	OMG!!!! I LOVE THESE NAMES!  my 2 faves are:<br>  McKinlee Shiloh(i know that wasn't menchioned as a pair but i HATE the name juliet) and Shealyn Arabella! <br>  for boys:<br>  Javin Mitchel and Cashton Jayden|`|Nyc2WH9Baa	javon/jovian- different, sounds biblical, kinda like "jahovah" not my type, but if she likes it, then its fine i guess<br>  <br>  briella dee- love briella, it sounds like it would be short for gabriella, but i really hate dee, sorry<br>  <br>  shiloh kay/mckenna- i love shiloh, its different, and charming, i like it with mckenna more than with kay<br>  <br>  ashley parker/angel- i really can't stand ashley for a boy, its just humilliating! i like parker as a 1st name, angel is an ok middle name<br>  <br>  julian parks/reese- im ok with julian, parks sounds like a nickname for parker, reese is cool!<br>  <br>  mckinlee juliet- LOVE Juliet. Mckinley sounds like a middle name though<br>  <br>  Brandie Ellen- boy or girl? Brandie is adorable for a boy or girl, Ellen is a sweet, gentle name, but for a girl.<br>  <br>  Cashton Jayden- haha Cashton. "Cash" not feelin the love with that name. jaydens very cool, and sleek. cashon and jayden have the same endings, avoid 1st and middle name pairs like that.<br>  <br>  Cael Dean- hmmmm Cael is original, deans cute!<br>  <br>  Aspen Nevaeh- LOVE aspen, never heard of Nevaeh, but it sounds very cool!<br>  <br>  Shealyn Arbella- ummm dont like shealyn, arbella is, um, different..<br>  <br>  I LIKE:<br>  <br>  Ariel<br>  AnnaBelle<br>  Asher<br>  Alfie<br>  <br>  Gabriel<br>  Caleb<br>  Rosie<br>  Shawnah<br>  <br>  James (Jamie) (boy)<br>  Aaron<br>  EmmaLee<br>  Amelie<br>  <br>  wow, quadruplets, good luck to your friend!|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Honestly, they're mostly pretty bad names in my opinion.  If I absolutely had to pick two of each, I'd pick Julian Reese and Ashley Parker for a boy, and I can't bring myself to pick any of those girl's names.

9b36cd20c83580627b271744d6046be0aa	Usually what that means is that you probably won't be able to give birth vaginally. You might have to have a C-section because if your placenta is covering you cervix, you can't push you baby through your placenta to get to your birth canal. Sometimes the placenta moves out of the way by the time you go into labor though. Good luck!|`|fHgbL046aa	I found out at my 18 week scan that my placenta is also lying low. I was told not to worry and will get another ultrasound later on in my pregnancy. I am 21 weeks and 4 days pregnant. They hope the placenta will move up. I hope so too because if not I will have to have a c-section. I still haven't felt the baby move and I was told because my placenta is low it may take longer to feel my baby.|`|pfNnuD5saa	I had that when I had my daughter. It can block the baby's exit and increase the risk of a C section. Don't worry, I had a quick and easy delivery and my daughter is beautiful.|`|lc6Nm3SVaa	hi hun. i had this on my last pregnancy. i was told at 20 weeks about it and i panicked as i had had 2 natural deliveries before that and i didnt like the thought of an epidural for c-section. i got to 37 weeks and had no complications or bleeding. they still couldnt tell on the scans how low the placenta was as there was a shadow from the baby's head blocking the view so they told me I could go naturally, but if i started bleeding in labour they would rush me to theatre. i had a natural delivery with no complications. some women aren't this lucky and the placenta doesn't move before the birth and will need a c-section, but these are quite safe anyways, hope this helps hun|`|SRIaRm08aa	I am 11 weeks and have a low lying placenta as well.  My dr said that your placenta can move.  A low lying placenta or Placenta Previa means that the placenta is lower than your baby and is blocking a vaginal delivery. If you are almost 32 weeks then  the chances of your placenta moving are decreased the later you are.  If your placenta is still low at your next visit then more than likely you will be scheduled for a cesarian section delivery. I know this can seem scary but you cannot deliver a placenta first.  This is in the best interest of your baby and is vital.  Many women have this and it is the numebr one reason why a woman would have a c-section delivery.  If this tends to be the case then you will at least be prepared for it and you may even be able to pick your baby's birthday if your physician allows.|`|AA11916244	When its low it means there is a chance it could be covering the cervix. As you progress the placenta actually moves up in the uterus. If it hasnt and it still covers its called placental previa and they will not let you go into labor and will have to do a c-section. My scan said i had one then last week the dr rechecked and it was fine. I wouldnt worry too much now. Good Luck
f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	The million dollar question!!  Everyone is different, whilst it is called morning sickness some women feel sick any time of the day and sometimes all day!  In most women it lasts until about 10-12 weeks then subsides, however it has been known for women to get it right through (sorry!) I hear ginger is good for nausea, evne a ginger biccie can help (hooray!)<br>  <br>  I was one of the lucky ones and during 3 pregnancies, only felt sick a few times.  Good luck.|`|fynzkVK4aa	It is very much a woman to woman thing; I got terribly sick, worse on each pregnancy, on my last I was still being sick right before delivery, it would hit me anytime, all day, all night..I almost forgot what it was like NOT to feel nauseous, and had to carry an emergency "kit" of nappy sacks and wipes and breath freshener everywhere because I would be sick so much!<br>  <br>  Most people find it passes after about 12-15weeks, but there are the unlucky few like me who have it right up to "the wire"! lol...|`|0vpDDM8aaa	differs from woman to woman.  i was deathly sick by 6 weeks with both my pregnancies....my first pregnancy i was throwing up 5-8 times a day for about 14 weeks.  with this pregnancy, i am 11 1/2 weeks along and am throwing up a couple times a week.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	Every woman is different.  Some woman barely get any morning sickness while others are hospitalized for it.  Be grateful you don't have it to bad.|`|BWUlksmmaa	I get it a couple of times a day where I gag or heave - nothing ever comes up.  Usually on an empty stomach so it is my key to eat something.  I am 9 weeks.|`|l0hb0B31aa	It's different for everyone.<br>  I had very mild nausea during my first trimester, and it was usually because I was hungry. As long as I ate something it would go away. Once into my 2nd trimester the nausea was basically gone.|`|44e9b24b2e24400d7c17634a21ef5efdaa	Sorry you are feeling alittle sick. It can get worse or it may get better every woman is different and every pregnancy is different. I had to carry a small pot with me everywhere as people get upset if your sick on them.|`|8LBl7HgAaa	It all depends. Some people get it bad and some dont get anything. I am the same way as you, I feel a little nauseous but thats it. We are actually lucky if we dont get more sick.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	mine got much much worse, but then i woke up at 13weeks2days and felt amazing, so it does pass, i have heard it can come back in the 3rd trimester :(
OBgqkkqlaa	go to babycenter.com and click on pregnancy, and then click on look inside the womb. It starts at fertilization and goes all the way until a woman is due. It will show you a picture of inside a womb and tell you everything that's happening.|`|lnnwXsdsaa	Go to the Discovery channel website and see if you can find a video you can watch online.  I've seen the show on tv before, so I'm sure you be able to see it on their website.|`|32oKaqaraa	like an alien lol not even kidding look on the web or a health book,
8j7FCEOraa	Oh sure! Just get a regular basket from walmart, skip the shreds of paper if your worried and just put a little blanket in there for decoration.<br>  If you dont want him to have so much candy, get jelly beans (cut them in half after the search so he doest choke)<br>  Only hide them in one room though, to make it easier for him.<br>  Help him find them too! Get on your needs and pretend your looking, point him in the right direction if he cant find them.<br>  Even count them out as you go, learning numbers starts out as just a concept, introduce it to him as early as possible! <br>  Take a picture of him and his basket, he would be so proud!You can even buy some bunny ears for the both of you to get you in the mood. All this stuff you can get at Wal-Mart or even the Dollar Store! They have TONS of Easter stuff at Dollarama.<br>  Another fun thing to do, its to make sugar cookies and get your child to 'paint' them. Just buy some regular icing. get a little food colouring, and he can go crazy with a plastic butter knife or even his fingers. When the cookie is all painted, he gets to eat it!|`|AA10325228	take him to a local farm to see all the cute baby animals<br>   take him to see the easter bunny<br>   maybe do a small easter egg hunt and let him find the eggs|`|snzlHgqraa	YES! My son was 19 months old for Easter last year and he had a great time going around and finding all the eggs. he got to help color the eggs  and make cookies the night before. we also got plastic eggs to put little hershey kisses in. leave some carrots out for the bunny to eat and make sure to leave little pieces left behind so it looks like the bunny munched on them. :)<br>  for his basket you can get a little book, stuffed animal, little packs of applesauce or crackers. fun little cheap things are always favorites of the little ones!<br>  have fun and take loads of pictures!!!|`|dPgP28Aiaa	Yeah do a little easter egg hunt in like your living room or something, to see how he'll do, and see if it interests him at all. For his basket put some age appropriate candy and toys. I'm sure he'll have a fun day. Good luck!|`|AuFjh1vraa	you should go to easter parties, color eggs, and on easter you should hunt for eggs filled with things he likes.you can do fun arts and crafts like make bunny puppet. you could also read peter cotton tail|`|AJErjGOLaa	you could hide easter eggs and then get someone to come out in a bunny suit and help him find the eggs???
qsjGSXaRaa	I see a lot of moms on this site bashing the program and I wonder just how many of them have had personal experience with it in order to place negative judgment on it. My guess is that they've only seen the commercials and looked it up online...this gives their opinions no merit, in my opinion. <br>  <br>  I've seen it work firsthand and it's really something! To address parent's concern about time in front of the television: the baby doesn't sit, "vegging out" alone in front of the T.V. The parent has to be right there, offering visual cues and showing flashcards and such. It's extremely interactive and a great way to spend time with your little one. <br>  <br>  Also, I've seen people bashing it because they feel it doesn't actually teach babies to read, but just helps them to memorize words. My argument to that is that we ALL learn to read by memorizing words! If ever there's a word that I don't know how to spell, I look at the word and my memory is what helps me the next time to recognize it and secondly, to spell it correctly. Without memorization, none of us would be able to read!<br>  <br>  While there are certainly other and less expensive ways to teach your child to read, I don't think that anyone not using the program can argue that it doesn't work. I know a 20-month old who can read dozens of words out of her little books, and speaks in 3-4 word sentences due to the fact that her mother used this program. <br>  <br>  As for me, when my baby is old enough, I just may consider using the program too!|`|heDtLdz5aa	yes i have heard of it and IMO i think it is a load of crap... reading and talking with your baby is what works..|`|w3ob12X6aa	i seen the commercial but i dont think that the baby will read it will recognize things and remember them

1thzSbS8aa	Cigarettes and drugs are not contraceptives. They do not make guys infertile. Potheads and dopeheads and smokers father children ALL the time. Even old potheads and dopeheads in their sixties and seventies.<br>  <br>  The guys just tell girls they're sterile from potsmoking, in order to avoid wearing condoms. Some of them may even believe it.|`|ZX2so3twaa	that doesn't have anything to do with it.|`|ozATw7s0aa	Take a test?|`|puEjSoDfaa	In high school, my boyfriend did cocaine, weed, acid, and god knows what else, he's been drinking since age 17 and is now sorta an alcoholic, he's trying to recover. He has 3 kids, and could of possibly had more....but thats another story, so I'm going with that it doesn't affect it too much<br>  <br>  Actually, thinking about it, when you drink and do drugs it impairs your judgements and makes you horny, so you're more likely...sorry|`|tbeO3Lataa	The drugs and alcohol directly? No.<br>  <br>  However, excessive amounts of alcohol and drugs can make a person more...horny. So, they would have sex more = higher chance of pregnancy.|`|ud0gPY3baa	I've never heard of that, so don't worry about it ( ;<br>  But drugs and smoking mess you up so maybe that could happen<br>  By the way, if he smokes and does drugs then you can be with someone better<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	smoking and drugs dont make someone pregnant....<br>  <br>  did you have unprotected sex with him ? <br>   Then YES you could be pregnant|`|kyqhMuSiaa	Smoking and doing drugs reduces fertile sperm but it's not a contraceptive you can still get pregnant.|`|RRxlVNHQaa	it makes the sperm count less && you are less likely to become pregnant. trust me i know from experience.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	if he didn't use a condom he did
RIOC6ANUaa	adorable. not overly used but not way out there.
AA10494763	It takes a while to become a foster parent first off there are classes you have to attend and a home study you need to have done.  Then crimnial background checks .   You do get money but it varies from state to state even city to city depending on need.   <br>   My county gets like 20.00 a day  but that is really high.  Most places it is like 9 or 10 a day. You won't get rich taking in foster kids and it does not cover what it cost to raise them You have to have enough already and they remiburse you. the checks are always like a month behind.
hIoxij6eaa	Don't forget to look after yourself. The last thing you need is to get sick yourself but still have to look after 3 kids and a husband!!! Sounds like you are doing all you can to keep the house germ free. I guess you've been doing the doctor thing too? Just in case anyone needs any medication?<br>  <br>  Hope everyone gets well soon!|`|PjxamRdVaa	Hmmm. Is everyone in their own room or running around with everyone else? If they are sick they need to be segregated from everyone else. That's the mistake my mom made. She always use to keep us on the living room sofa so she could watch us good, but everyone always seemed to get sick, & disinfect toilets, etc. after they finish using them. Keep hand sanitizer through out the house. Good luck & I hope they get to feeling better!|`|NPkkyD2faa	Each person drinks out of his/her own glass all Day.  Night time in the dishwasher.<br>  Hand wash to the tune of Happy Birthday often with hot water and soap.<br>   Clean doorknobs,  disinfect toys with a little bleach in a some water, soak and rinse try.<br>  Sneeze into your arms.  and tell hubby he gets the couch until he gets well or you sleep on the couch|`|e7jXVNOJaa	Everyday someone else comes home sick huh. How many children do you have in all?...|`|AA10943329	now they all have it it will go. Hopefully you avoid it. You could always "run away " from home for a week lol|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,usually once one person in a household is sick,they are a carrier,and it isn't long before it makes it's round to everyone. I advise for you to make sure you're taking your vitamin C and eating healthy. <br>  As for everyone else,do what you can for them,take them to the doc,etc.
CRvdmFwCaa	Definitly don't let him pressure you into having sex.  I think he knew what he was doing lying those out on his bed so non-discreetly.  If you don't want to and don't feel ready, don't have sex.  Once you do it changes everything.  It seems like thats alllllllll they want to do.  Forget Guitar Hero.... It'll be like... Wanna do it?  Wait until you are ready.  And just think of how you'll feel afterwards if he breaks up with you.  I'd suggest to be in a commited relationship before giving yourself to another person.  I was 14 when I lost my virginity to my boyfriend, we dated for about a year.... he promised we'd get married and be together forever... I was young and believed it (he was 17).  We'll we had sex and about 2 weeks later he broke up with me... just because.  I'm 21 now and I still hate him for it and wish I wouldn't have had sex with him... but it's in the past and I can't dwell on it.  So, Just becareful... you virginity is something you can never get back.  Take time and let your relationship  grow into something mature... not 2 teens having sex.  Go with you gut on this one "don't really want to have sex for awhile".  ALSO  My brother just turned 16 and his little friends are pervets and treat girls like princess's to their face and you should hear how they trash talk them behind their backs... it is disgusting.|`|YuPNVX9maa	Don't have sex when you're 14. Wait until you feel comfortable and sure. Also, get informed about a backup, like female contraceptive foam AND a condom, just in case you do have sex soon.|`|Bcm5Ov54aa	I think he really likes you, but if you don't want to do it then casually bring it up saying i saw the condams and i don't want to have sex yet, <br>  this happend to me and they took the info well and if i ever want to then we will be ready and safe|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Don't have sex just because you've known him for a while... 14 is way too young.|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Just tell him your not ready.<br>  If he doesnt agree, he's not right for you.<br>  <br>  If he cared he'd wait for you.|`|lTsPX04jaa	people buy condoms to have sex|`|7p9qgkSFaa	I think you should just tell him you saw the you knows and tell him you don't feel ready to do it. So you guys can keep dating and just e kissing and groping each other but no sex.|`|Q5GKWChoaa	Good for you that you are waiting. <br>  <br>  And Kudos to him for getting protection in case you change your mind.<br>  <br>  He might have been giving you a hint. Just tell him that you just aren't ready to have sex.|`|Qhyovyj8aa	He probably got them because he's expecting to have sex with you soon. Ask him about them, and tell him that you're not ready. You're too young for that anyway. Good luck.
haabfMtkaa	With my 2nd one I just new I was pregnant. I took the test and it was barley there light positive line. Sure enough I was pregnant.If you are dispersing the hormones then you are. That is my feelings on it.Those test a pretty accurate. <br>  I took the first one before i even missed my period and it came up with the same thing. Then I missed my period and took it again. I did not want to be pregnant yet I had just had a baby. The same thing happen a light hint barley there line.

Mine had a little bit of pink in it also but everyone is different, Sounds like your gonna have a baby soon!|`|IllWKAUGaa	could me...your mucus plug is generally thick though....i dont know how thick yours is but it's a posibility...it wouldnt hurt to tell your doctor, but it's not phone call worthy, you can wait until your next appointment.|`|ki3XY49daa	As soon as your cervix starts to open, it also starts releasing the mucus plug.  It's not usually an indicator of labor unless it has blood in it.  The one time I had blood in mine, I lost it all at once and I went into labor that night.  With the other ones, it was a little at a time with no blood in it.  You'll want to tell your doctor that you're losing it just so he'll know that things are starting to change in there.  It's for sure a good thing that it's coming out, but pay close attention.  You might notice that your Braxton Hicks contractions are going to get more intense.  So, hang in there...it's coming!!  :)|`|IjOEpqgOaa	whats the color of it? <br>  i'm 37wks & 3days. i been having a lot of discharge more then normal. its sometimes clear or light white-ish?<br>  <br>  i didn't know if it was the mucus plug or not! hopefully someone knows.<br>  <br>  but i been having the same thing happening to me past couple of days!<br>  <br>  congrats and good luck hun!|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	yes, your plug is starting to loosen.

mLbydsVIaa	you shoud wait about another 2-3 weeks. your still really early and there might not be enough pregnancy hormonein your urine to detect pregnancy.<br>  good luck and hope this helps :)|`|utfoP7GWaa	for me the cheap dollar store tests worked the day my period was due. when I took them (even early) and they said BFN they've always been right. sorry to be such a bummer!!!|`|em8A42Bqaa	I have taken one as early as the first day of a missed period, ofcourse it was negative, but from experience I've learned that you have to wait awhile after your first missed period a cuople of weeks and then test.  I've also used dollar store tests and they are all the same.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Not sure about the dollar store ones but they're probably just as good as drugstore ones. They usually work on the day of a missed period. Still possible though. Wait a few more days.<br>  Good luck! Baby dust to you!

HKAYbIo8aa	I never really thought about this subject until I got pregnant in December and miscarried in February.  Now I'm hearing all these stories about miscarriages and births.  They say that it is very slim that things happen during labor but still you do worry.  People tell you not to worry about things that are out of your control but it's hard not to.  I'm sure everything will be just fine.  Enjoy your pregnancy and the new little bundle of joy that will bless your home in October.  I'll be praying for you.  Best of luck!|`|cxcDP97qaa	Be as stress free as possible.  Stress comes in many different ways and all effect the body the same way, but here is 3 major "categories" that you want to be aware of:<br>  Think Well<br>  Eat Well<br>  Move Well<br>  If you don't do 1 of them, your body releases stress hormones which are linked to many things (cancer, high bp, high cholesterol, ED, diabetes, and much much more).  So by you worrying about this and listening to that song, your body is releasing stress hormones, which I would say is not good on the fetus.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you haven't been working out before being pregnant, I wouldn't start now.  Maybe take slow walks outside for a short distance, just to get some fresh air and think about how luck you are to have family.<br>  <br>  I know, I'm sorry, I'm a guy but I'm studying to be a chiropractor and believe in health rather than treating disease like medical doctors.  I know I'm biased but many pregnant women or women trying to become pregnant have found much help from chiropractors.  I just wanted throw that out there in case it helps you or even someone else reading this thread.<br>  <br>  Take care!|`|u1lcZZYfaa	My fear about pregnancy is labor itself.

AA11085356	I waited until I was 3 months. That way if anything was going to happen, it would have already.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|zSABr7praa	My mom guessed.  Over the phone, before I had even told my husband.  Mother's intuition I suppose, lol (we hadn't even told anyone we were trying, incase we ran into problems!)<br>  <br>  We told the rest of our family on christmas eve, at 9 almost 10 weeks.<br>  Best of luck and congrats!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	i told my parents as soon as i found out and i was 4w2d.|`|fHgbL046aa	Some people are so excited they have to tell family right away. They say to wait until you are 3 months pregnant because your chance of miscarriage is a lot lower. I am 21 weeks and 4 days pregnant and haven't told my family or my boyfriends family. I'm 35 and I'm not scared to tell family, there has been some minor complications. I have been thinking of a unique way to tell them.|`|DutTBV3caa	it depends. some people tell as soon as they find out and other wait until about 12 weeks (i think it is) when theres a less chance of miscarriage. it all depends on you and when you feel comfortable telling.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	we told everyone right away. I couldnt keep my big mouth shut lol. I was 4 wks along|`|AA11294818	My husband and I tried to wait for 12 weeks, because it is our first pregnancy and we wanted to surprise them and also not disappoint them in case we miscarried. We waited and waited and then they came to town and we had a big family lunch, so we decided to spill the beans at 9.5 weeks, even though we hadn't had an ultrasound or even listened for the heartbeat yet. I decided that I could handle losing the baby and having my family know, and I realized my family would want to know, anyway, and probably would be hurt if I didn't lean on them in those tough times. So my work (family members) knew at 10 weeks. I'm 12 weeks now and things are still going a-ok, and now my belly's growing bigger. I think it's personal choice when you decide to tell your family. If you're willing to be real and candid with everyone about it, then tell them! If you would rather be very private about these things, then wait. There is no right or wrong answer, and it was so funny because I was worried what other ppl would think about me telling them early or late, but it's your baby, your body, your life you can do what you want! Next baby, I'm gonna ponder a lot less on this one I think :)<br>  God bless and I hope the pregnancy goes well!|`|v0aKxF6iaa	I told my mom when i first found out but as for aunts and uncles and cousins and stuff waiting until after the first trimester is a good idea in case of a miscarriage. But really its up to you and when you want everybody to know of the little angel inside of you!|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	I was going to wait, but because I has some bleeding and needed a ride to the doctor (hubby had something important that I wouldn't let him miss).  I had to ask my mom to take me ( I don't drive) and so I had to tell her.... :(<br>  <br>  I wanted to wait til 12 weeks, or at least 8!!|`|fWAzJIEkaa	It completely depends on u sweetie!<br>  when u feel ready for it...some people wait till after 3 months!<br>  I have already told my mum - as soon as we found out i was pregnant, we told our mums! Excitement takes over and u end up telling a few more..hehe..But i will wait till past 3 months to share it with everyone else!<br>  Congratulations, and wish u all the best and a continuous healthy pregnancy!xx|`|sVPToYvKaa	I told them as soon as I found out for sure.<br>  You really don't need to wait too long because you need to get to a doctot and get on prenatal vitamins.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  If you live on your own, then tell them when you feel like the time is right!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	Whenever you are ready.  No one else can tell you that.|`|4CMx1uzXaa	Whenever you want- there are no boundaries!|`|SNLFVblhaa	around 3 months. when u start to show (:|`|AlNcvluhaa	i think that its more importantly to tell someone as soon as you find out, because you can start receiving support and your husband can start thinking about the future for you and the baby! if you have a mate..... but if you don't the people that you know can start helping you for example...parents,family members, friends, or the father of your young one. Its very important to think a ahead because, you never know what can happen, and its always best to be ready. Congrats! and i hope that youy get all the love and support needed!|`|aGYvN9pfaa	It depends on your situation. My cousin told our whole family after her first Dr. visit confirmed for sure that she was pregnant. I decided to wait until my second trimester (3 months) to tell my family since I'm epileptic and the medication I take increased the risk of miscarriage.<br>  <br>  If you are high risk for any reason, usually better to wait. If not, no reason not to spread the good news a little sooner.|`|MzjbUX5eaa	I've shared the wonderful news with my family right away with each pregnancy. The chances of miscarrying are slight but it is a possiblity. It's really up to you if you want to keep it to yourself until after your first appointment or some people wait until they are out of the first trimester. There isn't a right or wrong answer.<br>  <br>  Good luck~|`|080934e29f274b8260654d8ae8456f65aa	I recommend telling your spouse, if you have one, asap.  As far as immediate family(mom, dad, siblings) you should probably tell them pretty after you find out.  All other family, I would wait until the first trimester is over.  That's honestly the best time to tell anyone, since the odds of miscarriage are slimmer after the first trimester.|`|LtMGBsI2aa	My wife waited until after the first trimester only because that's when, If there's going to be an issue, you have the greatest chance of losing the baby.<br>  <br>  She didn't want to tell everyone in the off chance of her losing the baby.  There again though the odds of anything happening are slim at best.<br>  <br>  I told my family as soon as I found out.|`|KyWf6Wt5aa	at 12 weeks that way you are out of the clear and you know you wont lose the baby, i had a friend who told her entire family that she was prego and they got all exited she was only 8 weeks and lost the baby
xOr67VDiaa	smacking makes everything worse, mostly itmakes them hate you even more and lose respect for you. I have a 9 year old sister and she drives my mum nuts, my mum cant believe the way she talks back to her, from a person looking from the outside in, i think its best to take away the things she puts her most attention too. i think its the age, now they are starting to figure out they can do what most of us can do but dont understand their judgment isnt as good as adults. the best thing to do is remind her of what you have been doing, youre her mum and she should have respect for you, also remind her if you cant respect the ones you love then you cant respect anyone and in the long run it will be harder for her to make friends etc. also remind her ppl laugh at ppl with big mouths but they dont respect them, im sure its just her age because my sister is the same, im alway telling my sister to respect our mum because she is a good woman and loves her more than could ever be told. good luck and dont read to much into unless you think its to much for you to handle. it can also be the ppl she hangs out with at school. i think what youre doing is good but if it gets worse then you should go to dramatic messures to stop her from becoming worse, shes to young to not need her mum, so maybe you can make her realize how much you do for her.|`|MvisyrRVaa	Give her no TV, no computer, no video games, no candy, no pop, no phone, no friends....she'll get the point after a while. If none of that works, it might be something more serious. Take her to a therapist.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	Sorry to say but your daughter needs a spanking.<br>  Sometimes you have to do the unexpected to<br>  drive home a point. One spanking isn't going to<br>  harm her. The shock and embarresment of being<br>  put across your knee will have thinking twice<br>  the next time she thinks about getting mouthy.|`|rid4brOnaa	Nothing says "I MEAN NO!" like a sharp swat or 2 to the seat of her pants. Another alternative is to make each subsequent harsher than the one just before it. Do not start over. She obviously is not taking you seriously.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	start taking things away from her. take her favorite toys/things away. no phone, no t.v., etc.|`|RuyLwzA0aa	I teach 9 year olds and have learned that this is just the way they are.  Unfortunately it is illegal to slap them in the mouth every time a rude statement comes out (haha), but you should just keep letting her know that you do not accept that behavior.  Sadly, you should probably expect this treatment for the next 10 years or so....trust me she will come around.  <br>  <br>  Another thing that I wasn't aware of when I started teaching this age, was the fact that they start puberty much earlier than we did.  Chances are she could be fixing to start her period and has changing hormones causing her little attitude.  By the end of 4th grade over half of my girls have usually started there period.  When I was young it was closer to 5th and 6th grade.  Just be there for her, love her, and stay strong,  Good Luck mom!|`|6npsRIzUaa	"that I am the parent and what I say goes and that she doesn't have the right to snap back at me"<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but it pisses me off when people pull **** like that. I understand that you think you can just say anything and kids will bow their heads and listen, but it doesn't work like that. You should try sitting down with her and explaining why her actions are wrong, not just yelling and grounding her. I honestly don't think grounding or spanking kids makes them realize why what they did was wrong.|`|YL1evGq3aa	some of her friends could be mouthy to her parents possibly or the tv shows she watches. let her watch them just say "your not hannah montana"

Try not to panic about the pain and realize it might not be as bad as you think. If you let it freak you out, it can make it all that much worse. <br>  <br>  Hang in there ... it's almost over.

About being afraid, don't be. I have 4 kids . All of them were natural except for the last .. she was Cesarean. My third I had at home, by choice. Giving birth is normal , natural, we were made to do it. Women do it everyday. Once you get through it , you will see and feel the sweet rewards And feel so proud of yourself. Relax dear, stressing can affect the baby. I stressed allot in my first pregnancy, my daughter is 11 now , she is always stressed. In my third I was so relaxed. He was the best baby and still so laid back.|`|3edef8d3de65a00ff88d23cecd7bc6ffaa	yes...dont' be in a hurry to come home from the hospital...and  when someone offers to help...and you trust them......let them help.<br>  Also......the epidural is the drug of the gods!!!...and btw doesn't hurt at all....good luck.|`|JjbragXNaa	You'll get through it in a couple weeks.  And not only will it be totally worth it, you'll forget about all that stuff until you get pregnant again. ;)  Good luck, and you'll be fine.|`|KY6tgDa4aa	I know how you feel. I was right there when I was pregnant with my son. I didnt make it to 38 weeks, I had my son early. I am sure the time will pass quickly. Just focus on SLEEPING!!!

So may advice is not to tell him you aren't pregnant. But if you are pregnant and you're not playing around then tell him you are pregnant.|`|3edef8d3de65a00ff88d23cecd7bc6ffaa	somethings shouldn't be joked about......<br>  .........how would you feel if he said he was cheating on you and had sex with someone else....waited for you to cry,..and then said "just kidding".......you do the math.

TXddP0uxaa	Well, she needs a bra.  So buy her a bra.  Seems simple to me.  <br>  <br>  If you aren't sure what will work best for her, ask for a fitter to help you.  JCPenney has certified fitters that will answer any question you may have, and they also have the largest selection of bras in all sizes.  My daughter and I had a very good experience buying her first bras there.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Some sports bras are quite thick and may work. A soft cup bra would probably be a good idea for during the day. Choose one which is off-white or beige so it isn't as see-through as just plain white.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	What about a sports bra? A thicker one..|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Yes. You can try a padded bra or a children's slightly padded bra, which will hide her breasts. That's the only reason why I wear padded ones, because I have odd shaped breasts and thin bras don't help with covering my parts too well. There's a wide selection of children's bra's though, a sports bra might not work too well, since its still pretty thin. I guess it depends on the shape, though. Maybe take her bra shopping and have her try some on and see which ones she has a preference over.|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, if she needs one then by all means buy her one. A good sports bra will probably hold her in place while playing sports, and will be much more comfortable for her to get used to wearing a bra with. I would start out with a sports/training bra and see how it works, at 9 years old she would probably feel a bit embarrassed about wearing a "real" bra, so she should get one like these to get her used to the whole bra thing. They might even give her the support she needs, and if not after a few weeks of wearing the trainer/sports bra get her a real one, by that time she'll be used to wearing a bra.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10811848" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10811854" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=5684333" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10811857" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|K7H1zrCbaa	so buy her a bra|`|4XAGFz3zaa	Get your daughter a bra, like a sports bra. I'm 12 years old and my mom got me a bra when I had been ten for 4 months or so. I got one and most of the girls in my class were wearing bras. Only a few didn't but now I'm in 6th grade and my best friend who is like totally skinny and she is even wearing a bra. She weighs like 75 lb., so you can imagine what she looks like. So get your daughter a bra. But first explain to her why she needs to wear a bra. That's my opinion.|`|ZZztSumhaa	By what you explained, yes i think she needs a cupped bra. If a sports bra or training bra wont work heres what i did with my daughters.<br>  Blake is 11 but she started developing at a very early age. She was a size B cup by the time she was 10. But i took her to Kohl's and let her pick out some cute patterns and colors that she liked and she was comfortable in.|`|I8lFqyyFaa	A snug camisole with a shelf bra in it might work for her.

gtDg845naa	All women react to birth control pills differently so I couldn't tell you for sure what pill would be best for you.  You should talk to your doctor, and see if they can change your pill to something different. If your having these problems with a low estrogen pill, then try one that isn't low estrogen.  You could try a multi-phase pill if your taking a mono-phase one, or vise versa.|`|abc74a7841250ed8830346d501f162a7aa	They all have some side effects .However I was just like you I never wanted the IUD ,,but after 6 kids it was the only thing left to try ,,It went in (2 minutes most )DID not feel a thing ,It was the best and easiest thing I could have ever done , I should have done this before ...you don't feel it , you don't have to worry about it and its good for up to 5yrs no worries no weight gain !!<br>  <br>  The shot caused me headaches the patch caused me heart pains the pill made me nauseated|`|SHARt1k3aa	You are going to a quake if he told you the IUD can make it so you can't have kids.  That is a bunch of bull!  My daughter has it and she is 22 and they encouraged her to get it.  I have it as well and I LOVE it.  You don't feel anything, I have very light periods and it last for five years.  It never makes you feel ill because it isn't administered like a pill.  I highly recommend you go to another doctor and get a second opinion.  My daughter got pregnant on those low dosage pills, be careful.
ev0SHwMyaa	I took fertility for only 6 weeks and became pregnant. We had been trying to conceive for almost 3 years. I think it's definitely worth a try, it seemed to have worked for me.|`|56Ksn3Kqaa	yes i toke it for 3 months and on the thered month i got pregnant it worked for me.
opQbQVreaa	I thought about buying this product, but when I read the reviews on Amazon I decided not to (at least for the female fertilaid, may still consider buying the male kind)<br>  <br>  The female fertilaid is really only for women who have irregular periods and have trouble ovulating. I have read that if your cycles are normal and you do ovulate then taking this supplement can mess up what is already working the way it is supposed to.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	i asked this question too. I am considering buying some of the fertilaid as well. I have been trying for three months.|`|VqmaOcUIaa	What the heck is fertal aid ..never heard of it..
6npsRIzUaa	I can see where she's coming from, but I honestly think she's being way to extreme and unreasonable. I'd tell her it's your kid too and if your brother wants to see him there's no reason why he should not be able to, it's not like him seeing his nephew is going to turn the kid into a playboy. Maybe you two could find a compromise, your brother can see his nephew if both of you are in the room with him at all times ('cause I mean really, if he honestly wants to turn your son into a playboy he's not going to do it infront of you two), and maybe discuss with him which of his behaviours you find inappropriate for your child to hear so he knows to watch what topics he talks about?|`|BRT2teSqaa	His relationship issues have nothing to do with him seeing his nephew.  Your wife sounds nuts.  Talk to her about it, and if she still refuses than go behind her back.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Wow.  Your wife is a real piece of work.  First all the craziness with her pregnancy and now this.  <br>  <br>  I doubt there's really much you could do considering the fact that she's so mentally disturbed.  Your brothers relationship status in no way directly affects what kind of uncle he is.  Especially if he's just a young man having fun and exploring what options are available out there.  Its called dating, not 'being a playa'.  Even if she doesn't agree with his lifestyle, it is impossible for him to influence his nephew in any way, shape or form at this stage of his life.  I mean what does she think is gonna happen?  The infant is gonna roll over and *****-slap her and demand to 'suck her titties".  *rolls eyes*  You could explain this to her a zillion times, but I doubt it would work.  Instead, I'd just simply invite your brother over and introduce him to the baby.  If she wants to throw a fit and goes ballistic, at least you'd have the opportunity to call the men in the little white coats to come and get her!|`|ixmaM395aa	Absolutely she is being unreasonable. <br>  <br>  You brother has every right to want to take part in his nephew's life and I in fact think it's really sweet he's making the effort, because some Uncle's just don't care. <br>  <br>  Look if you've got to sneak around behind her back, then just do it. No it's not right but I think her reasoning for wanting to keep your brother away are unjustifiable. <br>  <br>  If she can't relax and let him come around at least once a month he'll feel alienated and not long after just give up. And that's not fair on the kid here! <br>  <br>  So you can either sit down and TELL her your brother will have a strong part in his nephews life or you can meet up somewhere for a fun day out with the kids. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I really hope your wife relaxes. He is your brother she needs to understand that..... and so he's living a playboy life... he could be doing worse for himself.|`|G2auAv1Saa	Yes I think she is being unreasonable. <br>  I also think you need to be the man in your own house instead of the doormat. <br>  <br>  If he is living a 'playboy' lifestyle then I think the only reasonable request would be for him to not bring around a different woman every time he visits or be under the influence of alcohol or other substances.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Yes, she's being unreasonable. You need to put on your big boy pants and handle this. These are your children too.|`|BzH7l27oaa	Wow, I can't even imagine how controlling she is with YOU if she's like this with your brother - PSYCHO is what comes to mind!<br>  <br>  btw, is it the nephew or the neice?|`|aCUHzMrmaa	That is really stupid...his relationship/love life isn't putting the kid in danger....i feel shes definitely being unreasonable.|`|AA11481889	She sounds like a control freak!<br>  <br>  I can see that she wants to protect her children and that's all fine and good...but you can BAN the world...and you can't control family members.<br>  <br>  The SANE thing to do would be to go ahead and see family and if they set a poor example TALK TO THE KIDS and explain to them why that behavior is wrong and that you hope they have the sense to never act that way and blah blah blah...<br>  <br>  But she's delusional if she thinks that by imposing iron clad restrictions that she's going to actually control what her children see and what they don't ...children aren't that stupid.  <br>  <br>  And the only thing she is actually succeeding in doing is totally alienating her husband and his family members.<br>  <br>  SACK UP Son...they're your kids too...why don't you make up some rules of your own....Like...maybe ...every other wednesday night is "Family Night" and your brother comes over for dinner!<br>  <br>  Don't hide your relationship with your brother...because then you're being dishonest.  Right now...the only person doing wrong in this situation...is HER...if you lie behind her back...then you're both wrong.  Talk to your wife...if you can't even talk to her...there's no hope in ever actually defying her.|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	I wouldn't call her unreasonable, I would call her a manipulative control freak.<br>  <br>  The two of you have a son, the TWO of you have a son. This means that you have equal parenting responsibilities and rights.<br>  <br>  Time to put your foot down, you don't have to be a jerk about it, but it is time to let her know that you have just as much input on who the child sees as she does.
VMASMHX6aa	I haven't experienced this myself although I have had 2 miscarriages and will be having some blood tests soon to see if a cause can be found.<br>  <br>  I think that it's 'good' (as good as it can be) that they've found a reason for your miscarriages. Most women who have the tests find there is no reason at all and therefore nothing can be done. But if they can do something to help you then that really increases your chances of having a successful pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!

Fd4lITkvaa	I was in an emotionally abusive home as well, you only have 4yrs left. Take pride in working hard to prove them wrong eventually. My mom discouraged me from going to college because she was sure I would just be a stripper, what kind of mom says that? Seriously? Anyway I went to college, got married, got a house, had a baby at 27 and am happy with my life. It's not perfect but it's my life and I'm not a stripper. I learned from the way my mom treated me to be careful with what I say to my son. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger, it's completely true. <br>  <br>  Most foster homes will be worse if you are lucky enough to get in to one at all. Chances are you would end up in a group home.<br>  <br>  It was so nice to tell my mom to get out of MY house when she came over and talked down to me. Soon enough you will be an adult and can distance yourself as much as you need to. You can choose to only keep healthy relationships.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I dont think you can go to foster care for those reasons.  Foster homes are ussually much stricter than that.<br>  <br>  Your parents have to pretty much be physically or sexually abusive, or just neglectful for you to be put in foster care.  Being told that you are overwieght and need to go outside and exercize isnt abuse.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I had horrible living conditions at home too, but Foster Home life wasn't the life I wanted to live either.

I know some women do have it all the way through pregnancy.|`|dNlCfhD2aa	Some women experience nausea the entire pregnancy.  Sorry!  See if your doctor will prescribe you something to ease it.|`|Adq6y8tXaa	sometimes women have morning sickness the entire time they are pregnant..|`|pjgMW6qaaa	my co worker threw up her whole pregnancy<br>  <br>  so yes its normal.
uFrqC4Y2aa	It sounds like you're pregnant. It's not usually very common to be 5 days late, pregnant, and get a negative test. Wait it out. You could very well  be expecting.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Stress, excitement, dietary changes, all sorts of things can cause your period to be late. I would wait awhile longer, say another five days or so, and if you have no show, get another test done after that.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	I would wait a few more days and test again. The symptoms you described could be from a bad case of PMS too though. All you can do is wait and see. You can also always go to your doctor and get a blood test done.|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	testing before you period is 7 days late is a waste of money really|`|H2IhRXIIaa	5 days late?? Yea go take a test..|`|pjgMW6qaaa	wait a few more days.<br>  or get a blood test<br>  <br>  <br>  best wishes|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	You have every single symptom that I have. I don't have a lot of nausea..yet. lol<br>  <br>   If it was negative you could have just ovulated later than you thought. Wait another week. Good luck and congrats on being a newly wed!!|`|9RqrVsOWaa	Everyone is different and it depends on the test you took also. I first tested at 1 day late because my boobs were severely sore and the test was positive. i'm now 7 weeks and 3 days.

If the teacher doesn't wish to do his or her job, you may want to transfer to another class and escalate the issue to your parents and the principal.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure that what you're learning from this teacher is of any use.|`|mePPZXAsaa	Next time, <br>  <br>  just say i can't concentrate when people are talking and i am trying to learn. What do you want me to do? Are you encouraging us students to talk behind your back? Are you encouraging us to cheat? <br>  <br>  No one likes bossy people, but just next time, if you teacher allows it, put on some headphones and ignore those who annoy you.<br>  I dunno when i was in highschool, when my mates used to do that, i would just tell them to shut it. Its not being bossy, its just telling them to shut their faces.<br>  <br>  I suggest you go to your counselor or dean and see if you can be transfered.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Mind your own business. The teacher knows what she is doing. Nobody likes a nosy busy body.|`|cdAQZJGpaa	tell ur teacher!|`|pcjOQDymaa	youre not bossy.<br>  lol teachers are so annoying when they tell you stuff like that.|`|ozATw7s0aa	You are not bossy, you want to learn. Tell them to be quiet. If it continues, mention it to the dean or principal.
CKnHMYHnaa	Obstetric/Gynecologist|`|kaqPSgTVaa	For pregnancy or just for general checkup?<br>  <br>  For a general checkup they usually give you a pap smear which tests for infections and sometimes STD's (it's a swab or two that looks like a Q-tip. they rub that along your cervix). They'll also check inside your vagina to make sure you are healthy. They feel your uterus and ovaries for lumps and malformations from the outside. They'll also do a breast exam to check for lumps and such. It's really not too bad. They also take your medical history and let you ask any questions you have.<br>  <br>  If it's because of pregnancy they do pretty much the same thing. The pap smear may have a few extra swabs during the pap smear and they'll go over your medical history as well and let you ask questions.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	My first visit consisted of giving out lots of medical history of yourself and the father. Blood work,pelvic exam. She'll talk to you about vitamins,things to avoid during pregnancy. You'll probably get a lot of paper work and pamphlets to read. Some doctors do a pap on the first or second visit. Depending on your symptoms,if you've had any spotting,they may want to do an ultrasound to make sure everything is okay.|`|kT7GVOosaa	depends on what you are going in for. an OBGYN is a doctor who delivers babies, does paps and deals with other problems of the women's reproductive system. if this is your first visit because you are pregnant then they will get your family history, give you a due date, a pap and maybe an ultrasound to see how far along you really are.
mXXer2xJaa	Everyone does things before they realize there pregnant that they definitely wouldn't have done if they had known but its fine, I had just got home from my working holiday & spent the first 2 weeks of my unknown pregnancy drinking & catching up with friends, I'm 15 weeks pregnant now & my lil baby is healthy & has arms waving around in there. But even so chances are pretty high your not even pregnant, I know when I was younger if there was ever an accident first instinct it to stress out right away that your pregnant, if you miss your period you may have more reason to be worried but I defintely wouldn't worry just yet. What were your symptoms when you felt funny? Easiest way to ease your mind is man up & buy the test, good luck :)|`|bxlYleZkaa	Getting drunk wont hurt your unborn, if you have one, at this early stage however I would wait quite anxiously for your period and, when it comes, make arrangements to get some kind of birth control sorted out!!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test if it's been over 14 days. Most women get positives at this mark. MANY women have fun drinking nights before realizing they are pregnant so IF you are you are fine. As long as you don't continue to drink until you know you aren't pregnant.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	when is your period due? take a test then<br>  <br>  <br>  as for the drinking, no, with my first pregnancy i got drunk when my period was 4days late, i didn't realise it was late at this point until the next day, that's when i took a test and it was positive, well actually i took 13 tests lol<br>  <br>  the egg is not yet taking anything from you (what you eat or drink) its living off the nourishment from the lining of the uterus|`|kT7GVOosaa	no you didn't harm the baby. you need to take a test at the earliest the day your period was supposed to start. you can start taking prenatal now if you think you are.|`|Pb8qUNIPaa	you should get the test, but its way too early to have harmed the baby. don't worry about that, but you should go get the pregnancy test. you've got to know, right?, so go get the test and go from there. Tracy :)|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	i drank a bit before i kkew i was preggo <br>  she is good now having a nap at 21 months|`|wjGj6uU3aa	try taking a test now i may well work, if not now try after you miss your period. remember worrying about it may make you be late too so try not to worry. i no it will be hard but just think if you are pregnant you are in a loving relationship and babies are miricles.one drinking session wont hurt the baby i did it a week before i found out and she came out perfect|`|f762b1b79baf609a926675240c6b2e95aa	Don't worry you haven't done any harm, it is possible you are pregnant, but I practically pickled my 3 kids on a drinking session before I found out I was pregnant.  I stopped as soon as I knew though and they are all fine.  You won't be the first or last woman to have had a session before finding out she was pregnant.|`|0GqYeMVWaa	yeah,you could be pregnant,its a bit early to be feeling that different though.(possible though) anyhow,maybe you actually caught an std...that can apparently make you feel feverish and sick.goto a doctor real soon and get it clarified.if you have an std and pregnant it needs to be sorted.good luck.x|`|XrKviWgSaa	wait until you miss your period and if you are the baby will more then likely be fine, just when you go to your doctor for your first visit tell him/her about it|`|wLlYnG69aa	GOD HOW OLD ARE YOU|`|HpQd2zrgaa	SUX 4 U!!!
mirOK6Bzaa	There's nothing really you can do. as long as you don't act all bitchy about it to her then she should be happy for you. You shouldn't feel bad, what-so-ever.|`|LABC73E7aa	You don't owe her anything. You have the right to be happy, and she has the task of getting the f*** over it.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	just don't say anything. She's the one with the issue so if you just avoid it, you come out looking like the better person.<br>  <br>  And I'm very sorry to hear she had a miscarriage.|`|eFtxaaPiaa	This is YOUR pregnancy.  Not hers.  Don't let her make you feel upset about it.  You are a very nice person giving her sympathy in the loses of her unborn child but right now you deserve to focus on you and the life you are creating.  <br>  <br>  I think you are all ready doing the right thing by not flaunting the fact that you are pregnant.  But celebrate the fact you are pregnant on your personal web pages.|`|fh6TgqENaa	Congratulations on your pregnancy. And my condolences on her loss, but It sounds to me that she is a bit jealous and I think you should have every right to be excited and flaunt if you want to. She obviously has issues that she need to work out but if she is talking sh*t about you like that I wouldn't hold back on any way that you may feel about you being pregnant!  No matter whom it may piss off.
WPI0Z47saa	You wouldn't have symptoms that soon so it is most likely unrelated and even if you have sex at the perfect time each month you only have a 25% chance of becoming pregnant. And a missed period is the first sign usually followed by sore or burning nipples a couple of weeks after. And you should take an ovulation test to see when you ovulate because it isn't always the standard 10-14 days after your period. This hasn't been true for anyone that I knew. The best chance to get pregnant is to have sex a couple of days before you ovulate since it takes sperm awhile to get where they need to go. Sperm can live in the body for up to 7 days during ovulation. It also takes up to 2 weeks after sex for implantation to occur so you wouldn't be pregnant yet.|`|ANsznbWsaa	If you were ovulating you have a very good chance of being pregnant.<br>  Increased discharge is a sign, I'm not sure about the yellow tint though... and I don't think you would get that symptom so early. You are barely pregnant at all if you are.... wait to take a test a couple days before you are expecting your period. If it's negative take another if you don't get your period on time.<br>  <br>  It's too early to tell anything, be patient.|`|VqmaOcUIaa	Well based on the above dates you provided you started ovulating from feb 26 so you could very well be pregnant ..however it's way too early to experience any pregnancy signs..wait 5days b4 your expected period  and you can do a first day pregnancy test ,followed up by a blood test..good luck!|`|3hDXqH4Raa	if you had unprotected sex then yes you could be...i suggest if you are not learn from this..and enjoy your sleep ins
XrKviWgSaa	right after they find out they are pregnant they should go, and the internal wouldn't have caused the miscarriage your low HCG levels would have|`|61abfb3c27511166d19130fdd59840ffaa	You should go straight back to the doctor and find out if you really had a misscarrage or not.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You doctor doing an exam would not have caused a miscarriage. You get internal exams all the time when you are pregnant they are routine. You go to the doctor as soon as possible to check for pregnancy and get started with your prenatal care. If you miscarried recently you would still have HCG in your system so it's probably from that.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	If pregnant you should go to the doctor right away. No a PAP exam wouldn't cause a miscarriage.
Nuu5zUWuaa	they will explode and milk will cover the walls..<br>  <br>  to be more precise ...like two bloated sausages|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Your breasts aren't going to be the same regardless of whether or not you breastfeed. (which is a personal choice by the way and if people decide to judge you that's THEIR problem.)<br>  <br>  Labor and delivery is painful but it's all worth it in the end. Everyone has different experiences. No two women, or pregnancies, are ever the same.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	decision about breast or bottle is still seen very much as a personal choice based on convenience. The potential stress of living with a child with recurrent illnesses, or the loss of the unique bond that comes from breastfeeding, are often omitted from the decision-making process.<br>  <br>  There is much more to breastfeeding than the provision of optimal nutrition and protection from disease through mother's milk. Breastfeeding provides a unique interaction between mother and child, an automatic, skin-to-skin closeness and nurturing that bottle-feeding mothers have to work to replicate. The child's suckling at the breast produces a special hormonal milieu for the mother. Prolactin, the milk-making hormone, appears to produce a special calmness in mothers. Breastfeeding mothers have been shown to have a less intense response to adrenaline (Altemus 1995).<br>  <br>  This calming effect is hard to measure in a society largely unsupportive of breastfeeding such as the United States, where breastfeeding beyond the early weeks is not the norm. Mothers who try to breastfeed in this climate often experience physical and emotional problems. These problems result from a lack of breastfeeding role models among family and friends, and are compounded by the easy availability of formula and a lack of access to knowledgeable and supportive health care professionals.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It doesn't make you a bad mom if you don't BF. They will grow during your pregnancy and they will get bigger as the milk comes in. If you don't BF the milk will dry up and they will either go back to original size or be slightly larger. Same if you do BF. Do what's going to work better for you and your child not what everyone tells you to do.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	I didn't breastfeed either of my children. Your breasts will grow and engorge the same way they would if you breastfed. They will be sore and leak a few days after birth, but then they go back to normal.<br>  <br>  Do what you feel is best for your baby, people are always going to have an opinion on what you do, it's your choice whether or not to listen.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|XRLbqtUbaa	They may get bigger because the milk will come in, but they will dry up eventually.  Who cares what ppl think?  U can't live your life for everyone else.<br>  <br>  If u have to (medically) have a c section there's nothing you can do about it....|`|bpZp8UjKaa	Well if you dont breast feed  they will just dry up. when I had my kids the hospital gave me a wrap to put around my breast really tight so that way it wouldnt hurt me. It's kinda like large ace bandage. Rap it around your breast tight and leave it there for like a week!If you don't do that they will hurt really bad because they will need to release the milk that they have produced and it will take longer for them to dry up.If you wrap your breast like I said your breast will be back to normal! I promise! Good luck and congrats on the baby!|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	its not a rule that you have to breastfeed although it helps your placenta go back to normal and helps you lose more weight than if you don't not to mention that it is the best thing for the baby its better than bottle due to less colick in baby's tummy.<br>  nothing will happen to your breasts. <br>  only you can be the judge of what is best for you and your newborn|`|xekNv16maa	if you breastfeed your breat will stay bigger for longer, if you dont, they will go back to the way they were.<br>  <br>  if you dont breatfeed no one will think your a bad mum, its your choice ultimately. but i really think worrying about what is going to happen to your breasts is the last thing you should be thinking about, your going to have a baby! who cares what your boobs look like?|`|kyqhMuSiaa	It's your baby and your descision. If you don't breastfeed you are not a bad mum. Your breasts will produce milk anyway. If you don't decide to breastfeed you can take tablets that will dry your milk up faster, they will just be hard and tender for a while.<br>  They don't call it labor for nothing.|`|b8f5bc89c528383d165158426b57b42faa	your dr. will give you a med. that will dry up your milk. I don't know if they will be the same or not, just depends on your genetics. Ask your dr. all the questions you want answered, that's part of their job.|`|eh9mJhhIaa	I doubt anything bad will happen to your breast. A bit of swelling and tenderness, but it goes away after a few hours.<br>  <br>  In America most moms bottle-feed their babies. You won't be the "odd woman out" if you choose this method. I for one was bottle-fed when I was a baby, but that's because my mother did not know much about breast-feeding in the first place.<br>  <br>  However, these days breast-feeding is gaining popularity against among mothers in America.<br>  <br>  Breast-feeding, although widely practiced in America, is not as common as bottle-feeding. However, until the advent of milk formula for babies a little over 100 years ago, almost all women breast-fed their babies and they came out just fine. In most countries, breast-feeding is the norm and bottle-feeding is recommended only when breast-feeding presents a danger of transferring heavy metals or other toxic substances to the child. In developed countries the main argument among some women is that the changes in breast shape as a result of breast-feeding would be rather unsightly and are best avoided in the first place.<br>  <br>  Breast-feeding does take a bit of getting used to, if it's your first time. The baby feeds from the breast by putting the entire nipple in its mouth and sucking the milk out. Sounds painful, but it's not really that painful and, after a few minutes it feels rather pleasant.<br>  <br>  By nature breast-feeding is better for the baby, but in America most moms are not too well-informed about it and so bottle-feeding appears to be the only viable choice. (More money for the dairy industry, I suppose U_U )<br>  <br>  I can say with certainty that you will save more money in the long run if you choose to breast-feed, but there are other important factors to consider when making the decision.<br>  <br>  Below is a website for La Leche League. There you can find info to help you decide whether breast-feeding or bottle-feeding is best for your child.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/nb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/nb.html</a><br>  <br>  And a webpage comparing breast and bottle.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://children.webmd.com/your-babys-feeding-breast-vs-bottle" rel="nofollow">http://children.webmd.com/your-babys-fee...</a>

They concentrate on you and what you want. They won't probe for info or press you for info you don't want to share with them. Even if you did tell them you were underage etc then I don't think they'd tell anyone. Go to the clinic with your mum as you will need the support.  As long as its what you want then its not a bad decision. Take this as a lesson learnt and try not to feel bad about what you're doing. 3 years isn't a massive gap so don't worry.<br>  Nothing's going to happen to him as long as no one tells the police - even then they'd need you to confirm you'd had sexual intercourse whilst being under the age of 15 because what he has done is still illegal.<br>  Good luck with it. x|`|X8fwBpsyaa	As Jakey explained, since you're under the age of consent, legally speaking you aren't considered mature enough to be able to give your consent to sex. So even though you were perfectly happy with it, in the legal sense it's classed as statutory rape. <br>  <br>  He's unlikely to be charged unless the police are informed, and they'd have a hard time getting anything to stick if you denied it. However there is a risk, so you guys should bare it in mind.|`|1h9DYByQaa	absolutely nothing will happen unless u or a family member report him for underage age sex....which is called statory rape! <br>  <br>  if no one is going ape **** about him getting u pregnant then i wouldnt worry|`|LABC73E7aa	He will not go to jail. GET THAT ABORTION.|`|1CVOHoapaa	Unfortunately for your boyfriend Shepherd is wrong. As a 15 year old you are not legally deemed to have the ability to consent to sex. Technically your boyfriend raped you and could be liable to that charge.<br>  <br>  It is more likely that if he were charged it would be with the offence of unlawful sexual intercourse. (USI). This offence is still deemed to be serious. <br>  <br>  If he were investigated by the police he could go to court and could go to prison.<br>  <br>  It is likely that because of your age he would be charged with the USI offence.<br>  <br>  It is unlikely that he would go to prison but not impossible.<br>  <br>  Either way he would have a sexual offence on his record. He would probably have to sign the sex offenders register. Report any change of address to the police for a minimum of 5 years and possibly life.<br>  <br>  He would also have to disclose a sexual offence to any employer who required notice of any convictions. (even a caution is classed as a conviction.). Any CRB check would show a conviction for a sexual assault so that pretty much screws his chance of a responsible job with any crb check requirement.<br>  <br>  Doesn't sound to me much like that sexual encounter was worth it for either of you. You may think you are grown up but he still took advantage of you as an adult. It doesn't seem like you thought it through, (for the sake of a couple of months!)<br>  <br>  Good luck. (Your boyfriend at least is going to need it for a few years!)|`|XVljoYZ5aa	It is against the law, its called statutory rape. Although these cases rarely go to court unless someone presses it. Don't mention his age at the clinic, and if you have an angry father, warn the guy. In the future wait until you're a little older to date older guys. Even though he's a good guy, they're not always like that.|`|NrOV6ZBtaa	i am 15 too. i totally understand about dating 19 year olds. my mom was adopted, and that was the best thing ever, because appearntly im here..lol. i think you should maybe consider adoption instead of abortion. good luck. :)|`|fh6TgqENaa	If the guy is your boyfriend and he is a good guy, why would you want to get an abortion?

BNFpkozpaa	I worked in OB/GYN for 7 years and I have never heard anything that would suggest that scar tissue would ever hurt anything.  In fact, I was born with birth defects and had many, many surgeries in my female areas and I am pregnant.  The only thing that was mentioned with my scar is that it may be more difficult to see the baby's anatomy on the ultrasound so more than one ultrasound may be needed.  I should add that my scar goes from my belly button area clear down to my female area and it had been opened several times over so there is alot of scar tissue in there.<br>  <br>  And V-BAC's are safe so I don't know what that first answerer is talking about.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Yes scar tissue from c-sections lowers fertility, and it does impair implantation.   If there is implantation you also run the risk for placenta accreta, which is life threatening to you primarily - and to any fetus you carry as well.<br>  <br>  One huge reason I worked hard to have a VBAC and try to get the word out to other moms one more reason to avoid c-sections if you can.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It can effect fertility and the ability to carry babies if they've implanted improperly on the scar tissue if it's bad.|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Not that I know of.

tbESsT2daa	Come to Canada! We have free healthcare and abortion is covered by your health card (provincial government health insurance), its anonymous, and no one goes to jail! P.S You don't need parental permission to have an abortion if you're under 16. How sweet is that eh? :p|`|aDQgLEbuaa	First off you can start out by finding out if you are pregnant.  If you are then you will eventually have to tell your mom.  It's important to see a doctor as soon as possible to make sure the baby, and you, are safe.  I know it will be hard to tell your mom at first, but she'll probably come around eventually.  Give her time though.|`|7jfPHW2naa	First, take a pregnancy test. If it comes up positive, you are going to have to tell your mom. Yeah it'll be hard but once you get it off your chest she can help. If she's not supportive turn to the father or another family member. Also see a doctor, that will verify the pregnancy and help to make sure the baby is ok. Good Luck.|`|52E9NR2Waa	there are help lines out there<br>  hope things work out for you|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	Do not get an abortion, no matter what! I am so sorry about this, truly. First thing you need to do is buy a home pregnancy test. Get a friend who can drive to take you to the grocery store, and buy about three. If they all say positive, then your have a 99% chance of being pregnant. You really need to tell your parents. I know its hard, but you have to face reality:  this baby isn't going away, and they'll find out eventually. They can schedule a doctor's appointment for you to make sure you are really pregnant. Don't tell them who the father is until they promise not to press charges- if they do, he will most likely go to jail. I'll be praying for you.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I feel so bad for you! I am very sorry about your home situation. Maybe you can talk to a friend or relative and ask about staying with them until the baby comes. I know you don't want to hear this, but you really have to tell your mother. You can't have a baby behind her back. But maybe it would be best if you don't live with her right now.<br>  <br>  Or possibly a group home could be a good option for you. I don't know a lot about these, but here is a comprehensive list. <a href="http://www.robynsnest.com/pregsupport.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.robynsnest.com/pregsupport.ht...</a><br>  <br>  My heart goes out to you and your family. I will be praying for you! Good luck.|`|JAZWe8A6aa	It sounds like you're in really deep and you've realized your consequences so that's good. As far as not being able to tell your mother, I can easily relate there but you're going to need to tell someone. If you are pregnant, you will need check-ups to make sure the baby is doing alright and everything like that. <br>  <br>  In the context of the guy who may have gotten you pregnant, yes he most likely will be put in prison for statutory rape. Even though you did agree and everything, the law says that he still should have known better. <br>  <br>  You're going to need to get support from somewhere, whether it be from school or from home, you just need a responsible adult who will be able to help you out. If you are pregnant, you can consider adoption if you'd like. Then you'll know that the baby will be raised by a responsible adult who will be able to support the baby emotionally and financially. I'd adopted and I turned out semi-okay. Just something to consider. I hope all goes well and you are able to find some good support from people around you.
52E9NR2Waa	if you are good at memorization then chemistry....if you are good at understanding concepts then physics; they're both tough but not impossible and even almost fun sometimes|`|B14GJdLVaa	It depends on what you're good at. Personally, I suck at math, but LOVE science. If you're okay with math, why not go for physics? If you find chemistry interesting, take that. It depends on what you wanna do later on education wise. If you can, why not take both?|`|Qhyovyj8aa	Chemistry.|`|qWIduy5Oaa	chemistry is easier im in it now. if you need help i can help you|`|Q1PczvzKaa	Physics<br>  <br>  Or which ur better @|`|w7fCw6WTaa	As a rule of thumb I'd say if you like Maths, go for Physics, if not, Chemistry. But really it's just whatever you find more interesting.

Have her take a test.
TXddP0uxaa	I agree with just about everything your parents say except maybe for movies.  I'd probably let you go to a movie at night so long as you were home by 10:30.|`|7Io72XtQaa	At 14 and 15 I wasn't allowed to do a whole heap of things. My mum always knew the parents of who I was going to see. I was allowed to movies at night, but mum dropped me off and picked me up and knew who I was going with. I wasn't allowed to go to parties or anything like that. If I was to sleep over at a friends mum would need to know the parents, and have spoken to them about it and make sure I wasn't going to be somewhere I'm not allowed to be. As I got closer to the age of 16 they started letting me do a few more things. But still with Curfews etc.. <br>  Hope that helped you.|`|j083iujcaa	I'm 22 and that sounds pretty similar to the rules I had at that age, and the rules that my younger siblings have to go by. I know they sound unfair to you now but when you are older and a parent yourself you will appreciate them and understand where your parents are coming from with these rules<br>  <br>  the rules will probably become more lax when you turn 16.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	your parents love you. they are trying to protect you from some things they know about, that you don't know. young girls can get raped at the beach - when my friend was 14 she was almost raped by a strange young guy who approached her in the water. he was a good looking guy who acted friendly enough, then he tried to pull her bikini bottom off.<br>  <br>  you will be 17/18 soon enough. your parents really won't be able to tell you no, at that point. and you will still have a sweet, innocent lovely view of life. <br>  <br>  your parents want that for you. don't begrudge them wanting the best for you.<br>  <br>  when you have kids you will understand how important your children are and you want the absolute best, and most happy life they can have.<br>  <br>  just enjoy being 14 :)<br>  <br>  i'm 34 and i would love to be 14 again. life is sweetly simple at that age.<br>  <br>  add: i say start letting up on some of the rules at 16, as long as your being responsible and doing well in school. 17/18 would be when they have to turn you loose on the world ;)<br>  <br>  just be a good kid and make good choices. your parents will be worried if you dont and they won't trust you. the more 'good' choices you make, the more freedom they will give you.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|plI0WOrUaa	Honestly, I can understand your parents view.  I didn't when I was your age either though.  I had a lot of the same restrictions that you did.  Going to concerts and stuff like that I wasn't allowed to do either.  Only if a parent was with us.  I had to have a lot of supervision also when I was your age.  They are really just trying to make sure that you stay hanging out with the right people and don't get into any trouble.  I know it sucks, but they really do know what they are doing.  It will get better with time i promise.  They just want to see that you are responsible and capable of making adult choices.  You can't always make the right choices for yourself right now, even though you think you can.  Believe me, been there.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	I'm only 21 and I completely agree with your parents rules.  There are a lot of sick people out there that like to go where younger kids go and do things to them and get them to do things, etc.  Your parents sound like they're just trying to protect (which is what a 14/15 year old needs).  And believe it or not, when parents say they trust you but don't trust other people, they're normally not just saying it... They actually mean it.  Just give it some time.
6abac3be50d91560d04014c568e29929aa	That doesn't sound too strict to me. I'm sure that in a year or two they will let you do more stuff. My parents were not strict at all and I really wish they had been. A lot of bad stuff in my life could have been changed if they had just given me a curfew and paid attention to where I was going. <br>  <br>  No parents are perfect, but it sounds like your parents are really trying to think about your best interests. You might hate not being able to go to the beach with your friends right now, but at least you know your parents love you and want you to be safe. <br>  <br>  The next time you want to go on an outing and they won't let you ask them to be chaperons! Maybe if they attend a few outings with you and your friends they will gain more confidence in them and you.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	All that sounds fair to me and sounds pretty much like my parents rules at the age (umm, 14 years ago!).  A 7pm movie sounds like a night movie to me...  As for the beach, I might allow a 15 year old to go to a public, popular beach during the day.  I'd say a 16 year old would be ready for most of the stuff on your can't do without a parent list.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	My thoughts and opinions are that those are your parents rules and you need to follow them and learn to be a responsible, mature, respectful and productive member of society.|`|5jLEtjYxaa	Ok, the only thing i have a problem with is the go to beach...you should be allowed to go to the beach without your parent, you can bring friends that your parents know with you, and a cell phone. Going to the beach would be just like the mall, so there isn't really a difference for me. im 13 going on 14 so thats what i think is fair.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	I think the rules are good.<br>  Some parents are more strict than that.<br>  <br>  But if you want your parents to let you do more stuff without a chapereon than just earn their trust by obeying all their rules and don't rebel against. It make take a little time but earning your parents trust is worth it in the end.<br>  <br>  But just know that they make thoses rules because they care about you and want you to be safe.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Your parents love you very much and are just trying to protect you. You should read some of the other questions posted on this site by kids the same age as you. They all involve being pregnant and not knowing who the daddy is!<br>  <br>  They just want what is best for you and are providing you with that in the best way they know how. It sounds very reasonable for your age. My oldest child is 8 years old and he will have a very similar set of rules. Privileges will come with age. Give it a little more time. Keep showing them they can trust you and you may even find them more open to the idea of you driving in a little over a year.|`|ucyRQfZoaa	It's true that they love you and just want you to be safe.  You will have the rest of your life to do all those things so just take it easy and be glad that you have a family that cares.  My folks were divorced, didn't care what I did or when, and I ended up pregnant and an alcoholic.  I'm old now, but just be thankful.
TXddP0uxaa	So long as your partner has no sperm count deficiencies, there is no reason to wait until a specific time.  Just have sex every day or two and try not to focus too much on it.  In general though, most women ovulate around day 11-14 of their cycle.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way, it is now March 4...if you have a 28 day cycle you are due for your period any day now.  If you don't get one in a day or two you should go ahead and test.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	asap. just do it everyday if possible|`|OWDspwDUaa	Whenever and as much as you want lol. You usually start ovulating about 14 days after your period so if I were you I'd start trying to get pregnant around the 28th. Good Luck!!!!|`|TN6IQYoPaa	<a href="http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calculator" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calc...</a> <br>  this will tell u your most fertile periods for a few months!!|`|sSRHQkROaa	i would just do it everyday...more than once if you want to...or do it every other day so you don't feel like you're doing a task rather than making love..|`|1veacHkjaa	when mucus appears and your temperature drops|`|ad9a3HBJaa	all the time! as much as possible. mostly right after your period has ended|`|Q1I4PhO1aa	do it as much as possible!
WGAFP6mSaa	Well, apparantly, he can't make up his mind. It either he like you or he doesn't, but he's showing both towards you. All he needs is time. Time will allow him to figure out his feelings for you and his ex.<br>  <br>  After a while, ask him where do you two stand, if he continues to change the subject, I'm pretty sure he's just not that into you anymore.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	Well, you don't have to completely avoid him, but try not to focus on him so much. When you and your group of friends are together, don't look at him often and if you do catch his eye just smile. You don't have to say anything. <br>  I think what he needs is time to sort out his own feelings between you, him, and his ex, and maybe the break will allow him to do that. <br>  For now just hang out with friends on the weekends and maybe at school go off with a few of your friends so you're not always around him.|`|dDHtziQEaa	kill yourself|`|FEStjFIRaa	hes just makin excuses to let you go!!!!<br>  forget him!!!<br>  make more friends!!!<br>  be  cold with him!!!|`|I64JOuMKaa	guys say a lot of stuff to just make us happy.<br>  If he really didn't have feelings for his ex he wouldn't have broken  up with you. When my ex broke up with me I heard everything from "i need time to figure myself out to im losing feeling for you"<br>  My ex wasn't the feelings kinda guy either so he just started avoiding me in every way possible. <br>  <br>  I really think that if he's not even sure if he likes you or not, then you should just give him the cold shoulder.<br>  Show him you don't need him, that you can be without him and that you're strong . Try your best not to look at him, dont text him dont call him don't talk to him on aim/msn even if he msgs you first.<br>  <br>  After awhile, he will realize what he's lost .. and that you were sucha great girl and he broke up with you for no reason. If he comes back and wants a second chance, only give it to him if he shows you he wont hurt you again and if he will commit to being with you.<br>  If not, you deserve better =) sorry WE deserve better.

ds5MCdS5aa	Oh brother.<br>  Look Sweetie: Your wife's body is doing the most difficult of jobs right now.  Unfortunatley, there is nothing that a man's body goes through that is comprable.  You havn't said whether or not she is like this when she is not preggers.  If she isn't, just suck it up for these last few weeks.  Her body is going nuts right now.  She is feeling ugly, she is feeling fat, she is feeling so tired that, honestly, there is no way to describe it.  On top of all that, you are not "turned on" by her, and it sounds like you have told her that fact (bad move) so she has THAT to deal with as well.  Yes, it sucks for you right now.  No, it will not be forever. Please don't stop doing what your doing.  She needs you!  She is having your child for Heavens sake! And, dare i point out that you are doing what thousands and thousands of single Mom's do every day of their lives?  Please.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	That is actually a normal guy reaction.  You are not wrong to feel how you feel.  I will let you know though that during this last trimester it is extremely difficult to have energy.  We are very tired at this point, so as for the laziness, that is going to be a part of this for the remainder (until she gets the urge to nest, then she will most likely have the house sparkling).  She also works 20 hours a week, that may be all the energy reserve she has right now, so yes, she is leaving you with most of the work and postpartum it will be the same for a month or so, but you will get your wife back eventually.  I'm just surprised that she wants so much sex, I'm just the opposite, it's uncomfortable and I'm just not interested but I know my husband needs it or he'll lose his sanity|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Oh honey....Forewarning....probably not going to get any sympathy here.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you need to vent, then buck up an go talk to her. Don't be mean or accusatory. Just say, "i'm feeling a little overwhelmed with all that I have been doing around the house. I know you are pregnant but I'm exhausted from working 60 hours, cleaning the house, making dinner and putting the girls to sleep. I don't think I can keep doing this without a little more help."<br>  <br>  I don't want to sound insensitive because I know being pregnant is hard but I think she is a little lazy and you are helping her be that way. Stop making dinner, stop cleaning the house, stop putting the girls to bed. Work late and come home late for about a week and see what happens. I was in beauty school up until 2 weeks before my due date  on my feet cutting hair all day (for no pay), picking up my daughter at daycare then coming home to have dinner ready so that my husband and daughter could eat. After that I cleaned the house and definitely pass the heck out later but I felt like being pregnant was any reason to not take care of my family. My husband would have taken care of the home stuff if I asked him. She IS being lazy. Time to tell her (in a nice way of course).|`|KdqaGnlwaa	I'm not going to bash you, but get ready for a lot of bashing. I am currently 22 weeks pregnant, and am really active around the house. I have a full time job, and I go home and cook and clean and wash and fold. BUT... your girlfriend/wife is 6 weeks away from giving birth, so I can imagine how she might feel tired and lazy lately with a big ol belly. Also, I have a husband who keeps me on my toes. Don't get me wrong, he understands that I am pregnant and there are days when I am just tired and don't want to do nothing, and he will do stuff around the house, but not all the time. Maybe you can TRY talking to her and asking her to do what she can around the house, but in a loving caring sort of way. When my husband asks mes to do things, I do it because I want to make him happy. He is a wonderful man and whatever I can do to keep him happy, I will try. <br>  <br>  As far as not having sex with her.. sorry I can't help you there. I'm overweight and my husband has never complained about it. And I am ALMOST half the person I was when we met, but then again that was like 8 years ago. It's only 6 more weeks till this is over, and after that you will probably have to wait 6 MORE weeks before you can have sex again. Think about it.|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	baby is 6 weeks away ... she is tired..you try lugging around a huge belly....strain on your back and hips.<br>  <br>  i help as much as i can...which isnt much.<br>  i work 9 hrs a day and am in week 29 of pregnancy.<br>  my husband recently got laid off and is a god-sent...he just helps me in whichever way is possible.<br>  <br>  i feel huge already, why not just love her.|`|zxhCy80eaa	(God why can't men get pregnant?) I can understand your frustration to some level. Perhaps she could try a little bit more towards the housework.(I am 4 months pregnant and do all the housework. Then again, I am a stay at home mom.) My husband however has been extremely wonderful and understands if I don't cook beside smelling or looking at food sometimes can trigger nausea. He also painted the baby's nursery this past weekend. He refused to let me do it. And he works just as many hours as you do. I am blessed with a wonderful husband.(Although at 8 months pregnant, it could be a little debilitating for your wife being so close to delivery). If you think YOU have a problem with her weight (we'll get back to that in a second) imagine what the poor girl has had to carry around with her for the past few months. (Have mercy on your soul if you dared to say such a thing to her about her weight!) What was your wife's pre-pregnancy weight? You know it's unhealthy for the baby for a woman to lose weight during pregnancy (as well as gaining excessively over 25 pounds of her pre-pregnancy weight.) I pity the fact that men base their ideal images of women based on what they see in a magazine. I doubt very seriously you yourself are GQ material... be honest. If women were just as shallow, very few men would be getting sex at all.(Don't you think your wife would prefer banging Johnny Depp or one of the Chippendale dancers over you?) Don't be so judgmental. That woman is bringing your child into this world and deserves respect. You had the easy job (5 minutes of pleasure.)  <br>  She has probably less than a month to go and she will probably be the one doing diapers and midnight feedings after her recovery. For which you will be grateful. And bodies do need time to recover. If you hang in there, you'll see that 9 months was a small price for the little miracle coming into your life.|`|xWYKqcDjaa	Just wait till the baby comes... she cant do much right now, sometimes it literally hurts her to walk around, let alone clean the house. I work at star bucks too, and its hard work. You deal with people putting you down all day, (along with any other job) and then come home to a husband who doesnt even feel attracted to you anymore... how is she supposed to feel? You can talk to her about it, saying you need some help. Or maybe if you just spend more time with her, that'll help too.|`|xkSuKSn8aa	My husband never helped with the house until we had three kids, I got a job, and we built a 5000 sq ft house. <br>  I did all the housework thru all my pregnancies, I even did laundry the day I came home after my second!<br>  It is hard to reason with a pregnant woman, but give it a shot. <br>  Enlist the girls' help, and make it a family affair.<br>  DO NOT treat her like a child and scold her. <br>  Tell her it freaks you out having sex with your son inside her.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Cleaning sucks when you are pregnant. You are tired, your body is sore, everything. It seems like an excuse, but she is growing a human being in her body right now. If you are concerned about her weight, then start making fruit and veggie trays for her. Don't cook high fat dinners. I know this is hard on you but it will be like this for a while. Ask her to do a couple things around the house, like wash the floors and do laundry and you will take care of the rest. This is about partnership and it isn't fair for her to put the all the responsibilities on you, I completely agree. You need to talk to her about her behavior and try to reach an agreement. when this baby is born it will remain the same. Im speaking from experience. I never ever got that heavy in my pregnancies, but I was LAZY! Not because I wanted to be, my body just felt dragged down.. Good luck!
b073P2Wkaa	It sounds like a serious case of nerves to me. :-)  Don't worry.  Of course if you have been having unprotected sex you could be pregnant, but you wouldn't feel sick yet and your boyfriend wouldn't either.<br>  <br>  Wait it out another day to see if your period comes then take another test.  You may have tested too early in the first place.<br>  <br>  Everything will be fine!  Good luck!|`|zYBLzO9Naa	My boyfriend and I were both sick when I first thought of the possibility of me being pregnant. Which I am now, and we both are still sick.<br>  Funny, huh?|`|d3jtRA8caa	Yes if the guy is connected to you enough he may get your symptoms.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	My mom said my dad did with both me and my brother and my ex brother-in-law always got sick when his girlfriend got pregnant...even before it was confirmed.|`|MKnpH4XKaa	Well with my first pregnancy my boyfriend felt sick.<br>  <br>  with this pregnancy now his family is feeling sick like his mom and his moms sister its pretty odd.<br>  <br>  if u don't get ur period soon take another test.|`|59GymH27aa	I had a fab pregnancy with barely any pains or discomfort.  However, my partner had sickness, leg cramps, and severe tiredness.  I thought it was so strange, so I looked it up and apparantly doctors believe that they are sympathy pains.  A study showed that 3 in 25 men get them.|`|zxhCy80eaa	Yes. This is called "Couvade Syndrome". My hubby had this at the very beginning of my pregnancy. He got nausea which was great for me since I somehow skipped the morning sickness part of this pregnancy for the most part. He also got cravings and heartburn, lol!|`|4uJ3asPVaa	Old Dominican Wives Tales say that if a woman climbs over a man after sex he gets all the nausea craving & all tht other good stuff from pregnancy. My Brother in law hated sweets & while my sister was pregnant he wud actually crave cakes & candies! LOL maybe u climbed over him!?|`|tGt39Z6Yaa	Im sure every guy that did not plan the pregnancy got sick when he thought she was pregnant.
vEv2YwWdaa	If you are so worried about getting pregnant that you should not be having sex.  Sex can lead to a baby, if you are not ready for a baby then you are not ready for sex.|`|BzYbEa6Taa	Any time you have sex you run the risk of pregnancy even on birth Control { my almost 4 year old is the proof of that}.  IF your that scared and don't want any one to know I recommend buy a test on line and having it shipped to you.  No one will know how ever if you are pregnant you do need to go to the doctor and get taken care of a healthy baby starts with a healthy mother.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  ~A~|`|3edef8d3de65a00ff88d23cecd7bc6ffaa	if you are concerned...go to your family doctor...or walk in clinic and have blood work done...you'll have the result shortly after that..|`|3OeE8kMQaa	So wait? The condom fell off inside last night?!?!? Go get plan B!!! It will be much less embarrassing to go and do that then bringing a baby to homeroom! If you have sex there is always a chance you may become pregnant, even if you use precautions, thats why it's an adult thing. Every time you switch birth control methods there is usually a period of adjustment where they loose effectiveness. Good luck.|`|UEAzzroAaa	If you have sex you can get pregnant, its simple. Wait it out take a test, but most likely its because you switched bc methods.|`|0LQ5CuL0aa	take a test.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	OK.  First off, you need to take a test.  Go buy some in another town if you need to, but really, if you're not old enough to face the embarrassment, you're not old enough for sex.  Buy several.  The dollar store ones are fine.  Use your first morning urine.<br>  <br>  Next, If you're just getting to your period week on the pack, why do you say you're three days late?  I'm confused.  When did/will you take the first pill for the fourth week?<br>  <br>  About the pills--if you have been taking them correctly, which means every day at the same time, you will probably not get pregnant from last night.  You could even skip the ones for this week altogether, there's nothing medical in them.  They give them to you to keep you in the habit of taking them.  You are still protected.  However, NOTHING except keeping your pants zipped is 100%.<br>  <br>  Now, if you are pregnant at this time, it's not from last night.  If there is an embryo, it takes several days to implant, and then several more before your body builds up enough hcg for it to show on the test.  So if you are late and the test shows positive, you are pregnant from previous sexual activity.  If the result is negative, test again in a week or so.  You would not know for another several weeks whether you got pregnant from last night.  If both of these tests are negative, wait another two or three weeks and test again.  If that one's negative, take one more a week later and then you can feel reasonably sure you aren't pregnant.  (You see why I said to get several tests.)<br>  <br>  It might be possible for you to take the morning-after pill, but I don't know, since you are already on bc.  If you do take it, and are already pregnant (from earlier) you will still be pregnant.  It would only prevent conception from last night.  After 72 hours it won't work.  <br>  <br>  I live in a small town, too.  The best way not to get pregnant and not to be the subject of wagging tongues is not to have sex.  Nobody ever died from NOT having sex, no matter what your boyfriend tells you about blue balls!  <br>  <br>  Your late period, if it is late, could very well be from changing birth control, but also you could be pregnant.  It takes at least one cycle before you are fully protected, so if you had sex a couple of weeks ago, you could have conceived.  Next time please read the directions!<br>  <br>  I hope that you are not pregnant.  If you are please consider adoption.  You are too young to be a mom.<br>  <br>  If I can help you with any other questions, you can send me an email through Yahoo Answers.|`|KNyotuRYaa	Most likely you are not pregnant.Its probably because you switched birth controll,the shot can totally mess up your cycle trust me I know.I was on it for years.It might take a few months for your system to regulate itself.If you are worried take a test,have a friend get it for you If you are afraid to.|`|tnOZ49JQaa	Did you get the condom out? Even if you are you won't be able to find out for a couple of days. But if you constantly taken your birthcontrol you should be okay!|`|5yJdpf3caa	It is WAY too early to know.. <br>  <br>  If you still haven't gotten your period in 3 weeks... Go to a town like 15 miles away to buy a test if you are that worried about other people finding out.|`|4ZbJhWuxaa	its probably because you are doing your first month of pills. and if you had sex last night and the condom fell of you wouldn't get a positive test yet not till next month or something. good luck|`|vXlrA4oMaa	No, just fat in all likelihood.
aUKa1rzhaa	They all hate their car seats.. then it's the seat belts.  They make these laws for a reason.. 6 months old is way too young for a forward facing car seat.. even if she tries to sit forward.. her seat belt is still holding her back.. The age matters more than the weight...Trust me,  they freak out in forward facing ones too!!  :)|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	One year, that's when her neck muscles will be strong enough to endure a car crash, god forbid it happens.  If she's growing out of the infant seat you can buy a bigger carseat that can be installed rear facing.  Good Luck|`|Wjdpm4xNaa	Its 20lbs AND 1 year old.  So you have to wait until she is 1.|`|YVBXMghXaa	Legally it is one year AND 20 pounds, though it is safest to leave them rearfacing as long as possible.  Age is important because of spinal development.  The spinal cord isn't properly fused to the skull base until at least the age of 2.  In an accident, force that would break an adult's neck, would internally decapitate a baby.  Today is my son's second birthday and he is still rearfacing.  Most convertible seats rearface up to 30-35 pounds.  Check crash tests videos on youtube.  The difference in neck support is amazing to see.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	its minimum 20 pounds AND minimum 12 months, not one or the other, it has to be both. you can take her out of the infant carrier and get a 3 in one car seat that can go rear facing and then transition to forward facing...|`|iOSEVRPPaa	She needs to be 1 year AND 20 lbs, not one or the other.  Both I believe.|`|zYQf6y0uaa	At least one year old and HAS to weigh 20 pounds.  HUG!!|`|avkZGv1taa	Each state may have different laws, but in most it is 1 year AND 20 lbs... that being said, many carseats can be kept rear-facing for much longer (some up to 35lbs).  It really is much safer for baby to be rear facing; in the event of an accident their head cannot fly forward--even a baby with great head control is not strong enough to counter the impact.  I would encourage you to keep your baby rear facing as long as you can--even if she hates it... maybe get a mirror so she can look at you in the rear-view?|`|LhV8D2Xeaa	You could get the car seat that i bought. it is rear facing and foward facing and your child can ust it for the whole time. i put my son in one at 4 months cause he weighed 25 pounds. i had it rear facing of corse they have to be 22 pounds and 1 yr old to be in foward facing carseat.|`|AA10035322	They have to be a year old and at least 20 pounds (in Virginia) i do believe because of an collision her head would swing forward and even though they can hold there head up she would not be strong enough to withstand a jerk like that.|`|jivtit0Eaa	1 years old|`|bf6fb0f4caadf24cfa826edc2cc32d3baa	She will be fine. the main thing is that they have enough control of themselves to sit well and control their head.
DNygQdmVaa	usually theyll induce you before your 3 weeks over.|`|ndO6MiQaaa	you can only wait 10 days after ur due date then hospital will bring u in to start u
s4LWmcTjaa	Honestly yes I do.  It poses less confusion for the child(ren) to see their mom and dad unified in one faith and system of beliefs.  And for me, the  Bible clearly states that I am not to be unequally yolked to an unbeliever.  Those are direct commandments from God to me and I take that to heart.<br>  <br>  But that's my beliefs.  I simply see it as more reasonable for a child to not have the confusion of being pulled in the direction of two belief systems rather than to be raised in a home where mom and dad agree on their beliefs.<br>  <br>  However I will add on here that we do fully plan on teaching our children about and exposing them to other religions for their own education.  We even follow some Jewish practices that are in the Old Testament of the Bible.  Judaism is where the roots to my beliefs began.  My husband and I will share with our kids the gospel of Christ, but in the end it's up to our kids to make the choice to follow our beliefs or not.<br>  <br>  *Des- I believe it is in 2 Corinthians 6:14:<br>  "Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness?"<br>  <br>  I know I'll get crushed for posting that scripture because of it saying "what fellowship does the righteous have with the unrighteous" and so forth, but that is what God commands of me.  And honestly, I take that as God telling me that before I knew Him, the best I had to offer was not righteous in His eyes.  So only through Him am I even considered righteous.  I don't hold myself up as being better than anyone else because in my own good works I am no where near worthy of God and His salvation.<br>  <br>  *Maureen- and don't some non-religions such as atheism or agnostics hold the tenant that believers are wrong as well?  It's a two way street.  No one can force religion (or lack of religion) on anyone.  God didn't force you to love Him because He give us free will to choose to accept Him or reject Him.  The choice is yours.  So in essence, you are not rejecting me for my beliefs, you are rejecting God.  And you are free to make that choice without receiving any grief from me.....<br>  <br>  Ok I'm done. :)  I don't know if it made sense, but I just felt I needed to share that.  No hard feelings though.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Personally, no, I don't think it's important.  But, in our house, we encourage everyone, kids included, to find their own spiritual path to fit their own needs & way of thinking.<br>  <br>  Some religions, though, hold the tenet that non-believers are bad people or, at least, wrong.  I'm not sure how someone could believe a religion like that and still be in a relationship with or show respect to the other parent to the children.  I just don't see how that would work & still be honest.<br>  <br>  TxMom - I agree with Des.  You don't understand the meaning of the word 'agnostic'.  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a><br>  And, yes, some atheists would have difficulty being in a relationship with a person who believes in a God.   I would guess that such strongly held opposing beliefs would make for a very disrespectful relationship between them, whether they were parents or not.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	It would be nice so there isn't a power struggle between the parents. My husband is supposed to be Catholic (but he really doesn't attend church anymore) and I'm a non-denominational Christian, but we do not argue over the love of Christ.|`|j2mRop0laa	No. My father was raised mormon with 16 brothers and sisters but stopped practicing when he married my mom, who is an atheist.<br>  <br>  They sent me to Sunday School at one of their best friends churches. Baptist Holy Roller preacher. lol<br>  <br>  I learned a lot about different religions and I was taught to form my own opinions.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I have a friend who is raising the child with two beliefs(trainings). They have managed to make it work so I don't see why it should be a problem. The kids 16 now, good kid.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No as long as the parents can agree on what religion the child will be raised as.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It's very important.  Separation causes division.  Are you going to disagree on the different disciplines for your child?  One parent believes in spanking and the other does not, so you do what you believe and the parents are upset with each other and the child is confused.  So then what are you going to ask the child if he prefers spanking or not?  The child is there to be taught not to choose his teaching.  The child knows when there is division and will likely not believe either way because he knows that it's not that important to the parents.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Not really. I think it opens the door for the child to be accepting of differences. I think most religion has the same purpose- to help people be better people and give people hope (not always successful and sometimes radical.)<br>  <br>  In addition- I would like to say that it depends on family dynamic too. If religion is #1 above all else to one parents family, it may cause major rifts which is never good for a child.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	nope as said above i think its better to discuss before even thinking of babies and you would go abot raising a child under the circumstances. but im a big believer that the child (well ten as they will be old enough to make that kind of desicion) should choose either way...parents should guide only without persuasion when it comes to religion.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Well, my answer is going to be biased because I grew up in a Mormon/Catholic home (not to mention all the other varieties of Christianity from extended family.)<br>  <br>  I don't think it is important at all.  I was given the opportunity to choose either or any other religion I liked (I did try out both and many others...decided atheism suited me better.)  My brothers both decided to go with my dad's religion, their choice, they like it.<br>  <br>  My parents however would at this point in their life, disagree with that.  They are going through a divorce (a lot of blame gets thrown around and "you aren't in my religion" has come out a few times.)  They also both feel as though my atheism is "their fault," and blame each other for that.  Lol...I TRIED to explain my lack of belief has nothing to do with them...can't get through to some people.<br>  <br>  Guess it just depends on who you are and what your views are in life.  My husband is a Catholic...and clearly I am not.  So far...there are no problems (and we even agree that our son won't be baptized as a baby...imagine that, two total opposites AGREE on a religious ritual!)  *Well...that's a ridiculously long answer, lol|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't think that it is necessary for parents to share a common religion, but i do however feel that it's important to speak about these things before having kids that way there is no conflict between sides about how the child should be raised in reference to religions!|`|ddP3klT3aa	Not really. But this should be discussed BEFORE trying for a baby. How you want to raise the child, religion, etc. In the long run its the child's choice though.|`|veO1RXrCaa	We don't share one.  Im Roman Catholic and he is basically a atheist.  He goes to church with our son and I when needed.  And supports my decision to raise our son the same faith as me.  Its never caused us any issues.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	No. My husband and I are from different religions and it has never caused a problem with our children.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I think that it can clear up a lot of problems if they do.  If you are religious and you believe that the only people going to heaven are those that share your views, the last thing you want is for your husband and children to have a different religion.  While there are no guarantees I think that parents hope their kids will follow in their footsteps in terms of religion.  If there are 2 religions- it makes it more difficult to pull the kid your way.  My bf is Native American, so while he is a Christian, he also believes in other things that have to do with his culture.  He cannot wait to tell our son; while I am not thrilled, I do think it is important for Jax to know his history.  I am the one who had the baby with the Indian, so I have to reap what I have sown...|`|NflZdoOzaa	Absolutely.  Most religions shape people's ideas about children should be raised, when/where/if to go to church, etc.  The preacher at my church emphasized this by asking us, "If you marry someone who does not believe the same as you do and you die, who will take your child to church?"<br>  So basically, if you go every Sunday without fail and are considering marrying someone to whom church is not important, beware.  That person will decide your children's church habits should something happen to you.|`|9ff653285dcca235b469d9b2b3442377aa	Personally, when my Husband and I had our two children we both agreed that religion is a personal choice and that our children are free to pursue their own beliefs when they are old enough to make the choice for themselves.<br>  <br>  I don't want my children to simply believe what I do...just because I do.  We give them incite and share with them what we know of different religions...but ultimately it's their choice not mine to make.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	No<br>  but it IS important for them to not argue<br>  there is nothing worse than two parents arguing infront of a child<br>  i am a christain, my wife is agnostice, we love each other, and respect each others religion, or lack of<br>  our child goes to church, but he is open to other religions|`|Grt0HdLYaa	Na. I think growing up exposed to two faiths may foster tolerance in children.|`|AA11537580	no, it makes things easier but it isn't necessary
G2auAv1Saa	Absolutely. <br>  As a Christian I believe it is my job to pass my spirituality and religion to my children. If they don't believe it when older, at least I did my part- but I believe in Proverbs 22:6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	For us, it is paramount. It means more to us than a lot of other things do - but we try to integrate them equally into what we teach our kids. My husband and I both believe that with all the challenges that our children are facing in this world, they have to have some solid spiritual education (along with what we teach them outside of religion and spirituality) to help them make better decisions. It goes hand in hand with other things we're teaching our kids (respect, discipline, etc) but hopefully together will encourage them to be the best people they can be someday.|`|4gZYucHMaa	No I don't think it's important,Let me explain.<br>  <br>  I don't believe myself however I do answer my children's questions as well as I can. They come up around the obvious, Christmas and Easter and my daughter has asked about Noahs Ark. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's high on the list of learning for my family but I do not shy away from answering any question that they may have.<br>  <br>  It's impossible for an athiest to believe in spirtually teaching, it goes against the grain of what  an athiest is.|`|AA11210211	Not really but I am an Atheist,so spirituality means nothing to me,I think what is important is to teach them to believe in their self and what they can do for their self.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  lol Yes I do think it is important to teach children morals and values.Otherwise they will be heathens and end up in prison.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I do believe that children need a spiritual foundation so when they are adults they have a background to base their own decision on.|`|cteyFJxhaa	I believe in honesty at all times.  To others and most importantly to yourself.  I believe that the only way to sleep well at night is with a clear conscious.  I believe that hard work is rewarded and helps to keep us grounded.  I believe that the world is round and what goes around, comes around and have therefore really stressed to my kids "do unto others".  Because I believe in these things wholeheartedly, I try to teach them to my children.<br>  <br>  But I have never taken them to any church and they have never been baptized....I'm not going to get into why I disagree with most organized religions, lets just say I do.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I suppose my point is that although I believe very strongly in most "Christian" values I don't feel the need to teach religion to my kids.<br>  <br>  Add:  Well put Amber W....We can all have our own "spirituality" without necessarily sharing it in a church with others but we must all give our children a moral compass.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I am just going to say this..anyone who says no... teaching morals and values is something that ALL good parents do..and some do consider that "spirituality" So, my answer is of course YES!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Yes I do, I'm a big believer in God and my children will know the same.<br>  <br>  ETA- I understand we all have different beliefs but to thumbs down me because I believe in God and want the same for my children? Wow|`|113FoyMFaa	No.<br>  <br>  I don't think that's something that should be taught.  If you teach it to your children, that's what they're going to believe.  I wonder what people would have faith in if they searched for it themselves and weren't told what to believe at such a young age.|`|s6emVQleaa	Well, since I am a Christian, I think that raising my children to know God is the most important thing I can do for them.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I am a BIG christian so it DEF. something I WILL instill in my children.|`|AA10186411	Very much so!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Yes, I do.|`|Di6FAQxRaa	I think it is. I teach my 4 year old to pray to god and acknowledge jesus. I am very spiritual but not religious, i go into many different churches..hindu, muslim, catholic and christian churches, We are all spirits and we ned words from the bible to feed our spirits.|`|CydUZ36aaa	yes, i dont have any children yet, but my parents always teach me religion, and i'm pretty grateful that they do it now that i'm a teenager|`|Heyz3xp9aa	it is important at an early age because they will then grow up with it, and are more likely to be respectful and happy as they grow up|`|cAtWxJG1aa	No, not spirituality, but I do think morals and ethics are important.
gx4s68s8aa	Depression in pregnancy is pretty normal, and yet few people talk about it.  I guess few people want to admit that they feel low and down while the should be "happy" about everything.  But regardless of your age or where you are in life, pregnancy is a big change.  And it is big change to deal with as well as all the pregnancy hormones that are so rampant in your body.  You really should think about talking to your doctor about this.  Your doctor might recommend some medicine do help you.  From what I understand if you are depressed now, then you are more likely to have post-partum depression.  It doesn't mean that will happen to you, but you are just a higher risk for it.<br>  <br>  I have been depressed most of my pregnancy.  I didn't want to tell anyone, I guess I was ashamed.  But my husband talked to my doctor and now I am on Zoloft.  I am starting to feel better.  And my doctor thinks I should stay on the medicine until at least 6 weeks after the birth (perhaps a little longer).  But she says it is rather normal to feel depressed and disconnected. <br>  <br>  Take care.  You are not alone.  But do talk to your doctor.  It might really help.|`|3505983107c631451310c5009361ae76aa	hey im 24 weeks too. i be 22 having my baby. really know how your feeling esp in the last week. dont get me wrong im so glad that im having my baby and cant wait till june to have it but there has been alot going on lately and its making me feel so so down. tried to not let all this get to me cos i know some people say there is a bigger chance of postnatal depression after the baby is born and really dont want that happening. but i just feel so crap and have alot of stuff going on with the babys dad lately and dont know where thats going. so that isnt helping esp when i was already feeling down. hopefully this isnt something thats going to last and we'll get over it. :) hope you start feeling better soon.<br>  ever want to talk about it and just let things out gimme a email :)  babyduejune@yahoo.ie|`|4e0pOmt7aa	you are probably overwhelmed that this is happinging and once the baby is born you will feel totally happier|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Yes you have depression. You need to talk to your OB. Medicine is suppose to be able to help. You do need to tell your doctor though cause, it can get worse after the baby is born. That is called post partum ( however you spell it ) depression. Being you have depression now I wouldn't be surprised if you get it. So your doctor needs to be monitoring your mood. There is one depression medicine that is safe to take when you are pregnant. Maybe that can help you. I know you probably feel crazy talking to your doctor about this but, trust me they hear it all the time. So don't wait to go hopefully they can help. I know they can help after the baby is born if you need it. Make sure to keep your doctor updated.<br>  <br>  Love,<br>  MIchelle
FLEXqVoiaa	No stay here lol. I think eventually most of the moms who frequent the newborn/baby section are all going to be the mothers of toddlers lol. <br>  <br>  I've tried the toddler section, it's kind of boring. If you're looking for answers from expierenced parents of toddlers, try using the general "parenting" section.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I tried the toddler section, and for some reason I always manage to come back here. I asked like one question there one time, and almost all of the answers were rude, I guess there are some nice people there, but who knows? So I just tend to hang around here. If I have any other questions about my son that I don't think pertain to the N&B section then I just go to the parenting section, next to N&B that's my favorite. But I tend to ask everything here, even if it doesn't have to do with my son, the people are just so friendly, so maybe one day when all of our kids are a little older we can make the big move together ha ha!|`|1SGl03Zlaa	My daughter is 18 months and I still haven't switched over to the toddler section yet.  There seem to be more people in newborn and baby.  I've seen lots of people asking about potty training and other toddler questions in newborn and baby so I don't see any reason to switch over.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	sure you can:)) my daughter is 15 months and walking but i still linger the newborn and baby boards haha maybe i have issues with letting go of the fact my baby is now a big girl lol! but be where ever you want to be i just float around and see if i can help anyone!|`|CE3bmj65aa	I don't think the toddler section is as 'lively' as NB section.  I would say it depends on what you are asking or what you feel like answering.  But we won't kick you out of NB yet =)|`|vJEatJFPaa	Go back and forth to both sections! You've got the best of both worlds!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	if you want to consider her a toddler, go ahead.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Awww heck just do both sections :)|`|65RZ441Zaa	you should just try what ever fits and makes your baby comfy. she'll need extra room when she started walking!!!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Oh, do a little of both, see what you like more.  I have checked out the toddler section as well for my 13 month old, but I still prefer the newborn and baby.  I am torn as well.  The newborn and baby section just seems to relate to my son better, and I am familar with people in this section and know more about newborns and babys at this point then I do toddlers.  The newborn and baby section is also more happening, there seems to be more people in this section.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol, you're in limbo!<br>  <br>  Why not dabble in both areas? The best of both worlds. :)|`|zwctZ812aa	You can stay if you wanna :-) lol  There never seems to be much going on in the toddler section, but you could do a little of both! You still remember having a newborn, so you can still be helpful here!Or you could go liven up the toddler section so when we all transfer over it's not so boring! lol|`|BypjotRpaa	Logan is 1 and is walking.. i choose to stay here, but i do venture over in the toddlers and the parenting section...it's kinda boring of in the toddler section!|`|UghJ0XROaa	I don't think i will move over to the toddler section until more people i recognize from here move over there. Stay as long as you like!|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	No!! Don't leave us....  :-)<br>  <br>  I don't think I'll ever leave N&B even though Elyse is nearly toddling...
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	The economy... I hope there are more jobs, and better jobs...and I'd love to see universal health care in the USA so everyone has the same plan and gets the same care. I'd love to see those with college degrees actually getting to use them and getting paid much more than those without them. I'd like to know that our earth is healing and doing better and I'd love to see people be kinder and more accepting of different beliefs.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	A lot of the problems we have today are the same that the generations before us had.  The economy will of course get better, it always has its up and downs so I am not too worried about that.  A part of me wishes things could go back to the way they were years ago when kids were simply allowed to be kids and not forced to grow up so fast.  <br>  <br>  The one thing I hope will become a thing of the past is not allowing gay marriage.  It is discrimination by our government and if my children happen to be gay, I would hope that they would allowed to marry the person they love.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	I hope the economy improves. I never want my daughter to struggle like her dad and I had to.<br>  I hope healthcare is available to all citizens, not just the rich healthy ones.<br>  I hope the enviroment is in much better shape, the air and water are cleaner, and being green is the way of life, not just a trend.|`|prqrQcd1aa	There are so many things to write here that i don't have time to write it all!|`|jt53RiARaa	I really hope people will look at each other as individuals and not labels. I took a black friend to a white friend's party and didn't think anything of it until I realized they both had preconceptions about each other and didn't bother trying to know each other before forming opinions already. It was very disappointing.|`|AA10236694	I hope that People will soon see the "ABILITY" In "DISABILITY"<br>  also that our children will soon not have to keep Facing the dangers of gang violence|`|Heyz3xp9aa	i hope that more opportunities arise for minorities, and a better government and economy.... too many to list|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I agree with the first two, the economy.|`|AA11210211	Definitely the economy,these days the american dollar isn't worth anything and better education which would lead to a better job.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I hope all the xtians are raptured and leave their keys in their cars
KAj7GfeDaa	Leah- I'm thinking about naming my baby girl that too!|`|TGUoZF63aa	They're both nice! I don't like Amelia if she is not going by a nickname, though - it gets to sound nasally after saying it too much. However, it is beautiful. You could always call her Lia if you really cant decide between the two. The nicknames Amey and Mia are adorable, too! I love the name Leah as well. I have a friend named Leah and we call her Le-Le but Leah is beautiful by itself!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HjYP8YSNaa	Both Amelia and Leah are cute...But i liked Amelia more...|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	i know sisters by these names, lol, anyway i like leah|`|AA10333002	Amelia, it's a little more elegant and feminine.|`|E5Ya66Ibaa	I think Leah is way better for a first name, it is young and it will sound good when shes older|`|h8mWBh34aa	Amelia|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I love both, but I like Amelia more.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Leah|`|hyG0c5Nnaa	Leah|`|RjpGomsyaa	Amelia is much nicer than Leah|`|bUcWxQqpaa	Kacio & Kalia<br>  kay-see-oh / kah-lee-ah|`|vGxipYJnaa	Tough choice! I love both of them. Amelia does have the advantage of possible nicknames like Mia and Amy (and even Lia, if she likes) - so I'll go with Amelia.<br>  <br>  Amalia, which is very similar but quite old-fashioned, was on our list.|`|yNxYYHszaa	Amelia with Mia as a nickname!|`|fZGcufB7aa	I love the name Leah that name is awesome!|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Leah!|`|S3vYMNzFaa	Uhm.  Hmmm<br>  <br>  I will have to say Leah.<br>  But, I love Amelia.  <br>  But, Leah is a bit of a longer-lasting thing, for me, anyway.  More consistently on my radar.<br>  <br>  Leah.|`|DJE9Df6Vaa	Amelia! It's soo pretty. Actually my sister is planning<br>  on naming her future child Amelia/or/Amilia and is<br>  going to call her Milly. So cute!|`|CxRJwJsraa	Amelia.<br>  <br>  Leah is sweet, but Amelia just has more options.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	That's a tough choice. I would have to say Leah though, less popular than Amelia. Both are still very pretty though :)|`|VGoCh2C9aa	Leah. if i have a girl thats the name i want.|`|FoBLX9ceaa	i like amelia, plus leah could always be a nickname for her :)|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Leah for me.|`|igMh0iL3aa	Leah
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	huh? you make my head hurt. try dating guys who dont know each other|`|FGjanFY1aa	You had sex w/ all three guys? & all three are friends? & didn't use a condom w/ two? No comment.|`|sFSavtL4aa	I don't want to sound out of line, but if you choose not to keep the baby. I have a beautiful home and could raise him/her as my own child. And you could keep in contact if you would like. Pleasse feel free to contact me, and we can talk.
Ldvi6UPOaa	Yes you can. You can BD until you stop seeing the EWCM. Use OPKs and chart your basal body temp, this is really accurate.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!!!!|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	yes it can wait until night until you can see the ewcm any more. best of luck.
sy0hiGspaa	I love Kerensa, it is gorgeous.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	I prefer Kerensa, simply because to me Rosaline sounds like a brand name for a hand cream or something (rosewater + Vaseline is what is possibly in my subconscious to explain this).|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Definitely Rosaline although I think that most people (at least I did) will pronounce it {ROH-zuh-line}|`|MdSU0s8Saa	rosaline|`|ObKqyZ7haa	rosaline|`|UbCzA2JVaa	Kerensa is actually really cute! It is really unique and it would age well. Rosaline is alright, but I don't think it sounds that great on a little girl.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|47M20WOUaa	I like Rosaline {ROH-zuh-leen}|`|61NKzPzMaa	Rosaline.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	Rosaline|`|jUlsH8Myaa	Rosaline|`|kTu7UtS1aa	Rosaline|`|5CiAFdbsaa	rosaline|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't care for either but Rosaline is MUCH better! I love Rose or even Rosie as the nickname!!|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Rosaline
wTYh7DiSaa	Arggghhhh.. my little princess does not want to come out either! I'm 38 weeks and 3 days, we've been expecting her about a week or so ago. Every birth I had were preterm so, we thought she was either coming just shy of "term" or at 37 weeks. Well, now I am 38 weeks and still nothing! I have painful contractions, the kind that runs to my back and even rectal pressure but, it's only once every hour! It is so freaking frustrating. My last appointment I was told I was only 2.5 cm and 60% effaced as opposed to my 2nd to the last appointment which said I was 2 cm dilated and 50%. She only did a bit in a week! Sigh. I really don't want to be induced either. With my last appointment the midwife actually said,ok we will see you next week that's if you'll make it. Ha! Of course I'll make it, she is comfy and has no desire to come out! Don't get me wrong, I am ecstatic that she is finally full term and that we've gotten this far :) But, I have never been this far along in a pregnancy and I am absolutely in pain, not to mention my husband irritates me with asking me if we need to go to the hospital each time I groan cause of contractions.<br>  <br>  Oh and by the way, I've tried sex to induce this labor and nada. While my previous pregnancies, I only have to sneeze and labor here we come!<br>  <br>  See, now I just ranted! lol|`|J6LKqBqMaa	Sounds like your baby and body are getting ready! The contractions or as i call rushes are getting the baby ready.Try not to be irritated every rush big or small they ALL get you closer to your baby.|`|bEn6hiamaa	Hey Hun,<br>  I'm not 39 weeks, nor close to it! haha, but just saying congrats.<br>  I am sure little Gabriel will be here soon enough =)|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I'm due today! And I've been having all the signs of labor but it never progresses into anything, it's so frustrating lol. I can't wait to see her!!|`|rUyYEc9Vaa	aw congratulations on your little girl i wish you the best of luck heres a tip did u know sex can induce labor make it happen faster|`|ioZeveazaa	I am due on Saturday by cesarean because my girl is breech. She is healthy but unfortunately doesn't want to flip. I am super excited but nervous. Good luck to you!|`|QSodlfMraa	i am 24 weeks and cant wait so it not just those who are in their 30 plus weeks who want their baby.<br>  <br>  congrats.
V8JoRHnnaa	i would say do it evry other day through out month :)<br>  Baby Dust hun
UDENYO4raa	Not really.. People are gonna make their own decisions, no matter how ignorant and inconsiderate they are.|`|fe37gfRvaa	tell her she's disgusting.|`|FKf67HXaaa	There isn't really anything you can do, and honestly its none of your business. I know a lot of people who smoke weed during pregnancies and nothing goes wrong. And if you look it up on the internet you will see that nobody has ever found a real reason not to smoke weed while pregnant. There has never been a birth defect after birth that points to weed. Weed is a plant, and god put it here, there is nothing wrong with it. I wouldn't recommend smoking a lot every day but a little bit is fine.|`|DutTBV3caa	i would call childrens services. i know you dont want this women losing her kids, but if thats the only way to guarantee their safety and health, then thats what needs to be done. and hopefully she'll be able to get clean so she can keep them or get them back if they are taken. trust me, their lives will be better without weed in their lives.|`|AA11981363	Google marihuana smoking and pg and print some info and hand it over (if you are really that close to her, etc)<br>  <br>  some women are idiots! :x|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Your neighbor is an idiot. If I were you, I would have called Children's Services... but that's just me.  If she's putting her baby's life in danger like that, she doesn't deserve children.|`|rjVALevtaa	The only thing you could really do is call child services.|`|WL1cX9rTaa	nothing really. you could ask if she wants to stop and give her resoucres to stop and tell her its bad.. but its all up to her if she wants to stop. any getting the police involved might have a negative impact because those her kids would problably end up in foster care unless anotherfamily member was willing to take them in.. see if her sister will talk to her and ask her to stop.. an intervention maybe im not sure..|`|C1blHL9vaa	It would really depend how far you want to take it honestly. You can report her to the authorities but just be aware if it turns out to be true then they may take her children away. You can try talking to her and letting her know that her sister has told you this information.|`|J38v75bvaa	well you can call the cops and get her place raided because it is illegal. that will be alot of fun for her kids to see. or you can mind your own business. <br>  <br>  my mom smoked weed when she was preg with me, the doct told her since its a natural herb that its fine.|`|XKhNw221aa	you shouldn't get involved. if you do nothing good can come from it. And don't call the cops, or social services. if it didn't hurt the previous two or me, then there isn't a problem.|`|WsUSAgLmaa	Its really her business but at the same time she is puttin the lifes of her children in jeopardy. The sister must of felt like she could confide in you so i wouldnt say anything!!|`|OPTDFRuzaa	if i were you i would stay out of it as you will end up fighting with neighbours you need to live beside yes its wrong and disgusting but some people no matter how many times they are told wont listen anyway.|`|QbJ04Zqiaa	Mind your own business.|`|BO28Mn8haa	call protective services.|`|XSdpGsT6aa	I think you should print this article out, and put it in her mailbox A.S.A.P.!!! also print out a picture of a fetus-and then see what she does. I wonder if her other children have asthma. Boy is your neighbor stupid!! I wonder if her mom did that to her while she was in her stomach, what would she feel?|`|POY6yjBBaa	weed is probably safer for the child than regular tobacco because it is additive free but u can call the cops they can sort it out|`|5nAnWp3daa	mind your biz or step up and call child welfare|`|D0M2AXTGaa	I would call Children's Protection Services if I were you, not only is she harming the unborn baby, but the other two children as well, she obviously doesn't care about their health or well being. Look it up online in the state you live in and call them. This women doesn't deserve those children. Good luck!
cAtWxJG1aa	the homeschooled kids i know are grade levels above their public-schooled peers.<br>  <br>  i believe that there should be some requirements put on homeschooling to make sure that kids who are being schooled at home are actually getting an adequate education (rather than say roaming the streets and playing video games).  in most states, i think those kinds of requirements already exist.  i'm all in favor of people's having the choice to be homeschooled with that caveat.<br>  <br>  (*actually, tales, it varies by state.  in my state, parents have to submit a curriculum plan but do not have to do any testing or submit actual work to show what they've covered or what the child has learned.)|`|SnQvsOPwaa	The government wants to dictate how people should raise their kids. Unfortunately they have to because of the amount of parents that don't. I used to get so angry at the school wanting medical info or other things that I viewed as crossing the lines. But somebody has to be able to find the kids that are at risk and I can't think of another way.|`|AkFag8tNaa	How you choose to educate your child should be a right, provided that you are able to show progression and are staying on task w/current curriculum (I'm not educated on "unschooling" but know that it's a much different environment than homeschooling). Schools in the UK are having much bigger issues than losing kids to homeschooling so I wonder why they are focused on that? Scotland has the worst schools in the United Kingdom (drop out rates are high)|`|a8IRxC4raa	We're in the USA, where homechooled kids score higher than kids in brick and mortar schools.  That begs the question, as far as I am concerned, however, because the brick and mortar schools teach a specific curriculum designed around the test, and the kids are taught to the test.<br>  <br>  We removed our child from school because of an abusive teacher and a murderous classmate. So, yes, I have a right to chose my child's education.  Not only right, but a responsibility.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|M2yERqNSaa	maybe in the UK the home schooled kids don't test as well but in the USA home school kids test well above publicly educated students<br>  <br>  my friends kids go to a public school and the teachers are so worried about being politically correct and trying to handle the problem children that there isn't much teaching going on<br>  <br>  my kids are home school, and they are doing advanced work and test well above publicly educated children|`|PTdy6TWRaa	I think in areas where teacher's unions are too strong and influential on politics we'll see nonsense arguments like this put forth as efforts to force everyone into the public school system.<br>  <br>  I really think keeping available options such as home school or school choice is good for everyone in the long run including the public schools. If there is no choice, just a monopolistic system, then complacency and mediocrity will set in.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	If they believe that abuse only happens to homeschoolers, they're obviously idiots.<br>  <br>  I homeschool my kids... Anyone is welcome to check in on us, at any time. My kids are in an actual homeschool program, that keeps track of their transcripts, and will give them a graduation... We pay (just for our oldest two, for now), almost $2,000 a year on this homeschooling education... They are required---by the school---to make a minimum of 80% on all tests, or they have to re-do them. (Our youngest two aren't schoolage, yet.)<br>  <br>  My kids are also involved in sports, and are truly great kids... Homeschooling is a good choice for us. :)|`|LwbwMFX9aa	modern mum, im sorry but NO, alot of teachers who have degrees are awful teachers<br>  <br>  I so wish I could homeschool mine but ALL I know is that by the time my daughter is in the first grade, My son shouldnt need any resource during the day ( he has autism ) once I know he doesnt need resource during the day, I will get a job just to pay for private school.<br>  <br>  THey WILL NOT stay in public school<br>  <br>  <br>  des, they do, its called testing. the parents have to prove the kids are doing the work, at least they do in the usa, my nephew has been homeschooled all his life, he is a great kid and smarter than most adults I know|`|b8f0CfSsaa	I think unless you have a degree and can prove you have the aptitude to educate your child on all key subject areas (i.e could pass a basic GCSE in maths, english AND science) then you should not home school your child as your skills may not be of great benefit to them.<br>  <br>  It is down to the parent and what they feel would benefit their child best. Some children are too nervous to attend school, have been badly bullied, have a dissability and so would benefit from home schooling. On the other hand you can't deny that the social interaction you get from school can't be beat.<br>  <br>  I am very on the fence on this one, but personally I will be sending my daughter to a school as I don't possess the necessary skills to teach her maths or science.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It is interesting to hear how our government picked them statistics (classic labour pick and choose tactics), I am sure those in the UK that are genuine home school children and not truants perform no worse than the US.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I did not say all teachers (or individuals for that matter) that have degrees are great teachers, I said that there must be a minimum standard for home schooling your child and I believe going through higher education is a good indication of being able to educate another person, there is no other suitable test. If you could only reach A-Level standard then how would you be able to educate someone.Way to take a sentence out of context....
B8v9hAfvaa	i think this is a wonderful deal. take it!<br>  make sure the visits are supervised by someone you trust.... never know!|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Talk to a lawyer to answer your questions and concerns. It sounds like some rights are being questioned and you can find out who has the rights here, and who does not. Usually an attorney will give you a free consultation or even a free over the phone consultation.|`|ybexjS2Paa	In my opinion the father is an a**. It takes two to conceive a baby so two should take care of it financially. It makes me angry when a guy thinks you should play by his rules or else..|`|frpCK0utaa	your questions never make any sense, and show your complete lack of knowledge of the legal system in this country.|`|d5b50df4239d050a07a008ef4c3efc3caa	First of all if he is choosing to leave the country, the court probably wont make you let him take the baby anywhere.  And they will make him pay child support.  I don't see why your so upset.  You need to have a court put everything in writing so you have something to fall back on in case he does something!|`|cYRZpGkqaa	nope|`|AA11206135	People this is a TROLL..

Sometimes you have to be the "bad guy" in parenting and just take the earrings out and throw them out.  Sorry that happened, good luck.|`|zrknbZNGaa	Grow a backbone and take the damned earrings out of her ears. So what if she gets upset? Learn to be a parent and take control of your daughter.|`|MCiSrm2Vaa	i don't believe ur 6 yr old went to get ears pierced on her own...should not let them go out alone. and just get those things out of her ears now...because if u don't she will keep doibg things like these without ur permission|`|nfzQkvqraa	Seriously?  You really need to get yourself some new material.|`|frpCK0utaa	At least the questions are getting shorter...|`|atmDaT61aa	You need to discuss how you guys are going to parent because having disagreements on important things like this isn't going to be good your child is just going to stop listening to one of you and lose respect for you too.
fPFXJr3eaa	Yes because I am NOT a birthmother.  I am a mother the same as any other mother regardless of how anyone else sees it.  Nature dictated that, not man and a flimsy piece of paper cannot take away 34 weeks of nurturing, love and care I had for MY child.... even if some stupid man made the wrong decision for her.<br>  <br>  So yes, it offends me but thankfully it is only an American thing and I can celebrate Mothers Day on Mothers Day!|`|MLQS5Vkdaa	puke.  this is another way of separating the real mother (yes, the real mom is the one who god intended to give birth) from her child.  <br>  <br>  this is another way of making the real mom less than the artificial mom.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Great now I can celebrate two different days...since I gave birth to my older kids then I should have every right to celebrate Birth Mother's Day Right!  Birth and Mother's day...<br>  <br>  <br>  Then I will celebrate Mother's Day which I can celebrate for the Mothering I do day in and day out--That's the day I want Breakfast in Bed and a long hot beauty bath... ummmm a mother's work is never finished but on Mother's Day even Daddy gets in on the fun and takes everyone out for dinner...<br>  <br>  And What the Heck if I get to celebrate the day because I gave birth and because I am the Mother of the House, why not toss in Adoptive Mother's Day too! <br>  <br>  I guess, I don't get to celebrate Step-Mother's Day but, that's okay with me--why should I be so greedy with all the other special Mom Day's I get to celebrate...|`|uhZzEzu0aa	While i'm not offended with birth mother day i see no reason to celebrate it. As thoughtful as the jester was it's only that a jester. To me that day symbolizes what i have lost and that's being a family to my daugther in the full mommy sense. Don't get me wrong i'm glad she has a loving family I wouldn't change anything but i still live with the pain that i'm here and she's not. I think birth mother should talk to each other more than once a year its like i'm going to cry and share my story with other mothers and be ok until the next birth mothers day. Doesn't work like that. So me and my mom go out to a nice dinner and just talk give each other present and talk about aria and that makes me feel better.  For some people this day helps them but i'm not one of those people.|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Birthmother's Day isn't celebrated in the UK thankfully but if it was I would completely ignore the day as I find it very offensive.  It's bad enough that natural mothers are labelled birth mothers without further rubbing our noses in it.  I just see it as further stigmatizing us as not quite mothers/not good enough mothers.  On the other hand where does it stop?  Do we start having Step Mother's Day. Adoptive Mother's Day, Foster Mother's Day?  We are all mother's in our own right so should be recognosed as this.<br>  <br>  I usually refer to my son's adoptive mother as his mother as she is exactly that and only add adoptive when I need to clarify.  She and her husband refer to me as his mother as well and add natural (their choice) when they need to clarify as we respect each other's roles as mothers.  One day is good enough for all of us mothers.|`|AA11210211	I have never seen the Birth mothers day on any calenders,so this is new to me???|`|vGxipYJnaa	It doesn't offend me but I think it's unnecessary. Some birth mothers don't consider themselves mothers, and some do. I think the ones that do can celebrate regular mother's day.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Maybe it  should be called "Natural" Mothers day...and for the rest of the parents "Substitute" mothers day,  "IVF" mothers day or "Egg/Sperm buyer mothers day" and you can't leave out the "Womb renters" mothers day.<br>  <br>  Some women will get to celebrate 2 or 3 mothers days or get their uniquely own special day...."Egg/Sperm buyer ,womb renter, substitute" mothers days.<br>  <br>  I wonder how well that would go over.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "shouldn't there be an Adoptive Mother's Day too?"<br>  <br>  They made up one repulsive one called "gotcha day".....but of course thats pushing the adoption onto the childs shoulders.|`|hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Savanna,<br>  <br>  I dislike "Birthmother's Day" too. It is silly to have a separate day, however misguidedly well intended. <br>  I don't have a separate day for being a step-mom. <br>  <br>  Although, if I work this right that's THREE mother's days for me. <br>  Hmmmm. Maybe I can get a day for being "mother" to my furbabies too...|`|7JEojMgQaa	I thought it was offensive when I first heard about it. But I think it's a backhanded step in the right direction. It is at the very least recognizing surrendering mothers. Which was unheard of 30 years ago. It might be backward, awkward, slightly disrespectful, but it is still recognition. A mother is a mother no matter what form she takes and THAT needs to be recognized.|`|3X4i5Whvaa	It is offensive. It outright says that women whose children were adopted from them are not mothers.<br>  <br>  The western world has gone insane. The adoption industry is defining a "mother" as the one who buys the child. She doesn't even have to raise it. She can place the child in daycare, or she can hire a nanny.<br>  <br>  "Birthmother's Day" was invented by a woman who surrendered a child herself. She should know better.  Birthmothers Day is like "Surrender Your CHild Day"..<br>  <br>  Who would want to celebrate a day like that..what a terrible , sad,day.<br>  <br>  Mothers Day should honor mothers.Separating mothers and children doesn't honor them, and creating 'days' that honor separation doesn't help.<br>  <br>  I am a mother who was forced to surrender my child, so I am not dishonoring mothers who were forced to surrender nor am I disrespecting those mothers who believe they have made a decision for the best.<br>  <br>  <br>  Surrender was not the best for my child, nor for me.|`|cd98c09cc34c3c84ad4502d636e2d2beaa	I find it to be very offensive.  Just another way for baby brokers and adoptive parents to tell us that we're not mothers and hence not deserving to be honored on Mothers Day.  <br>  <br>  Adoption agencies love this day and sponsor picnics on it for all their little brainwashed victims. One more way of keeping them in their place ("Oh I did such a wonderful loving deed!  Now back to crying my eyes out every time they send me a photo.")|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	I have never heard of it before right now, but I don't find it offensive, a little ridiculous yes. A mother is a mother, regardless whether adoptive or biological, it doesn't matter. There is no need to have a birthmother's day.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	First mother. Adoptive mother. Foster mother. Step mother.<br>  <br>  A mother is a mother is a mother.<br>  <br>  As far as I'm concerned, Mother's Day is all-inclusive.|`|wsRCZ1Mtaa	It offends my son's mother- that's good enough for me.<br>  <br>  We joke that I get mother's day, and she gets labor day.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, because of family politics, we seldom get to spend Mother's day with her.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	No need for a separate day, all mothers should be honored on the same day!|`|frpCK0utaa	What in the world? stomp on their emotions a little harder government..ugh.<br>  <br>  A mother is a mother.|`|AA11100991	I think you're right. I am a Birthmother too, and it took a tremendous amount of love and courage to decide that I wanted my little girl, (now in her twenties) to have a family around her and all the things I could dream of for her, rather than keeping her no matter what the price. I am just as much a mother for her as I was for my other children. Until someone has made the sacrifice of letting such a precious gift go into the arms of another, he or she cannot judge and Mother's Day should be for all mothers. It's just plain ridiculous to categorize what a Mother is.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	As an adoptee, it offends me. I send BOTH my Mothers a card on Mother's Day.   <br>  Im more offended that November is "National Adoption Month". Yay.... a whole month of celebrating the fact I lost an entire family. That makes me puke. A lot. But not as much as "Gotcha Day", lol. <br>   <br>  ***ETA**** Happymom wrote,  <br>  "National Adoption Month was supposed to only be about the children in the US Foster Care system and is one of the few ways we have to bring attention to the children waiting... It was never supposed to be about celebrating adoption in general...so, sad this has even been hyjacked..."  <br>   <br>  Hijacked by whom? Go cry to your buddies at adoption.com or the NCFA. They luuurrrvvvee to celebrate adoption, no matter what month it is. Especially the adoptions that bring in the big bucks.
AA11785285	The REAL question is not whether or not the furniture is worth it, but rather, why did these two opt to beget a child they cannot afford, and will likely end up on welfare and having the tax payer raise that child?<br>  <br>  In the end, it will cost 2 decades of their lives, either together or apart, and $250,000 of tax payer and their money to raise a child with nothing extra...<br>  <br>  Just a full belly of cheap food, tv, some dope, mj and meth and a cell phone in hs.  No art, no private music lessons, no trips to Italy, no symphony tickets, no RVing, no horse nada...<br>  <br>  People who are "dirt poor" need to pull themselves out of that before they add to it.|`|XXZFf1AYaa	Nice of you to want to buy them stuff, but that is so rude of her, poor or not, to tell you she wants your baby things. She knows that you know obviously she won't pay you for them. They need to get full time jobs and grow up. Even minimum wage for two people would bring home more than they do if they were working any kind of hours. Unless of course, that's the money they bring home in old coffee cups?<br>  <br>  If you want to do it, do it. But I don't blame your husband.|`|1enIWBGnaa	If your sister-in-law doesn't have the brains to get her own 'baby' stuff then do NOT lift a finger to help her.  It's not your fault she's in this situation and she needs to grow up and take on the responsibility herself or just be without.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	I'd do it. For $40 you can't go wrong. And if hubby goes with you you've spent an afternoon together :)|`|T52u1DVXaa	I think it's worth it.  Of course I'm the person who will drive out of town to buy about 40 balls of yarn for $32!|`|DNygQdmVaa	If you think its worth it then go for it.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	sure of course get it! that's a good deal. But isn't anyone throwing her a baby shower?|`|1tmX7xbRaa	if would drive that far .... all that stuff for 40 bucks that's a great deal. guys don't understand that though|`|bwlDJdtdaa	Don't dwell on it too much. If you choose not to take the drive then that's  your choice. If this woman wants these so badly then why can't she get them herself or organize a family member to get them. The only person who can end up looking like the bad guy is your sister in law, this situation her hers she really should not have waited 7 months when the pair are so financially unstable.|`|wnUJlc09aa	I think that you should let your sister in law know that the things are for sale, and leave it up to her to pick them up. If she's having a kid, she need to start learning how to be responsible now. ...but as to your question...that is a fantastic deal!|`|b7cd9c0b4590139a91d5e432b9528df2aa	I think it would be really great of you.<br>  <br>  it's completely worth it, think of how you would feel if someone did that for you!|`|d3jtRA8caa	That is a great idea. $40 is not bad at all. Its worth it to help you'll feel great afterwards.|`|LwbwMFX9aa	question is, why are they having a baby if they cant even buy the basic needs for this baby ?|`|yJ7X3oEdaa	It sounds worth it. I have drove an hour away to buy good deals for my kids!|`|CsLsSkLNaa	That sounds like a GREAT DEAL....do it. She can't complain if you're paying for it.|`|AA12176610	You sound like an awesome sister-in-law....!  I would do the same if I were in your shoes.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I think it is a great deal, but it isn't your responsibility. She's the one who got pregnant,she should be the one shelling out the 40 bucks and half a tank of gas! Both my sister in law's are pregnant or just had a baby, and since I have the only girl, none of my stuff is getting taken. I got my crib at a consignment shop, which it broke down after a year of use but for 10 bucks, hey, can't beat it! It's not your job, even though you don't want to see an innocent child suffer, which I wouldn't either, you can't do it all.|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I think it's great that you want to help out, and really that long of a drive wouldn't take more than a half a tank of gas, depending on what you drive.|`|hKJIDdVqaa	yes, sounds good.  Do unto others as you would expect them to do for you.  How about a baby shower also?|`|njgHAiBiaa	I wouldn't drive all that way and then give your sister your stuff, while you keep the stuff from craigslist.<br>  <br>  You were planning on giving your sister the stuff that is selling for $40, right?<br>  <br>  Could you call your parents, and then they could make the drive out?<br>  <br>  Be careful about the craigslist stuff because people act on deals very quickly - by the time you have decided what to do, the stuff may have been bought by someone else!|`|eu6UQElYaa	I would say it's probably worth it.   $40 bucks for an entire room of furniture is a good deal when a crib alone will usually cost at least $125.   Gas prices aren't $4 now so even with the cost of gas you probably won't come near what it would cost you or her to get a brand new set of baby furniture.   So I'd say it's worth it.   Of course, you aren't married to me so I'm not the one you have to convince ;)|`|flqAr30laa	Its worth it, you know all that stuff is NOT cheap.<br>  <br>  You shuld also try Freecycle.org for free baby items people give away.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Worth it.

IRFbj0G9aa	I feel for you.  Your mother will always bark at you cause she hasn't  comprehended that your relationship is not Mom and little girl who gets ordered around.   Some moms get it immediately.  Others don't.  And yet a bunch fight it.   I wont judge which category your mom falls into but it's surely one of the last two.  Keep in mind your mom is doing what has become second nature to her from being a mother.  She can't help it.  Just like you will, you'll see.   I understood this only recently.  When you become a mother, you have to deal with a host of issues, from how to entertain your youngster, to how to protect it, to how to discipline it and it never stops.  You have to have the answer in milliseconds, and it just becomes routine.  Now years and years go by, and that beautiful baby you have been in charge of or responsible for has now grown up.  And wow, has a child of her own.  What does she do?  How does she stop it, when it is afterall  SECOND NATURE and what was something for her to be proud of, is now BAD.   You have to make the relationship pass to another level, one of two adults -  level playing field.  This happened to me and I had my mother with me my whole pregnancy and months thereafter(in my home, not high risk pregnancy, just wanted to share the experience with me cause I live in a different country from her).   It was a living hell!   And I loved her dearly and still do.   And by your description you remind me of us.  This is what you have to do.  First of all, you are the mother.  Show it, talk is cheap.  Take charge, don't back down and you have to gain confidence in yourself in your new role.  And I don't mean put the lady in her place out of spite, but just show her what the roles are, nicely and confidently.  Ignore snide remarks, she may resort to all kinds of stuff, you show her love and show her who is in charge of your life and your family.  This is accomplished by just doing what you got to do.  Don't look for instruction, don't know what to do?  Look it up in the internet, ask some friends, read a book.I took the head on confrontational approach and cannot say is retrospect it was the best decision I have ever made.  She fought it till the end.   Did I drive home the message, yeah, but it took years of a very cold and akward relationship, and I can't say it didn't hurt, cause we were very close. Meaning don't allow it to get to a knockout confrontation unless things get out of hand and the lady takes it to extremes.  You decide what are those extremes.   And don't even bother trying to explain that you need her to respect you blah blah blah!  Show her, she may not like it at first, she may hold a grudge but you have to win your emancipation that is the best word I can find to describe it.  She just doesn't get it yet.  No matter how much talking you do, and lovely way of explaining it you wont drive it home.  Cause she also has to accept inside her that her baby really has grown up and what now for her?  She's got a whole truckload she is reluctant to address with you cutting the cord.  I really hope you have gotten what I have tried to convey here.  Good luck sweetie!  And of course congrats!|`|0bIntgTTaa	I agree- you DO need to be firm. I am a 1st time grandmother and I love my grandson but I do NOT interfere with the way my daughter and son-in-law raise him. They are good parents.  You need to try to keep talking to your mother and do not give up. You do not want to be one of those people who years down the road-or sooner- tell your child to do something only to have him ask grandma's permission. And the older he gets, the harder it will be to correct this. Maybe you mother just can 't give up the "in charge" feeling and truly believes her way is the only way. Please be firm and keep trying and good lock!|`|PeEIuzP5aa	I think that you are going have to tell her that you are sorry but we need to leave,if she gets in your face and tell you no that you are not leaving tell her that you will call the police. you are going to have to take Control of your little one it is you and your husband that need to stand up to her and say no, you are not a loud to do this.<br>  i had to do the same thing with my parents and had to tell them sorry you are no longer aloud to see your grandchild. <br>  it harts but it will get easier as time goes on. if you still want her to see her grandchild then you need to stand up to her and say you are not aloud to say anything to my child this is my life now no more. and go from their.<br>  Good luck.|`|hq9rM7Eqaa	I did. My newborn granddaughter needed a blood test - she was screaming - I picked her up & held her. <br>  It was all instinct, not malicious like your mom sounds. <br>  My daughter looked at me and said: "Mom! ... I'm the mom" and I realized she was right.  <br>  I still struggle to not tell her what to do all the time.<br>  <br>  You and your mom need to talk.  Maybe a mediator would help. She's got to let go, trust you, trust that she raised you well enough to do this.  <br>  You have to understand that she's been your teacher on all things life related since birth, and give her time to adjust.<br>  <br>  My granddaughter is 4 now, its better, but I still instinctively act the mom part occasionally.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You need to be firm with her and tell her that you are the mother and you will raise your son how you see fit. It is not an "one size fits all" for parenting. Some peoples techniques do not work for others and vice versa. Tell her that if she can't respect the fact that you are the mother then she won't get to see her grandson and emphasize the grandson part of it. Good luck and I hope all goes well!!|`|6PhSENcXaa	I'm Chris's wife and a grandmother 5 times.  I was so thrilled to be a ganny and my daughter and son in law asked me to come into the delivery room when she delivered our first granddaughter!  I had not problem becoming a grandmother what so ever.  Actually once a month Chris and myself take all 5 grandchildren for the weekend so our kids and their spouses can have a break.  We're thrilled, and they didn't ask us we asked them if it would all right if we did this.  <br>  <br>  So exciting!  We raise 8 children ourselves and my mother and mother in law we're also excited to become grandmother's...|`|J3REXSldaa	tell her that you're the mom not her|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	That just stinks. I guess I was really lucky my Mom was so helpful and supportive I don't know what I would have done without her. Do you live with your mother? If not limit (I mean really Limit) the amount of time you and your son spend with her. And when she tries to intervene with you raising your child step up and remind her that you are the Mom and you will accept productive advice but will not tolerate orders being barked at you. If she cannot learn to control her tone with you then she will have less access to your baby and you.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	first of all do you live with your mother?? If so can you move out? if not because of your condition then this is what you need to tell her. Tell her that she is kind of over stepping her role as a G mother and that her advice is appreciated but you want to be able to do for your child the best possible and that you want the experience of being a mother. Just sit down and have a talk with her <br>  When I became a mother at 17 my mom tried to do this to me and I just told her I want to do it by myself and figure it out <br>  I have learning disability as I was in a go-cart accident when I was younger and suffered brain damage as well.|`|rypsRNs0aa	Poor you~ No not all Grandmothers act like this, hopefully very few. I became a Nanny at age 43 and after raising 3 children myself I had very little interest in bringing up an other child or better said, interfering the way my daughter brought her little son up. Yes I did sometimes say, I did this or that, but I always said he's your child and your responsibility, do the best you can, You have to learn by your own mistakes, just like the Grandmothers did, and generations before that.  We can give advice - whether that is followed doesn't matter. Your son is yours and tell your mother never to scream or shout, that you don't want to upset your son. Tell her outright, that you are grateful for some advice, but you will be the one to decide. Ask her if her mother shouted at her, when bringing up her child or children. But don't shout back, tell her in a reasonable tone of voice. Also say, you have to make your own choice, how to bring up your son, then you'll never be able to blame anyone but yourself, if something goes wrong. Hopefully other people can advice you a bit more.  Good luck to you

It's fairly uncommon, but easy to pronounce. It sounds cute, and is nice looking, too.<br>  And I voted on your list :)|`|mtAqANKfaa	Thats so weird, my sisters names are Alaina, and Aaliyah(Aleah).<br>  I prefer Alexa though, i've always liked that name, and probably cause im not as used to it.|`|rdGQMSyjaa	Alaina! I love it. It's on my favorites list and I love Lainey as a nickname too. :)|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Alaina.  My friend has an Elaina and I think she is the cutest little girl I have ever seen.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	they're all really cute!<br>  <br>  i love Alexa, but i don't like Lexi. i would just call her Lex or Lexa.
AA10327148	I worked the night shift (as a nurse) for 13 years, while home-schooling my daughter. Yes, it works. <br>  I would advise joining a home-schooling group, when the time comes. Ours offered a lot of social contact for the children, group support, and accountability.  One group of 4 moms took turns teaching, so that the children were taught by each, in turn, and provided each mom a day off per week. <br>  I wish you and yours the best success!<br>  <br>  Just a note:<a href="http://www.ericdigests.org/2000-3/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ericdigests.org/2000-3/home.h...</a><br>  (Quoted)<br>  Almost 25% of home school students were enrolled one or more grades above their age-level peers in public and private schools.<br>  <br>  Home school student achievement test scores were exceptionally high. The median scores for every subtest at every grade (typically in the 70th to 80th percentile) were well above those of public and Catholic/Private school students.<br>  <br>  On average, home school students in grades 1 to 4 performed one grade level above their age-level public/private school peers on achievement tests.<br>  <br>  Students who had been home schooled their entire academic life had higher scholastic achievement test scores than students who had also attended other educational programs.|`|9AUmp5jWaa	You have a plan...that's the most important part.  You have to try it and see what works for you and what doesn't.  I respect you for not wanting to burden others with your responsibility but honey everyone needs a night out or some time for themselves.  There's nothing wrong with having a babysitter once in a while.  Avoiding public schools...I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of home school.  It works for some but unless you are a retired teacher with background you can't possibly know the curriculum to follow for your child.  They say that 8 out of 10 home schooled children are below the grade level they are supposed to be at.  Just my opinion.  Good Luck.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	personally i would look at all options here. im a single mom , a working one at that and i go to college. my daughter goes to daycare because thats just the way it has to be. what about if your child is sick? the lack of sleep would be unrealastic, that would be tiring for a mom and a working one too doing night shifts...as a nurse too. i really would think about your ptions...there is absolutely no harm in trying this...but have a back up incase it does become too much.....remember hun you are a mother ...noone especailly your sonexpects your to be superwoman:)|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	I think your plan, while certainly well thought will end up with you burnt out.<br>  <br>  Now...as to schooling---you have no idea what your infant is going to need. I was an at home mom with my daughter, and missed the fact that she had special ed needs. She was ten before she was diagnosed---eleven before I could get her the help she needed.<br>  <br>  If your child has any needs that require help. home schooled children have an even LONGER time getting to the services.<br>  <br>  Why don't you allow your child to at least try the public school system? <br>  <br>  A mother needs down time---and running from work home, to home school sounds like a recipe to a breakdown...|`|8d9219ccd2ad58a22a44c4a8dc45cb48aa	i reccomend that you go for it...<br>  sure you can do it....<br>  remember, if you can dream it, you can achieve it!<br>  <br>  you're lucky your mom helps you! make the best of this chance.<br>  <br>  if things become too difficult, simply readjust your methods.<br>  <br>  i am proud of you to desire more education and taking care of your son...<br>  <br>  good luck dear!|`|1KIwM1uOaa	When my oldest was born I was on my own as her dad had gotten killed before she was born.  I worked midnights and was home with my daughter during the day.  it can be done but at the same time you need to find a friend or family member to help as well.  There will be times when the lack of sleep catches up with you.  I had my mom who would watch my daughter for a few hours after work s I could sleep.  You can be a great parent, raise your child and still accept outside help.  Asking fr help in no way makes you a ad parnt it shows you love your child and want to do what i best for them.|`|8hSo4oSeaa	okay i am soz cant really show my opinion on anything but this home schooling.<br>  <br>  I think you should let him go to a normal school so you child interacts with others. My friends sisters don't have any socialising abilities because they havent learnt how to interact with people of thier own age, that would really be my only concern.<br>  <br>  But your choice. I say put him in school nd he wants to then stay home then when he old enough to make that decision go for it, etc if bullying accurs, i went through it and been through the end, made the best of friends that i will know throught my life because i have been school. If i had never of been school i wouldnt know them now, even if i hates school at parts i wish i could go gback for a day with all my friends.|`|DyCd0fCFaa	I think it's great!Go for it!I am also a 21yr old single mother.My daughter is 2yrs old.I had a job last year and was able to take her with.I lost the job due to the poor economy (we sold insurance).I have not gotten a formal job since then.I clean my mom & dad and grand-parents houses to pay the bills.(I live alone w/ my daughter.)I also am planning to home school.I am working on getting back into college as I am becoming a midwife.By the time I am done with school she will be 5-6 and I will trust someone to watch her while I am at a birth I think.lol.She has never been babysat b4-Good luck Great plan and STICK WITH IT--ITS HARD BUT IN THE END ITS WORTH IT!!!!|`|ld2vmypNaa	Oh I love thumbs down...I just say a prayer for the person who left it..they must be sad lonely people.<br>  <br>  <br>  When you become a mom God has given you the strength and endurance of 100 women. Us women can do it all. Unfortunately.<br>  <br>  I was a single Mom, I was blessed with a great child and still at 23 he is a wonderful man.<br>  <br>  Your plan is not extreme and as long as you have help, go for it.<br>  If it ends up being to much. You can say, I tried.<br>  <br>  Good for you to home school. I wouldn't want my kids in California public schools now days.<br>  <br>  God Bless and Good luck!|`|qImMwhUHaa	I would imagine trying to get through school would be more difficult than actually working. Nursing school is very intensive and you have to study A LOT. So if you can make it through nursing school then you can do anything! It will be difficult be if you are determined to do it then you can do it. And who knows, you may meet a guy and get married before the time comes for her to go to school and get to be a stay at home mom.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	On the plus side of being a nurse, you will make GREAT money! No need to stress about the expenses of being a single mom. <br>  <br>  On the negative side, I know a lot of people who couldn't handle the stress and long hours. My MIL is an RN and she never works less than 12-15 hour days, even if she tries to get out early. It's a lot of mental and physical stress and it does drain you to the point were you spend your days off recuperating. I would suggest looking into the different fields of nursing (i.e., maternity ward, hospice care, etc) and see which ones you think will best fit your lifestyle. I am not, in ANY way, trying to discourage you from pursuing your career goal, don't give up! Just know what it takes to become a nurse.<br>  <br>  BTW, My mother home schooled me nearly my entire life. I highly recommend it!|`|ygimTNzoaa	If you're a night person it should be no problem. Working the night shift is easier then working 2nd shift. I worked 10 hour shifts 4 days a week 11pm-7am for 2 1/2 years and it was great, though I didn't have kids, my co-worker did. Working that night shift made it possable for her to take her 2 young kids to school as soon as she got back home from work, and she slept while they were in school. It worked that way for her. But you said you wanted to homeschool your kid, (which I don't blame you.). So I don't know. That was an Idea for a 10 hour shift but our commute was 45 mins to an hour each way, so the time added up.<br>  <br>  The biggest question is if you can handle the night shift, are you a night person? Because a lot of people cant pull it off.<br>  <br>  Oh, my friend also had her mom living with her so the mom could help the kids at night if the ever woke up or got scared/sick or anything. Mom<br>  s are great.
z0XRuVwSaa	yes they are am 23 weeks pregnant and im getin my glow now .. my husband loves to feel the baby kick most nights|`|ECPdAeHQaa	I am pregnant and I do not have the glow let me tell you. I am pale, face is breaking out, and I don't feel like getting ready and looking nice like I used to.|`|90zcKChJaa	Well thank you! The 'glow' is from the extra blood we have while pregnant, and the smile is because of the miracle we are creating. ;)|`|KGppArcfaa	Its not just you...they are beautiful. Pregnant women are special =)<br>  <br>  I miss being pregnant =(|`|Fa5OPBhjaa	idk to tell u the truth|`|90z6GK0iaa	My husband is a real "baby" guy.  He thinks pregnant women are the most beautiful beings on earth.  Our oldest daughter is pregnant, and we keep telling her she is glowing, but she doesn't think so. I do!|`|gibnbbWDaa	I don't personally feel this way, and don't know how to answer this without sounding like a douche.... but you probably like it because you know they got knocked up. Just a guess.|`|ngDjTbTnaa	Some women really do, not me. I looked like an elephant with acne. The glow disappeared after a couple months too lol.|`|iMULlxdgaa	Its aright I guess....I'm 40 weeks and sure my husband likes my pregnant body..its different I guess but really I just want to get out of this whole pregnant thing.
IWBpfOXWaa	Let me describe labor to you like this, "take your bottom lip and pull it over your head!"|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Contractions were painful, I did get an epidural though and that helped a lot. I did feel pain when it was time to push but only if I didn't push. My midwife told me I could rest through a couple contractions but I couldn't stand the pain, even with an epidural. It felt good to push honestly. I pushed for 2.5hrs and it only felt like 10 minutes, it goes really fast.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Quite honestly the pushing part was more like being badly constipated! Yes the contractions did hurt but not as much as I'd been led to believe! I think if you can get your breathing right and concentrate on that over everything else you will have it beaten. You must insist on the childs father being with you too, he must be there!! I had my two boys in the 1970s|`|AA11783671	I had my second baby without any drugs and the pushing felt good.  I would feel a contraction coming, and start pushing, and when it was over, it was like I was just watching the TV...feeling nothing really.  The pushing was more of a relief for me.  Best of luck!|`|eV7rtxmuaa	When your actually pushing the baby out it burns. The closest thing I can compare it too is someone holding a lighter under your vagina. Sorry to be blunt but you wanted to know.|`|LDPabWk0aa	is just the contractions!
NCa8bOjSaa	I really don't think so, but I will say this:  out of a circle of 6 close friends, with myself included, 5 of us are pregnant, all due about 1.5 to 2 months apart from the last.  I know another girl who isn't as close a friend, but she is also pregnant now.  My husband's cousin is pregnant, due a week before me, and my boss is pregnant, due a week after me.<br>  <br>  Between March and the beginning of September of this year,there will be 8 babies born to all of us!<br>  <br>  So while I won't say it's hormones, I definitely won't rule out that the feeling of wanting a baby is catchy!|`|iMULlxdgaa	well they say women who spend  alot of time togther (living togther or not) they start to get their periods at the same time.  this has happened with my sister and I, and various friends over the years.  The funny thing is that I have a friend and we have the same due date as each other and I wonder if its becuase we hang out every weekend.  Niether one of us mentioned that we would try for a baby, it was a surprise that we just got pregnant at the same time but I suppose that maybe our ovulation times correlated enough that we got the same due date as well.  And now we're both overdue and still waiting for our babies!!!!!!  Its so sad.  Our induction date is even the same unlesws one of us goes before then...its just one of those VERY WEIRD, probably not ever going to happen again situations.|`|eu6UQElYaa	No.   Doesn't really work that way.   If the sister in law is pregnant (I couldn't really tell from your question) then it's just more a coincidence that they both got pregnant.  The fact is, women will start to get onto the same ovulation schedule with other women they live with sometimes when they've lived together for awhile.  So likely, they just ovulated around the same time and both ended up pregnant.  But one could not have passed pregnancy hormones onto the other making it more likely for her to get pregnant.  That's impossible.|`|H74F8jxuaa	No, it doesn't quite happen like that.  The only way to get pregnant is to have sperm already in the vagina waiting for the egg to drop during ovulation.  You are only fertile for 5-6 days a month and have to have sex at least three times during that time to get pregnant and even if you have sex all the right days, it doesn't mean you will automatically be pregnant.  You have a 20% chance of getting pregnant each month, even if you do everything right.  Hope this helps!|`|c9a66880006bf09aa7e0d1bc1e34ae55aa	okay i know most ppl wud say it sounds dumb but ur question is very important one because now that i think abt it.. i have seen many examples of this myself... <br>  my best friend was trying for 4 years and got pregnant when her sister in law got pregnant and they lived in the same house..<br>  my brother in law's cousin's wife was trying for years and got pregnant when cousin's younger brother got married and his wife got pregnant.. lived in the same house<br>  my best friend's aunt was trying for 5 years and got pregnant at the same time as her sister in law who lived in the same house and was a newly wed<br>  so it does make some sense.. though i dont know how..:)|`|wkd5CMNaaa	No, not even a small chance.

Good choice.|`|OLl5Zc6baa	yes my brother no that girl from scrubs her name is elyot|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Nope, I dont know any females named Elliot, I do know a little girl named Noah though.

However, my ex was thinking about naming his little girl Niamya (Nehemiah from the Bible) or some spelling variation of it. I don't think there is a problem naming a female a 'boy' name. Guys do it all the time. I like Ryan for a little girl too...even though the meaning is "Little Prince".|`|TGUoZF63aa	yes i do! there's a little girl at a dance studio i got to named Elliot and her sister's name is Emersyn. They go by Ellie and Emmy though :)<br>  <br>  and just like everyone else, yes, there is one on Scrubs =]|`|ZUfcM1Ghaa	i actually have never known of any female with that name, but it's really nice and it's not one of those names that belongs to a certain gender, don't worry about it!|`|sFAxthrKaa	My friend's daughter is Elliot Maya, and she is so adorable. You don't hear it much, but her big brother is Elijah Michael and they wanted a name to match.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	I have only known boys with that name.<br>  the meaning of Elliot is 'My god is the lord'. Origin:<br>   Hebrew.<br>   <br>  Hope that helps, take care, :)|`|ujIPFX9Qaa	personally, no I don't, But I think it's unique to take a name that is generally male and make it female.  i like it!|`|BGqhn5nIaa	yeah my bestfriend is called elliot and shes a girl , she dosent get picked on infact were like one of the popular girls:D<br>  <br>  xxx|`|CFFxtileaa	Elliot off scrubs is called Elliot<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  <br>  - i think its a LUSH name, good choice!|`|07prVOz9aa	ELLIOT REED FROM SCRUBS...

ROJans2Taa	when I started pumping I never used a bottle warmer, id usually feed right after pumping, id even take my pump with me when going out for awhile, now that im formula feeding I still dont use one, the few occasions I got caught out with a cold milk, I went to tim Horton's and asked for a large cup of hot water and emerged the bottle in it for 2 mins, my son will drink it now if it's room temp, but I usually try not to let it sit for long, I always have some ready made in my diaper bag so that it's fresh milk if I need it. and yes my boobs did indeed get sore and engorged if I went past my usual pumping time, as they did when I was breastfeeding, it's a hard choice to make, best luck|`|XRdCutgaaa	well if you breast feed you dont need a bunch of fancy special equipment, your milk is always with you, the right temp and ready to go! no bottles no mess.  sure its hard in the first month or two, but after that its a breeze! and your giving your baby the best nutrition available, dont let the formula companys fool you, formula isnt even close to breastmilk!  plus youll loose your baby weight in no time! <br>  good luck!|`|QmTCMZtgaa	I don't understand the need for bottle warmers -- I bought one and 7 months later I've never used it.  If a baby is breastfed, breastmilk is room temperature at best.  If baby is then switched to formula, just use room temperature water (I use filtered water).  Maybe I'm being too simplistic, but this has worked for me.<br>  <br>  Also, if you are out shopping and you bring formula with you, just bring the bottles with water and mix the formula as you need it since it won't keep for more then an hour anyway.<br>  <br>  You can find a lot of breastmilk storage info on the Medela website (it's also included with their pumps).  If you choose to pump, you should do so as often as your baby eats in order to maintain your supply and avoid engorgement.  Engorgement won't be such an issue after you've established your supply (I think at about 6 weeks).  Your body will know how much to produce based on demand.<br>  <br>  I hope this is helpful.|`|deIzFnV8aa	1 and 2 - You shouldn't keep a bottle warm for a long period of time, because of bacteria. You should refrigerate it and warm right before using. This applies to both breast milk and formula.<br>  <br>  Some babies are pickier than others about warm milk. Most babies will be content with milk/formula at room temperature.  Breast milk can stay at room temperature for up to 8 hours; for formula guidelines you need to check the instructions on the specific package you are using.<br>  <br>   I often give DD her breast milk bottles cool, just letting them stand on the counter for 20 minutes or so before giving them to her. YOu can also warm a bottle under running warm (not hot) water, or in a bowl of warm water. In a pinch you can even warm a bottle for a picky baby between your thighs :P We do not have a bottle warmer, so when I warm a bottle I do it with a bowl of warm water.  Since I only give one bottle a day, this is no problem for me; if you did all bottles, you might want an easier way (like a bottle warmer).<br>  <br>  3. It depends a little on the person and the age of your baby.  At 4 months, DD goes 4 hours between feeding and longer at night, so I can do at least this w/o becoming too full.  Missing one feeding is usually also not a big deal, though I do start to feel full and heavy at that point.  By the time I have missed 2 feedings (like if she sleeps 10 hours at night), it is becoming uncomfortable.  Even so I usually do not leak, or leak only when I get letdown when she nurses the next time. however, some people leak more easily, so it is hard to say what would be the case with you.  You can always wear nursing pads in your bra, though, if it is a problem.<br>  <br>  4. I understand it takes 1-2 weeks on average, though since I BF currently this is not personal experience. Again, I think it varies a bit from person to person, and is often only really bad for the first 3-4 days.<br>  <br>  5. I think it is not essential to have a bottle heater when you are out and about.  Presumably that would be the exception and not the rule. Also, if you were only going to be gone a few hours, it would be easy to take a bottle that you allowed to come to room temperature over that time.  I am not comfortable leaving milk at room temp for 8 hours, even though it is technically ok according to most websites; however, for 2-3 hours I wouldn't mind at all.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|r9epzkJVaa	I bought the powdered formula when I bottled fed my babies, and just filled the bottle up with warm water, then mixed in the formula. Don't ever use the microwave, it will make the formula too hot. If you are pumping your breast milk, it depends on how old the baby is whether you need to warm it up or not. You can just warm up the bottle under warm water, too. I did this, also. I've had 6 children, and never once used a bottle heater. When I was out in public, I just went and filled the bottle up with warm water, then the powdered formula. Makes it easier when traveling away from the home.|`|vue9NOhYaa	1. You don't want to keep milk warm for many hours. Warm milk is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria.  Bottle warmers are intended for short term use, but you don't need one. You can make up a bottle with warm water, or warm it in a bowl of hot water. Or, if baby will drink it cold, that's fine too. If you're out, keep the bottle cold.<br>  <br>  2. Fresh expressed breastmilk will keep at room temp for 8 hours. Once it's been refrigerated or frozen, it should not be kept at room temp or feeding temp for more than an hour or two. Keep it cold until ready to feed, then warm, or feed cold.<br>  <br>  3. Yes, if you are nursing or pumping and go past the time you would normally nurse/pump, you will get engorged and leaky.    (Which is a good reason to just nurse your baby while out, rather than messing with pumped bottles.) <br>  <br>  4. If you don't breastfeed at all, you should dry up in a week or two.|`|AA10097817	Read literature from the La Leche League. Get a lactating coach. If your mom nursed, listen to her.<br>  <br>  If someone gives you one of those bottle heaters, great, otherwise I'd wait to see if you need it.

He has made threats and said things about not liking the fact that Kenzie and his father were together.. Sadly we are not required to keep guns locked up and away from kids in the state of PA, nor are you required to register such guns... sucks yes..stupid, yes..we have to change these laws.<br>  <br>  Now..what makes an 11 year old tick? To the point where he is sooo jealous that he actually kills someone? I think that for the time being the child needs to go to an adolecent psych ward...not the freaking county jail that can't even house him.. Kenzie would stick up and defend him over her own children just to try to make him feel at home, and feel loved, his own mother has not been around for the past 11 years his father has been raising him. They did not seek help because no one thought that he would actually kill her, or her children. They thought he was just jealous and it was a "phase" that he was going through.. Many people out there are guilty of the same thing.. Children being brought together with mixed families are often jealous of the new girlfriend, or other children. <br>  <br>  Kenzie and the boy's father have been only living together for 5 months when all of this happend, and the boy has been saying this stuff for a couple of months, I think they were doing a type of "wait and see" approach with him being jealous.. I will repeat again.. NO ONE thought he would actually do this! <br>  <br>  He IS going to be charged as an adult, no matter how we feel about this, or what we say about this.. In the state of PA, if you are 10 years old and kill somone with premeditation, you ARE charged as an adult.<br>  <br>  He killed not only Kenzie, but also the baby that was inside of her...i say baby because had she have been found right after it had happend, the child would have had the chance to survive... he is being charged with killing this un born child as well. <br>  <br>  I think that there could be a chance that if he gets help that he would not kill again as an adult.. I think he should get say about 25 years in jail.. first in juvie, then send him to a regular jail once he turns 21... it's usually 21 in our state that you can't go to juivie anymore. <br>  <br>  This is what i think...but alas this is not an option in our state either for some strange reason... we NEED to change several of our laws here!<br>  I pray he goes to a psych ward honestly..that is where he should be going!|`|796de2a4227333484ebac3deccc1937eaa	I think it's shocking and so very tragic. It breaks my heart that the woman and baby died but it also pains me that this little 11 year old boy could even comprehend doing such a thing. <br>  <br>  The kicker in this story is the gun the boy used to shoot his father's fiancé, was a gun MADE FOR CHILDREN given to him by his father. The guilt the father must feel is unimaginable. You know he probably blames himself and will always carry that weight on his shoulders. I for one hate the idea of people creating guns that are for children, never mind actually giving them the weapons.<br>  <br>  Obviously this child needs help. Of course he needs to be punished but he needs psychological help as well. He's being held in an adult prison in isolation. The good thing is the prison seems to be doing everything possible to keep him safe from the adult inmates. The entire jail goes on lock down when the boy is allowed out of his cell for showers and time outside. <br>  <br>  No matter how much you feel bad for the boy (and I do) you have to remember that he shot his father's fiancé as she lay sleeping with her unborn baby execution style. He then hid the gun and got on his school bus as if nothing happened. All of that equals out to be premeditation and a severely disturbed child. He obviously can't be out in the regular world as a normal child because the fact is he isn't normal. He needs to be constantly supervised, given mental evaluations and help as well as punishment for the horrible act he committed. However, I very much disagree with the people that think he should be given the death penalty. Killing this child will not make anyone in this situation feel better and it won't make everything right again. Nothing will.<br>  <br>  Brit|`|XOtOMncwaa	At child knows exactly what their doing at the age 11, they might not be able to totally understand the consequences, but they do know not to kill someone. I think he should go to prison, and have lots of counseling, someone like that will be a troubled adult that will probably never be able to function in the real world, so prison is where he needs to be. That's an awful story, but I'm sure he knows that your not supposed to kill someone.|`|jLYTKr33aa	Poor little boy?  LOL!  First of all, he's not all that little.  An 11 - year - old is old enough to understand the seriousness of murder.  And never mind the poor woman and baby who are now dead, right?  <br>  I'd be worried if he didn't go to jail.  He killed a woman and an innocent baby - his own sibling, might I add.  He needs to be locked up.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	completely agree with what kit kat said only she said it better lol. he is a child....severe punishment as in death penalty is absolutely barbaric. that boy yes ok he responded to jealousy in a very bad way but why??? social services and police need to investigate what the heck was happening in that house for an 11 year old to think that shooting his step mom to get rid of his problem was ok.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	He needs to be locked away in a mental health facility so he doesn't kill anyone else. Jealousy is a normal emotion but the way he responded to it is NOT normal.|`|VNAiB4v8aa	He is probably one fo those spoil ed little brats that should have had my husband to warm up his bottom well, before this happened.<br>  <br>  Mom of 4|`|FvYqKZSMaa	He needs prison.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	An awful story... I don't excuse it, but, at 11, he hardly has the mind of an adult... I can't help but wonder what his situation was like... Mom and dad obviously split (or she passed away?), dad gets with this woman who already had kids, and then daddy's got another baby on the way... Lack of attention, I'm betting. He lost his mom, then had to compete with a girlfriend, girlfriend's two kids, and another on the way.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm not excusing it. But, this didn't happen for no reason, in the kids' mind.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	This is an eleven year old child NOT a 35 yr old hardened criminal. I think he needs to be tried as a child. That is what he is. Charging an 11 yr old as an adult undermines our juvenile courts. Why bother with separate courts for minors if we are going to charge prepubescent children in adult court? What was going on that an 11 yr old would shoot this woman? It doesn't make sense. There had to be severe issues in that home. I don't know exactly what punishment he deserves. But I do know he doesn't deserve the death penalty. Anyone barbaric enough to think a child deserves to die in the name of justice is a bit backwards.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	He should be tried as child, if he's not old enough to watch adult programmes and participate in other adult activities then he's not old enough to be tried as an adult.<br>  <br>  If people want children to be treated like children then that goes for everything not just the situations that benefit adults. Why is everyone so much harder on child criminals?|`|fniHoVyaaa	No he is a murderer, he hid his shotgun in a blanket because the first time he tried to carry them down the girlfriends daughter asked him what he was doing. So he went back up and hid it in a blanket can back down and shot her execution style in the back of the head, he is MENTAL! <br>  He had also been threatening to kill her for the past week, but know one decided "hmmm, he shouldn't have guns in his room"?|`|LwbwMFX9aa	prison for life<br>  <br>  that womans 4 yr old daughter went to see her mother and had to hear her mother ask for help as she lay dying<br>  why do you say poor little boy ? hes  a monster, what about the 2 girls she left behind and the baby that died inside of her|`|zjuMrDmGaa	I think the kid has serious mental issues that needed to be addressed well before this happened as he made repeated threats over a few months towards this woman. He needs psychiatric help now as well, not necessarily jail, but he needs to be locked up.|`|uZuIo4rOaa	He knew what he was doing, it was cold hearted and premeditated. <br>  I dintt feel sorry for this boy. He should get locked it jail or the death penalty..|`|t1NmFX3Kaa	" poor little boy ". How about " heartless crazy Basturd "|`|M2yERqNSaa	he needs to be in prison, he hid the gun under a blanket so no one would see it, that means premeditation|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I normally am a strong proponent of the death penalty. But regardless of what he did, he is still a KID. You cannot put a child to death! It's sad that he felt he had to go to such extremes in order to solve his problem, but he is a kid who has normal kid feelings - unfortunately he felt the need to take them to the next level. I won't say it wasn't premeditated, because I think it probably (obviously) was. But he still doesn't think like an adult would. Executing him would set a very dangerous precedent and would be a lose-lose situation for everyone.<br>  <br>  He is being held in jail right now but away from the rest of the prison population. I think he should remain in juvenile custody until he's 18 and then be transferred to a prison facility for an indefinite period of time.|`|MxhNzW7Oaa	POOR LITTLE BOY? WTF are you smoking? He MURDERED 2 innocent people and you feel sorry for him? He KNEW what he was doing was WRONG and murdered her out of jealousy.<br>  <br>  BTW--this happened about 45 minutes from where I live.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Wow people all over the world are talking about this I figured it was just local news. He is in the jail of the county I live in (Lawrence) and the city is only about 10 minutes from here. It's a scary story though just to think what must have been going through that little boys head is scary. He put the gun to her head and shot her it didn't seem like he even thought about what he was doing. I think he needs to go away to what ever they need to do with him juvi or jail either way he needs to be treated like an adult for acting like an adult. I also think the father needs to be charged with something for having a unlocked gun in the house. <br>  <br>  That would be 2 counts of murder, clod blood no less. Hope he rots in jail.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	That "poor little boy" killed 2 people because he was jealous. At 11, you know right from wrong. He needs to go to jail. I don't think he should be in general population, but I think since he was so quick to take lives, his should be taken as well. People will be able to visit him in jail, they will be able to talk to him. The baby and woman he killed will never be heard from again. 11 or not, it shouldn't go unpunished.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	He should get the death penalty.  He's a murderer so if he doesn't get death, then he should be locked away forever.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	ewwie!!! i didnt read this before, but thats sick! i hope he does go to jail he's clearly a menace to society.
DDIBEvUTaa	yes. thanks for posting : )|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Is that when you turn off all your lights for an hour?

d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	Well it will be a tight fit.  My cousin has a Pontiac Vibe (similar in size) and she found quickly that a stoller/travel system takes up the whole rear end.  She returned her stroller and bought the frame stroller that any carseat can snap to it.  Here is a link to the one she got. <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2266236" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <br>  She used this until baby was 1 year and now she has an umbrella stroller because she just has no room in her car for the bulky travel system type of stoller.<br>  <br>  Just an idea.
0U9469GAaa	I'm will be 21 weeks tomorrow and I have gained 11 lbs..most pregnancy books say u should gain between 10 and 15 pounds by this point..I actually put 3 lbs on in like this past week..but its ok if u haven't gained this much yet..they also say that from this point u should gain a pound a week but everybody is different..if you are concerned talk to your doctor otherwise try not to stress to much about it..goodluck let me know if I can help with anything else.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You are supposed to start gaining, on average, 1 pound per week starting at the second trimester.|`|OwK17Qo1aa	I'm almost 24 weeks and in the past month I've lost 5 pounds. Had a check up on Friday and was told I'm losing weight. Then had another check up yesterday and lost a pound from Friday. I'm also dealing with my blood pressure slowly climbing up. But in your 2nd tri your suppose to gain at least  a pound a week.
6DNHxcSsaa	At 25 weeks and with the symptoms you're having your doctor will most likely tell you to immediately go to labor and delivery at your hospital. Go now!|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Call your doctor to be safe. He may want to do a test to make sure you aren't leaking amniotic fluid.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Go to the Dr and get checked. Better a wasted trip than something be really wrong.|`|kT7GVOosaa	the way to test for a leak in amniotic fluid is to sit on the toilet and go to the bathroom. if you finish going pee and the sound has not stopped then it is amniotic fluid. it could just be an increase in your discharge. when you do physical activity your discharge increases.|`|aKiynqA6aa	i would check with the doctor, but it's probably just discharge.  pregnant women tend to have a lot more discharge than normal.|`|RFTzEc5Jaa	check with ur doctor.|`|ic2B0y7zaa	I would go to Labor and Delivery right now!|`|0CA5eNOCaa	Sounds like you're leaking amniotic fluid. There might be a tear in your amniotic sac. U need to go to the hospital pronto! Don't wait until tomorrow when the dr. opens. Go to the E.R. & the pains sound like premature labor.|`|e267738e8cd98da4d834075a0cf69ec4aa	Get to the doc first thing in the morning to get it checked. If it gets any worse overnight, go to your local hospital. Better to be safe than sorry!<br>  Good luck X|`|QJ17P0DOaa	go to dr if you sure its not urine as if its amniotic fluid they will need to keep an eye on your levels. plus always better safe than sorry when your pregnant. good luck.|`|Zvk9qyqqaa	i would call the doctor asap

KSUPtqCaaa	While I know the doctor may be busy, but after years of working with sick kids, I always tend to err on the side of caution...<br>  <br>  Ask the doctor for an earlier visit and ask him to check cardiac and pulmonary function.<br>  <br>  From this end, it is hard to speculate about any possibilities, only that it would be good to rule out the most serious.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, keep a close eye on the baby. Maybe see if you can borrow a breathing monitor or pulse oxymeter from someone.|`|z6IekuwSaa	My baby girl did that off and on for the first month. Not really a reason for it. But the screaming in pain part, her doc said it was prolly her bowels working or gas and that when she got use to the sensation she would stop crying over it|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	Sometimes after the baby cries like that they have kind of a spasmatic breathing pattern when they are just trying to catch their breath from the crying. ( I don't really know how to explain it). If you are very concernedmake an appt. with his pediatrician to talk about it. or if he EVER starts to turn blue, rush him to the emergency room, or call 911 right away.|`|UghJ0XROaa	I know a couple of young kids that have asthma and they both have a almost a chronic cough, until they figured out the problem and started controlling it.<br>  <br>  I think it sounds more like a nightmare, he woke up scared to death and screaming, when he fell back asleep he was having another nightmare and started reacting physically to it. It's just an idea, i know my daughter had night terrors off and on for six months and the scream she used when woke up was horrifying and nothing would relax her for 5-10 minutes.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT-if it was asthma, i would think he would have attacks when he is awake too, my best friend's boy had asthma that started around 6 months. He got a cold and then he just got this horrible deep cough, that lasted for months, then they finally decided to look into more after her pushing them and now he is being treated for asthma|`|3SHfl8myaa	Could the pain be colic?<br>  <br>  They can give you medication for that.|`|68c6B8dRaa	You don't say how old he is, but. Sometimes, some babies do funny things with their breathing -- breathe quickly, hold their breath, whatever -- just because they've just figured out that they can. If you can't even walk, being able to breathe funny is a great novelty; most amusing.<br>  <br>  If it was a one-off I'd suspect he was just playing around and forget about it.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	At night my son will stop breathing for a few seconds and then breathe really fast. He does this off and on all night. I asked his pediatrician about it and he told me that a baby's respiratory system is still developing and they aren't old enough to have developed a normal breathing pattern. So, they often times breathe erratically. I don't know if that's true or not, but it made sense when the doctor said it.

Do you think it's good for the baby to suck on plastic and whatever stuff it's made off?|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I started offering it at about 6 or 7 months just to get him used to it.  He pretty much just played with it and checked it out.  It wasn't until about 8 months that he actually started drinking from it and no longer thinking of it as a toy.  <br>  It took me about 3 different sippy cups until I found one that he could drink ot of easily.  Then he preferred only a certain type of sippy cup for a while.  It wasn't until about 12 months that he started drinking out of all different types of sippy cups.  So those extra cups I had boughten still ended up getting used.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	at six months i started to introduce it.  by 8 months he took the cup all the time except his one bottle at bedtime.  at 13 month i got rid of the bottle and he takes the sippy all the time|`|pXSKSS3daa	We introduced it at 7 months but he didn't really get the hang of it until around 9 and a half months. He's now almost 11 months and is totally on all sippy cups.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I started my daughter at five months. Now she's seven months and does pretty well with it!|`|wqchA8B7aa	10 months. When they're ready, you'll know.|`|lB8ZNNsJaa	My friend started her daughter at about 7 months, she is super smart and loves the sippy cup.

After my son got the hang of it he wouldn't take his bottle anymore. So I just gave him his formula in the sippy cup. Good luck.!|`|ooViiOLHaa	i started my son out pretty early my doctor told me that only formula should be associated with the bottle so it would be easier to phase it out so i started giving my son water in a sippy cup around 5 months|`|KeaLgcSBaa	I STARTED BOTH OF GIRLS BEFORE THEY WERE ONE....

I took her to the doctors and they said it was the fourth disease which was not contagious thank god but I was told to use the glass trick, if you get a glass and push the side of it against the spot and it fades then it's nothing to really worry about but if it doesn't then it might be meningococcal. Just take her to the doc and get him to check your little guy over, better to be safe then sorry I say.
LZAF4DYZaa	Congrats on your pregnancy!!! And yes ma'am I've had these pains as well and I'm now 15 weeks pregnant with #1. The sharp pain in the ovary......which I had at 5 weeks was my body responding to being pregnant, when you're this early your body will still react as if your about to have your period, that's why it's difficult for some to distinguish between period cramps and pregnancy cramps. mine lasted for about 5 minutes each time and they weren't as severe as regular period cramping, if they last longer than 1 hour and come more frequently than I would suggest talking to your doctor. We saw the baby at 7 weeks (looked like a blob) but it was there. I haven't had any cramping since I became 7 weeks pregnant. But an hcg level of 1500 at 5.5 weeks is quite high!!! Mine was only 304, of course we are all different, but if hcg rises to quickly that CAN BE a sign that it's an ectopic pregnany, primarily because that's what happens when you have one, it's one of the 1st indictaions.<br>  <br>  **** I get pinches ever so often and they're from my uterus expanding and making room for the baby, or if I roll over I'll get a slight ache, so those are normal, but of course if yours are unbearable I would get it looked at.
Hu9yquP4aa	I had my period for the first 3 months of my pregnancy. <br>  I had to get a blood test to verify. You can have your period and still be pregnant. <br>  <br>  Call your doctor for blood work.|`|v3LnJycKaa	i think you may be having a case of mental trickery... if you had relations on the 12th of feb a pregnancy test will generally show positive after 2-3 weeks (4-5 weeks pregnant) if you took one today and you had a period it is most likely correct in telling you negative.|`|kT7GVOosaa	if you had your period I am 99.9% sure you are not pregnant. at your age all the symptoms you feel could just be growing pains from puberty or something. and if you got your period a week after you had sex then you weren't ovulating so you would have an even slimmer chance of being pregnant.|`|AA12228565	You are to young to be worrying if you are pregnant or not!  Quit having sex is my answer!|`|xWyXbsw6aa	just take another one in a weeks time, its not uncommon to have a false  negative, <br>  <br>  try not to think too much about the symptoms - females stress too much, and start imagining things and over thinking - i do it too! :)<br>  its just what females do, good luck|`|a1uoxczTaa	you got your period after having sex. most likely you are not pregnant. i think you read the symptoms somewhere and are now 'feeling' them. no 15 year old knows they are supposed to taste metal without looking it up.|`|IkAtIQumaa	If you had sex the 12th and had your period on the 20th you're not pregnant. Use a condom every time. You should get on the pill it works great.|`|Heyz3xp9aa	it  takes atleast 1 month sometimes to determine pregnancy|`|KWJ7ju6qaa	Considering Feb. 20th was your period; i don't think you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  If you are worried; i would think twice before having sex again.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you got your period you are not pregnant....You would have gotten a postive by now if you were pregnant too. Stop freaking yourself out. You are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  I know some people will come on here and say "you can get your period when you are pregnant" but bleeding while pregnant is not common so you don't have anything to worry about really.
XB9VDLGSaa	well, later when your child grows up and only wants to eat fastfood hamburgers and pizza, would you as a mom allow it?<br>  <br>  personally I think everything in moderation.  eating hamburgers and pizza is fine but let that not be the only thing you eat.  remember that the baby is eating what you are eating.|`|AA11210211	Nothing will happen to the baby hun,that is ALL I ate when I was pregnant with my son and he is perfectly healthy.I say eat it UP.|`|vue9NOhYaa	If you are poorly nourished, it can affect baby's growth and development.  However, you'd have to be malnourished for long periods of time for it to have any effect. (Your body will provide for baby first, so YOU'D be feeling sick and lethargic from lack of nutrients before baby would be harmed.)<br>  <br>  Burgers and pizza contain lots of nutrients -- protein, iron, calcium, anti-oxidants.  There are far worse things you could be eating. <br>  <br>  Be sure to take your prenatal vitamins, and don't sweat it.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	if you are malnourished...your child would not develop correctly...if you are over nourished with empty calories - you are increasing your chances of getting gestational diabetes. which would cause your child to be too big, have to be born early....<br>  <br>  if you don't get gest. diabetes from a poor diet (but more than enough calories) basically, your baby will be fine, but your body will suffer. the baby gets the main nutrients needed and your body is left with what remains....which eating a poor diet, wouldn't be much.<br>  <br>  make sure you take your vitamin. drink water. don't eat hot dogs, they are a 'junk' food with questionable value and could cause problems down the road.<br>  <br>  but your baby will be fine. just work on eating better. order a salad at mcdonalds instead of a big mac. get a grilled chicken sandwich  (lots of protein) instead of a whopper.<br>  <br>  and don't stress, you still have time to not end up with gest. diabetes.|`|sAbah6dTaa	honestly not a whole lot to the baby, just makes you fatter. i would just balance it out, if you eat three hamburgers, then eat three something healthy!! <br>  <br>  eat what you crave or it will drive you insane!!! don't worry about what other think, as long as the doctor tells you that you are healthy and are taking the vitamins, i would NOT worry one bit!!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|mfiA5Hcwaa	Don't worry, I had a craving for fast food all the way through my pregnancy - my main craving was for fried english breakfasts - I ate at least one a day and inbetween ate mcdonals, KFC etc....my little one is now 8 months old and perfectly healthy. Good luck|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You crave goods because your body is actually craving a nutrient in those foods. It's ok to eat those things in moderation. Don't over eat them but go ahead and induldge. You apparently need something in those foods. :)|`|rDPADat1aa	The baby will take the nutrition it needs from you and you'll gain unnecessary weight.  Craving fastfood and pizza is okay, actually giving in and eating it all the time isn't.  There is nothing nutritious about fastfood.<br>  <br>  One way to make the pizza acceptable would be to make it yourself at home using whole wheat flour in the dough, healthy cheeses, and lots of veggies on top.  It may help with your cravings for it while also making it a more nutritious choice for you.  You can do the same with the burgers at home.  Buy meat that's less than 15% fat, use whole wheat buns, and add lots of veggies on top.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.  Good luck.|`|POGZZmoUaa	As long as the majority of you meals are lots of fruits and veggies then probably nothing.  If the junk food is the main part of your diet is junk then you are taking in too much salt and sugar for sure and that will not help you or the baby.  Healthy babies need healthy food.  Remember you don't have to give it to all your cravings and now is the time to protect this little one from any harm that may come it's way.  That includes your eating habits.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Honestly hun, NOTHING! lol People are gonna give me thumbs downs btu who cares. the truth is nothing will happen to your baby. I craved cheese burgers my whole pregnancy and had one every other day if not every day. my son is now 2 and perfectly healthy, he eats veggies and fruits. Eating junk food durning your pregnancy wont hurt the baby, it may make it tougher for you to lose weight after you have the baby but it doesn't hurt the baby. I even asked my doctor and he said as long as i take my prenatal everything will be fine lol.|`|Oq2B7I4faa	I don't think there is any harm eating hamburgers or pizza couple times a week.  I am 37 weeks to and I would eat say burger for lunch and for dinner I would eat something healthy.  Anyway I heard burger is high in Iron and pizza well with cheese it's high in calcium.  And I would also add more vegetalbes for the topping.  LOL|`|32a259f59d3088d2227a70c4bed9c8e6aa	If you eat junk food it won't affect the baby...all that will happen is that YOU might put on a little extra weight. But if you breast feed the weight will come off with no problem! Don't worry about it...your doctor should give you a list of foods they recommend you not eat while pregnant. Otherwise...I would say enjoy being pregnant!|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Nothing, the baby will be fine.  But even if that's what you're craving, you should still try to limit how much you have and eat other healthy foods and take your prenatals.  I went through a few phases of junk food craves when I was pregnant with my son and he was born perfectly healthy!|`|CIZjK2rAaa	You are not harming your baby.  The only possible problem would be putting on a lot of weight that will be harder to get off after the baby is born.  Please be sure to take your prenatal vitamins to be sure your baby is getting the nutrients he or she needs.|`|LkgrqlKXaa	I ate everything in site. I ate mexican food to see food to chinese food and even greasy cheeseburgers!! Of course it is better to eat healthy but it's not going to hurt your baby. It may give you heartburn! Which is horrible while pregnant But just because you're pregnant doesn't mean you can't eat what you want|`|791NVofcaa	Nothing will happen to the baby. Those foods still have nutrients, but they just have a lot of the "extra" stuff that we don't need. Try your best to minimize fast food and when your home fill up on the healthy stuff, like fresh fruit, whole grains, and lots of veggies. And water, water, and more water!
Ldvi6UPOaa	You're probably not saturating the test with enough urine, the control should always be dark enough for you to see. Now if you are pregnant and the hcg hormone is not strong enough then you may get a faint test line but the control line will always be dark. So it's either you are not saturating the test with enough urine or the the test is defective if the control line is faint.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck hun!|`|S5n5Za78aa	may have been an error you should retest with different brand tomorrow morning i like dollar store brand $ there pretty accurate and cheap|`|fYMWDQLGaa	are you taking about pregnancy tests, if yes faint line is really a positive. You are pregnant!!! be sure that its not a evaporation line. chk for evaporation lines in twoweekwait.com and google search for it.<br>  <br>  test again tomo morning. hope you see a clear test than before. Goodluck
AA11537580	I think it would be better to have the new parents take a course once they become pregnant, we had to take a marriage course before getting married so why isn't there a parenting course, just a short 1-2 day course on the basics and you are given some free books and lots of information. i know there are courses you can take but not too many people take them.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Wow you really don't have anything better to do do you? As I answered yesterday and I guess still didn't get it through your think skull, that money doesn't make the parent. There was a time where we didn't have the highest income, and we were still great parents, we managed our money, our son had all his needs a plus more, and our son was happy. Now we have a high income and are still great parents, granted our son is spoiled rotten, but we still do a good job. I've seen parents with very limited income that still have great happy and healthy kids. <br>  So what would happen if your income didn't check out and you were already pregnant? I guess a ton of babies would be aborted everyday, which is sad. Or they would be put up for adoption, and half of them wouldn't make it out of the foster care system, so most would be mistreated and forced to live in a house with 20 other kids. I think I would rather live with a family with low income.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	I think I can't say what I want to because I know that my account will be suspended.<br>  <br>  And no, it wouldn't be better. Let's have an off-the-wall example thrown in here: Britney Spears had plenty of money to support her children and look what happened there. <br>  <br>  My Point: Just because you can afford your children doesn't mean that makes you a good parent.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I don't think that would really help too much. There are people that make darn good money, yet blow it on drugs, alcohol, cars, etc. while there are people that don't make a lot of money yet make do with what they have and still provide a good life for their child/ren. It all depends on the mentality of the person, not the paycheck|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Unfortunately, s*** happens, and being able to afford kids, one day, doesn't mean you're able to, later down the road. (Especially with all these dang layoffs!)|`|LwbwMFX9aa	it would be great but it would never happen, some peopl are animals and selfish and can't control themselves|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	I don't think the amount of money parents make is the issue. I think the major problem we have with parents who go for WIC, food stamps, and welfare and such, has to do with their lack of financial control. <br>  <br>  The other day I was at the super market, and a woman was in line getting nearly $200 of formula and juice and such. Yet she had a McDonald's cup in her hand. I wonder how many cans of formula she can buy with the money she spends in fast food every month.<br>  <br>  I know one family where the husband makes approximately $2,700 a month. Mind you, he lives in California (high cost of living) and he is married to a stay at home mom (no income from her) and they have 5 children. They rent a house and are never in need, and they do not receive any form of government assistance. They do perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  So if they were to be evaluated before having another child based on their family size and income, they would most likely be denied because it doesn't appear that the father makes enough. They are considered low-income, and could easily qualify for government assistance. When in fact, he doesn't make a lot, but he is so good with financies, that they are never in need. So it would be unfair to deny him another child.<br>  <br>  How would situations like that be fairly handled?<br>  <br>  All of those parents who are on WIC, welfare, food stamps, etc. How much do they spend every month in credit card bills, fast food, junk food, the movies, etc.? If every penny that they spent on things like that was instead saved and put aside every month, I'm sure it would equal to the same amount they get in WIC and more.<br>  <br>  And how do you control a problem like that?<br>  <br>  I'm sure their are families who desperately need assistance, and do not throw their money away to useless things. But I'm sure they are also the minority.<br>  <br>  A law like that would never pass, which I'm sure you already know. Even if the system is abused, I would never vote in favor for such a thing . . . But I do get your point.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	If we lived in a perfect world where variable didn't make a difference, then ok that would work.  But be realistic.  We will never get to where China is today.<br>  <br>  I do think that people need to be held more accountable for the ratio of children they have to the amount on their paycheck.  We would not have the problems we have with children being hungry or growing up in poverty like we do today.  But you can't tell people they can't have kids based on their paychecks.  <br>  <br>  My husband makes on average about $600-700 a week.  We have two kids.  That's not much by today's standard and most people gawk and are wondering how we raise two kids with only $40K a year.  But we make it.  We manage our money and still have a little extra.  Are you going to tell me that I have no right to have children because we don't make a certain dollar amount?  I don't think so.<br>  <br>  <br>  And PS-  People report you because you antagonize others and starts unneeded drama, not because of your questions!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Yes, and pretty soon the cameras and video equipment in our homes will monitor how we parent those children, and report all our actions back to the State. It will also monitor our sexual activity levels and make sure we regularly check in with the health department after each sexual encounter to make sure we're not pregnant again accidentally. However, if you have more children than the state allows, and you lose your job and can't afford your family anymore, your child will be removed from your custody regardless and given to someone else to raise. <br>  <br>  Ahhh....the perfect society! While it sounds good on paper, I think it ultimately opens up disastrous implications. <br>  <br>  I suggest you read 1984 by George Orwell.
215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I became very ill with my first pregnancy with some sort of virus and was hospitalized. They monitiored the baby every 2-3 hours. The nurse told me that when you don't feel good the baby doesn't feel good and is less active so they were just monitoring to make sure baby was fine. I am assuming this probably follows with things like a common cold also. rest up, hope you get better soon!|`|RR7UX4jkaa	I'm glad to know that I'm not the only one worrying so much during my wife's pregnancy.<br>  My wife just got over flu while pregnant. Baby is safe and protected and is being laid back.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Do some kick counts.  Drink some cold water, and lay on your side.  You should feel him move at least 10 times in 2 hours.  If you don't, then call your Dr. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, don't worry :)|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	My baby was always active, so when she didn't move for 12 hours I would freak out. Needless to say, I'm sure they're annoyed with me at the OBGYN office. My baby sometimes moves like crazy and doesn't move for a day. I've gotten used to it since being reassured by the doctor, so I've calmed down a bit. If it makes you feel better call your doctor, if they want you to go in to be monitored go in. But from my experience you sound great. Good luck.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	it happened to me a few months ago.. i asked my doc and she said it was perfectly normal for baby to be less active when you have a cold. as long as you get your kick count in, everything is fine. so no worries.
44ujDxwqaa	depending on what shows the kids are watching..if they watch informative and educational shows like the Learning Channel, or the Discovery channel, then, it is good for them. Shows like Jerry Springer is not good for them.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	have you ever seen tv?|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	If you supervise what children watch, TV can be a great tool and opportunity to learn, however, kids who are allowed to watch what they want invariably make poor choices.<br>  <br>  I have been in homes where young kids, 7 and 8 years old are watching steamy bedroom scene on a Soap Opera with Mom, I heard one of them say, "I can't believe she is with him now, she was with the other guy last week" - that is certainly not teaching morals and values to children.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let my 11 year old watch trash like that.<br>  <br>  Remember with children's minds it is "Garbage In, Garbage Out"|`|sxecXFgraa	If it can be if there isn't a positive role model there to talk to the child about things they see on TV.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	If that is the only thing they do.<br>  <br>  But no a little tv never harmed anyone|`|kQ7aPIcAaa	To much of anything can be bad|`|rWoaRdljaa	too much TV can harm their eyes and make them unactive and not so fit in the future.
44ujDxwqaa	yes,, that is why parents need to lecture their children about safety during long walks like such.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Uphill, both ways?  LOL-just kidding!<br>  <br>  Not my children-they are homeschooled!  They do not have to leave the house (though we are out at various classes and activities more than we are home, it seems-but they are driven).<br>  <br>  Even if my chldren attend school, they would be driven-they would not ride the bus.<br>  <br>  Most parents that I know with children in public school walk their children to school on nice days, though, and drive them if the weather is cold, rainy, etc.|`|0RuNbOGlaa	I'll never understand the reasoning behind some of the parents statements regarding their children and walking to school issues.<br>    So there may be some lousy snow, or cold weather, and even rain, understand, these kids are not about to melt, or drown.<br>    Just think, you worry about them getting cold walking to school, yet when they get home what do they do mostly? Change clothes and go out to play, rain, snow or wind, they still go out and no one complains.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	so what's your point? i've noticed that in today's society kids are being spoiled and most get driven to school, even when they live a 5 minute walk away. i walked to and from school in the rain/snow/hail/sunny days all my life and i never had a problem with it. it's good for kids to get that exercise, especially if that's the only activity they get throughout the day.<br>  <br>  i'm assuming you are a kid. poor you, you have to walk to school in the rain and snow. there's bigger problems in this world.|`|SrcoG7JRaa	Boo freakin' hoo.<br>  More kids should be walking or riding a bicycle to school. I don't think we see enough of that.<br>  <br>  Get an umbrella and a pair of boots, and carry your shoes in your bag. Did that all my life, and it's not a big deal. Even in Alaska. The only time I ever got driven or drove (aside from when I was at college and had my own car) was if there was an ice storm or total white outs.<br>  <br>  Toughen up. There are people much worse off.|`|xguDqkJwaa	That's why my son rides the bus.  If he were to walk he'd probably always be late.  Never would I have him walk in rain or snow but some people just don't care.|`|HlFgIymcaa	I used to always walk, but I only lived four blocks away and we never had school when it snowed. When it rained we road our bikes.
g54tGcRvaa	Close off the area with an electric fence.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well I had no other choice but to leave them out. It took some time but I consistently told my son NO every time he went over to one, now he could care less about them. Just be consistent, tell her no every time she touches one, and eventually she will learn that it's not something she's supposed to do. I did buy some childproof things for my outlets though, I have the ones that you stick in the outlet when it's not used, and they make some that go over things that are plugged in to, those things are life savers! Do you have a rug or something you can stick the cord under? That might be a good idea too, but I think you should start teaching her now to just stay away, believe me it does take a while, but eventually it does work!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	I have them all behind furniture, as best as I can.<br>  <br>  I also don't have any quarter round in my livingroom so some were wrapped in the "cord organizer" thingies you can get from Ikea and then jammed under the baseboard for awhile.<br>  <br>  You can get some wall sconces from hardware stores (I think its Home Depot that was advertising them) that run on some sort of very flat wire that you stick to the wall and then paint over.  So that might be an option.<br>  <br>  This is what I had wrapped around a bunch of cables so I could shove them under the baseboard, it would be somewhat protective against her biting: <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/20097954" rel="nofollow">http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/produc...</a><br>  <br>  I wish I could find that "new" lighting product, its pretty neat but I think sconce is the wrong word *sigh*|`|9kMJJ1giaa	Tape, rug, discipline, and time are the only practical answers!  Can you move your furniture around to conceal it a little more, or make it harder to get at?  I suppose you could install a ceiling light if that is the only cord she bothers, and you feel you just can not teach her.<br>  <br>  I know this will sound bad, but you did ask how I did it, well I used to give my children a little pat on the hands, and sternly say NO!  I did not do it hard and it did not hurt them!  Right or wrong that is what I did.  <br>  <br>  I hope you figure out something that works for the both of you.  Good Luck!|`|AXEqOEloaa	You have no other place for the lamp? I would say the tape is a good idea.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Well, if there is no way to hide the cord behind furniture, then what you are going to want to do it get a roll of packaging tape, and tape it along the wall securly leaving no exposed cord that she can grab onto.  Run the tape along the cord up to the electrical socket. <br>  <br>  It will prevent her from playing and chewing on the cord and also prevent her from pulling the lap down on herself.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	It was a bit of a bigger deal to go to the third because you only have 2 arms when it comes to holding babies. As long as you make sure each person gets their one on one time, things will be good. <br>  My little girls love their little brother, and that makes things easy. They all love to play together and they each keep each other occupied. <br>  Once you get into a good routine, things will go as smoothly as it did with just the 2. Good luck with your decision.|`|6vyni95Laa	I have 3 and found a big difference going from 2 to 3.  <br>  <br>  *You don't have enough hands to hold onto all 3 so your oldest has to become more self-sufficient by default.  <br>  <br>  *It's much harder to keep an eye on 3 when they scatter.<br>  <br>  *Splitting snacks evenly is kinda hard when fruit roll-ups and things like that are packed in even numbers (usually 10).  Then they fight over who gets the last one.<br>  <br>  *And everything in the whole friggin world is geared for a "family of four" so your new family of 5 won't fit the rides at the amusement park, the booth at the restaurant, or the family seating at the movies.  It's a small annoyance but nevertheless you will deal with it every day.<br>  <br>  <br>  My SIL has 5 kids and she says going from 2 to 3 was the hardest, because you still had some control with 2.  But, she says once you have 3, you can have 6 because everything is always crazy & out of control anyway, so what is one more kid! <br>  ;-D lololol|`|FUNhlpiqaa	One is one, two is twenty.

IOp3knBjaa	I was 16 when I had my first. He was not planned (although I would not change it for the world). However, if I knew then what I know now I probably would've waited to even have sex. I would say she is definitely more stable than I was when I had my first, but I will still say wait. It is a bigger responsibility than alot of people realize and you never know what's going to happen. Best of luck on whatever she decides!|`|mc6YtaRbaa	I will be turning 30 on my baby's due date, so will my husband. In my opinion anyone who is not married or living together should not be having children. I know many people do have kids when they are not married and don't live with the person and it works for them and I'm not putting them down in any way, it's just my opinion based on my life experiences.|`|AA10186411	I was 21.  She needs to wait until this guy marries her.  I dated a guy for 4 years and was engaged, but I got pregnant beforehand and he ditched us.  Its far too easy for them to walk away.  I NEVER saw it coming.  She needs to get married...and enjoy each other for a few years, and then add to the family.  Once you have a child, you no longer have a personal life!|`|AA11661793	I was 21 when I got pregnant, 22 when I had the baby. I think that if you are financially stable, in a stable relationship and feel you are ready for the responsibility then to go for it.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I was 15...one month from my 16th birthday. I was not planning it either.<br>  My second baby I was 19. (got pregnant on my honeymoon)<br>  My third I had just turned 21.(born same month as me) <br>  My fourth I had just turned 23. (same month as me.)<br>  <br>  She should wait though. 18 is very young.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	I was 23. I couldn't imagine doing this at 18.|`|sdtqTbmoaa	ill be 29 when my lil one is due|`|wxbGmxbOaa	I was 18 when I found out I was pregnant and I turned 19 in December 08'. My baby girl is due May 16th.<br>  <br>  So far everything is going great for me, although my pregnancy wasn't planned, I wouldn't change it for the world. I already love my little girl who is growing inside of me. I am still with my bf, the father of our baby. We will be together for 4 years on the first of June, so not quite a month after she is due. We have a really good relationship and we're both preparing ourselves for parenthood. Neither of us regret our little one and we're both excited about being parents. Although we both know we should have probably waited to have a child, only because we're young and both still fully planning on going to college, having a baby is going to make it harder, but defiantly not impossible for us to do this.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to your sister to finish high school and if she plans to go to college she should try and finish that first before bringing a baby into the world. Only because it will make it a little more difficult for her when she goes to attend college. It's possible though my bf and I are proof of that. Oh and by the way my bf is also 19.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	I was 24 and I was married.  I think it is possible for an 18 year old to do a good job of raising a baby, but I don't think that an 18 year old should get pregnant on purpose.  She may have a good job now, but nobody is guaranteed that they have a job for life.  Besides, once she has the baby she may realize that she doesn't want to work.  My advice to any 18 year old thinking about having a baby would be to finish school, get married and then think about having a baby.|`|4AZp8Quwaa	i'm 23 and 35wks pregnant with my first baby. i'll be 24 a month after she's born.|`|ioZeveazaa	I wouldn't say a 18 year old should have a baby. I would wait a few more years and save up some money and try to get a house established along with a job that will last. She has a good job but if she waits a few years she can hopefully get ahouse and have some money saved. She can also maybe be married. I am 23 this June and having my first baby this Saturday. Me and my husband and both financially stable and ready. Good luck to you and your sister!|`|AA11210211	I was 21 with my first and 24 with my second,I personally would wait.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	There is no such thing as a job for life- you can ask the 700,000 people who lost their jobs in the month of February it you want to hear about that.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	i was 34 with my first child. im glad i waited i wouldnt give up all the experiences i had in my 20's, most of the stuff i did i couldnt/wouldnt of had the chance to do if i had a child.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I got pregnant when I was 22 but I will be 23 when she arrives.

vwuMTm7Saa	There is a pressure point about 6 inches above the inside of the ankle and the one between your thumb and first finger.  Look up labor induction + pressure points and it will show you how to stimulate these points.  It worked for me.  My doctor needed to induce 3 week early with me and I tried this a day and a half before and went into labor on my own.|`|OPTDFRuzaa	I would stick with anything that lets gravity help you out as it will help. just because you went over due with your other 2 does not mean you will this time. i hope you dont have to wait too long good luck!|`|3DZKxxuZaa	drink castor oil..u will definetly go for labor

Do you have irregular periods?|`|oche3k5taa	you are really late on your period, but if more than one test has said negative, your probably not.<br>  however you should go to the doctor if it doesnt come soon,, there might be something different wrong with you.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	If you haven't had a period since December, you need to go consult a Dr.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	You are not pregnant !!

K2jT1z5jaa	its kinda hard to tell because you've had a period then you had an odd period which is sign of pregnancy - implantation possibly.<br>  The prec*m does contain sperm darling..<br>  <br>  its possible that you are having effects from the antibiotics. but you could be pregnant- Ask them to take your bloods because urine test doesnt always pick up pregnancy - can show neg when actually pos.<br>  <br>  god bless x|`|bxlYleZkaa	I think you are just stressed and your docs appointment will confirm you are not pregnant.|`|mXXer2xJaa	I would say if you've had 2 periods since then your probably not pregnant, white discharge is pretty normal to have any time, unless its particularly gunky or gross I'd say you have nothing to worry about|`|b3f57373a0112a4463000fda7f1e950baa	If you had your period since then, you aren't pregnant. Take a pregnancy test anyway just to quiet your fears.|`|pjrRbgnIaa	take a pregnancy test! der!
xLmtXZJ0aa	Everyones symptoms are different, why not take a pregnancy test?|`|QB5D0rG4aa	Your body increases the level of the hormone progesterone as it adapts to pregnancy, which makes you feel tired. This is a temporary condition that usually passes away during the second trimester of pregnancy with intermittent episodes coming back on the third.<br>  <br>  Another sign that may be observed is in your breast, becoming more tender, swollen and sensitive because the increasing levels of hormones during this stage making you feel discomfort until during the first trimester while your body adjusts to pregnancy hormonal changes.<br>  <br>  Other symptoms include nausea or vomiting, food aversions, increased sensitivity to odors, frequent urination, higher body temperature than usual and of course the missed period.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	It is way too early for you to be having pregnancy symptoms. I think in your case, your body may be sore from you fighting a cold, or you ovulating right now before you start your period. and if you used protection I wouldn't be too worried!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	a missed period comes first- morning sickness and all the other stuff usually occurs around 6 weeks pregnant which is 2 weeks after your missed period|`|c1de8b0505a79fcad4bedc3b6eac4556aa	nausea, headaches, dizzyness, sore breasts, using the toilet more than usual|`|9495fb73bc86a679704488ac8203581baa	You have REALLY sore breasts, thirsty, slight cramping, urinate more, nasuesa, and you are extremly tired. Although, these symptoms usually don't start until after you are able to find out  if you are pregnant. I would say probably in your second month. So, if you used the condom correctly and it didn't break then you probably aren't, but you can't be 100% sure...ever. So, if you don't get your period def take a preg test.|`|kYkKcQJ2aa	The great signs of pregnancy<br>  1. Boobs hurt BAD! Sore to the touch!<br>  2. Constipated - can't feel sexy if you can't poop! LOL<br>  3. Cramping like your period but worse-your uterus is growing<br>  4. Take a birth control test - it's the only one that can tell you first.<br>  Good Luck!|`|4GwTDea1aa	More than likey its just your illness or in your head.. sometimes the mind tricks the body into believe something it doesnt have! Also if you barely had sex sunday its WAY too early to be experiencing symptoms and would worry too much if you used proctection..<br>  Good Luck|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Those are both symptoms of pregnancy and of getting your period soon.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Not normal, but not horrible either. Some women gain weight some women dont. Im sure everything will level off as long as you stick to a good diet and a little excercise. No need for worries.|`|ioZeveazaa	I agree with the first commentor. It is probably water weight and bloating. Don't feel bad about weight gain though. I am due this Saturday and have gained 55 lbs!! I was 120 prepregnancy. It is ok though because you can lose all the weight after pregnancy. =) Good luck!!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Just be careful of what you eat and how much you eat from now on and make sure you get lots of exercise. 6 weeks is a little early to have already gained 5 lbs. I can see maybe by the end of 1st trimester gaining that much.|`|04kOtcGgaa	i was 105 when i got pregnant now at 35 weeks i'm 138. i'm 16 and 5'3 my doctor told be because i was underweight and under age i needed to gain 40 to 45 ponds. from the very beginning i only gained Weight at 6 weeks i didn't gain 5 pounds i only gain 1 or 2. but for you and this pregnancy it's probably normal. and don't worry about gaining to much unless your doctors says your gaining to much. and plus gaining weight in pregnancy is great and you can always lose it after you have the baby. i always think that losing my body is worth my son. i'd rather have him than have the best body.|`|AXEqOEloaa	You're gonna need to have to deal with it, that is what happens when you choose to get pregnant. Everyone and every pregnancy is different, so really there is a wide range of normal.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Most of it is probably water and bloating dont worry :)|`|8LBl7HgAaa	Girl,dont even worry about it. Its mostly bloating. I am also 6+ weeks and I'm pretty sure i've gained weight. I even have a tummy showing already! (but mostly bloated cuz the baby is tiny) So dont worry about it, and you are not the only one.
UFu0h8SKaa	You are the only person who can answer this question! Are you really worried about claiming benefits, or is it coping with life without him that you're worried about? If you're unhappy leave, but if you can't do this alone then you need to look into finding some support, whether it's family, friends or an association of some kind.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	I am also disabled and cannot work so my partner supports me, but if I was as unhappy as you sound then i'd have to leave and do what was best for my child. Or in your case children.|`|claUGpVRaa	If you hate being with him and there is an atmosphere that will affect the children, then you need to leave for yours and their sakes. Being unhappy is not fair on you.<br>  Yes, you may have to go on benefits, but he will be obliged to support you and your children still so you won't be as badly off as you think you may be.<br>  Good luck for your futures|`|fjZeVLOQaa	if it was me i would rather be on benifits than stay with a man who i didnt want to be with,and u have to think of ur children what affect is it havin on them,good luck|`|vj93MNjBaa	You'll get maintenance $$$.

WPI0Z47saa	She isn't sleeping because you keep giving into her. This is the 5 step process my doctor gave me and it worked. <br>  <br>  First night if she cries then go in her room, pick her up and comfort her, tell her it is time to sleep and put her back down and leave the room. Do not spend more than 10 minutes in there. You can repeat this up to 5 times in one night but after that you let her cry.<br>  <br>  Second night go in DO NOT pick her up but you can rub her back or hug her while in her crib. Tell her it is time to sleep and leave. You can repeat this 5 times as well then let it go.<br>  <br>  Third night, go in do not go near the crib,stand across the room and talk to her, tell her it is time to sleep and leave. Repeat up to 5 times.<br>  <br>  Fourth night only stand in the door way, do not touch her but talk to her, give same speech and leave.<br>  <br>  Fifth night do not open the door. Tell her from the hallway that it is time to sleep. <br>  <br>  This worked for me and 3 of my friends now. It feels mean and is hard to hear your child cry but you can not let them decide the rules or she will be sleeping in your bed forever.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps good luck.<br>  <br>  Oh and I would not recommend the toddler bed at that age unless she is climbing out of her crib and poses a danger to herself. If you don't have control of her in her crib, imagine if she were mobile and able to leave the room on her own or even if she roamed around her room. My nephew used to pull the drawers out of his dresser and it fell and almost landed on him. Keep them in the crib as long as you can granted they stay in it safely.|`|jcEtRUVZaa	This worked for us:<br>  <br>  How to Get a Baby, Toddler or Child to Fall Asleep<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-toddler-child-fall-asleep.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/ehow_4767974_baby-to...</a>|`|47iSxQALaa	We had a similar problem with our daughter.  She was a horrible sleeper.  We never did the cry-it-out method, but eventually it was too tiring to walk  her every night (that was what we had to do to get her back to sleep).  The thing that seemed to work was to just be in the room, when she woke up, we put her back down gently but firmly.  We did not give her anything (like a pacifier), but just insisted that she lay down.  We'd rub her back or belly (whichever way she was oriented) and she'd go back to sleep.  For many nights one of us would more-or-less hang in the room (usually had a laptop with us).  Eventually she just slept through the night.  It seems important for some children to know their parents are near.|`|Cah6nfV5aa	My daughter is 17 months and did the same thing. I just quit giving in. I left her in there and would go in every 15 mins till she went to sleep. After a few nights she started sleeping through the night. Good luck.
HCmAoNjzaa	You will ovulate in the next 12-36 hours. I use those same test strips and they work great for me.|`|WBw9lDG8aa	i think you should be ovulating within the next 24 hrs - 48 hr but just to make sure i think u should start BD tonight just so u could be covered and remember do it every other day so u could let ur hubby lil swimmer get stronger good luck..
kyqhMuSiaa	It's all to do with baby making themselves at home for a while. Sometimes it feels like a whole sports team in there. Enjoy :)
EkZDP3Oyaa	You can dropp eggs any time during your cycle, even while you are on your period.  So you prolly ovulated while you were on your period|`|kbIkVS0raa	Same thing happened to me lol and I was told that I most likely ovulated towards the end of my period or on the last day or day after it ended. Semen can live inside of you for a couple days so you could have concieved during your period and then ovulated a few days later. It doesn't make sense to me either but all I care about is my baby boy is healthy. Good luck and congrats|`|kT7GVOosaa	you don't have to ovulate to become pregnant it is just more likely that you will become pregnant if you are ovulating.|`|NVVTTwm4aa	maybe ovulation started near to the end of your period|`|W1GHZW3Caa	not soon enough|`|2BatkpPtaa	how old are you??|`|Zkvkfafeaa	Sperm can stay alive inside the body for up to three days.

I remember the other women there, I remember the clock on the wall, I remember the doctor telling me to keep my bum over the cup so blood doesnt go everywhere, i remember the nurse holding my shoulders down. Most of all I remember the feeling. Not in my mind, I still physically feel the pain. <br>  I was irresponsible, and when i got pregnant, everyone said hey, just get an abortion, its only a clump of cells. Well they were wrong. I was 12 weeks and 5 days pregnant. That was a BABY. I have a 2 year old now, and I know at 12 weeks she was a baby. The baby you are going to kill, is a baby. <br>  Im not judging you, i just want you to see, from a person who did it themselves, how horrible it is. <br>  I will never forget what I did, i couldnt if i wanted to.<br>  No one ever regrets having a baby, but alot regret abortion. <br>  I regret my abortion. And now I have to live with the pain, both emotional and physical forever. <br>  really think about this, its not as cut and dry as they want you to think.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I think the pill makes it look like a miscarriage.. I am not sure .. so don't quote me on it. It is less pain full then all the other methods. so I guess that is ur best bet. but if u wanna do an abortion why don't u do it the normal way. cause I AM TELLING u this will be something u will regreat in the long run<br>  <br>  but next time make sure u use protection or get on birth control so u don't have to have an abortion. I am against abortion and the other person that answered the question is rite. this isn't the place to ask abortion questions.|`|miPubuDYaa	THe abortion pill? Well there is no one step abortion pill.<br>  <br>  The morning after pill does not cause abortions. It is to be taken up 72 hours after unprotected sex. If you concieve before taking the pill you are pregnant this pill will not due anything.<br>  <br>  There is RU486. However that pill is also given with a shot. This have a 90% chance of working upto 8weeks pregnant<br>  <br>  And then there is mexotrate. Which is a shot and then up to 3 days later you need to insert a pill into your vagina. This has a 85% chance working upto 8 weeks pregnant,<br>  <br>  If you take these drugs and you do not lose the baby you will have to go have a surgical abortion otherwise your baby will be born with many deformaties<br>  <br>  None of these options are NATURAL and all are scary.|`|MFsuN8Doaa	To be honest, this isn't the place to be asking that sort of question. A lot of people here are pro-life, so you've just opened a gateway of 'Don't do it'.|`|0vpDDM8aaa	no matter which way you choose to abort...you are killing that baby.  "the hard truth" is a good online video to watch before making such a decision.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	I agree with Michelle. This is the wrong topic and place to bring up such a controversial subject.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I believe it is called medical abortion. Unless you are talking about "planB" which is a pill you take within 72 hours after unprotected sex. That is the same as abortion as well. Anyway...I am pro choice all the way. The "abortion" pill needs to be taken 3 separate times I believe. You can look it up on the internet. It is very similar to having a miscarriage, and you can have lots of bleeding. From what I have read, having a surgical abortion is more safe than taking the pill.<br>   Best of luck to you.|`|KjVKNjwNaa	you can ask whatever question here you feel is needed...its freedom of speach..if people dont approve of your question...move on...dont answer anything!! god people are freakin amazin!! I used the 72hr pill the very next morning after finding the condom had broke..didnt get pregnant! thank god :)
FTW82Wumaa	Mine has just increased mostly.<br>  I have alot of clear to light milky looking discharge.<br>  It's kinda annoying too though haha. <br>  Sorry tmi.|`|AA11609300	I have a ton of clear discharge.|`|aGYvN9pfaa	I didn't notice a huge change in consistency, but the odor changed.
D78jfOMZaa	Just wait till she finds her feet all you'll see is a cute butt lol|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Oh.... cute..... I miss those days. <br>  <br>  My son is 13 months old and is a terror...:).   He is terrorizing the cat constantly.  Pulling every toy he has out of his toy chest and throwing them about, and trying to help mommy with everything.  I put away tubberware and pots and pans, he pulls them out for me.   I bring a basket of laundry in the living room to fold, he pulls all the clothes out and disperses them everywhere, then he trys to pull my folded clothes piles down.  I change his diaper, he tries to help by reaching in there,  I make the bed, he trys to pull the blankets off..... oh.... he's such a busy man!|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My daughter is smiling so much now - not only when I talk to her in a silly voice but if I make a face at her I get a small grin as well. She can also hold her head up quite far off the ground now :) my daughter is nosey too - she loves looking over my shoulder when I hold her lol.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Aww their so cute when they start to do that, if it only lasted longer! My sons into everything, his new fascination is the DVD player, he knows how to turn it on, open it, and put stuff on it, *ugh*, and today he managed to get a pack of crackers out of the pantry, open them, eat them and spit them back out in a little trail around the house. Just wait until they get about 13 months old like my son, that's when they are really fun, I have alot of fun with my son.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Noah will be 11 months old on the 4th and he gets into EVERYTHING. Either by crawling or cruising. <br>  <br>  My house used to be clean.... :( Lol. I love that he's exploring but I wish he'd slow down at some point!|`|SjX72fPyaa	My daughters 5 months and is laughing at her reflection now. At the moment shes really not agreeing with me on the idea of a nap!! lol|`|R8bXuLbTaa	SAME AS PAUL S|`|fdceaa401c42420a6b05129fc81a4757aa	My eldests 15 months and just causes all sorts of havoc, as I tidy the toys away, he pulls them back out again. He has a real habit of hiding my mobile and the tv remotes in places i never think of looking. He does make me chuckle! My youngest is 4 months and he's found his voice too, squeals at everything and has got a real hearty laugh when he's tickled. Follows his brother right round the living room with his eyes, probably thinking he's a bit mad!|`|c9NuCZnaaa	my son oscar is nine months as of tomorrow and he's crawling like a good'un now. you leave him alone in a room for a nanosecond to grab the mail...you come back and he's in a completely different place! usually by the bookshelf trying to reach for things!<br>  He pulls himself up on things too. and he babbles loads. he had a full day of saying "dadda" now he just says "babababababaaa"<br>  He still finds his hands facinating. You could put tons of toys around him and he will sometimes just sit and yell at them!! ahaha.|`|Yag18aVKaa	My son is two months and 10 days.Certain times throughout the day he will just "talk" and smile.He is starting to scoot up when I place him on his stomach and he loves to turn over.He has also found his hands and loves to stick them in his mouth.I can just sit there and stare at him all day long.Every time he does something I yell at my husband to come look LOL.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	I remember those days! When my kids were sweet and innocent...I miss them!<br>  Right now my 3 1/2 year old son is terrorizing my 2 year old daughter. It is rather loud, and I am really looking forward to nap time.<br>  Now my son is in time out until lunchtime! (about 7 minutes), and my daughter is crying in my lap. Ahhh the joys of parenthood!<br>  Congrats on your new baby, and enjoy the innocence while it lasts! :)|`|qjDxKXENaa	my little girl is 6 and a half months old and she is a sleep at the moment but we bought her a walker yesterday and she loves it. she presses on music buttons then dances,she is so cute.|`|1NDHSSqwaa	My little boy is eating some pringles (a rare treat for him) and is also starting to walk unaided for a few steps before falling over.|`|KEDqnEEjaa	Mostly emptying the bookcase of all of our books, switching the TV on and off and wanting to walk everywhere!
XLsnuAqmaa	i have only taken it once.  you usually get your period within 10 days.  i highly doubt you are pregnant because you took it right away.|`|AA12010220	I have taken it twice in the past, and in both times I started my period a week before it was due.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	Ooh, you know, I'm not sure this is the best category for this question...
Er3imE5Yaa	My boobs have been sore aswell but lucky for you, you know when your af is starting lol i dont! haha!  <br>  <br>  Well about the boobs thing can be a symptom of pregnancy or a sign that your af is soon to show.  If your af doesnt show on time take a test and let us know!<br>  <br>  BABY DUST!|`|QB5D0rG4aa	wait the week and if it doesn't come get a test. good luck.|`|sR3gcvubaa	I had a very sore chest a couple weeks ago and thought (hoped) I was prego, but it turned out it was just pms. Not every month do I feel that soreness so I'm not sure why some months I do and some I don't.  Be patient (believe me I know it's hard) and wait until you're actually late. That way you won't see a bfn if you don't have to! Hope this is your month!|`|9U37oyMsaa	try the dollar store brand test they showed positive earliest for me!|`|V8JoRHnnaa	yes take early pregnancy test <br>  Baby Dust|`|IH2QCj3caa	take a pregnancy test|`|bV8jkkegaa	listen i had sex 2 weeks agoo today and i think i am because for the past 2 days i been getting reall tired and my lower back is hurting and my boobs are sore but i have no idea what to do ? but in my opinion i think your should wait the week and if it doesnt come get a test, im takeing one friday you should let me know how yours goes and ill let you know how mine goes.

VdTn7Gmbaa	Wow.  I know how you feel.<br>  Been there, done that.<br>  The thing is, we cannot be responsible for the consequences of other people's actions (i.e., irresponsibility, no place to live.).  <br>  <br>  It's easier said than done, but I would suggest that you stop enabling them to be dependent upon you.  Tell them both in a "family meeting" that you love them, but things are getting tough on you financially, and they need to start looking for a place to live.  Give them a deadline date, as well.  If they don't believe you, put it in writing. <br>  It's seems almost cruel to do things like that with those with love, doesn't it?   Next time hubby buys a steak, enclose it in paper you can write on, and write:  Do Not Touch.  Belongs to "Hubby."<br>  ((((smile))))<br>  Good luck and God bless.<br>  Oh, and here's one more thing:<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  This is s something I read once that really helped me:<br>  I pray it helps you:<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Letting go does not mean to stop caring;<br>  it means I can't do it for someone else.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to cut myself off;<br>  it's the realization that I can't control another.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to enable,<br>  but to allow learning from natural consequences.<br>  <br>  Letting go is to admit powerlessness;<br>  which means the outcome is not in my hands. <br>  <br>  Letting go is not to try to change or blame another;<br>  it's to make the most of myself.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to care for, but to care about<br>  it's to allow another to be a human being.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to be in the middle, arranging all the outcomes;<br>  it's to allow others to affect their own destinies.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to be protective; it's to permit another to face reality<br>  it's not to deny, but to accept.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to nag, scold or argue;<br>  but to search out my own shortcoming and correct them.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to adjust everything to my desires;<br>  but to take each day as it comes and cherish myself in it.<br>  <br>  Letting go is not to criticize and regulate anybody;<br>  but to try to become what I dream I can be.<br>  <br>  Letting go is to not regret the past, but to grow and live for the future;<br>  Letting go is to fear less and love more.<br>  <br>                                                                     Author Unknown<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You have no choice. Set a date and give them a kick.|`|aQQ4uQhdaa	tell them that they need to get serious about working and making money. and that she needs to become a little bit more serious. this is the real world and you cant take care of them both forever. Charge rent. See how much both of them make and come up with a price that you feel is appropriate.|`|qI5W6eyjaa	Don't worry they will find some where to go. If they have kids i would say the kids could stay but they have to go. They just taking Advantage of you.|`|PTdy6TWRaa	Even if they were contributing it's still hard to blend two families like this. Part of the problem now is that you see no end in sight for what's going on in your home. You need a light at the end of that tunnel.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you give them a deadline for when you want them to move out. Make it fair and reasonable. That date will be your light at the end of the tunnel.  When you see that light maybe life will become less stressful. Hang in there.

vue9NOhYaa	If there was no penetration, the odds of pregnancy are remote.  Add to that, if you were on your period you probably weren't at  your fertile time.<br>  <br>  You are not pregnant.

wTYh7DiSaa	Do not go poking yourself down there to see what's going on. Leave it to the professional to do that. When you go see your OB they will do a cervical exam, they will tell you whether you are closed or dilated.<br>  <br>  Anyway, during pregnancy your cervix feels like puckered lips, and as soft as your lips or the tip of your nose depending on the cervical change.|`|56238df610f5337752dc7843453a522daa	see your OB
H0fXySX9aa	just tell him money is tight and food and bills must come first|`|hKJIDdVqaa	I know that is a tough one. May I suggest having him do little jobs, shoveling, raking, mowing,  I don't know at his age he can do little odd jobs or chores.  Perhaps he can save money and buy his own things.  My kids are young 7,9,10 and have prepaid cell phones.  IPods are $49 at walmart. Handheld gaming systems can be bought used at video game stores or online.  TV in his room, no biggy my kids have tv's in their rooms, they never watch TV. edit* FYI my son has a tv in his room, he is a high honor student being #1 in a grade of 120 students.  So having a tv in your room does not necessarily mean a dumb kid.  Applying yourself makes you smart and achieve the things you want.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	Tell him that those are great goals for him.  Let him know that those luxuries are expensive, but he is more than welcome to start working to earn these things.  Give him a small allowance and make him save for the things he really once.  Show him the value of money and responsibility.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	He's 8 years old and he wants all that stuff?! <br>  <br>  Say no and tell him money doesn't grow on trees. That's what my parents told me. It motivated me to get a work permit when I was 14. I am now a very happy and well adjusted adult. <br>  <br>  Life is tough sometimes! We can't get what we want all the time.|`|sxecXFgraa	I'm with you on no cell phone or TV/computer in the bedroom.  Start giving him an allowance and tell him he has to save for it himself.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	I think it's important to teach kids very early on about the importance or lack thereof of material possessions.  Whether you have the funds or not, these things like a tv in the bdrm, handheld gaming system, etc. are not important.  of course, kids want them, but their is too much value on them in today's society and kids are turning into little spoiled brats.  use the fact that you can't afford this stuff as a gift in teaching your son what's really important.  let him shovel snow, rake leaves, get a paper route to earn some cash if he really wants something.  he might be upset now, but he'll learn aobut self confidence and self esteem.|`|xIlIbZJtaa	I think a lot of us will totally understand you. Do you use freecycle.com where you can offer or collect all manner of items for free? We got our children a trampoline and a large TV for free because some kind people no longer needed them! We offered our handheld games consol because our son didn't use it. Its not only a great way to get things for free but it saves the environment due to reuse rather than landfill and also you can teach children values etc as you can ask them to find an item they no longer want to offer to another child. <br>  You can sell their outgrown clothes or unwanted items  on ebay and let them use the money from their stuff to buy a cheap games console or whatever they choose. <br>  Otherwise rather than 'We'll see', just say "We all want and need things right now. I am going to get your (ie school trousers) next week and I really need (ie glasses), but when we get a bit more money we'll see if we can get you a music player in the sale. We don't have that much money at the moment but soon it will be better" So he knows its not a fobb off, not forever, and that you really do want to get it but there are other needs that have to come first.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	Eight year olds have no business carrying a cell phone. My step son is about to turn thirteen next month and asked for one! We said no way. I do think that the idea to give him a small allowance so that he can learn the value of money is an excellent idea. If he decides to save up for something really expensive maybe you could afford to meet him halfway! That way your not really telling him no but making a compromise.|`|p07RwZK2aa	I think the sentence 'Money doesn't grow on trees honey' is my favourite sentence at the moment.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	At 8 he should be able to understand whats going on and that you aren't saddled with money. I think he's pretty selfish for not trying to understand. Just sit him down and tell him he's not a child. I knew from a young age that my mom and i didn't have a lot and even as a young child (5/6) i would ask my mom can we afford this and if she told me no i would just try and play with it as much as possible in the stores. At 8 he should know better and not make you feel bad. Everyone is going through hard times and we're all just trying to make it. Explain it to him as best you can if he still wants to be insensitive to it then don't make yourself feel bad. Do what he said and just say no when he asks, no explanation or anything.  It'll be ok don't beat your self up please.|`|AA11481889	You shouldn't burden children with financial woes in my opinion.  <br>  I think it's important to teach them the value of money...but they shouldn't have to lose sleep at night fretting over something they can't fully understand.  <br>  <br>  That being said...the best way to teach them the value of money...is to have them earn their own.<br>  <br>  Have him do chores for an allowance and let him earn money and when he saves up for what he wants...he can decide if "fitting in" is worth wasting his hard earned money.  He might surprise you.<br>  <br>  Also, there's something to be said for acknowledging "needs" vs "wants"  <br>  <br>  I can't even begin to imagine why an 8 year old would "need" a cell phone or a TV in their room.  My son won't have either at that age and it has nothing to do with money or lack there of...it has to do with the fact that children don't need those things...period.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do, in my opinion, is be honest.  Don't procrastinate with a "we'll see" because he can see through it and you'll lose credibility.  <br>  <br>  Just make up your mind on what is ok and what is not (like for me cell phone and bedroom TV are not ok but a music player is fine) and then come up with a reasonable way for the child to earn the money himself.  <br>  <br>  Not only will he learn a lesson in the importance and value of money, but he'll have the satisfaction of having earned his own savings and he'll get the opportunity to purchase his treasured item on top of it all.<br>  <br>  And as an added bonus, Dad comes off looking decisive and wise and fair.<br>  <br>  *********************<br>  Also, I don't know if he has specific brand name items in mind...but MP3 Players come as cheap as 15 bucks now a days and some of these items can be purchased for ludicrously low prices on sites like Ebay...just something to keep in mind.|`|AA11981363	You should explain what it takes to earn money and the difficult times we are living right now. I would dare to guess money is tight probably in every house right now, they only thing you "owe" him are love, food, and a roof over his head. Teach him the value of money, explain to him why you can affiord all these things (mortgage, bills, etc). <br>  <br>  TV in his room? NO, I wouldn't get him one even if I could afford it. TV is a privilege that must be earn by getting good grades, helping around the house, etc. <br>  <br>  Cellphone? sorry, he doesn't need one. He can have one the day he can pay the bill himself.<br>  <br>  I was taught all these things yet I grew up in a family were money was not tight, but values were taught.|`|XlhBBZPxaa	woah step back and re read your question your son is 8 there is no way I would get my 8 year old son a cell phone. We don't even have cable TV and he certainly doens't have a tv in his room. He does however have a Nintendo DS but his father gave him that for Christmas<br>  ( honestly I think it is the only thing he has bought for my son that he wanted ) My son doesn't even play with the nintendo DS it was cool for about 3 weeks then NOTHING.... More money waisted<br>   I tell my son the truth about the finances at this point he needs to know how to earn a dollar and he needs to know the signifigance of a dollar I make him do chores around the house to earn his extra cash and it isn't that much maybe a quarter or so for raking leaves he has to earn his money ... don't worry I think it is just to fit in at school or with his friends just be honest with the little guy he will respect you more for it|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	For hundreds of years, children have wanted stuff that parents can't afford - I'm sure that the early Pioneers in America went through the same thing -<br>   <br>  "Hey Father, may I have a new, bigger horse, all my friends have a better horse than me?"  <br>  <br>  or "My Bow and Arrows are not as big as my friend's, can I have a better quiver and bow, huh?"<br>  <br>  imagine, a young man in Ancient Rome - "Everybody has better slaves than I do, why can't I go to the Slave Auction and get a better one?"<br>  <br>  Young people have always wanted more, and more, and more from their parents, but listen carefully ..........<br>  <br>  Your job is to provide everything your child NEEDS, not everything he WANTS!|`|UbnKabQOaa	U may not find this helpful but buy him little things like toys from dollar store. and he's 8 so he doesntt need a cellphone|`|gdg3We80aa	I never had a television in my room, and studies show children do better in school if they don't have a TV in their room, so don't beat yourself up about that.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of cheap, nice music players out there, I'm assuming he's asking for something like an ipod. But at target there are little 20$ and cheaper ones that work just as well.<br>  <br>  Finally, I didn't get a cell phone until I was 14, and even then I hardly used it, i also agree that 8 is WAY to young to have a cell phone.  <br>  My parents rule was 8th grade graduatioin was when I got a cell phone, since the children are growing up so fast now, maybe you could say 6th grade.<br>  <br>  I think you should say no, not because things are to expensive, but because at the age of 8, he doens't NEED them.<br>  Kids only need cell phones when they're going out with friends to the movies, or to eat, at 8 you don't go much farther then a friends house.
wKuQC4yTaa	Your hymen does not have to break to get pregnant. And you can't get pregnant if you don't have sex. Minus IVF|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Unless sperm gets INTO your vagina you can't get pregnant. If sperm got into your vagina somehow it doesn't matter that you've not had sex or still have your hymen, you could still get pregnant.

mDYsr62maa	About the only thing you can do is let him fall.  If he was really hurting himself he'd stop.  Instead he has been training you to pay attention to him by his behavior.  He sees that that activity get him the reward he wants.  Take away the reward and the activity will stop.  Just remember that kids his age are made to bounce.
b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	yes i had spotting a weeek after my period ended. The spotting got more frequent and turned into like a period. I found out I was 4 wks pregnant and just had had a miscarriage.
JtbeH1Mgaa	My boys just turned 3 & 4 and they like doing a lot of the same things that they liked at 2 & 3.  They had quiet a few toys that they played with so that kept them entertained for a while.  When they got bored with toys we moved on to other activities.  They love for me to play with them so I help them build stuff with their Lego's and other blocks.  We would all sit at the kitchen table together and finger paint, use sponges and brushes to paint with and color with markers, colored pencils and crayons.  You can buy the kid friendly products at Walmart & at some Dollar Stores.  I also play games with them on the computer.  They love this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thomasandfriends.com/usa/index.asp?origref=" rel="nofollow">http://www.thomasandfriends.com/usa/inde...</a><br>  <br>  It has Thomas the Train, Barney, Bob the Builder, Angelina Ballerina,  Pingu, Fireman Sam, Rainbow Magic, Fifi and the Flowertots & Roary the Racing Car.  There is games, a page with activities that include coloring sheets, Paint an engine and printable coloring sheets.  It also includes more.<br>  <br>  You can also try making play-dough.  I tried it with my little boys today and they loved it.  It was messy though.

As soon as possible in your area, try letting them outside to run off the excess energy.  It only works for a couple of hours before they are recharged.  Boys are generally more active so climbing and running types of activities are best.  There are some great whiffle ball stands that are designed for toddlers and they can take turns hitting and running after the ball.  Or, in these green times and with energy conservation in mind, there are the large wheels they can run in and could be attached to a generator to produce electricity.<br>  <br>  "B", great site.  Bookmarked that one.

AA10624857	Seriously, you need to let this woman go and move on with your own life. She's playing mind games with you and you need to think better of yourself than having any type of relationship with someone who treats you this way. It may vary depending on the state she lives in, but in most cases if a couple is married, it doesn't matter if she has a baby by another man, the child is considered to be legally the husband's even if the child isn't biologically his. She's telling you all types of things you shouldn't believe. For instance, her husband will not be kicked out of the military if his wife has a baby fathered by another man. That is nonsense. I suggest very strongly you forget about this woman, she's probably not even pregnant. Change your phone number and move some place else. If she is still married to her husband and they share the same last name than the baby will have the same last name as well, probably. Count this as a time in your life when things were a mess and move on to something better for yourself.|`|zwctZ812aa	In CA courts pay for paternity tests if a child support or child custody order is requested.  Ya, you will have to pay support but you will be given some visitation.  Of course it's worth it, this may be your child.|`|CZg79Qy9aa	Get ahold of yourself and your LIFE.  Stop moving form girl to girl and living with them.  No girl is going to validate you.  She LIED to you...she is not pregnant and if she is pregnant its probably not yours.  She did it because she was jealous and wanted you back.  When she got you back, like she wanted...she ran away from you. YOu need to learn what you love in life.  Get in one spot and stay there. Get a job, friends, and stable.  Later if the baby turns out to be yours...you will be ready and if not...you will still be stable and have friends.  Calm your wings down and grow some roots.  Women are mostly evil and vindictive...your young, but you will learn.|`|crspNObZaa	well if the baby is yours do  you want him/her? do you want to be a part of that childs life if it is yours? if the answers are yes then fight like hell, and try to get custody|`|drrzUcK6aa	Wow, I was going to check on this tomorrow but thanks for all the good answers and so fast. I had a feeling she has to have their last name since they're married and that maybe I should just wait until she's grown up some to see her. For those who said she's not pregnant, i've seen pictures of her recently, she's really starting to show. I can't help but feel she was pregnant before getting with me and she's is just playing games to see what I would do in the situation or something comparing me to her husband. Who knows but I'm completely over her, I would never take her back ever again, but it's not something I'm going to try to forget, I have to keep in contact with her at least and she how she's doing incase it is my daughter. She doesn't have my address, only my phone number and myspace page. I'm working on getting a job and building some savings incase I need to be the one to support the baby. I wish I could talk to her mom and see what's really going on. She did have her period while I was with her but only one and I've heard you can still have one more even if you are pregnant so again who knows. I hope like hell it's not my daughter. And for the person who said stop going girl to girl living with them... These were the only 2 girls i've ever actually lived with. I call her succubus now. The other girl is now engaged to some other guy and says I'm not the only one who got another girl pregnant, even though we broke up first lol. I think I'll use the answer of not worrying about it until the baby girl is a couple years. You're all right I need to get my life together and worry about myself more than what she's doing since it's all beyond my reach. Thanks for the feedback.|`|u7LSohRyaa	Personally, I would cut her off. If this kid is yours, that's really sad. You might not get to meet her until she's grown. If she can't find you, she can't soak you for more money! She can't yank on your chain anymore. I would change my telephone number, my address, and maybe even my name. You're right. She's not human but a really nice VAMPIRE!@ Resist or she'll bleed you dry and drive you nuts.
wKuQC4yTaa	The pill is suppose to be started on the Sunday after your period. You just messed up your cycle. That's all. After taking BC for a couple months your cycle will regulate.|`|sYuG1Yj7aa	Yes, it's pretty common for you to miss a period actually. Also another thing that can affect whether or not you get your period is if you're working out more than usual. A high amount of physical activity can cause you to miss it. I miss mine pretty often just because of training for BMX racing.|`|791NVofcaa	Yes. New birth control can cause irregular cycles. However, you could still be pregnant since you had unprotected sex. Your best bet would be to take a home pregnancy test. If it's negative, you can probably blame the birth control. Good luck!
TpxtE1v0aa	I have heard of people getting pregnant with out having actual intercourse, but I think that the sperm still has to be wet.  That might require some more research or you could just speak to planned parenthood, they are free.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If his hand didn't have any semen on it you can't get pregnant. If his hand did and he touched your vagina there is a SMALL chance you can get pregnant, but really the sperm has to be IN your vagina to get pregnant.|`|596N0bRXaa	no because the sperm would die after 4secs.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Probably not, but it's barely possible if his hand is still wet.|`|Ohn3E3peaa	If you're worried just take a test, but it's possible it does.|`|XLsnuAqmaa	no|`|eHX8E3Rhaa	no sperms dies once it hits oxygen n is not in direct contact with the vagina|`|FPX6AcjFaa	In that case, it would be very improbable for you to get pregnant because the chances of sperm getting to an egg are highly unlikely. However, try to be more careful when you play around because there are always exceptions.<br>  <br>  Just in case--although I don't think you need it--there's a pill called Plan B. It's for women who've had unprotected sex or something and they're worried about pregnancy. It basically reduces by a lot the chance of anything unwanted happening. Look it up if you want so you can learn more, but I don't think it's necessary in this case. And it always just better to use condoms or a mix of protections.<br>  <br>  ;)|`|91jTS7Epaa	There is a chance, but there are so many factors to becoming pregnant (your own fertility, where you are in the cycle, his fertility, and then just pure chance).  There is no way to know until you're next period is due.  Until then, and even after, any kind of sex should be a sign that you are fully ready to be a parent.  If you're not, whether because that isn't the guy you want to be with for life, because you can't support a child, because you aren't ready for a child... should mean that you're not having sex.|`|hNIof0lbaa	Most likely NO! ...the sperm live for a long while if there IN you, otherwise they die on the outside. So, depending if he really went...in & if his hand was very very wet still, theres a chance, but from what your saying - I dont think your pregnant!!|`|fMzl8d4Zaa	it is possible.<br>  sperm could drip into a girls vagina and if they are ovulating then yes it is possible that she could get pregnant.<br>  you should probably be careful if you dont want to.|`|xWyXbsw6aa	i don't think so, it is pretty hard for his little swimmers to just get to the egg through sex, so if its just touching your clitoris then they don't have a chance - you should be fine.. :)|`|olyKkxHYaa	him just touching you doesnt make you pregnant..<br>  tha sperm actually has to reach your egg and implant in it..<br>  <br>  your probly not.<br>  dont worry.|`|CULqCWvXaa	there is a slight possibility but i seriously dought it.|`|b7Z3OSRwaa	possibly|`|2NZE7Vpnaa	that has happen to me before, and i suggetst u take a plan B pill to be safe. <br>  I mean its better to take it, instead of taking a risk.<br>  thats IF you dont want to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  on the other hand, if his hand wasn't wet, i dont think you can get pregnant.<br>  Sperm dies out quick......<br>  <br>  still, Take a Plan B pill.|`|anibDCRXaa	OK RELAX PLEASE!! lol<br>  umm just know that if sperm whether on his penis or hand touches the inside of your v-jj well you might get preggers if he just touched you outside like not inside well then don't trip about it.|`|mxTWbpzzaa	Okay sadly no one can answer this question but time and a prenancy test.

c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	Where are your hCG levels? Does your RE think it is in normal range? If not, it is possible that there was a vanishing twin for a number to be off. There are a lot of women who have not seen the baby and went for a later scan that confirmed it was a viable pregnancy. You can find their stories here. <a href="http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/mycommunity/viewtopic.php?t=11318&sid=c20ca851f71507c305991ccec216bcdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.misdiagnosedmiscarriage.com/m...</a><br>  <br>  I got pregnant via IVF and went for a scan when I was close to 6 weeks. The RE who did my scan saw nothing. No yolk sac, no heartbeat, no baby and said that I would miscarry. I went to see my regular RE the following day and we saw my peanut right where it should be. A different RE and a different ultrasound machine make a big difference! Plus I have a tilted uterus. If you have a tilted uterus it can make it harder to see. Though things were progressing normally for me, I ended up having a rare missed miscarriage much later. <br>  <br>  It is common to bleed during pregnancy. Plus MANY women bleed on the progesterone suppositories. I know it is scary but it does happen. If the bleeding continues you can switch to the injections. Cramping is normal too. Just about everyone I know has cramping and feel like their period is coming in early pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I'll say a prayer that you see your peanut tomorrow. Sending positive thoughts!|`|Hu9yquP4aa	All I can say is i am sorry. <br>  <br>  Molar pregnancies are tough. <br>  My sister had 2 and cannot conceive.

Anyways, she should tell her parents.  Then either try and figure by how far along you are who the dad is or when the baby is born get a paternity test or put it up for adoption.

tx8OTfFUaa	It's so funny that you post this today.  My son has just started in the last week to act the same way.  He is 9 months old.  Question:  does your daughter have any teeth or is she teething? Maybe her first is coming down or another one is coming in?  My son is working on his 6th tooth.  He handled all the rest great, but this one seems to be giving him some trouble.  <br>  <br>  Once I pick him up, he is fine.  I have been good about alone play time as well.  He acts fine for my husband, his daycare provider and everyone else, but as soon as mommy is in view, he starts in with the whining...ARGH!!  <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like she needs to learn to sooth herself so that when she wakes up, she knows how to put herself back to sleep.  It may be difficult, but you might need to do a little more "cry it out" with her.  Do you rock her totally asleep?  The next time she is asleep and you put her down and her head pops right back up, let her cry.   See how long it takes her to sooth herself to sleep...(only do this if you are sure there is nothing wrong with her like pain or stomach ache, etc..)<br>  <br>  Good luck!  As long as she sleeps at night, eats at least 24-36 ounces of formula or breastmilk (less if breastmilk) and is eating her fruits and veggies, she is fine!|`|7SkJN1f6aa	Im not expert at baby's or anything.<br>  But If my memory serves me correctly.<br>  This is perfectly normal.<br>  They're at a really clingy age, i they're 8months old. and this will continue for a while.<br>  Of course it will calm down.

Disney is one of the few places there actually might be rides you can go on since it's for a younger age group and the rides aren't very big.  Make sure you drink lot's and lot's of water since your going to be walking around all day don't want to get dehydrated.|`|AA10214265	Any of the thrill rides like coasters or motion simulators should probably be avoided.

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	Honestly, it doesnt sound like anything is wrong with you at all. Urine tests arent always accurate especially if you are testing BEFORE your period is due. There has to be enough HCG in your urine before the test will show positive. Some women have to be a week late before their test will show positive. You could be one of those. Some of the home pregnancy tests that you buy at a pharmacy are more accurate then the ones at the doctors office. A blood test is the most accurate at find out if you are pregnant. <br>  Also I wanted to mention that while the pull out method can be a joke for some, it can really work for others. If you do it properly, chances are you wont get pregnant. <br>  Perhaps its time for you and your husband to have a talk about whether or not to have children. It seems you very much want one, but have not said the words? I could be wrong. <br>  It sounds like youre a very healthy woman, and I doubt that youll have issues getting pregnant when the time is right. Good luck with everything.|`|963a60ad2fe21d7cef6dc7185c595623aa	The pull out method is a pretty unreliable method, but it does sometimes work.  Unless you are actually trying to get pregnant, I wouldn't assume there is something wrong.|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Wow.<br>  Poor thing!<br>  Would you like to conceive?<br>  Perhaps the pull out method isn't working in making you pregnant...get a blood test to see what your hormone levels are like.|`|ocwIcfzPaa	You aren't even trying to conceive. When you have been trying for 4 or 5 years, that's the time to worry.
AA10693194	she is probably not pregnant anyway just because you only entered then removed. dont worry you are most likely safe|`|LDPabWk0aa	i don't think shes pregnant the plan b really works i have try it alot and is  always a good thing so don't worried.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Sometimes Plan B can alter a woman's cycle temporarily causing her period to be late/early or lighter than normal. It will go back to normal though, usually that only happens for the first cycle after it is taken.
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Happy Birthday to you<br>  Happy Birthday to you<br>  Happy Birthday to Birthday<br>  Happy Birthday to you<br>  <br>  Nah, I'd reconsider|`|a34e6b0d3635b089c5a7917078fe691eaa	I don't think so, try something else|`|4arkYkbBaa	it is pretty cool!|`|15qceXaOaa	u r crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... what kind of parent would give their kid such a dreadful name?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? do ur kid a favor and give them a good normal name not some name that every kid at school will make fun of|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	No...|`|z0ro3VkJaa	Dear God in heaven...<br>  <br>  NO|`|WQdhfVvQaa	I don't think that wouldn't be a very good name for a kid. It IS their birthday so it wouldn't be very appropriate for the child's name to BE birthday. To me it seems to be kind of mean to name your child something weird, or a commonly used word. For example, Tuesday. The child might come to resent it or get made fun on. This is just my opinion.
AA11783671	Yes you are ovulating now!  That was the number one sign my midwife said to check for when we were planning our kids and we conceived both times within 2 months of trying.  Hope you get lucky tonight!<br>  By the way.... the date thing didn't really correspond with the discharge for me.  My cycles were always right on the money, but the "supposed to be ovulating days" were not right with the sticky discharge symptoms.
vGxipYJnaa	Tell her that you're sensitive to her condition - but she still needs to pull her weight around the house. Being pregnant isn't a disability. Plenty of women go to work, take classes, take care of their other children etc while pregnant and do just fine. Or, you could tell her that if she isn't going to do it then her boyfriend has to. That way it will get done regardless.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Well, her hormones are all crazy. So expect her to be all emotional and irritable. Just sit down with her and say that you know she's pregnant, and that you know she's irritable, but that still doesn't give her the excuse to not help around the house.  Just as long as you guys aren't expecting her to do anything like climbing down a huge flight of stairs holding a big bag of garbage, then I don't see why she wouldn't want to help. Good luck|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	Your friend is pregnant...She's probably sick and moody and annoyed at life in general (we are ALL that way at some point in pregnancy), but that shouldn't give her any green light to walk all over her room mates. Just try to be as nice and patient as possible. Maybe have a house meeting on how you could redivide the house chores?|`|lc57ntoFaa	Yeah it does seem pretty easy. Keep in mind us pregnant ladies are hormonal, and yeah. However in her defense, I know bending over and being on my feet a lot is uncomfortable, and tends to hurt my back... I am also 38 weeks, and have a huge kid. Sit down and talk to her. Maybe ask her what chore or what she'd like to do around the house to help out. Give her an option. That might help. Good luck!|`|NVVTTwm4aa	she is having mood swings. just explain to her that she have to do her part and being pregnant does mean you are an handicap|`|kvYgopThaa	Lol Why do you live with so many people?
sxecXFgraa	If she's having sex, with or without protection, there's a chance she can get pregnant, unless her ovaries have been removed.  Even if she goes to the doctor and he/she tells her she can't, that is still no guarantee that she will not get pregnant.|`|AA10494763	perfectly healthy normal people can  actively try for a year and not get pregnant and someone can have a condom break  once and get pregnant. The body is a weird thing. My wife and i tried for two months sex everyday almost before we got pregnant and that was quick by medical standards. I think she  will be fine|`|hErzvFReaa	Just because she didn't get pregnant the two times she had unprotected sex, doesn't mean she can't produce children.  She is obviously very uneducated because most people know that it can take months for a woman to finally get pregnant.  A women's body fights off sperm when it first enters, which is why it is so difficult to get pregnant.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	she just got lucky. if you have unprotected sex it doesn't guarantee you get pregnant. some people go for months of having unprotected sex and don't get pregnant. If she is really concerned then she should go to a fertility specialist and they'll tell her.|`|QoenvlFuaa	That in itself is not a valid reason to think she can't have children. She could go see a doctor if she wanted to know for sure (I think they can check that sort of thing). My guess is she just wasn't ovulating at the time.|`|9yJdY4s0aa	Yes, she can probably still get pregnant.  I mean, is she 50 or something??|`|ZcfZx60aaa	It sound like your gf doesn't want to have kids...or she's not telling you the whole story.<br>  <br>  From what you said, there is nothing indicating that she can't get pregnant. Sometimes it takes months and months to get pregnant. Regarding ovulation, it usually day 14 of a 28 day cycle. Day 1 is the first day of bleeding. If you are trying to get pregnant have sex the day before and after your gf ovulates.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|IRFbj0G9aa	DO YOU KNOW THAT EVERY TIME SHE OVULATES THERE IS A 25% CHANCE SHE COULD GET PREGNANT.  REALLY WHO CAN KNOW FOR SURE.  TILL SHE ACTUALLY MAKES AN EFFORT AND PAYS ATTENTION TO HER FERTILE DAYS, AND TRIES FOR QUITE A WHILE DELIBERATELY TO CONCEIVE FOR A YEAR AT LEAST IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY,  ONLY THEN CAN YOU BEGIN TO SUSPECT FERTILITY ISSUES.  HATE TO TELL YA THIS, BUT YOU SEEM MORE INFORMED THAN YOUR FIANCEE.  AND AT THE END OF THE DAY NO MATTER WHAT WE ALL MAY SAY HERE, IF YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW, AND FOR SOME REASON IT IS A DETERMINING FACTOR IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP GO FIND OUT!  GO GET TESTED.|`|zrknbZNGaa	Seriously? A healthy woman only has about 60% chance of getting pregnant. It just didn't happen for her those two times, it doesn't mean she can't get pregnant ever...<br>  <br>  As a side note, is your fiance by any chance blonde?|`|p4edQD9Vaa	yeah that's called luck! a healthy woman only has a 60% chance of getting pregnant any given month. Tell her that she shouldn't be having unprotected sex just because she got lucky twice.
LEAx00NEaa	yeah i agree wit u it's wrong 2 kill a baby period|`|bxlYleZkaa	Under certain circumstances I have to say yes, I do believe in a woman's right to have an abortion.|`|xOr67VDiaa	I dont believe in anything that harms innocent children. but i dont believe in bringing innocent children into the world that are going to suffer just because some dumbass decided they were tough or cool because they had unprotected sex with there so called bf and fell pregnant.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I would never do it,ever,and I don't agree with it,but it is the mom's right,and I'm not going to judge someone based on that. Adoption is a way better option than abortion,but again,that's the mom's choice. Some people just aren't able to care for a child. I wouldn't hate on someone that made that decision,and in some cases,it would be the best decision (either one)|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Questions like these should be deleted whenever asked. <br>  Here's my stock answer.....Abortion is nobody's business but those involved in the pregnancy.  It is not an easy decision to make and nobody chooses it without a good reason.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	No, I don't believe in abortion... but that's just me. However, I would never judge someone who is thinking of having one, or someone who has already had one. For some people that's the best option.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I believe this shouldnt be asked on here. your trying to start a rant..|`|kyqhMuSiaa	I personally don't believe in abortion. There are plenty of couples unable to have children that would adopt. However never having been in the situation of having to make that decision I can't say. I mean there are circumstances where I might very well consider it like being pregnant as a result of a rape.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	I believe I follow the commandment thou shall not judge<br>  <br>  Also, I don't see what is wrong with giving a baby up for adoption.  If it is between abortion or adoption of course adoption is a far better choice.  How can you be against adoption?|`|EY0wnkh3aa	I feel the same way as you. Having an abortion is just wrong in so many ways, and though I don't like the idea of putting a baby up for adoption... it's better than killing your baby. I mean how can you have the heart to kill your own child or just give it away?|`|kT7GVOosaa	I agree. if you consider yourself old enough and mature enough to have sex then you must consider yourself old and mature enough to be a parent.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	I wouldnt get one but i believe that a woman has a right to abort and I believe it is none of mine or anybody elses business if she does.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	what i believe dont matter<br>  <br>  girls do what they want and my opinion does not influence at all...<br>  <br>  <br>  i wouldnt have an abortion|`|Adq6y8tXaa	i agree that abortion is wrong! but i think adoption it okay|`|IogJBs2Naa	I am for a person's choice to have one.  but personally  I don't think I  could ever have one.|`|AUagSXp0aa	I believe that there are plenty of people out there who try and can't have kids,but the women who don't have the mentality or the means to care for children have 14!(octo-mom)This is where the women who have abortions should of thought hard about their actions. It not only is selfish but a really poor means of contraceptive. Even if a woman was a victim of rape it still isn't ok.|`|Iuzmk84Gaa	There are a million opinions on this subject.<br>  I am pro-choice. I DO NOT believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control! But on the other hand, who am I to tell a young woman who was impregnated during a rape that she can't have an abortion? There are too many different scenarios to give a strict yes or no answer.|`|3fV6zRlJaa	I dont know if I personally could ever go thru with it, but for others I recommend it. Some ppl in this world were just not cut out to have children!!  Kids now days just have sex bc they are curious and they dont know the consequences and the baby shouldnt be punished bc the parents are to young and dumb to care for them. Therefore I am not against abortion, no.|`|CNZn1qhJaa	Hell yeah.<br>  <br>  When you abort the fetus, it's not even a human yet. It literally is not a human, I don't care what people say. If someone thinks that bringing the fetus (baby, whatever) into the world would not be beneficial to the baby or anyone else, then yeah, it's abortion time.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	i think you should keep your opinion to yourself instead of trying to cause an uproar. what someone else decides to do with her body, her baby, her life is none of your business! its not going to affect you so you shouldn't have a say in it! there is more to it than just 'responsibility'!|`|0GqYeMVWaa	when a woman has been violently raped by a disease infested man,who may have hiv and god knows what else.should she really be forced into having a child when she didnt consent and didnt even know the man? its never cut and dry and none of us should feel that our opinion is right over another persons.yes,i am sick of paying for taxes just to support selfish little madams who think its their god given right to breed and dump the kids on the welfare system.its not either.but its my opinion.you opened a can of worms with this question.x|`|lrJopeC5aa	I believe in pro choice, that if a women wants to get rid of the fetus she can choose to get rid of it because she is in control of her body own body. Of course there are other reasons but I am afraid I don't have the time to explain.|`|JNywvlXEaa	Abortion is basically murder...the heart starts beating at 18 days<br>  And putting up for adoption could lead to the child ending up in an abusive family.<br>  So as you said, if u get preggers take responsibility for it.|`|VoiRASobaa	I think that the woman should actively choose whether or not to have an abortion, but I do highly favor choosing to have the baby. Still, It's the mother's choice.|`|GEZezIS7aa	People need to take responsibility for their actions- not kill their babies when they realize they're pregnant. This can be a very touchy issue,however; I believe that God is the only one who should decide between life and death.|`|c3769181e7971d485d922d43f71276cbaa	Personally I wouldn't have. I don't think I would be able to cope with that sort of decision. But I think that is something the mom should decide for herself. For some it's the best option.|`|OF7ZHq19aa	It depends what if it is necesary|`|m00YTcjNaa	no people should take responsibility for their actions|`|rQ1focfZaa	no i hate it....and i think its very wrong

BwGyVnB1aa	Sounds like you are! Your moms right, get a blood test an you'll find out forsure. Good luck. :]|`|kaqPSgTVaa	That could mean you are pregnant but it may not...Listen to your mom and see your doctor.
TGUoZF63aa	It all depends on what you're looking for! Together, you should decide how you want to name your kids. If you prefer more traditional, common names, then Alyssa Rose Turner is beautiful. However, if you prefer names that aren't as heard of, Audrey Rose Turner is just as nice :) they are both gorgeous names, but it's up to you to decide how you want your children to be named.<br>  <br>  Also, if you love both, wait until she is born. My teacher had a baby and her entire pregnancy planned on naming her Amelia Rose but when she was born, she knew that she didn't feel like an Amelia and she is now Norynn Rose. Maybe you should keep both and then decide which one you think your baby girl is! <br>  <br>  If it were up to me, I would choose Audrey Rose Turner.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I love Alyssa! I had a sister named Alyssa who passed away as a baby and I wish that Alyssa was my name! I love the nicknames Lyssie and Lyss!<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|BX4Ja1Rgaa	Alyssa Rose definitely it sounds fo much more glamourous|`|dVJOF4Bhaa	Alyssa Rose is nicer.|`|h8mWBh34aa	Audrey Rose Turner|`|MMj7YcXkaa	alyssa rose!  sounds wonderful|`|OLl5Zc6baa	audrey|`|Vi5SCyr9aa	audrey!|`|KAj7GfeDaa	Alyssa Rose- for sure!

Also, Alyssa is kind of soft so it goes perfect with Rose.|`|BxpGdVTOaa	Both are lovely. I like Alyssa Rose Turner the best for over all sound, but I love the name Audrey over Alyssa generally. <br>  Congratulations, :)|`|7F0zA7ARaa	Alyssa.|`|EvgSMTjnaa	Personally I much prefer Audrey. Beautiful name.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	Audrey Rose Turner is sooooo cute !

When you are ready, do tell your parents but don't wait too long.  When you tell your parents, if you feel better, i think you should bring a friend that you trust with you or at least the father of the baby.  Your parents are most likely to yell at you and be mad at you for a very long time, but just remember that if you do decide to keep the baby, then your parents will most likely come around to help and give you the support that they think you need as a new parent.  Even though you are so young and many people may look at you being pregnant at this age is bad, it can always be a positive thing because you're bringing a precious new life into the world.  Try not to stress out about it that much because it's bad for you and the baby.  I hope all goes well|`|zRgPoJtraa	Talk to someone you trust let all your wories out that will help you feel much better. Been pregnant isnt the end of the world i had a baby at 16 and im going to college next year. Dont have an abortion a baby is a precious thing and when i became a mum i just knew abortion was wrong even if you dont want a baby have it and give it for adoption theres people out who are desperate for a child but cant have one. Tell your parents and the babys dad and make a decission with them. You need to know it wont be easy having a child if you decide to keep it you have to put the babies needs first and what you want isnt 1st on the list anymore. But been a mum is the most wonderful sensation in the world and youll never regret having a baby.<br>  Stay strong and be happy make the most of the situation <br>  Good luck|`|YIMmjBn3aa	Your life is not over. I love how people on here are so judgemental but when it comes time for them to be judged they get pissed. First off all, abortion is wrong. You layed down and opeded your legs and I think you should take on the responsibilty of that child. With the help of your parents. Abortion is the easy way out. Hello? Adoption if you dont want to keep that baby. And whomever says you cant make it they are lying to you. My friend was 13 when she got pregnant and guess what? she grad top in her class, valedictorian, and is attending college right now to become a RN. I was 17 when I got pregnant and I am bout to grad high school and begin college in the fall. So my life must be over too right? to all those people that think it is.

If an abortion is what you need then do it. If not adoption too. But if your willing to become a young women and take of your child then go for it.

ZQyAlNhjaa	There are certain old names that are coming back in style. For example, if you look on the most popular baby names list on babynames.com, you will see that Lillian is number 72 and Lily is number 7. I will agree that Martha has gone out of style but other older names on this list include:<br>  <br>  1. Ava (Even though it's number 1 now, it's actually an old name.)<br>  5. Abigail (Always makes me think of revolutionary time, but it's #5)<br>  42. Sara (This name has been around since biblical times)<br>  87. Alice (Pretty old-fashioned.)<br>  88. Ruby (Becoming more popular, but was popular a while ago)<br>  100. Evelyn (Kind of an old lady name, but it made the list!)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	I love old names.  Names that seem old only seem that way because they were the trendy names of a longer ago time period so they're dated.  In 80 years when all the Madisons and Kaylees are old ladies, those will seem like old names.  Names also tend to go through cycles, and a lot of "old" names are starting to gain popularity again.  That trend is mostly in Britain so far, but it's starting to make its way to the US and will soon enough.|`|f3nGD71laa	Names can be considered "too old." For example, people repulse at the thought of a baby girl being named "Bertha" or "Fannie", "Margaret" may be considered old too. I do not think Lilian is too old. It is a cute name, and I know several people with that name. Plus, the child could go by Lilly, which is a very cute girls name as well.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.<br>  :)|`|QtIpuKM3aa	Lilian is very pretty, But like Martha or Bernice, Bertha, Jane and Joan Debbie omg those just seem anciant to me, I hate my name it is to common so when I named my kids their names where not very common, But now you hear my boys names often but not my daughters|`|md9rI5Y6aa	I don't think Lilian is old, but my help-me-grow reps name is eugena and the first thought that came to my head was "you don't hear that too much anymore"|`|bHI4NLonaa	lilian is beautiful. there are some names that are too old in my opinion, like agnes and ethel and hazel. But, then again, some people really like those names today. So, who cares what other people think? Name your baby what you like.|`|QWOWqGq2aa	yes they can ; especially when everyone has it !!|`|bApqdmC0aa	ccchhyeah. like elenora, mary or rose|`|vKKVqnWvaa	my grandma's name is ruth adn her sisters name was naomi...someday when i have a baby girl, i want to name her after my grandma because i am such a grandma's girl|`|vGxipYJnaa	Names go in and out of fashion. We've seen a recent rise in names like Grace, Lillian, and Evelyn.. but not others like Mildred, Hortense and Beulah. It really just depends what's back in style - but feel free to name your child something very old-fashioned, of course. It's up to you! Our daughters are Leona and Adele - which are both pretty "old" names.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	When I was pregnant with my son (thank goodness he was a boy!) my great-Aunt Esther wanted me to have twin girls and name them (no joke!) Esther Agnes and Alice Gertrude.  She was serious!  I was horrified!  My son's name is Jared Lee.  Lilian is not too old of a name.  Lilly is a good nickname.  There is nothing wrong with naming a child an older type name, if you are honoring a family member.  For example, my husband's son (by a previous marriage) is named Brent Melvin ... Melvin being for his father who has passed away.  They never use the name Melvin ... but "Poppy" called the boy "Little Mel" for a long time!|`|bge945ytaa	Some names just give off an old connotation because they were popular around our grandparents age, or even later.<br>  <br>  No, Lilian is not an "old" name because it is kind of trendy right now.<br>  <br>  Some names I consider to be old"<br>  Ethel<br>  Martha<br>  Jane<br>  Gladys<br>  Mary<br>  Elizabeth<br>  Eliza<br>  Beth<br>  Prudence<br>  Agnus<br>  Mildred|`|5edYekPjaa	In my opinion,  if you use OLD FASHIONED TRENDY NAMES, these could be considered in a few time very ugly names !!. Don't use old fashioned names !! Better use classical !!|`|mZi7R0Enaa	There are some older names like Bertha, Gertrude etc that will probably not be seen anymore but a name like Martha is lovely and timeless!|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I don't think a name is ever old - I mean, it's a name, not a sentient being - but there are certainly names that were a lot more popular in dayg gone by then they are now, which leads to lots of old people having those names, which leads to those names being associated with older people. Martha, Gladys, Pearl, and Mabel are all such names.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I love the name Lilian and don't think it's 2 old...as long as you call her Lili for short. And I don't think Martha is too short...as long as you call her Martie. There are a lot of names that are too old...but you can give themm nick names to make themm seem new. My favorite old name is Anita...she could go by Annie.<br>  <br>  Others:<br>  Earleen<br>  Barnabus|`|dd50eb473ebc0cb99b3755dc119d61f2aa	Unbelievebly "Strongetharm" used to be a popular name in Britain until several hundred years ago.   Now that's what I consider old fashioned!|`|nZVmkZSBaa	George<br>  Mary<br>  Sue<br>  Elizabeth<br>  Lewis<br>  Ronald<br>  Abraham<br>  Victor<br>  Martha<br>  Lynn<br>  Yolanda<br>  Jared<br>  Jed<br>  Lium<br>  Faith<br>  Diamond<br>  Martin<br>  Joseph<br>  Julius<br>  Wyatt<br>  Richard<br>  Ricardo<br>  Ann<br>  Anna<br>  Anya<br>  Donna<br>  Eli<br>  Pamela<br>  Luisa<br>  Jane<br>  Particia<br>  Poppy<br>  Lacy<br>  Lauren<br>  Don<br>  Dawn<br>  Robinette<br>  Antoinette<br>  Genevieve<br>  Harry<br>  Claire|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Louise<br>  Frances<br>  Betty<br>  Leonard<br>  Fred<br>  Ralph<br>  All are from the 40's era.  You want old names?  Look at the Bible.  Those babies you can't even pronounce.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i dont think names are too old, i just think it is because people don't use them any more. like the name Marion, Darlene, Gretchen, Gertrude.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Lillian is DEFINITELY NOT too old! In fact, "old lady chic" names like Hazel & Audrey are making a come back.<br>  <br>  Something that's "too old" would be something like Gertrude or Imogen. ;)|`|QmWzBERjaa	I'm 15. I know a Lillian my age. You could always call her Lily. I'm not pregnant or even close but I love names too.
nfzQkvqraa	You're on it.|`|kSZx9cY5aa	Designer clothes-my husband says my daughter and I are the two people solely keeping the retail industry running in this crappy economy hahaha. <br>  I can't help it, I go in a store just to 'look' and end up drooling over a pair of shoes, and in my twisted logic buy them because "they'll go perfectly with that skirt over there...but if I but the skirt then I NEED to get that jacket...I guess I'll buy all three!!". <br>  And the last 4 weeks i've basically worn nothing but sweat pants and p.js...don't ya just hate post-baby weight?<br>  <br>  Also Carmex! I have it on now, and it's sitting next to me so I won't have to get up when I need more. Best lip balm ever, I have about 12 of them so I can have them in my bag, a few in my bedroom, the kitchen,  the bathroom, my pocket...I even made my husband stop during sex once because I NEEDED to put Carmex on. Yep, I'm a Carmex wh*re. <br>  <br>  Aren't you jittery from all the coke?? I think I would be bouncing off the walls haha :)<br>  <br>  **TigerLily that is a good one! I know what you mean, I have a really bad habit of not wearing a helmet while i'm riding, but i'm super anal about making my kids wear them. I'll jump on a 17.1h TB that i've never ridden, helmet-less and take off, but would die of fear if my kids even thought about it lol!|`|AA10032971	I love Pepsi Cola and want it with my meals. My favorite of all time would have to be boiled peanuts. I usually order them by the case of 24. They are worth every cent invested. An added point here is that they have been proven to best fight Cancer. Although nuts of any kind are helpful in defeating this disease, the boiled peanuts are considered the best. I was happy to hear that fact. Peace!|`|7aCH91ISaa	Y/A and stupid so called reality shows. I record wife swap because I like to watch it after all the chores are done and I can relax and be proud of how *normal* I am compared to some of those people. I also LOVE Rock of Love. Again, another show that makes me feel superior :-)|`|YL1evGq3aa	My addiction is television. While I'm doing my homework I have to have the noise of the tv on. I can't focus on anything without the tv on. I can't seem to stop it.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	General Hospital.  I tivo it so I don't have to watch the annoying commercials.

I'm thinking, "Couldn't you have asked me when I was up?" I swear it's like my husband, kids and cat (yes him too) all conspire against me so I won't rest or actually eat.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Oh mine does all the time and that seems to be the time that i remember I was supposed to do something that day.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	yes there are times i stay up for hours and can not sleep due to thinking about every thing. i usually drink a cup of tea and it helps?|`|UKPYoPKuaa	Yes I have an over active mind, getting no sleep ruins the next day for me, I just can't shut down easy.. especially when lying in the dark. I have some tricks I've learnt to deal with this over the years but I still have trouble.<br>  <br>  - Turn off the tv & net an hr or so before hitting the sheets.<br>  - Make sure your actually tired, re-arrange your sleep pattern - Wake up early, go to bed early around the same time each day.<br>  -When your laying in bed clear your mind & take a few breaths, tell your mind that you can think of anything other than responsability's. You will start to day-dream eventually turning into an actual dream : )|`|5p7gpj36aa	Mine races all day, and then takes a break at bedtime!  I fall asleep right away at around 10:30, yesterday at 9:30!  BUT.. then somehow in my dreams my mind thinks about everything I am worried about and wakes me up so that I can't go back to sleep!  So I am usually up way before the alarm.  I'd rather have it this way though, than not being able to go to sleep.  That happened before and I took sleeping pills for a week at bedtime to get me back on schedule.  I couldn't take not falling asleep at night!|`|nfzQkvqraa	Yes.  It's the worst.  Unless I have a beer or a glass of wine or something. (ooooh does that make me a bad parent??!)<br>  <br>  My mind is always turned on even when my body is exhausted.  And I always have the feeling I'm forgetting something.  Every time I'm trying to fall asleep without fail I feel like I forgot to do something.<br>  <br>  Thanks!|`|dgRTkccBaa	Yes!  I have to think about things that don't relate to my life like tv shows or movies because it's the only way I can go to sleep.

It seems to get it all clarified in my head, almost like i'm explaining to someone what needs doing. try doing that before you go to sleep at night .<br>  bets of luck x|`|XhirXRkpaa	I am not a parent, but my mind races just the same.  I work all day, and I never seem to get enough done.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Every night.  It's so irritating too!  Mostly my mind races with the flashbacks of the molestation I suffered as a child (I just started counseling to deal with it and it's causing a lot of feelings to become un-rooted).<br>  <br>  But yes thoughts of "Are the kids alright?..... Did I let the dog out?......Did I pack the diaper bag before I went to bed so I don't run out of diapers while running errands tomorrow? ...... Did I remember to set the timer on the coffee pot???"  It's a never ending cycle! LOL.  You aren't the only one.<br>  <br>  Meditating could be a good idea.  Or you could try Ambien :)  Actually I am starting to do Yoga before bed and it's helping me calm my mind.  You might try that.<br>  <br>  *ETA*<br>  Jen, if having a glass of wine or a beer before bed makes you a bad parent, I'm just as bad as you are!  I enjoy a glass of wine every so often when I need to de-stress.|`|AkFag8tNaa	It used to! I used to stay awake for hours when we were not financially stable.

(well less tired then writing with a pen), but if you don't want to do it online i used to hide mine under the floor boards in my attic, or you might even consider hiding it somewhere secretive in HER room, she'll never think about looking there :] Just make sure it's somewhere she never touches (like a dusty shelf of old stuffed animals) good luck sweetie.|`|hkUzSsRZaa	Hide it somewhere where she won't find it! I would take it to school with me everyday and keep it in my locker (if you have a locker) tell your parents if she doesn't stop. Put it in an old shoe box or behind a drawer.

sDwN4XuIaa	More than likely its jsut spotting, but you might want to keep an eye on it.  If they told you, that you may have spotting then you should be fine.  I think usually implantation bleeding happens a couple days after the act, it takes a little bit for mister sperm to break through that hard shell...  I wouldnt be to concerned at this point sweety.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	i think from what you have said theres probably a 0.1 % chance you could be pregnant. its probably the implantation that is causing spotting and also your breast feeding. if you dont want to use condoms i would use the pull out method along with the thing in your arm you wont get pregnant.|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Implantation bleeding/spotting doesn't occur until the fertilised egg has made it's way down the fallopian tube to the uterus which it then embeds itself into the wall which in turn can result in implantation bleeding/spotting. Implantation usually happens between 6-10 days after ovulation. I don't think you are pregnant and yes it was definitely too early for implantation spotting but i suggest you wait until your implant covers you from an unwanted pregnancy before you have sex again.|`|WZQKevt8aa	It sounds like the implanon birth control you're on. Breastfeeding is not effective at stopping pregnancy, the only thing it does usually, is stop your period. The day after would be too soon for implantation bleeding, it would either be your implanon birth control or it may be because you're still tender 'down there' from birth. If you know when your period is due, take a pregnancy test just to make sure. But I seriously doubt you would be pregnant. Good luck!|`|R8qooymyaa	no you wouldnt get implantation bleeding a day later, i got implantation bleeding this evening and i ovulated on 17th. some people can get it from 3 days but its quite rare most times if women are going to get it, its from 10 days onwards, but as you know yourself alot of people dont get implantation bleeding. <br>  <br>  x|`|we9sS2tNaa	No. I promise you, you are NOT prego...Implantation bleeding doesn't happen for at least 1 week after conceiving and only like 20% of women get it. Your body is just trying to get back to normal and the spotting is from the baby you just had. Just start using birth control|`|4t4S5kLkaa	hey i think it is probably due to the implant i had this in and pretty much bled non stop little one day n quite a bit another so had it taken out, they do say that its effective as soon as its put in though :)

Fd4lITkvaa	At his age I wouldn't worry too much. My family isn't religious at all and we all went to religious preschools. It opened discussions at home about different religions and beliefs which I believe is healthy. I went to passover with some friends and vacation bible school with others though. I think learning that other people believe different things is good at any age, you just need to talk about it at home when it's time.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	I think your husband is right. Your baby won;t understand it right now. I would however tell her immediately and nicely that when it comes to religious beliefs that YOU will be the one influencing that belief. <br>  <br>  Maybe something like this, "I respect your beliefs but I would also like you to respect mine and not teach him creation science because this is not what our family believes in... again I respect your beliefs 100%"<br>  <br>  If she is not okay with that then you ned to find a new baby sitter.|`|pXSKSS3daa	You're being a worry wart and your husband is right.<br>  <br>  At 5 and a half months your baby is only noticing the bright colors on anything on television. No need in causing a scene about this now. When your baby gets to, say, 3-4 years in age then I would start thinking more about what they are watching.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I don't believe in creation science, either. I'm not against my daughter being exposed to the idea, but I plan on raising her with a belief in God. I'd probably say something, just express your concerns, but I probably wouldn't worry too much (especially if she's a good babysitter, which can be hard to find) I would say something though, just to make sure she knew where you stood on the situation. I do agree that your child is too young to grasp any concept when it comes to creation, but I understand your point.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	I would bring it up, maybe... ever so slightly, in a polite way, or ask to get more information about the movie. You never really know what it was about. He IS still pretty young, not much memory to really remember watching a movie at almost 6 months. It also depends on how long you plan on letting the woman watch your son. If its something pretty long term and might last up until he's at that impressionable age, yeah... I'd kindly say something about it or just ask. I would have asked about it anyway, just out of curiousity, haha. I'm nosy like that.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	Frankly if your child is staying with a women who is homeschooling, he will be exposed to whatever they are doing.  When you are watching a 5 month old they do what you do.  It is unreasonable to think that she will shield their daily life from him.  At 5 months old it doesn't matter, but even if he was 5 years old it would be justifiable.  <br>  <br>  If it is a huge deal to you, find somewhere else for him to stay.|`|sSRHQkROaa	um..i would talk about it now.<br>  things can influence a child that young and effect them when they are older. technically he won't remember, but what he's watching will be tucked and stored somewhere in his brain.<br>  <br>  you can talk to her with out insulting her, since she is a grown woman she should be able to understand where you are coming from and you two should be able to handle the situation in a respectable manner.|`|qW5PqMepaa	At this age all he would be interested in is watching the colours changing on the screen, and listening to sounds. He wouldn't be taking any of it in.|`|dX4Dll0yaa	Wait until he is older. He had no clue what was going on.|`|078c9269781f249b467d399b49c9e6b1aa	i wouldn't worry about it he is just a little baby and doesn't understand.|`|C4miEeuYaa	I think that you have every right to be concerned because that is your child and your beliefs. But she also has her own beliefs and reserves the right to show her children what she wants. (We all know that, I'm sure.) But what I think you should do is this: Let her know how you feel (respectively, obviously) and just ask her if she doesn't mind showing her kids that stuff when your baby is napping. I know a lot of people say that he is only 5 1/2 months, and babies aren't gonna remember what they watch. To that, I agree-but at the same time, I think that if it is on consistently, he will begin to pick up on things as he gets older. I really think you should just tell her how you feel and then ask her the favor. Good Luck! :)|`|AA11210211	I think you ae being a worry wart.At 5 1/2 months they have NO clue what they are watching.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	AT 5 1/2 months, I wouldn't worry about it.  Within the next, when you son gets older, perhaps talk to her about your beliefs and polity ask not to subject your son to those things.  I am sure she will respect your wishes, but at this point, I don't think its going to have any impression what so ever on your son.
CdJtH0xdaa	Yes, I think that most rappers are talentless. Keyword, MOST. There are some that I think are good. Of course, I don't really listen to rap, but the rappers I've heard before aren't too bad. =)|`|seJxUXHCaa	uhm -- na..<br>  your just stereotypinq them, just because they smoke don`t mean they're hiqh all tha time. so chilll.<br>  rap is qood, it's just not your type of music, kool, no need to make a biq deal about it. dam. and anyway, if they were talentless, why are they on the radio all dha time &+ why do people like them? hmm. bug off. some people don`t like your country shyt or whatever tha fuqk you listen to, we don`t make a biq deal about it or judqe you thouqh, do we? na. so just chill ya nuts. everyone has a different taste in music;|`|d4QeAlVsaa	No they do have talent, talking fast, of course is a talent.. i know many people who cant talk fast, so i find that a talent for sure.. <br>  But whatever everyone has their own opinions.|`|7SCjPftKaa	Old rappers- good.<br>  New 'rappers'- bad.<br>  <br>  Yeah...they got lazy.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	shut up. seriously. I dont listen to rap either but who do you think you are to say something like this. Rapper are some of the highest paid artist and get a lot of respect or what they do. Keep your biased opinions to yourself cause you sound like a moron.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	NO.<br>  <br>  I don't listen to rap, but I respect it. <br>  <br>  The ones worth respecting, anyway.|`|LTWlBSFNaa	i love rap!<br>  can u rap its harded than u think|`|vp1K0bxwaa	I agree with you.<br>  <br>  Rap is not music. It's degrading to women and talks about rape and drugs like its no big deal!|`|EctsgAOsaa	To diva:  How was this question racist in the slight bit? See here, white people rap, black people sing country. White people enjoy rap, black people enjoy country. Rap is not exclusive to the black community. Just look at Eminem (white man), he's one of the best selling rappers in the world. And look at Charley Pride (black man), one of the first and most talented country singers to date. Your comment, to me, seems rather ignorant and uncultured, and your stereotypes along with many other people's are part of the core of personal vendettas against colors of skin today. I don't know why you assumed this person listened to country, but I think probably because you presumed that that is what white people are into. Sorry if this came out very harsh (I know it did). You seem like a very sweet girl with good intentions, but with some wrong information in your head. :)<br>  <br>  Ok, now answering the question, I think rap can take a lot of talent, especially the writing portion. The ones that do not write about hoes and pimps and lame dance moves can have some very deep meanings into them, something raw that makes you feel in the moment.  While techno is the opposite, putting you in a dream state, which is what I honestly prefer, good rap lyrics with an articulate and pleasant voice and a sick rap beat (and the beats take a lot of time to make too if it is high quality) can arouse some really genuine feelings of passion, anger, sadness, etc. I guess good rap is more of a poem than a song, and some people are into full-blown music, which is understandable.<br>  <br>  And yes, many musicians of all genres are pretty high when recording. But I wouldn't suggest it! :)|`|90nnM99Paa	plenty of rappers have more talent and passion for their music then many other musicians<br>  I don't enjoy rap too much either, but when you get past the fact that they're talking really fast along to a beat, and listen to their words, it's their life story. they're really passionate about it, and I think you should be more open to it. or at least keep your opinion to yourself.|`|p3d3E75oaa	its a talent what talent do you have, and for some rappers its poetry|`|I64JOuMKaa	it takes talent to rap,<br>  you have to make sure that the words rhyme and that it makes sense and that it goes well with the beat.<br>  <br>  If people on the bus are playing it really loud<br>  put your earphones on and listen to some other "classical" music you might enjoy.<br>  <br>  no neeed to take out all your anger on rap<br>  but I do agree, some are nonsense but some are actually really good.|`|LbNXxRXnaa	I agree that most rappers have noooo talent at all! seriously, they're just talking.<br>  <br>  I actually do think Lil' Wayne is talented, but I don't listen to all of his music.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Diva, hun, that's not racist, it's an opinion. Just because people don't like rap doesn't mean they don't like it due too race. That is just immature to even think that.|`|F3iEnj2Caa	I think it depends on the rapper. I am not exactly into the whole entire rap thing but you cant make assumptions. Some rappers DO have talent. They are just rare.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	some are awful and have yucky sounding voices, like lil wayne. i really like flo-rida however.|`|4a4fc6fd359a16c13169b1185d22b8b7aa	No.. all musicians should have at least some kind of talent to make it in the music industry in the first place...|`|DkT8znckaa	I do not totally agree. Some of them (like Soulja Boy or Flo Rida - not only do they have stupid names, but they can't really rap) are just stupid and don't have talent. A lot of them can't rap about anything meaningful either (Like Plies, who only raps about sex and nothing else.... I don't even know who would have sex with him because he's ugly and gross) But some rappers do actually write their own rhymes that mean something. They actually take old songs and then "sample" them...... it is pre-made, but it isn't - the tune has already been made but some of them change it and run another beat over it. (It's still pathetic, though.) I think Kanye West is one of the better rappers. He can really write, and he also produces music, and that does take talent. He's crazy, but I think he really does have serious musical talent. (My friend's mom is a music teacher, and she agrees with that). Also, there are a lot of "underground" rappers who write their own raps that are really meaningful, and might even make their own beats (but not always) and they are talented, but their raps don't get played on the radio and they don't get signed because they aren't talking about what people think others want to hear.|`|CGBWxtAjaa	I think they dont sing well|`|mCoipTkbaa	depends on who it is...not all!|`|avwNUupMaa	I like all types of music, including rap, so I do find rappers talented. They are just like any other musician but they chose to display their talent in a different way.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try to listen to several different rap artists or songs, and not just whatever you are exposed to on T.V or on the bus. You might surprise yourself and start to enjoy rap.<br>  <br>  Even if you still dislike rap music, it's alright; everyone has a different taste.<br>  <br>  :)|`|0GqYeMVWaa	i think my horse has more talent than all the rappers put together.shes not that bright either.bless her.x|`|dbf8Afhoaa	I think most of the rappers these days are ridiculous because all they do is talk about how great they are, they disrespect women, and say thingst that don't even make sense. <br>  <br>  However, there ARE some rappers who talk about things worth making a song over. Listen to "I know I can" by Nas. It's a great song. :)|`|AA11296427	Fo' Shizzle!<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean, is that even English? They don't even sing, anyone can make a pretty poem (that is normaly about hoes anyway) and give it a melody (kind of!) and put a backing track on it!<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a singer and it really pisses me of that most of the Numer One's are disgraces like Soulja Boy and bloody Kanyé West *sigh*<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|ixy3memMaa	Ummm actually.. this is off topic. but rap is not music. Its Rhyming or poetry. Some have talent if they write their own songs. I do not like it and i don't listen to it. The closest thing i listen to rap is Hollywood Undead, and that's Rap/metal. So its all good in the hood ;)|`|puEjSoDfaa	No, I like rap, and a lot of singers and even authors and composers and writers for movies are high when they do these things, don't single out one group|`|6IXXbZ0xaa	you may think they are talentless but here's a link his name is canibus and he curses a little but he is wise <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SehFKIVXWis" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SehFKIVXW...</a><br>  <br>  listen to it once, you may change your mind|`|52E9NR2Waa	i don't think they are great singers...<br>  <br>  but i'm always amazed with their writing and their clever and crazy rhyming, it does take talent, just in a non-musical kind of way lol|`|EWFtQNSdaa	With the exception of Eminem (who raps about things other than women's ***'s)<br>  <br>  Yes I do think they are talentless.|`|AtTxzYXbaa	No. They are not talentless.<br>  <br>  Most musicians are high when they sing. If you don't like it, throw your music away.|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Your just not listening to the right rappers.|`|lS7Lj81zaa	Oh My Gosh, Yes! Finally someone feels the same as me. Rappers are totally talentless. It's like if you can talk really fast, you get a record deal. And they're insanely rich why? Being high isn't bad, just if you don't do something useful while you're high, then it's a crime. Like the Beatles they were high all the time but they made use of their high time. Bob Dylan too. They wrote amazing songs, but rappers barely write anything. They write songs with rhyming words that aren't even words, and they are extremely profane, with these sexual perversions. I am 13 and my parents and everyone else for that matter, find it fascinating that I HATE rap.|`|2DoTYevCaa	I HATE RAP WITH A PASSION also R&B and Hip Hop its so mediocre you know what...that's a insult to mediocrasy Rap requires you to be a complete idiot sell your soul to money,drugs and stupidity if you think I am wrong look at the streets they are paved with ignorance you can tell they listen to this type of music just by looking at them they are always acting like idiots and whats with the pants sagging? are they asking to get raped by other men?!|`|9cQ4cxg1aa	Some of them have lots of talent when they write their own songs. And rapping is harder than it looks. But rap is certainly not the most challenging music genre.|`|CBIx6wqMaa	Rappers are very talented if not no one would listen to their music. Some of them sing so fast you cant even understand what they are saying so only some are bad at it.|`|pgKr7aCBaa	No!<br>  Most Rap represents ideas and all the struggles people go through with out people having to scream like metal music.
dCewrtXaaa	If he is waking up too early he might just be hungry. If you haven't started him on solid food yet, it's time to. Ask your doc this question. <br>  <br>  And that sounds like too many daytime naps.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Docs say that keeping them up actually makes sleep less rested from a nights sleep and crankier. I just suggest putting him to bed earlier so you can sleep more.
NNwEuC8paa	You have been married for a long time, thats great! Hun your time will come. Everyone is having money issues, its rough, You should really tell your hubby how you feel. For me I would keep trying. it would be hard but having a childern was the reason we were put on this earth, if you feel the way you feel now it could end up messes up your marriage. A baby is a big deal, but a wonderful thing. You will be a great mom, and I think you can support a baby, remember they don't need to have it all. Giving them life is all. Good luck hun!|`|7SVLjYHiaa	wow you have been waiting a long time. 8 years married?!  I don't know but I think if you are emotionally ready in the relationship then you should be ready.  You don't HAVE to be financially ready.  it is possible in any situation to properly care for a child as long as you love it.<br>  <br>  you should spend some time figuring out your finances and budget so that you can take care of any debt.  put some money aside for a baby fund.  it will make you both feel better and more prepared.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	well don't lose hope. god will bless you when he knows your ready.. i myself has been married now for 3 years next month and no luck of babies of our own.  i have a 3 year old daughter that will be 4 in may from a different relationship. so you see it will happen one of these days for all people trying to conceive. I am hoping this is my month. i have been told not to worry about conceiving a child it will happen when go knows i am ready. so best wishes to the both of you and all the people trying to concieve.|`|Kp6LX1JVaa	I know how you feel.  I do have one little guy already, but with the way the economy is, I got laid off, and then hubby told me that we had to stop trying for number two.  I told him no way.  I explained over and over, yes it will be hard for a while, but I want only two, and I want them close in age.  Thankfully since he is a twin, he finally agreed after many many long talks.  I would sit your hubby down, and tell him this is what you truly want.  In my opinion there is never a right time.  Good luck to you.  :)
4iXL4C6paa	It would depend on the circumstances, my husband wanted us to have one more baby and we already had 3 but since we were financially able and I was mentally ready so I decided that we would have one more.  If your husband wants a baby but you dont think it is time then I would suggest you wait, but if you feel like you are ready as well as him then go ahead.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	My boyfriend and I already talked about this and I told him I had no interest in being pregnant so he said adoption is fine.  So if he suddenly wanted to get me pregnant I'd tell him heck no!<br>  <br>  Since you probably haven't talked about it yet, I'd probably talk to him about it.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I'd sit down and have a talk with him,and ask why he wanted this so badly.|`|a12cbnR4aa	Is this something that you want too? Having a baby should be a mutual thing. That way you will have a happy family. This is something you should both talk about with each other.|`|HFKVREiUaa	i would say,let's get it on. but i am already pregnant so i wont be asked that.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	Get pregnant|`|hvIMKEH0aa	Are you ready for having a child?<br>    Think about it.<br>  Do you have enough money to have a baby yet?<br>  Talk to him about it.<br>  Tell him when you're ready it'll be time.. since <br>  he's already ready.<br>  Think of the pro's and con's in this situation.<br>  Having a child is a very big deal.|`|txv7TIgiaa	if you want a baby and feel ready have one if you are not yet ready let him know how you feel he is your husband and if he loves you he will understand...
kaqPSgTVaa	Take them! Both of my doctors, two nurses and a midwife have told me it's fine. I ate them like candy during my 6th and 7th month of pregnancy due to the heartburn I was experiencing and my doctor said it was no problem. My daughter is very healthy and just fine.|`|cO9sxO9raa	I have not taken any myself, but my aunt had a baby last year and she took TUMS through out her whole pregnancy and she has a beautiful healthy baby girl. I am pretty sure she took them when she needed them, of course she didn't swallow them like candy but when her heartburn got bad they seemed to help her a lot. Hope this helps. =)|`|kbIkVS0raa	I take them and they help but only for a short period of time so my doctor told me to take 2 zantac twice a day and it has helped sooo great. The tums are also good for the calcium and I have been taking about 10 a day but my doctor said it was fine and baby is doing great|`|TK0HKu0Iaa	Yes, they are safe and I know exactly how you feel. My fiance's oldest sister is an LPN and she told me that they are safe to take.|`|29338c6aab7b8f59e90afeef2835b86baa	I take them, since they contain calcium which is also good for your bones. I don't think they are harmful. I take one a day sometimes, depends on how bad the heart burn gets.|`|PS91d0wvaa	Tums are fine, every doctor will tell you that, and they are a great source of calcium ( buy the calcium enriched ones) it says right on the package no more than 7 per day for pregnant women. They are safe and they taste better than half the stuff out there. Read the package, it will tell you right on it that they are recommended for pregnant women because they are safe. Just no more than 7 a day.|`|BNFpkozpaa	They are absolutely safe!  I worked for an OB/GYN group for 7 years and we would hand out samples of TUMS to all of our pregnant patients.  Not only do they help with the heartburn and reflux but they also give you the added calcium that you need during pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I'm pregnant right now and I take 4 a day as a calcium supplement.  Congratulations!!!|`|27m0O7wPaa	I took tums the whole second and third trimester.  I thought my chest and throat were on fire.  I also drank small amounts of whole milk.  As long as you don't eat them on a constant basis you should be fine.  Follow the directions on the packaging.  My doctor told me it was okay for me to take them just the other day.  Good luck.|`|0U9469GAaa	My dr said it was fine to take tums..and extra calcium can help.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	My dr said it was fine and to take no more then 6 a day.  I also found that the generic brand from Walmart works better and is cheaper.   Drinking milk also helps a little bit.
JnLoHaoAaa	Like right after delivery? I used pads. I believe at CVS or pretty much any drugstore they have special pads that are very thick and long. I believe they are "medical" pads or something like that|`|tMxGi4hPaa	For the first day I used the enormous hospital pads & the mesh skivvies, but after that I switched to normal undies with always w/wings overnight pads. I had to use those for a few days, then I just switched to normal sized pads.|`|b5JnSBstaa	Forget those dumb pads, they didn't do anything for me. I demanded that my mom go to CVS and get me some depends. I kept leaking all over the hospital room with those mesh panties and pad they gave me. The depends are so awesome and they hold everything in.|`|heDtLdz5aa	pads..the bleeding afterwards shouldn't be any heavier than a normal period|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I think you forgot something in the question dear.  <br>  <br>  I will check back in a minute to see if you added more details.<br>  <br>  At the hospital, they provided these HUGE pads for right after having the baby..... along with these SUPER stretchy mesh undies,  cause unless you have a gigantic pair of undies, you would never fight one of those suckers in your undies unless you cut it into eights....lol!    I wore the mesh undies with the super pad for the first day. <br>  <br>  After that I switched to regular maxi pads that I would normally wear for overnight.  I suggest having a few different types on hand,  the brands you like, because believe me, you don't want to have to send your partner out for pads, you never know what he may come back with (been there done that)  I would have on hand a large absorandt pack, a pack for medium flow, and then a pack of panty liners for when bleeding begins to taper off.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Bring your own. The hospital gives you what looks and feels like twin size mattresses.<br>  <br>  I used Stayfree overnight with wings. =)|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Hospital pads during my stay in the hospital, and then I changed to regular kotex pads after I got out, since my bleeding was still pretty heavy but not heavy to the point where a regular pad wouldn't cut it. I still took home 2-3 extra hospital pads though, just in case the bleeding decided to pick up again.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	I used the hospital pads for the first few days, then switched to Always Overnight with wings.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I can't remember the name but any maternity pads are good.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	Used for what?
VdnAH78Xaa	i was 136 at the beginning, got sick went down to 126. at the end i weighed 166. so 30 pounds.<br>   p.s: congrats! and i love the name Harley. very cute.|`|CE3bmj65aa	I was like you.  I started at 165, went down to 155 and then by the end I was 167.  I didn't gain that weight until the last couple of months.  The day after having my son I was 140 and that is where I still am and he is 4 months.  I am not trying to lose weight; I don't exercise or watch what I eat, but I think breastfeeding is what has kept me from gaining weight now.  I look at breastfeeding as canceling out all that extra and unhealthy food I eat.|`|vLOjcH7paa	I gained A LOT! haha<br>  I started at 125 and went to 179!<br>  20 lbs came off right away and now I have about 20 more to go...I am pretty tall though...so, it's ok.

In my defense I am not skinny to say the least but its a wonderful diet plan I always joke!!! I am 170 lbs now and my 2nd son is now 2 months old. Looks like you going to be on the same track..............Good Luck|`|tMxGi4hPaa	My total gain was 18 lbs. For the first several months I would gain a couple pounds then lose it again. Every other doctor appointment was different- up 3 lbs one time, then back down 4 or 5 lbs the next. I finally started putting on weight and keeping it around 6-7 months. After my daughter was born, I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight in about 2 weeks.|`|b5JnSBstaa	I gained 30 lbs during my entire pregnancy. I went to the dr about a week after I gave birth and I had lost 20 lbs of it!!!!! I guess it was a lot of extra water weight and the baby.  haha.  I was so excited.

wZAeBisbaa	First, I think it's great that as his sister you're taking this seriously and trying to help him.  Are your parents doing the same?  They should be.  One reason why they need to get involved is that the school can't legally talk to you about his grades, but they can talk to his parents. <br>  <br>  Second, it's impossible to decide what to do until you find out what's caused his grades to slip so much.  It could be lack of motivation or  poor time management skills, or because he is distracted by a problem of some sort, or all of these in combination. <br>  <br>  If he is "losing interest," there must be a reason. Unless the action addresses that reason, it won't work.  For instance, limiting his Xbox time won't help if he is being bullied at school.  Offering him rewards won't help if he doesn't care about staying in school.  Study tips only work for those who are motivated to use them.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your parents, talk to him, and then perhaps your parents should talk to his counselor.  This problem needs to be addressed now, before he loses ground academically.  If that happens, the incentive to keep up may be gone.|`|X6as2nOAaa	have him talk with the school counsler to see what they suggest.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Do what they did in Mr. Deeds...or Big Daddy one of those Adam Sandler movies. Show him a gnarly homeless dude and tell him he's gonna end up like that if he doesn't stay in school. In the movie the bum is like " School is for fools, look at me" and the kids run away screaming.|`|NDU36H4Vaa	Kids all over the US including honor students are dropping out of school due to boredom. <br>  <br>  Limiting the X-box or any activity or food that is overused is good because it teaches self-control. People who do not have well developed self control will always struggle. <br>  <br>  Find out everything your brother IS interested in. <br>  <br>  Find out why he does not like school or some classes. Just listen - there is a super helpful description of listening in this exact type of case in Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. This book can be found on Amazon.com for a few dollars used plus $3.99 S&H. It will be worth it. <br>  <br>  A reward system would be a good idea, it needs to be something he helps design if you want his sincere buy in (that book also talks about this in another chapter). <br>  <br>  For the things that he is struggling in, if he can link things he is interested into those subjects, he might end up liking them. For instance, a boy does not like reading but likes fishing. So when his mother order him a fishing magazine, he loves it, and his reading scores improve in school because he is reading. <br>  <br>  Also, I think that it is very important to get him involved in the community. Maybe he could play sports with some kids at the local elementary school a few times a month. If these kids look up to him, it might motivate him. If he feels like his life has value, he won't be so addicted to fantasy & games. <br>  <br>  I would love to know what he doesn't like about school and why. Maybe he can help change things by learning to properly communicate the issues with the local and national government to see things change. My website will have more on this as time progresses & I will be happy to assist more via email <a href="http://www.geocities.com/heather_inks" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/heather_inks</a> and heather_inks@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Also, if he is interested in computers, maybe he can take some computer classes online where he can learn to design games through the local community college system. This is usually about $150 per class and some states must pay for this. <br>  <br>  I used to be a teacher & advisor at Pace Center for Girls specializing in this and then I went to the Volusia County Public Schools to teach tech & also to teach teachers how to integrate technology and improve their curriculums to improve learning & interest so that less students were "lost". There are lots of students who are "lost" meaning their bodies are in class but their minds are somewhere else. <br>  <br>  And I understand, many things are very outdated, the whole system is outdated. If you do well, you are put in courses with more homework, but everyone must graduate at the same time. Adults would not want to all have to go to work and get paid the same (and be forced to retire at the same age), yet some do WAY more work than others. Being able to make more money, save more money, and retire early motivates people to be more productive. The public school system is not very motivating to most students. If students could control when the graduated (after meeting standards regardless of age or grade) then we would see students become very motivated because they could control their future with their actions or inaction. <br>  <br>  I have seen students totally turn things around in amazing ways, I know of two students (a young man and the other a 13 year old girl with a baby) who both turned things around and went into college pre-med from previously almost not graduating. <br>  <br>  I hope this information and that book helps. My website might help and I will be happy to assist more. Sometimes a mentor, someone he looks up to, also works wonders. <br>  <br>  heather_inks@yahoo.com|`|foJm2Yftaa	I have an idea. I got my 13 year old girl interested in school by doing games while learning like : Shelikes playing the guitar soooo..... she has problems with squared. Each note has a squared fact. We write it down and when she plays a note she has to answer the questions by herself then check it over. If your brother is into soccer then like um..... try making a goal thing and play with your brother and his goal is to hit the goal. Then if he does he has to answer questions. So hes gonna have fun and know more at the same time! lol

8Cvv86Jeaa	I know what you mean by your friends disappearing. When I became a mom I found it much easier to be friends with other moms. I didn't want the lifestyle of partying or the friends that came with it so its really like having a child makes you do a 180. As for your boyfriend, sit down and talk to him. Explain why you think it is important that you go back to school. I think its great and I respect mothers like you. Just because someone has a child at a younger age doesn't mean they are going to turn out to be nobody's. You are making something of yourself and thats wonderful.

"How do you feel about me going back to school?"|`|6fiYhtACaa	Honey, that doesn't change no matter how old you are. I had my first baby at 32 - I know, probably old to you, but perfect for me - and I hardly talk to my best friend anymore. She's busy working and going out at night and just in a completely different place mentally. I'm sure you know this already, but 18 is very young by today's standards to start having kids. Many of your friends probably won't be in your shoes for another ten years so don't be surprised if you're not talking to any of them a year from now. You'll probably find that you have a whole different set of friends plus maybe a really good one who hangs in there with you. Forget about the boyfriend, he'll be okay. He has a mother of his own. You need to focus on you and that baby. Good for you for staying in school. You just keep plugging away at it and try not to get caught up in too much relationship drama. 18-year-old boys really are not mature yet, so don't be surprised if he acts less than manly. Just remember to put that baby first.<br>  EDIT Sorry, most 23-year-olds aren't much better.

That name is very original, and i would totally be ALL for it. However, if this kid is going to be raised here in america ( And i am NOT saying the name is bad, i personally like it!!!) it should not be named that. The only reason why i would say no is becuase this kid will get teased from the 'Anus' in his name.

pNPJH1WBaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Dont worry we have all been there and anyone who says their child has never had tantrums or hit them living in a dream world. <br>  <br>  I found the SuperNanny book immensly helpful and followed her advise and it worked wonders. I would highly recommend watching her programmes and getting her book. <br>  <br>  When your toddler tries to hit you adopt a firm low tone and say NO! and push her hand away. Make sure you are consistant and she will get the message eventually it is unfortunately a long process and there is no quick fix. Try not to get angry or flustered otherwise they know they are getting to you. Try to stay calm and adopt a firm voice. She is too young for the naughty step technique I think but I found that by sitting my child on my knee and putting my arms around him (holding his arms down) and gently restraining them this way they can not hit you or themselves and if you hold them fairly tight into your body they have no room to buck backwards and just explain calmly that when they are behaving nicely and have calmed down they can go. I also insisted on a sorry kiss before he could say it and once he was able to he had to say sorry. <br>  <br>  Another thing I found helpful was that if he continued after this I would put him in a room on his own and leave him for two minutes (obviously make sure it is safe and they cant hurt themselves on anything) and say that his behaviour was not acceptable and that he had to stay on his own until he was prepared to be nice to mummy. This worked as he hated to be seperated from me. I usually did this after two warnings. I would tell him his behaviour was not nice, then I would warn him and then he would be put on his own for 2 minutes. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. They all do it and they all grow out of it but I know it is not mice at the time.<br>  <br>  But honestly get supernanny book she is brilliant!|`|1fjhg6j4aa	I'm a mother of four, ranging in age from 10 to 18.  Gently restraining means to put her on your lap, facing outward and putting your arms around her, pinning her arms to her side.  <br>  <br>  I have a child who has an awful temper.  When she would throw temper tantrums, I would separate he from the family by putting her in her room and telling her that she could come out when she was willing to act like a lady.|`|DRZuh6f5aa	take your time with it if it something small like the food dont worry about it she die out of that but the punching you can put her into a room with no toys and let her screem hit her self then when she calms down explain to her what she did our you could have a reward system that when she is go she can put a sticker up on a chart and that so many stickers mean she can do something special good luck!|`|d44703065e36cd1dd93fc03103f892d9aa	When my sons are in their toddler years, and they did something naughty I would talk to them firmly first and tell them that it is bad and explane why it is bad. And if they would repeat the same naughtiness, I would punish them by letting them stand at a corner for a while.|`|9tkea8QTaa	restrain her as much as you need to so that she doesnt hurt herself or you. and be consistent with it. it takes patience and hard work but ive done this method and my son is now a perfect angel|`|nfe2VKA1aa	Find out what is wrong and go from there! take her to the doctor! and see what they say? and make sure they do all they can cause they wil tell you '' oh nothing is wrong''|`|0vpDDM8aaa	couple of good books..... <br>  <br>  Growing Kids God's Way<br>  <br>  Preparation For Parenting<br>  <br>  Shepherding a Child's Heart<br>  <br>  check them out...!|`|sNJ7uHPMaa	when she is bad put her in a room with noone else and leave her there for five min or so. make sure theres nothing in there that she can get hurt with. and also no toys this is a time out. even a play pen works very well place it in the other room. tkae all of the toys out and make her stay there for atleast five minutes. tell her time out and make a sad face or something so she knows she did something wrong. if this dont work then try for longer periods of time. hope this works for you! ive got a 13 month old who has a temper and it worked for me!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Definately put her in time-out.  She is 16 months old....you're telling me you can't hold her down???|`|oojO4WAraa	When that child hits you, stop her immediately, swiftly and surely and make sure it is an unpleasant result for her. EVERY TIME.  You have allowed this.  It is your fault.  <br>  <br>  Skip gentle - instill fear in the child. Get control now.  Yank her up, and firmly put her in a time out chair.  And do not respond to her whining and crying.  Or pick her up and put her in her room and shut the door.  Ignore her cries.  Explain as you are taking her to the punishment place (her timeout chair or her bedroom) what she has done wrong and what is expected of her.  When her time is up, explain it again and tellher what is expected of her. <br>  <br>  Do not use that wimpy, kind voice to try to explain her bad to her - make sure she recognizes you are unhappy with what she has done. Use a deep, loud voice like your father used to use.  Like you mean business.  Not like you are trying to reason with your little darling.  State the rules loud and clear and make sure she knows there will be swift and unpleasant consequences from her behavior - and be consistent.<br>  <br>  You have allowed this to happen.|`|UpwdK1JAaa	Don't laugh when she hits you and immediately take her hand and say NO in a firm voice. If she keeps doing it, she needs to be put in a time out. When she tries to feed you just say "no thank you mommy/daddy already has a drink. Or let her feed her baby dolls. Keep a routine, I know it can be hard, but you have to stick with it and mean what you say.|`|BypjotRpaa	here is a link to help you .. it from baby center, i got it in the email a couple of days ago..hope it has some guidance for you|`|0ky4TktEaa	Normally, i'd suggest a spanking. However, since she is under 2, you have to sort of judge the kind of discipline that would be appropriate taking into consideration her personality and what she responds to. Spanking works for certain children better than taking things away. Some children can ignore a spanking but respond immediately when a favorite item is taken away for an extended period of time. Some children can just be fussed at firmly and they are sensitive enough to respond to that. It all depends on the child.<br>  <br>  In your case, gentle restraint has failed to work. I'd venture to say that it fails to work on most children. You don't need to hold her down to make her stay; that suggests that you, as a parent, will engage in a sort of fight with the child. The child needs to understand that they must stay where you put them because YOU are in charge; not the other way around. So no, don't hold her down. Personally, i'd put her in time out. Not on your lap; in a hard chair on a specified spot that doesn't encourage relaxation or being comfortable. Explain why you've put her there, turn around and walk away. If she gets up, make no comments or eye contact and bring her back to the spot. Cut her some slack if you haven't really done this with her; after you've made this the norm, bring her back ONCE. If she gets up again, give her a swat on the behind, tell her to stay where you put her and walk away. <br>  <br>  As for hitting an adult, that should result in an immediate spank. At most ONE warning, to be followed by a swat on the arm if the behavior continues. As for the fits she throws if you don't eat her food etc, stop sharing food directly off your own plate. Give her her own container even if you serve her food off your plate.|`|220b695ab00eca1c536e15d2f68abdd5aa	If she hits you in the face, you should put her down, walk away and ignore her and tell her "I don't want to be around you if you're going to hit me".  Course, the first time my kids tried that on my mom, she smacked them back.  The kids weren't very impressed, but the behaviour was never seen again.<br>  <br>  As far as the pretend feeding, of course she's going to throw a fit if you don't do what she wants, but, same as above, put her down and walk away.<br>  <br>  Who's the boss?  Who makes the rules?  Who's in charge?  The parent or the baby with the sippy cup?  Are you allowed to throw a tantrum if you don't get your way?  If you don't teach your child appropriate behavior at home with you, how can you ever expect to take her out in public?<br>  <br>  Giving in to a tantrum re-enforces that a tantrum is an acceptable metod to getting what you want.<br>  <br>  With my own children, even if I was planning on giving in to them, if they throw a tantrum, they automatically don't get what they want.  They need to mind their behaviour.
2nfMSDiPaa	During early pregnancy, the cervix becomes closed and blue in color. Cervical mucus also tends to change during this stage of your cycle, so the cervical mucus would begin increasing due to hormonal fluctuation and blood flow to the uterus. <br>  <br>  there might not be enough hcg in your urine to produce a positive pregnancy test, wait 72 hours and take another one, if it is still negative and no menses, get in to see your doctor to find out what is causing it.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun!<br>  God bless<br>  Billions of baby dust to you!!|`|LTUk0cRWaa	A test would definitely be accurate now. I would run to the drugstore and get one....it sounds like you could definitely be prego.|`|we9sS2tNaa	If you were prego it should have shown up on the test by now. Wait another week then retake the test if it's still negative you should go see the doctor and ask for a blood test. Then you'll know for sure. The blood will detect it.
66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	Dont give her any money. She is a liar. Let her send the receipts to your parents, what does it really matter? Get a restraining order.|`|cJfJd9yaaa	Don't give her the money.  It sounds like she does this to a lot of guys and is in on a scam with her uncle.  Why should you have to pay for the entire pill anyway?  It takes 2 to tango.  Tell her to get a lawyer and sue you for the $540 if she wants it that badly.  No court in the world would make you pay for it anyway.  I bet she backs down when you say to her about the lawyer.  Let your parents know what this girl is trying to do but don't let her know that.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Wow - she sounds like a liar. The major flaw is that if the abortion pill fails, you don't get another one - you get a surgical abortion. You can only have the pill under 8 weeks, and once you know you're pregnant you're 4 weeks along already.. so if she was given the second pill "a couple weeks later", she probably would have passed the 8 week limit.<br>  <br>  The privacy law doesn't mean that she can't give permission for her uncle to speak to you. If she allows it, then you can talk to him.|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Dont give her anymore $. And you should get some sort of restraining order...|`|27m0O7wPaa	WOW she is a little nuts.  HIPAA is a big deal but if she told the doctor who is also very conveniently her Uncle that he could talk to you and signed a waiver then it would be okay for him to disclose that info.  It sounds like she is lying.  She could get those receipts or even fabricate them pretty easily I'm sure.  She sounds conniving.  You should ask her to take a pee test in front of you for proof if she wants to prove it so bad.  There is no law that says a father has to be involved check out all of the deadbeats everywhere.  Ignore her.  I'm sorry dude.  That really sucks I hope you get it all figured out.
5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Ah, an intelligent questioner with an amazing vocabulary (THANKS!).<br>  <br>  Yes, for me - my next oldest sister, who was always perfect, and in raising two daughters, the youngest was always the 'prettiest', the 'perfect angel', and the older one she would kind of treat shabbily (not abusive or neglectful) because she was chubby and not a blondie like the other, and she'd say 'oh, she's like her dad' when she would mean that her daughter wasn't smart. (Gee, I wanna growl, here...)<br>  BUT tables got turned big time when the older daughter turned out to be a raving auburn-haired beauty, with a FAB personality and character and is excelling at university.<br>  The younger daughter - well, frankly, I'm scared for what's in her future, she's now in gr. 9 and has a tough row to hoe because all she knows is superficiality and is very immature.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	I've known all my life that some children are more demanding then others so my line of thinking would be more like "better her than me".<br>  Sorry.   I don't recall getting any pleasure out of it unless the kid is doing something funny.    I think I would be more inclined to feel compassion in most circumstances.|`|NxxAPRuVaa	im not a parent but sum parents dont kno wat 2 do lol there kids running screaming and throwin a fit and the parents looking around like"i hope no 1 c's me" then so parents have kids on little toddler leashes|`|cAtWxJG1aa	a particularly unpleasant local parent, who is perpetually personally attacking other parents and school administrators, made a particularly vicious and unprovoked public attack on our town's school administrators a day or so ago, and then realized that her facts were verifiably totally wrong, so had to issue a public apology.  i'm sure it makes me a bad person, but i kept the apology in my email because it rather cheers me up that she was forced to issue it, and I''m sure it killed her.<br>  <br>  i try not to revel in other people's misery, but she so had it coming.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I just feel sorry for them because I know how that is.

9QVjNaIPaa	it can go either way! i was really scared with my first that i wouldnt know when it was 'time' either. my doctor kept telling me it would feel like severe period cramps that wouldnt go away but i never used to get period cramps so i didnt even know what that felt like. however, when i did actually start having contractions, i knew! well not for sure at first so i started timing them and realized that over a two hour period they had regulated to coming every 5 mins and were getting stronger so i called the doc and she said to come on in! my water broke at the hospital about 8 hours later and then my daughter was born an hour after that.|`|QSodlfMraa	any one can happen first water break or contraction can start.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	yeah probably mucus plug. and no water doesn't have to break first, do you have contractions now. start timing them, and if you feel a pop in belly then water will break. are you with someone, wheres your daughter? i hope that everything goes well!

p65mPSozaa	I had an epidural.  As soon as I got that I vomit and didn't feel to good.  My whole body started shaking.  But just as it set in there was no pain. I had my epidural at 5am and my baby was out by 1:30pm the same day.<br>  <br>  It is different for everyone....best of luck.|`|ZVofYvMyaa	I was in labor for 10 hours with my daughter. And For the first few hours the pain was mild and uncomfortable, but not agonizing. It started to get worse in the later stages of labor when the I started to dialate more. I had to get an epidural because I could walk around due to high blood pressure, and i knew if i could have walked around i wouldnt have needed the epidural. Even though i got the shot, I was only numb on half the side of my body; I could still feel the pain! Eventually it kicked in, but my labor was almost over by then. <br>  <br>  As for the throwing up part. I pushed for 15 min and she came out. I did at one point feel nauseous and they gave me a puke pan, but I never threw up. The reason you throw up is because of all the pressure you put on your head and body pushing the baby out. I've heard people pushing for an hour or so. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|28QPS6V9aa	I was in labor for 28 hours and the agonizing pain didn't start until about the seventh hour into it. Then it got extreme! I had an all natural birth so the pain didn't go away until my daughter was born. I only threw up once but some people throw up a lot or not at all. That's why when you're in the hospital you're not allowed to eat solids while you're in labor because it increases your risk for vomiting. Many people get sick from an epidural. I don't know why I got sick, probably because there is just so much going on with your body while in labor and it makes ya sick.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	Usually it's when labor actually starts, and they aren't in horrible pain the whole time. <br>  You could throw up in labor, some women do.  Your body is going through lots of stress, and thats usually the cause.|`|TQYaNGdSaa	Everyone has a different story about labour. My 1st was 72 hours my second was just 4 hours. I wont lie to you labour is painfull my second was as painfull as my first just didnt last as long. but there is plenty of pain releif should you need it. i had gas and air and paethidine with my 1st and just gas and air with my second. And beleive me all that pain is SOOOOO worth it when your baby is born that it seems a distnat memory. ( cant be that bad we all keep doing it again hey ?!) I suppose the sick may be from pain releif that you have i remember my biggest fear was doing a no.2!! Lol The pain starts mild and gets worse. I think that they consider you are in labour 2/3 cm dilated but that depends on where you are having your baby. I think that the worse pain is before you start to push cos when you are allowed to push you kinda push through the pain and it really helps. Anyhow hope this helps.<br>  Good luck|`|I2UeqxKxaa	when i had my wee boy i was in labour for 10 hours but the pain didnt start untill after about 3 hours but its different for everyone my waters broke first then the pain started i did feel a bit sick but wasnt actually sick i dont know why this happens maybe its something to do with the gas and air|`|v3LnJycKaa	i threw up in transitional labor both times, this is between 5-8 cm, when things ae really going, start to finish labor is the 20 hours etc you hear about,|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	I cannot say for anyone else but when I say my labor was 19 hours long with my first and 8 hours with my second I usually am saying that it was 19 hours and 8 hours long from when the contractions started to the birth of my child.<br>  <br>  I threw up with each of my labors when I was about 8 CM, the nurse that was there for the birth of my second child told me that a lot of women throw up around 8-9 CM, it's an indicator they watch for to tell how far along someone is prior to checking, she says it pretty reliable.

I totally remember dreading getting out of bed because my pelvic bones would pop and it hurt.  When you are pregnant your body releases a chemical called Relaxin that makes all your joints and ligaments looser for childbirth.  It's normal.  As for sleeping on your back--it's really not that bad--I would wake up all the time like that near the end of my pregnancy and I would panic, but I think your body will wake you up before you hurt anything.<br>  <br>  Try to enjoy you last few weeks before the chaos.

It didn't happen at all with my first pregnancy.|`|IOp3knBjaa	Ok good, so I am not the only one that has this problem! I wake up, after falling asleep on my side, and I'm on my back. Lately for about this last month I have felt the pelvic pain while trying to get up not to mention bad back pain. I really have alot of trouble getting out of bed these days! Best of luck to ya!|`|3EiOobEVaa	Yes they have been popping for a week and it is very uncomfortable...I also wake up on my back and have no clue how i got there.

If you had a child and named her that, you would be handicapping her for the future - people with tricky names like those tend to be associated with low-education, low-income households, and it's a fact of life that a lot of businesses would just as soon throw out a resume as spend a bunch of time trying to pronounce the applicant's name.<br>  <br>  Raegan is doable. I'd leave everything else alone, or at the very least pair ONE of the weird names as a middle name to a more traditional first name.|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Madalina Rafaela is pretty if it's of your ethnicity.

a0e64779677c884ea4ca4c17390ea954aa	"He's a good eater"  That is the joke in our house when our son 14 months now does the same. I swear at times he eats more then me. at times he will eat a fist size portion of Lentils and brown rice 3-4 tablespoons of mixed veggies, 1/2 a cup of milk, then a 1/2 cup of rice cerial, 1 jar of stage two veggies, a jar of stage two pears, and a cookie,In one sitting, and has eaten like that from about 6 months on. He is tall and thin and perfectly healthy, and will stop eating when he is full. My guess is that yours will also, as long as he is healthy I wouldn't worry. I would possibly let him eat some "big people food" like mac-n-cheese, lentils,rice, mashed potatoes, etc. they seem to hold ours a little better.  <br>   Best of luck,|`|Bw18seFqaa	At 6 months he is hitting a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  He may also be teething and perhaps eating is soothing to him.<br>  <br>  Talk to his pediatrician.|`|dgRTkccBaa	He's probably getting ready for a growth spurt.  Whenever my kids would go through a growth spurt they would eat like crazy and then sleep more, and a week later none of their clothes would fit, lol!|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Your baby is just fine and hungry so feed him haha.  He's going through a growth spurt.|`|haabfMtkaa	I would not worry about over feeding if he is not hungry he wont eat. Its not like he is eating his feelings or bored. My kids go through this too my 5 year old will eat eat eat for one month and not even touch it the next. I think your right he is probably going through a growth spurt. Give him healthy stuff so you don't have to worry about how much he is eating but if he is telling you he is hungry then he is.Talk to the Dr. if this is still bothering you.

It was sweetened and he took it with no problems.|`|Q7lvSU03aa	I suggest looking at the drsears.com website.<br>  <br>  The nice thing about the rotavirus is that it is not a shot.  <br>  <br>  Personally I have chosen to spread out the shots, as well as put off some that I don't think they need as an infant.

2nfMSDiPaa	Hey hun sorry to hear the loss hun!<br>  <br>  Improving Male Fertility<br>  <br>  There are natural ways to improve male fertility. <br>  There are few common rules to start with.<br>  <br>  1. Limit or eliminate caffeine intake.<br>  2. Stop smoking<br>  3. Stop Recreational Drugs<br>  4. Wear Loose Underwear (boxers)<br>  5. Stay out of Hot Tubs<br>  6. Quit drinking alcoholic beverages<br>  <br>  Vitamin B12<br>  <br>  Zinc is an essential nutrient for proper sperm production. A deficiency may result in lowered testosterone levels.. The usual recommended dosage of zinc is about 15 to 30 mg daily, coupled with 1 mg of copper for balance. Too much zinc can be toxic. Do not exceed a dose of 15 to 30 mg daily<br>  <br>  This mineral is found in great amounts in the outer layer of sperm and plays an important role in the production of the hormone testosterone.<br>  <br>  Anti-Oxidants are necessary for good sperm health.<br>  <br>  Vitamin E, Supplementation with this antioxidant has been shown to increase sperm motility and to enhance the ability of the sperm to penetrate the egg in test-tube studies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope This helps Billions of baby dust to you!!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's okay for a short time, but it's levels of iron are too high for men and could cause him to get hemochromatosis.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	no, it will not help him to conceive.|`|we9sS2tNaa	The vitamins are good as far as health but it has nothing to do with his sperm. Prenatal vitamins don't really boost your chances of getting prego it's just to keep the baby well in case you don't make good choices as far as nutrition. Just make sure he doesn't wear tight clothes and he doesn't sit in hot tubs too much that's it. The most important thing is NO STRESS! that can actually keep you from getting prego.|`|xxLmNJYLaa	It's not a stupid question, i think that might help men im not sure though

miPubuDYaa	If you go to the hospital and your contractions are not regular they will check you. See if you are dialated and effaced. If you arent that far along. They will either tell you to go home and wait it out or make you walk in circles around the hospital<br>  <br>  My girlfriend went to the hospital on Valentines day because she was 2cm dialated and having irregular contractions too. They sent her home. She sat on the couch for one week before her contractions became regular at 10 min aprat. She spent 12 hours in the hospital before she was given potosen to speed up the labor. She finally gave birth on Feb 21st.<br>  <br>  Call your doctor. He will advise you better.|`|SRzswqTeaa	The pelvic pain when you walk sounds like normal pelvis pain due to it stretching.  It can be very painful!  Contractions will be in your belly, and perhaps your back.  They will come even if you are laying down.  The hospital will not admit you if you are not having contractions, even if you are dilated.  I've been 5cm and 100% effaced, and sent home!  So wait until you are having contractions that last about 45 seconds to a minute, and they are 5 minutes apart.  The contractions will start out farther apart, and become longer, stronger and closer together.  True labor will not stop.  I'm sorry you are experiencing the pelvic pain.  I know how hard it is to function.  But labor will start soon, and this will be a thing of the past. .I promise!!|`|28QPS6V9aa	They will check you, but if you're not in labor they will send you home. They don't like keeping people there just because they have pain. If they did that the hospital would be so full people would have to give birth in the hallways. Unfortunately the pain is just part of being pregnant and you're just going to have to deal with it. You can go to the hospital but it will probably just be a waste of your time.|`|veO1RXrCaa	All you can do is go and see.  I had bad contractions when I was in hard labour in my back.  They may not admit you for irregular contractions though.  And pain meds like your epidural aren't given until you are more dilated.  Try taking a regular strength tylenol and if your water has not broken sit in a warm/slightly hot tub to help loosen the cramps.  Or try a heating pad.  Im 37 weeks and miserable too!  I feel your pain hun.|`|pNwOmAPoaa	If it's not yet regular then it might be that you are not yet about to give birth.  You may go to the hospital if you like but they most likely will tell you to go home.  Just take note of the intervals of your contractions.  It doesn't have to be exactly 30 minutes or 15 minutes apart.  Time it in and if it gets closer and closer, then by all means go.  You don't have to wait for an intense pain for your might have a good pain tolerance.  Some women don't experience intense contractions because they can bear with the pain unlike some women who can't.|`|diT2WFfCaa	If you are really unsure, rather than actually going to the hospital, only to (possibly) be sent home, call you doctor's office.  They usually have a nurse practitioner who is available to talk to you over the phone.  <br>  <br>  You can tell them what you are experiencing, and they will be able to get you in to see the doctor, recommend going to the hospital, or tell you if you should just wait it out.<br>  <br>  An advantage to that is that if they do recommend going to the hospital, your doctors office can call ahead and let them know you will be coming, which will decrease your chances of just being sent home.|`|Cb004Oz3aa	No, trust your body and get yourself to the hospital. I went in when I was having them randomly and they just gave me some meds to make them normal. If on monday you were already 3cm and 75% effaced you could go very quickly. With my second son I told them I felt like I needed to push because the pelvic ares was hurting so bad and they admitted me.|`|DudYpfWVaa	yes they will keep you based on the 3cm and that you sound like your in laber.. I would go and let them check you any way just to be safe.|`|eu6UQElYaa	They probably would but you might not want to go that route.  Unless you are dilated to 4cm they probably wouldn't give you an epidural yet anyways, so you'd just be taking up a bed in the hospital and still be in pain.   And there are a limited number of beds, so generally it's advised for women who aren't in active, hard labor to stay home because then they don't take up a bed and sit there while another women on her 3rd child, dilated to 8cm comes in and needs a bed NOW.   Because of the limited beds and the need to keep them open, they would likely end up inducing you just to speed things along.  And if you think it's bad now just wait until they pump you full of pitocin.  <br>  <br>  Really though it's a judgement call on your part.   If you feel like you might be dilated to 4 cm and just absolutely can't stand the pain and sitting around home then go for it if you need to.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It's really not a good idea.  You should wait until the contractions are at least 3 minutes apart before even going to the hospital.  They may admit you, but you will likely run the risk of being induced and if you don't progress fast enough they will send you in for a c section.  You don't need that.  The pain is perfectly normal at this point.  The labor hasn't started yet because baby isn't done yet.  When baby's lungs have finished developing they send out a hormone that sends you into true labor and it also brings in your milk and allows baby to bond.  Have patience, go for walks, drink lots of water, but it is to early to go to the hospital.

q31cxfCTaa	It's said to be more cause they've never been through it...they don't know what it's like...They really don't know what teens have to go through. They think teen mothers are too young to make a living so the gov./social security is handing out money here and there. But in most cases there not.<br>  .........................................<br>  Because they think there lifestyle is so much better than a teen mother's. Mostly because waiting for marriage is best....but sometimes (i know some will disagree) things just happen. Sometimes even if your strong willed something happens then you look back and you ask yourself: Why? Why did I just do that? How?<br>  People see so much bad teen parenting that they don't stop and give credit to the great teen parents. And plus, no body knows what happened...the teen could have been raped and is absolutely against abortion...which is great. but they need to remember there are plenty of terrible married parent out there to discriminate against.<br>  I think it's mostly older people....old styled. And older people are said to have more wisdom with more experience that's why I think they discriminate against teen mothers because of age.<br>  But you definitely can tell if a teen mother is a terrible one just by watching them for a few minutes even at the store. As well as married mother's.<br>  I think the criticism is something that just is and I don't think it'll ever change. Just live through it. Don't worry about anything of that matter. Just be you. Be the great mom that you are and let all negativism go threw one ear and out the other. Don't let it bother you.<br>  Just think--in a few years which will fly by you won't be a teen mother any more.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	I don't assume that.  But I do think people who pop out babies KNOWING they can't afford them should be spayed--regardless of age.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Because that's all they want to see. My thing is also that single mothers who work are also helping to pay for the services that they use. If they work, they also have to pay their taxes!!! Teen pregnancy is just now being more out there than it used to be. I guess a lot of peoples issue is that if you can't take care of your kid then don't get pregnant. They can think that all they want, but it's not going to stop all teen pregnancy. It's going to happen whether we want it or not. You just can't get a very good job as a teenager which means that you cannot provide as well for your child than someone who is established and has gone to college. It doesn't make you a bad mother. As long as your child has what they need and a loving home that's all that should matter.

9P26sacKaa	Round ligament pain is described by exactly what you say you are feeling.  Sharp stabbing pain or a dull ache that may be exaggerated when you move suddenly or move in general.  It's only a worry if the pain is severe AND doesn't go away, if you also have bleeding or cramping, if you have a fever or other signs of a urinary tract infection.  Many (maybe even most) pregnant women experience some round ligament pain starting in the second trimester.  It can be quite alarming because it's not something one normally feels when not pregnant.  It can feel like something is tearing or stretching inside you.  <br>  <br>  The cramps you had earlier were probably unrelated, and your doctor's and nurse's diagnosis just verifies this.<br>  <br>  Try massaging the place where it hurts often and drink plenty of water.  There might be some dietary things you can do to help, but I can't find any information on that right now.  It's so normal during pregnancy that people don't do anything about it.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	It probably is round ligament pain.  You need to calm yourself down, because stress isn't good for baby either. <br>  At 15 weeks, even if there was something else wrong, there isn't much they can do. <br>  If you have bleeding, then go to the ER.  Otherwise just try to think happy thoughts and calm down. <br>  Good luck.|`|VFUdAtrHaa	i have serve adominal pain but its in my upper stomach and i demanded more test to be done. Im going today at 230 to get the results im almost postive that its gladstones. When they said it was the muscle stretching. I haven't ate since tuesday cause it puts me into so much pain. SO if your not happy with your doctor get a second opinion or demand they do test. If you don't give your child a voice no one else will! I will keep you and you baby in my prays but im sure everything will be fine. <br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless!
a8IRxC4raa	You can always get a second opinion, but treatment is often not necessary.  Since treatment can be quite painful, the band-aid suggestion was a good idea, IMO.  Babies have tender skin.  I can see why your doc wanted to see if it would clear up on its own first. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/molluscum_contagiosum/page6_em.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emedicinehealth.com/molluscum...</a>|`|y6g0RnuAaa	Most times this does not need to be treated. It is a virus and has to run it's course. If the lesions become infected or inflamed then antibiotics should be prescribed and the infection will go away but not the lesions. They will go away on their own in time- weeks or months. At 6 months he should have a healthy immune system and they will be gone in no time.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Yes, I had that (though I was more like 6 years of age).  I don't think there's much I can tell you about the condition- I had warts, particularly in the crook of my elbow, but also spreading to other body parts.  Some doctors advised squeezing them, but that hurt and didn't really do much that I could tell, since it didn't actually get rid of them.<br>  <br>  The treatment was to have liquid nitrogen sprayed on the worst-affected area to freeze it; this 'killed' the warts and apparently caused my immune system to trigger, as the ones on other parts of my body went away too.  I just have a few small pockmarks on my arm where they were, nothing noticable.<br>  <br>  However, having liquid nitrogen applied HURTS- it's very cold.  Perhaps this is the reason they will not refer such a young child for treatment, they're worried it will harm him.  I'd discuss the reasons with your pediatrician if you're not sure, it may be that keeping them clean and covered so that they don't spread any more is the best way to deal with it until he gets a bit older.|`|nfe2VKA1aa	You should try this!<br>  ZymaDerm? - Molluscum Treatment<br>  <br>  It may help!|`|IGXE3aDraa	get a new doctor|`|Zew5sfbyaa	find a new pedi
wqAgZkKhaa	What Causes High Blood Pressure - Hypertension     <br>    <br>    Quite a few people in this world dont know what causes high blood pressure and hypertension. Hypertension is more common in blacks, and the risk increases with age. One-fourth of people in the United States between the ages of 20-74 have hypertension, and three-fourths of women and two-thirds of men over 75 have hypertension.<br>   Blood pressure is described by two values: <br>   - The highest pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts.<br>   - The lowest pressure just before the heart contracts. <br>   When you take your blood pressure look for certain numbers to inform you if your pressure is high or low. Blood pressure is considered high when the systolic pressure is above 140 and the diastolic pressure is above 90.<br>   When a change in blood pressure occurs, the body has a sudden means of returning back to normal. These include changing the amount of blood that the heart pumps, controlling the diameter of the arteries, and changing the volume of blood in the bloodstream. The kidneys can also control blood pressure by excreting salt and water in the blood so that the blood volume decreases.<br>   People who have hypertension, the increase in pressure may be due to a change in the heart, blood vessels or an increase in the blood volume. Other factors contributing to hypertension include an inherited abnormality, obesity, sedentary lifestyle, stress, smoking, excessive alcohol and salt.<br>   Most people with hypertension experience no symptons from hypertension itself, however, once damage has occurred to other organs as a result of hypertension like the brain, eyes, heart or the kidneys. Symptoms of those conditions may manifest themselves as headaches, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, restlessness, and blurred vision. The higher the pressure, the more likely you are to experience a stroke, heart failure or early death.<br>      By: Colon Bolden<br>    Article Directory: <a href="http://www.articledashboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com</a><br>   ?<br>    Colon Bolden is a outstanding internet marketer in the home business arena.

Congrats on ur baby|`|YYNpbvpeaa	My son was born weighing 7 lbs 1 oz. He only did the 2 oz of formula for about a week, if that. He was eating 5 oz by the time he was 3 weeks old. But he is almost 3 months, and he still eats 5 oz at a time. He started out eating a lot at once, but has stayed at the same amount for a long time rather than eating a little bit at first and increasing by an ounce a month (like the doctors say they should). I say that something is wrong if a baby NEVER turns away a bottle. When they are full, they stop. Once in a while, we mistake a baby for hungry, make the bottle, offer it and they don't even want it. I think that's the sign that a baby knows their hunger-level.|`|xvH98hWuaa	my son is 1 month old and when he was 4 days old he was taking 4 ounces, but about every 2.5 or 3 hours. and i breast feed him that's just how much he would drink when i would have to give him a bottle. BUt he was born 8 pounds 6 ounces. and everyone said that was too much and to not feed him that much but he is always hungry ha ha right now he weighs 13 pounds. so yea it could be normal and every baby is different|`|iPAFnJVAaa	My first son was 9lbs 2.3oz and at 5 days old he was drinking about 6oz every 3 hours.<br>  My second son was 8lbs 7.7 oz and he was drinking about 8oz every 3 1/2 hours.<br>   I talked to the doctor about it and he told me to let my baby eat as much as he wanted as long as it didn't make him sick. He told me that he will let you kow when he's hungry as well as when he's full.<br>  Hope this helps!
WPI0Z47saa	There is no way for us to tell you when YOU personally ovulated since everyone is different. You need to take an ovulation test that you can buy in the drug store to know that and it doesn't even always fall at the same time each month. I ovulate on day 21, my sister in law does the week after her period, my friend does 2 days before her period and my mom got pregnant on her period so you can see that it isn't always 10-14 days after your period. My husband and I just had sex every 2-3 days for a month to make sure we didn't miss it no matter what and that sperm was always available for when the egg was released. Also sperm can survive in the bod up to 7 days around ovulation. We got pregnant the first month we tried however you only have a 25% chance of becoming pregnant each month even if you hit ovulation perfectly. Anyway, you wouldn't really notice any changes in your body for several weeks after you become pregnant so if you haven't even missed your period yet then there is not a whole lot to guess on right now. You can take a test up to 5 days before your missed period but these have high false negative rates. Sometimes if your hormone levels are low you won't be able to find out through a urine test for several weeks into your pregnancy so if you get a negative right away but no period, don't give up hope yet. I didn't register on a urine test until I was 7 almost 8 weeks pregnant. It was confirmed through a blood test at 2 weeks by my doctor and I kept testing at home because I wanted to see for myself. So I hope that you are but if you get your period, just start having sex every few days for the next month and this will highly increase your chances of getting pregnant quicker. Good luck and I hope that I gave you ome useful information.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Sure. :)  <br>  <br>  You were probably most fertile between February 13 and February 18.  You probably ovulated somewhere in between there, so since you BD'd pretty much every day for 3 weeks, you have a pretty good chance of catching ovulation (if you ovulated and everything).<br>  <br>  That would mean you are 3 weeks pregnant and due November 9th. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust!!!!|`|QrQWQ1nraa	Ok, so I just found out 2 days ago that I am pregnant, and what the nurse had explaind to me is that if there is sperm present in the body any day from the first day of your last regular mensturation (bleeding) to day 15, you cold get prego!  She also said that sperm usually live for 3 days in the body.<br>   For me ly last regular cycle was Dec. 27th and my hubby & I got married on the 4th.  Sure enough that was my day 9 and hence I was a good candidate for getting prego!   Hope this helps!  Good luck!|`|FgmvpQZBaa	hello<br>  <br>  im not much of a baby expert but have you tried a pregnancy test??? because they usually tell the truth also if you are pregnant i think that you should bleed just a bit depense. but if your vigina feels sorta heavy ask your mum i know that sounds weird but she went trough the same thing probly.. hope that helps...bets of luck honey!!!|`|1kIncajqaa	Don't panic.

kaqPSgTVaa	You should see a doctor to have a blood test done. If it's not pregnancy you'll need to figure out what is delaying your period and giving you these symptoms.
WXExyAlWaa	Yes a couple of months in you start getting a fair amount of discharge - it's to keep your vaginal passage clean, ironically, because it won't keep your underwear clean.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	Yes. Wear pantie liners .|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah and it is so bad, i change underwear 2 to 3 times a day.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	Yes my discharge only got worser i sometimes have to wear pantie liners it gets so bad.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yes, it is common for your discharge to increase while pregnant.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes|`|2vHIn8VMaa	yes, it increases|`|lYZ71zYAaa	Yes and it can get messy. Wear panty liners
v0aKxF6iaa	Well all i had was his first and last name and i found him! i knew a lady who worked for cps and looked up his name in the dps data base and i knew the city he lived in and she gave me the address and now he should soon be getting child support papers in the mail! there are ways to find these things out you just have to keep trying and good luck!|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	they don't need proof. you can just put unknown on the birth certificate. a paternity test sounds like your best answer.|`|HpQd2zrgaa	WELL GUD|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	Are you sure that you have his real name? He could have just given you an alias.<br>  The only way that I can think of, of confirming that he's the father would be a paternity test. <br>  If his name is really common then it would be harder to find him. I guess it's possible.
u1uECuFNaa	Don't do it!!!!<br>  <br>  A recent study suggests that women who smoke anytime during the month before pregnancy to the end of the first trimester are more likely to have a baby with birth defects, particularly congenital heart defects (7). The risk of heart defects appears to increase with the number of cigarettes a woman smokes.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	If you aren't pregnant it won't hurt any baby you may have in the future no. Many women have smoked before pregnancy or even smoked and then found out they were pregnant and were fine as long as they quit. You will be fine.|`|fMnzjULCaa	Smoke to your hearts content (I wish I could hehe)! Yeah smoking isn't good for you, but if you know for sure you aren't pregnant, one night isn't going to hurt you!<br>  <br>  EDIT:::I know plenty of people who only smoke when they drink or smoke when they are visting w/ people. Geez, it doesn't make you a follower.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Ok,so you're telling me you smoke because she smokes.. Are you serious? If you have that much trouble with peer pressure,then maybe you shouldn't be friends with her. <br>  You should just tell her,hey husband and I are trying for a baby,and I want to be as healthy as I can be,not that hard,really.|`|vGxipYJnaa	I doubt it would have any negative effect on a future baby - but smoking can reduce fertility and quality of egg which leads to miscarriage.<br>  <br>  I'm sure it would be fine - but why smoke if you aren't addicted anyway?|`|a12cbnR4aa	If you don't smoke regularly why would you submit your self to it just because your friend does. This sounds kind of "high school" to me.|`|BNFpkozpaa	You should not smoke while trying to conceive.  It can cause infertility and your body should be in optimum health when becoming pregnant.  If this is something that you really want, you will see that you need to quit smoking.|`|ugqaVrM9aa	If ur trying to get pregnant, it would be best to just not smoke at all. Other people are more or less fertile than others, depending on the way your body works and functions. <br>  its up to you though, what do u find more important?|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	its fine. its recommended to not smoke while trying to get pregnant, but realistically I wouldn't worry|`|HPRlEWu1aa	honestly i wouldnt .. i smoked for 8 yrs and as soon as my husband and i started talking about ttc we both quit .. u wanna make sure ur body is as healthy as it can possibly be if ure planning on growing a baby in there|`|txv7TIgiaa	if you are getting ready to get pregnant than you might want to get used to not smoking at all... and you don't want to risk getting addicted right before you get pregnant...|`|qLkknQx1aa	of course there is no benefit to smoking other than the fact that it may saved a few lives by calming someone down enough to not go out and kill someone, but with that said, i am a pack a day smoker (bad me, i know), and got pregnant twice. - your body starts to heal within twelve hours of your last cigarette, so as long as you stop, you start to get better and i don't see it having any long term effect as far as getting pregnant goes, but i am NOT a doctor.
kaqPSgTVaa	Take a test if you don't get your period still in a few more days. That's really all you can do. Discharge can be normal and cramping before a period is normal as well.
E5CnUdhsaa	i had to to take the liner out then fold it down which as a big pain in the butt when wwe went shopping! thankgod it was atravel system with carseat so much easier!|`|4YIUxSlYaa	The 3d liner needs to be taken out, it can be folded with it in but it will wreck the liner after a bit.<br>  <br>  My sister has the 3d.|`|hFoYmSgqaa	i have the freeway linear which is similar. you have to take it apart as it is too heavy to put back up again.
ZLpgjLPyaa	I am on day 82 and havent gotten mine. They just diagnosed me with PCOS. This is the 1st time i have ever missed my period and not been pregnant. THe dr gave me a prescription of 10mg progesterone/provera to take for 12 days then i am onto clomid(we are trying to get pregnant). Good luck and call your doctor to get them to induce your period, you dont want to go too long without one.
44PnMUCLaa	I'm so sorry you've had no luck yet.  I will share my story...<br>  <br>  We had not been trying but two months, and I decided to use Pre Seed.  We got pregnant the first time we used it.  Now, I don't know if it was the PS, or if it was just good timing.  I will say, that the ingredients of PS are not magic.  It merely creates a better environment for the sperm.  At the most, I would think it only increases your odds that the sperm last longer or swim better.  Saying that, it certainly doesn't hurt to try it.  And, I would try it more than one month if you don't fall preggers the first time...Good luck...I hope this helps a little.  *****STICKY STICKY BABY DUST******|`|G2ULVLbCaa	DH and i used it last month for the first time.  I didn't fall pregnant but i cant see where it would hurt to try it.  I have no complaints about it and i'm continuing to use it this cycle so hopefully we will get our success story soon.<br>  <br>  We have been ttc for almost a year now as well, and everyone keeps telling me to just relax and stop trying to conceive and then it will happen so once i figure out how to do that maybe hubby and i will finally conceive number one.  ha ha<br>  <br>  Good luck to you though!! Hope you get your BFP!|`|S5n5Za78aa	me personally have not preggo using it yet  but alot of ppl do here i stole someones answer from another post to give you a success story <br>  <br>  (Best Answer - Chosen by Voters<br>  I got pregnant the first month using it but even if everything is done right you still only have like a 20-25% chance of getting pregnant each month. I used the external Pre' for 2 months before I used Pre-seed. <br>  Pre-seed doesn't really help you get pregnant but helps the little guys swim to where they need to go if that is the issue keepig you from getting pregnant. I used it because after my Copper IUD was removed I didn't get as much EWCM.)|`|QPEdSnOSaa	I was using it for 4 months because I don't produce a lot of EWCM and I still haven't been pregnant, not even a scare! Some people swear by it, some people don't. It all depends on the timing and whether or not you are ovulating. This month I decided to give everything up, OPKs, Charting, Pre-Seed, etc. so we'll see if it worked this month or not. Good luck and keep us posted! :)
kaqPSgTVaa	This is most likely not a "period period" You are more than likely going to have messed up periods for a few months. Especially if you stopped taking it before and have only been on it again for 5 months.
CuTvFlxTaa	Is it at a church? They will probably drink pop and eat crisps or what ever is on offer. Maybe they have pool/snooker there. My girls age 10 + 7go to church on Wednesdays. Its called treasures, the play games, have fruit or toast for an hour and a quarter. Its 70p. I'd ask the youth leaders. Personally I think they are a bit young for youth. They are not youths yet. They are still children. Youth at church is age 11+.|`|2dJIJr6uaa	i went to a youth club when i was little and it was normally just games and socialising. we would play badminton and them little team games.

9Kax4Kekaa	People get pregnant when then use a condom incorrectly.  The whole pull out theory is a lie.  The penis secretes a pre-seamenal cleaning liquid before the sperm are ejaculated.  This cleaning fluid contains some sperm, and as we all know, it only takes one sperm you to get pregnant. <br>  <br>  Make sure he has the condom on before anything enters anywhere, he can finish inside you and there is no problem.  However he does need to make sure to leave some space at the tip of the condom for the sperm and to grab the end of the condom when he pulls out.  Since at that point the penis should be starting to shrink and the condom can be get caught inside you while he pulls out.  <br>  <br>  Condoms with spermicide are 99% effective (WHEN USED CORRECTLY)|`|u1uECuFNaa	There is always a chance. You have sex, you can get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Most condoms are not put on correctly or tear..that is how pregnancy occurs.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most likely not...|`|vGxipYJnaa	It would be very unlikely that you'd become pregnant. Use a condom with spermicide to be extra safe.|`|dn2UCOkqaa	What do you think? If you don't know this yourself you shouldn't be having sex.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	pull out NEVER works <br>  condoms like 89 %|`|kDXk8JcMaa	yeah but what fun is that for him.. You should let him take to condom off.. and he should be burying it when he gets off.
k6LwKYCvaa	Im sure your fine... it doesn't sound like the semen even came close to your vagina. If your really worried about it go to a CVS and get "plan B" which will terminate the possible pregnancy. Good Luck!|`|taOckxHxaa	You are most likely not pregnant, though of course no guarantees.

v5SXqxo0aa	Tatiana or Tatyana is a Slavic female name derived from the Roman name Tatianus, which was derived from the Roman clan name Tatius. Titus Tatius was a king. <br>  <br>  The name honours Orthodox Saint Tatiana who was tortured and martyred in the persecutions of Emperor Alexander Severus c.230 in Rome. Saint Tatiana is also considered a patron saint of students.

haabfMtkaa	To be completely honest with you with all 3 of my kids it took a good 2 years to loses the baby weight. You are so busy with your child that it is really hard really really hard. I am not saying not to even try but don't be so hard on yourself the time will come when you can focus on yourself and your body and through the first year our so your body WILL start drooping some of that weight that was there to help your little one grow. So I have a little girl who is just about 2 and I have lost about 20 lbs. from just watching what I eat and everyday things that come with having three kids but now since she is old enough (I feel) to go to the kids club at the gym we go daily. I love it she has tuns of fun and I am finally getting back to my happy weight|`|fCHAGmqRaa	I just has a baby two weeks ago and I'm already in my pre-pregnancy jeans.

GWveqx61aa	well right about the time you had the brownish and pinkish discharge is right about the time implantation but actually too early. its closer to the time youd ovulate, but that should be redder blood., id wait about 2 days and take a preg test.lmp 2-24 ovulation around 2-28. implantation around 3-6 to 3-10,if implantation happened too early it could be in your tubes, id try to find out asap?~☆good luck☆~?

MubTZUKXaa	Each area has different rules and criteria on who is eligible for IVF funding.  Check on google what your PCT's (primary care trust.. who pays for the treatment) rules are.<br>  I do know that:<br>  #  You HAVE to be aged 23 before they fund any treatment (I had to wait until my 23rd birthday for my treatment)  I know this rule applies to every area.<br>  <br>  # Your partners age is irrelevant.  You age is the only age they take into account.  The Women has to be aged between 23-35 (some PCT's fund IVF for Women slightly over 35)<br>  <br>  # I think you have had to have a diagnosed fertility problem for a set period of time.  They may fund you based on unexplained infertility but I'm not sure.. they may also treat you due to your partners low sperm count.<br>  <br>  In the mean time (as you won't get IVF before turning 23) why don't you get one of those self help books which might be able to advise on how your partner can improve his sperm count.. Get one that will also have tips on how you can increase your fertility.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope you are one of the many lucky people who conceive while waiting for their treatment!

My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IVF. Went through the IVF injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IVF and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indianmedguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianmedguru.com</a><br>  You can get much information in this website.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	Whether you are eligible or not can vary from area to area as there are limited funds and high demand. Your case will be decided by your GP and based on you being healthy they may want to focus on your partner and changing his lifestyle to increase his sperm count. If that does not work then you may be eligible but will most likely be put on a waiting list. I think the NHS limits you to 2 rounds of treatment.

AA11197832	Well...im def. not encouraging anything but with my first baby I smoked moderate to heavily throughout my whole pregnancy and he was a healthy weight and is healthy today and he's 2.<br>  Im also currently 6 months pregnant and am smoking more now than ever, I know what u mean when u say u cant stop.  Im addicted to...once I have this baby im gonna get on the patch and quit once and for all.<br>  One thing that has helped a little is to monitor your smoking<br>  Write down when you smoked a cigarette and what triggered it (social--after a meal) etc...good luck hun...|`|xGlqXMRAaa	You should quit regardless of whether your pregnant or not.  I know its hard but think of the risk that you are causing for yourself, what happens when you decide to have a baby (if your not pregnant), you could end up having a high risk pregnancy because of your history of smoking, if any pregnancy at all.  As far as having the determination, if you dont have the determination now its most likely that you wont have the determination even if your pregnant.  Thats one of the things thats so awful about smoking its so addictive that even when you want to stop your body makes it almost impossible for you to do it, especially if you are constantly stressed.  It all comes down to deciding to better yourself or to keep doing something that could potentially be fatal.|`|Xla2eJveaa	Smoking is associated with miscarriage, low birth weight and premature babies. It reduces oxygen supply to baby, slows down growth rate and possibly damages the DNA. Nicotine further destroys vitamin C and removes depletes from your body|`|2vHIn8VMaa	STOP SMOKING!! first of all pregnant or not, it will kill u. Also, the baby will be affected now if u are pregnant. Just look at pictures with babies that had mothers that smoked while they were pregnant! its horrible!|`|rWoaRdljaa	yes it will. it can lead to your baby being mentally retarded or physically as well (not always but it increases the chances) and your baby will be addicted as well and will have a shorter life expectancy|`|k6LwKYCvaa	Yes... lol|`|HpQd2zrgaa	not if you like downs syndrome and adhd and autism.|`|b4a7YtTsaa	Yes....stop ASAP!|`|937a245fe9009f32d52407116d92a7b5aa	Yes  most of the fetus' organs develop before we even know we are pregnant.  Smoking has been associated with a number of pregnancy complications. One is an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. In an ectopic pregnancy, the embryo becomes implanted in a fallopian tube or other abnormal site instead of the uterus. With the rarest of exceptions, these pregnancies do not result in the birth of a baby, and must be removed surgically or with drug treatment to protect a woman's life.<br>  <br>  Cigarette smoking also appears to double a woman's risk of developing placental complications (which occur in about 1 percent of pregnancies). These include placenta previa, a condition in which the placenta is attached too low in the uterus and covers part or all of the cervix; and placental abruptio, in which the placenta separates from the uterine wall before delivery. Both can result in a delivery that jeopardizes the life of mother and baby.<br>  <br>  Smoking during pregnancy also increases the risk of stillbirth, miscarriage, and severe vaginal bleeding.smoking increases the risk of preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation) by about 30 percent. It also increases the likelihood of certain birth defects, including a cleft lip and/or cleft palate (an opening in the roof of the mouth or the soft tissue in the back of the mouth).<br>  <br>  Babies who weigh less than 5 1/2 pounds at birth face an increased risk of serious health problems during the newborn period, chronic disabilities (such as cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and learning problems), and even death.<br>  <br>  Babies of mothers who smoke are twice as likely to die from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as babies of nonsmokers. Children who are exposed to cigarette smoke before birth also may be at increased risk of lasting problems, including asthma, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  So better quit now before it's too late.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	yes definitely- i think you mean 4 weeks & 3 days darling. Count from the first day of you last period darling...<br>  at 3 weeks : pregnancy<br>  2 weeks after last period is ovulation<br>  <br>  You need to stop or cut down - the first 12 weeks Are the most important of babies development<br>  god bless x|`|fMnzjULCaa	I smoked until I was 7 or 8 weeks pregnant. I was the same way. I couldn't quit w/out knowing. Geez, that sounds so selfish now. I'm warning you, you are going to regret it if you are pregnant. As soon as I found out though I majorly cut down & I quit for good in my 7th week. I had smoked for 13 years too, so you can do it, no excuses! I told my doctor & they haven't made a big deal about it. Also I work for a health insurance company who was offering women who quit smoking before their 20th week free diapers for a year as a healthy baby incentive. Health insurance companies don't do anything unless it benefits them & they certainly do their research. So basically they don't want to pay for a sick baby & will bribe you w/ diapers. But they wanted you to quit before the 20th week, so take what you want from that. I'd quit as soon as possible if I were you. Your baby coughs in the womb. =(|`|NDQS5HJyaa	To be honest, I'll probably get thumbs downs for this, but I've smoked with both of my pregnancies. My OBs have told me to cut back, which I have--but also quitting full turkey can cause harm too. You suffer withdrawals obviously, which can be transferred to the baby. Both of my pregnancies have been fine so far, but it IS a major risk you take. Breathing problems, early birth/low birth weight, and other complications come a long with it. My mom smoked with me too, and lots of my family members have smoked while pregnant... but its not something I like to condone, because every pregnancy can have a different outcome. It's personal preference. I try not to smoke when I'm really far a long in pregnancy in public because people tend to butt their nose in my business and get really opinonated on the subject, so it really is personal preference. I don't see how people just stop cold turkey. I tried a few days ago, to cut back on money and for my health, and it did NOT work.|`|UgIOVl1jaa	Yes it can harm your baby & yes you can quit smoking if you want what's best for your child.  You want your body to be in the best shape it can be in & if you're trying to conceive I'd recommend quitting now.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	can it ahrm baby DUHHH<br>  my friend smokes ( i did to once) <br>  she has had 4 pregnancies <br>  2 of them miscarrieages<br>  her girl has breathing problems to this day at 12|`|AA10643879	Extremely harmful,STOP IT,for the sake of the baby....!And yourself too.!|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	honestly, no one can tell you a yes or no about this. (if it will effect the baby THIS early)<br>  <br>  you need to at least be trying to cut back A LOT...so if the test comes up positive, you don't go through super bad withdrawel symptoms.<br>  <br>  if you smoke 2 packs a day...cut back to 10 a day this week, 5 a day next week....and none a day, when the stick turns pink.<br>  <br>  cuz long term - if you keep smoking, you ARE more likley to lose the baby to miscarriage. that we all know.<br>  <br>  ADD: samantha...do you REALLY believe that there are just as many toxins in the air we breathe, as in cigerettes?<br>  <br>  not all women will have problems when they smoke and have a child, and to say the child will be disabled or brain damaged, whenever a pregnant woman smokes. is definitely a reach....however, i personally know someone who lost her baby at 18 weeks and she smoked up till the day it happend. very sad to say goodbye to a tiny little baby and always wonder if its cuz she couldn't quit smoking. look on the side of the pack - 'preterm labor' <br>  <br>  look at the long term effects that can come from a early labor, after 24 weeks.... cerbral palsy, learning delays, physical and developemental delays...not 'directly' linked to the cigerette...but if they happen from a pre term labor and that was caused by smoking, well there ya go.<br>  <br>  its best to cut WAAAAY back and then quit completely. then you know you did your best for your baby...and put the baby first.|`|6v4KYFGoaa	Smoking will harm the baby! Even drinking alcohol will harm your baby. If you are planning to be pregnant you should have thought about all the things you should do before, during, and after pregnancy. <br>  Talk to a doctor on how you should change your life style to keep the baby healthy as possible.|`|XrKviWgSaa	yeah it can, if you think you are pregnant you need to stop now even if you do not know, it can cause miscarriage, low birth weight, breathing problems, preterm labor, all of that you need to stop NOW if you think you might be so your baby does not have any health problems.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit.

All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Yes and this is the worst time for smoking since the first 12 weeks is when your baby's organs form including the heart, brain and lungs. You need to talk to a doctor asap for help in quitting.|`|f34d8af07990dc3e462c898fc5a7609faa	yes, it can harm your baby. it can mental and physically alter the child. the child also has a higher risk of dieing from S.I.D.'s|`|t9S0dqfLaa	Take a test~Duh|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Yes there is always a risk. But what about the pollution we breath in every single day? All the smog and exhaust from vehicles and everything else that is floating around in the air? I'm actually really serious about this. There are far, far more toxins in the air, then there is in a cigarette. Or what about the chemicals we drink in our water? Or the hormones in our meat? Everyone is so down right pissed about  pregnant smoking and I think there are a lot of other things to consider as well. <br>  I smoked with my last baby. Probably half a pack a day, maybe less. He was born at 10.3. And has never had any illnesses, or disease, or birth defects, or breathing problems. Because he was so big, he slept through the night at day 2. I have the perfect baby. And I mean perfect. <br>  <br>  Smoking is your decisions. Your going to have a lot of angry holier then though bullsh*t shoved down your throat. And I think a lot of women just need to shut the hell about. Save your crap for someone who actually cares. Your not doing anybody any favors by screaming your preachy sh*t to anyone.<br>  <br>  Give me all the thumbs down you want, but I am sick and tired of your stupid rants because you think your mother of the year.

That being said you can always trim. Or if you must shave it, why tell your mom? Would she ever know otherwise?? I know my mom wouldn't have had.

However, I think it's perfectly okay to do so if you really think you want to.|`|Y4hmK3wSaa	I wouldn't worry about too much.If you want to shave down their, it is your opinion, not hers. You can get a razor and shave it, or shave most of it off, then wax the rest off, or use really, really sticky tape. I wouldn't bring it up. If you feel you must, just say my pubic hair is getting too long, and is sticking out of my underwear. Plus it is very itchy. That is all you have to do.

WvOvoxLxaa	If your child is ready to eat food and can keep it down then you should feed them. He should be able to eat cereal with some fruit and he shouldn't get constipated.  When Doctors say when to feed a child, that is only a guideline kind of like a recipe is only a guide, you can add or take things away to satisfy your own taste.  My youngest was over 10 pounds when born, and she wanted to eat she needed food because formula just didn't satisfy her. You do what you think is best for your child, if he reacts to it badly then stop doing it.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	actually 6 months is preffered by the AAP-<br>  <br>   holding head is not on the list- they need to SIT UP by themselves, have a pincher grasp. also by feeding hims o young you are setting up for possible food allerges, obesity later on and diabetes<br>  <br>  "Health experts and breastfeeding experts agree that it's best to wait until your baby is around six months old before offering solid foods. There has been a large amount of research on this in the recent past, and most health organizations have updated their recommendations to agree with current research. Unfortunately, many health care providers are not up to date in what they're telling parents, and many, many books are not up to date.<br>  <br>  The following organizations recommend that all babies be exclusively breastfed (no cereal, juice or any other foods) for the first 6 months of life (not the first 4-6 months):<br>  World Health Organization <br>  UNICEF <br>  US Department of Health & Human Services <br>  American Academy of Pediatrics <br>  American Academy of Family Physicians <br>  American Dietetic Association <br>  Australian National Health and Medical Research Council <br>  Royal Australian College of General Practitioners <br>  Health Canada<br>  <br>  Delaying solids gives baby greater protection from illness.<br>  Although babies continue to receive many immunities from breastmilk for as long as they nurse, the greatest immunity occurs while a baby is exclusively breastfed. Breastmilk contains 50+ known immune factors, and probably many more that are still unknown. One study has shown that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 4+ months had 40% fewer ear infections than breastfed babies whose diets were supplemented with other foods. The probability of respiratory illness occurring at any time during childhood is significantly reduced if the child is fed exclusively breast milk for at least 15 weeks and no solid foods are introduced during this time. (Wilson, 1998) Many other studies have also linked the degree of exclusivity of breastfeeding to enhanced health benefits (see Immune factors in human milk and Risks of Artificial Feeding). <br>  <br>  Delaying solids gives baby's digestive system time to mature. <br>  If solids are started before a baby's system is ready to handle them, they are poorly digested and may cause unpleasant reactions (digestive upset, gas, constipation, etc.). Protein digestion is incomplete in infancy. Gastric acid and pepsin are secreted at birth and increase toward adult values over the following 3 to 4 months. The pancreatic enzyme amylase does not reach adequate levels for digestion of starches until around 6 months, and carbohydrate enzymes such as maltase, isomaltase, and sucrase do not reach adult levels until around 7 months. Young infants also have low levels of lipase and bile salts, so fat digestion does not reach adult levels until 6-9 months. <br>  <br>  <br>  Delaying solids decreases the risk of food allergies. <br>  It is well documented that prolonged exclusive breastfeeding results in a lower incidence of food allergies (see Allergy References and Risks of Artificial Feeding). From birth until somewhere between four and six months of age, babies possess what is often referred to as an "open gut." This means that the spaces between the cells of the small intestines will readily allow intact macromolecules, including whole proteins and pathogens, to pass directly into the bloodstream.This is great for your breastfed baby as it allows beneficial antibodies in breastmilk to pass more directly into baby's bloodstream, but it also means that large proteins from other foods (which may predispose baby to allergies) and disease-causing pathogens can pass right through, too. During baby's first 4-6 months, while the gut is still "open," antibodies (sIgA) from breastmilk coat baby's digestive tract and provide passive immunity, reducing the likelihood of illness and allergic reactions before gut closure occurs. Baby starts producing these antibodies on his own at around 6 months, and gut closure should have occurred by this time also. See How Breast Milk Protects Newborns and The Case for the Virgin Gut for more on this subject.<br>  <br>  <br>  Delaying solids helps to protect baby from iron-deficiency anemia.<br>  The introduction of iron supplements and iron-fortified foods, particularly during the first six months, reduces the efficiency of baby's iron absorption. Healthy, full-term infants who are breastfed exclusively for periods of 6-9 months have been shown to maintain normal hemoglobin values and normal iron stores. In one study (Pisacane, 1995), the researchers concluded that babies who were exclusively breastfed for 7 months (and were not give iron supplements or iron-fortified cereals) had significantly higher hemoglobin levels at one year than breastfed babies who received solid foods earlier than seven months. The researchers found no cases of anemia within the first year in babies breastfed exclusively for seven months and concluded that breastfeeding exclusively for seven months reduces th|`|b5JnSBstaa	I would definately talk to your pediatrician.  I've done tons of research and the AAP is now recommending not starting solids until 6 months. It doesn't just have to do with their "signs of readiness". A baby's intestines and stomach are not yet fully developed and aren't supposed to be handling solid foods. I think you should have consulted your baby's dr before you did this b/c it does seem really early to me.  My dr said the earliest to even try with my son was 4 months.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Really your 3 month old can sit up UNassisted? And has a pincer grasp?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-when.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  Solids readiness depends on both the maturity of baby’s digestive tract and baby’s developmental readiness for solids. Although the maturity of baby’s digestive system is not something that we can readily observe, research indicates that 6 months appears to be ideal for avoiding the allergies and other health risks of too-early solids. After this point, different babies are ready for solids at different times -- developmental readiness for solids cannot be determined using a calendar. Most babies are developmentally ready for solids somewhere between 6 and 8 months.<br>  Signs that indicate baby is developmentally ready for solids include:<br>  <br>      * Baby can sit up well without support.<br>      * Baby has lost the tongue-thrust reflex and does not automatically push solids out of his mouth with his tongue.<br>      * Baby is ready and willing to chew.<br>      * Baby is developing a “pincer” grasp, where he picks up food or other objects between thumb and forefinger. Using the fingers and scraping the food into the palm of the hand (palmar grasp) does not substitute for pincer grasp development.<br>      * Baby is eager to participate in mealtime and may try to grab food and put it in his mouth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org/FAQ/solids.html</a><br>   in preparation for beginning solids in a few months. You will notice that:<br>  <br>      * he becomes more sociable, playing and holding "conversations" with you during a nursing session<br>      * he has a growth spurt and nurses more frequently for a while<br>      * he imitates the chewing motions you make whilst eating -- he is practicing!<br>  <br>  You will know that he is really ready to start solids when:<br>  <br>      * he is about six months old<br>      * he can sit up without any support<br>      * he continues to be hungry despite more frequent nursing which is unrelated to illness or teething<br>      * he has lost the tongue-thrusting reflex and does not push solids out of his mouth<br>      * he can pick up things with his finger and thumb (pincer grasp)<br>  <br>  Babies who are ready for solids can usually feed themselves. Mothers often report that they knew their babies were ready when they picked up food from a plate, chewed it, swallowed it, and wanted more.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit3.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit3.asp</a><br>   Now we know that an infant's gut is not ready for solid foods until around six months of age. If you start a food too early, he is much more likely to become allergic to it. This can result in damage to the intestines, weight loss, blood in the stool, and malnutrition. You might argue, "Well, my kids started solid foods at three weeks, and they turned out just fine." The truth is, very few adults have perfectly working digestive tracts. Just look at all the commercials for heartburn remedies and stool softeners... "ever feel gassy and bloated after a meal?"<br>  <br>  Here is what the experts are saying now:<br>  <br>      * Breastfeed for at least one year.<br>      * Start cereal and other solids after six months of age. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids/solids-diabetes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...</a><br>  In both studies, introduction of rice or gluten-containing cereals before 3 months of age increased baby's risk for type I diabetes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/faq/fit18.asp</a><br>  This subject keeps coming up, and the answer is still the same: the current recommendations (I didn’t make these up) are to wait until six months before starting solids. Starting foods too early can result in digestive or allergy problems later in life. We have learned that the old guidelines of 4 months are just too soon, and I am willing to bet that in ten years we will be recommending later than 6 months. But for now, the six month guideline seems reasonable.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/916697.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/916697...</a><br>  Government guidelines suggest that babies should not be fed solid food until they are at least four months old.<br>  <br>  This is because babies who move onto solids too early risk becoming overweight and developing heart problems when they grow older.<br>  <br>  However, few mothers follow that advice. Figures produced in 1995 show that as many as two out of three mothers feed their babies solids before they are four months old.<br>  <br>  And a study carried out in Scotland found that while most mothers are aware of the guidelines, few know why they should follow them. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/4410.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles...</a><br>  Another study found a similar risk for introducing gluten-containing foods too soon.<br>  <br>  Both studies suggest that starting solid food at the wrong time could overwhelm at-risk infants' immature immune systems and trigger changes that might lead to diabetes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/1141261.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotl...</a><br>  What we have shown is that any early introduction of solids is linked with a poor ability to vasodilate the blood vessels," she said.<br>  <br>  "To find out that what you ate in the first year of life is affecting your heart and blood vessels by the time you are a teenager is quite remarkable.<br>  <br>  "We have also found links between some of the risk factors for heart disease and the way these children were fed during infancy, in particular cholesterol and blood sugar levels. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthy.net/scr/news.asp?Id=8602" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthy.net/scr/news.asp?Id=8...</a><br>  Doctors encourage mothers to supplement breastfeeding with solids far too early. And, as a result, the children are far more prone to allergic problems, and especially eczema, new research has found.<br>  <br>  In a review of 13 studies, researchers discovered that babies who were introduced to solids before they were four months old were far more likely to develop allergic problems such as eczema, which, in some cases, lasted for 10 years.<br>  <br>  Another study discovered a link between early introduction of solids and pollen allergy such as hay fever.<br>  <br>  The researchers also found some evidence that may link solids with asthma, food allergies, allergic rhinitis, and animal dander allergy, although it was not convincing, they said.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wholesomebabyfood.com/nitratearticle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://wholesomebabyfood.com/nitratearti...</a><br>  "Because the intake of naturally occurring nitrates from foods such as green beans, carrots, squash, spinach, and beets can be as high as or higher than that from well water, these foods should be avoided before 3 months of age, "<br>  <br>  and "Preventive strategy would be not to introduce home preparations of these vegetables to infants before 3 months of age, although there is no nutritional indication to add complementary foods to the diet of the healthy term infant before 4 to 6 months of age.23 Infants fed commercially prepared infant foods after 3 months of age generally are not at risk of nitrate poisoning, although the containers should be refrigerated after first use and discarded within 24 hours of opening.

They say not to feed them solids until they're 4-6 months old because they have an immature digestive system. Have you tried putting a teaspoon of rice cereal in his bottle of milk to thicken it up so he stays fuller for longer? If not, try that, if it doesn't work, I would ask your doctor as feeding babies solids at nearly 3 months is a controversial subject. I started feeding my son (now 2) at 3 1/2 months and he's fine. In the end, you're his mother and you know him best and what's best for him. Good luck.<br>  Actually Australia has done a recent study and they have changed their recommendations from six months to anytime between 4-6 months, whenever your baby is ready.|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	I don't think you should feed a 2 1/2 month old solid food, but I can't tell you what to do with your baby.

Once he can sit with support, then I'd start thinking about cereal.|`|AA10088149	My friend's son was a big baby with a huge appetite and he started solids at around 2 and half months on the recommendation of her mother-in-law - who was a paediatrician...but the health visitor wasn't too pleased - he is now a very healthy, allergy free 9 year old - still big (tall) for his age. <br>  There is a huge debate about this - recommendation from WHO is no solids until 6 months (exclusive breastfeeding until then) (actually this was two years ago so it might have changed again)..  this recommendation is to do with an increase in upset stomachs and associated problems. Some people think there is a link with developing allergies later in life. Other people think that milk has more calories than almost anything else so babies can't possibly be showing signs of being hungry that could be satisfied by mashed carrot.<br>   I started my daughter on baby rice at 3 and half months...she was giving all the signs of being ready and I think that they get to the stage where they need to feel something in their tummies (also I didn't realise the recommendations had changed from 4 months). My health visitor said I should give her top-ups of formula milk rather than solids -but then that goes against the WHO recommendations.... <br>  Babies develop at different rates -so I think you have to make your own judgement - but I would be inclined to hold off for as long as possible if they had a family history of allergies/intolerances.<br>  I always think that if you were in a primitive tribe and your baby was behaving as he is would you wait to give him solids?<br>  Also for years and years mothers were being told to put their babies to sleep on their fronts ...and the incidence of SIDS rose...and then when they realised they changed the recommendations ...ummmm<br>  <br>  Just realised that there has been a huge increase in posts since I initially read this  - so I think I should clarify that as far as I could find out at the time the WHO recommendation was based mainly on research which found an increase in gastrointestinal infections in Belarus. Also WHO say that both iron and zinc deficiency may be a problem in some babies who were exclusively breastfed upto 6 months and recommend these babies should be given iron/zinc supplements but not complementary feeding (!). Finally there has been some research that shows that introducing solids too late may cause problems with a baby's ability to deal with 'lumpy' food...<br>  As a postdoctoral research scientist (though not in this field) I would always try to find the original research and even then try and make a critical judgement on it ...if you look at scientific research not all of it will agree and someone has to have got it wrong...or be misinterpreting their findings<br>  When my first child was weaned (in 2001) the recommendation was 4 months ... in addition cow's milk should not be given in any form until 12 months - you could buy fromage frais made with baby formula ...that has now been changed to cow's milk should not be the main drink but small quantities can be used for cooking  (does anyone else feel that the companies who make follow on milk had some part to play in the original recommendation?)  Also I would draw attention to the increase in nut allergies following recommendations of total exclusion from diet and the recent research that has 'cured' nut allergies by the gradual increase in exposure to the allergen.<br>  BTW I breasfed both my children, my first up to 18 months (stopped because of a short stay in hospital) and my second to 2 years - so not anti-breastfeeding - just think that maybe we have lost sight of how our babies develop at differing rates and are too dependant on being told how to nuture them...|`|pXSKSS3daa	"and a few days in a row he was just screaming the hungry-scream every 2 hours almost all day. I was having to fend him off with the pacifier, which meant sitting there for 2 hours with a screaming baby and popping that binky back in between screams."<br>  <br>  Uh, yeah, that's why you feed your baby on DEMAND. If the poor thing wanted more formula after two hours then give it to him. Don't force him to go longer because you think he should.<br>  <br>  Just because your baby shows signs of readiness does NOT mean he is ready. His digestive system isn't ready for solids until closer to 6 months and that's all there is to it. Your husband is right. You are not. If your baby is hungry offer MORE formula, not solid food that is going to wreak havoc on his digestive system.|`|IlyS8KGzaa	You seem pretty gung-ho about doing it no matter what anyone else thinks, so why bother asking this question.

Or Welfare|`|IGAzs2UEaa	dont make her sacrifice her youth. we come here only once.|`|AA11828121	He has to support the baby..It's called going to court and filing for child support.<br>  <br>  She also needs to have her parents inform his parents of the situation :)|`|XHZ5JwmCaa	Wows this kinda reminds me of the secret life of the American teenager, anyway i think maybe you should go to court bc he should support the baby bc its his to he just isn't pregnant. Girls always get blamed for having sex bc every1 can see that a girl teen had sex but they cant c it in a boy bc they aren't in the process of delivering a baby so go to court bc the judge will kno that this is his responsibility too. BTW the baby is not a bad thing having sex at 17 doesn't have to be bad so tell your friend tht bc her life is probably miserable right now so keep supporting her.|`|PZT4wyGoaa	Typical of a guy in that situation.  That's how it was with the guy that got my sister pregnant at 17.  I think the best thing would be adoption.  It will probably be the hardest thing in the world, and the biggest sacrifice your friend will ever make if she chooses this.  But ultimately, it will be the best thing for this baby.  He or she needs two parents, a mom that isn't going through high school and college, and a stable, normal family life.  There are so many adoption options.  My family is LDS, and she placed him for adoption through somewhere called LDS Family Services.  They are amazing.  She has it set up so that they send her pictures really often, and they email her to let her know how he's doing.  She can see him, too, if she wants to, but she doesn't want to confuse him, so she hasn't.  He's already 5 months old, and when he turns 18, if he wants to, his parents are going to put him in contact with my sister and they're going to meet each other.  Adoption really is a wonderful thing.  There are so many couples out there that want a baby so bad, and your friend might just be the blessing that one of them has been waiting for so long for.|`|79aZQf4qaa	should have used a condom. let her keep it, give the kid a chance|`|LklBuVAXaa	He can't be forced to pay anyways since he's only 17.  His parents would have to pay.  Once he turns 18 then he's on the hook for support.<br>  <br>  All she has to do is drop a child support complaint with the local CPS.  She needs to establish paternity also.  What if he's not the father?  I know I know...he was the only one right?  Whatever....she still needs to establish paternity.  Either by court ordered test or admission of the father.<br>  <br>  PS...its her body and her life.....all you can do is tell her how you feel about the situation.  In other words...tell her what you would do if you were in her place.|`|FOtNl2Lxaa	she probably needs to talk with her parents they are going to find out one way or another...|`|uY8yP8EPaa	No matter how much he denies it HE CAN'T HIDE--- his DNA is going to be traceable in the baby if she gets the baby tested. <br>  So yeah no matter what he says, he'll have to be involved because he'll need to pay child support. <br>  Good luck|`|ClZWgDoxaa	I'm pretty sure he's required by law to support the baby with money; that does not mean he has to be around and married, just must support.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	he has to support the baby its the law, she will have to file for child support and he will be forced to pay.|`|k6LwKYCvaa	He has to support the baby... he doesnt really have a choice!

I would immediately get all the info I could on the guy so he can't skip town so he can be tracked down for DNA testing and child support. Right now thats all she can do until the baby is born. <br>  <br>  It dosen't seem fair that she has to strt on the finances first, but it takes two. If she wants to keep it she has to make sure she is somewhat financially stable.|`|FAZjuBIsaa	good, she SHOULD keep the baby. when they were having sex, the guy should have thought of the possibility of a pregnancy then! everytime u have sex, there is the possibility that this person will be in ur life forever. even if they choose not to father the child they HAVE to be a part of the mothers life, and vise versa. im pretty sure it is ILLEGAL for him to flat out refuse. by law, he has to support the mother and child with money. if he refuses, sue him. ah the beauty of child support! :]|`|OB1fa0vjaa	That guy those not deserve the baby, because it's hes child that doesn't love or care.

4Bgw5xs8aa	To me, if I adopted a child BOTH would be my "own". ..They are both my children and it makes no difference that I didn't give birth to one.<br>  <br>  We have a little 3 1/2 month old girl, and want at least one more. I have kidney problems and having her made them even worse..so I probably won't be carrying another child. So we are DEFINITELY adopting a boy within the next year or so. I'm starting the paperwork up this summer, and if all goes well we'll have a baby soon after that.<br>  <br>  There are so many little unwanted babies and children out there. Personally, I think if a family can afford it, that they should adopt at least one child.|`|6fiYhtACaa	I have a baby of my own but would only consider adoption if the baby or child was an orphan or coming from truly abject misery. I don't think that I could rationalize paying 30K to adopt a baby from some poor impoverished woman knowing that the 30K might have been just what that woman needed to keep and support her child for a few or more years. 30k is alot of money in some third world countries. I'd rather keep a child with his mother than fulfill my own desires.|`|o2YHnKXiaa	I would honestly do both, They are both wonderful things to me.<br>  I have a 7 month old son right now and I will be trying for another in about 2-3 years and I am hoping it's a girl me and my hubby want a total of 3-4 children and at least one adopted child but we would treat that child like our own :)|`|XeJtUGoSaa	Interesting question.<br>  <br>  I have one of each (adopted & biological) and they are "both my own." We adopted first from foster care & then got pregnant. Both ways to build a family are equally special & the bond I have with my children is indescribeable!! I would love to do both again:-)|`|z8YGEk0qaa	I would rather have my own so I could go through the whole experience and have a baby that is all mine...but I would also adopt after having one of my own first of course. It depends on the person.|`|foJm2Yftaa	It depends on what situation I'm in. If I can't have any children I would adopt. But since I have 3 children well I am not adopting. I love them all. ;)|`|37dab5663389d7a1f34cbddd0a2bdab0aa	We've been TTC our first child for over 3 years.<br>  <br>  If adoption was a more affordable option, we'd be looking into that.|`|mAxChwHTaa	depends on whats going on in my life... but i do want to adopt a child..|`|3vh7h6iYaa	I desperately wanted to adopt my kids because I have strong feelings about overpopulation, but it is much too expensive.  We were told that a healthy newborn would cost us $30-40,000 and that is just not possible for a middle-class family.  Plus there is lots of red tape and I don't feel like adoptive parents are treated with respect by adoption agencies; it seemed like we were just a walking check to them!  So we went ahead and had a baby the old-fashioned way and are trying for another.  Pregnancy and childbirth are really amazing experiences, so if you cannot adopt just go that way-- you can't go wrong!|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	LOL...I was in the process of adopting when I found out I was prego!!! And I wanted to adopt for the reason that I didn't want to be prego!! lol.<br>  But my son is now 10months and I love him to death!! But could have done without the pregnancy!!! And not really a big fan of the whole infant thing, we were going to adopt a child that was at least 3yrs old.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Both are beautiful things.  <br>  <br>  Ever since I was little I wanted to adopt.  Well, I became pregnant and had my son.  I am currently hoping to concieve another child as well. <br>  <br>  My husband still talk about adopting someday.  But we have to wait until we are more fincially secure and have a larger home and more to provide for an adopted child or children.  We don't think we could afford or fit the criteria for adoption at this time.  There is a lot of legal expenses and stuff involved in adopting.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	I have a daughter of my own, who I love very much. But my husband and I are considering adoption for our next child, we're just not sure. I'd love to adopt, I see no reason for there to be so many children who don't have a mommy and daddy. It just breaks my heart. The only obstacles that would stand in our way would probably be finances, it's so expensive to adopt and we're still young so I'm not sure if they'd consider us quite yet. My husband makes good money, but adoption rates are just insane.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	I would rather have my own. adoption is fine if thats what you want, or if you cant have your own but i like having a child that is mad  up of me and my husband, its so special to  look at our kids and know they came from me and him.......it also helps because you know the childs medical background|`|EeGgovyCaa	My own.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	No, there is not a 100% chance of survival for a baby born at 28 weeks.  There is not even a 100% chance of survival for a baby born at 40 weeks!<br>  <br>  The more premature a baby is, the more likely it is for their to be complications, including death.<br>  <br>  For every baby born severely premature and is fine, there are HUNDREDS that were born at the same time and died or suffer from severe complications.  <br>  <br>  It is important to carry your baby as long as possible.|`|VHHis05Naa	No, there isn't a 100% chance at survival and they might not be just fine.  Some babies end up with disabilities and some develop serious health issues that are lifelong or even fatal.|`|vue9NOhYaa	No, 100% of babies born at 28 weeks do not survive. Such a baby is 3 months early. Survival rates are currently around 90%, but a large percentage of babies will have long term disabilities. (And, of course, a baby born at 28 weeks will be spending several months in the NICU.)|`|eu6UQElYaa	They're chances of survival aren't 100% but it's still pretty good about 90-95%.  They generally require treatment with oxygen and some need feeding tubes.  They can end up without any medical complications but they are more likely to have complications than a full term baby.   Usually the complications they experience are less severe than those for babies born earlier than 28 weeks.|`|AA11537580	80% survival rate at 28 weeks|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No.  They could have lots of health problems at that age including underdeveloped lungs.|`|9979bb6f0e03a8d3d1be61eab96d087daa	It all depends on how well developed the babys organs are, most importantly, the lungs.  The lungs are the last thing to develope and need the longest to mature.   At 28 weeks, unless he is a super-baby, his lungs will not be properly developed and will probably end up in NICO on a CPAP machine.|`|wkd5CMNaaa	A baby born at 28 weeks gestation has about a 91 percent chance of survival|`|QrQWQ1nraa	they could or could not be fine!

HCmAoNjzaa	My suggestion is to spend the money and buy enough Ovulation Predictor Kits to test every day for a month. Keep them and write on them the CD that you took them and at the end of that month you should have a pretty clear view of how long your cycle is, when you ovulate and how long your luteal phase is. You can find OPKs cheap on sites like saveontests.com. This has helped me immensely! <br>  <br>  And the other poster is right, 4 months is not a long time. I started stressing about not getting pregnant after the first month, it has now been 17 months and I really regret being so stressed about it for the first year because I think that maybe if I had just calmed down I would have gotten pregnant naturally before having to take all of the fertility drugs. I just finshed my 5th round of Clomid.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Read "Taking Charge of Your Fertility"- that will tell you everything you need to know.|`|vue9NOhYaa	4 months is NOT a long time to be trying.<br>  <br>  If you understand when you ovulate, and are timing things correctly, then just keep trying.<br>  <br>  If you DON'T understand your fertile times (and there is a lot of misinformation around), then educate yourself so you can time things more accurately.|`|H74F8jxuaa	I would say first off, you should get ovulation predictor kits to see when you are ovulating.  You can have sex all you want and not get pregnant because you have to have sex during your fertile time which is only about 5-6 days a cycle.  I have started using the clearblue fertility monitor and I know several days in advance when I am going to ovulate.  I highly recommend buying a fertility monitor and  you can get one on ebay new or used for a very good price and most of the time, they even come with the test sticks.  One pill that you should be taking, although it won't increase your fertility, is prenatal pills with folic acid.  You need folic acid in order to help with having a healthy baby with no neuro problems.  I have heard Taking Charge of Your Fertility is a good book to read.  I haven't read it, but I have done a lot of research as I have been trying for 6 months, but planning for 12.<br>  You need to know what your fertile signs are and what to look for.  When you are fertile, you are slick and wet down there.  When you wipe, it is clear and stretchy (you have to get some between two fingers to see if it is stretchy).  You will have an increased sex drive, and many other signs.  The internet has a lot of good information that I can't write down because it would take all day.  Here are some good websites to go to for answers you are looking for:
kyqhMuSiaa	Completely normal.. Don't worry it will happen just like that. Baby will drop and labor will start.

You don't have to be diolated to go into labor. From my own experience (3 kids) when you go into labor you fully diolate to 10 centimeters. When I was pregnant my doctor gave me a pregnancy handbook called "what to expect when you're expecting" it was my "bible" every question you can think of is answered. I strongly suggest that you're next pregnancy (if youre planning one yet lol) you pick up a copy of it. I used the book all 3 pregnancies.

Your best bet is to be 100% honest with your mother. I hope that one day my daughters can talk to me about those things because I would rather them be safe than end up pregnant at a young age. I can teach them all I want about not having sex until they are married and hope that I teach them right, but if they want to have sex, they are going to regardless of what I tell them.|`|eJDfkqmkaa	in mississippi you can go to the health department and they will give it to you for free and wont contact your parents. im sure that it is the same wherever you live|`|HuGNlw2naa	same problem here|`|1h9DYByQaa	your mum has to understand that one day wether she knows now or later that you will have sex, wouldnt it be better that she support your descion in going on the birth control to avoid becoming a teenage parent..than saying no and it happening...i think you are showing that you are being responsible in wanting to and protecting yourself...<br>  <br>  you sound very grown up i am sure that you will find a way to talk to your mum, <br>  <br>  btw...i am pretty sure in the uk, at 16 you can see a doctor by yourself and they are bound by confidentislity not to tell your parents. <br>  <br>  good luck
2nfMSDiPaa	Cervical fluid is the mucus that is secreted from the cervix. It is produced by the hormone estrogen in the first phase of a monthly cycle. Cervical fluid is an essential element to conception due to its ability to keep sperm alive for up to five days (in fertile quality fluid), protects it from the acidity in the vagina and transports the sperm to the outer third wall of the fallopian tube where fertilization takes place.<br>  <br>  What does cervical fluid look like?<br>  Cervical fluid will range in abundance, consistency, color and fertile quality due to the increasing level of estrogen within the first phase of your cycle. Typically the changes in fluid will fall into the following pattern.<br>  <br>  Dry or light moisture - infertile<br>  after menstruation for a period of 3 - 5 days you may experience no fluid at all or a small amount of moisture. Color of any existing fluid is clear or slightly white but will dry immediately on your fingertips. Overall sensation is not wet at this time.<br>  <br>  Sticky or gummy - infertile<br>  cervical fluid then changes to feeling sticky for a period of 2 - 3 days. When rubbed between your fingertips it may give a small amount of resistance, feels slightly gummy or may even crumble. The color will range from clear to white and although you may feel a small amount of moisture the fluid is still dry and does not feel wet at this time.<br>  <br>  Creamy, milky, lotion like - fertile<br>  cervical fluid now becomes much more abundant and will feel wet from 2 - 4 days. It can appear either thick and creamy or like hand lotion and will form peaks in your fingertips when pulled apart or can be thinner and look milky. Color of the fluid is white or yellow and the overall vaginal sensation is wet.<br>  <br>  Egg white cervical fluid - very fertile<br>  cervical fluid now reaches its most fertile stage for 1 - 5 days. The fluid will look and have the consistency of eggwhites. It is slippery to the touch and if pulled between the fingertips will stretch 1 - 10 inches! The color can be clear or iridescent and the overall sensation is extremely wet.<br>  <br>  Dry, moist or sticky - infertile<br>  cervical fluid will now change drastically due to the drop in estrogen and the surge of progesterone following ovulation. It can be dry, watery, moist or sticky and will remain in that stage until the end of your monthly cycle - which is the day before your menstrual period begins. Any fluid at all will dry up quickly upon your fingertips, can range from no color to white and your overall vaginal sensation will be dry at this time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!Goodluck...billions of baby dust to you!!<br>  <br>  Take care|`|mx3gFmIKaa	Yeah it could be a problem, and I had it.  Clomid tends to make the CM hostile and that is why many clomid users including myself were successful taking an OTC med to thin secretions like robitussin or mucinex a few days before ovulation.  I did 9 rounds of clomid, my first round with adding robitussin it worked.  Some of it depends on DH's motility too.  Ask your doc about what he/she thinks about adding something to thin secretions if you aren't BFP this month, good luck|`|Er3imE5Yaa	heres wishing you all the luck i can give!  Hope this month is your month!<br>  <br>  LOTS AND LOTS OF STICKY BABY DUST TO YOU!|`|c7f419243c5a31e1118c95c6e72ce929aa	It may be just from the rounds of Clomid you did. Try taking Robitussin around the time you know you're going to ovulate, this will help cervical mucus become snottier for lack of a better term. Also you can use such products as Pre-Seed during intercourse to help with lubrication and conception. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good luck and lots of baby dust!|`|E6obQSpraa	Try robitussin cough medicine to help thin it out. I tried it this month and it worked for me, but it made me produce less of it (!) so not sure if this is effective or not, but it did thin it out.  Take it 4 days before ovulation and up to 2 days after.<br>  <br>  Good Luck xxx|`|b68259ab3cc29378d8615fc228f4b78caa	creamy ???That's exactly what you want!<br>  EWCM is extrememly important when TTC|`|aSF6kUcWaa	creamt fluid should help : )  (as long as the creaminess is not a yucky yeast infection)
Er3imE5Yaa	Sore breasts is a symptom for pregnancy but it also is a sign that af is coming.  It usually takes up to a year for a healthy couple to get pregnant.  So if you dont this month, keep your head up and try again next month!<br>  <br>  BUT FOR NOW HERES HOPING THAT THIS IS YOUR MONTH!!!!<br>  <br>  LOTS OF BABY DUST TO YOU!|`|S8Qpiabdaa	mabey mabey not it is one of my sure signs but u never know do u feel sleepy or nauseous?|`|R8qooymyaa	It could be a symptom, although symptoms don't always come when you expect them to eg before your period, i am due af on saturday and had my bfp yesterday, and i had no symptoms, apart from itchy boobs which are now sore nipples today, and then this evening i had a centimetre of blood when i wiped which is implantation. so you don't always have to have symptoms, all the other months i thought i had loads of symptoms and af come.<br>  <br>  Good luck hun xx|`|we9sS2tNaa	sore breast could be pregnancy or pms...just have to wait and see if your aunt comes to visit...if not I got a tip...try having a orgasm together some docs say when you have one your cervix opens up to contract and it allows more semen in :)<br>  <br>  Good luck
CTFlCypmaa	I am 8 weeks pregnant with twins.  My doctor said yesterday that my uterus is def large right now and will continue to grow even more.  I am 5'1 and have an average body size.  I have a slight bumb and just today one of the other teachers was like wow you are showing!   I would say if you did not know I was preg you would not now that I was but if  you knew I was you would see something.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	The odds of having twins if they run in your family are 1 in 17.<br>  <br>  All my friends that have carried twins looked very pregnant by 10 weeks,|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	I am going to guess 12 weeks. I start to show at 3 months, and that is with a singleton
Wtyk7086aa	High possibilty. Take a pregnancy test, if its positive or even negative, still go to the doctor. Before it's too late, so you can have options.|`|p3d3E75oaa	umm yeah you just went to far or hard|`|lTsPX04jaa	if you were pregnant then your still pregnant|`|aDQgLEbuaa	If you were pregnant before, then you're probably still pregnant.|`|ixy3memMaa	Yes, there is. You probably just scratched yourself or something... pretty badly from the sound of it.
UbCzA2JVaa	I love that name! I also like Rowan for a girl. Anyway it doesn't matter if people don't like it, it is you who makes the ultimate decision anyway! I love the name Kierce for a girl, and a lot of people don't like it, but I still love it!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|AA11138222	I like Elijah Rowan OR Elijah Alexander...both middle names together make the name way too long.<br>  <br>  I prefer Rowan for a boy, if at all. I'd probably only consider it as a middle name myself.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I honestly like it. I think it's great.<br>  Elijah is nice, Rowan is great for a BOY (to answer your other question, no, not for a girl ever), and I love Alexander, it's classic and cool.<br>  <br>  I prefer Rowan as a first name over Elijah, maybe<br>  Rowan Alexander<br>  or<br>  Rowan Elijah Alexander?<br>  <br>  I don't know.<br>  I love all of the names though, honestly|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Assuming Alexander would be the last name, I think it's a great name - a good blend of traditional and contemporary. I don't really care for Rowan for a girl...it just seems like a very, very masculine name.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	I do like the name Elijah but I'm not too thrilled with Rowan, for a boy or girl.  Just my opinion.  I say name your child whatever you like though.|`|EFzXvfbQaa	I love it.Its a very Strong name.GO FOR IT!Rowan.hhmmm..i liikee iit for both a boy and a girl|`|bge945ytaa	I really like the name, but I don't like Rowan as a girl's name.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I like the name Elijah Rowan Alexander. It's cute. You could call him Elijah or Eli.. :D And I don't really like the name Rowan for a girl...I think it's a very masculine name! But I met a little girl name Rowan a couple years ago & she was very cute. I think Rowan Marie is a cute name|`|f3nGD71laa	I have always loved the names Rowan and Alexander. Particularly if the Rowan is a girl. I used to love Elijah, until my mother always talked about naming my little sisters Elijah if they were boys. That doesn't mean it's not cute.|`|AA11659320	as long as u like it who cares what anyone else thinks.  remember though this chils has it for the rest of their life.  in this world people worry too much on others opinions but who really cares at the end of the day. its your life your child!!!|`|1U3kSuhsaa	i think it's an AWESOME name!  when i think of that name, it reminds me of a handsome prince, or an extremely hot dude, or even a well mannered little boy (lol idk why though...) and rowan for a girl...not so much.|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	I think it's a very handsome name.  How can they not like it?  The only name that's not traditional is Rowan, but it's a good strong nature name.<br>  <br>  Rowan isn't too bad on a girl, but I'd go for Rowena.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	Rowan Alexander is okay. As is Elija Rowan. Three's a crowd. :]|`|9mLGFqdxaa	Yes, i like it alot. i love the name Elijah. Elijah Rowan Alexander is SO cute!!|`|KrKtELAvaa	I don't know how I personally feel about Rowan for a girl, but if you like it go for it! I do however think that Rowan Elijah Alexander sounds better then what you have....but that's a personal opinion!|`|bApqdmC0aa	i always hated elijah. when i was younger there was this show the wild thornberries and the girl's name was eliza, and it ryhmes. i like rowan. on a girl.............|`|EiSq36a2aa	No. Honest opinion is no.|`|md9rI5Y6aa	i like it...how would you pronounce rowan?
HPRlEWu1aa	yes i had it at 12 weeks exacly i started bleeding and went to the ER .. after multiple visits to the OB i got sent for a level2 u/s and they found out i have a subchorionic hematoma .. its a bloodclot between the placenta and uterine wall ( thats where mine was) it eventually bled out .. ive been on bed rest since week 12 .. im 15w3d today and going back to work tomorrow .. i stopped spotting abd bleeding last week .. thank god! i even went out and bought a doppler just to ease my mind .<br>  almost all pregnancies carry out to full term when women experience this ... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.justmommies.com/articles/subchorionic-hematoma.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.justmommies.com/articles/subc...</a> <br>  <br>  heres a lil more info on it <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mothering.com/discussions/showthread.php?t=796121" rel="nofollow">http://www.mothering.com/discussions/sho...</a><br>  <br>  and heres a support group <br>  <br>  theres many support groups out there .. just look for em|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I also think everything happens for a reason, sort of - more that perhaps if the pregnancy ends that perhaps it should.   Perhaps there was a second embryo developing that miscarried early, but the healthy one is fine.   The link below indicates that often in the 1st trimester such a subchrioinic hemorrhage ending in spontaneous abortion depends on your age, the size of the hemotoma, and the position.   The figures are mostly positive though.
BBfIXcI0aa	Go with something simple and monosyllabic. <br>  LelaElaine Jo Cannon would be my first pick, but Beth or Leigh or anything along those lines would work, too.|`|AA11138222	Are you going to hyphenate the first name, or spell it just like that? It looks like a typo, or like you just squished two names together. Couldn't you just name her Lela Elaine Cannon, and call her Lela Elaine? Lots of people go by both their first and middle name.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Why not use Elaine as the middle name instead? Lela Elaine Cannon.<br>  <br>  LelaElaine is a bit much as one whole name.. it runs together because of the vowels before and after both L's.|`|bHI4NLonaa	Why would you give your daughter a combo name like that for a first name? It sounds completely contrived and incredibly stupid. Unless you are southern US royalty, leave the belle names alone. Please don't do this.<br>  <br>  EDIT: well go with Lilliana, that is is very nice, beautiful name. I vote for that.|`|XF9XNvrjaa	I like lillianna Mae Cannon. I think it all flows very well.<br>  Or LelaElaine Bell Cannon.|`|1U3kSuhsaa	carmen sounds like it would fit nicely <3|`|HMPdnhApaa	If I were going to use LelaElaine or any combination name I would not use a middle name at all. It would sound too much of a mouthful.
b85nVIzoaa	Hi there, hot tea with honey is good but hot honey and lemon is better. It's all natural and won't hurt you or the baby. I just had a baby myself and that's what helped me when I had sore throats and lost my voice. Also, if you add a clove to it, it makes it taste a bit nicer. Hope this helps|`|7NLGPESiaa	I use warm water and salt to gargle and spit back out. This also helps with toothaches.
R8qooymyaa	Yeah i think its totally normal, i got my bfp yesterday, it was really faint but it was there, but today it was lighter but likte you i had had fruit and had a drink, so it would have diluted it, Hcg doubles every 48 hours i think so if your worried test in a few days and it should be darker, But congrates!!!! wooo!!! x|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	Because you drank juice/water ect with the 2nd test you diluted your urine, thats why the line was lighter. You should always test with your first morning wee cause it has been sitting for a long time while you were sleeping and is the most pure when you first go to the toilet in the morning. Congrates you are having a baby!!!!|`|Y2WMKpHjaa	congrats!|`|tUpvQbwGaa	I would just go get blood work to double check. but in the mean time relax And Congrats|`|WMFaQpJoaa	i would say it is just beccause ur pee mose morediluded-from the juice and water. as long as it still says positive i wouldnt worry. CONGRATS! ! ! ! ! !|`|we9sS2tNaa	You are Pregnant!...even if the line was light it doesn't matter the test detects a hormone (HCG) that only pregnant women produce. Go see your doctor asap.<br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|ec20340954300949b5d60c056689dd33aa	Nope, not at all! Congrats!!|`|S8Qpiabdaa	go to the doctor ur probley prgo
DzlOVHkzaa	If you mean 2.9 pounds to 4.1 pounds then Yes. <br>  <br>  The N.I.C.U. increases or fortifies your milk with extra nutrients and calories to reach between 22 to 26 calories per ounce or if your baby is on formula will feed him/her a formula such as Neosure which is 24 calories per Ounce. This makes the baby gain 2 to 3 ounces a day.<br>  <br>  My son took longer to gain weight because he could not handle the  fortification or any type of formula so hhe only got straight breast milk which is only 20 calories per ounce.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son went from 6.6 to 11 pounds in 7 days, so I think yes.
O97ZoHGXaa	i don't understand why you need help. pregnancy is a 38-42 week journey (normally)<br>  just be excited and happy, not trying to rush the pour thing out.<br>  he/she will come when they're ready.<br>  if she is very uncomfortable then try lots of walking. that's normally the think that is most encouraged..<br>  best of luck x|`|nfLyS1toaa	sorry but you must wait till it is time. you can take her walking at the park. you sound like you will be a good father since you cant wait for your baby to be here. congrats|`|fQ7nIwVqaa	i wouldnt recommend sex, u mite cause an infection of the babys membranes + dicomfort to the mother.<br>  just make her walk slowly, whtever she can manage.<br>  i think the baby wil come soon.<br>  dont hurry it. let the baby take its time.|`|0MUvGlHkaa	nope her body will become ready when bubs is as labor can be such an erractic time table no one knows till see goes into full on labor i wish you both well. he/she will come when ready but try lots of walking gravity will help push baby head down into birth canal.|`|2f187fd461b7b57957cd504ae18cee8eaa	I've heard cod liver oil will do the trick.. I also had a coworker tell me swinging on swing works.  But these are just wives-tales.|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	Not really.  There is no proven method to bring on labor.  A lot of walking might help.|`|SFNXSLumaa	be patient. The baby will come soon. I was 42 weeks and induced, so I have no sympathy ;) It won't be long now though! Do things to get your mind off it, go for a walk, go for a meal, play scrabble. If you want old wives tales, then drive on a bumpy road, have sex, eat spicy food......|`|xGlqXMRAaa	Sex its very effective, in fact thats what doctors typically recommend.  Also eating spicy foods, walking long distances, eating pineapple, raspberry leaf tea, castor oil. Try those|`|C8wg1uyhaa	lots of hot spicy foods,walking and sex all help bring on labour.I tried them to bring on my labour and either it worked or it was a major coincidence|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	She probably wont like this, but sex. Sperm has prostaglandin in it which could help make the cervix more ripe. So lots of ejaculation|`|z8YGEk0qaa	I hear some things that really help speed up labor is sex, lots of it and walking.....she should be moving around to induce herself...try these...good luck|`|XaysYqriaa	ask your doctor to induce just as long as the babies lungs are completely formed.
4t4S5kLkaa	its hard to guess the day i was due on my period i was still cramping quite bad but never came on so took test couple of days after n was pregnant the next couple of days though my stomach did feel different i say just take a test anyway n no need for expensive ones mine was cheap n didn't lie lol|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Maybe. Take a test. Being 3 days late isn't all that late so you could just be late...|`|0cZeXMdnaa	i dont think you are. in december i missed my period but i wasnt pregnant i just had two periods in january to make up for decembers missed period. i asked my dr. and he said its normal for girls to miss it sometimes
PQw92IGHaa	You need to determine the length of your cycle.  The first day of your period is considered your Cycle Day 1.  You typically ovulate during the middle of your cycle, meaning if you have a 28 day cycle then you should ovulate on day 14.  If your periods are irregular you will have to take the average of your days over about a 3 month span and see where you ovulation falls.  Also, check your cervical mucous.  When it gets to an egg white consistency you are around your ovulation time!<br>  <br>  Good luck!  If you really want to pinpoint ovulation you can try and Ovulation Predictor Kit.|`|QB5D0rG4aa	2 weeks before your period starts|`|tUpvQbwGaa	Best way to make sure your cover have sex either every other day or every day on day five of your cycle until about the 20th.sperm can live in you up 2 3 days at a time but you want to make sure its in there all the time. to get ur chance's up|`|gJ2vPKqsaa	You ovulate 2 weeks before your period starts, so you'll need to track your cycle and figure out how long you go between the first day of one period and the first day of the next.  Most women will ovulate 2-3 weeks after the first day of a period, but the egg can only be fertilized over about a 2 day span.  It's debated, but sperm can live inside a woman for several days, maybe even up to a week.|`|a1uoxczTaa	use this fertility predictor <br>  <a href="http://www.parents.com/app/fertilitypredictor/?sssdmh=dm17.362024&esrc=nwpc&email=holidaeshawty@yahoo.com&_requestid=174614" rel="nofollow">http://www.parents.com/app/fertilitypred...</a><br>  u can also use a free trial from fertilityfriend.com<br>  if u have a 28 day cycle, most likely you will ovulate around the 14th day. if you don't know your days, try having sex every other day or at least 2-3 times a week.|`|YrHwZw6zaa	I recommend you to check out this website. It's really useful mymonthlycycles.com, you can check when is the day your going to ovulate this is how I keep track:)|`|we9sS2tNaa	If you have a normal 28 day cycle just count 14 days after your period began. You can get pregnant anytime of the month just have fun and don't stress do "IT" like evrey other day and it will happen. Sperm can live in the body for up to 3 days and you only ovulate once a month and the egg stays in the tube waiting for a sperm for about 12-24 hours. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VL8e3E4zaa	Whenever the end of your last period is it's roughly TWO WEEKS after and TWO WEEKS before the next period that you can concieve (So bang in the middle).. Give or take a few days either side of the two week marker.. Have plenty of sex. Hope that helps.. Good Luck!|`|yrA9LLt5aa	About 14 days after your period

I also have the tight feeling, like I do a hundred sit ups a day. Good luck and much baby dust!!!!|`|jLf2Lbbcaa	honestly it sounds like you may just be bloated. you will have to take a test to be sure.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Fatigue is common during PMS and early pregnancy. I dont' really know what you mean about your stomach being tight.|`|iRc3xhubaa	Maybe you had a chemical pregnancy? That would make you feel odd.
kaqPSgTVaa	It's very very very rare but yes, some women can ovulate during their period which could lead to pregnancy.|`|cxnhKTBSaa	Yes, some women do ovulate during their periods.|`|JisXLVSoaa	yes you can|`|0cZeXMdnaa	yea i think so
AvY7Rwvraa	No it doesn't. It hurts a lot. And when you are old enough to experience this part of being human imagine a baby coming out of that area. Its only 10 x worse. Don't have sex until you are ready! And don't get pregnant until you are even more ready!|`|s2JBY0ewaa	my first time was awesome. But I think you should wait. I started at 15 with my current boyfriend... but use protection, trust me!! Because I was pregnant at 16, had my daughter at 17 and graduated HS at 18. Now that im in college its super hard with my baby. So dont do anything right now. Dont be pressured into it either.|`|Wbi1nhHyaa	I think everyone is different but for me it was AGONY even the next 2 days after the insides of my thighs were sore (u no the pain wen youve been excercising without warming up?)

That was a very painful thing for me emotionally and physically.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Nope.  Especially not when I had a full placental abruption with my second son.  Hopefully nothing ever will compair to that.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I'll say getting that darn epidural hurt worse than the contractions! I should have went natural like I had done with my daughter.<br>  <br>  Like you TxMom my first child was stillborn at 26 weeks. Nothing hurt more than physically birthing him and the emotional turmoil afterward.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	When I got pregnant, the father said, not to worry, getting kicked in the (balls) is worse then childbirth. <br>  You can guess what I did to him.|`|j2mRop0laa	Uhm... I don't actually think so but kinda TMI alert: I have had terrible cycle cramps and migraines where I would almost prefer to be in labor.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	only emotional.  nothing physical.  <br>  although i did have sinus surgery and that was painful for days.
buJCtC54aa	i dont believe it will - in moderation of course - my mom craved hot and spicy with me - like hot sauce and similar things - and now i love them too <br>  yes u can have chips! u probally crave the salty crunchiness much away but be sure to eat healty as well -|`|4iXL4C6paa	No, spicy foods can not harm the baby but alot of foods affect you differently when you are pregnant so I would be careful, when I was pregnant with my last child I loved peppers I ate them on everything and then I would end up crying with heartburn, but if you dont have any problems then go ahead and eat.|`|NZid2d1Paa	yeah its definitely fine, you can eat spicy foods, you can eat alot of things except for soft cheeses that arent pasteurized, and eggs that aren't fully cooked. Cause it is easier to get salmonella that way, and you dont want that. Congrats and Good luck.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	No. it will not harm the baby...maybe give you some bad heartburn, but it will not hurt your little one...and potato chips,, i would try and stay away from just because they are not very healthy..at this point you should be eating foods that are healthy for both you and your baby! you feel better when you eat healthier to!!!|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	I'm pretty sure you will be fine with the spicy food<br>  but for the chips<br>  you can still have them<br>  you just have to make sure that you have a lot of healthy food during the day|`|UvliPKIdaa	As far as I've read, there's nothing wrong with eating spicy food...just be aware that it may give you heartburn more easily than before you were preggo.  If you're really worried, here's a link to the babycenter nutrition page.  Lots of helpful info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/eating-well-during-pregnancy" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/eating-well-du...</a><br>  <br>  I also found a link to the same question, answered by a couple of professionals:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe-to-eat-really-spicy-foods-during-pregnancy_1246919.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/406_is-it-safe...</a>|`|fzxiNxGHaa	According to my mum, she ate loads of spicy food because it satisfies me. It stops me from moving about and kicking her. I love spicy food. <br>  <br>  But she was also paranoid and never drank a cup of coffee or tea. Only had loads and loads milk, fish, fruit. Maybe she balanced it out or maybe spicy food isnt harmful to babies.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	You can eat whatever you like, as long as it is non-toxic. Try to stay clear of fish though, because certain kinds have high level or Mercury that can harm the baby.|`|Ed7qNFdzaa	look up 'foods to avoid when pregnant'....potato chips is NOT on the list...but your the 2nd person who's mentioned them in here today!<br>  <br>  spicy food is fine, and actually it will give the baby a sense of the type of diet he or she will eventually be introduced to when eating solids. if your family tends to eat that way.<br>  <br>  me and my dh LOVE spicy, my dh let my 2 year old try his eggs the other morning, with hot sauce on it, and our son said "UMM, want more".<br>  <br>  ;)

Anthony Blake does flow well together.<br>  Noel Gianni - I don't like Noel, it's more of a girl's name and for a girl, I like the spelling Noelle.  I don't like Gianni at all.<br>  Gjon (pronounced John-different language) Matthew - I don't like Gjon, people will always mispronounce it, I'd go with just John if you wanted that.  Never been a fan of matthew.<br>  Vincent Chase - I love this combination.  Vincent and Chase are both cute.<br>  Noah Kenneth - I love the name Noah, always have.  I don't like Kenneth too much.<br>  Tristan Joseph - I am not a fan of Tristan, but, Tristan Joseph does flow well together.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Ava Jade - Beautiful name. I love it.<br>  Leonora Christine - Doesn't really flow. Both names are nice though.<br>  Trinity Christiana - Trinity is trashy. Christiana is lovely.<br>  Antoinetta Danielle - Doesn't flow. I love Danielle.<br>  Avery Grace - Quite nice.<br>  Jocelyn Alessandra - Doesn't flow. Both names are nice. I think Alessandrea Jocelyn flows better.<br>  <br>  Anthony Blake - Great name. I love it.<br>  Noel Gianni - Don't like it really. I love Noel though.<br>  Gjon Matthew - Nice name but I really prefer John. John is a nickname though. Jonathan Matthew/Matthew Jonathan is much better.<br>  Vincent Chase - Flows well. I love Vincent but I hate Chase.<br>  Noah Kenneth - It's nice. I like it.<br>  Tristan Joseph - Nice names. I think Joseph Tristan flows better.|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	Girls:<br>  I like the middle name Grace, but that's it. sorry<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  I like the middle names Matthew and Chase, but that's it. sorry|`|UbCzA2JVaa	The only ones I really like are Ava Jade and Noah Kenneth.

I also like Tristan (for either gender actually) I think Noel is definitely a girl's name though so i would say minus one vote for that name.|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	I like Ava Jade the best. Leanora looks too much like Leonard. Trinity is too tied in to the Matrix. Antoinetta is just a boring name. Avery sounds like a boys name and I love the name Jocelyn but the middle name makes it too long. Try something shorter with Jocelyn.<br>  <br>  I like Noel Gianni, sounds italian and fun. Anthony Blake is ok. Gjon Matthew isn't bad. Vincent Chase sounds stuck up. I've never been a fan of Noah, it sounds too.... soft for a boy. Tristan also sounds a little on the "soft" side.|`|5sYzlAjPaa	love Leonora and Jocelyn.<br>  <br>  love Tristan.|`|XHZtwfuIaa	I like :<br>  Ava Jade<br>  Leaonora Christine<br>  Avery Grace<br>  <br>  Noah Kenneth<br>  Tristan Joseph|`|EFzXvfbQaa	i like Anthony Chase<br>  and<br>  Ava Alessandra

AIrCtDCYaa	I would really ask your doc and put it in God hands|`|vWb8fquvaa	BTW- 2 weeks early does not = preemie. 4 weeks+ is considered a preemie. <br>  <br>  I had my daughter 7 weeks early and my OB told me I have a 40% chance of another. However it depends if there was a known reason for your son's premature birth. There was no real reason for me either.
WPI0Z47saa	Parents need to pay more attention to what their children are doing online. They should also keep the computer in a central location where they can walk by at anytime. The internet can be very dangerous and I don't think some parents take this seriously enough or even realize it.|`|6nUprmu5aa	I'm more sick of people like you, who want to complain about this free service. You can't control what other people do. If they raised the age limit, kids would just lie. We don't need to promote lying. Sometimes they can't ask their parents things. I agree they shouldn't be posting their pictures on here, but saying they shouldn't be allowed just because of you is ridiculous. If you don't like the way this site is go elsewhere.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	I am pretty sure there is an age restriction,but it's not fool proof. All they have to do is lie about their age.  But as far as the questions they ask. Apparently they aren't getting any information from their parents,so where else are they going to go? I mean talking to their equally clueless friends surely won't help anything.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Bad parents who let their kids do that in my opinion|`|YL1evGq3aa	Of course there's an age restriction but they lie so they can ask their dumb questions.|`|wVW7nxSzaa	Yeah, I quess it is getting a little crazy. But anyone can lie aobut their age.|`|AA11210211	There actually is an age restriction it is 13 yr I think,I have wondered this too,I guess their parents are to busy with themselves??|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	They are bored and curious.  I don't think it does any harm.  Well, maybe the picture posting isn't a good idea...  I was on the internet when I was 12 or 13.  Back then it was bulletin boards and mostly local people that I knew in real life though.  My parents probably should have kept a closer eye on me too because I talked about some pretty racy stuff sometimes.
Xmzgk76Taa	I am not sure what your son's middle school is like, but when I started middle school there were kids from 3 different elementary schools...so I made a lot of new friends.  The advice another person gave you of doing the "one year" thing, is a good idea...however...I would hate for your son to decide after a year to go to the other school where you have to pay more money, only to discover his friends have "moved on". Not saying that they wouldn't be friends with him anymore or anything like that, but things change a lot at that age, and a year is a LONG time at that age.  I was best friends with a girl who I met at 3 years old..Once we got to middle school our friendship changed. We remained "acquaitances" but it was never the same.  We both just met so many new people.  I met a new girl who was in my homeroom and we became really close.  22 years later, we are still best friends.  I know it will be hard on your son at first, and he'll want to go where his friends are going, but he will make new ones!  I am a military wife and we have had to move many times...my children are always sad to leave but they make new friends..and you have the luxury of his "old friends" still being close by where they can still hang out after school or on weekends.  I think your son will make a lot of new friends at the new school and you can save the added expense.  He may be angry now, but in a few years he could be thanking you for it...he just may meet some great people he wouldn't have otherwise.<br>  Good luck in whatever you decide.|`|haabfMtkaa	I agree with you he needs to adjust to change and also think about high school he will want to make friends now so he is not alone when he gets there or you will just have to commit to this for the next 7 years no way.<br>  My son just went to a new middle school after last year driving 40 min. to school there and back every day. He was a little worried(as where we) about it but is now doing great he has made new closer friends and will be going to high school with them next year. He will make new friends and be okay.|`|f55619778e2c4f36156e3d1508aa6431aa	Have him spend his first year at the school nearby.   After that school year is over then ask him how he feels about transferring to the other school.   If he made a lot of new friends at his school then it won't matter so much to him.   If I were you I would do the "give a try for the first year" plan.|`|rWoaRdljaa	same thing happened to me in junior high my friends went to a school far from my house and i went to 1 close to my house and i made really awsome friends :D. ones i still know today.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	This really all depends on your finances. If you can swing it,do it. If not,then he will just have to wait and see his friends on the weekends.<br>  Have you considered car pooling? So the bus wouldn't even be a factor?|`|BxpGdVTOaa	It depends on how much money you have...but I would send him to the closer school. Middle school is a change anyway, and it is safer for him to be closer to home. That way, in an emergency you can get to him, or if he is sick or hurt you know about it sooner. Also, if he goes to the closer school he will make new friends, ones who probably live closer too.<br>  Also, 500 is A LOT of money, especially every year... A thousand, two thousand dollars that could be paying for his college...<br>  Is the other school better? Or just another public school?
v2eyd0ldaa	I like Reese for a girl its really sweet but sounds lovely with Leia too.<br>  I would definately call my baby girl Leia Reese, thats so pretty. x|`|nZVmkZSBaa	1. Do you like the name Reese for a girl? Hmm... It's okay. However, I prefer the name Reece, and for a boy. It's not completely terrible though.<br>  2. What are good middle names for Reese? I like Reese Isabella, Reese Victoria, Reese Gianna, Reese Dorothy, Reese Daphne, Reese Caralyn, Reese Jannelle, Reese Marielle, Reese Jelina, Reese Katalina, Reese Maci, and Reese Lindsey. I much rather Reese as a middle name though.<br>  3. Do you like Leia Reese? Eh, it's okayy. I prefer Leah Reese though. I also like Linley Reese, Kaylen Reese, Kyler Reese, Kylie Reese, Jordan Reese, Addison Reese, Margaret Reese and Adelaide Reese.|`|zdSRsySNaa	Reese could work although it's rather unusual for girls. You've got the Welsh boys name Rhys/Reece. It could work though. Except you might get mistaken for an American - they seem to use boys' names for girls all the time, Jamie, Courtney, Hayden, etc. Of course they use them for boys as well just to make things even more confusing. <br>  <br>  Leia's great name but with that spelling it's got Star Wars written all over it. You'll have to ask yourself if you think it's right to force your child to live with that before she's even old enough to say her own name. Leah or Lia would work just as well. Or even Leigh (not Lee - that's a boy's name - oh never mind....)<br>  <br>  If you're going to go with Reese though I've thought of some middle names you might like.<br>  <br>  Reese Elizabeth<br>  Reese Charlotte<br>  Reese Catherine<br>  Reese Lightening<br>  Reese Eleanor<br>  Reese Linda<br>  Reese Astrud<br>  Reese Emily<br>  <br>  <br>  As a musician I've often wondered about naming my first son after the inventor of the saxophone. But I don't think my Jewish mother would ever forgive me...|`|iMaTMWMxaa	It depends which country you're in. I would say in the UK, that Reese is a boys name, as I have never heard it as a girls name. Not that I'm the only person in the UK of course :)<br>  <br>  I like Leia Reese though, very pretty.|`|XHZtwfuIaa	I like Reese for a girl.<br>  Reese Catherine<br>  Reese Amelia<br>  Reese Abigail<br>  Reese Elizabeth<br>  <br>  Leia Reese is also very pretty but I like Reese more.|`|UquxJBwVaa	i think its a cute name for a girl thats not vey common. <br>  reese elizabeth<br>  reese katherine<br>  reese lynn <br>  reese nicole <br>  reese monica <br>  reese leia <br>  but leia reese is cute too. <br>  <br>  good luck. <br>  && sorry i wasnt much help. lol|`|bnblT0l0aa	Leia is pronounced Layah, right?

0tFQVe6Laa	I would consult you're doctor to make sure, but from my experience its probably stretching of the muscles and ligements from the baby growing. Ive had pains like that in all three of my pregnancies.|`|XaysYqriaa	if it is like a stabbing pain near your ribs it is just the baby kicking or stretching and it is normal get use to it.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Does it run up and down your leg, almost like a charlie horse (if you know what that is) or a prickly needle feeling going down your legs, almost to your foot? I have that too, and I'm almost 30 weeks pregnant. It started for me at about 25 weeks, my OB said it was my sciatic nerve. There's not much you can do about it, just take some tylenol, walk it off (excersing or stretching that area out a little while laying in bed has helped me a lot), and hope it goes away. I HATE it though, my last OB appointment, I was walking out with a limp because every time I put weight on my left side, the pain would just shoot up my entire left side of my body. :(|`|H2IhRXIIaa	I had the same thing, and was told by everyone it was 100% normal..or it was the baby..ect. So nothing was done..it happened alot when I walked..like even to a trip to wal mart it killed me! Well finally I could not take it anymore and went to the ER. Turns out it was a kidney infection! Because it started out as a bladder infection but I had no signs of therefor went un treated. Then I was never checked for the pain I had, I was just told it was normal..so it gave it more time to get worse..So most deff get it checked asap. And good luck it isnt fun!|`|BilLTGLFaa	It could be your Gallbladder. I have gallstones and have had them since before I got pregnant. Your gallbladder is on your right side, just under your ribcage, and the pain can radiate to your back, and sometimes into your neck and shoulders. I would definitely tell your OB the next time you feel this pain, she will probably send your for an anatomy scan like I had to confirm or rule out Gallstones. Until then, try to stay away from anything too greasy or fried, or spicy. Good Luck!|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	I had the same problem, except on my left side because I have anterior placenta.  I called my doctor and they told me it was round ligament pain.  It won't go away completely but they told me to put heat on it to help or to take ibuprofren (YES, it is safe until 26 weeks---your third trimester).|`|S21940Fkaa	It could just be the baby's position, pressing on a nerve or something.  You know you can move your baby around. Just palm your hands around him/her and move from side to side until he/she repositions.  Try sleeping on the side that doesn't hurt to relieve the pressure.  Good luck, there's more to come...|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Sounds like it could be your sciatica nerve. Check it on line. Very common in pregnancy
43NzMYZtaa	She could be, since you had unprotected sex, but her having headaches and stomach pains is not a sign of pregnancy; it hasn't been long enough. most likely, these are symptoms of her anxiety that she may be pregnant. she should take a test to put her mind at ease.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|FbPbRIsPaa	Plan b has to be taken within 5 days to be effective.  So I would say its cutting it close  She would not be having symptoms after 5 days,  after a few weeks maybe but not likely.   wait 2 weeks and have her take a test if it comes back negative and she still has that "feeling"  she should take another one in a week to be sure|`|s2JBY0ewaa	When I was pregnant I didnt feel a thing only till i was 6weeks. Sometimes pills dont work, i say that from personal experience. I dont think she's pregnant. but you never know. I think its best to take a pregancy test. Just wait a few more days.|`|AIrCtDCYaa	Go to doc asap|`|CVii94hnaa	Her symptoms are most likely from the large amounts of hormones in the plan B pill. I wouldn't think she was pregnant but if the complaints don't go away in a few days I would go see a dr.|`|TMuxrQfdaa	Only will work the best within 24 hours. Get prego kit from drug store and hope its not blue.|`|8IrIYPBAaa	she could be..have her go to the doc...
WPI0Z47saa	It is wrong for people to judge others on something so personal as this.|`|AA11210211	I don't like it,I'll leave it at that.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	I think it's fantastic!|`|7Io72XtQaa	I have always said that I wouldn't have an abortion as I didn't agree with them. However sometimes it is for the best. When I fell pregnant I was 19 and it was an option that I considered to begin with. Its a very hard decision to make. It is up to the woman herself and no one should be able to force her to keep a baby if she doesn't want it. I think if the circumstances are bad then abortion is the right option.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I have heard enough questions like this to last me a lifetime|`|LAGM6I2vaa	I am pro-choice.But that dose not mean that I would ever get one.It would all depend on my situation at the time.I have a friend that got a abortion because she was date raped and got pregnant.I do not think any less of her because of it.She was not ready for a child,could not support one, and her body was up to enduring the pregnancy so it was in the best interest for her and the baby to aboard.But the main reason I believe this way is that I think that the woman should have the right to make the decision for her self.I don't think that the Gov. should make that decision for women.But that is my opinion and only mine.|`|H5qJPekAaa	It depends on the situation. If you have gotten raped and now your are prego from it. Then I say ok. But if it is because you had sex with out protection or your not ready for a baby yet. Then I say you should have the baby then get it adopted. It was your fault that you didn't plan better and stuff so now do something right for you and your baby. But in any situation I think that woman should have the right to choose. Were the ones with the baby under our shirt not the father or anyone else around us. So we should be the ones to decide that and have the right to do so.|`|627pWyVkaa	You clearly dont know anything about abortion if thats what you think an abortion is. There are two kinds of abortion and one isnt surgical It is a medication. OR chemical abortion. And they do not cut the baby up inside of you unless you are very far along, and In most of the times they Do not preform abortions if you are that far along. <br>  Abortion is a personal choice for any woman. Im glad they have that option for woman out there. IF you don't like them or think there cruel Then Dont ever have one. Why does it matter what people think about them! Everyone has opinions about everything. and everyone is intitled to there opinion, doesnt mean it makes anyones right.|`|k2heQRKFaa	you know this is just gonna start a huge debate and a fight or was that your point???<br>  <br>  <br>  i say if you dont believe in abortions then dont have one|`|POzCKBzvaa	I doubt there's anyone who thinks abortion is fun and games. Nonetheless it can sometimes be necessary for the survival of the mother. I feel that it is a respectable choice when a woman has been raped. However, I don't think it should be used as a method of birth control.<br>  Having said that, there are so many children these days who do not have stable homes or that have homes and parents that are detrimental to the child's health that you sometimes wonder if a woman bearing a child that they can not support is better for the child.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, in my opinion, is that making abortion illegal would not stop abortions from happening. Instead of being performed by competent doctors in a sterile environment, women would resort to having "coat hanger" abortions in some back alley. <br>  Ideally there would be stricter regulations concerning abortion but I'm not sure how that could be regulated.|`|207dFmdHaa	I feel that it is no ones business except the mothers, I dont even think we should talk about it, it will be between the mother and GOD, it should be her decision only, one made that I wish no one needed to know except her....everyone can have their opinions, but the bottom line is, it is her decision....I dont believe in abortion, but I will fight for someone to get one.....|`|RV3oeESvaa	<a href="http://prolife.com/" rel="nofollow">http://prolife.com/</a>|`|u7LSohRyaa	I definitely think it's terrible too.

Not to mention that babies 1 1/2 months and older feel pain, its not their fault. I don't see the point in abortion because there is the safe haven law (in which you can leave your baby at a police station or fire department and no questions will be asked) there's adoption, and so many couples who can't have kids of their own..I mean even if it's a rape..I don't think murder is the right choice.

There is your "pro-choice"! You don't want a baby? Don't have sex! Easy peasy! Problem solved. Why does YOUR mistake give you the right to kill a human being? <br>  <br>  So let's say you have sex. You get pregnant. You don't want the baby. I definitely don't think you should be forced to keep the child. Especially if you don't have the ability to care for a baby. Put him or her up for adoption! Seriously? It is nine months! You can deal with being pregnant for nine months! I'm pretty sure that your reputation being ruined isn't a good enough reason to kill a baby! So many people are unable to have children. So why kill a child that would be cherished by someone else?<br>  <br>  So a lot of people don't think that a growing fetus is a person. It is! Let's say a baby is born at 6 months gestation. Would it be okay to kill him after he was born? Most people would say no. But a child at the same stage of development that has not been born yet could be aborted. That is completely illogical. The idea that a fetus isn't a life doesn't make any sense when you look at it that way!<br>  <br>  Rape is often an exuse for abortion. But two wrongs don't make a right! I still don't agree with it, but I supose an abortion in this situation could be legal. Another exuse it that the child poses a health risk to the mother. Another valid reason. But these reasons only amount to 1% of the abortions that are done. So why do the other 99% of women feel like it's okay to abort the child? They made their choice!|`|WZQKevt8aa	I don't think this is the section to talk about this.

And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we must persuade her with love, and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even his life to love us. So the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love - that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts. By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. And by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. That is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.

He is 2 years old though so I have a few more choices for protein. He loves peanut butter, so I'll give him peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, celery with some pb on it or apples that he dips into pb. He loves those. I would ask you ped what things that you can give her so that she can get the protein that she needs. Good luck!!|`|Q7lvSU03aa	My daughter didn't like meat at first either.  I then tried hiding it with lots of other veggies in a puree.  She couldn't tell it was in there and now has no problems.<br>  <br>  There are ways to add iron besides meat.  Look at my article below for the list - but basically fortified oatmeal, certain veggies, and legumes like lentils.<br>  <br>  Don't give up, especially when it is mixed in with other stuff.

I'm a nurse in 2 countries and docter in 3 countries lol (I travel  a lot!) So I say its ok! Theres hundreds of children who don't eat meat and most times its ok and some times its not.

I would suggest peanut butter to give to her lol and some carrot juice, any other thing that healthy! Apple juice? Orange juice?

627pWyVkaa	You can always get pregnant even if you took your birth control like clock work everyday. So thats really irresponsible logic of you to think "im untouchable" sort of. Since you dont want a baby then you should take your birth control regularly. A woman if the right circumstances happen, and is under 30 Has about 15-25% chance a month to get pregnant. So You may have just been very lucky before hand. But everyones luck runs out. Home pregnancy tests can be wrong, If it is too soon To test. Just because you were late. You werent late for your period because most woman do not have a period 21 days naturally unless they are on birth control. And even then that isnt your 'period" its a withdrawl bleed from your body withdrawing from the absence of the hormones, That is why 7 days later you start them again so your body cant ovulate and concieve. Since you went off your birht control for a month ish, You more then likely ovulated some point this month, But your body may take a while to realize you werent on the hormones anymore. USually when ever i have abrupltly stopped birth control I would get spotting and then a lot of bleeding, Since my body then is trying to get back to normal. Since you havent bleed yet, I would say there is a HIGh chance you are pregnant. You can take those tests 5 days before missed periods however there most effective teh day After you miss your period. I would wait a week take another test. And No you wouldnt have any symptoms yet. especially if its not showing up on a test just yet. usually 4-5 weeks pregnant you may experience, cramping, any symptoms that could also be classified under menstral pains, and symptoms! If you want to know asap Get a blood test they can tell way before HPT can!|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It's possible you could have gotten a false negative. You MIGHT be showing symptoms, some women don't ever get any, some women get them all at just 3 weeks. It varies. You should however start using a rubber.

When I was sixteen, he came over to do my hair, and my dad made fun of him and threw him out of the house. While I can forgive because I'm an adult, I will never forget that experience, and I will never trust my father to be kind to people I care about or respond appropriately to anyone different again.<br>  <br>  If you're restricting your daughter to friends who are morally righteous, then you're going to have to lock her in a closet by her lonesome, because there's no such thing - "for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God". If we're going with the Christian religious tradition, Jesus constantly hung out with "abominations." You can keep her from hanging out with them by telling her "no" and punishing her when she disobeys, but know that when you choose that path, you're cutting yourself off from her and setting her up to hide more and more of her life from you in the future.<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is, gay men are great companions for young women. They offer a chance to become comfortable with masculinity without any sort of threat, and they usually treat women the way all men should - with respect and affection. Whether your daughter's friend is straight or not doesn't change the fact that, by having a very positive relationship with a guy, she will form expectations of future relationships with guys that demand she be treated appropriately. The only "sin" a homosexual practices is physical romantic involvement with members of the same sex, and as I doubt he's doing that in front of your daughter or talking about it with her, I think she's fine. (Besides, homosexuality isn't contagious.)<br>  <br>  Moral standards are important, and the most important moral standard of all is that of love. Rather than hurting your daughter by ripping away a friend in a way that could have serious ramifications for her relationship with you and her view of religion in the future, I would use this relationship as a teachable moment - it's possible to disagree with someone's lifestyle choices and still love them well.|`|WGAFP6mSaa	Whoa, your a horrible parent.

So I think that's as best as you can do, it's not fair for you to be able to pick your daughter's friends. Other than not being able to come into your house, you can't do much else; she'll find other ways to hang around with him.

She could be gay and bringing home a girlfriend.|`|p5Rpk9Y3aa	Wow.<br>  You can't keep her away from gays.<br>  Why is it such a big deal that she hangs out with him?<br>  There's nothing wrong with her being friends with him.|`|X7DKFr04aa	You cant stop her.  She can be friends with whoever she wants.  You should stop being so paranoid and judgmental because nothing is wrong with being gay.|`|LY8oJfnoaa	You awful person, whats wrong with being gay you evil little cockroach.

I'm in my own custody battles right now for the same thing...only I'm not keeping my son from him and he says I am.....|`|ubo0HWtVaa	the courts need to be involved and they will restrict her rights if she continues this. make sure you document everything and get in contact with the courts.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	If your visition is court ordered such as you have her every other weekend or whatever you can show up with the court order and a police officer and she has to turn her over to you.
