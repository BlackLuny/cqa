6JcodrClaa	Not really...    But both are very good-looking people...|`|92iuiuZKaa	I don't think so..|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	No, not really.|`|eFjcgztZaa	Maybe some of them, but in fact Colombians are very diverse and may look like plenty of other nations, Blacks,Middle-Easterners, Europeans,etc...  And Turkish people are also in various types, some look Arab, some look Hispanic, some even look blonde...  I would say that Turks look more like Spaniards than Latinos...
0121db3d89fa7258a5d230763048afc9aa	Yes, today. We are in sync Nicky.     I really don't what exactly set me off today. But by 1pm I was just so messed up. My class didn't start until 3:55pm and I literally just sat in front of the door of the class for over 2 hours, alone in the hallway. Everything about school has me so stressed out. I don't know why I feel like this but I don't even want to be in college Nicky. You know how they say school just isn't for everyone?     But why?     I just stressed me out. I constantly have this tension in my body. It's emotional. It's even physical sometimes. I feel myself shaking. My chest hurts. My throat. There's just all this pressure in every direction. Having pressure to do good in school, make something of myself, get through college and get some job.     I see other around me that are so good with themselves. They know what they want. I don't even know. I'm here in school because I have to be. Sure, I like certain things, but inside, I just don't care enough. I know this. But still, the fact that I "have" to do this because that's just how life is. You have no choice.     On top of that, I'm just a lonely person. Always have been. Though I've gotten used to that to some extent. But it does hurt sometimes.     Today sitting in the hallway, I wanted to cry. I wanted so bad to just leave all my things there, walk out of that building and forget about school. Forget about everything. I just want to "be". Exist very quitely. No more than that.     Later in the day, I was walking to the bus stop...sort of dizzy/crying. I just pictured myself running in front of the bus. I kind of tilted my body as it came. I finally got on the bus and, just cried some more.     Nicky, I don't want anything really. I don't ask anything from anyone. But most of the time, I just want to not exist. Or, exist, but not like this. Not like me. I feel like I'm complaining over petty things. But I've felt like this for so long already. Not just recently. Almost my whole life. Just thinking over who I am, how this world is set up and how you are forced to do things because if you don't, you will be seen as unsuccessful.     I love you Nicky.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PoJv4N1T...|`|TZgVwGzeaa	Awwww...sorry sweetie.  Sounds like a rough day :)   Take a nice bath and try to go to bed early tonight.  I think you need a good nights sleep.  It will really help, believe me.  And why aren't you eating at school?  Feel better....OK?|`|nooocNV1aa	I have terrible days.  I used to feel like this, but after a while I slowly grew numb, and now I hate everything except music.  It all piled up so much that I ran out of tears and emotion.  I'm pretty much an empty husk.|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	*BIG HUGS* to you.   Those kind of days are no stranger to me. Drop everything you've been loaded up on, make your self a nice cup of hot cocoa and curl up under the blankies by 9 o'clock latest. Have a good cry in bed, listen to some music and get ready for a new day feeling refreshed and energized. Oh, and prepare yourself a nice big lunch for school tomorrow! I don't focus well without food in me. School  can't be the end of you...let your work slide for one night and take a breather. Just recently I had essay and project piled up one after the other... I would stay up to three in the morning writing this stupid essay and wake up at six. I would end up going to school miserable and someone would say something that would set me off and I would bawl for the rest of the day and everyone would be like wow what's her problem. Take it easy for a bit... Your well being is more important than school.     And good luck with your girlfriend as well!|`|e7gkttgcaa	i feel ur pain  ..honestly, ive been crying everyday for the past one and half week  I'm sick, im coughing up blooding, I feel miserable and im outta ebergy  Ive been beaten and kick out of the house ive known for 16 years because im bi..  ...my dads an alcoholic and my moms a passover  theres nothing to do but cry...    ...ive got to pick mmyself up one of these day..and my exams are coming up and im too lost to freak out|`|UWt3Q9sAaa	I know how you feel Sugar.

HH90Eghaaa	Oh Yes!  One example was seeing my new baby niece for the first time!|`|BFKm5Pc7aa	Yes. Like the time I had never had any sort of a relationship with any boy, let alone even kissed him, and I was at this guy's house and he took my face and made out with me....I was in shock, and i think i stopped breathing for a second....it was great!|`|nooocNV1aa	i do i just havent had one - I try to avoid feeling emotions.|`|vV5QIlMVaa	YES! many many times. hahaha. and i like it (: it also feels like my heart skips a beat ^^|`|PLZrvfFEaa	Well there was this boy that was awesome...but he moved and so I forgot him....Dammit.|`|IiscnSGGaa	i don't know if i can believe in them because i never had one of those moments :(
NekOuxFEaa	Are you sure you like him? Is he the first boy you've liked? (Email:xxI_gave_you_blood@yahoo.com)    There are 4 Scenarios here;  1. (Considering he knows your gay)   You tell him and HE is NOT a homophob, and he's cool with it, you get it off your chest, he moves on and you move on knowing you aren't hiding anything.   2. (Considering he knows your gay)  You tell him and HE is NOT cool with it, then first off he wasn't a friend, and second off you could..always recover saying I'm just playing, because if he already knows your gay then it could be a total joke.  3. (If he DOESNT know your gay)  You tell him and you also admit your true orientation and he's completely chill and you guys move on, much like scenario 1.  4. (If he DOESNT know your gay)  You tell him and admit your orientation and he freaks out, about both, then again he's not a true friend and there really is no way to recover but gain you got it off your chest.    Think about your friend and which scenario you can see happening  if its most likely 1&3 I'd go for it.|`|VmXchYyCaa	Don't hurt yourself like I did. Are you friends with him? Jokingly talk about gays and if he is one. Does he know you are? I would come out to him.|`|tDmemV5yaa	Leave him alone.  Are you a jerK.?  then don't act like one.|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Buy birth control? Go to KFC, I don't get the question?|`|uZQIUeyvaa	move on. If he is straight then leave it alone. You can tell him but only if you are prepared for a wierd couple of seconds.|`|vV5QIlMVaa	are you sure he is not gay? If he really is then i guess you can find some other people ! i mean theres a lot of people out there, i am sure someone will fit for you perfectly (:|`|cIPziIdnaa	Quit wasting your time and find someone else - someone who can return your affections.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Keep him as a friend only. You don't want to lose that, as true friends are there for you through thick and thin, whereas most relationships come and go.|`|uKBJniEKaa	You can't do anything about it.
W9C7m130aa	Well besides dreaming about them and having my pets bark at the door moving by itself, and feeling my bed shake by itself. I had this really scary experience when I was 15 years old.     One early morning at 3 oclock. I woke up at the edge of my bad trying hard to go back to sleep. Because the edge of my bad was facing the door I could see straight through into the halloway. Just so happen, the bathroom light was on and the light keep me focused into the shadow of the halloway.  All of a sudden I see a dark tall figure staring at me with wild crazy hair. So I raise my head out of my blanket to see if what I was seeing was real. When I raised my head the dark figure jumped back and hid behind the door frame wall. And I jumped back a little as well. I was now peeking through my blankets scared as hell. As soon as I did, the figure leaned its body slowly into my door way peeking at me again. And then I peeked out a little too. And it jumped back again! At this time I that what I was seeing was real! This ghost seemed to be playing with me. The ghost peeked over one last time and I jumped up out my bed and ran through the halloway screaming at the top of my lungs!!     I admediately ran into my brothers room thinking that it was him playing tricks on me. Him and his girlfriend would not wake up. I banged on my moms door for at least 15 minutes and she would not wake. So I had to go back to sleep in fear, thinking that the black figure would soon visit me again. I never saw it again. Now I just dream about them. And have weird preminitions, some that have come true.|`|Inc78M0Raa	Well, the ones I have are kinda more religion-based.  -In our town, a little boy died and after they buried him his mom would come to his grave everyday and ask God to give her a sign that he is ok, and in heaven. And one day a figure of an Angel appeared on his head stone. It hadn't been there before. It's still there too. I have a picture of it.  -My grandma has a picture that my Great Granddad or someone took during a thunder storm, and there is a figure/face in the sky of someone. Everyone says it's God.|`|8k6kxOh2aa	well, i used to be chased up the stairs by a shadow person or demon...something of that sort. it moved faster than me and i had a feeling that if it ever caught me, it would be really bad. on the nights that it would chase me, i would practically vault up the stairs. it stopped doing it for a while, but recently i sensed that it is planning to start chasing me again soon. i can't' explain why, i just do.|`|AQlA6nu0aa	I came home one day with my sister by my side. My dad dropped us in front of the house and we waved goodbye cause he had to go to work. Then when we went in the house a shadow like figure was sitting at our table not too far from where we were and we werent close to the door so we just ran in the room and locked it. We grabbed pencils and sharp objects to protect ourselves. Then me and my sis waited for 3 hours until my mom got home from work. I didnt go out to get food and a phone wasnt in our room. It was pretty scary.|`|Pa450SHiaa	One night i saw a cloud of dust when i was little in my room and thought it was a ghost|`|NaIRHlDbaa	When I was about 4 I shared a bedroom with my brother and sister in an apartment in New York.    One night an eerie light lit up our bedroom and a man was standing in the doorway leaning casually against the frame.  He was dressed in a tux with a hi-hat and he smiled at us and performed card tricks and made flowers come out of his hat.  The flowers fell to the floor but then disappeared.    He never spoke--he just performed these tricks in the light and it was really quiet.    We told our parents but they NEVER believed us.  Later when we were older we were told that a magician had lived in the same apartment we were in and had died there.|`|A4GIgwxVaa	no but ive heard voices in school when i was alone in a room|`|ijqD3oxxaa	Yes, i actually have a ghost video that I personally recorded. The video was taken in a cementary in San Luis Potosi. I still have the video saved on this computer. The video shows a figure (looks like a woman) thats transparent and the just stands there looking at camera.|`|j7EwfvUsaa	when i first moved into my new apartment i stared having strange feelings like i was being watched. one night i was laying in bed and all the hair on my body stood on end, some thong in me told me that some one or thing was standing behind me, i knew if i turned around and saw something i would never sleep in that house again so i closed my eyes and prayed for sleep. i used to have a touch lamp in my bedroom, one night it started turning on and off by it's self, i chalked it up to wiring problems so i unplugged it, then i heard a large crash from my daughters room when i went to check her dresser had been up ended, she is two, there is no way she could have moved the heavy wood thing. i took her back to my room and plugged the light back in for a few min it was fine as soon as i had my daughter calmed back down the light started turning on and off again. than in a very distanced voice my little girl pointed to the light and said...look at the little boy mommy! i have done some research and found that a young boy died in my apartment complex in the late 70's and that i am not the only person to have experienced the haunting from this child.   The scariest experience I have had was when I was sixteen a friend and I were working on my aunts apple orchard,  we were cleaning out her old barn to store new product in when we found a spirit board.   We were almost done so we decide to take a brake and play around. Mind you it was the middle of the day and we were alone because every one else was on picking duty on the other side of the 20 archer orchard.   We set it up on an old blanket and at first we were playing around  spelling each others names and such, witch is why I thought my friend was the one who spelled out the word apple on the board.  But when an apple came flying at me from behind and hit me on the back of my head we went running across the orchard screaming for help!  We never did finish cleaning the barn!  I see them all the time but have never tried to talk with one thought my fried believes that this might be possible for me, however I accidentally walked through one once and I felt the sudden feeling of complete depression and desperation.   My wiccan friend said I was feeling what he felt at the time of his death.|`|AA12384132	Being a supernatural and paranormal researcher I can honestly say I have seen and felt spirits numerous time under a multitude of different situations.............|`|6X1hJeZYaa	Well, When I was little I would go to bed my mom would tuck me in etc.  Well When I was 4 my Great Grandfather died. He never got to meet me :( and I never got to meet him :*( Anyway a week later after he died I would see a blackish purplish dark blueish figure. I have seen pictures of him and he has glasses and such and when I saw that figure I saw the outline if the glasses. It was like 6 feet away from my bed staring at me reaching his hands out toured me.(o.k I'm kinda getting water eyes aha)  Anyway I ran down stairs and told me mom. My mom said just sleep down here for the night. Well I did.  Next night I dreamed of him. He was telling me that he was sorry he never got to meet me. I woke up scared and saw that figure again. I started crying and ran back down stairs. Told my mom she said that I have been doing this for a week now. Anyway....The next day my Grandma sent me this stuffed Snoopy dog that My great Grandfather wanted me to have after he died. Well I got it I sat it on my shelf. (Night came) My mom told me not to think about him when I go to bed cause I get to scared and see things. Well My mom went down stairs and I just sat on my bed scared to go to sleep. I looked at my Snoopy dog and it was just sitting on the shelf. I layed down and Fell asleep. Woke up at 3:00AM. Saw the figure *Again*! It just stand there where it always wer. I just pulled the covers over my head and fell asleep. Woke up in the morning and the Snoopy dog was on the floor on the other side then the shelf was and it was staring at me.   And after that was the last of all that stuff happening.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	can not say i have. I mean unless you can see your deceit animals. then yes...|`|Nh5CgRTaaa	Yes, I've seen and felt their presence many times. My feet are particularly sensitive to feeling their energies. I also saw three boys, two seemed happy. they were skipping and singing lou lou skip to my lou. the third seemed angry, but I think he directed his anger toward a girl who is no longer my friend. She couldn't see them though me and my best friend could. Short after, she turned on me and now we are no longer friends. At the time I didn't trust the three ghost boys and was scared. now I think he was just trying to help me. I have gone back looking for them to thank him and see if he needed help, but I haven't seen him yet again. My best friend and I will go back next earthday, as that was the day we saw them last year, and try to find them. There is also some four-legged black shadowy ghost in my house. I am the only one who can see it and feel it so far, and I don't know what it is. Also last night, it felt like someone who is no longer alive or something who cares about me was placing their hand on my face, on my right cheek. I don't know who or what it was, but I know it was something and it felt like a cold hand. I think who or whatever it was was trying to compfort me because I had a really bad headache and was laying in bed in a lot of pain trying to sleep. I tend to be VERY sensitive to any change of energy or heat around me, especially my feet, I am also very perceptive to my surroundings.
N9VN9bwfaa	Rapunzel is locked up in a tower with nothing but a lot of hair to keep her company and she's off in the boonies with nobody but a wicked witch to talk to.  What does she know about anything?  Along comes a well-educated handsome prince on a HORSE who has the clever idea of climbing up her hair (which must have smarted something fierce, I reckon) to check out the tower room.  Then he figures out how to do in the wicked witch and the two young folks come down out of that tower again.  Then they both hop onto the HORSE.  Now they have transportation from the back of beyond to wherever it was that Mr. Handsome came from.  Once she was there, Miss Smartypants Rapunzel could get that divorce you'd like her to get and chop those golden locks and leave off sitting in towers.  Because she'd have all the horses she'd need to go wherever she wanted from that point forward.  That's what's up with that.|`|2iqSofzYaa	because...  once upon a time there was a poor couple. they lived in a small cottage near the land of a very wealthy woman. The poor man and his wife were expecting their first child, but they had no food. out of desperation the man ventured onto the land of the wealthy womanand found a cabage patch near his home. he took a few heads of cabage to feed his wife and unborn child. as he turned to leave, the wealthy woman aproched him with her guards. She asked him why he had stolen from her. he explained his situation and the wealthy woman said " i am unable to have childern of my own, if you give me your first born child, i will raise it as my own, and you will be allowed to take as much cabage from my garden as you want for as long as you and your wife live. the man agreed. the wealthy woman would be able to care for and feed the child, and he and his wife would never go hungry, nor would their other childern that would follow.  when the wife gave birth to a health baby girl, the wealthy woman arived to take the child. the man and his wife were sad, but they knew it was a good choice.  the wealthy woman took the child to a tower in the forest. she wanted to raise the child away from the evils of humanity. the child was taught art and music, but the woman told her that other people were wicked, and would hurt her.  the woman was a witch. she used magic to enter the tower. only she came to visit the child. and only she knew the wy in or out.  one day, when the girl was of age, she sat on the balcony of her tower playing the harp.  a hunter, who was the son of a lord, herd the harp, and followed the music to the girl. he watched and listened to her play. her was enchanted by her beauty. he returned many times to watch her before he was brave enough to speak to her. he called out after one of her songs  "do not stop playing, your playing is lovely"  the girl gasped then screamed  "what is wrong?" the hunter asked, very confused  "you have come to hurt me" she replied  " i only came to hear you play and gaze upon your beauty"  " my mother said that all people are bad"  "is your mother bad?" he asked  "no...she is kind and loving"  "then not all people are bad"  the girl thaught this over for a few moments  the hunter decided to break the silence " dont be afraid of me, you are safe in your tower, i can not hurt you. and i would never want to do so"  she knew she was safe, so she decided that no harm could come from talking to the hunter.  he returned everyday for months to hear her play and talk with her. they fell in love, and when they could not stand to be so far apart any longer, the girl (who had never cut her hair) used it as a rope to allow the hunter to climb up to her.  for a few weeks after he began to visit her in the tower, they went unseen by the witch. but one day he stayed too long and the witch saw him leave.  believing her daughter had been tricked, the witch rushed up to the tower, the girl told her mother about how in love they were. the witch couldnt believe the hunter loved her daughter. she took the girl away from the tower, and cut off her long hair. the witch returned to the tower to set a trap for the hunter. then she waited.  the next day the hunter returned. he called up to his love in the tower. the witch droped the rope of hair from the balcony while staying hiden. as the hunter neared the balcony, the witch showed herself and yelled at the hunter for tricking her daughter, startled he fell. and the rose bushes at the bottom rose up to chatch him, he called to the witch " i did not trick her, i love her and want to wed her."  the witch comanded to thorns to scratch his eyes.  "i do love her he cried as the thorns blinded him"  " if you love her then you will find her! her tears are the only cure for your blindness!"  the wich left him strugeling in the bushes.  "i will find her!" he pulled himself out of the bushes and began his search. he found his horse and the horse took him home, his father gave him a traveling cloak and a bag of money for his journey.  for 10 years he wndered calling his loves name, untill oneday when he was in a land where he did not understand the language people spoke and the ground had turned to sand, he called her name and he heard her voice call his, within moments, her arms were around him, and she kissed him on his forhead, her tears fell and driped into his scratched eyes. the wounds healed and he could see her.  "i knew you would find us!" she cried.  "us?"  she introduced him to his son who was nearly nine years old.  they journeyed together back to his fathers home, where they were married, and they raised their son together.    thats the story as it was told to me by the fireside by a very good story teller.    did she need to be saved?  was the witch really bad?  both the hunter and the wealthy woman loved her.  the witch wnted to save her from the evils of the world. the hunter wanted to love her and care for her....|`|60668e20144a7d7b9a1bd023ec2a40fcaa	because women weren't that proactive at that point in time.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	lol i think you are right but the point of the story was the romance, while doing the job herself was completely possible, she wanted a man to save her. maybe to prove that chivalry is not dead?|`|8k6kxOh2aa	well, climbing down her own hair would have been difficult since she would have had to descend it like a rope. she didn't have scissors or a sword either. she couldn't have cut her hair.

bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	Bisexuality focuses on the gender binary.  That means there are two genders--male and female.    In reality, there are other genders.  Trans, intersex, genderqueer, etc.  Some of them don't identify as "male" or "female."  If you are still attracted to them, you are possibly pansexual.    Asexual means that person has no sexual attraction.  They can still be attracted to people as romantic partners, and they can still look for love, but they aren't interested in sex with another person.    I have blonde hair, and I wish it was a bit lighter.|`|I0xO8IAHaa	Asexual- not really into sex    Pansexual- you dont care the gender|`|TpkRuXyMaa	It seems as if you got the answers you needed, so I wont bother typing all of it down for ya, lol     Mini Poll:  My hair is dirty blonde... gotten darker as I have gotten older.

There are because people have to reassure themselves. Oh and asexual means that the person is not sexually attracted to anyone. They were born that way...I think. Well idk who would be able to choose that. :)  Mine is like dark brown. I like it how it is... is that okay? lol.  Hugs. Your welcome.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	Asexual means you are not sexually attracted to anybody.

Pansexual means that you are sexually attracted to all humans, regardless of the gender that they are or identify with.    Bisexual means that you are attracted to men and women.    The difference between Bisexuality and Pansexuality is that Pansexuals are not only attracted to both sexes, but attracted to persons that fall outside of the traditional gender binary [i.e. androgynous, transexual, etc]    You would be considered Pansexual, as you are attracted to transgendered as well as traditional men and women    Mini Poll: I have Dark Auburn hair. Its my natural color, and I love it.|`|TLOgBy3caa	Nah. You are who you are. But, if I were to be all smart sounding, yes ma'am, you are bi.  Heterosexual- straight, attraction towards the other sex.

I don't think I can change it to another color without damaging my hair. besides, I love my hair! Don't you? :]|`|osGwqKylaa	Hey there :]  I'm kinda stalking your questions...but I don't really answer much...  So yeah...  Pansexual people are those that do not care for gender, and fall in love with someone because of their looks, personality... not caring for their sexuality. The real difference between bisexuals and pansexuals is that while bi people are attracted to both the female and male bodies, pansexuals are attracted to the person itself.    Asexual people are those who are not sexually attracted by anyone, male or female.     My hair is somewhere between brown blonde and black XD. Due to different hair colourings I did time ago.   I want weird coloured hair. Like green or something.

hZjPYyFTaa	Sorry pup. You are just a victim of bad theology. You are one of many who somehow have come to the conclusion that religion means a joyless existence of mere rule-following.  What am I saying that's fundamentalism an aberrant form of belief.     If you want to start a religion, you have to   Make your arguments for the Existence of your God  If There is a God, then What is He Like?  What Does that Mean for Us?    Then learn from the greats: Rene Descartes and his use of the ontological argument to avoid global scepticism;  Immanuel Kant offered a moral argument for theism. The list is so very long.     So you've done your studying. The next question you have to have a darned good argument for is Suffering:  Why Won't God Heal Amputees?  Why Won't God Heal Cancer Victims?  Why Won't God Solve the Problems in Israel?  Why Won't God Prevent Deadly Hurricanes and Tsunamis?  Why Won't God Prevent Metallica from Making Another CD?    That is where you will run into trouble. Christians have been at this a long time and just about every other belief system. So you go to the writers listed below and come up with something far more clever.    St. Augustine on the Problem of Evil  St. Thomas Aquinas on the Problem of Evil  Peter Kreeft on the Problem of Evil  William Lane Craig on the Problem of Evil  Daniel Howard-Snyder The Evidential Argument from Evil  Evil and the Justice of God book by N.T. Wright  Making Sense Out of Suffering book by Peter Kreeft  God, Freedom, and Evil book by Alvin Plantinga  The Problem of Pain book by C.S. Lewis    Then write your hymns, organize your Bishops, start spreading your own unique gospel and get money.|`|q3Lae9p1aa	Seeing yourself in the mirror, should never be classified as a vision.

XnQWpUZMaa	The location of Hells vary (according to tripitaka) -- some (said to be the hot/fire hells) are located below the surface, some are not.    But I don't quite get your doubt/question -- are you doubting the physical size of hell that it is too small to accommodate so many sentient beings? If it is, then do not use humans' physical measurement of size/time etc to measure the same in other realms. Size/time etc are relative to your consciousness and other conditions. What we physically see as a small space can indeed be a large space to the beings in another realm/hell (affected by their consciousness).|`|Wr09qsYMaa	From my understanding, Buddhist do not believe in hell, nor heaven. They believe in Nirvana (not Kurt). Nirvana cannot be defined except as ultimate freedom from suffering, eternal happiness. I am sure Buddhit do not believe in Hell but I can be wrong, but I'm sure I am not.|`|LGvwl67waa	That's a wrong translation.    It should say "below the Realm of Men"... as shown in the Wheel of Becoming (Bhavacakra)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhavacakra    Also, it isn't "Hell" so to speak, but the Realm of Demons (creatures filled with hate) / Realm of Woeful State    ... Also, keep in mind that the Buddha was very clear that we must not see these realms as anything more than imagery.    **The Flat-Earth ideology was only found in Judeo-Christian theology... there is no such concept in Asia.    *****************  Edit:  >>Gwen- I was taught this by a monk who speaks Pali.    I didn't mean necessarily a wrong translation from Brahmi to English... Pali might be language of the earliest Buddhist texts, but, as you probably know, there have been many disputes as to what the texts meant. That is why Buddhism has divided into so many branches.    But, you have to keep in mind that many of these traditions are tainted by local cultures, which the Buddha warned us against.    Many of the Buddhist traditions found in India are influenced by the strong mysticism of the many Gods & Goddesses, Heroes and Legends. They become illustrated to a point that can sometimes overwhelm the philosophical message behind them.    ... This is why I thought it best to remind you that the Buddha warns us against imagery.    Whichever tradition of Buddhism you study, you will find that the practice of the Middle Way is far more important than whatever imagery it is associated with.    Personally, I find the Wheel of Becoming a lot less obstructive as an image than other images found in other traditions.|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	Because the writers did not understand Buddhism.|`|vquwiGegaa	In my dream, Kristigarbha Bodhisattva point the way to Hells, and its seems to me in my dream yoga state, I opened a small door of a cabinet in a temple like structure, and as soon as I opened the door, a stair case leading into the ground. I spent two night of seven hours in my sleep touring the place.     There was nothing to be seen or felt. May be the images was so shocking, they were blocked from my memory; or there really was nothing there, because I have no sins to cause me to see the Hells? (this is said in the Sutra, for those who have no affinities with Hells will see nothing.)    In truth, are Hells in the ground below the surface of Earth? No, I don't think so; why do people think everything must take place on Earth? This is to show how shallow mind lead to shallow understanding!!!    I can give one or more Sutras and they will tell you, many things actually take place else where other than Earth. To get any where in the Universe, a pure mind set is all it need to get there. For those who have affinity, it is already next to them or even in their heart/mind.|`|HtcgJSaIaa	cause they are highly misguided.|`|SvEzmp4Laa	It is either delusion or symbolism.

ff8c8f70711433a84c69c09e9d42a28baa	i think it really depends on the relationship and what you guys do in bed. if it is all about fun and real casual saying "you know you'd look super hot in one of my shirts like you're in the office" or something. if shes into it she'll go for it if not no big deal she'll probably just think you're weird then get right back to it. (don't push it if she doesn't like the idea especially) if she's your girlfriend and you are in a solid commited relationship, i'd wait at least a few months til you are comfortable enuf suggesting something liek that. when you said fetish i figured something repulisvely odd like smearing poop but buttondowns and a wet office look? sounds hot! i think alot of girls would be willing!!!|`|0hdo4WORaa	My fetish is for thigh high boots on my lady.

It's not an every time thing, just sometimes I get in the mood to wear spikes, leather and get tied up.  It actually wasn't that difficult to tell my husband.  My husband asked me straight out what my fetishes were and I just told him.  We already know it's wrong to make fun of someone's fetish.  How are you supposed to trust your spouse with intimate secrets if you think they'll just laugh at you?|`|u6K5TtRlaa	You want your partner to wear a satin blouse? Well, if she doesn't have one already, then go and get her one, start having some sexy activity, and when she makes to take it off, just tell her you'd rather her have it on. It's just as easy as saying they found a spot on your body that you enjoy.    I'd recommend you start just with the blouse, tell her to keep it on, and when you're done you should just admit that you have a little fetish for her wearing the blouse. Don't talk about like shirts on other women, just say, "I like it when YOU wear a blouse," and say that it'd be fun for you if she wore it the next time, too.    After you've broken the ice with that first one, ask her if there's anything fun that you can do for her. Make sure this is a two way street. If she has something, run with it and have fun. If not, just ask her sometime if she might be willing to try something with office clothing. If you've been positive about you guys's use of funky preferences during sex, I don't know why she'd decline. Just make sure to provide a lot of reinforcement, make sure she knows that you enjoy the situation as it evolves, and always be open to her fetishes, too.    And you asked for our fetishes? Well, I have a thing about biting my guys, and I like to hold their hands back sometime. I only restrain them on rare occasions, usually only when I've found someone who really enjoys it, but I like to keep a dominant role, definitely.    Happy Humping!

LBNVmvaWaa	I don't care what people think of me. I'm me and no one on the face of earth could ever change that. I think that you have to be a strong person to do that too because people are gonna say mean things no matter what. You have to learn how to tune them out and be who you want, not what others want to see. I think if you stop caring about what people think you become a more uniquer person. You obviously don't want to be the like everyone else. Your you, he's himself, and I'm me. No one can ever change who we are. We've got one life to live why satrt caring what people think? I've also struggled with this. In the past, I always wondered why had to be me, I was very insecure but once you've become a strong person who can deal with it, it really doesn't matter. I promise it'll get easier to tune out the people who say mean things to you if you start not really caring and following your own style. Who knows. they might even follows your own style. Good luck!|`|vRPqfdlaaa	To answer this question as if it came from you will mean I direct the answer to you. Maybe it will benefit you also. If you stand alone in the middle of the room and look around you you will find that you are not attached to any other object or human being. So then you come to understand that only you exist for yourself. And you have one body. No other human being has a right to your body, what you do with it. And you understand that with-in that body beats one heart. Not two. Not three. One. It's yours. You fill it. You fill it with any emotion you want. No one else has a right to tell you how to feel. This is America. You are free to feel the way you want to.      And with-in that body is your mind. You fill your mind with whatever information you want to. No one has the right to tell you no, learn this, not that. And with-in that body is your spirit. The spirit is you. You project what kind of human you are. How you act. And with-in the hidden recesses of your spiritual mind is your soul. Your soul is the repository of all you have thought, all you have felt emotionally, what you have done physically. Both good and bad, right and wrong, wisely or ignorantly. So you come to understand that you are free to think what you want , feel what you want, do what you want as long as what you think, say ,feel, or do does not harm another human being. And if you are secure in the foundation of your thoughts and feelings you will never allow another human being to control you unless you voluntarily agree to do so. And that is what happens with your brother. By being self conscious about what others think of him he is not concentrating on what he thinks of himself. He is allowing others to dictate his own actions and feelings. He voluntarily allows other people to have control over his self. He needs a course in self-confidence and the best one I know is karate. For it will teach him self discipline and confidence in himself as he matures through the Kata. And then he won't give a damn about what anyone thinks of him for he will come to know himself.      That's all I have.|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Ive thought about this a lot because ive struggled with it. The conclusion ive come to is, at the end of the day all you've got is yourself. You go to sleep with yourself in your own head. You are ALL you have. If you go around serving others you are never going to please yourself. Of coarse never go around doing things at the expense of others, hurting. But life your life as you want because there is no time to live to anyone elses agenda. Take what people may think or say with a grain of salt. You have your opinions of other people, but they don't drop everything for you do they?|`|HsT9sW5Xaa	Caring about what people think is natural for humans. You can't stop it, unless he wants to be in total isolation for the rest of his life. What he CAN do is begin caring about his own opinion of himself more than the opinion of others.

His opinion of himself is much more important than the opinion of others.|`|9ceRmqUAaa	Ask him what about your happiness you don't do what makes other stupid people happy because that's not gonna make you happy if you like and it makes you happy do you you will be very unhappy caring  what people think.

The best way to stop caring about what people think is to start caring about what God thinks. Compare yourself to a higher power and it no longer matters what "mere mortals" think of you if God approves.  Really, what does it matter what other people think? Your brother can't please everyone. No matter what he does, someone will disapprove. It's not so bad to care what friends/family think, but complete strangers? Ask him why he cares what strangers think. Ask him how their disapproval will hurt him. Conformity will certainly hurt him; conformity is like a cage.|`|Pa4cyKn7aa	Everyone cares what others think of them whether subconsciously or unconsciously.    I don't think it can be helped.|`|7u9jOxu8aa	Just stop caring.  The only people who really matter are you and the people who love you.  At the end of the day who cares what some person on the street, who you are probably never going to see again thinks about you in that one instant.  I think it's about confidence and knowing who you are, if he was cool enough to go out and get a mohawk, he should own it.  Depending on his age and personality it might just be something that he has to learn over time and come to terms with.
ECx267Jzaa	Some say that Aryans invaded , others , re-migrated . Whatever be the truth , they have merged with Hindus now . Unlike Abrahamists , they have inculcated the truths behind Hindu Gods' idols . Many have enriched the Dravidian's Gods culture . It is true that there is no mentioning about Hindu Gods in Rig Vedas (ie) before their invasion/migration . Only after finding the Dravidian's Gods , they found/formed the other three Vedas upon Hindu Gods . Details are there in Brahmendra's Brahma Sutra Darisana Vilakkam . Now it is good to mention all as Hindus . The only trouble is most of them are openly or secretly encouraging the rubbish caste culture !.....except a few like Ramakrishna Paramahansa , Ramana Maharishi , Brahmendra .|`|5wAAnZPYaa	You forget about Aryan and Dravidians. I TAKE it as american and african policy but you need not accept it.    O.K. We are Both tamilians Let us sort our owndifferences between ourselves and by ourselves alone rpt ourselves alone.    First of all what is the reason for the Tamilians and singhalians enmity?    My dear friend what I give are purely my opinions whether you accept it or not  I don't care and I will not force you to accept and also I will not  swear that the rabbit I  got has got only three legs.    What I believe is this.    During the English rule,They settlet at good climate places They kept the administration and treat the local as slaves.They want the locals to help them.Only for this they educated the locals.Education means that school education and administrative education.Those who are camphore minded, they caught it easily and banana leaf mind could not do it so easily. So in all areas the Tamilians floursihed and the singhalians started murmuring.    At that point The english man transplanted  lot of tamil garden workers  to ceylone.The singhalians feared that they will become minority. To avoid that the then Govt denied the voting right to the Tamil estate worker  as they are aligners or not permanent dwellers or so many other true or false reasons    I THINK THAT FROM THERE ONLY the conflict started.    I don't want to go into who is right or who is wrong or which is right or which is wrong.    But any how the war has started, But Tell me whether All the tamilians who fought for the welfare of the Tamilians are really UNITED? Don't they kill and destroy enormous forces among themselves.?what is your reply.  My dear gentleman You (we) shout that innocent tamilians are being killed by the arrogant attitude of srilankan Govt.BUT will you (we ) shout in the same tone if they are not innocent Tamilians and perhaps innocent Kannadians are malayalees? Be frank.    My dear gentleman I am not  a Brahmin AND  not a supporter of Brahmins, But ONLY A TAMILIAN  I dont have faith in intelligent or dull headed fellows. I am of the opinion that Every body has a talent.But my questions are all the tamilians are united. Repeat all tamilians and exclusively excluding all the brahmins, are we united?We fight amongourselves by the names of castes and fight amongourselves to keep or hold or catch the administrations    I am sorry we ourselves have lot of mistakes(perhaps in my opinion)and how can we blame others> I don't say what singhalians do are right,But let us be first united among ourselves and then sort out the differences with others.

QgE85Qynaa	Keep in mind that compared to other sections of Syrian society, the Syrian Jews are only moderately wealthy.    The answer is, quite simply, that in Syria, the older the family/tribe/community, the more likely it is that they'll be wealthy. In Aleppo, for example, if a family is old, than its more or less certain that they'll be rich. After being embedded in an area for centuries, wealthy accumulates. What you see in the Syrian Jewish community is centuries of slowly accumulated wealth.    As far as them not knowing (as you have put it) "anything about the outside world", this is simply a Syrian trait. Syria is one of the most stable countries in the Middle East largely due to its isolationist policies (much like the pre-WWI US). While many Syrians are very well aware of the outside world, they often will not discuss it simply because it does not affect them.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Well, I've heard the Syrian jews of Brooklyn, which is a "closed community" in that they don't do conversions, don't allow intermarriage with converts, and probably don't look fondly on intermarriage between those in their community and other jewish communities, worked closely with the Waltons of Wal-Mart.    I've heard they're also a very socialistic type community in that they always watch the back of other members of the community in terms of financial and moral support.    From a religious point of view, I have HEARD that many of them really aren't all that observant religiously, and many jews believe their stance on converts and decendants of converts is "sinful"    The punishment for marrying a convert or someone from outside of the community is to be cut off from the community and shunned. I've heard the children of such marriages are permenently shunned....this is only what I've heard.|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	They have connection with Israel or something.    watch this, they own the world.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saeky9I5T...|`|pC1rRb9Oaa	wanna hear a joke!!

But they probably are just blessed.|`|suu9JuhBaa	I personally am not Jewish but have had Jews stand up for me when I really needed someone and I have a German name although I am Irish and Scottish as well - and being Canadian from birth I am really not at all German and nor do I want to be. Suprising it is and I will never forget this because they were truer than many other people and I knew a lot of different people at these times.   I also worked for a Jewish company at one time and the owner told me some things that Jews do to become the business people that they are. My experience of the Jews I knew is that they have depth and breadth and they can think for themselves which not everyone can.
9l3Oil9zaa	their chances are not as high as anyone who has sex with a penis involved. lol.  the bodily fluids have to come from her and get inside you some kind of way or there be blood to blood contact.  that is why you really don't hear of lesbians getting infected with hiv as much---think about it.|`|I0xO8IAHaa	it could happen|`|K36jovxfaa	body   fluids|`|P544Sbmqaa	HIV is transmitted by blood on blood contact.  If the two lesbians have blood on blood contact, then yes, they can spread it to each other.  Bodily fluids is considered a blood produt for this purpose and penetration of anything can cause small tears inside the vagina.  So if they are having digital penetration and there is an open wound on the finger and it creates a tear in the vagina, it can spread.  If they share toys, it can spread.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	You can get it by theses    Semen  Blood  Vaginal Fluids  Saliva|`|Mok3ewI2aa	Body Fluids.    I'm level 3.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	yes hiv can be transmitted via blood or body fluids|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	It's the exchange of body fluids that carry the HIV.  So if lesbians are exchange body fluids in some manner, there you go.  I think I read someplace that lesbians have a lower rate of HIV infection though but maybe they're just more careful, or honest with each other.    Congrats!  3 months is kind of fast unless you're basically living on Y!A.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It would be *really* difficult for lesbians to transmit the HIV virus.  I believe they have about the lowest transmission rate around.    I mean, it would have to be blood into an open wound, which is kind of usual.    You would have to drink about a gallon of saliva to catch HIV, so that won't do it.    Gay males, heterosexual couples, and drug users are all much more at risk than the lesbian community, though we all have to watch out for all the rest of the nasty illnesses out there.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	If one of the partners is infected, then yes, because there still is a transfer of body fluids.|`|c1wCuGzpaa	one word..gross!|`|PLZrvfFEaa	I answer questions that are fully specific.|`|dx9AZ16Paa	wht the hell?  lesbians cant have sex  so no they cant get hiv!|`|Ekra9yrhaa	yes they can, as bodily fluids can still be exchanged, espeacially, when one woman is pms and the other is doing oral, that one of the main ways to get it.     Also there is other viruses out there just as dangerous, like chlomidiea, herpititus A, B AND .    So please be careful|`|vV5QIlMVaa	Yes, bodily fluid.     congrats on level 2 ^^ i excatly know how you feel ! hahah!! these points are hecka hard to earn !! Keep it up btw ! hahah im level 3 and its killing me to go to level 4 !! ughhh >|`|CotWcTI0aa	It doesn't matter what way you "do it." Even oral. As long as you're "sharing" fluids, you can get HIV.    I just can't seem to get to level 3!! Good luck though!|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	They definitely can!  HIV is found in bodily fluids and blood is a prime example. Women who are menstruating are at an increased risk of transmitting it. But any woman can get it if there are tears in the vaginal wall (or oral area if oral is being performed). Plus, STD's still can be transmitted.  So please, research safe sex practices for lesbians.|`|9RqYQb0Gaa	yes because of the sexual bodily fluids    i did a history fair project on HIV and AIDS|`|NHreTs0Qaa	Yes.|`|NekOuxFEaa	If one of them is infected, yes.|`|350cc6173ffb629f134cb3e382d77470aa	yes

Good luck with your romance! :)|`|3dKy0Zxjaa	wait till you graduate... please, you risk all kinds of trouble if you don't|`|HI0oQriqaa	wait for sure until you graduate. you are fooling with trouble otherwise. you could destroy his career and your reputation . be cool if you really care for him . you can always tell him that you like him but want to wait until you are out of school.|`|Pdqpcc9faa	Wait until graduation if it is that important because then all your other teachers will think you're weird.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	i think you should wait untill after you graduate. that way know will suspect anything. He cant get into trouble after that either. So from then on out it should be smooth sailing.  Congrats on graduating!!!|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	you def. need to wait until you graduate because u could get this teacher in trouble if u "fool around" or pursue anything with him, he could get in big trouble and lose his job. it would be best to wait until over the summer is what i think.|`|b9MbC3Uraa	No.He probably thought you were joking when you said that. Plus, you'd get him fired or end up humiliating yourself. How old is he? Just wait we only have like 3 months of school left!!!|`|c816Ebkvaa	Um, wait till you graduate!  You don't want him to end up like all of those messed up teachers we see on the news, do you?|`|2rwU2KvPaa	I'd definitely wait until you graduated. You don't want to do anything hasty, before you're finally out of school.|`|G3lcNV85aa	Deff wait till you graduate. Teacher/Student relationships in High School, even for seniors are very, very dangerous. Once you're out of High School you won't have to worry about people judging, and without having just any social issues saying you're going out with a teacher. Even though you're 18 and able to consent with anything graduating would be safer. Just know you have a mutual liking for each other.|`|LBNVmvaWaa	Well it's obviously your choice but if there is something going in between you guys go for it! Don't tell anyone except close friends but I think it won't matter really. Your a Senior and gonna leave soon so go for it!|`|zH80yyDQaa	This is horrible!  It's illegal for him to express sexual interest!  Can you not find anyone your age?|`|iYDID6QRaa	holy crap. if you intend to get to know him then you definitely need to wait until you graduate and until you are at least 18. He could get put in prison for quiet some time if you attempt anything with him. I think that you might be a little young to even consider him a target at least right now he is probably at least 10 years your senior. A big decision don't be stupid you only have 4-5 months till you graduate.|`|hnxknAUcaa	Well are you 18 yet? if you are then you can technically date him without him getting put in jail. How old is he? I would not do that because I would not want to go around the school and all the teacher think that I am weird.|`|TyQVTvw1aa	Gee unless you want to get him fired or put in jail I'd wait........Do you not see the news?|`|HIRCUaPuaa	definitely wait till you graduate! you can get in trouble for things like that|`|vvrxSFEoaa	omigosh... lol    i saw the question and i was like omg    wait till graduation girly! then u can live ur lives togetherrrr.... idkkk good luck!

If you just waltz in there and name off some things but don't even recognize why they are wrong or even be sorry for them at all, they won't be forgiven.|`|15b48876ffd5505969947c3bfe59eb00aa	it was ADAM & EVE   NOT  Adam & Steve,|`|NaZGoUlwaa	I assure you that God is intensely displeased by the actions of modern-day Christians.  Jesus called these people a "brood of vipers."  As Christians, we are supposed to share the Good News.  It truly is good news, but sadly is has been presented so often by the blade of a sword.  There are no blank checks for sin.  God will punish all sin, those of the believer and non-believer alike.  He promises life, and I hope you can find it despite the misguided actions of His followers.|`|E71jweytaa	can you prove to me this idea called love exists    yet people use it as an excuse to get married all the time|`|gCVA7Z1Maa	Authoritarianism thrives on scapegoats, which is why all sorts of religions have flourished in the US, because so many religions have been permitted to exist here, unmolested, so they've turned their efforts from genocide to the dirty game of politics and lawmaking. You won't find any sense in something which at its base is irrationality, so don't expect it, but you will find plenty of people with justifiable anger due to their emotionally handicapping indoctrination willing to fight about just about anything, just because someone told them it was wrong.|`|jOwH96wKaa	Not when you're just using your religion to justify your prejudice.

Proof doesn't apply to unconditional statements (such as 'there is a god', for example), only conditional statements. For unconditional statements, the best we can ever do is bring the probability that they are correct arbitrarily close to 1 by continuing to pile up evidence in their favor, and that isn't proof.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Yeah, I'd still like some 'proof' on your 'science books' and 'where' they 'originated', eh?

I am physically female, but I was born in the wrong body, my brain is neurologically male. Perhaps you are transgender or like me transsexual. Your gender identity is something only You know. And it is a separate issue from sexual orientation or how masculine/feminine you are (or gender expression).   Transgender means that you don't fit into societies expectations for gender. Maybe you feel that you are both male and female, genderqueer, or third gender. Or maybe You are Transsexual, which is an actual birth defect. I suggest seeing a gender therapist to sort it out. As there could be a lot of reasons you feel this way. Or you could try living as a guy and researching what it means to be female to male transsexual and see if it is you, you will know right away.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Look down your pants , still feel that way ?|`|F5gtYbDVaa	.......why would you want to be gay.  thats not right..|`|oztoPKrGaa	Nothing is wrong with you  You are probably just well gay?  But if you feel like a guy, and u want to be a gay guy  you still like men?  So you want it anal?  or do you want to be the man in the relationship w/ another girl    Either way.  nothing is wrong with you  some people perfer carrots some corn and others neither  you cant change ur tastebuds can you?  well u cant change ur mind and thoughts either  Good luck!|`|zwNaZbKlaa	Maybe you are having a gender identity crisis. Do some research on gender identity and see if you should get a sex change.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	There's nothing wrong with you. Your biological gender has nothing to do with what gender you identify with inside, and it has even less to do with your sexual orientation. Much of how we identify ourselves, i.e. male/female are social norms, and much of it is dependent on how we are raised. Therefore, when your body is biologically female, and your family raises you as a female, that can have absolutely no effect on your soul and your mind and your being, which know that you were meant to be male.     There are children as young as 5 who know instinctively that they were born the wrong gender. I watched a show once about a girl who finally, at 9, convinced her family to allow her to live as a boy because she knew she was meant to be a boy. She had lived many unhappy years as a girl, even trying to kill herself, and expressing as young as 5 years old that she couldn't find her penis, that parts of her were missing, etc.     Though many people will say it's not normal, it's actually not as rare as you would think.    If you really feel it to be true, you should talk to your family. Of if you're not ready to do that, talk to a guidance counselor or psychiatrist. You may be transgendered, and you have options. You can live as a guy, even if you don't want surgery or go that extreme. You can talk about your options with a therapist. Like hormone treatment, and such.    Good luck. Remember - don't let anyone tell you that what you feel inside is wrong. You should be who you know inside that you are.|`|EShN5zNcaa	Maybe you're bi. Or you just like guy stuff.|`|tvnakxDbaa	I totally understand what you mean, I feel the same way sometimes.   My boyfriend feels like he should be a girl a lot of the time, and it's caused him to go into a severe depression :(  Just remember, be yourself.. I dont like gender bias stuff. It makes me mad!   Just be who you want to be [:|`|iGZWeWwBaa	it's soo common, trust me. I hang out with boys, dress kinda like a boy & act like a boy lol. It's normal, you prolly just feel normal being around people you are comfortable with. Just think about who you are & You'll be fine!    Some of my boyfriends have said i could've been a total guy, but i'm just me =)     Sometimes on rare cases though, you were born an "it" and the parents chose to make you a certain gender, that's what happened with one of my friends.|`|lMRiEoltaa	just ignore it it is way better to be an girl. u can do way more things that men cant do.|`|94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	What's so wrong about it? So you're a transman.    Just be what you are.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Nothing's wrong with that, at least not as far as the psychological establishment is concerned. A certain segment of the population, for a variety of reasons, will experience a degree of unease with their assigned gender. Some of these people will just be really androgynous or queer looking, while others will seek to change their external biological sex indicators and take on a different gender wholesale down to movements and customs. Some of these people, whether trans, transgender, or transsexual, will take on a gay identity when they transition. They're among the most oppressed, along with people who refuse to pass or refuse to accept gender, but I'd argue the problem is with society instead of them. Perhaps you're what's called a "trannyf**" in community lingo? I think you should explore your desire to be a gay male some more, and if you think there's really something to it, consider seeing a wpath psychiatrist.    Also, if it's the, "but that can't be me" element, note that most trans people are well-adjusted, and not everyone even undergoes hormones therapy or surgery. Different things are right for different identities.|`|0XkIHnipaa	Forget about who you want to have sex with for now, and concentrate on the "I want to be a guy" part of it.  You would know, if you wanted to wear mens clothes more than girls; if you cringed at people calling you "Maam" or "she" etc; and you felt like yelling at them; "Im a guy!" ; and if you were pleased if someone mistook you for a guy.  Theyre all the tell tale signs of a female born person being FTM (female to male transsexual).    The sex part of it can come later. Right now, the best thing to do is look at what I said above, and see if you can see yourself in any of those statements I made. If you can, then best to go firstly to join an internet group such as a yahoo group; search for "ftm support" and then join and just read some of the posts at first then ask a question, if you feel comfortable. If you can, try and find if there is a drop in group in your city, and make some friends. Id suggest that before going and seeing anyone about hormones- that way, you can test your level of comfort before going any further. The if you still feel the same, you could go and see a doctor or a gender specialist.     good luck.|`|I0xO8IAHaa	nothing its normal probably just hormones dont worry =)|`|tfsaxi0laa	Too much testosterone... lay off the steroids.

0ufpOygTaa	Science cannot test for anything not at all testable.  We can test for cognitive abilities because we have data to look at even though they are not directly visible. We can however make some good assumptions regarding the unseen spirits, given that for a very very long time none whatsoever has given us any concrete evidence that such things exists then perhaps they are most probably non-existent.    Mysticism is not a good thing. Why create a problem where non exists? Is there a benefit to be had if we prove these things? Should we waste our time dealing with something we couldn't find or should we just work with what we currently have in our accumulated knowledge and discover many interesting things in the process and perhaps, just perhaps on the way we discover proof of such things called spirit or maybe not.    We cannot always assume something 'inner' or arcane to something just because we haven't found anything.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Atheist do not believe in spirit.

But I can give reasonably valid scientific reasoning to support the idea that part of us exists outside the material plane.    Basically, because of free choice. If you believe we all have free choice in our actions and thoughts, then that part of us must be seperate from what we would call the physical - if the universe and everything in it were simply a closed system, including us, then every single thing that occurs, including the choices we make, are a direct result of whatever comes immediately before it, right back to the beginning of existence. Meaning everything that is was always going to be, and every choice we make was already set in stone.    And since I find that concept ludicrous, I can only conclude that part of us is acting on the universe as an outside influence.|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Most of us don't.

Science studies rocks.  It is not a study of philosophies, beliefs, "spirits".  The two are completely separate.      Many atheists are very spiritual, they just don't share the belief in "God" as such.      No, science can't test for an inner aspect which cannot be put to a scientific theory.      I think, therefore I am.  I think.|`|g7RnYMoNaa	Before anyone can answer this question you have to explain what you mean with the word "spirit". If it is not consciousness, what is it? And what do you mean with "inner aspect"? Also, are you sure you are not thinking of "soul"?

Although there is nothing contradictory about an atheist believing in spirits provided such spirits are not gods or god-equivalents, most atheists reject the existence of all supernatural beings and forces including spirits.    >How would science test for spirit?    I don't know. You tell me, THEN we'll test for them and see if they really exist.    >Science seem only focus on the outer aspect of thing.    No, science deals with every aspect of a thing that can be demonstrated to exist in some concrete sense of reality, everything for which it is possible to have empirical evidence. By the very definition of science, if something is 'beyond science' or 'outside of science' or 'not scientifically perceptible', then it is either an abstract concept (like things in mathematics and computation theory), or for all intents and purposes it does not exist in the first place. In other words, by the time you've admitted that it is impossible to detect and study spirits in a scientific sense, you're really just admitting that they might as well not exist for all the good they could do us.    >There is no real way of science to produce the conscious experience of a lion, they can see it brain chemistry and stuff, but it cannot get in the lion, to see what it experience is like.    Although this is getting more into philosophy, I don't see any reason why we should be inherently unable to define and describe the experience of a sentient being (such as a lion, or a person, or whatever) in terms of computation theory.    >Maybe there is an inner aspect to the whole universe? Would this be testable by science in anyway, if so how would I go about doing these test?    You are being too abstract. You can't take a vague, ambiguous term like 'inner aspect' and then suggest testing it through empirical experimentation. You need a much more concrete idea of what it is you are going to test for before you can actually do a test and get a conclusive result. You need some description of how a universe containing an 'inner aspect' would differ from a universe which did not contain it in some way that is detectable to you in a scientifically measurable way. Until then, you're pretty much on a wild goose chase.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	FOR THE LAST TIME ATHEISM AND SIANCE ARE NOT SYNONYMS!

HJ9eOk37aa	Since you picked this line off below URL, I assume I don't have to explain to you what procedural language is or what OOP is.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL    Basically what it says is :    SQL/PSM and proprietary SQL extensions will allow you to construct SQL queries in both procedural and OOP manner.    Other programming languages also allow you to use SQL. Many languages (Visual Basic, Delphi, C++) also have the capability to connect to databases and use SQL via things like ADO.    Message me if you need further explanation.|`|RxJjDArSaa	In addition to the commonly know extensions for SQL, there are other functions/methods available in different SQL platforms (depending on the programming language and database used).    *sorry I don't know how familiar you are with comp/programming terms .. hope this helps*

Oh, there isn't any overpopulation problem. There are parts of my country - Canada - which are still barely populated even today.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	If that was the case, wouldn't GOd have controlled men's sex drive too so neither wanted to hump all the time?    A woman only needs one man to get pregnant. It is in her best interest to want him around to help her out.    A man has the instinct to reproduce as much as possible and the only limit is how many uteruses he can find.|`|dFBccLExaa	I agree with someone else- we already have an overpopulation problem.   Before Christianity came around, and it was more of a matriarchal society, women had just as much as a sexual appetite as men. So it's kind of a stereotype to say that men want sex more than women.

It only takes only a few men, but many women to continue the human species.  Human gestation is 9 months.  During that time one oversexed man can get countless women pregnant and have countless children. But a woman is limited in how many children she can bear.   Women's lower sex drive is probably much more related to their understanding of what the consequences of sex are, ie. raising and protecting their offspring.  It's in a woman's interest to find a man that will help her raise her children, and not every man is going to.     Realistically I think the sociology of human interaction is as important as the biological implications of sex drive. Women's and men's sex drives are determined by individual physical, emotional and other factors, as well as societal expectations.  There are so many things that affect sex drive, not just the ingrained instinct to reproduce.  And there are many countries with overpopulation problems now.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	Um... maybe you haven't noticed but we are overpopulated.

vquwiGegaa	Everyone has the potential to be a President, a doctor and a lawyer or whatever, but obviously not everyone can become what our potential can be.    A dog may have the Buddha Nature just like every other sentient being, but just being an animal severely limit its ability to have the wisdom to become Enlightened, that is why Animal Path is consider one of the three negative paths.    Being born in Animal Realm- "Stupidity" is one of its set back and as result this "Stupidity", those sentient beings born into this realm may take forever to get out of this path.     But then again "Stupidity" is not in shortage in our human realm either, that is why to be Enlightenment in human world is such a rare occasion as well; to be exact many humans who cannot conduct themselves above animals conducts will fall into the animal realm in next incarnation.    As to your dog, which licks its booty, is just being a dog doing what its doing best by keeping its body part sanitary without taking a shower. The conduct is a good reminder to you, so that you can see the horrible consequence, if you become an animal just like your dog.    If you can learn from your dog and realize the truth of Samsara, and then actively seek ways to get out of the Cycles of Samsara, then your dog may even be a high level being, may be even a Bodhisattva (who has a strong connection to you) to show you how not to be foolish enough to fall into the wrong paths.     Do you also remember aside from animals' realm, there are two other even less desirable paths to fall into (Hungry Ghosts and Hells' Beings paths)? So take a hint from your dog and be the best Buddhist you can, may be someday you'll thank both your dog and this Yahoo answerer.|`|AA11640108	That is a Zen dog. =)    Apparently the dog definitely loses itself in the activity and is truly one with the universe.

So what does it say about human when some human are so evil? Or when some human are so kind? Or when some human are mad? Or when some human are so dumb? Or when some human are so smart?    Thus, having the same consciousness only mean that one has the same capabilities -- be it evil, kind, mad, dumb, smart e.t.c are all due to the functioning of consciousness. It says nothing what a particular person is.    Similarly, saying a Dog has Buddha consciousness only mean that in future (lives), the dog may become a Buddha. Reversely, we as a human, if we walk the wrong path, we could become the Dog. This is because we still have greed, anger and ignorance (same as dog). But Buddha, after eliminating greed, anger and ignorance, he is enlightened and would never become a Dog or human anymore -- because the root causes to become one have been eliminated.     Buddha, unlike any other religious teachings, know clearly that every sentient beings can become another Buddha, thus he said that all sentient beings (including a dog) has Buddha consciousness. You should understand this correctly.|`|E3v6Ctffaa	There are many type of Buddhisms , most are religious (exemple Mahayana - Vajrayana etc)    The original teachings of Buddha is the science of reality , unfortunatly it is almost instinct , messup in a sea of contradiction , religious stuff , rituals , prayers.    Himself told the monks 2500 years ago that his teachings would degrade quite rapidly and become nothing more then a human invention , interpretations mixed with more interpretations.

Usually the tribal region was their last names, so I used the name their new slave master probably gave them as their surname.    Also note, that most slaves were not "Sold" into slavery. If that were the case then West Africa should have jails built by Africans that could hold millions of people. Also, these lands were also conquered by the various European nations.

f0JLp4hFaa	Creationists couldn't deny evidence like this, so they finally gave ground and said "ok, we believe in MICROevolution, but not MACROevolution."    You even have one silly answerer saying "well, evolution may be true, but it can't explain how the first life formed, so THERE!".  That's like saying "I don't believe weather forecasting works because it can't explain where the atmosphere came from."  Lame lame lame, ignorant, and lame.      Of course, if macroevolution were false, if all species were created in completed forms, then we wouldn't find any intermediate or transitional species.  Creationism needs no intermediate species.    Alas for the creationists, transitional species are everywhere!  The fossil record is MUCH richer than the vast majority of close-minded, dogmatic creationists believe.  For example:    An exhaustive (and exhausting) list of text descriptions of transitional fossils between many different major classes of vertebrates:  http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-tran...    Nice readable document about the fossil evidence of continuous transformations from one species to the next:  http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/lessons/...    Powerful video on "transitional species denial" by creationists, and how utterly ridiculous it is:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfoje7jVJ...    Additional links, with pictures:  Reptile to Mammal Transition:  http://www.gcssepm.org/special/cuffey_05...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodont  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrinaxodon     Reptile to Bird Transition:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yixianosaur...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeopter...    And my personal favorite.  Because of evolutionary theory, we're able to look at gaps in the fossil record of transitional species and predict when an undiscovered species lived, and where it lived.  We can then go out and find it, thus proving again that evolution WORKS:  http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/searching4...    (click the 'next' button to page through this easy-to-follow story)    So, I've quoted a tiny fraction of the available information on the countless transitional species that provide inescapable and unrelenting proof that species evolved over time.  There is so much more information to be found in books and research papers, all backed by tangible, physical evidence analyzed under the light of rational thought.    A claim made without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.  -- Christopher Hitchens (paraphrased)    Creationism can be dismissed without evidence because it offers none.  The theory of evolution, on the other hand, grows stronger every day.|`|15Wld3wCaa	what exactly is your argument? are you for or against creationism?    pro evolution- its real                        con- it hurts some    pro creationism- it cant be proved or disproved    con- people disregard science|`|OKydqqeeaa	no proof its a fish|`|qCdRgRweaa	If we put creationism to bed, it might wake up again.

To say the world created itself is to say something created that,that created the world, nonsensical.

So just say, something created the world and was aways there,ie eternal,and as humans are finite, we cannot comprehend the infinite,ie a god or creator.

Those of us who are famiiar with the Rift Lake cichlids have long been aware that the things hybridise with remarkable ease; this has been responsible for a great deal of confusion with regard to their taxonomy for generations. The Haps are famous for it, as are others, like Labidochromis which occur in very distintive colour varieties.    It's also worth noting that, since the introduction of the Nile Perch to the Rift Lakes back in the 50's, something like 200 species of Hap have become extinct. Pundamilia itself was shifted from the Haplochromis group and gained inclusion on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Nyerere has also been scattered across the Rift Lake system in efforts to forestall it's extinction while local fishermen have been encouraged to over-fish the nile perch in an effort to keep it's numbers down.    Hardly a glowing example of the processes of natural selection, eh?    It is far from proof of anything at all.    Unless, of course, you count the way that humans have created massive ecological problems in and around the Rift Lakes.|`|vqFJlTN5aa	I thought it already was put to bed.  I mean, c'mon!

To the point were I searched up a fatwa for those who are believers,     And remind them, for truly the believers benefit from being reminded. (Surat adh-Dhariyat: 55)  http://www.islamqa.com/en/ref/50687/musi...    know that...    Those who took their religion as a diversion and a game, and were deluded by the life of the world. Today We will forget them just as they forgot the encounter of this Day and denied Our Signs. (Surat al-A'raf: 51)    Honestly, it took me a while to drop the music thing. For a long time I was allowed to listen to music under the condition that it contained clean lyrics and no sexual references.     Once i grew up enough to look into islam more, i discovered the errors of music. I remember my dad once saying to me, have you ever watched them dancing to the music they listen to with the sound muted? LOL, i remembered that and how funny i thought they looked. Seriously though, THEY LOOKED POSSESSED.     and that's what they were. simple as that.    I began to notice the effect of music in the mind. How it stays locked in there and you can be doing anything, including prayer, and just one whisper brings back a line from the lyrics, which in turn brings the song etc...     So my heart was being blocked. My mind was no longer controllable by me. I lost myself. And people listen to music to loose themselves.     Islam doesn't want you to lose. Therefore I slowly slowly, gave it all up.    Alhamdulellah, I've deleted all the songs (and yea it took a while for that too) and replaced it with lectures that benefit me soo much more. My husband and I decided no tv in our home, but occasionally we do watch a good movie on the computer with our daughter.     Quran is something that should never be taken for granted. The recitations are beautiful and the meanings are huge. There's this saying i love so much for my fellow sisters and brothers...    "Verily, each verse is like a date: the more you chew it, the more of its sweetness is released." - - - Bishr bin as-Sirri    Since then, I promise you we have total control of our lives. (And alhamdulellah my husband doesn't listen to music either) Our minds are now OURS, our bodies don't become detached from us. I feel clean, because my mind is clean.     And for those that say music is healthy. There are many other healthier things out their for your mind, body and soul. Just like Allah created more than one way to obtain your vitamin C, protein, potassium, etc.. (if someone's allergic to banana's, great source of potassium, they can always take tomatoes), if someone looks for a way to save themselves they have lots of ways to do it. Some may resort to ending their lives so they don't have to suffer anymore, and some may realize their true purpose.     Simple as that. lol...|`|xXFryTGqaa	it hasn't... what religion has u stop listening to music?|`|8KMdXKTLaa	if i ever stopped listening to music...i'd be a sad sad person    music is so natural to humans...why would anyone want to stop it????|`|hPBMwEr5aa	Personally there is NO way I could live without music! literally.

i6Mi8uWIaa	It's a ring worn to show that you plan to wait until marriage to have sex.    It was recently popularized by the Jonas Brothers, but they existed for a very long time before that.    They are also commonly given by fathers to their daughters at purity balls, which is a father-daughter dance at which a father pledges to be a good example to his daughter by remaining faithful to her mother and not ever watching/reading porn and walking a straight and narrow life, and the daughter pledges to wait until she is married to have sex, and to seal this promise, the father gives his daughter a purity ring.     Purity rings come in various designs, for both males and females, and in various price ranges.    Contrary to what detractors will claim, teens who promise to remain pure until marriage actually have a LOWER incidence of teen pregnancy and STDs.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	Heather H is right.

8cde047a2197080a0f253d0aeebe83d1aa	This question can't really be answered.  We don't know your friend, we don't know her character, we don't know how close you are, we don't know if it will last, etc.      All I can say is that you should consider these following elements when you make your decision:    --At 15, your peers are not very mature.  Having this get out when you're in high school actually will weird a lot of people out at your age.  When you're an adult, it won't be a big deal.    --A foot fetish is pretty tame.  It's just not a big deal.  There's no way that a good, real friend who actually likes you for who you are would stop liking you because of something that harmless.  Anyone who actually would react that way (and even at 15 I'd imagine that would be very rare) is obviously not much of a friend anyway.    And you'll also want to weigh things like how much you trust her, how close you are, how long you've known each other, and whether or not it would hurt if she did think of it as "weird," even if she still accepted you as a friend, etc.  But you're the one who will have to assess the situation and decide if whatever risk exists is worth it.    If you do decide to tell her, the only advice I can give is not to act like you're ashamed of it.  Don't apologize for it, don't stutter when you say it, just act like this is perfectly normal for you.  Because it is.  And acting like it's something to be ashamed of only gives people the impression that it is.|`|hZiwiboRaa	You don't have to tell anyone.    What exactly is a foot fetish?|`|swkhohjgaa	In my humble opinion. I don't think you should tell anyone that close.     If things go wrong ( and they often do) everyone in your school could end up knowing your secret.     Kids at your age can be very mean and really cant keep a secret.     Once its out there, theres no putting it back.

There are Blacks that have proven that we are capable of being intelligent and doing our (positive) part in society, but we are still outcasted because of our features.     Italians are generally seen as attractive (and in my opinion, many of them are very arrogant about it, so I personally do not like them).|`|AA10232076	Qualifications and charisma usually play bigger roles than race.|`|Nwno6n70aa	what italian man ran for president?  tick tock tick tock
f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	1. The one-drop rule is a load of crap.  It's based on the idea that, because a lot of people who have one Black parent and one White parent tend to Black, therefore they should be called Black.    2. It's genetically unsound.  Black blood isn't any stronger than any other blood.    3. It most likely came into play when biracial peope were trying to enjoy the rights that Whites had.  They were then told that, because they had Black blood, they were Black.    4. Look at this link:http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...  Does she look 'Black'?  She's biracial (Black and White)    EDIT: If you add a drop of ink to a glass of milk, sure the milk is not completely white anymore, but it's not pure Black either.|`|lPPgMKibaa	its "if there is 1 drop of black blood you are black"   haha wow, its pretty stupid.   i think whatever you are most of, you should be that race., if you are mixed, then you choose.|`|tYtJDXaQaa	There is no more One-Drop Rule. Race is done by self-selection. People essentially choose their own race.|`|OZjlW5utaa	It used to be a law used to get more slaves and call anyone black with any known black 'blood' in them, no matter how light your skin was because they thought white was too precious too be mixed with. Some ignorant people use it now as a judgement, some don't.|`|AA10866651	Basically, the one-drop rule started out as a law initiated by the U.S. government during early slavery.      Two-hundred and some-odd years ago, Thomas Jefferson created the various levels of "blackness" (mulatto, quadroon, octaroon), mainly as a way of deciding which of his descendants were "black" (and therefore slaves) and which ones were "white".  Thomas Jefferson's political enemies and other rich slave owners created the "one-drop" rule as a means of ensuring that the descendants of their African slaves would remain slaves, and therefore chattel property.      The whole point of the one-drop rule was that if anyone could be proven to have even "one drop" of black blood, then they were automatically considered "black" and therefore could be bound into slavery and/or have their basic rights as a free American citizen revoked.      The one-drop rule was LEGALLY applied in various states throughout the U.S. after the Civil War all the way through the 50's into the 60's as a means of enforcing Jim Crow and Segregation and anti-voting laws and whatnot.  It only really ended as a legal instrument in the early 70's after the end of the Civil Rights era.|`|7sgJuukQaa	This is generally the definition:  The one-drop rule is a historical colloquial term in the United States that holds that a person with any trace of African ancestry is considered black unless having an alternative non-white ancestry which he or she can claim, such as Native American, Asian, Arab, or Australian aboriginal.[1] It developed most strongly out of the binary culture of long years of institutionalized slavery.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-drop_ru...|`|uC2Whritaa	But it applies, don't you think? If you ad one drop of black paint to a puddle of white, you'll never get that whiteness back again, right? It gets all muddied. Ugh, just like it's so hard to keep my perfect white shirt clean and white.    O and the google photo above, she's dangerous because she's now a racial time bomb. Just because she doesn't show it fully (she can pass for hispanic), doesn't mean her kids won't turn out to be muddied.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Honestly I think it's subjective judgement
Zbn8A7Geaa	The obvious reason is privacy.  Not all people want to share their bathroom activities with members of the opposite sex. Nor do they want to possibly expose themselves or in the alternative accidentally be flashed by someone of the opposite sex.    Another reason is legal and a question of liability -- someone could claim that they were sexually harassed while in the bathroom and if they were the only two people in the room, it would be a "he said, she said" kind of a deal resulting in a big mess legally.  The same of course could be said for same sex bathrooms, but such a charge would hold less "weight" and/or probability legally speaking.|`|rThIVk2maa	Privacy, discretion, dignity, modesty and comfort... that covers it.|`|77Ng0HT8aa	um.. bc it would be really awkward if you are peeing in a stall and right outside is a dude in a urnial with his peeny hanging out.

EBGdlo35aa	It is a clear reference to the creation account, in which God caused everything to come into being just by speaking.    The word (Greek "logos")  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...  does not necessarily mean an actual single word, but rather is used in the same sense as in the phrase "the word of God" (which also is not referring to a single word).    Whether or not "the word" is audible is a matter for conjecture.  After all, when God "spoke" to create the earth, there was no atmosphere.  Sound travels through a physical medium (gas, liquid or solid), not through space or "void".    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|FOZGMadaaa	No!|`|v6nISGeUaa	Theologians actually say it was an "utterance" from God. That He merely said a single syllable and made everything....

What's your relationship been with her up til now?  Maybe she doesn't believe in Valentines Day (I know I don't anymore).  Try texting her tomorrow casually and see if she responds.  If she does ask her if she got the message and to just be honest with you.  Us girls are funny that way.  Sometimes things can move too fast for us too just like guys, and we have to back away a bit.  Good luck, hopefully you met her at the werepire convention like I told you.  If that is the case, maybe she needed to hunt because she was hungry?|`|Tr8dBg8Saa	Why the "lol"?    I'm sorry that she didn't respond...maybe you should have asked her in person. I think that it shows you're more serious when you ask a girl to her face.     See how things are tomorrow with her. Good luck|`|48Yf8tpsaa	You have to do something real cute now.. and fast. That's no way to ask a woman to be your valentine.. get your skrawny lil butt over there and say it in person.. else she wont know if you are serious... or even if it was you that wrote it!    If she rejects you, then that's ok too... it's good practice. Remember you don't get if you don't ever ask!

She has now has concluded her thesis on the subject of medical English through analysing a corpus of research articles. She has carried out her work seriously and independently, showing a deep interest in the topic. As a student,she has gone the extra mile by participating in a conference on the subject. She showed precision, attention to detail and a desire for knowledge. Her chosen curriculum has born excellent results, particularly in areas relating to English language and literature, a proof of the great interest which she has for the language and culture of the United Kingdom. I support her candidature to the post of Italian-speaking assistant in an English school. I believe that a practical and full immersion experience like this can help her broaden her cultural horizons, make her grow personally and professionally in her future work as an English teacher.    As a reference for a student to carry out further studies in a British university this would be a good recommendation , but as a potential teacher it says very little about her personality.  You should add something like the following sentence:  "I am confident that she will be an asset to any establishment that employs her."  ( She should not be the only person getting something out of her nomination: employing her should also benefit whoever takes her on. Your recommendation demonstrates that she has been a good student but does not say anything about her character. Is she pleasant, patient, dynamic, versatile, adaptable, good at communication, willing to help others? Is she liked by tutors and other students? Is she likely to integrate fully in the various activities of a school? Is she reliable and punctual? Has she got other talents than her degree that you know of? Does she look smart  and neat in her appearance? Does she accept advice or criticism?  Her qualifications speak for themselves, but her personality is important too.)

I have an american accent, but I can fake a british accent, a chinese one, maybe even a scottish accent.  It just takes practice, and after a while it won't be practice, it'll just be the way you sound.|`|AzeOk29saa	Visit another country.  I'm from NoVa so most people here have no accent whatsoever, but when i visited London for a week, numerous people started to speak with a British accent unintentionally.

It should be noted that Egypt was conquered prior by Alexander the Great and the Pharaoh Ptolemy was a Macedonian general who took Egypt after Alexander's death.  He created the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the first lighthouse built and the tall ancient wonder second only to the great Pyramids..|`|AA10959177	She had a great asp.|`|AA12164862	Cleopatra changed history's perception of women.  She was an evil temptrous with an attitude but was also a "feminist hero and female politician."  Cleopatra changed the way men and society percieved women and their role in society.  She actually had Rome afraid of the Egyptian Empire.  She was an actavist, amoral Queen and she was driven with a ruthless lust for power and she used her sexuality to get it. When the Roman Empire finally did conquer Egypt, they used Cleopatra's image as a sign of their own military and cultural superiority.  Cleopatra was the epitomy of "female power".|`|q3kJ6x8raa	She was the last one to rule in the Hellenistic Era and what started was the Roman Era and was also the first one in her descendants to learn the Egyptian language, as they usually spoke Greek.

rP6k9WLuaa	People don't say Spanish if you are hispanic yourself, that doesn't count. I am hispanic and I never took spanish but I took French from 7th grade to my freshman semester in college. I got AP credit and everything. It gets challenging but my friends are hispanic and had a tough time with spanish class so I'm going to say, French is easier. Just please remember to memorizr the foundations of the grammar and verb conjugation and you will be good when you learn more advanced french. The endings to words are very easy to guess. Like, teachER,proffessOR,pastOR, anything that sounds like that is "eur". "professeur,pasteur,fleur" so like I said, pay attention when you learnt the basics and you'll catch patterns later on.|`|ksIwM3m1aa	Spanish.|`|kfHT6v4maa	spanish bcuz french has some spanish in it so u would know what people were saying in french if u passed it through spanish first|`|hzQHwIGMaa	everyone says Spanish is easier but it really isn't. i take french in school and it is really easy for me. my cousin takes Spanish and she says its really hard and she tried to teach me some of the stuff and it was really hard to understand. french is a much prettier language too. go with french.|`|T7zUL6Faaa	I think you gotta choose spanish.

Most kids in my school when I started a langauge only took Spanish because it was "easier". Neither are "easy" because there is no such thing as an "easy" language.

Hr2tnZtqaa	Nostradamus has nothing to do with the end of the Mayan calender . In fact his end of the world  prediction is well into  3000's.  As far as Nostradamus is concerned there are those that  question on weather he predicted anything. His predictions are vague and  can fit  other many other events.

He also predicts great destruction from the LHC in his prophecy century 9 quatrain 44|`|i0OVwfcyaa	Such a prophecy does not exist.  The kook Nostradamus never mentioned 2012.

As far as the Mayan calender goes, it was based off of time, and our universe and they didn't just decide to end it, they predicted that the universe would come to an end on December 21, 2012. There is also a Chinese prophecy called the i-ching (not exact spelling I'm sure) that was based off of money and statistics that also ended on december 21, 2012. Look it up :)|`|ff4fdc55e4134a54a6545ed164302405aa	He had predictions that have come true however many thought that he had lost his mind and that he was influenced by demons. His theory is that the world would end in 2012. The Bible states "no man knows the day of the hour" I tend to take the Bible at its word.

I think there are inappropriate times that it calls for telling someone to get off the phone.|`|4INE794zaa	No, because I am not rude enough to be blabbing away on the phone in inappropriate places. I have, however, told many a people to get off their phone..........Yelled it out my car window at an idiot swerving in and out of the lanes because he's chatting about what happened on TV the previous night. Told some one to hang it up in a store check out line, as the line grows behind them, because they are too busy having a fight with their significant other to dig their wallet out. Told someone on the bus to hang it up, as they are gossipping about who f**ked who, in front of little kids......There is a time and place for cell phones. They are a great invention. Unfortunately lots of people use them in the wrong places.      *Not to mention if you are chatting on your phone as you are about to pay for your items, thats pretty disrespectful to the cashier, like they are a non existent, unimportant nothing, only here to serve you.

How nice of them not to mind !!!  I will be giving a present.  I enjoy using the gifts that were given to me at my wedding, they have sentimental value especially as several of the givers have now died.   People can do a gift registry so we are aware what they want, and we can purchase parts of sets for them, if too expensive.  There is no reason why anyone should have to request cash.     However to answer your question,  you should give a minimum of what your and your partner/children's attendance would cost.  i.e.   2 adults for dinner and free drinks  $50 a head (i'm guessing here, depends on where they are going, dinner/lunch/snacks etc), therefore $100 absolute minimum.   If you are happy give more.   According to my invitation  ? gift of money is placed in the well,  Then make a wish but do not tell"   Therefore implying that no name be placed there.

ad08fe27604f983a2b098f5c3a9bdfa5aa	It's a perfectly reasonable question given some of the things that some people say and you have probably heard.      Big bang theory has nothing to do with rejection of religion, in fact it is the reverse.  It was first proposed in the 1930s as the "primeval atom" theory by Monsignor Georges Lemaitre, a Roman Catholic astronomer and priest.  Monsignor Lemaitre was attempting to account for the fact that all distant galaxies appear to be receding from each other, meaning that the Universe was expanding.      He was wrong in some of his intitial ideas but that is common with brand new theories.  Einstein told Lemaitre that it was one of the best ideas he had heard.      Since the theory meant there was a definite start to the Universe we see, it was also consistent with the account of creation in Genesis in at least one way.    A number of scientists who were atheists at the time proposed an alternate theory in which the Universe expanded because tiny amounts of matter were appearing everywhere all the time through quantum effects, quantum theory can allow this. Since this appearance of matter would be very slow, that theory meant the Universe we see was already close to infinitely old.  This theory was proposed about 1948 by Fred Hoyle and a few others.  Hoyle was a thorough atheist then but got the idea after watching a movie based on Hindu or Buddhist ideas!    Calculations based on the big bang / primeval atom idea predicted the Universe would be filled with microwave radiation, most of it in a very small range of wavelengths consistent with a universal temperature of about 2 to 3 degrees above absolute zero. Later, this was called the Cosmic Microwave Background.  (CMB) The continuous creation theory did not predict this.    In 1964 - 65 two radio astronomers, Penzias and Wilson, working for Bell Laboratories were trying to tune up a sensitive antenna meant to be used with communications satellites which were being built then.  They found some radio noise that they could not get rid of, so they measured the wavelengths and went to see an academic astronomer.  This astronomer recognised that the noise the two found was the predicted CMB.  Since then it has been measured many times and found to coincide so exactly with theory that you cannot tell the difference between predicted and measured.      Therefore Hoyle was wrong and Lemaitre or those who basically agreed with his original idea were right.      Since then there has been other evidence based on research into hydrogen bombs (which are devices that work) which predicted the approximate chemical composition of the Universe if the big bang theory was correct.  Spectroscopic measurements show that the chemical composition of stars and distant galaxies is very close to the predicted one, the differences being due to the creation of all elements heavier than boron inside stars.      That, ironically, was worked out by Fred Hoyle.  That probably should have got him a Nobel Prize for Physics, but it didn't. He did become Sir Fred Hoyle though.  Even more ironically Fred Hoyle became religious as a result of that work but still tried to get round the objections to his continuous creation theory.      Events soon after the big bang would have meant the Universe was filled with radiation, much of that would have been visible to us.  So it is consistent with "Let there be light"!     The problem some Christians have with the big bang theory and other recent science is that it does not agree with the idea of the Universe being created in 6 days of 24 hours each,  just several thousand years ago.  But geology, nuclear physics, astronomy, biology, and paleontology all agree that the Earth is far older than several thousand years.      Science does not address the question of "who" or "why".  It is mostly about "how".      Many of those who object to say evolution are quite wrong about what evolution says.  Evolution is about the way different species of animals, plants, bacteria and so forth appeared, starting from some original living forms.  It has nothing to say about the origin of life.     Even Charles Darwin wrote this in his book "On the Origin of Species".  See the "entangled bank" paragraph which comes from the last pages of the book.  "Evolved" is the last word in the book and that is the only time Darwin used it!      Another problem with what they say is that there is no necessary connection between whether evolution is right or wrong and whether they are right or wrong.  Even if they could show that evolution or the big bang theory was wrong, it still would not mean they are right.  The answer could be something else again.  There are usually more than two possibilities.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Ah!! another who thinks they are christian but is heavily criticized by the church!!    Science explains the big bang was not from nothing but from a singularity that was all the matter and energy in the universe compressed into a single point that then expanded rapidly!!    So in answer to your question it was always here!!    The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!    Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well  Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth!!     What does it feel like to be the subject of ridicule from christians and atheists together?!!|`|i6d582PFaa	The origin of existence is the absolute principle.|`|1oYjjp0Daa	An atheist is someone who does not believe in god.  It is not a qualification in Physics.    Atheists in general tend to believe facts and evidence.  The Big Bang Theory is supported by all known and verifiable facts and evidence - that's why most atheists support the Big Bang Theory.    The nature of the Big Bang Theory is such that it is not possible to calculate or estimate what happened before the Big Bang.  It is only possible to work out how it happened from the first few pico-seconds onwards. In that instant a singularity of sufficient density and energy appeared and rapidly expanded into the Universe.  The appearance of a singularity from nothing tends to sound implausible until you understand Quantum Physics (see under "getting an education" for more details)|`|5cd72c27261c5c994c0b5c7e6eed47dfaa	What happened before the Big Bang is unknown. I'm not an astrophysicist, so I can't offer a hypothesis. But atheism itself is only about the lack of belief in deities.|`|IBeEeu9oaa	atheism is not a religion, does not provide all of the answers, and is not mutually exclusive with science-    BTW- Scientology has NOTHING to do with Astronomy.

I suggest you also get a dictionary and look up satire or are you too stupid to see when someone is joking|`|LqyOHY37aa	Atheism doesn't address the origins of life or even evolution. It simply states that they lack a belief in a god. Anything outside of that definition is void.|`|b4d86f4161f7fd0e73ccc2742d82adeaaa	The Big Bang is not part of atheism.  Atheism is the disbelief in the existence of thousands of gods.  That's it.|`|CT265lQyaa	Did you not get a sixth grade education?

I just don't believe that there is a supreme being, heaven/hell, devine/evil, etc. I believe that I control my life. Not faith or fate but I have free will to do as I please and I reap what I sew.|`|txhRsUe6aa	ive got to be honest i don't have a clue, but neither can my mind comprehend infinity and i dont believe many of us can understand these things, there are just somethings we have to accept that we are ignorant about. AHA I hear you think, this sounds very much like the christian argument that whilst there is no evidence that god exists "we must have faith", but it is not. i am not saying that i definately have the answer to anything (even though there is no evidence) im saying i cant prove anything god wise but nor can i not prove him to exist, i am happy with my ignorance and don't need made up stories to give me answers that may be wrong and in the god scenario most probably are wrong.

aymBTRlyaa	patinar - great job trying it out before you asked. :-))))  Mi familia y yo vamos al campo (or vamos a acampar) esta noche    Good job  I'm very happy that you are trying, not just on here for answers to HW that you can do yourself like others.    Also, for future reference you can think of it like this. A spanish verb such as patinar is in the form: to skate. So if you think of it, I love to skate, me encanta patinar (to skate). Just like english. Encanta is already conjugated, so you don't need to conjugate the second.    Patino is actually the present yo form meaning "I skate" or if there is an accent on the O it is in past tense for el, ella, ud.    These other people are giving you wrong advice.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	I love to skate = Me encanta patinar    "patino" is the past form of "to skate".    My family and I are going camping this evening = Mi familia y yo vamos a ir de camping esta noche.    Informally you can use "camping" (an English word) in Spanish as it's well known. But if you want to be more formal, it can be translated as "acampar".    Mi familia y yo vamos a ir a acampar esta noche.|`|eoDWzUNxaa	You pretty much got it its:                   Me encanta patinar.   (patino is past tense)                               Mi familia y yo vamos ir de camping esta noche.    Other then a few grammer errors you're heading in the right direction :)

At the Last Supper, He blessed bread and gave it to His disciples and said to them "Take this, all of you, and eat it, for this is my body, which shall be given up for you." and when supper was over he took the chalice and said "Take this, all of you, and drink. It is my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant, which will be poured out for you." At both instances He commanded His apostles to "Do this, in memory of me."     I and other Catholics do what Christ commanded every Sunday when we partake in the Holy Eucharist, the body and blood of Christ. We do this because Christ commanded it.    Those who say that Christ only meant it to be symbolism either don't know what they're talking about or are claiming that Christ meant something other than what he said or are claiming that Christ knew not what He said.    If they are claiming that Christ didn't know what He said, then they are committing blasphemy.    If they are claiming that Christ meant other than what He said, then they are calling Christ a liar, and committing an even worse form of blasphemy.    The Eucharist is the highest form of sacrifice possible in Christ's name.|`|M7m6mRphaa	Jesus is a fairy tale, and the bible was written by man not god, so when are people going to realize this|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	I wrote Jesus a check for a million dollars.

2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	In all honesty, the risks that black women face in dating white men tend to exceed any sort of "reward."     So if a black woman is dating a white man, you can best believe it is usually because of genuine love for that man and not because of any sort of 'arrangement' or social benefit!    I can't really speak for others...but I don't date anyone for "benefits" or to gain socially. I date a person because I have a genuine affinity for the individual person and we share common goals and values...and I want to get to know them better.  Same as anyone else.  Too bad others can't understand and respect that.    Anyway, I believe that the reason why you see fewer BW/WM relationships than other types of I/R relationships is because of the tremendous and overwhelming pressure put on black women not to date outside the race...and some black women, despite wanting to have love and companionship in their lives, simply aren't willing to go against the sociopolitical tide as it were.      From the time most black women are pre-teens, we're told to stick to your own kind. We're told if you date a white man you are dating "the oppressor" and then the subject of slavery is brought up...about how the slaveholders would use the black women...and then people try to imply that if a black woman dates a white guy she's supposedly wanting to be enslaved again...which is just ridiculous IMO.    Social engineering makes it to where black women are expected to be the de facto standard bearer for the race, and the actions of one supposedly reflect on the actions of all.    Seems like we Black women can't make a single solitary MOVE without having to consider first whether or not we're going to "credit" or "disgrace" our race. This goes for everything from how we wear our hair, the music we listen to, the books we ready, to whom we date or marry.   I know that sounds old fashioned, but that pressure for black women to toe the line is still out there...and god help the ones who won't "follow the rules"  they're reminded very quickly about it!     In many cases, black women who date outside the race are taking a greater risk of social ostracism against them...and it is usually the black woman who is criticized or condemned outright. The white man is seldom if ever criticized to his face.  If anything, he's portrayed as the hapless victim of those "scheming, graspy, golddigging" black women...never mind if he's the one who actually approached first...that's not how some in society see it!    At best, black women who date outside the race get accused of every terrible thing in the book, from being a golddigger to being morally loose.  All you have to do is go onto youtube and you'll see a variety of people of varying races just criticizing black women for dating white men...but yet they don't say anything about anyone else dating outside of their race. It's like everyone else is allowed to be happy with whom they love....except for Black women!     At worst, they take their own lives into their hands. Some people in their anger and hatred have gone so far as to vandalize homes and even physically attack and murder black women who have dated or married outside of their race! On Christmas Day 1978 in San Diego County, California, a black woman Marine was murdered in her room...and that case only got solved this past year, despite the fact the over the years her killer told a number of people the reason why he killed the woman because he was angry that she was dating a white guy! He basically bragged about this killing...yet NO ONE ever reported him!  That says a lot about what people think of I/R relationships, don't you think?    Is it any wonder that murder was treated as a cautionary tale?    Sadly, history has seemed to repeat itself. this past October another BW/WM interracial couple was brutally murdered in their own home in Riverside, CA. For some reason, the media and the legal authorities won't call it a hate crime, but their parents and nearly everyone else is.|`|WYo59zLOaa	We have to prove to them that we are not racist and we date black people, regarless of how ghetto they are.|`|i48kxrbaaa	i dunno, im black and i've dated outside my race, more so than inside my race.|`|c8f2b08d3fd8fb61fb9b5b49572c858faa	if you are doing it to gain or benefit, then something is wrong with you.  love should be the only motive, not status.|`|uQfJukisaa	Most black women tend not to be up too white mens standards. And even the black women that are up too white mens standards are too busy bitching about how black men are dating white women to see that a decent white man wants them.    A lot of black women don't like dating white men. They are waiting around for the black men and do not like dating outside their race.|`|TDLdVmqEaa	It shouldn't be about a reward or a benefit, it should be about love.

Now that I think of it I've kinda seen not as many black male/white female.  I guess it depends on where you are.    It shouldn't even matter what ethnicity you are.

lfnjwpu1aa	Brought up the above link and this young lady is very good, and I loved the beat of the music.  The most popular musical form in El Salvador is the cumbia, a style that originated in Colombia. A typical cumbia is performed with a male singer (usually a high baritone or tenor) backed by a male chorus, drums (primarily kettledrum and bass drum), electric guitar and bass, and either a brass section or an accordion. The 2/4 beat is slower than most Latin music; the baseline is heavy and up-front. A very danceable musical form, it is popular with non-Latin audiences.  Ranchera music, which originated in Mexico, is also well liked by the country people in El Salvador. In the cities, many people listen to rock and rap music from the United States. Mexican American musical styles such as salsa, merengue, and tejano music have become increasingly popular among Salvadorans in the United   Alvaro Torres, a popular singer of Spanish-language romantic ballads, was born in El Salvador and lived in Guatemala and Mexico before moving to the United States.

VhHVhdnzaa	For the context I guess she meant "pibn" with B.  A "piba" is a girl and a "pibe" is a boy. A "pibn" is the superlative. Both "piba" and "pibe" change to masculine "pibn" but it can either mean "Hot boy" or "Hot girl", depending on whom are you speaking about.

JI7NQ9TNaa	Assuming this is a serious question.    When I was back in college, we had an exchange student from England. She was a sweet girl...but because they aren't deodorant users, not only did she smell of perspiration, but her clean clothing did too.     She thought we were all odd...but once she got interested in an a Yank, she took up deodorant.      My two cents.    When she went back home, it took her weeks to get used to how people form London smelled again.    And oh please...we make women SHAVE nearly every part of their body...including the stuff they need to stop infections...all to be "hot". At least deodorant is gender neutral.      I tried going "deodorant" free for a month once...but the scent was so acrid I couldn't stand myself.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	Firstly , take a both regularly .  Deodorants are not meant to camouflage several days of not bath. They are there to get you through the moment, say a meeting or a date.    The Doe stick, which you wipe under the arm pit actually prevents the sweat glads from perspiring. These needs to be washed off when you get home,    The other spray on type is to neutralize the odor to let you get through the moment.|`|FMyd4IoZaa	Trust me, by using Deoderant you're doing everybody around you a favor. And YES, it is definately necessary. It probably irritates you because you're allergic to the specfic kind you are using. try and different one and see.|`|YX93lq4daa	If it gives you rashes and boils you are allergic to all the chemicals in it..and yes deodorant is FILLED with all kinds of chemicals. It would be best to either make your own or go to a health store and get some organic stuff.|`|aPxmZq00aa	Just try standing in line down here in South Florida in the summer heat and humidity behind somebody who thinks deodorant is a capitalist concept and you will have your answer. Add to that, not taking a shower or washing their hair and you will have  one ripe banana.|`|N1UOHz58aa	The fuss is that people who don't wear it smell terrible and no one wants to smell stinkings do you? We wear it because we don't have a shower everywhere we go you know. Deodorant btw prevents smelly ness, BO, it doesn't prevent disease cancer or stuff like that. If deodorant gives u that bad of rashes though i advise you to go contact a doctor about that because youa re probably allergic to it but seriously do go you will be doing a big favor to the people around you and really do u want people running form you because you smell horrible.|`|yfGPE7Pwaa	it has nothing to do with that...its for other people, so they dont have to smell your STANK!!|`|fJPf8KCyaa	i dont know what type of deoderant you are using if it gives you boils but maybe you should get that checked by a doctor and yess if we dont wear it we can really smell bad,.
CCAQWT25aa	I see the person with the ID "Translator" couldn't take the heat, so he/she left the kitchen (read "deleted his/her post telling you to stop posting these texts here"). Some translator, huh?  I wonder if we'll ever see that name again or it will soon be changed.    I have both the knowledge and the skills to translate texts like this, and I can't imagine why a person who choose the name "Translator" does not and, even more, will complain about this text being posted here.   This is too much for you, "Translator"? Don't do it then, but assume that no one else can, because I can do it well; any translator would be able to do it. Don't say the text doesn't belong here. Perhaps your ID is a few sizes too big for you.    Maharet, you were left to your own devices. That happens often when you support cowards. "Translator" seems to have run away quietly when no one was looking, after having spewed his/her bitterness!

AA10541300	YB,      I'm not sure what you mean when you say:    'was put into care the day i started going out with him '.       You mean he went into a nursing home?  or you did? Got a day nurse?       Regardless, it's just a day.  If it doesn't apply, don't worry about it.  I haven't had a girlfriend in years.  I'd love to meet the right person for me, but that's not reality right now.      Think of it this way: if your parents are dead (mine are, is why it comes to mind), what do you do on father's day and mother's day?  If you live in Russia, would you celebrate Independence day (4th of july) ?  The answer is nope.    Valentine's day can suck somewhat because it's a reminder that you aren't tangled up in a relationship.  The thing to do is to keep busy.    Don't go somewhere with a bunch of couples making googoo eyes.  Don't sit in the dark contemplating life's disappointments either.      I'll probably get a pizza and a movie and light a fire in the fireplace, pour myself a big tall glass of cold beer, and settle in for a quiet night in the company of my 2 wonderful dogs.   I suggest you do the same, and forget about whatever it is going on with this 4 month thing.    Good luck and remember:  Even new Porsches sit on the showroom floor waiting for a buyer,  It doesn't mean they are crappy cars.    -Kevin

eeHrcxjEaa	I've been looking all over, and I haven't found anywhere that the "I Love You" gesture is offensive.  But the ok sign, and extending just the pointer finger and the pinky finger, is offensive some places.  In Argentina:    The "OK" sign:   The circular shape of the gesture gives it the meaning of anus, and is therefore used to call somebody an a**hole, or, by extension, a homosexual.    The "Hook 'Em Horns" sign (pinky and pointer finger out):  It means "your wife is cheating on you".  People use it a lot to "insult" the referee at sports games.      ------------------------  Other things/gestures not to do in Argentina:    Argentines tend to stand very close to each to each other. Many Americans, especially, and some Europeans, may find this annoying or rude. However, they will find it rude if you back away. So that is just another thing that you will have to get used to if you plan to live in their country.    If a person brushes the top of his hand from under the chin outward, he is saying "I don't know" or "I don't care."    If a person is standing with his hands on his hips, he is either angry or presenting a challenge.    Do not yawn in public. It is considered extremely rude.    Always pour wine with the right hand and never pour it by holding the neck of the bottle and rotating the hand backward so that the palm turns upwards.    If a person extends his arm towards you, with the palm facing down, and makes a scratching motion with his fingers, he is beckoning you.    The "thumbs up gesture is considered vulgar: it means "sit on it and swivel"....basically the same as "F*** you".    Hitting the palm of the left hand with the right fist means I dont believe what you are saying or Thats stupid.

Jehovah told them to become fruitful and fill the earth.     As for Adam and Eve's children, God was not fostering what is now known as incest by arranging matters so that the first children of Adam would marry one anotherbrothers marrying sisters? No. For, in Adams original perfect state his children would have been born in perfection. (Deut. 32:4) There would have been no family weaknesses to be passed on and accentuated by the marriage of near relatives, as is the case today, when the sinful human race has greatly deteriorated and many genetic defects exist. Even after Adam had sinned, his descendants lived as long as 969 years in the days before the Flood.    It took a long time for genetic defects to become so numerous and so grouped in family lines that it became dangerous to the offspring for close relatives to marry. Even Abraham, some 2,000 years after the creation of Adam, married his half sister. (Gen. 20:12) Not until God gave the Mosaic law (about 500 years later) did He prohibit close family marriage unions among the people of Israel.|`|8DRzJEfpaa	And were they MARRIED...?

That is the sin we are all absolved of, according to christianity, if we are devout and other things.

FGcwxZz0aa	The Bible does NOT say that Jesus was Baptised by immersion. The Bible is, in fact silent as to the method.    The usual meaning of Baptize (baptizmo in the Greek) is to wash in the Greek and not submerge or immerse. The modernist Annabaptists mistranslate the Greek meaning of Baptizmo. God bless!    In Christ  Fr. Joseph|`|IhIyQoF4aa	G908  baptisma  Thayer Definition:  immersion, submersion    Romans 6:4  We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Messiah was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.    Which begs the question how can you be buried in Baptism if you're just sprinkled?    Mark 1:9-10  In those days Yahshua came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opening and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.    -Came out of the water after being baptized.    Hebrews 9:19  For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,    This is the same blood that cannot save and doesn't refer to baptism.    Hebrew 10:4    For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.     Hebrews 12:24  and to Yahshua, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.    The sprinkled blood is the blood he shed on the ground when he died, nothing about baptism here.    there's a lot of references to washing us so we will be clean and washing our robes with his blood. Revelation 7:14    Baptism is not the cleaning these verses refer to, we're still sinners after we are baptized and have to be completely changed when we are made spirit.  1 Corinthians 15:53    Here's a reference which correlates baptism with immersion    1 Corinthians 10:1-2  I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,    They were sort of immersed even though they didn't get wet.    4truth|`|j1vjNjDiaa	The baptism/immersion that John the Baptist/Yochanan the Immerser  did was very Hebrew/Jewish and the person went down into the  Mikvah/immersion Bath & went completely under the water & was  cleansed. So now if Yeshua went down into the water, was immersed  & came up out of the water, what makes us think that we are more  important than Him & make up our own rules.  By the way the person going down into the water immerses themselves  and the person standing by, just makes sure you do not drown.  This is something you personally choose to do.  You can sprinkle all you like after a day in a muddy field, but you will  go to bed dirty & foul up the bedding.  If full immersion was good enough for my Savior then its good enough  for me.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	And I'll take on 1 Corinthians 10:1-2 with the whole of redemptive history versus passing through the Red Sea.  The Israelites passed through on dry land, at the most feeling some sprinkles of water around them while the Egyptian army drowned. Let's use another example of circumcision and the cutting off of a flap of skin -- versus those who did not believe, being cut off from God entirely.  Another example, Noah was spared with sprinkles of rain while the rest of the ungodly world perished. And Jesus took on the "full immersion" of crucifixion -- baptism by fire -- for us, while tongues of fire appeared over the disciples' heads at Pentecost.    Sprinkling fits with SAVING, while full immersion does not necessarily provide a match. And 1 Peter 3:21 thus properly describes this, putting "saved by baptism" in its proper context.|`|eXYldVRUaa	Well back full immersion is symbolic. The old you is the one being baptized.  When you are emerged in the water, its you becoming a new person.  Then when you come back up, you are a new person. Back then, they would baptize in a river, the current would wash away the old person and cleanse the new one.  But when my grandfather accepted Christ, he was bed ridden and couldn't walk. He wanted to be baptized, but physically couldn't, so our pastor came to our his house and poured water on him from a beautiful sea shell.|`|O3WYA3WGaa	Isn't baptism English for the Greek Baptizmo which means to SUBMERGE?|`|d94c5922ce90c815f0ead24d82e12632aa	There are many denominations who do not believe in full immersion baptism.  In fact, there are very few issues on which all denominations agree on.|`|r02L7oBnaa	You are absolutely right, sprinkling as a method of baptism is very much aligned with the idea of a covenant.  And if I can take ebed's answer and tear it apart, I'd like to take this opportunity to do so:    - Baptism does not have to be locked into a definition of immersion or submersion. There are other places in the Bible where wooden definitions of words just don't apply to the context.    - "buried with him in baptism" does not have to mean an imitation of a physical burial, which, by the way, would have been in a tomb located aboveground on a shelf -- which is not at all the same burial as we see today.    - coming out of the water after being baptized does not necessarily imply immersion.  The water could have only been ankle-deep.    - ebed is ignoring redemptive history in isolating the sprinkling of blood as being totally separate from baptism when there is a definite connection there.    - The one Corinthians 10:1-2 verse refers to a cloud -- what comes from a cloud but sprinkles?  Yet he tries to force an immersion out of this.  Go figure.    I absolutely agree with you, sprinkling is absolutely valid as a form of baptism -- although to his credit, ebed's immersion is just as valid.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	John baptized where there was much water.

You know how they like to pick and choose what they believe and not believe    In the Didache. Early writings of the Apostles before the Bible      Didache 7:1  But concerning baptism, thus shall ye baptize. Having first recited all these things, baptize in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit in living (running) water.    Didache 7:2  But if thou hast not living water, then baptize in other water; and if thou art not able in cold, then in warm.    Didache 7:3  But if thou hast neither, then pour water on the head thrice in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.    http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/didache.ht...|`|2CBxqNcaaa	Our preacher said it was a waste of warm water not to.|`|iQZpv42raa	Because they in disparate need to be paid for baptism|`|ATPPWOpWaa	I have mixed emotions about the subject.  First of all there isnt a "definitive" full immersion or a sprinkling baptism in the Bible.  Just assumptions.  BUT,  all baptisms were in rivers or bodies of water.   John the Baptist traveled to a particular area to baptize because "there was much water there".  This certainly begs the question.  Why would someone need 'much water' with sprinkling?|`|UI79JnJVaa	"ACTS Chapter Two, verse Thirty-eight."    "The Apostle Peter exposes the 'Keys    to the Kingdom of Heaven'."

6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	Of course.  I am a rational person, so all I am asking for is solid evidence of something before I accept it as true.  If God were to come down to Earth in five minutes, that would be some pretty solid evidence.  But you see, we don't get the kind of evidence you are suggesting.  We get the "well, you've just got to believe" argument, and the "personal experience of God" evidence, which, unfortunately, you can get from Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus, animists, etc., all of whom worship somewhat different gods.    If God were to come to Earth in the next five minutes, I would be the first one to admit I was wrong.  But I'm not going to hold my breath waiting for that kind of evidence . . .|`|LsJqpTWsaa	Ya.

GRANw6FWaa	Before telling your sister I would try a same-sex relationship without telling anyone. Keep it to yourself so your thoughts (if you're the type of person) won't change according to what your peers say. If the relationship turns out good for X amount of time and you really enjoy it- emotionally, physically - then tell your sister and see what she thinks.|`|fdMKpXCHaa	While I don't know your sister, I would say that most 13 year-olds will "let the cat out of the bag" rather quickly.  So, telling her may likely mean coming out to the whole family.  It will certainly change her perception of you, but not  only in a negative way.  Good luck.|`|Wo5Ezmwiaa	I don't see how who you are sexually attracted to is your 13 year old sister's business. I would suggest refraining from telling your sister or your family until you are actually in a relationship with another guy. Because really unless things get serious, they don't really need to know about who you are seeing, especially in the beginning. You just don't need to bother them with it. However, if you are just certain you are bisexual and feel you should share it with them, then I would go ahead. In this day and age, the young ones are more open to things like this. So your little sister should understand. Just reassure her that it does not change who you are or how you feel about her and your relationship, that it is just a part of who you are, and you wanted to share it with her because you love her so much and felt like she deserved to know since it is a part of you.   And let her know that in life it doesn't matter who you love, it's that you love.|`|oFSWpOjCaa	I think your best option is to pursue a same sex relationship, but keep it under wraps until you are fully comfortable with it. When I came out to my sister (who is also 13) she didn't want to talk to me for a long time. She's finally talking to me again, and hasn't mentioned it at all...but we're closer. She's much more willing now to share little dark secrets about herself to me than she was before.|`|YgKlTITVaa	i think you should do whatever feels right for you nd your situation. if you think it would be ok to tell your sister, then tell her, but remember, she's only 13, so she might not fully get it, she might not understand considering, as far as she knows, your straight.  Good luck hun! im sure it will all work out in the end! :D

I can give a dollar at the cash register when buying groceries to help the soup kitchens.     These are small things, but the can change things.     Since we are on a spiritual forum, we can pray for guidance to find more small ways to help. That is a really good way to work on a better tomorrow.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Yes, it will get worse.  What the bible prophesied is coming true more and more.  At the end there will be an earthquake that will rock the whole earth.  Things are getting worse.  I believe that will happen after the rapture occurs.  Comfort for the hurting?  There are not enough compassionate people to help all those who need help.  Many people don't give to anything although they claim to be Christians.  They don't tithe because they are not even in church, yet they think they are going to heaven but they live as selfishly as a non-believer.  It's the small percentage of Christians who are the givers and they give even though they don't have much to give, but they know the Lord will reward them.  There are many organizations helping those in disasters of many kinds but they need more givers helping them in order to make a bigger impact.

However, Jesus did more than teach his disciples to pray for the Kingdom of God. He made the Kingdom a principal subject of his preaching work. In fact, the Encyclop?dia Britannica says that God’s Kingdom “is generally considered to be the central theme of Jesus’ teaching.” When Christ’s followers pray for the Kingdom, for what are they actually praying? What can God’s Kingdom mean to them and to you? And how did Jesus view?it?<br>  Jesus’ View of the Kingdom--Jesus often called himself “the Son of?man.” (Matthew 10:23; 11:19; 16:28; 20:18,?28) This reminds us of the prophet?Daniel’s reference to “a son of man.” Concerning a future heavenly event, Daniel said: “I kept on beholding in the visions of the night, and, see there! with the clouds of the heavens someone like a son of man happened to be coming; and to the Ancient of Days he gained access, and they brought him up close even before that One. And to him there were given rulership and dignity and kingdom, that the peoples, national groups and languages should all serve even him.”—Daniel 7:13,?14.<br>  Speaking about the time when he would receive this rulership, Jesus told his apostles: “When the Son of man sits down upon his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also yourselves sit upon twelve thrones.” Jesus also said: “When the Son of man arrives in his glory, .?.?. all the nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate people one from another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. .?.?. These [unrighteous ones] will depart into everlasting cutting-off, but the righteous ones into everlasting life.”—Matthew 19:28; 25:31, 32,?46. These prophetic references to thrones and all the national groups indicate that the Kingdom is a government in which Jesus and some of his followers would be rulers over mankind. That government would have the power to cut off the unrighteous in death. Under Kingdom rule, however, those righteously disposed would receive God’s gift of eternal life. Clearly, then, the Kingdom of God is a divinely instituted heavenly government. The Kingdom is not the church, and the Scriptures do not allow for a secular view of it. Furthermore, a God-given government could not be something merely within a person’s heart. Since God’s Kingdom is a government, it does not become something in our heart when we embrace Christianity. But why do some think that the Kingdom is a condition involving the heart?<br>  The Kingdom Within Us?--Some feel that the Kingdom is in our heart because of the way Luke 17:21 has been rendered by certain Bible translators. According to the New International Version, Jesus there said: “The kingdom of God is within you.” In this regard The Interpreter’s Dictionary of the Bible states: “Although frequently cited as an example of Jesus’ ‘mysticism’ or ‘inwardness,’ this interpretation rests chiefly upon the old translation, ‘within you,’ .?.?. understood in the unfortunate modern sense of ‘you’ as singular;?the ‘you’ .?.?. is plural (Jesus is addressing the Pharisees—vs. 20) .?.?. The theory that the kingdom of God is an inner state of mind, or of personal salvation, runs counter to the context of this verse, and also to the whole N[ew] T[estament] presentation of the idea.” A footnote to Luke 17:21 in the New International Version shows that Jesus’ words could be rendered: “The kingdom of God is among you.” Other Bible translations read: “The kingdom of God is among you” or “is in the midst of you.” (The New English Bible; The Jerusalem Bible; Revised Standard Version) According to the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, Jesus said: “The kingdom of God is in your midst.” Jesus did not mean that the Kingdom was in the hearts of the proud Pharisees whom he was addressing. Rather, as the long-awaited Messiah and King-Designate, Jesus was in their very midst. But some time would pass before God’s Kingdom would come.<br>  When It Would Come--Certain followers of Jesus Christ have been chosen as his corulers in the heavenly Messianic Kingdom. Like Jesus, they die in faithfulness to God and are resurrected to spirit life in heaven. (1?Peter 3:18) Comparatively few in number, they will be 144,000 kings and priests bought from among mankind. (Revelation 14:1-4; 20:6) Jesus’ corulers include his faithful apostles.—Luke 12:32. Speaking to his followers on one occasion, Jesus promised: “There are some of those standing here that will not taste death at all until first they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.” (Matthew 16:28) Interestingly, the next verse indicates that Jesus’ promise was fulfilled just a few days later. He then took three of his disciples up into a mountain where he was transfigured before them, and they thus had a vision of him in Kingdom glory. (Matthew 17:1-9) But the Kingdom was not established at that|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	This is a bit of eastern metaphysics.  Check out Taosim (sometimes romanized as Daoism).  The Tao is everywhere.  You are part of the Tao, the Tao is part of you.  You cannot be without the Tao, and the Tao will always exist.|`|46zwfDpNaa	"And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:<br>  <br>   Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you." (Luke 17:20-21)<br>  <br>  The Greek word "entos", meaning "in the midst." <br>  <br>  It could not be said of a self-righteous, Christ rejecting Pharisee that the Kingdom of God, as to its spiritual content, was "within him." Our Lord's whole answer, designedly enigmatic to the Pharisees (compare Mt. 13:10-13), has a dispensational meaning. The Kingdom in its outward form, as covenanted to David (2 Samuel 7:16) and described by the prophets (e.g., Zech 12:8) had been rejected by the Jews, so that, during this present age, it would not come "with observaton" (literally, "outward show") but in the hearts of men (see Luke 19:11-12; Acts 1:6-8).<br>  <br>  Meantime, the Kingdom was actually "in the midst" of the Pharisees in the persons of the King and His disciples. Ultimately, the Kingdom of Heaven will come visibly to earth at our Lord's Second Coming.|`|83zdE9rTaa	Yes I do think that was the message. (Jesus' Beatitudes tend to validate your interpretation)  <br>  <br>  Prior to then the Pharisees and Sadducees were in a philosophical battle as to whether or not anyone would go to Heaven. The Sadducee(s) were "sad u see", cause they did not believe in Heaven. <br>  <br>  (I just want to warn you about something I only realized recently. Quoting red letters is not a sure way of quoting Jesus. Be careful, judge the validity of Jesus quotes by how they jibe with Jesus' public sermons (like the Beatitudes) cause there were many witnesses who memorized those sermons. 60 years after Jesus died, Paul followers and the early church could have easily plugged in Jesus quotes to support Paul's road to salvation and to help grow Paul's church. Another clue in regards to the Beatitudes: "Blessed" in those days (idiomatically) meant "set aside for Heaven" but the church hid that for many years. It is  difficult to Google, even if you use the Gospel's greek word for Blessed. -- sorry for rambling.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	As a Catholic I can say "BS'' to your nonsense.<br>  <br>  St Jerome disagrees with you and I go with him <br>  <br>  21 neque dicent: Ecce hic, aut ecce illic.

I believe Lot offered his daughters as a stall tactic, knowing that they would be rejected by the men.    As for the men's demands:  the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah (with the exception of Lot's family) practiced pagan rituals involving sex -- which was quite common amongst the pagans of that day.  In all likelihood, these men wanted the visitors for that purpose.  And I have read the Hebrew word used there (i.e. "to know") and have read Rabbinic commentaries on the subject.  The men truly did want to have sex with the visitors.    For example, medieval Jewish scholar Rashi wrote regarding Genesis 19:5:    "and let us be intimate with them" [means] homosexually, as in verse 8:  who were not intimate with a man. - [from Gen. Rabbah 55:5]|`|f0dbf7bef8f4954ab34a161d799935c6aa	There is an in depth answer to this on the page listed below. The article is called "Is Homosexuality a Sin?".

They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition.

It's not your fault that her friend saw the IMs. It's very crappy the way she is treating you and unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it, so your best bet is to move on, forget about her, and eventually you'll find someone that will treat you better.

zZxX5PXBaa	Naaman did. And Elisha said 'Go in peace'. It's one of the trickiets bits of the Old Testament to reconcile with traditional evangelical theology. Most people try to belittle some aspect of the text ... Naaman was a primitive person who thought that taking earth from Israel back to Syria with him would satisfy Yahweh .... that kind of crap. Naaman was no fool. He knew  he couldn't just resign from his job ... he would be killed. It was bow down to Rimmom with the king on his arm or else get the chop, and he chose to go back and live as a true believer in an unbelieving world. The passage is shot through with realism, not primitivism. If you get the chance, read Jacques Ellul's commentary on it in his book 'The Politics of God and the Politics of Man'. Ellul was a realist too.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	2Ki 5:17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the LORD.        2Ki 5:18 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, [that] when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.        2Ki 5:19 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.|`|K3PR7Mivaa	Naaman servent of  king of syria?
ehBPus3Zaa	The children of Israel were the actual people that built it, when they were slaves in Egypt to the Pharaoh.|`|AA12044219	Exodus 1 The children of Israel|`|ZFllYTlpaa	The earliest mention of city-building is that of Enoch, which was built by Cain (Gen. 4:17). After the confusion of tongues, the descendants of Nimrod founded several cities (10:10-12). Next, we have a record of the cities of the Canaanites, Sidon, Gaza, Sodom, etc. (10:12, 19; 11:3, 9; 36:31-39). The earliest description of a city is that of Sodom (19:1-22). Damascus is said to be the oldest existing city in the world. Before the time of Abraham there were cities in Egypt (Num. 13:22). The Israelites in Egypt were employed in building the "treasure cities" of Pithom and Raamses (Ex. 1:11); but it does not seem that they had any cities of their own in Goshen (Gen. 46:34; 47:1-11). In the kingdom of Og in Bashan there were sixty "great cities with walls," and twenty-three cities in Gilead partly rebuilt by the tribes on the east of Jordan (Num. 21:21, 32, 33, 35; 32:1-3, 34-42; Deut. 3:4, 5, 14; 1 Kings 4:13). On the west of Jordan were thirty-one "royal cities" (Josh. 12), besides many others spoken of in the history of Israel.
AA12044219	scorpions|`|ZFllYTlpaa	KEY VERSE: Thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it. Ezekiel 4:7    SELECTED SCRIPTURE: Ezekiel 4:1-13    AGAIN AND AGAIN God sent his prophets to warn the people of Israel. These messengers told them that they must turn from their sinful ways or face Gods judgment. Israel, although hearing the message, evidently did not believe that God would actually allow harm to befall the royal city of Jerusalem. Surely God will protect us, must have been their thought. Although God did desire to protect them and continue to lead them as his people, their continuing resistance to correction and increasing hardness of heart left God with no choice but to take decisive action. It was in keeping with Gods will that the Babylonians were now poised to attack both Israel and Judah, and along with this to destroy their great city.    Gods time clock was steadily ticking off the countdown to destruction. At this point, further prophetic warnings would be to no avail, but God did have a role for the prophet to play. Ezekiel was commanded to illustrate the fate of Jerusalem in pictures and symbolic actions. In verses 1-3, God tells Ezekiel to etch, or sculpt, on a damp mud brick a picture of Jerusalem under siege. This picture was also to include the encampments and equipment of the attacking army. The prophet was further told to take an iron panprobably a cooking griddleand to set it between him and this portrayal of the city under attack. He was instructed to set thy face against it (vs. 3), showing Gods part in the coming destruction.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Eze 10:20 This [is] the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they [were] the cherubims.

GuBF5xhDaa	First, if you are expecting to meet Dracula or the Cullens, find a new dream. They don't exist.    If you are talking about real vampires, then it is almost impossible to meet one in person. They prefer to keep out of the lime light (can you guess why?) Your best bet to meet one online is to try real vampire websites and forums. Do your research before you talk to them, so as not to sound stupid, and don't ask to be turned because it is not possible, and you will be laughed and insulted off the internet.    Feel free to email me for info and links.|`|0s190C7Zaa	How should I know. Good Luck!|`|dAK8dS4kaa	I know its wikipedia, but does a decent job of explaining the Vampire Human Subculture.

So if your hoping to be bitten and turn, your mistake. Though I can be of assistance. If it's to just make a friend, I would be honored. But if you want me to turn you, I'll just end up hurting you. Message me if you'd like. I don't mind.|`|ETmKEmX3aa	As one, I know how. Look for people who tend to stay out of the spotlight and keep to themselves.

Well, of course there's the cycle of water, earth, fire, and air    Starting with water:  The original waterbender was the moon, it's gravity pulls the tides up, and earths gravity pulls it down, for people, our chi (inner strength) will pull the water to our will. And the moon's coldness will sometimes freeze water into ice. Our chi can do the same.     For Earth, the original earthbenders were the badgermoles, but there are none. So you need to learn about Jing. There's positive jing, when attacking, and negative jing when retreating. And there's neutral jing, where you wait, and listen. I prefer the latter. Learn to use other senses besides sight. Feel vibrations on the Earth around you to know when people are coming, leaving, etc. And learn to perfect you hearing, and feeling senses. And the rest will follow through.    For Fire, The fire comes from energy, and breaths. Turn those into fire through your body starting with the stomach, to the shoulders, and out your hands, or mouth. And putting more energy into it will change the intensity, possibly changing the color.     And I haven't learned Air yet. But I will, someday. Someday soon. And when I do, I'll let you know.

Autographs are completely irrelevant.     Think about this. Here is what the Catholic Church says totally on its authority about the Vulgate translation. It has been 1600 years since that translation :    As Pope Pius XII stated in his 1943 encyclical letter Divino Afflante Spiritu, this means the Vulgate is "free from any error whatsoever in matters of faith and morals."    The perfection that matters is in the canonizing authority and NOT in the text !!!!!!!!!!!!!    If we had all the originals you'd still have the problem of the pericope about the woman taken in adultery, the 7 books of the Catholics and -- which you never mention but it is the most important point of all -- the interpretation. So you have it in St Matthew's own handwriting : This is my Body, This is my Blood -- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? PROD OR CATHOLIC INTERPRETATION.

d94c5922ce90c815f0ead24d82e12632aa	Atheism/theism is about disbelief/belief in God.    Gnosticism/agnosticism is about claims of knowledge/lack thereof regarding god's existence.    They are not antithetical positions.  One is about belief, the other is about knowledge.  So    - an agnostic atheist does not believe in god but doesn't claim that s/he has knowledge that god does not exist    - a gnostic atheist does not believe in god and claims to know that god does not exist, i.e., that his/her belief is true/factually valid    - an agnostic theist believes in god but doesn't claim that s/he has knowledge that god does exist    - a gnostic theist believes in god and claims to know that god exists, i.e., that his/her belief is factually valid|`|XxDQGEalaa	Yes.

Let's state a few similarities first: both created by deity(ies), both first women to bring forth life, and both made decisions that affected humankind.    Differences: depending which Greek mythos you care to accept, Pandora was not tempted by some 'devil', but rather she chose to open the jar knowing the 'evils' that would also cause growth in humankind and for people to strive.  Pandora was not punished as Eve.  Pandora died when she chose to open the jar, and brought back to life as a result of her choice.  Pandora was not ignorant as Eve was.  Pandora was not forbidden to open the jar, as Eve was forbidden to eat the fruit.      Pandora's first child was a girl (Pyrrha - Fire) whereas Eve had a boy.  Pandora went through the 'deluge' aka the great flood; Eve did not.    To repopulate the earth Pandora and Deukalion each cast stones over their shoulder. Those cast by Deukalion formed men, and those of Pyrrha women.
zKFSCCWOaa	It's not that black and white like you think. Natassia is right when she says that Quran says that men should not have more than one wife if he can't treat them equally. This is virtually impossible for any man-to treat four wives equally-so not many men should have four wives but of course rules are abused all the time. This is why you'll notice that most Muslim men only have one wife. <br>  <br>  It sounds unfair to you but in the pre-Islamic days, men were allowed to take as many women as they wanted while taking away their dowries and so forth and disposing of them whenever they wanted. Islam abolished this practice and the number of wives a man could take was now severely limited and made even having four wives basically impossible. <br>  <br>  Oh, and the reason women can't have four husbands? Do you seriously no of any man who would allow his wife to have another husband? Maybe a very, very small minority but we need to think realistically here. No man would allow such a thing. Even ask your dad, uncle, grandfather if they would allow it. <br>  <br>  Then there are more women than there are men in this world so this practice is a great mercy to those women unable to find a husband or who have lost a husband in war or something. I personally know of first wives who absolutely love having extra help around the house and with the children and other female companionship. These bonds between wives are very very strong.<br>  <br>  You have to read the history behind quran and compare before and after Islam before you come to conclusions because, like i said. it's not so black and white|`|AA12133859	cos the arabs were so warlike men were killed off and since women were supposed to be stuck in the house cleaning and caring for babies, this gave poor widows a chance out of poverty and rejection by society.<br>  <br>  The justification for a woman having just one husband is if she did the father could never be known which would complicate matter in a world where everything is handed down through the father and fathers basically own their offspring.|`|UhyvM73iaa	In most cultures women are higher in number than men. If widows or never married single women never find husband, what they can do. Do you suggest them to sleep around who ever they can find  like they call it one night stand?  If a man marrys a second wife and gives good life to both wives, is it not better than having illegal sex with women other than wife.<br>  Half the married men in west are having sexual relationship with other men  and women also do the same. How good is that? If a man marrys a second wife and becomes legal husband of two women, he is at least not comm itting illegal fornication. <br>  <br>  Wouldn't it be better if some one keeps his wife unable to have a child and marry another wife also with the persmission of first wife  to have an heir. Often men wish to have his heir. Why should he divorce a loving wife because she can not bear a child.  Many Muslim women pick a second wife for their husband so he is happy to have an heir. <br>  <br>  How all widows can support themselves and their children if  most men are killed in a war and there are no single men for widows and country does not have any social welfare system either.  Women not only need food, clothes and shelter, they also need legally married husbands who can satisfy their physical need also. <br>  <br>  Marrying a widow as a second wife and taking care of her children is honorable thing to do in Islam   I hear after world war II  lots of German women had to resort to prostitution  and married men took advantage of them by having sex without marrying them for giving them few bucks. Germany women had lots of bastards after war to surive themselves and their small children. Because men wouldn't marry them.  How good is the system  that doesn't allow to marry a widows besides his first wife?  I would say western women are extremely selfish. <br>  <br>  Even though Muslims are allowed to have more than one wife, Muslim men in most Muslim countries do not marry more than one. Very small percentage of Arab Muslims marry more than one.  Those men who have more money always wish to have more than one sex partner. President Kennedy and Clinton had extra marrital affairs with women. <br>  Lots of travelling salesmen practice sex with other women, Most high earning athletes have sex with other women. Lots of Catholics in South America have one legal wife but more than one illegal mistresses.  If they marry second and third wife atleast they will be legally responsible to take care of the children of extra wives and shall not have guilt of having sex secretly. <br>  <br>  Jesus never said to have only one wife  nor said that a man has to divorce his first wife to marry another woman. Why belief in Christianity for one wife only has caused so much<br>  corruption and illegal sexual activities in Christian world.  It is bad for the women with no protection nor rights for them and their illigitimate children without marriage.<br>  <br>  Islam doesn't recommend nor encourage to have more than one wife. One who marrys more than one wife  will have to face God if he doesn't  treat all his wives equally. That is must for man to provide every thing to all wives equally, or else he will be in serious trouble with God on the Day of Judgment.  Permission to marry more than one is for the protection of women.  In Islam God fearing men do not take advantage of  single unmarried women.<br>  <br>  In Christian world marriage is based on love before marriage. To find love lots of girls  end up sleeping with boys who never marry them.  They get pregnant and abortion. How painful it is what single women go through? Lov e of 55% such marriages wears out and divorces happen.  But in Muslim societies often love develops after marriage. Even if they do not love each other for first year or two, they are atleast legally married. They do start loving each other specially after they have a child.  Because Muslim believe to work out marriage and divorce is hated in Islam, most marriages do succeed with time.  And if it is possible for a couple, divorce is allowed in Islam. <br>  <br>  Think about all the points I have given you and decide which system is better for women between the two - Islamic and Christian marriages.|`|VDrNhLMPaa	This link answers your question.<br>  <a href="http://www.islamtomorrow.com/articles/marry_4_women_too.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamtomorrow.com/articles/ma...</a><br>  <br>  and check this one too :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080724040606AAt0eUr">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  if you are not muslim, please tell me to give you links of the Holy Quran verses.|`|tfkpNh89aa	By all means I am NOT defending islam/muslims and the 4 wives they can/allowed to marry - BUT - in all fairness...<br>  <br>  Joseph Smith / mormons and his/their new found "revelation of religion and the NEW covenant of the late 1800's - was married to multiple wives, BUT the wives were also able to have multiple husbands.<br>  <br>  Messed up!!!  <br>  <br>  And this sort of horse poopies goes on in America and God knows what other countries.<br>  <br>  The principle is the same of "polygamy" and although it's illegal here in the US and authorities are trying to crack down, it seems to be futile.<br>  <br>  So, polygamy is in mormons who claim to be Christians  _eye roll _ and also in islam....<br>  <br>  OY VEY!!!!!|`|zHNPTV67aa	@ natassia no the quran or should i say allah says in the quran that u will not b able to treat dem equally even if it was ur ardent desire meaning in reguards to hes heart and affection u no allah has contol over ur heart but bein just is ment by a mans time and wealth wot man has control over|`|IYQbl1bSaa	Well in the Qura'an it says that they can only marry that many women at once (4) to help them.<br>  Alot of people, obviously, abuse it.|`|N2MWHI4Oaa	Well, that was the usual in the VII century when mohamed dictated the koran. islams are still in the VII century|`|SaYZBTfqaa	well, Its not really like that...

X9rXRNUxaa	Pro 3:1-6  <br>  We are here taught to live a life of communion with God; and without controversy great is this mystery of godliness, and of great consequence to us, and, as is here shown, will be of unspeakable advantage.<br>  I. We must have a continual regard to God's precepts, Pro_3:1, Pro_3:2.<br>  1. We must, (1.) Fix God's law, and his commandments, as our rule, by which we will in every thing be ruled and to which we will yield obedience. (2.) We must acquaint ourselves with them; for we cannot be said to forget that which we never knew. (3.) We must remember them so that they may be ready to us whenever we have occasion to use them. (4.) Our wills and affections must be subject to them and must in every thing conform to them. Not only our heads, but our hearts, must keep God's commandments; in them, as in the ark of the testimony, both the tables of the law must be deposited.<br>  2. To encourage us to submit ourselves to all the restraints and injunctions of the divine law, we are assured (Pro_3:2) that it is the certain way to long life and prosperity. (1.) It is the way to be long-lived. God's commandments shall add to us length of days; to a good useful life on earth, they shall add an eternal life in heaven, length of days for ever and ever, Psa_21:4. God shall be our life and the length of our days, and that will be indeed long life, with an addition. But, because length of days may possibly become a burden and a trouble, it is promised, (2.) That it shall prove the way to be easy too, so that even the days of old age shall not be evil days, but days in which thou shalt have pleasure: Peace shall they be continually adding to thee. As grace increases, peace shall increase; and of the increase of Christ's government and peace, in the heart as well as in the world, there shall be no end. Great and growing peace have those that love the law.<br>  II. We must have a continual regard to God's promises, which go along with his precepts, and are to be received, and retained, with them (Pro_3:3): “Let not mercy and truth forsake thee, God's mercy in promising, and his truth in performing. Do not forfeit these, but live up to them, and preserve thy interest in them; do not forget these, but live upon them, and take the comfort of them. Bind them about thy neck, as the most graceful ornament.” It is the greatest honour we are capable of in this world to have an interest in the mercy and truth of God. “Write to them upon the table of thy heart, as dear to thee, thy portion, and most delightful entertainment; take a pleasure in applying them and thinking them over.” Or it may be meant of the mercy and truth which are our duty, piety and sincerity, charity towards men, fidelity towards God. Let these be fixed and commanding principles in thee. To encourage us to do this we are assured (Pro_3:4) that this is the way to recommend ourselves both to our Creator and fellow-creatures: So shalt thou find favour and good understanding. 1. A good man seeks the favour of God in the first place, is ambitious of the honour of being accepted of the Lord, and he shall find that favour, and with it a good understanding; God will make the best of him, and put a favourable construction upon what he says and does. He shall be owned as one of Wisdom's children, and shall have praise with God, as one having that good understanding which is ascribed to all those that do his commandments. 2. He wishes to have favour with men also (as Christ had, Luk_2:52), to be accepted of the multitude of his brethren (Est_10:3), and that he shall have; they shall understand him aright, and in his dealings with them he shall appear to be prudent, shall act intelligently and with discretion. He shall have good success (so some translate it), the common effect of good understanding.<br>  III. We must have a continual regard to God's providence, must own and depend upon it in all our affairs, both by faith and prayer. 1. By faith. We must repose an entire confidence in the wisdom, power, and goodness of God, assuring ourselves of the extent of his providence to all the creatures and all their actions. We must therefore trust in the Lord with all our hearts (Pro_3:5); we must believe that he is able to do what he will, wise to do what is best, and good, according to his promise, to do what is best for us, if we love him, and serve him. We must, with an entire submission and satisfaction, depend upon him to perform all things for us, and not lean to our own understanding, as if we could, by any forecast of our own, without God, help ourselves, and bring our affairs to a good issue. Those who know themselves cannot but find their own understanding to be a broken reed, which, if they lean to, will certainly fail them. In all our conduct we must be diffident of our own judgment, and confident of God's wisdom, power, and goodness, and therefore must follow Providence and not force it. That often proves best which was least our own doing. 2. By prayer (Pro_3:6): In all thy w|`|nx7QtF0paa	It means to not make God what you think He is based on what you want Him to be.

XN0cYCATaa	There are those who like to say that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality.  Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away.  The world wants to change God's words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires.  Nevertheless, the truth stands:  The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let's look at what it says.     Lev. 18:22, "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."     Lev. 20:13, "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them"     1 Cor. 6:9-10, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God."     Rom. 1:26-28, "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper."           Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation.     What should be the Christian's Response to the Homosexual?           Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again.         As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness|`|XmJZkFuMaa	There's a few answers actually.      There's the gay Christian who has the feelings but has chosen to be a eunuch rather than act on those feelings, never marrying, never having sex, etc.      There's the gay Christian who believes that homosexual behavior is no worse of a sin than lying, and so as long as you believe Christ has died for your sins then it's all good in the end.    There's the gay Christian who believes that the Bible speaks only against straight people being gay, or having gay sex in fertility rites, and believes things like David was gay and Jesus was gay.      For the record, I only agree with the first definition.    Add:  Here's a thought.  If someone believes that they are following Christ to the best of their ability, then they define themselves as a Christian.  Who are you to discount their beliefs?  You might not agree, but they are, by their definition, a Christian.  It's not your right to label them as a follower or not.  That's God's right.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	One cannot be Christian and live an actively gay lifestyle. Scripture is crystal clear on the subject.|`|uxfacsgmaa	It's easy.

It must take a whole lot of love for God and Jesus for a homosexual to remain in the same religion affiliation as the hate filled fundie bigots.      Do you think that Jesus is more proud of that ignorance, or the homosexuals love for him?        I am sure that Jesus has something special planned for the fundie bigots:    When Jesus Christ said that what you judge of others will be your sentence.  Matthew 7: 1Judge not, that ye be not judged. 2For with what judgment  ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it  shall be measured to you again.|`|1cGlucXyaa	You can't. When you become a Christian you leave your old life behind (how you chose to live it) to follow Jesus. Jesus would not want homosexuals with Him. I am not saying they can't get to heaven.

Someone put it this way to me, if you know that God is forgiving and wants you to love thy neighbor, then if you believe in what the Bible says about homosexuality then my friend wouldn't you be worshiping a false idol as God clearly wants you to love your neighbor regardless of who or what they choose to do with their life? I don't believe that God would want us to discriminate and hate. You also have to factor into the Bible that the early church changed many things in the Bible to fit their needs. When they took over the Roman empire, they needed to curb many things that they felt were not "Christian-like" i.e. the bathhouses where many people had sex with the same sex. So if you truly believe in that bullshit of homosexuality is wrong, then please, as Bob Dylan put it, "get out of the way, for the times they are a changing." (not directed at you, just in general at people who can't accept that the Bible is meant to be taken as it is, don't interpret for your own sake)|`|bZud91iuaa	Your being a Christian means you follow the teachings of someone called Jesus.  Jesus was a loving and kind man by all accounts, forgiving in all situations and willing to die for his beliefs as described in a book called the Bible.

Do you really believe that Heaven is a place to go to in 2009, and that God is this big guy in the sky keeping tabs on you?

If, however, the slave survives for a day or two, he is not to be punished, since the slave is his own property."  (Exodus 21:20-21 NAB)  So you can beat your slave to death as long as they don't die immediately.    "Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear.  Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ."  (Ephesians 6:5 NLT)  Infact, slaves aren't even allowed to rebel.

If a gay person chooses to follow the teachings of Jesus, whether it be in a Church environment or outside the Church environment, I believe that "God" is smiling down, giving unconditional love.  That is what we as parents, on this earth, if we love our children, would feel towards any child whether he/she be gay or straight.    Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

I do not for a moment believe that anything I write here will change your mind, however, unless you are willing to let God work through my words to move you to research Scripture more deeply than you have before.  That is entirely between you and God.  I also want to state that I do not know if I am right or not.  I can only explain how God has shown me to interpret His Word.    Let me briefly go over the so called "clobber" verses first.    Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve -- The story of creation is exactly that, the story of creation.  Where we came from, and how we began.  Any 6 grade Biology student can tell you that in order to produce offspring you need a male and a female.  This is how life is created, and subsequently populated.  The story, however, does condemn other types of relationships.  It says nothing about friendship, yet we know from the Bible that friendships are OK.  It says nothing about celibacy, but we also know from the Bible that celibacy is OK.  Since the story says nothing about homosexuality we cannot draw conclusions based on this story.    Sodom -- When you read the story, you will notice that God decided to destroy the cities BEFORE he sent the angels to Lot.  Also, the story says that every man, young and old, gathered outside Lot's house and demanded Lot present the "strangers" to them so they could "know" them.  It is generally agreed that the men wanted to rape the angels, and I will not dispute that.  But do you know why Lot had moved to Sodom in the first place?  To find husbands for his daughters.  If every man in the city was gay, why would he go there to find husbands?  Also, if you know anything about rape, it is not about sex.  It is about domination and humiliation.  Do you honestly believe that gang rapes that happen in prisons today are only done by homosexuals?  And why did Lot offer his daughters to the crowd if all the men were gay?  You also might want to turn to Judges and look at the story of Gibeah, and compare the similarities.    Leviticus -- Suffice to say that the two mentioned verses are part of the worship code, and not the moral code.  The worship code also says you should stone your disobediant children, and women who are not virgins on their wedding night, among other things.  If we no longer follow all these other laws, why do you want us to only follow these two?  Christ, himself, said He is the fulfillment of the law.    1 Corinthians & 1 Timothy -- There is much debate over the words Paul used that are currently being translated as "homosexual".  If you turn to the same passages in the King James Bible, you will see that they were translated differently.  The main problem is Paul used a word that appears nowhere else in any Ancient Text until some 200 years later, where it apparently means a heterosexual married man who keeps young boys for sex, a common practice in Ancient Greece and Rome.  If this is what Paul meant here, then it does not describe what we know of homosexuals living in monogamous relationships today.    Romans 1 -- This is probably one of the most problematic verses to interpret.  If you read the entire chapter, not just the verse about homosexuality, you will see the Paul states that these people KNEW God, but turned their backs on Him, so God gave up on them and that is why they sinned all sorts of things, some of which Paul lists.  It is not the other way around (ie. they were doing some of these things so God gave up on them).  They knew God, but were worshipping idols anyways.  This does not describe the gay Christians I know.  We know God, and worship and praise His name.  It is said that Satan will not praise Christ as his lord until the last day.  If gays are "possessed" by demons, then those of us who call ourselves Christians could not be praising God and His Son, and giving Glory to all that is His. Think about that.    I want to leave you with one other verse.  John 3:16-17 -- "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that WHOEVER believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.  For God did not send His Son to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him."  Christ does not condemn.  Whoever believes will be saved.  These are simple concepts, but some "christians" seem to forget them.    Peace be with you as you further your studies.|`|iorYnGrAaa	Read, "The God Box"
accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	I'm a little confused by your question, maybe it's the wording, or what are you really asking.  Why do lawyers lie and tell you that you can get disability when you can't, is that the question.  Especially as they don't make money if you lose, and they know you will lose.  Well, you never know what way the courts are going to rule they really are strange, is one answer.  But, I can say in NY it works one way, and I don''t know if it''s the same anywhere else.  Here it''s really very fair.  There are special lawyers who are basically only disability lawyers.  The charge upfront is $10, my lawyer didn''t even want the $10, and it was worked out that he made I believe it was set at $40 if I won.  To this day I still wonder why he set it at such a low winning rate as I had a case that couldn''t lose, but he had a wife who was a doctor and made the money in the family and he did this because he wanted to, and most of his clients were poor and didn't get big sums of money when they won, I was a rarity, but I didn''t fight it.  Most of the lawyers take about 10% of the winnings if you win, or they keep the $10.  Granted most end up with the $10, it''s not that often you get a client with an easy case to win.  As to why do they lie, most lawyers lie all the time, it's what they learn to do in law school.

It falls on a different date each year, because it is dependent on the date of Easter; it can occur as early as February 4 or as late as March 10.<br>  <br>  Ash Wednesday gets its name from the practice of placing ashes on the foreheads of the faithful as a sign of repentance. The ashes used are gathered after the Palm Crosses from the previous year's Palm Sunday are burned. In the liturgical practice of some churches, the ashes are mixed with the Oil of the Catechumens (one of the sacred oils used to anoint those about to be baptized), though some churches use ordinary oil. This paste is used by the priest who presides at the service to make the sign of the cross, first upon his own forehead and then on each of those present who kneel before him at the altar rail. As he does so, he recites the words: "Remember (O man) that you are dust, and to dust you shall return."|`|AA10034051	It should be important to all Christians, not just Catholic Christians.<br>  <br>  Lent, in the Christian Church is the forty-day-long liturgical season of fasting and prayer before Easter. The forty days represent the time Jesus spent in the desert, where according to the Bible he endured temptation by Satan.<br>  <br>  The purpose of Lent is the preparation of the believer—through prayer, penitence, almsgiving and self-denial—for the annual commemoration during Holy Week of the Death and Resurrection of Jesus, which recalls the events linked to the Passion of Christ and culminates in Easter, the celebration of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Is Lent biblical? Well lets see what the bible says<br>  <br>  our Lord observed Lent for 40days. <br>  <br>  Moses observed Lent for 40 days and received the commandments from LORD. (Exodus 34:28). <br>  <br>  Elisha observed lent for 40 days and taken to heaven. (1 Kings 19:8).. <br>  <br>  The people of Nineve observed lent for 3 days and were saved from the wrath of God. ( Jonah 3:6). <br>  <br>  Esther describes in chapter 4, that during the time of Ahasuerus, that all Jews observed lent for 3 days and were saved from the death. <br>  <br>  Prophet Daniel observed lent by praying and fasting for the Jewish people (Daniel 9:3-21) <br>  <br>  Ezra received blessing from God when she observed Lent. (Ezra 8:23) <br>  <br>  Nehemiah observed lent and received blessing from God (Nehemiah 1:4) <br>  <br>  “Proclaim a fast, call an assembly; Gather the elders, all who dwell in the land , Into the house of the LORD, your God and cry to the LORD. <br>  <br>  In all these versus our Patriarch’s and our LORD observed the Lent. Though the number of days varied, in all these cases, God favored and blessed the people who observed the Lent.<br>  <br>  <br>  She [Anna] never left the temple, but worshipped night and day with fasting and prayer” (Luke 2:37) <br>  <br>  Matthew 4th chapter describes our Lord’s observance of lent for 40days and His win over Satan. <br>  <br>  Our Lord commands how to observe Lent in Matthew 6:16 . “When you fast do not look gloomy like hypocrites……… But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you may not appear to be fasting, except to your Father who see what is hidden will repay you” <br>  <br>  Our Lord teaches that the church should observe Lent till He come back. “The days will come when the bridegroom is taken from them, and then they will fast” (Matthew 9:15) <br>  <br>  Acts 13:2 says that the Christians at Antioch has been fasting and worshiping the Lord. <br>  <br>  “The completing their fasting and prayer, they laid hands on them and sent them off” (Acts 13:3)|`|tfuPCVzOaa	I was brought up in a Methodist boarding school in the late 60's, in England (UK) and we didn't have that restriction.

Using that gift for your own carnal pleasure is considered a sin in God's eyes its like taking the gift and throwing it in his face. God created our bodies and knows that sex can be had for pleasure and he wants us to enjoy it but only with our husband/wife. Having sex before marriage causes the soul to be unclean and it causes God remove himself from you because he cant dwell in unclean places.

The early church just used that as a tactic to control people. There is no one place in the Bible or other scriptures that refer to sex before marriage is a sin.|`|9Dq2176oaa	The book Why Wait Till Marriage? points out another problem: Men and women who have been permissive sexually before marriage cannot be expected to change miraculously when they marry. With few exceptions, they continue to manage their sex impulses as they did before they married. The book concludes: If fidelity in marriage is important to?you, then recognize that it is tied in with fidelity before marriage. Remaining a virgin until marriage can help you develop the moral strength needed to obey the Bibles command: Let marriage be honorable among all, and the marriage bed be without defilement, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers.Hebrews 13:4.    An article in a respected medical journal thus concludes: It is clear that virgins have a better predicted chance for marital success because they often have other virtues, such as greater devotion to duty, more ability to delay gratification, increased concern for following the rules, and similar characteristics. Those who foolishly discard their virginity will thus have much to regret. Said one girl: I am 14 years old and have lost my virginity. With all my heart and soul, I deeply regret it. My heart aches because I wanted to be the virgin lady my future husband would desire.    Avoid Wronging Yourself    There is one final advantage to virginity that you should consider. The Bible shows that those who flout Gods laws are wronging themselves as a reward for wrongdoing. (2?Peter 2:13) How could premarital sex result in such a wronging of yourself? Consider, for example, an article in Seventeen magazine: AIDS researchers say they are becoming increasingly alarmed by what they see as a growing spread of the AIDS virus among teenagers. Yet, in spite of all the publicity surrounding this deadly disease, one study reveals that only about one-third [of youths surveyed] had altered their sexual behavior as a result of fear of the disease.    Such youths also fail to realize that immoral behavior may result in pregnancy, a score of sexually transmitted diseases in addition to AIDS, emotional trauma, a seared conscience, andworst of alla damaged relationship with God. Do not wrong yourself. Proverbs 14:16 says: The wise one fears and is turning away from badness. Do not be lulled into believing the myth of safe sex. As far as God is concerned, the only sex that is safe and acceptable is within the bond of marriage. Until then, treasure your virginity. Dont let others make you ashamed of it or persuade you to toss it away.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Your question is born of the flesh and not of the Spirit.

At least, it isn't according to the Bible.    In Exodus, chapter 20, we read the Ten Commandments, and are told that we should not commit adultery. Adultery however is not defined as simply having sex outside of marriage. It's defined as having sex with a married person. Nothing is said to prohibit sexual relations between two unmarried people. In fact, if we look in the book of Leviticus, we are given a list of every situation in which we should not have sex. We're not to have sex with married people, or with family members, or with animals. We are not, however, prohibited from having sex with an unmarried person who is not in our family.     Some places in the bible, such as Mark 7:21, state that "fornication" is a sin. Religious crazies like to interpret that as meaning "sex outside of marriage." It's not true.

65QqZBnjaa	My advice is to say nothing until you have to.  Too many employers, like other folks, are prejudice against us.  If you tell them up front you're almost guaranteed to be turned down.  Take the job, do it well, let them get to know you and then tell when necessary.    Also do your research and find out if you live in an area that has anti-discrimination laws that include us.  That doesn't mean everything is perfect, but it does increase the chances of getting a fair shake.|`|LOSfacl5aa	I depends on what state you live in. Here in CA we have protection against being fired if they find out. But in many other states there is no protection.  If you do not have the ID yet it is best to go in with your birth gender. Transition later when you can pass and you have the ID|`|HhPgZDDzaa	Go in a "don't ask don't tell" attitude. If your soon to be boss asks, then don't lie, but don't blatantly say "I am a trans gender" either. Under the Constitution, he can't fire you/not hire you simply because of that. If after you have a job and your changes become more evident, he feels the need to ask you what is going on, then go ahead and tell him. By then you would have established that you are a good worker, and he won't be inclined to let you go. Its not hiding if you tell the truth when someone asks, but remember: "Discretion is the better part of valor."|`|3OZgcntfaa	You've really got to look at this situation carefully.    Do you live somewhere that people can fire you for being trans? Like, most of America?    Are you able to 'pass' this early in your transition? Do you need to identify that you are in the process of transition? Will telling your possible employer this put being hired at risk?    Will the fact that you are working with children in this job make your situation awkward? Can you answer the question "are you a man or a woman?" without feeling offended by the little brat?    I have found it's appropriate to mention one's trans status after the contracts have been signed, before things like uniforms are issued, and in privacy away from your peer group (and in larger companies with a member of the HR department present).     Good luck with your interviews! Remember, they aren't hiring your gender identity, they are hiring you as a worker!

obaPQtJ9aa	Would you find it offensive to be called colorless?<br>  <br>  Colored (or coloured) was the 'polite' term for us before Civil Rights. When we finally achieved equal rights we rejected that term and chose to call ourselves Black. Why would anyone want to address us by a term we have rejected?|`|StRaKUf6aa	Sort of, but not really. It hearkens back to the times where there were "coloreds only" signs.<br>  <br>  I don't mind "People of Color" nearly as much, though.  Not quite sure why that is.

It's like imagine you accidentally touch someone's rear end in Sainsburys or something, you didn't mean it but they might turn around and slap you in the sorry face.|`|VMSZGnJaaa	Maybe it was the way it was used. If it seemed like they were about to use the N word instead then it'd be understandable to be offended. But other than that no it's not offensive. However, it just doesn't make sense, and a black guy I meant pointed this out: Why are they called "colored?" They're only one color throughout they're life, and that's black. But whites turn different colors at different times. Lol.|`|Rmbwvm2uaa	It doesn't matter what you call them, someone is going to be offended.<br>  Any term you can come up with, someone is going to take offence.

4WqvTAfmaa	Be very careful of your spine and the back of your head. That sounds like you may need to check your posture. The spine should be straight but not rigid. Many things happen in the back of your skull, little things like heart beat and breathing. Be careful. The chin should be tucked in a bit. This leaves the head tilted forward, so the skull raises up a bit off the top of the spine.    You need to read some information to get a handle on what you are doing. Better yet, get into a yoga or meditation class locally. Then you can check in with the instructor who should have experience and advise, and the ability to observe you.    Reading: I suggest several books, all of which relate to the different types of meditation that can touch on what you are experiencing.     Overall, sounds like you are getting a bit startled by actually getting results. If it is bothering you, then do a bit less meditating. Go out for a walk in the sunshine and fresh air.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	It sounds like you have a pretty advanced ability to 'lose yourself' in the meditation, possibly 'earned' in other lives. Go with it and see what happens.|`|nMK1qigyaa	you are doing it right you just get to the point that you are so relaxed that you no longer feel conected to your body.|`|zOX3bunMaa	This depends what you're trying to achieve through meditating.

TzY9vkinaa	Yes|`|AA10637643	Let me have the scriptures answer you...<br>  <br>  D&C 107<br>    53 Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing. <br>    54 And the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel. <br>  <br>  Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, near Wight’s Ferry, at a place called Spring Hill, Daviess County, Missouri, May 19, 1838. HC 3: 35. <br>  D&C 116<br>    1 Spring Hill is named by the Lord Adam-ondi-Ahman, because, said he, it is the place where Adam shall come to visit his people, or the Ancient of Days shall sit, as spoken of by Daniel the prophet. <br>  <br>  So we believe Adam-ondi-Ahman is in Missouri, not necessarily "the Garden of Eden"... but it had to be somewhere. <br>  <br>  According to Joseph Smith, Adam-ondi-Ahman is where God talked with Adam and the place where Adam offered up sacrifices to the Lord. At Adam-ondi-Ahman, Adam called his family together before he died so he could bless them (see D&C 107:53–56). <br>  <br>  Adam-ondi-Ahman will also be an important place in the future: near the time of Christ’s second coming, Adam will come again to Adam-ondi-Ahman and hold a great council. All the prophets who have held keys of priesthood authority upon the earth will come to this council to give a report of their work to Adam. Jesus Christ will then come to Adam-ondi-Ahman, and Adam will return the priesthood keys to him. Christ will then return to earth to begin the Millennium, the thousand years when Christ will live on and reign over the earth. <br>  <br>  This information about Adam-ondi-Ahman was very exciting to members of the Church. Joseph Smith said the area should be a gathering place for the Saints who were moving to Missouri from Kirtland. Many Saints moved to Adam-ondi-Ahman during the summer of 1838. They considered it a great blessing to live where Adam had lived. <br>  <br>  <br>  Native Americans the lost Jewish Tribes... maybe some of them.  <br>  Phrog gave a great answer.|`|xyIZv6iiaa	no.  but we do believe that Adam-ondi-Ahman probably was.<br>  <br>  The Garden of Eden was the paradisiacal location where Adam and Eve dwelt before the Fall - <br>  Adam-ondi-Ahman was a location in which Adam and Eve settled after their expulsion from the Garden.<br>  <br>  edit:  The LDS believe that there were three separate groups that traveled from the old world to the americas....not necessarily that american indians are jews.|`|YAoSgET5aa	ROFL, yes they actually do, and they believe "Satan" is "Jesus'" brother and they are all going to party like its 1999 when they die and are transported to some planet where "heaven" is. lol what a bunch of hooligans.|`|AGKOaVEkaa	Yes we do believe.|`|AA12383652	Yes<br>  <br>  Why is that any less plausible than it being anywhere else?<br>  <br>  If you are willing to believe that all humans sprang forth from 2 people about 6000 years ago then why would anyone that believes that criticize anyones ideas of where the garden might have been?<br>  <br>  If the Garden of Eden actually existed and the story is somewhat literal then you cant claim to apply any kind of archeological or scientific principles to the story to claim it was somewhere else and then ignore the scientific evidence that claims the story is very hard to believe, literally.|`|8jhACvtlaa	Looks like you got some pretty good answers about Eden already.  (in reference to the LDS answers)<br>  <br>  We believe that the Book of Mormon people were the principal ancestors of of the Native Americans.  The Book of Mormon people were made up of several different tribes from the Jerusalem area, principally the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh and Judah.|`|0T3weRh5aa	No native americans aren't jewish..I like how you twist it..<br>  <br>  We believe a group of people came from palestine to the new world around 600-586 bc...they were a small group, which branched out into two tribes of people.

AA12006309	Your sister isn't exactly transgendered.  From your description, she is intersex.  It's great that she is finally going through the surgery to make her feel "whole". <br>  <br>  I'm transgender, and I am biologically female.  I have my theories as to why I'm transgender, but I don't feel like sharing personal details.  Suffice it to say, my gender identity is third gender:  I don't identify as male or female.  I'm not a transsexual, and I'm not undergoing surgical transition.  I live a gender ambiguous lifestyle, and typically pass publicly as male.  My partner is a heterosexual man.  Confusing enough?  Good!<br>  <br>  I know my life is confusing.  Being transgender is a confusing thing.  You look in the mirror and everything you see is *WRONG*.  I've had nights where I just wanted to claw at my skin in the hopes of digging deep enough to find "me", whatever that may be.  I've felt like this since I was 5 years old.  I'm now 35.<br>  <br>  Life doesn't get easier.  Coping gets easier, but the problems stay the same.  Good luck to both you and your sister, and feel free to email me if you need to.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hermaphrodite is an outdated and sometimes offensive term.  The correct term is "intersexed".|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	Your sister is actually intersexed, meaning born as both genders.  If she was living as a male prior to transitioning to female I can see that she identifies as transgendered as well.  You must be so proud of her =)<br>  <br>  I am biologically female and medically transitioning to male, so I identify as a transgendered male.  If I was born with both sexes I don't know what I would since I'm not really in that position but I know for me I'm glad I am transitioning to male.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you've heard of the book Middlesex by Jeffery Eugenides but you should check it out.  It's about someone like your sister, who is intersexed and lives his life as a female for a while then transitions to male.  It is a fabulous book!

ixFbNr4taa	Cleopatra's father (the previous Pharoah) died in March 51 BC, and designated the 18-year-old Cleopatra and her brother/husband, the 12-year-old Ptolemy XIII joint monarchs.    September 28 48 BC Pompey the Great (of Rome) was murdered on the orders of Ptolemy now engaged in a civil war with his wife/sister.  He hoped to gain the favor of Julius Caesar instead - Caesar seized the Egyptian capital and imposed himself as arbiter between the rival claims of Ptolemy and Cleopatra.    On 47 BC Cleopatra gave birth to a child, Ptolemy Caesar (nicknamed "Caesarion" which means "little Caesar").     Caesar was assassinated on 15 March, 44 BC -- before or just after the assassination Cleopatra returned to Egypt.     In 42 BC, Mark Antony begins an affair with Cleopatra.   On 25 December 40 BC she gave birth to twins: Alexander Helios and Cleopatra Selene II.    Four years later in 37 BC, Antony renewed his relationship with Cleopatra, and from this point on Alexandria would be his home. He married Cleopatra according to the Egyptian rite (a letter quoted in Suetonius suggests this), although he was at the time married to Octavia Minor, sister of his fellow triumvir Octavian. He and Cleopatra had another child, Ptolemy Philadelphus.    At the Donations of Alexandria in late 34 BC, following Antony's conquest of Armenia, Cleopatra and Caesarion were crowned co-rulers of Egypt and Cyprus; Alexander Helios was crowned ruler of Armenia, Media, and Parthia; Cleopatra Selene II was crowned ruler of Cyrenaica and Libya; and Ptolemy Philadelphus was crowned ruler of Phoenicia, Syria, and Cilicia.     In 31 BC Antony's forces faced the Romans in the epic Naval Battle of  Actium. Cleopatra's forces sail away in the face of Mark Antony's losses.      Cleopatra committed suicide, the traditional date being 12 August 30 BC allegedly by means of an asp bite.

lu4lqwnPaa	The perfect one was about 3 years ago.   Nothing happened, and I wasn't reminded of Valentines day at all. It just went by like any normal day.     Aside from when I was a child, I never had a great Valentine's day. Even when I was a child actually in elementary school and preschool, it didn't go all too well either... someone always messed it up for me. In High School and College, the girls were just so stuck up with themselves, I didn't even bother to get something for them.     Now, well... I haven't found that special someone yet, and i'm still looking. One day, when I do, and the February day comes, Im sure thatll beat all the other Valentine's day overall.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Long before I was married, I was a waitress in a very old fashioned mens cigar, old boys type of place.  Anyways we always got gifts from the regulars someone gave all the girls European chocolates, another guy brought in wine an let us all have whatever bottles we wanted.  I had a 10 Valium I was saving for a special occasion.  This was it.  I left work, went home put wine bottle in bucket filled w/ ice ran hot bath w/ bubbles put the jazz station on, took Valium ate chocolates and drank wine.  Turned phone off and was best day and holiday ever, always remind my husband but I am still waiting on that Valium would be better than opening any box of jewelery.  I'm simple.|`|1ca70b7849e7eae97dddbd3fdbe9e22daa	my favorite v-day was last year because i bought the cutest nike v-day shoes a girl can have i mean for me it was the best because im sort of a sneaker freak so yea.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	Valentines day in 2006.

He got me flowers and ballons :)|`|y8wOnto7aa	mine was two years ago and i went to my best friends house she wasnt home yet i pulled up and saw a dozen of purple carnations and a box of chocolate infront of her front door and they were so beautiful and when my best friend came home i was like uhh where did these come from and she kept saying i have no idea ash i called every guy in my phone book and finally this guy (jeremy) said on his break from work he brought them by i just melted cause i love suprises and i didnt think he'd bring me them cause i pissed him off the day before now he is a douche bag haha

It is something he can hold onto forever.  LOL! Hope you get well soon! And hope you have a happy Valentine's Day!|`|N8Nq1HYdaa	i think its a cute idea...but it all depends on your relationship with him.   from how you described him..it seems you guys are close..the fact that he stuck with you  and took care of you with your accident and all..so it seems tHat all he wants for valentines..is to be with you..so i wouldnt worry too much if i were you :) good luck|`|cd87c1cf515692ef0adc60a28df772b0aa	I LOVE this idea. I like words, though, and also, underneath my EXTREMELY cynical self, I have to admit, there's prob. just a drop of an old romantic hanging on. So, yes, I love it. In fact, I'm envious that I cannot claim it as my own idea. My childhood dream was to be an author, so it might seem kind of fitting for me to do for a lover, but it would be even better if I could say I came up with it on my own like you did. You're very creative. :) I think it's a sweet idea.    If the guy had no romantic feelings for you whatsoever, and no feelings of friendship whatsoever, and didn't care anything about you besides the sex, then I'd say this gift wasn't appropriate, BUT if you two really have deep feelings for one another, chances are, he'll really appreciate the thought you put into it and will enjoy finding out what things remind you of him and of you all as a couple, and of your memories together. It's a really romantic, original gift, and I think it's fabulous. If he likes letters (esp. long letters), romantic gestures, or/and reading, then it's even more likely he like this. On top of the nice memories this will conjure, and sharing of feelings this will create, it also shows you really put a lot of time, effort, and thought into your gift, and if he cares about you, that should mean a LOT to him.     I got so caught up in the dictionary idea that I forgot to say that the picnic in front of the fireplace and the card are also nice. Wonderful, wonderful. I'd be EXTREMELY touched if anyone ever did this for me.    Oh, I have an extra suggestion, though. This is sweet enough as it is, BUT while this would prolong an already lengthy experience, IF you have enough room in the dictionary to do so, it might be nice if you could make short notes with SOME of the words. Not all of them necessarily. For example, if a word reminds you of him, but you don't think he'll know why, a short explanation or a hint maybe? Also, if a word has a really special memory attached to it, maybe you could make a short note next to it. I don't know if that would be a good or bad idea, actually, just something that occured to me, but I guess the best idea is just do what feels right to you. That's what will make it the best, and your idea is amazing, so apparently you don't need help in the idea dept. I hope he likes it. :) You sound like a GREAT girlfriend.
iWaU76T5aa	1. Redhead with Dark Red or Scarlet Red hair and pale skin clear of freckles would be my dream girl, basically a Euro Redhead lol, I do tend to find some Redheads attractive.<br>  <br>  2. Brunette = intelligent and overly analytical, the one to observes everything going on and tries to make up solutions and offer her opinion on things. Also a negative is that a brunette will start to mouth off too much and try to do what is "right" and if you disagree with her she may catch a fit.<br>  Blonde = Playful and always active, tend to be happy and tend to be kind. A negative is that Blond is often stereotyped as a gold digger hair color and a lot of blonds can be stuck up at times, but I know it is not true for all because my GF is a blond and she is a nice person =D.<br>  Redhead = Kinky and always ready to "do it", definitely the type of chicks I like. A negative is that redheads do tend to be too kinky and they do tend to break your heart at times.<br>  <br>  3. Redhead with dark red hair and clear pale skin, HAWT!|`|qWu5F1O2aa	I tend to go for brunettes a lot. Not intentionally but my brain registers that as hot.<br>  <br>  brunette (business woman lol dont know why), blond (surfer girl), redhead (freckles, side braids and dorothy from the wiz of oz lol ???)<br>  <br>  if they were all equally hot, the one who had a rocking personality. I'd take it  further and turn it into a relationship though|`|am3qzjrtaa	1. Redheads, I don't mean the light color like the almost orange is gross. But the darker redheads are gorgeous. <br>  2. I think redheads are exotic, brunettes are best for relationships and blondes just wanna have fun!<br>  3. If I could pick only one I would have to go with brunette. Blondes tend to give up on relationships and look just for some fun and redheads tend to be big heartbreakers. This is solely based on my personal experiences though. Brunettes seem to be more relaxed and easy to get along with. <br>  <br>  I am a blonde lesbian.|`|EZzCqUWKaa	someone who isn't pretentious and stuck up. Sorry but in my experience the media always does glorify blondes (blondes as in white people) and tries to put to shame everyone else. And most of the blondes I have known always thought they were better then everyone else so I like dark hair because most of the nice & sweet people I have met have had brown or black hair. :) I also have black hair and I love it! It's so exotic looking. haha|`|AA11691923	Brunettes.<br>  However, I hate when people talk about which hair colours are the sexiest, the are always talking about white women. When media saying blonde women are attractive all the time, they are secretly putting racist filth in our mind. Why not brunnettes? Any race/ethnic can be a brunnette, but we get fed blonde bullsh!t.|`|Bc4RNrfwaa	the first two answerers are stereotypical.
vV5QIlMVaa	AWWW !! poor you !! >    // theres nothing much u can do afterall, its like you're so hurt, even if he says sorry its not going to be okay! thats very immoral of him, to lead you on like that !! I;ve in a way been in the same situtation. But never those nasty pic. or like sex talk =X. ( though i wouldnt mind, hahah ) He lead me on, and i know he had feelings for me to. We never got to tell each others our feelings, and i know he thinks im a psycho, now !! O wells, i found someone else a lot better then his a$$. All you need to do is find someone else and you will feel all better and good. Find someone else that loves you as much as you love them. GOODLUCK !!

wX5HUjjYaa	yes thats good and a card, now if u buy a card make sure u write a lil somthin inside like a lil poem dont just give her the card plain lol.. or if ur on a budget make ur own they both means a ton. make sure its a surprise.. omg i feel so spoiled when i get suprised from my boyfriend.. go out n get a slice a pizza and/or a movie depends on ur budget and your age lol. but ur idea is good enough. the best part of it all is the thought u put in 2 it and hopefully she'll appreciate that =) goodluck happy vday!!|`|IHNll9Yjaa	idk ....just spending time with me is good enough for me........I like the roses idea....or you can take her out to a move and dinner.....the thing I'm really hoping for though, is a reallly slim chance.......him to propose.|`|Nl64RmRWaa	The 365 reasons why I love you is the perfect romantic gift for Valentine's Day. It's creative, original, and shows strong feelings.    You could buy her a rose dipped in gold. They are very beautiful.   http://www.theforeverrose.com/    Godiva chocolates are very nice. What's even better are their chocolate covered strawberries. Delicious and romantic!    Also, click the link below, and browse through the website. It has some nice gifts.  http://www.personalizationmall.com/Best-...    Whatever you decide, make sure to devote the entire day to her. Light the house with candles, get oils to give her a massage, have rose petals on the bed, maybe have a nice bubble bath for two. And don't forget a special card. Us women love those!|`|yGwda7wPaa	Your idea is good.  Depending on yur age, I would also suggest taking her somewhere special or doing something nice for her.|`|EhftIc1haa	hmm...well...i like the teddy bear and rose idea...i'd love if my boyfriend got me that.   spending the day with her also may be a good thing, girls really just like to be loved...so make it a special day! good luck! :)

But, I think it is just the Catholics that have made it into a sacrament.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Not even all Catholics do.  In the Eastern Catholic Churches,  LENT actually begins on the Sunday before ASH WEDNESDAY.  They get three less days of partying than the Romans do.  For them, the beginning of LENT is marked with a STRICT FAST day.  No meat or Dairy products are allowed.  Many of the old timers do not eat meat on all Wednesdays and Fridays of Lent.  Some still even observe the No Meat on Friday rule, but that is rare.|`|AA12194228	I was raised in the Episcopal church and we always had a service on Ash Wednesday and we did get the cross put on our forehead.

uky2nsh8aa	lol, that's an oxymoron, but sure i guess. more so as just lesbian that's not interested in sex. do u still want to kiss them?? some ppl just don't want sex. it's fine.|`|vg3ih0foaa	You are what you are, and you feel what you feel. I don't know if there's another word for asexual lesbian, but if you feel you have to have a label, I think that's one that would be a great conversation starter lol. I don't think you have to have sex to find out if you're asexual, it could be very well like lesbianism. You don't have to sleep with a woman to know you'll enjoy it. Lesbian can be sexual or emotionally romantic and the two usually go hand in hand. But if you have had only romantic attractions to girls, then go ahead and call yourself a lesbo if you want. If you're not romantically interested in girls, then I would just say you are just asexual.|`|5YaV9Sw5aa	Yeah, You can still like them, Its like me...I like a guy and kissing his would be fine but anal...Its a bit iffy
vg3ih0foaa	Until you get the hang of it and learn to eye out potential gay girls lol, I would suggest going to a gay friendly dance, bar or cafe if you have them in your region. If not, then try online. It's really easy and you can usually filter who gets to talk to you or not. Other than that, just take a deep breath and ask a girl out who interests you. The worst she can say is no, and at least that will give you some experience with the whole thing.|`|N2MWHI4Oaa	If you see her in bed with another girl, doing the nothing with nothing, then you might think that perhaps she could be a lesbian

7BHIyMFmaa	Asperger's seems to be all the rage these day. It seems that this affliction effects roughly 90% of the population. How can one be "selectively mute" either you can talk or you can't,. I'm not calling the OP personally, I just feel that there are too many labels being thrown around these days. People are different, it's natural. Having very slight differences doesn't constitute has necessarily having something wrong with you. 50 years ago we didn't have half the labels or medical terms we do today. Half of me wants to think that this a conspiracy by the drug companies to sell more pills. But then I realize that by even thinking such a thing, I would possibly be labeled as a schizophrenic and therefore would have to take even more pills and beg the government for help because clearly I'm entitled money just for being me.     I'vee been diagnosed with ADD, dyslexia, and Enclosing Spindlings, and based on what I'vee read I would probably qualify for Spurge's as well.  But I'lll be damned if would ever even consider asking the government for any type of assistance. Just man up and deal with it, life's not fair, you just have to play the cards you are dealt.      Edit: Compared to many, many "disabilities" Asperger's  is pretty tame. You simply can't compare it to other disabilities like SCIDS or ALS.  The point I'm trying to make here is that prior the 1950's people who had very mild autism or what would now be considered Asperger's syndrome managed to live without having to be told that there was something wrong with them. And now that we have names for these alleged conditions suddenly everyone and their brother has some sort of grievous plight.  The term "Man Up" wasn't meant to be sexist (although I can see where it would construed as such), it just simply means "stop complaining about your problems and do what needs to be done." The folks that grew up 50 years ago certainly had to deal with mild autism and Asperger's, but they didn't get any special treatment. I don't see why we need such things now. Back in middle/high school according to my IEP, I could've been given extra time to do tests and someone to take notes for me.  I never took advantage of that because in my mind there is nothing wrong with me. There are things that many people do better than me, and there are things I do better than alot of people. Like I stated in my previous post. Everyone is different. I do maintain that by handing out special accomodations to everyone who asks for them is just setting people up for failure. There are plenty of people who do honestly need them, but there are twice as many who don't truly need them, but rationalize that they do because some doctor told them they do.|`|wwdllMzYaa	yes YES its worth goign to college    you aspergers have amazing brains, and should use them  sadly, my boyf at 26 is still not doing that, and he coudl do anything he wanted to, (having a.s same as you)      you shodulnt care about the future, care only about now,and your life now, if you WANT to do soemthing at college then go do it    i wont lie to you, no it wont be easy to get hired, as of the moment, a.s is a hard issue to deal with , most people dont know it even exists and so just think your being an a******e, which of course we know your not, but, they dont    as an asperger, you must have amazing abilites, being able to communicate with other people isnt the only thing in this life, many aspergers are the reason we have the knowledge we do now in soceity and science      importantly  YOU can get a bit better   yes, its possible, you may know that people do and have gone up the autistic scale  meaning they have aspergers, but 'teach themselvs' how to be able to function better in soceity    my boyf has done it  and im very proud of him, and we did it together on our own, no docs nothing, jsut me and him  if we can do it, so can you            Additional    fodaddy    its things liek that that are the reason peopel dont even know or care about a.s yet  its not "pretty tame"  its a disability    all disabilites are just as bad for the person suffering them when it means their whole life is 'dis abled'  meaning, they do not function 'normally' liek an 'abled' person    i understand you dont seem to know much about it, but saying its not as bad as other problems isnt really helping anyone|`|K35Tuf1oaa	Hey, I have asperger's as well. And I would say yes, college is definately worth attending. You want to be educated don't you? I still have a lot of social problems such as having difficulty making friends and relating to others, as well as looking people in the eye when speaking, but I have been trying to work on these problems little by little. That's all you can do is to try to recognize what your shortcomings are and do what you can to make improvements and better yourself. Accomodations are available in colleges as well, so don't worry about that.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	Would you be going comfortable going to college online--  if you can find a locla college taht has both online and inperson classes-maybe you can try 1 class in perosn-and the rest online....  it really depends on what type of job you want--    there are careers with limited interaction with people|`|lz4nK3ibaa	I think college could be worth perusing, but again its not for everyone.     The college you're planning to attend probably has more things in place for people like you, and possibly even a group where you can go and be with people from a similar situation. The chances that they recognise Aspergers, and already have many things in place to aid your learning is higher at a college than at a school. College is a completely different ball game to school.     There are also a few Professors out there with Aspergers. My Special Education Prof has a favourite speaker who has Aspergers. You may even discover more lecturers and Professors out there that have Autistic tendencies.     If you think about it for someone to be so incredibly occupied and committed to a random field of study (eg. a particular species of moss!) Drawing parallels between some academics and people with ASD isn't always such a far stretch.     There is also the option of online study. There are many degrees you can complete on line these days. It's the perfect opportunity to get some great in depth knowledge regarding something you really care about.    As for what sort of job you should look into it really depends on what you like doing. what do you love to do?    Things with minimal talking or interaction with people probably sound more your thing, so what about IT, accounting, Artist, Graphic Artist, Gardener, Engineer, mechanic, cook... Academic the opportunities are endless.     I've attached some links that you may want to check out... but most importantly don't limit yourself!|`|AA10844779	If you manage to keep a structure in college and can get accommodation for certain things, it could work. Speaking as a person with mild high-functioning ASD, I can only give you my own experiences about it. I did OK in high school but once I went to college (I didn't know about the ASD at that point), I didn't have any accommodations and the lack of structure really did me in. I need structure but I don't have the discipline to keep it myself, and there was literally no control. Needless to say, I didn't even pass the first year, and then I started working.     Without a college degree, I haven't managed to find any permanent job. Depending on where you live there might be government grants (Belgium has those, for one, it's where I live) but most firms want a degree for almost anything. Thanks to those grants (if they exist in your area) it's possible to find a job if you're as qualified as a non-disabled applicant, so I would advise you to try college if you can get the necessary accommodations and find a course you like.    Good luck!|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	I agree that online college might be a good option for you, but make sure you still get out.  There are lots of careers that are great for higher functioning autistics.  I know some in laboratory sciences, pharmaceuticals, editors, librarians...there are lots of choices.  Think about what interests you.  Keep in mind the level of social interaction that you are comfortable with, and do your best!|`|ThZOfp81aa	I just try to tune out the ignorant.  They don't understand what it's like to have AS.    As far as college, I'm braving it myself.  It's tough, especially since I have trouble with almost willful forgetfulness(I'll forget about an assignment that doesn't interest me) and anxiety.  Work is tough, the longest I've held a job is 11 months.  It's hard to stay when you keep making silly mistakes and get fired for it.  But if you can find an accommodating job/career, you'll do fine.  I think maybe the world's starting to understand us more, hopefully in the future it'll be easier.    Best of luck!|`|kDHaeDciaa	I may have misunderstood your questions...are you still in high school? If so, have you looked into online school? Some states are now offering an online charter school (meaning it would be free, since it's supported by the state education system). One company I know of that is providing the school system for the schools is K12: http://www.k12.com/    For a great book about careers, I really like "Developing Talents: Careers for Individuals with Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism" by Temple Grandin and Kate Duffy . I am the author of a free Autism newsletter, and one of our past issues has a review of this book, as well as other resources for employment: http://www.positivelyautism.com/volume2i...    Another of our issues was about college for students with Autism: http://www.positivelyautism.com/volume3_...    Good luck with everything!    Nicole Caldwell, M.Ed.

3yn6zbbTaa	Kundalini is a subtle, feminine energy that resides in the sacrum bone at the base of the spinal column in three-and-a-half coils. In the same way that a power cord connects a lamp to the household current, the awakened Kundalini connects human awareness to the Paramachaitanya, the all-pervading power of divine Love.<br>  <br>  Kundalini can be thought of as a rope with thousands of strands. When we first get Self-realization, only one or two strands find their way through the chakras and reach the Sahasrara chakra at the top of the head. However, with daily meditation, gradually more strands of the Kundalini connect us to the divine Power and the experience of meditation becomes more profound and blissful. The Kundalini and the experience of its awakening, have been described by various Indian saints such as Adi Shankaracharya (ca.6000 A.D.), Kabir(ca.1500 A.D.) and Jnanadeva (ca.1200 A.D.).<br>  <br>   Kundalini resides in a dormant state in the sacrum bone at the base of the spine, and that when awakened it manifests as wind/breath. This can especially be felt like a cool breeze in the hands and above the head, though no material aspect like air displacement is observed.<br>  <br>  Whether it is called "Chi" by the Chinese, "Ki" by the Japanese, "Prana" by the Indian yogis, "Ruach" by the Hebrew prophets, "Ruh" by the Sufi saints, "Pneuma" by the Greeks, or "spiritus", the latin word from which the English word "spirit" is derived, it has the same meaning in all of these languages and diverse cultures: Breath of life.<br>  Source is the web below.|`|b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	You are Kundalini as everything is, if is wasn't for Kundalini nothing would exist, Kundalini "the energy of passion" is the universe.|`|IVy35SE2aa	What a great question and what a wealth of answers.This has<br>  been a rather arcane subject in this country.<br>  Swami Abhayananda told me that his teacher could bring you to Kundalini, but he had not acquired that skill.<br>  Edgar Cayce, "The sleeping prophet," who was himself a fundamental<br>  christian in early life, gave much information on Eastern thought <br>  systems from his trance state.  His son, Hugh Lynn, gave many lectures years later on kundalini and methods of safely opening<br>  to that energy source.  He was concerned that people would try<br>  to force the condition rather than invite it.  Hugh Lynn had worked with many people who had gone off the deep end and got into trouble<br>  mentally.  He always wanted to teach people to allow higher<br>  forces to manifest in their lives by living a disciplined and orderly<br>  spiritual/mental life style.|`|hegXnqYHaa	IhtiAndr has given such a clear answer......Just like to add that<br>  as she rises the Kundalini passes through seven subtle centres called chakras. These chakras correspond to the plexuses in our physical body, and to the stages in human evolution! On a personal level  they register any  problems which we may have.  After the  Kundalini is awakened,  we can feel each chakra upon a different finger or part of the hand and we can correct any imbalance in ourselves and in others!  We can also awaken the Kundalini in others.|`|cbf7a1df79c8809b6678b88d7a4f714baa	Kundali - Tamil<br>  <br>  Kundam - means round vessel container<br>  <br>  Ali - Means neither male nor female<br>  <br>  Kundali Vattam which is round in shape present both in the outer space and inner space.

It is not easy to understand the attributes of Kundali in the inner space.<br>  <br>  Therefore Siddhars wanted us to communicate with the Kundali in the outer space in order to get connected with the Kundali in the innerspace. <br>  <br>  Siddhar songs says<br>  Vatta Van Sudarae<br>  Vallaroli Vilakae<br>  Vayangu Sirtjothiyae. <br>   <br>  thus describing the qualities of Kundali.<br>  <br>  Pattinathar says<br>  Vettatha Sakkaram, Pesatha Manthiram<br>  VerOruvarukku Ettatha Putpam<br>  Kattatha Lingam<br>  <br>  Thus decribing the silent with great power of the Kundali.<br>  <br>  To awaken the Kundali, one have to fnd out the Kundali in the outer space. <br>  <br>  If somebody wants word to word translation of Tamil siddhars songs, please email me.|`|AA10422553	Kundala=circular-like ear-ring---ini=waterfilled tank(as in Hemaabjini(hemaabjam=lotus+ini=water tank--Hemaabjini=a water tank containing Lotus)<br>  <br>  In Hindu Yoga System there is a concept,that a lot of energy is stored in the fluid filled sacral well,in the form of wound serpent.(Kundalini Sakthi).During intense meditation,sitting in Padmaasanm,(Lotus Posture) pressing the toes in the Anal region(Balan Devaraayan describes this process),the thermal energy(kanal) can be raised=Urdhva Rethas--this energy serpent is said to travel ,starting from Moolaadhaaram through,Manipoorakam.Swaadhishtaanam, Visugdhi,Aangjna and Sahasraaram and unite with Bindu("Naadha,Bindu Kalaadhi").After the Union--{(Yuj>YOGA(m)},"Abhishekam" takes place and a lot of Vital energy flows from the centre of head through the entire BODY,giving the Individual Super-human powers.Some of the verses which explain the process are:-<br>  <br>  "mahii.n muulaadhaare kamapi maNipuure hutavahaM<br>  sthitaM svaadhiShThaane hR^idi marutamaakaashamupari .<br>  mano.api bhruumadhye sakalamapi bhitvaa kulapathaM<br>  sahasraare padme saha rahasi patyaa viharase ..

UAbrUMifaa	They've already tried with Esperanto, but getting everyone in the world to learn one language, with no previous history, culture or literature to back it up, coupled with the fact there are no native speakers, just means it wouldn't work. <br>  <br>  Besides, it was made to be as easy to learn as possible for everyone in the world. The thing is, it was based on a European style of syntax, which is completely different from Mandarin for example. It would therefore be harder for them to learn. And how would you decide whether to even use a Roman script, symbols, or a made up one?|`|ab12bf1cc4fcd2264e88fe8e2ee186f2aa	The world would be less interesting, if there were only one universal tongue.

0IKdojzeaa	I think you mean humans. The entire world is not close minded. Those like me are the victims of your (not you specifically) endless blood rage. You want to be on the top of the food chain so you kill my kind and show off our pelts to the world.     I wish humans would finally see the error of their ways, but it's nearly impossible. I guarantee you there are a fair amount of them laughing at me right now just for what I'm saying. Are beings like me so hard to believe? I want to save you, but I can't do anything if you continue to kill my family for no reason.     You will either have to face the truth or die out. It may sound harsh, but it is true. You can finally realize that you are not the masters of the universe and that you are not the masters of the Wolves, or you can die in your stubborn ways.

I expect in the UK ect. there will be men who treat women like crap because they think they are better and vice versa (but more men sexist to women I would say). In countries like Afghanistan, men OWN their wives, it's ok to beat them and they can't go to school ect. since the Taliban started there or at least it was, i'm not sure if the war is getting the Taliban out (making the laws like this) and changing things for women again.

BIisYZ7raa	Fundraising.. you could do a classic bake sale, haven't done those in a while. For something original.. Karaoke is fun. You could ask the students for what songs. Some of the songs could be for the whole school to sing (free) and if you wanna choose a song for you or a group of people cost 50 cents. The school songs would be the school anthem and songs like 'On top of spaghetti' while the other songs are chosen by the school (ask teachers to make a poll, they can ask the students what are their favourite songs and then the class can vote on it) and then the student council can choose which songs are appropriate. If you need a spirit day, it could be everyone dresses up like someone else other than themselves.    The chocolate rose. It's more romantic (I mean, Valentines day themed) and lolipops seem cheap. But if the students don't want it to be so lovey, you could just do both, half of each, and the students could choose. You could even include some ribbon tied to the lolipop sticks to make it look better.|`|kc3qTsjaaa	For our yr 12 fundraiser we sold heart shaped helium baloons to students and we delivered them to the person they bought it for.

V8Lyc2Jlaa	Both doctor and lawyer, heh? Why don't you opt for President of the USA while you're at it?  OK, that was just to say something insulting or stupid, now let's get serious.  In almost any line of work, you make money if you're good at it, and you live on unemployment if you're not. This means that your first concern shouldn't be "which job makes the most money" but "what am I really good at?". I can tell you for sure that doctors and lawyers are two very different professions, one involving a more practical approach (you do things with your hands), and the other being of a more abstract nature (you do things with your mouth).  Since you're still in 8th grade, I'd suggest you started working on which school subjects you're good at (if you try), or which ones you find more interesting (once again, if you try). Then come back and ask what you can do that involves history/chemistry/litterature/whatever and that has good money for those in it, and we'll sort it out.

It won't be easy, but your closest friends should understand; otherwise they're not worth your time. I would also begin dating. When someone from your office does figure out that your gay, word will spread; however, do not expect the one gay guy in your office to help bring you out of the closet. It's not his responsibility to help you in any way. If he does help, great! But it's still not his obligation as a fellow gay person.
aBHY2iXraa	It always hurts - a lifetime spent believing a lie! It's tragic.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Actually, that man was stupid.    What if the god that really exists sends all good people to heaven and all bad people to hell except people who pretended to know for a fact another god existed? then all good atheists are going to heaven but YOU ARE GOING STRAIGHT TO HELL. Why not repent when you still have time? Why risk eternity in hell?    What if god loves music and sends all musicians to heaven, but all other people to hell? How can you risk eternal torture by not playing at least four hours a day?    And how can you worship a sadistic god that tortures good people - most of the people who ever lived - for all eternity?    Pascal's wager:    "If god exists, it's infinitely better to believe, since you get heaven instead of hell for eternity. If he doesn't, it doesn't matter since you're dead anyway. So overall it's better to believe"    This is, of course, false.    Some of the problems with the argument:    * The assumption that if a god really exists, he or she set up an afterlife with a heaven and hell    * The assumption that if a god really exists, he or she cares about belief in him/her above all else    * The assumption that if you believe in a god, it will definitely be the same god that actually exists.    * The assumption that you lose nothing if it's false. Religious belief costs people plenty - money donated to churches, time spent praying, marriages ending because of religious differences, lives lost because of relying on prayers or refused medical care, wars... need I go on?    * The assumption that people can believe in something simply because it benefits them. Would you believe goblins exist for twenty bucks? Why not?    * The assumption that any god won't see through the "believing just to get into heaven" ploy.    http://www.abarnett.demon.co.uk/atheism/...  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal...  http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/t...|`|eBKJRmEgaa	There are so many reasons why that statement is NOT wise.

No, he was NOT a wise guy.    1. Even if I were to pick a god to believe in, why would YOUR god be more likely to exist than any other one? There are thousands of different deities out there, and I would probably fail. As a matter of fact, YOU would too! Say, what if we're both wrong, and there is a god, but that god is Zeus, not Yahweh? I bet he would not be happy with either of us, and maybe we would both end up burning in the same place for all eternity..    2. How do you know that this god would appreciate forced belief in him more than he would appreciate reasoning and inquiry, and me using the very brain that he supposedly gave me? Maybe the conclusion in and on itself wouldn't matter, just that I was intellectually honest and tried figuring out the truth. Besides, if I decided to believe out of fear, (which I cannot, because I don't fear anything), wouldn't he be able to see through that..?    3. I cannot believe. Not anymore. It's just not possible.  I'm an atheist, not for emotional reasons, but for rational ones.    So I'll be stuck with atheism, unless suddenly evidence for a god's existence is discovered, or the supposed god in question actually chooses to show himself to us. I could go to church, get down on my knees and pray, fake it pretty damn well.. But I would never truly believe. Not deep down. Not when it comes to it. And your god, being omniscient and omnipotent, would know that, if he existed.    See..? This is why Pascal's Wager fails.  Don't do it again.|`|SygvUa0Eaa	Oh yes, I truly see the intelligence in that quote... (Sarcasm).    Why not? Because what if he doesn't exist? What if it's Buddha? Zeus? You have to think. You could substitute the word 'God' with any type of religious symbol from various beliefs. Ex.:    Christians, a wise man once said, " A non believer is fine not believing in Eos if He doesn't exist. But if He does, then they are in trouble"  Why not? It never hurts.    Obviously, I twisted it around some. Do you see logic in this? If I were to substitute any of those words for some other god, would you think it wise? No?|`|231296b9ebdeed24570b8ca6978948c0aa	Pascal's Wager!    Drink.    And if you believe in God, and live a good, moral lifestyle, and then he doesn't exist; well, what a waste.

AA10556726	Probably the most important thing you should learn from this is that most, if not all, holy sites in the holy land where various events supposedly happened, are the product of a noble lady riding around and asking people where something happened or just declaring where something happened.  Granted, she *might* have been lucky and gotten a few right or the local legends might have been right.  However, if you visit the holy land, you should be skeptical of any sites you visit unless there is solid archeological evidence presented.    The second thing you should know, is that the wise men (no number of them given, we just know that they gave at least 3 gifts), probably showed up as much as two years later.  Based on their travels, Herod had all male children under the age of two put to death.    The third thing that you should learn is that there is no compelling evidence for Jesus existing, and given that the rest of the Bible is not anywhere close to real history, you should not regard it as real.|`|LEAx00NEaa	He was born in a manger|`|iHDYncuXaa	Luke 2:7  and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

mLYFbStGaa	Yes, God CAN heal an amputated leg.  The question is WILL he?  The answer is probably NO.  Christ said very few people had faith, REAL faith in this world.  If they did, they could move mountains.      Also, few people ask with His purposes in mind.  If you ask for your leg to be healed so you can have an easier life, you are self-motivated.  If you, to your deepest core, want to use it to serve God only, then perhaps He would listen.  But normally God uses these things in our lives to teach us lessons, witness to others, and achieve His purposes, knowing that in heaven your leg will be fully restored for an eternity, versus the 50 years here on earth you are without it.    Mat 17:15  "Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.   Mat 17:16  So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him."   Mat 17:17  Then Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me."   Mat 17:18  And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.   Mat 17:19  Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, "Why could we not cast it out?"   Mat 17:20  So Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.    If these men who witnessed first hand Jesus' miracles didn't have faith, what about us who have NOT seen, and are living in a world bent on discreditting everything God says?|`|O3WYA3WGaa	He will in the resurrection.     It certainly is possible. A doctor could do it if the conditions were right.  But, God created people in such a way that our fallen off limbs won't grow back. It's highly unlikely God would make a limb grow back unless it served a purpose in the whole scheme of things, like when Jesus did all those miracles.|`|wH5iLnqjaa	The following is my opinion on the matter, feel free to disagree    First of all, it's good to question.  If god did not want us to question him, then he wouldn't have given us intelligence.    I'm 17 years old and have questioned a lot about god these past couple of years and through my questions, I have gained a deeper understanding of god and the universe he created.    As for his questions... When I was questioning about god to my church members, they would often use bible verses to answer my questions.  These answers, though authoritative, have often left me disappointed for a more personal touch.  Also, I would often get vague and unclear replies like "go pray to god about it and ask for the answer"  These answers are also not satisfying.    I think the best approach would be to first state your own opinions, even if you're not sure.  If your not sure about something, tell him so and state your own reasoning of why you think one way or another.      As for the amputated leg, I think god can cure it.  After all, god is above logic.|`|DvpQ5jXUaa	i believe God can do anything    but that doesnt mean that he WILL do anything    i believe that everything happens for a reason    yes, horrible things happen and its so easy to throw our hands up in the air and cry 'Why God, WHY????'    but i think that God wants us to learn from all our experiences    a remarkable person that came to mind wen i read your question is Bethany Hamilton. she was a younf girl attacked by a shark in Hawaii    she lost an arm    but this has empowered her and strengthened her faith    she is an insiration to thousands of people    she was a top surfer before her accident, and even though now she only has one arm, she still competes    bad experiences will throw us down, but they teach us how to be strong and to get back up again    God wants us to trust him. when we do, things do get better    maybe you could tell him this story    **************************************...  a man went to the barber. as the barber was cutting his hair, he said to the man 'do you believe in God?'    the man said 'well, yes i do'    the barber then said ' well, i dont! i look oustiside every day and see hungry people, anger, violence. i see homeless people out on the street and i think to myself..if there was a God, we would stop all this!'    not wanting to argue with the barber as his hair was being cut, the man stayed silent    as he left the barber shop, the man saw a homeless guy out on the street    he returned to the barber and said    'i dont believe barbers exist'    the barber was stunned 'what do you mean? of course they exist!'    the man replied ' i just saw a man outside with long hair and a long tangled beard. if barbers existed, he would have his hair cut!'    **************************************...    its normal for teens to doubt their faith now and again  i doubted when one of my teachers developed cancer, and then died    it took me while to realise that God does love me, as He loves everyone.if Jesus died for us, then He really must love us    so i guess you could answer your Son and tell him that nothing is impossible for God, but life is not meant to be perfect. bad experences will make us stronger. God is not there to wave a magic wand and fix all our problems.    just like parents.....they can teach us, but cant shelter us from everything. children)need to find their own way in life and learn for themselves    i hope that i have helped you    God bless    :-)|`|GBjMqElBaa	He is questioning, and though it is difficult, it IS a good thing. Now you have to have some good answers for him.   For one thing, God can heal through the use of doctors...etc.    We know that in his earthly ministry Jesus did many miracles. He raised the dead. HE RAISED from the dead. etc.  Something I very delicately point out to people sometimes, is that God heals everybody. HUH??? Yes, at least everybody that is in Christ. Some he heals while we are on earth. Others, he heals by taking them home where:   Revelation 21:4 (King James Version)     4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.    Death is seen as the very worst of things that can happen from our earthly perspective, but it is simply going through a doorway into a perfect world prepared by our Savior. Could God do those things mentioned? YES! But sometimes he does them by taking the person to be with Him.  There is a website that tells of many modern day miracles that have happen. It is at http://bibleprobe.com/  under Topics look for "Real Miracles".  I would also recommend that you look at some books on apologetics. A favorite of mine is "I Don'T Have Enough Faith To Be an Atheist" by Norman L. Geisler and Frank Turek. They give solid and sound reasons for the Christian faith. If you prefer something shorter look at "Prepared To Answer: A Christian's Guide To Today's Spiritual Questions" available at www.lulu.com (Just put in the title).|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Tell him that God IS God and He can do anything. If He decides for some reason not to cure someone then it is Him alone that knows why He doesn't. He sees the future and knows what is best for us, even though we may not think so.|`|AA11232725	Yes, God can cure an amputated leg.     Probably the next question will start with "Why" as in Well if God can...then why...    The answer is that we live in a fallen creation corrupted by sin. God will cure every disease and every amputee when we who are faithful in Christ join Him in the new Heavens and earth to come.    Revelation 21:1  Now I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. Also there was no more sea.  2  Then I, John, saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.      3  And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people. God Himself will be with them and be their God.  4  And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away."  5  Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And He said to me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."      6  And He said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely to him who thirsts.  7  He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son.  8  But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."    Jesus and the apostles performed miraculous healings as did some of the Old Testament prophets. God performs miracles for a specific reason like to confirm that Jesus is God's Son or to confirm that people were speaking in the name of God.    While God can still do miracles and there are scattered testimonies that come in from time to time, especially in third world countries were there is no established church, miracles are by definition something that doesn't happen all the time. When you look through the Bible the miracles seem to clump together during different periods of time when God was doing something that He wanted to confirm was divine in nature. If you consider that the Bible covers about 6,000 years of time, when you add up the miracles you see that there were long periods of time without any miracles being recorded.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Tell him that God will perfectly restore all His Christians in heaven one day.

MOST would agree that the birth of a child can be one of lifes most joyful events. When I first gazed at my newborn daughter, it was a wonderful feeling, says a mother named Aleah. I thought she was the most beautiful child I had ever seen. Such a joyful occasion, though, can also create anxiety for parents. My concern, says Aleahs husband, was whether I could properly prepare my daughter for the trials of life. Many parents share such concerns and realize the need for training their children with love. However, Christian parents who desire to give such loving training face challenges. What are some of them?     We are now living deep in the last days of this system. As foretold, a loveless attitude pervades society. Even among family members, people display no natural affection and have become unthankful, disloyal, .?.?. without self-control, fierce. (2?Timothy 3:1-5) Daily contact with people who display such traits can affect the way members of Christian families treat one another. In addition, parents wrestle with their own inherited tendency to lose self-control, to say things they do not mean, and to use poor judgment in other ways.Romans 3:23; James 3:2, 8,?9.     Despite these challenges, parents can raise happy, spiritually healthy children. How? By following the Bibles advice: Let all your affairs take place with love. (1?Corinthians 16:14) Indeed, love is a perfect bond of union. (Colossians 3:14) Let us examine three aspects of love described by the apostle Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians and discuss some specific ways parents can put this quality to work as they train their children.1?Corinthians 13:4-8.    The Need to Be Long-Suffering     Paul wrote: Love is long-suffering. (1?Corinthians 13:4) The Greek expression translated long-suffering denotes patience and slowness to anger. Why do parents need to be long-suffering? Most parents can no doubt think of many reasons. Consider just a few. Children seldom ask just once for some desired object. Even if a parent replies with a firm no, the child may ask again and again, hoping for a different answer. Teenagers may want to argue at length that they should be allowed to take some course of action that the parent knows to be foolish. (Proverbs 22:15) And like all of us, children are prone to repeat some of their mistakes.Psalm 130:3.     What can help parents to be long-suffering and patient with their children? King Solomon wrote: The insight of a man certainly slows down his anger. (Proverbs 19:11) Parents gain insight into their childrens behavior by recalling that at one time they too used to speak as a babe, to think as a babe, to reason as a babe. (1?Corinthians 13:11) Parents, can you remember bothering your mother or father to give in to a childish request? As a teenager, did you ever think that your parents just did not understand your feelings or problems? If so, you likely appreciate why your children behave as they do and why they need constant, patient reminders of your decisions. (Colossians 4:6) It is worth noting that Jehovah told Israelite parents to inculcate his laws in their young ones. (Deuteronomy 6:6,?7) The Hebrew word for inculcate means to repeat, to say again and again, to impress. This implies that parents may have to repeat themselves many times before a child learns to apply Gods laws. Similar repetition is often needed to teach other lessons in life.     A long-suffering parent, however, is not a permissive parent. Gods Word warns: A boy let on the loose will be causing his mother shame. To prevent such an outcome, the same proverb states: The rod and reproof are what give wisdom. (Proverbs 29:15) At times, children may question the right of parents to reprove them. But Christian families should not be run as a democracy, as if the parents right to enforce rules were somehow dependent on the childrens approval. Rather, Jehovah, as the ultimate Head of the family, confers on parents the authority to train and discipline their children lovingly. (1?Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 3:15; 6:1-4) In fact, discipline is closely linked with the next aspect of love mentioned by Paul.    How to Discipline in Love     Paul wrote that love is .?.?. kind. (1?Corinthians 13:4) Parents who are truly kind will discipline their children in a consistent manner. By doing so, they imitate Jehovah. Whom Jehovah loves he disciplines, wrote Paul. Please note that the type of discipline referred to in the Bible does not simply mean punishment. It carries the idea of training and education. What is the purpose of such discipline? To those who have been trained by it, Paul states, it yields peaceable fruit, namely, righteousness. (Hebrews 12:6,?11) When parents kindly educate their children according to Gods will, they give them the opportunity to become peaceable, upri|`|GBKaftrJaa	It's very healthy for kids that age to ask very serious questions. It's important to realize they are just questions and not to over react.  Like when my 16 year old niece (who's now 31) told me she thought she'd be an atheist, I just said, well, that's good to consider all your options - as I was walking her into church, ha ha.    So, yes, of course, God can make any body whole again.  God can do it all.  There are books on the subject of why does God allow bad things to happen you could read for more in depth answers.

Give Texas Doll the 10pts.|`|VRl1jENHaa	I would tell him that, although Jesus has given many of us the gift of healing, there are some healing miracles that are reserved for Him only.  Examples include the healing of leprosy; restoring sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf; restoring movement after paralysis; and restoring amputations.  Each and every one of these healings is mentioned within the OT Scriptures as evidence of the identity of the Messiah -- and each have been fulfilled by Jesus.  This is one of the MANY reasons why the Jews of His time *should* have recognized Him as Messiah ... but sadly, the prophecy of Isaiah 53 came true in that He was rejected.    Show your son passages such as these in the NT, so he will see that Jesus restored amputees:  Matthew 15:30 ("maimed" indicates an amputation had occured, as proven by Matthew 18:18) and Luke 22:50-51.  In both instances, Jesus publically healed amputees, proving that He alone holds the power to heal such serious injuries.|`|4boTYkt7aa	I would explain that God can do anything,but at the same time He cannot be involved in everyone's lives everyday because if He did,that would go against what He has said about Him wanting us to have faith.And if we saw,would we have faith?No because faith is not seeing and believing anyway.God didn't bring sickness and death into the world,we did.Remember?|`|dbw210qqaa	Yes, God can recreate limbs|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	Yes God can restore a limb and probably has though not here in the States because no one would believe that it was real. God does great miracles in places like Kenya, the Congo, Darfur and the Sudan because they will believe that it is from God and will not question or doubt. Missionaries from all faiths have witnessed great miracles some have seen things, that their denominations tell them that God doesn't do. Like the person above who says God does not do miracles today, these missionaries go back to their churches and usually leave them because they know this teaching is wrong, and when they try to tell them what they have seen they are reprimanded. People are raised from the dead and healed of incurable diseases every day, but God can only work these miracles where He is welcome and worshiped with all their hearts. God refuses to act to prove His existence.  So those who say God has never restored a limb are  arrogant in their ignorance. God chooses where and when He will cure someone for His own reasons and we are not to question this. We don't have to like it but God is sovereign and does as He wants not as we want. If God created us why would He not be able to restore a limb?|`|angPpFY7aa	With the truth that God isn't real.|`|XeiTdhyUaa	Amputees that have been healed: 0  God: 0|`|ATPPWOpWaa	In a way, no He cannot.

Jesus also restored the ear of the soldier that one of the disciples cut off when Jesus was being arrested. And Jesus raised the dead.    Why does no one do such great things today? Well some Christians are healers, but that is not everyone's gift.     But mainly, because we aren't living for the flesh, but for the Spirit.    Romans 8:13,14  For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if by the spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. For those who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.     Romans 8:28  We know that all things work for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose.   .|`|b2dUtX0raa	This page attempts to answer that very question: http://whywontgodhealamputees.com/

A man is more than his masculinity, even as a woman is more than her femininity. Your assertion that "if I liked someone feminine, i'd just be straight and go out with girls" is silly. Not all women are feminine, and not all men are masculine.    Again, if you like manly men then find one. Don't complain about those men that don't fit your tastes.|`|AoLS7XXTaa	Some gay men don't act Feminine at all, they hide it well too.  Other gay men who do show femininity are usually "proud" about it :/      gl... :):):)|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	"why do most gay men feel the necessity to act feminine?"    *facepalm*|`|DMfNi6Pwaa	they are insecure|`|fFmbBRbcaa	you just cant notice the butch ones so much and i like fem boys theres nothing wrong with them|`|Mok3ewI2aa	It comes natural.|`|K2o7xcstaa	I don't know but that's always something I've wondered. I think it's because most gay men feel feminine because they are attracted to guys.|`|SmVxLo1aaa	idkk. they just sumtimes feel like a gurl. Like, u feel like a boy. They just sumtimes have the impulse to pretend that they r a gurl.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	It isn't most gay men, but there are many out there that prefer to feel feminine. Many gay men like a feminine man, but don't necessarily like women.|`|2nQynHp7aa	I don't act: I'm just me and I do whatever comes to mind. People have described me as in between and that shows that I don't follow a set path of feminist or masculine attitudes, again I'm just being myself.|`|PLZrvfFEaa	Because they saw your face.|`|3J0utfJXaa	becuase usealy in the relationsship there is a girl and boy same works for gay people their is a more feminine one in the relation then the man (LOL no iffnese but how what turns you on, your probably the more feminie one) but thats mostly the reason, that all has to do with DNA and while the child is in the womb and molecules and everything, their cells have a gender confusion cause they mix, so more then others, thats how most people turn out gay.|`|0ufpOygTaa	I would think that the majority of gay men are actually masculine. Many times I've seen men who are totally straight (at least I thought) and found they are gay. I also just assume any masculine acting man is straight out of respect for others.    There are others also that are just so conspicuously gay because of being feminine. I think there are so many different types that it ultimately depends on individuals' tastes. I for instance has many features considered feminine in masculine standards but do not at all behave effeminately.|`|u6K5TtRlaa	Most gay men don't feel the necessity to act feminine. They just feel more comfortable doing so. I don't feel like I act very feminine very often. Sure, I have my moments, but most people wouldn't even be able to tell I was gay until I mentioned my boyfriend. You're much more likely to notice the femme guys because they're much easier to spot.    Do you make a conscious effort to act masculine? Do you try and govern the gestures you make in conversation or the weight you put in your steps? Do you pick out clothes because you consciously want them to be masculine, or because you think they help you present the image that you want to present? The thing is that feminine guys are just being who they feel they are. Perhaps it's influenced by gender roles in society, sure, but only so much as your masculinity is. In the same way that none of us can help being gay, none of us can really help being feminine or masculine.    When it comes to anything gay, nobody's making a conscious choice to be different, be it sexuality or femininity.|`|fp7yIOBhaa	I think it is a lack of confidence.
Xsen794Aaa	If you know tones, it's "gong1 xi3 fa1 cai2."  "Fat" is the Cantonese romanization for the same word.  "Gong he fat choi" is the whole Cantonese phrase, but you look like you're asking about Mandarin.    Breaking it down, "gong" is pronounced how it looks; the 'o' is like "oh," but you don't close your lips an "oo" sound at the end like we do in English.  It's first tone, meaning it has a high, flat musical note.    "Xi" is kind of like the English "she," but the 'x' part is pronounced with the the 'ss' sound in "mass" and the regular 'sh,' or, it's kind of like softly whistling 'sh.'  It's third tone, meaning that it's pronounced low, then drops lower and comes back up.    "Fa" is first tone like "gong," and it's pronounced like how it looks.  It's like "Fa la la la la."    The 'c' in "cai" is like saying 'ts' as in "gets."  The 'ai' diphthong is pronounced like "eye" and the whole syllable is second tone, meaning it rises like the last syllable of a question.    Hope that helps.|`|Lc17QNBmaa	Are you trying to say "happy new year" in chinese??

AA12006309	While it's sad that they can remove LGBT students from school, it's not illegal.  Private, religious institutions do not have to follow the same rules at public schools, because they don't receive public money.  Therefore, if a student violates the religious teachings of that school (or in some cases, if their parents violate them, as is the case with a lesbian couple's daughter in Ontario), they are within their rights to expel them.    Yes it's not right.  Yes it's not fair.  But it is not illegal.|`|nMLomteraa	Do midwest dwellers have the right to deny housing to GLBT???!!    Apperently, the answer is "Yes!

In private institutions, they should be able to hate or exclude whomever their ignorance dictates. I am a fan of tolerance and acceptance, but I am also a fan of the law.|`|fFmbBRbcaa	definitely not that so messed up!!!!!!! first they take our way to marry now they want to take away gay kids rights to go to a decent school!!!|`|oY4vwdjVaa	I don't want to give a load of money to people who hate gays and then have THEM teach my child. Why would anyone else? I'm glad their vocal about their hatred towards human kind. It lets me know to stay the heck away from them.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Sadly if they are not receiving government funding then they do have a right to exclude students based on what ever specs they choose, however if this was a job setting then they would get their tushy sued! Someday children will get the same rights as adults! Until then we speak out!|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Fair doesn't matter.  Legality does.    They are private schools.  As long as they don't receive state money for education (some do, it's a very gray area), they can really do whatever they want.    Have the state pass a law stating something along the lines of must not discriminate to receive accreditation and that would change, but expect that law to be challenged as well.|`|RhX0TxOBaa	I feel sorry for the GLBT students who go there and now have to worry about being expelled because of something they can't change.|`|S2mTsV1vaa	This is a human right's violation in my opinion...But that's life isn't it? Two steps forward, one step back.|`|TLOgBy3caa	Well, what do you want me to say, yes?  Of course not.   But private schools are evil anyway, trust me I used to go to one. I don't recommend it.|`|neuprBeGaa	Absolutely.  It's a PRIVATE group - they have the right to exclude people.      I do think they should have to forfeit any government funding they might be receiving...and I would neither attend the school myself nor allow my children to do so.  But I think it should be allowed.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	No, it is not.  Simple as that.  I guess they think Jesus would kick them out as well.|`|PSzzjf4naa	The parents of the kids need to organize to demand that the schools  welcome gays  -|`|KszocgnSaa	No its not fair or right but what can ya do?

That directly interferes with those students rights as human beings. Have they never heard of the constitution and the rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.|`|KAiHiHkGaa	No, it's not fair.  It's disgusting.|`|2dfe1a04cbba62e3fc3fa1e11c8562e9aa	Yes, it is fair. It is a private school. It can set its own rules and policies for acceptance and conduct. Just as a private mens club does not have to accept women, a religious private school that does not accept homosexuality does not have to accept homosexual students, and has the right to expel any student that fails to honor its policies.|`|HnEcgVGiaa	This is actually fair.    Remember, the schools were CHRISTIAN schools. And if those schools' doctrines and principles say that G&L marriages are immoral, then you can't do anything about that. They schools are practicing their Constitutional rights. And since the schools are private, the students cannot do anything to overturn the Constitutional rights the Christian schools have.    Students enter private schools based on applications. If they don't meet the standards, they can't attend. It's the same for colleges and scholarships. If you don't have the score, the money, the racial background (for scholarships), you aren't eligible.    It's just the way it is. They aren't HATING GLBT students. It's not about hate, but how it reflects their beliefs and principles.|`|BU8GnAw0aa	No it's not right.|`|6e5a57787c3f60d43faa7cb6bcd04815aa	No way is it fair.  And if that school gets any government money whatsoever, it is also illegal.|`|tNRM86lXaa	thats mean of dem|`|OsY0lmTCaa	It depends on your point of view I suppose. From a legal perspective I'd say that it's a potential violation of the students civil rights. The civil rights act of 1964 doesn't specifically mention homosexuality, but it can be used to protect homosexuals given certain criteria are met.    From another legal perspective, it's their right as a privately run institution to use whichever criteria they wish, so long as they don't violate the civil rights of others.    Morally I think it's reprehensible to use a persons orientation as a reason not to provide the best possible education.

For example, I had a feeling that I was different when I was seven but I didn't know for sure until I was in the 6th grade.|`|KszocgnSaa	It varies quite a bit but I would guess during or after puberty 11-18.

Women are encouraged to teach other women (Titus 2:3-5). The Bible also does not restrict women from teaching children.   Titus 2:35 (NIV)  3 Likewise, teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live, not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine, but to teach what is good. 4 Then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children, 5 to be self-controlled and pure, to be busy at home, to    Edit:  ...Matthew 28:19-20 states what has come to be called the Great Commission: "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.

Woman, children and those new to the faith. Those that have been baptized but their knowledge is less then hers.    1Ti 2:13  For Adam was first formed, then Eve. This is why. Man has been in charge of the preaching (Prophets and Priests) and in charge of the temple under the Old Testament law (The Tribe of Levi) Man has always been in charge of been the spoke person for God. Woman can to as long as she dose not usurp mans authority.

So...yeah, He did.  I mean, why would He call it a church, when everyone else around had temples?  idk.|`|DS4HDNiHaa	Jesus founded a Church which started as a sect within Jadaism.  The early Chirstians went to the Synagogue on Saturday and went to mass (fellowship, breaking of bread or eucharist) on Sunday.  Then the Jews drove away the Christians and the Church (Christianity) spun off to become a separation religion.|`|nqBrmt0waa	it's actually a cult.    The largest cult ever.

Somebody's messin' with you ;-)|`|2105679b5ae2ed7da4e55b9bba319628aa	No Jesus was Jewish and remained in the Jewish faith. Christianity is a cult started by Paul. He based it on the resurrection myth.|`|xpvbDnthaa	Definitely.      Today the only clue that many people recognize as authoritative is the Bible.  And except for a couple of decades represented by what's now known as the New Testament, only the book of Genesis was written about a people outside of the Mosaic Covenant.  That is the Law and Covenant given to Moses after the Children of Israel were caught worshiping the golden calf etc.      What that means is that every book that we now have was written by some prophet or scribe living under the Law of Moses.  Christ taught a much higher law ie. no more "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," rather "love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you" etc.      Then there's the minor fact that he battled Satan in Gethsemane (and won) then submitted himself to the injustice of the cross thereby off- setting the Universal laws of Justice.  That is; breaking laws (aka sin) brings entropy of that life form (aka death). Since Christ broke no laws he didn't have to die, yet after victory in Gethsemane, he submitted himself to the temper- tantrum of the adversary (aka Crucifixion). Subsequently the earth gave him back his body (aka Resurrection) thus breaking the bands of death for all (aka Universal Resurrection).  Thus becoming the Savior and Redeemer of all human kind.  The ultimate act of love.  Yet retaining the ultimate universal law of personal agency or right to choose future progression by obeying laws (keeping commandments).      Now that's a new religion.|`|7e83d02aea426afae2358c95ac7592daaa	pretty much both (though I wouldn't call it new)|`|eUXe2wtWaa	He didn't start the religion.

Jesus came to give us the New Testament of God, but it was the same religion as always. The true one.    =]     -  "no, christianity is the truth, jesus started truth. Christianity is not a religion it is the truth. Islam and atheism are religions." -      um, dude, I get what you're saying and it's right... in a way. religion  actually means "belief in god"|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Christianity is not a religion but a way of life started by Jesus.    Acts 11:26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.

WHAT!?|`|k3LbhASGaa	It also says  how can you call me lord and not do what I say|`|m3Igki7qaa	NO, it is speaking truth.    Christians have to live a repentant lifestyle. A gay person in a homosexual relationship is not repentant.    What is hypocricy is "asking a question" about a person's answer and then blocking that person, like you did to Super Kiteh. I guess he gives answers that are too hard for you to refute.|`|PkBMMvqTaa	If i stole something, and then admitted i did it, said i was sorry, and turned away from doing it again, that is one thing.   But actively continuing in sin, no matter what the sin is, means that we really are not sorry for it, nor does it show that we have turned from repeating it again.    so, no touchdown, it was 4th down, the other team takes possession.    *.You yourself are pointing out other peoples "judgemental" ways......you fumbled again....other team picks it up.....and scores...........    * YOU JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ANYONE WHO SAYS THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THE  GAY LIFESTYLE. that is really your issue.....

In Christian schools, the majority (|`|RyhluHk3aa	It seems to me that a group of Christians would want the opportunity to show a person where they are in error, in the practice of such a lifestyle. The very meaning of living as a Christian is to allow the risen Lord Jesus to live His resurrected life through you.     Hmmm.... not sure what to say on this one.|`|K24JFTOcaa	yes, i agree the person who answered probably isn't perfect|`|QoenvlFuaa	All have sinned, but *thank God* we are forgiven. It doesn't sound (from the article) like the two girls were repentant (which means sorry for the sin and asks for forgiveness) for their homosexuality. I got the impression that they were openly gay and proud of it, but also wanted to go to the private Christian school. You can't have your cake and eat it too. The only difference between people (because ALL are sinners) is who is repentant and has been forgiven, and who is not repentant and has not been forgiven. The school accepts sinners (duh!), but not the ones who throw the sin in their face.    THE CALL ON THE FIELD WAS OVERTURNED!  Silly boy.......|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	Private institutions are allowed to have their own standards.  We WOULD be hypocrites if we stopped having standards that the Bible lays down quite clearly.  Its our reponsibility to follow them and it very clearly states that we are NOT to tolerate sexual immorality in the church.  And a Christian school is an extension of the church.    The Bible doesnt say ALL HAVE SINNED for the purposes of abandoning standards for right and wrong.  The verse that says that is Romans 3 and if you read the whole thing, it points out the need for Gods righeousness and grace.    Gays need Gods grace and righeousness but nobody can obtain it when they live, eat, breath, and accept in their own lives; sexual immorality.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Out in the open, public sin like homosexuality is quite different from most other sins, especially since homosexuals insist on public displays of their deviant behavior, expecting to somehow gain society's approval.|`|e4yczpKsaa	lol. If you can PROVE to me that this is true. I will no longer be a Christian. That is so...terrible to treat others like that. You shouldn't openly judge anyone. You SHOULD accept them.
AA11056188	Here was the real situation! The Pharisees brought the woman to Jesus claiming that she had been caught in the act of adultery. Why would they do this? The pharisees were the religious leaders of their day and they knew the law very well. If she had really been caught in the act then the law stated that she was to be put to death so why bring her to Jesus? This whole incident was staged as the Pharisees were looking for a way to have Christ put to death for speaking our against the law as after all, they hated Him because He was a threat to their position. We note here that the Pharisees failed to produce the man too which was also wrong on their part. The Pharisees were hoping that the Lord would simply say "let her go" and if He had said this He would have been guilty of speaking against the Law which was punishable by death. The Lord knew their heart and their intentions. On the othe hand, If the Lord had said "Stone her" then this would have been contrary to what He had stated in John 3:17 which was "For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved" There was no real proof that this woman was in fact caught in the act of adultery and it is highly probable that some or most of the Pharisees had been with her themselves at some time in the past. Jesus knew their hardened hearts and their wicked intentions. He totally preempted their evil trap by stating that whosoever was without sin, let him cast the first stone. This reply neither spoke out against the law, or brought condemnation upon her, or went contrary to His statement in John 3:17. This event was staged in order to have Christ found guilty of speaking against the law and they could have therefore pressed for his death after all, if the woman had been caught in the act, why bring her to Jesus and ask Him what they should do? In the end Jesus said that he did not condemn her not because he had gone soft on her but also because the Pharisees had also failed to produce the man. I hope this helps. God Bless!|`|346e6e2923d4e46195fcf8100cba96beaa	There is no need to analyze it.  It's proven to be spurious.    Some editions of the Bible have removed it or put it in a footnote to refine the Bible text. Other additions were also found and deleted.|`|USd2LAOUaa	The writer who put these words in the Mouth of Jesus wanted to make a point that Jesus didn't agree with the Law of Moses....It was all a part of the abrogation of the Torah project initiated by Paul...|`|feBJEgcgaa	You nail your hand to a table...|`|zefFTf8Aaa	it means we are all sinners, and we should judge others    1 But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 2 Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst 4 they said to him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?" 6 This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her." 8 And once more he bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 9 But when they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus looked up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?" 11 She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin again."|`|VnFOCEgaaa	It means simply to not judge others when you are liable to be judged yourself. Jesus reminded the men that they could also be judged guilty of breaking the Law of Moses. Jesus also said judge not that ye not be judged.

If there is a gay gene, it is God that put it there for people to be challenged to live a godly life despite their inclinations.    Murder is never ok.

If there were ever to be a criminal sanction in regards to abortion, it should be applied directly to the abortionist. And I don't think that the death penalty would be appropriate.    It really seems to be unlikely at this point that Roe v. Wade will be overturned in the foreseeable future. I believe that those of us in the pro-life camp should be focusing our efforts on counseling adoption and birth ccontrol.

4DoXXqxOaa	It means that you get your psychic powers from your ancestors and the people before you I am the same type of psychic|`|5YVfVhRUaa	i have deja vu sometimes too.i don't think much of it.these psychic people just try to turn everything into some "source of energy" and all that stuff.i think its just all bull.but yea its probably just normal deja vu you just get it a little more often.ask a doctor if anyone about it if you still aren't sure.
8k6kxOh2aa	have you ever had any other experiences or odd things that happened to you? odd souls are typically indigo children, crystal children/adults, and starchildren(starseed).   have you ever had any other hints of psychic abilitys?  if so, what were they?  can you see a person's aura color? (the color of the energy field that surrounds an object)    here's a good site about these souls.  http://www.starchild.co.za/what.html    i myself am an indigo child, and if you ever have anything you would like to talk about, i would be pleased to help.    edit:  i mean old souls..not odd souls. sorry. typo :(  ~stardriven09|`|IzHfbWtiaa	I agree with bio!|`|FyvbF8vEaa	It happens to most of us.

I once heard a theory that de ja vu happens when this happens too quickly.

On his head thank you Jesus. The boy was smited. It was terrible. His tongue hung kind of sloppy from the corner of his lip cause he was kissing them Frenchies. Dear God. Such a lonely fellow. We's all Black People now, Jesus. We pimpin for our Lord thank you Father. He's still running, after that toad kissed His lips. I think it was Judas with his tongue getting all twisted up in the Lord's beard. God's house was gettin fumagated right now after He heard about the roach and had Hisself a heart attack poor thing. Susan was standing right next to Him gettin herself a ride or something cause that Jesus was coming. I just don't know what become of that scarred up Son of His.

The most logical explanation is that we are actually remembering something we have already done that was very similar, since most of us repeat similar experiences or have similar conversations repeatedly throughout our lives.  It doesn't mean a person is a psychic.|`|Kbry7CnOaa	It means the Matrix is changing...|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	wikipedia it.     it happens to pretty much everyone.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	Histories repeats itself but we never seem to learn from it . don't be taken in by psychics plying upon your vulnerability.

AA10025824	I'm sure they do.  Not openly in the US of course or the employer would be in trouble, but Jews have been discriminated against for thousands of years and it continues.|`|7KJcMpl9aa	It can be, just like any other minority group.  A lot of people don't like the Jews, for whatever reason.|`|1vxM2zofaa	no|`|TvuILSmYaa	No, but in my school, there's a jewish teacher and she's always facing discrimination...|`|4BQXYxPYaa	In the past, yes, this was an issue.

However now it's illegal to discriminate and it's illegal for an employeer to ask a potential employee their religion.|`|AA10405801	Yes they do.

Those that say they hate all (insert group here) are no better than any other person that does that. There is such a thing as taking the moral high ground, and not lowering ones self to such pitiful levels, but sadly it is human nature to lower ones self so long as they can possibly do harm to those they disagree with, or hate.|`|	Well, being gay isn't a "lifestyle choice" Take it from someone who knows. Also, some Christians are obnoxious (therefore, all Christians are seen that way and hated); gays are not.|`|	Because, there is a large difference. Gays have been fighting for equal rights for the last 40 years. Christians are a large majority.   No one feels sorry for Christians. Gays have been beaten and bashed, and hated for years, and still are. Have Christians?   It is not the same, in anyway.|`|	"Most likely would happen" is not the same as will happen or has happened.  In many areas, saying that you hate gays will not cause a stir, and while Christians (at least if they are true to their religion) are not likely to provoke violence, you would definitely get responses in some areas as well.    I'd say that your "hypothetical" doesn't hold water.|`|	I know what cha mean. I dunno why that it is this way. Thats just how the world is today. We can only pray that it will get better.|`|	What a great question.  I'll definitely use it.|`|	you're leaving quite a few factors out. first, have you been all around the world to see this first hand? and the nation isn't openly hating christianity... we still can't separate church and state. however, there are laws against certain gay rights that are guaranteed to them as human being (pursuit of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - there is no exclusion of gay people). so, it only makes sense to stand up for things and speak out against something you disagree with. how many people call customer service to applaud their service? no, people call when they have a problem with the way things are going.|`|	Double standards. Christians are the whipping boys of secular society.|`|	Please cite an example of someone walking around and saying "I hate all Christians", and being stood up for by others.|`|	what pople??    lulz|`|	Being gay isn't a choice.

We always check to see if there's a western movie  we missed and watch it when it's on. For you never know if it will be  re shown. I think until some new ones are made, there are very few  left we haven't seen. But we still check, just in case. And we did  find two on recently that were new to us.    The Home and Garden Channel is a channel with so many different  options to view during the day and night. Not only do they focus on  home improvements, and interior design, they also give you an idea  of the property values across the US. To give you a better idea of  what homes cost from location to location. It's a channel to check out  when the movie channels are disappointing, and local channels are  just plain boring with network programming.      We also check the History Channel and the Food Network when  all else fails.|`|9YwZL1Jhaa	HGTV and the Food Channel.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	I watch the History Channel, Science and National Geographic.

Sounds like someone from his work sent an email    EDIT again: this is a real answer to someone's question about photosynthesis in plants    Water is split up into H+ and OH- ions. The H+ reduces NADP into NADPH2 (NADP is an acronym for some nicotine amide thingy)    Then there is the OH- ion and that is used to turn into into O2 and H2O molecules. O2 is released into the atmosphere and H2O is used by the plant again  --------------------------------------...  Next is Photophosphorylation    In this the chlorophyll molecule gets excited with light and releases an electron. This electron combines with a phosphate.    This phosphate then bonds with adenosine diphsophate to make adenosine triphosphate.    At the end ATP NADPH2 and O2 are formed
6RCHJQfQaa	Haha.  You are kidding right?  Do I really have to answer this?  When I read this question I am reminded of the passage in Mark 16:14 where Jesus rebuked the disciples for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn't believe Jesus had arose from the dead.  We silly humans trivialize Jesus Christ with our man made doctrines and dogmas and we fail to remember Jesus died for our sins and arose from the grave.  Jesus commanded his disciples to "do this in remembrance of me" when he broke the bread and shared the cup with them.  Transubstantiation, Consubstantiation, Open Communion, Closed Communion, Close Communion, Catholic way, Protestant way, which one is correct?  If we have to ask that the answer is none of the above.  If we spend most of the time argueing about the format when do we spend time remembering Jesus?|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Consubstantiation is a Lutheran concept.    If Lutherans had a valid priesthood and valid sacraments it might be worth the trouble of debating it.    But since they don't, the point is totally moot.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	transubstantiation  ref: 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh."     there is nothing symbolic in this verse or in the following.    sorry CJ|`|2AyOs3DHaa	neither its a satanic lie both of them
LzPOzoJVaa	OMG I totally agree with you.  I get in fights with my parents all the time about this, because my Stepdad is a detective.  He claims that the law is always right, but I have always disagreed.  I feel like the law is somewhat like a paradox.  For example:  I claimed it to be retarded that People who murder face the death penalty, so basically, they are getting murdered for murdering.    My dad claims that this is a warning to other people.      If that is the reason, then they should banish the death penalty just because it isn't working!  There are still murderers, so their reason is left as failure.    I find that a lot of law is like that.      If you are religous, then I believe that the rules are built within the book, and your goal of right is to be just like Jesus.    However, If you aren't religous, then where are your laws?  Where do they come from?  They are created from the depths of man's mind, and if you think about it, that is wrong.    It is in the depths of man's mind that one commits murder anyways, in the depths of man's mind that they justify their wrong doing, so why should we let the man's mind also make the rules?  Because the man has yet to commit their crime?  We are all sinners.  A sinner shouldn't make the law, only God should.  But, that is just my opinion.,|`|q8iQhYHgaa	OPIONS ARE AN ANSWERS, WHETHER YOU  ARE FOR OR AGAINEST SOMETHING. RIGHT OR WRONG IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE DONE|`|75bcffedeed2e98b419c4ef51d05351faa	If there wasn't right and wrong ... what would there be?  Just think about your question.  Of course humans have opinions ... but they also know what's right and wrong ... each of us do.|`|QobOFiCLaa	There's no such thing as absolute so everything is relative, just an opinion like you said. The whole purpose of life is to make order out of chaos. Instead of random molecules, molecules are arranged to form organisms and everything above the atomic level follows a pattern of some sort. What's right is whatever allows time and space and life to continue as orderly as possible, what's wrong is whatever causes chaos. Most of what people consider right is to some extent a way to keep or order or achieve peace or something to that end.|`|RUxRNsf4aa	We are wrong to say what is right and what is wrong!     Arent we? Even just saying the above statement defies itself. I have actually often wondered this myself. Especially with some of our laws. It makes sense among the majority of us humans to have at least some laws, such as a law against murder, and the more obvious ones that are for protection like that, but what about laws against drugs? laws against multiple wives/husbands? Gay/lesbian laws? Laws that disrupt peoples lives. Who are we to say that two men or two women cant be together? Just because they cant produce offspring doesnt mean they wont be happy together. "Protect and Serve" the government is supposed to do, how is hindering peoples happiness to be together part of that? Or peoples happiness to do drugs part of that? I think we should get rid of all the little nit-picking laws that dont fall directly under protect and serve, and create one law that is called the "happiness law". Where everyone can do whatever they want to make themselves happy as long as it doesnt harm the environment or people around them. Thats my opinion though.     I really like this question. I am going to add you to my contacts just incase you have anymore creative questions.|`|FCKdRZd1aa	hello out there is there anyone else that can tell us different?

SfS4d0gkaa	When the correct definition is used for homosexual, (which I don't believe to be correct in the Bible), I have no problem with it at all.  I think the Christian Church has done way too much damage to homosexuals as we know them today.  And I see no problem with them getting married despite what the Bible says.  The Bible portrays homosexuals as hateful men raping men heterosexuals in terms of Sodom & Gomorrah as a form of humiliation or used as a form of "temple prostitution".  That isn't how we define homosexuality anymore.  And the fact that God made Adam and Eve doesn't mean that Adam & Steve can't marry.  That is just an assumption Christians have made, or rather, might prefer.    Also, I think it is an "abomination" that some Christians say that God "hates" homosexuals.  In reality, a loving God doesn't hate homosexuals.  Children who realize they are gay are bewildered & lost when basically everyone hates them for their orientation... even God hating them.  But everyone, Christians alike, refuse to take ANY responsibility for young gay high suicide rates.  This needs to end.  Christian beliefs have already taken far too many young and talented lives away.  This is what is an abomination today, and if God is out there, it hasn't gone unnoticed.|`|pO8OzblHaa	They love you, they just hate everything about you and all the things that you stand for. At least, most of them.|`|AA11640108	Its OK by me.|`|CNotcjbaaa	I feel so bad, for you confused people. I totally understand and love you guys, you're just confused.

(Let me clarify, being attracted to people of the opposite gender is not a sin. Having sexual relations with people of the opposite gender, even within the context of marriage, is a sin.)     But more importantly, God loves homosexuals, like He loves every other sinner, which would be everyone. End of story.|`|AA10311549	In spite of many replies here, the BIBLE is NOT clear that a loving committed same-sex relationship is immoral.    Many people would be earnest in saying that it is important to love our fellow man. Unfortunately many people have brough great harm and pain to those they love because of ignorance. But I am confident that just as our ignorance about slavery and women's rights has been enlightened and many wrongs in our Christian history have finally been righted, eventually too Christianity will finally realize that a loving committed same-sex relationship is a GOOD thing not only for the people involved but for society as a whole.    It is my total belief that Paul never had understanding of sexual orientation or exclusive honmosexuality. Nor did he understand that two gay people CAN live in a loving committed relationship. Read Romans Ch 1 and you will realize that his view of homosexual behavior had to do with people FIRST abandoning God and then being given over to their lusts. Thus he could NOT have been condemning what he knew nothing about.    Many Churches and theologians believe that being gay and being Christian are NOT in opposition.    There are a number of Christian Churches which DO teach tolerance and do accept gays and lesbians. One of these, specifically founded to serve the gay and lesbian community is the Metropolitan Community Church.

As Christians, we must do what Jesus did. Jesus preached repentence of sin. Homosexual conduct is sin. All sin is a choice.  Mat 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.   When Jesus forgave someone he said "Go and sin no more." (John 5:14, 8:11)     Here is one of the many passages that says homosexual sex is sin.    Romans 1:25Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.   26For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:   27And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.   32Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.    We see here that homosexual behavior is unnatural and that their affections are called vile, as is said in the book of Judges (Jud 19:22-25) It should be noted that the word translated "unseemly" is to-ay-baw', to-ay-baw'  Feminine active participle of H8581; properly something disgusting (morally), that is, (as noun) an abhorrence; especially idolatry or (concretely) an idol: - abominable (custom, thing), abomination. So we see the apostle Paul called homosexual conduct an abomination, just as the Old Testament does. (Leviticus 18:22-30)|`|kFpFU97zaa	Frankly, who cares what they think?  It's you and your life.

The Confederate battle flag represents all Confederates, regardless of race or religion, and is the symbol of less government, less taxes, and the right of a people to govern themselves. It is flown in memory and honor of our Confederate ancestors and veterans who willingly shed their blood for Southern independence.

Some have blonde hair and blue eyes, some are from the Middle east and look like they are from there, some are polish, some are German, some are British, some are French. This is not a racial question, although some jews say that they are a race, I find it difficult to believe that a race of people can have so many different looking people with so many different looking qualities. It! It's like saying what does an American look like? We are a mixed bunch. We have no physical characteristics that describes us as a people. We are all different! My friend Terry's family comes from Poland, they have blonde hair, blue eyes.Both her parents were Jews. Russian Jews have different characteristics, but they are still jews, see what I am saying? It is not a question that can be answered like you have asked! Even in Israel not all Jewish people look the same. Go and see for yourself. God Bless K|`|civJQaEkaa	i live near a large chasidic jewish community. chasidic jews are one of the strictest groups or sects of jews in the judaic religion. first off these jews are caucasian. depending on the person they can either be blue eyed blonde hair to black hair and brown eyes. some are darker than others. you can't tell what the women's hair looks like because they wear wigs but the girls and younger women that arent married don't wear wigs. they do have a similar look to them. this is because they have hebrew/israeli blood mixed with european blood because before they came to america they came from europe and before europe they came from israel. yes judaism is a religion, anyone can be jewish but when ppl say they are jewish as their race or ethnicity they mean they have ancesters from israel who were hebrew. ofcourse the hebrews were jewish so they say they "look jewish" instead of hebrew. i can just tell an ethnically jewish person apart from another type of caucasian because of the facial features.|`|vEEeq7kYaa	This is going to be LONG but detailed. I'm going to cover a lot of ground to help clear up some widespread and common misconceptions among non-Jews about Jews.  We are not a race and there is NO single Jewish ethnicity. Judaism is a religion.  Jewish identity isn't always by religion, but according to Jewish law. Now let me explain.    Jews are a nation people, Israel (tribal origin) bound by an eternal covenant of the faith (religion) of Judaism. We are like a huge family and only the family can determine who is a member of it. It is the laws of Judaism, given to the covenant nation, Israel, in the Torah, that determine Jewish identity.  It is not a matter of blood but of self-determination through the laws of the Jewish people.    The Jewish people are considered both a nation and a religion. Our connection is primarily one of faith (religion) through the covenant of Israel, yet membership is also conferred by birth, through matrilineal descent .One may also become a part of the nation Israel by adoption of the faith of Judaism and formal procedures of conversion.    One who converts to Judaism is considered as FULLY Jewish as one born Jewish and their children are Jews. This has been the case since the times of the Torah.    However one can be a Jew and not belong to both. One may technically be a Jew if their mother is a Jew, but apostate to the covenant of Israel and no longer considered a member of the nation if they leave it for the covenant of faith of another religion. We are Klal Yisrael, the community of Israel, and have a shared " destiny" and history.. Many different and distinctly Jewish cultures and ethnicities have developed over the millennia in Diaspora lands.  The Diaspora refers to the Jewish presence outside of Israel after the destruction of the First and Second Temple periods and the Bar Kochba revolt.     There is no ONE Jewish ethnicity, but a great many ethnicities that are distinctly Jewish. There are the Mizrahi (from the Middle East and North Africa).The Sephardi (Spanish) and the Ashkenazi, (German, Polish, Russian and other Eastern European)that are all slightly different, even within those three designations as to cultural practices and foods, but it is the faith and covenant that binds them all together as Klal Yisrael.     The Jewish nation began as a group of tribes and our connection to one another is still from the perspective of a tribal nation. ( example:as the Lakota nation has tribal procedure and law to determine who is a memberof their tribe, who is not, who is expelled and who is adopted, so does Judaism.)  One born a member of the tribal covenant nation Israel ( Jewish) may not be observant or even believe in God and theyre still a full member, a Jew. They may not be a good member or an active member but theyve not renounced membership. That is how one may be an "atheist Jew", they still may live Jewish ethics and identify with their people, but they did not take on foreign beliefs contradictory to monotheism or Torah. Now if one born into the covenant becomes apostate to it through rejection of the covenant by adoption of another belief contradictory to the covenant, they are still be considered a Jew, but for all intents and purposes, they're not given the status of a member. According to Jewish law they're not counted in a minyan, can't be buried in a Jewish cemetery, cannot be given honors to go up to read Torah at a synagogue, and may not speak for the Jewish people. They CAN however, return without formal conversion should they so desire and then be embraced again  as full members. One who has left the Jewish people for the foreign faith of another people must undergo the steps of TESHUVAH , which means repentance and return to the God of Israel. Some groups may require that the individual also requires immersion in the mikveh before being accepted back, but they do not require the formal steps of conversion should the person wish to return.    It is Jewish law alone, not Christianity or any other entity that determines the status of who and what is Jewish. When a Jew adopts a belief that is in conflict with the Jewish religion, the belief does NOT become a " Jewish belief" just because a Jew chooses to believe in it. THAT is the conflict Jews have with the Christians who call themselves Jews if deceptively try to present their Christian belief AS Judaism. A Jew who converts to Hare Krishna is just as apostate, but there exists no Jews for Hare Krishna or Hare Krishna Judaism evangelic groups spending millions of dollars a year in campaigns to convert secular Jews by convincing them it is a form of Judaism.      Jews are in NO way a RACE..other than as members of the human race. While Hitler did not create that notion of Jews as a race, as it began in the late 1800's, he did use it and many other things against Jewish law in order to discredit and persecute Jews.That false of Jews as a race has never been a part of Jewish identity and those who spread it are unwittingly spreading a notion vorn of antisemitism. Both the concept that the dogma of a contradictory religion to Judaism or the pseudo scientific ideas of antisemites(Nazis) have authority to determine Jewish identity OVER the right of the laws of the people in question , reveals utter disregard and disrespect of the right of the Jewish people to self-determination according to Jewish law with regard to who is or is not a Jew.    You can become a member of a tribe or nation if you meet the criteria of citizenship. And the covenant people, Klal Yisrael, remain as in the earliest days of the covenant..a nation. It hasn't changed.It is against Jewish law for any Jew to discriminate against a convert to Judaism. Since the time of the Torah converts have been accepted as fully Jewish, and this is the case in all branches. We are not even supposed to refer to the fact that they are converts! It is up to |`|jdKTs3aHaa	it varies.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	It can vary, but many Jews have large noses.

Like any other race, anyone who believes in the Jewish (or hebrew) faith can come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. For example, the Jews who inhabit Israel can have the features of Northern Europeans (i.e. Italy or Northern Spain), but at the same time they can have more Palestine, Iranian and Northern African features (curly to course hair, dark to olive skin, light brown to dark greenish/brown eyes). There  are some who're tall and slim and some who're short and husky. It just all depends on ones genes and the origins in which their blood line originated from.

There's no blood involved -- and we don't give transfusions when you convert.    Seriously, one the big things about the Holocaust was that anti-Jewish killing used to be escaped if you converted.  Hitler took ideas of the time, & shifted Jews into a race & ethnicity that could be called inferior & killed just for that.

The Alexandrian manuscripts, the Complutensian edition, and the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac, and Arabic versions, all read, "the Lord God"; and the Ethiopic version only has "God". Most modern translations have "the Lord God", which was used as a Greek substitute for the expression "Yahweh [Jehovah] God", that appears many times in the Old Testament.     Likewise, with the phrases "the Lord our God" and "the Lord your God": These phrases are always used in reference to Jehovah, the God and Father of our Lord Jesus. -- Matthew 4:7 (Deuteronomy 6:16); Matthew 4:10 (Deuteronomy 6:13; 10:20); Matthew 22:37 (Deuteronomy 6:5); Mark 12:29 (Deuteronomy 6:4); etc.    Now Revelation 22:13. Many feel sure that this is Jesus speaking, since the one speaking tells of his "coming", and in Revelation 22:20, Jesus says: "I come quickly." And John exclaims: "Amen! Come, Lord Jesus."     This overlooks the fact that the scriptures speak of Jehovah coming, and also of Jesus coming, and that the two are closely associated.    Jehovah the God and Father of Jesus, comes to judge the world, not only with and by means of Jesus, but also the saints. -- Malachi 3:1-6; Psalm 96:13; 98:9; Daniel 7:18,22; Isaiah 40:10,11; Micah 1:3; Zechariah 14:5; Acts 17:31; 2 Peter 3:7,8; 1 Corinthians 6:2; Psalm 90:4; Jude 1:14,15; Revelation 1:1; 20:4,11-13; 22:6.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	How can jesus be god when god is god?

Why Jesus is God...but God is not Jesus??|`|AA12275506	Does the Bible say Jesus is God? Consider: Showing that Jesus was clearly no ordinary person, an angel announced in advance his conception and birth, saying: This one will be great and will be called Son of the Most High. Notice that the angel said, not God, but Son of the Most High. Luke 1:30-32.    At thirty years of age Jesus presented himself to be baptized. On that occasion Gods own voice said: This is my Son, the beloved, whom I have approved. And so John the Baptist, who witnessed the event, said of Jesus: This one is the Son of God. Matt. 3:17; John 1:34.    Jesus apostles and friends repeatedly identified him in this way. Said Nathanael: Rabbi, you are the Son of God. (John 1:49) Peter exclaimed: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. (Matt. 16:16) Martha confessed: You are the Christ, the Son of God. (John 11:27) The apostle John wrote so people might believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God. (John 20:31) And of the apostle Pauls ministry it is said: He began to preach Jesus, that this One is the Son of God. Acts 9:20.    Did Peter, Paul, John or any other of Jesus followers preach that he was God? No, from these scriptures it is clear that they taught he was Gods Son.    "Revelation 1:8.    I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, Who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty. Who is the Alpha and the Omega?     If you will notice, the Lord God and the Almighty are one in the same person. Who is the Almighty? It's Jehovah. Ex. 6:3 says: "And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty; but by my name Jehovah I was not known to them."    Jesus CAN'T be the Lord God at Rev. 1:8. Notice the wording of Luke 1:31, 32: "You will name him Jesus. He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David." As it says here, the Lord God will give Jesus "the throne of David." That should tell you that the Lord God and Jesus are two separate persons. The Lord God is the God and Father of Jesus, who is the Son of God.    "Revelation 22:13.    I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End    Now, who exactly is the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last?     At Revelation 22:12, TEV inserts the name Jesus, so the reference to Alpha and Omega in verse 13 is made to appear to apply to him. But the name Jesus does not appear there in Greek, and other translations, including the King James Bible, do not include it. Since there is only one Alpha and Omega, all references to this title apply to Jehovah.    Rev. 21:6,?7 indicates that Christians who are spiritual conquerors are to be sons of the one known as the Alpha and the Omega. That is NEVER said of the relationship of spirit-anointed Christians to Jesus Christ. Jesus spoke of them as his brothers. (Matt. 25:40)    Jesus is the Son of God. As 1 John 5:5 says: "And who can win this battle against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God."    BTW, your quote of Rev. 1:8 is NOT straight from the NWT. The NWT says: "I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Jehovah God, the One who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty."|`|d8XND5ngaa	Desert Rose makes the same point I would make.

Since they cannot explain how God can be One and yet exist in two forms, (not to mention the Holy Spirit) they then say it cannot possibly be true. In my opinion, it is a form of pride on their part to make such claims.    edit: here is another interesting verse which JW's struggle with...    Isaiah 9:6  For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.    They will say that Jesus is the "mighty God" but not the "almighty God", but I have yet to have one of them explain how there can be more than one "everlasting Father."|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	john 14:28 (jesus christ speaking):  "...

Initial evidence is of the authority kind, as in, the Bible is still used in courts and inaugurations. Most US presidents, among other leaders have staunchly believed in it.  This is not because it is unexamined and unquestioned, but because it has been questions time and time again and continues to pass the test of time.     also, historians outside the Bible from around the same time as the New Testment also claimed the same things were happening.

If  we just Evolved, how did we manage to get here to begin with. Our universe is so well balanced, that if anything was off just 2%, we wouldn't exist.That is just ONE . Then , you have the fact that The Bible is the ONLY prophetic book with a 100% track record, that means it has NEVER been wrong. true, pure science validated The Bible at every encounter, which it should since it's written in The Bible before man had a clue. Where do you think man came up with all these ideas to study out? Hmmm! Then you have the fact that NASA, using the "laws" of planetary motion, found two historical events that are recorded in history, which are ONLY recorded in The Bible. Here is another one for you, man has NEVER had an original thought. There are so many more, that is why YOU need to get into The Word.

Also, we must concern the evolusion of the bible where different gospals and testiments exit:   i. The German Monk Martin Luther (1483-1546) challanged the church and influenced Protestanism.   ii. Around 500 years back the Original Bible was destroyed in order to alter and enable the church more power and control over the people.   iii. Roman Emperor Constantine (306-337) altered the fundamentals of chirtianity for his political needs as a ruler, though he was the first in the history to accept christianity from a national perpective, ending the era of bullying the Christians.    I find similarities in holy Bible as well as the holy Quran. The major fundamental difference I notice is whether Jesus is the Son or the messier/ messenger of God.    The philosophies of Bible as well as the Quran were derived from Buddhism, where Buddhism consists of more than one philosophy to understand the reality of nature. Therefore Buddhism must be the superset.    For some, this may be hard to accept, and will find a bit controversial. My intention is to present the facts, and not to contradict with anyones believes or faith.    1. World knew Buddha (more than 2500 years ago as per written evidence) before Nassare Jesus (Son of God) and Muhammad of the Quraysh tribe (who wrote down Quran listning to God).     2. Jesus studied buddhism in an Indian Buddhist temple before preaching his own version. Same as L. Ron Hubbard preached Scientology/Dianetics after stuying a bit of Buddhism.    3. In early days, buddhist monks used to memorize the buddhas teachings Dhamma. In one occation, where a high ranking Buddhist monk memorised Dhamma  (verbally, a bit louder) inside a cave, Muhammad of the Quraysh tribe (who battled against Muslims and lost at Medina), listened from outside the cave, and was inspired by its content. As a result he documented only what he understood.    You might undertand, people tend to worship and pray for any object (including sun, trees, stones) because of fear. Muhammad, as a leader was wise and political. He presented his version of Buddhism, tactically using the God concept, where people are not allowed to question.  Please note: Buddhism (Dhamma) can be and must be questioned to undertand (Ehi Passiko)    In addition, please research yourself, the following:    Countries with the name ending with Stan meaning Place example: Afganistan, Pakistan, etc. and most arabic countries were Buddhist countries.     You might not have heard that Bangladesh was a Buddhist country, converted to Islam in one night because of weapon power.    Few years back, the tallest Buddha statue in the world, located at Afganistan was destroyed by Alkida Islamic extremists. Japanees government insisted to preserve as a historic artifact, but failed.     Buddhists are wise and tollerant. Therefore, you will not evidence wars based on religion.    If you are not born to buddhist parents (wrong way of become a buddhist), you will only accept buddhism (not as a religion), only because you are intelligent enough to understand and appreciate its deapth. There will be no promotions (eg: free stuff) to attract you.|`|CT1SqLaGaa	at the time of jesus there were two historians called tigerus and someone else i forget the name of but they wrote only fact and they mentioned jesus that he was a man who preformed miracles and lived in palestine that's all i know but i think since they could only write fact the bible in parts must be true.....|`|otEpwY5eaa	Have you seen how many contradictions there are in the Bible/God|`|jX6qoxaJaa	They don't... but they're going to ask you "what proof do you have that it is a myth".|`|UqhApIvHaa	What evidence do you have that it is not a myth?|`|zfFjKhJJaa	Testimony of those 2000 years ago that Jesus DID indeed perform miracles    Just because it is so long ago does not mean it ceases to become reality|`|SEBcylvuaa	-talking snakes and donkeys  -women being turned into pillars of salt  -the whole creationism thing  -a guy living in a whale  -two of each animal in ONE ship    yeah its definately not a myth but...fiction. no offense but these things simply CAN NOT happen!|`|f3w3x1aOaa	fullfilled prophecy, history.|`|S1tddghuaa	Well the bible is a book so it is there.   whether what is written is the truth no one completely knows.   it's a little thing called faith.  this is why we believe so much into something whether it can be proven or not.

Science: Has It Proved the Bible Wrong?    In 1613 the Italian scientist Galileo published a work known as Letters on Sunspots. In it, he presented evidence that the earth rotates around the sun, rather than the sun around the earth. By so doing, he set in motion a series of events that finally brought him before the Roman Catholic Inquisition under vehement suspicion of heresy. Eventually, he was forced to recant. Why was the idea that the earth moves around the sun viewed as heresy? Because Galileos accusers claimed that it was contrary to what the Bible says.    IT IS widely held today that the Bible is unscientific, and some point to Galileos experiences to prove it. But is this the case? When answering that question, we have to remember that the Bible is a book of prophecy, history, prayer, law, counsel, and knowledge about God. It does not claim to be a scientific textbook. Nevertheless, when the Bible does touch on scientific matters, what it says is completely accurate.    Our Planet Earth    2 Consider, for example, what the Bible says about our planet, the earth. In the book of Job, we read: [God] is stretching out the north over the empty place, hanging the earth upon nothing. (Job 26:7) Compare this with Isaiahs statement, when he says: There is One who is dwelling above the circle of the earth. (Isaiah 40:22) The picture conveyed of a round earth hanging upon nothing in the empty place reminds us strongly of the photographs taken by astronauts of the sphere of the earth floating in empty space.    3 Consider, too, the earths amazing water cycle. Here is how Comptons Encyclopedia describes what happens: Water .?.?. evaporates from the surface of the oceans into the atmosphere .?.?. Steadily moving air currents in the earths atmosphere carry the moist air inland. When the air cools, the vapor condenses to form water droplets. These are seen most commonly as clouds. Often the droplets come together to form raindrops. If the atmosphere is cold enough, snowflakes form instead of raindrops. In either case, water that has traveled from an ocean hundreds or even thousands of miles away falls to the earths surface. There it gathers into streams or soaks into the ground and begins its journey back to the sea.1    4 This remarkable process, which makes life on dry land possible, was well described about 3,000 years ago in simple, straightforward terms in the Bible: All streams run into the sea, yet the sea never overflows; back to the place from which the streams ran they return to run again.Ecclesiastes 1:7, The New English Bible.    5 Perhaps even more remarkable is the Bibles insight into the history of mountains. Here is what a textbook on geology says: From Pre-Cambrian times down to the present, the perpetual process of building and destroying mountains has continued. .?.?. Not only have mountains originated from the bottom of vanished seas, but they have often been submerged long after their formation, and then re-elevated.2 Compare this with the poetic language of the psalmist: With a watery deep just like a garment you covered [the earth]. The waters were standing above the very mountains. Mountains proceeded to ascend, valley plains proceeded to descendto the place that you have founded for them.Psalm 104:6,?8.    In the Beginning    6 The very first verse of the Bible states: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. (Genesis 1:1) Observations have led scientists to theorize that the material universe did indeed have a beginning. It has not existed for all time. Astronomer Robert Jastrow, an agnostic in religious matters, wrote: The details differ, but the essential elements in the astronomical and biblical accounts of Genesis are the same: the chain of events leading to man commenced suddenly and sharply at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy.3    7 True, many scientists, while believing that the universe had a beginning, do not accept the statement that God created. Nevertheless, some now admit that it is difficult to ignore the evidence of some kind of intelligence behind everything. Physics professor Freeman Dyson comments: The more I examine the universe and study the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe in some sense must have known that we were coming.    8 Dyson goes on to admit: Being a scientist, trained in the habits of thought and language of the twentieth century rather than the eighteenth, I do not claim that the architecture of the universe proves the existence of God. I claim only that the architecture of the universe is consistent with the hypothesis that mind plays an essential role in its functioning.4 His comment certainly betrays the skeptical attitude of our time. But putting that skepticism aside, one notes there is a remarkable harmony between modern science and the Bibles statement that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.Genesis 1:1.    Health and Sanitation    9 Consider the Bibles coverage of another field: health and sanitation. If an Israelite had a skin blemish suspected of being leprosy, he was put in isolation. All the days that the plague is in him he will be unclean. He is unclean. He should dwell isolated. Outside the camp is his dwelling place. (Leviticus 13:46) Even infected garments were burned. (Leviticus 13:52) In those days, this was an effective way of preventing the spread of the infection.    10 Another important law had to do with the disposal of human excrement, which had to be buried outside the camp. (Deuteronomy 23:12,?13) This law no doubt saved Israel from many sicknesses. Even today, severe health problems are caused in some lands by the improper disposal of human wastes. If people in those lands would onl|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Its not a myth. It is the inspired Word of God .

I ask this because I'm surprised at how few people bother to look.  In fact, the Bible is a tremendously accurate historical document.  Archaeology has demonstrated time and time again that the content of both the Old and New Testaments can be trusted.  In fact, no bit of archaeology has ever proven the Bible wrong.    We don't have a problem trusting the contents of other books of antiquity, like Plato's Republic.  Yet the copies of the books of the Bible we have are all closer (in time) to the originals than other books of antiquity, and there are far more copies and fragments of copies to attest to the fact that the contents were not somehow changed over time.    In short, you can't reject the historicity of the Bible and still be considered to be rational.  It's scientifically validated.      The question you have to answer for yourself is whether or not you believe what it contains ... that's up to you.  No science can validate or reject the proposition that Jesus paid for your sin; you have to decide this for yourself.

The only way one can know the Bible without the appearant contradictions is for one to lean it for themselves, by reading it themselves to allow the Holy Spirit to teach them the truth.    You cannot follow someone who teaches contradictions (or false teachings) & understand the Bible.  & since anyone can see there are so many different Christian Churches & different teachings... it is impossible that they all have the 100% truth... & that which is false or misunderstood cannot line up with truth 100%... therefore, you have the appearant contradictions.

Its all slight of hand and misdirection, just like God.  hey I see a theme developing....|`|U81o09nHaa	Not from gods. They abhor magic because, in fairy tales, it's available to mortals to create.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	So do you honestly think that instead of helping suffering people and answering prayers god is helping out David Blaine or something?  Magic is an illusion.  Even if god was real, I would sincerely hope that he has bettering things to do.|`|MkQWnA22aa	Magic is a natural force, it is the energy of the cosmos and of the universe.  You don't have to believe in God, necessarily, to believe in magic. Many practicioners of religions that believe in magic, such as Paganism, are actually agnostic. Our "Gods" are also different than the Christian conception.|`|WoEsehoRaa	Magic is an illusion. God performs miracles.|`|ZnZVp8ttaa	bingo! yahtzee!  you sir, are a genius!|`|suEP8YkFaa	is David Copperfield religious?|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	Magic is just tricks or slight of hand.

It is not called Supernatural.  You do not know God;You experience God.Therefore one need not go for support of proof for the existence of God. You personally experience God.  So called miracles /magic are possible for anybody with the necessary training .God has more important jobs than performing a miracle to prove himself as he is impervious to these attributes.|`|ypqoFDSqaa	Love. Its all about believing in love and find that Special someone.|`|pO8OzblHaa	Magic is the same thing that God is. Either an illusion, or your mind playing tricks on you.|`|AA11640108	I do not see the correlation.|`|lQGwzBoJaa	Magic isn't real. Sleight of hand and misdirection are though.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	It comes from fairy dust (and David Copperfield/Blaine farts), where the heck did you think it came from?|`|aBHY2iXraa	I hate that sort of thinking: Something cannot be explained, therefore God exists !!!|`|xsZfN0JHaa	With the perception of the eys and thinking of the mind we perceive things as magic. If we don't understand what we just seen, we say it is magic or magical! If we don't see God , we say he is magical!  It is up to our own way of thinking that we define what is magic and the exist of God.|`|jW0VqZcOaa	exactly.          God=magic=nonsense|`|rGEZup0Zaa	You're right; David Copperfield is proof that God exists.    Or at least Satan; that guy had to strike a deal with someone.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Magic does not come from God. It is just an illusion and is not real.|`|sKMAuY8eaa	so you are proving god with criss angel.... you really want to take that route?|`|OZAxA6J5aa	Can I believe in God but not in magic?? Because that's what I believe. I've never seen magic, okay, I've never seen God. But magic didn't write a long love note to its creation.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	yes very clever allusions are the basis of magic. did you think when Criss Angel walks on water it wasn't a trick . come on now.|`|CNotcjbaaa	Well, God does exist, and so does magic.

And just to correct you, even tho it won't matter, atheism is not a religion...|`|d0JqmXjKaa	I'm a Christian. I follow the teachings of Christ. If I live my life according to these guidelines and I die and there is no afterlife, I've still lived a good life on this earth. I've been comforted by the belief that a higher power loves me and looks out for me and I've hopefully made a few other people's lives easier.  If, however, you live this life by your belief that religion is a joke and there is no afterlife and you die and are wrong???|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	think positive if you fight it like that you only feed the fire . Answer is No.|`|AA11640108	Not if you value the adherents of said religions.  You might hurt their feelings.    What is the purpose of religion?  To give people hope?  Laughing at that which gives people hope is impolite at best.|`|eUXe2wtWaa	No. I'm an Atheist and religion, any religion, should not be ridiculed. If a person has a particular belief that is their right. Religion, or lack of, is great for debating, contempt and scorn is a sign of ignorance.|`|0vmQNf0oaa	Atheism should be. It is a silly yet perverse and destructive religion.|`|TMb076n6aa	He who has the the (last laugh) will laugh.  Nothing new under the sun it all has been done before. God is not suprized should I be?    Where will you wind up in the end?|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Definitely.|`|YAoSgET5aa	you mean a belief in gods, oh yea... and it should be laughed at with a cold budweiser in one hand, and some hot nachos in the other.|`|84nXWNT3aa	Depends on the religion.    But to most, no, that'd be a bit too harsh.    Mocking would be the milder choice.|`|GgB6bLhTaa	Sure if you want to do so privately.  But if you step back and think about how stupid and generally vile human beings are...it is really a necessary tool to keep most people fairly decent.    But personally, I don't need organized religion to have spiritual beliefs and morals.  For the masses however, I think they need it.  It is the only thing that keeps them accountable.|`|47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	Most if not all. Those that believe that they hold a unique path to God especially. Religions such as that have nothing but scorn for the likes of me in my beliefs. "Fool" is a word they like to use. Why should I hold them in any less?|`|AA12257580	Yes. It's 2009 and it's time that we start treating religion for what it is - a product of humanity's infancy.|`|czf6uhIraa	Some of them, yes.  *cough*Scientology*cough*|`|AA11466759	Everything else is.  It doesn't feel so you when you're the target though.  Kind of reminds me of playground bullies.|`|7J1D1IyRaa	When you do that, religion grows.|`|I0aosHnuaa	yes ... damned right ... detest is not strong enough a word to accurately describe my opinion of religion ...|`|3K51tgQWaa	What did you think Scientology was for.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	It HAS been!!

81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	Because a tree bears multiple fruits. A tree is an expression of a system that grows from a single seed. This system is a movement of a certain type of energy or for these terms a certain type of word. At some point this branches off into two halves -- duality. What is being expressed is that good and evil are of the same tree -- without the evil the tree could not be of knowledge and vice versa. They, within this system, depends on another to be.    So thus the eating thereof in regards the polarities of male and female, is to feed upon the fruit of division - the fruit of separation which causes struggle because it gives the capacity to truly develop each part and bring about a wholeness. Hence it was said after eating the fruits of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, because of this now they can take of the tree of life and become as Gods live forever. The tree of life is the complete reality of the tree knowledge of good and evil. Is there any reason why after eating this mankind was to live by the sweat of his brow? This refers to great struggle to overcome the division within us.|`|6AT498UTaa	So you don't have to ask why a container of knowledge..why not a tree of knowledge?|`|860c6e6cbb0a45ed8571556722c3f97aaa	Waite and ask God, how are we suppose to know!|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Because all your suggestions are anthropogenic creations.  Humans like to think that there is a source of knowledge outside of themselves.  It may also have its roots (pun intended) in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic creation myth with the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.      To the answerer above me: The earth is circular because it was formed by gravity pulling together clumps of floating rock.  As the planet grew larger and pulled more to it, it developed a stronger gravitational pull that forced things as close as possible to its center.  This, obviously, forms a largely spherical shape.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Obey the tree!|`|AA12257580	That would've been too technological for ancient Hebrew scribes.     Ancient Hebrew scribes who plagiarized Egyptian and Babylonian mythology to compose almost the entire Pentateuch.|`|czf6uhIraa	...crate of knowledge, jar of knowledge, envelope of knowledge...|`|bl0RZJrDaa	because trees are weird|`|f9d6dae3f1ae09d41fda165355bd8e17aa	bECAUSE IT HAS ROOTS, BRANCHES AND LEAVES AND IT IS A LIVING THING.|`|I71x2a8eaa	I always fancied a dandelion of knowledge, myself.|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	Why the earth is spherical instead of cubed, or flat or triangular???|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	because a tree is a long living thing..haha i don't know how to put it..  a tree has gone through many events in life...|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	knowledge is feared by kings and religious powers who wish to keep control power and money through their agenda.but remember a little bit of knowledge is a danger to be reckoned with.|`|suEP8YkFaa	i'd rather see a whip of thorns...|`|KhJwOurLaa	All we know is many religious people absolutely refuse to eat from it.
IVy35SE2aa	that is like asking if you have stopped beating your wife.  God knows hell is a myth and that all mankind will  eventually get over their foolish beliefs and rejoin Him.|`|kzkU2WGzaa	This is a hard question. It depends on your perspective of hell. I think hardly anyone actually goes to hell.   We all had a great idea of what to expect when coming to live on Earth. We to come live life and learn for ourselves.  Just like we have to grow up & leave home to live our own lives. We also had to leave God and he loves to help us if we just just let him.
AA12357988	Make sure you don't have anything in your teeth.|`|AA11199456	I read in a psychology book that a face tends to soften when they see something pleasing. If someone likes you, I would guess they would stare with a pleasant expression as if they're happy. Of course, it can't apply for everyone since some people are different. I, for example, doubt I look happy when I look at someone I'm romantically interested in. I probably look more scared or serious because I feel anxious and nervous around them.
OTnSwNwZaa	Depends on who you are around.    I know people that spell words like that and they are not gangster at all (preppy asian girls to be honest).    I also know plenty of intelligent nerd-types that use 13375p34|    Also, if you are implying that most gangsters are Black, why should they try to impress people that will never have a good impression of them no matter what?|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	Their brain can not handle the stress of a real life.|`|jj9G0BBraa	Wut'choo tallkin bout?

Who cares how people see generations of people anyway. Do you even know what generation you are a part of? I don't. If you do not want to speak that way, then don't. Stop trying to force your beliefs on everyone else. We could all care less about your opinions on anything.
VpOGcG4maa	Thanks for the information.   I looked at the website and it does sound like something I would like to see.

Try going a little deeper than Rush for your news.|`|NCRfZRopaa	He has only been the president for less than a month. He has done some sweeping changes from the Bush admin. Let's wait a bit longer to see what else he will do.    For me, the change that Obama brought and still brings is a good one.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	Good grief, the man have been in office for a bloody week. He can't turn the whole country around in that period of time.

Faith in man brings nothing but destruction.|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	The only thing Bush baited us with is better leadership than Al Gore and John Kerry and he delivered.  (of coarse we couldve got that from a paper bag bUUt anyway)    We are promised everything by the democrats.  Name one thing they havent promised including world peace!  But it doesnt matter because THEYRE SO COMPASSIONATE AND SMART.|`|ucuP0boCaa	You voted for a person with a loooong history of incompetence. If you weren't concerned about what happens to this country then why are you concerned now?  Obama has played his hand so well that none of us can credibly question whatever he does. I didn't llike the Rahm appointment. But then I can't play the game as well as Obama.    Obama is going to prove to you that he will go down in history as one of the best presidents we have ever had.|`|OZAxA6J5aa	I like how he promised change all during his campaign and as soon as he won he started backpedaling saying how change will take time. If he gets elected for a second term, his slogan will be: I just need more time and then I'll start the change.  Yeah, this will be exactly like when Bush was in office. The government will waste time and money while the important issues are only talked about in endless circles. (Did you hear Congress is voting to push back the TV switch to June and Obama supports this? They are wasting time talking about TV while our country is at war and our economy is floundering!! Gah!)

3GAiVmEAaa	I don't know any celebrities so I am not about to make an assumption about all of them.    And in some cases, does it matter?

Nah, I'll give some kudos to Angelina on this one.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	I think that the ones who gloat about it in front of the cameras only do it for publicity... however i do believe that some of the celebrities use their position to bring awareness to different causes.

Being rich means that you can afford to pay to hide your flaws and have artist who can make you into a person that you thought did not exist.   Spiritually speaking rich again. Being rich in God's Grace comes in many forms. Being rich money wise gives more of an opportunity to learn how to speak in front of others, and for the most part when one is dressed well again with the right make up and hair, it gives one sometimes a false sense of security. BUT that false sense of security is what will get you in front of a crowd and witness to others, or be able to sing, pray and just be plain ole you.   Now being rich without a sense of responsibility towards the value of the dollar and without God in your life can also make you the poorest person in the world while you are counting every dollar that you have.|`|JseyoIfLaa	Rich is sexy!|`|dFBccLExaa	Rich.

IjMHcECzaa	Hey, I'm from hong kong too, and I know it's hard for gays to live here... I'm sorry your family does not like gays, my gay friends are the same as you.    answer 1) Move out!!! Yes. You should live on your own. It is your freedom    answer 2) I think they are bitches, they may be family but that does not mean they can hurt you    answer 3) Move out, ignore your family, make new friends. Go to the gay club in hong kong and find some people just like you    answer 4) Yes it is normal. :)    Answer 5) Yes, you're 20 years old! YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!    email me if you want to talk ^^    GA YOW lol|`|Cpr6Ff5laa	1- no, finish your studies first, you can ignore your family    2- i think your sister and parents are horrible people, and you shouldn't even consider them family for not accepting who you are and who you have been    3- to be sad now, you had to have been happy about something else before    4- move from hong kong imo if you can there are a lot of better places, money wise, job wise, and most importantly, tolerance wise    5- yes it's okay to do it, try to share a room with one of your friends or multiple friends, but get out of that gay-bashing house ASAP, they make you feel bad, and i can tell that that kind of stress will be interfering with your studies and life and it's bad for you.|`|wyC6Qa4Raa	1. Yes get out of the house. Get a full time job and and do your studies part time. You can't be under stress going to school and coming home to a house that treats you badly.    2.If your sister is going to be a counsellor she needs some serious education in social work. She has some very distorted opinion working with diversity.  Your Parents need to be told that they are being emotionally abusive and remind your sister what emotional abuse is all about and she should educate herself what emotional abuse is. She is also part of the problem.    3. I don't know if Hong Kong has a gay alliance group. Hopefully you can find a organization in the area that is gay positive that give support for gay students.  Do an on-line in your area to find gay organization.    4. It can be very difficult to live in an emotionally abusive home and it is for the best to live the environment to save yourself. It can wear you done emotionally, mentally and spiritually.    5.Closing your room door is normal for your own privacy. You need privacy to air out your emotional frustration.     Lastly, your parents and sister need to learn to accept you and not demand you to be straight in order to  gain their love and acceptance. This is not normal. They need to love you for who you are. If they can't do that, then you need to remove yourself away from this toxic enivornment.  Iam so sorrry you are experience so much pain. My heart goes out to you. Know yyou are not alone.
JI7NQ9TNaa	Actually calling someone an idiot gets your reported.    But man I get tired of the endless "poop" and fart questions.  And the sneaky sleazy sex questions.    This could be a real resource, were it not for the adolescents of all ages who think its a hoot to post a non-question.    Just my opinion, of course.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	I know, it's awful.  These are the same "trolls" that go around reporting people for any reason or no reason at all.  They have nothing better to do and are very unhappy in life.|`|fMLBPUVeaa	i think it's because people just want to put other people down without getting called off for it. they're lame, i know.|`|Xnh2tmQlaa	Because there are few consequences.  No one is going to punch you in the face if you say something rude and most people have no manners.  The worst thing that might happen is they might delete you and give you a violation.  (go in the corner now, time out BAD DOG, BAD, BAD DOG!)|`|mRun89yLaa	Because its' FUN!!!  Geez, welcome to the internet! the abuse you will receive here is nothing compared to what you will get on other sites.|`|FPONPOlHaa	because some people have to be dirty little pigs about everyting. no wonder why America is like it is because people are rude selfish liers|`|FCKdRZd1aa	to avatar "ehh" you would know......|`|4m3z1ztEaa	because they are a bunch of losers who are unsuccessful in real life and could only find immature joy when insulting people   also a kind of cowardice since they cannot do it face to face

Strangely enough, most people aren't bothered by such a question...|`|8fp5dSW4aa	If anything, my life hasn't felt better not worrying about what a man in the sky watching my every move|`|okH04Nhlaa	Living your life as a good person is definately not enough. Of course, it's alwas good to do that, but you really need to be saved if you want your spot in heaven.|`|UDXp2d8Zaa	1corinthians 15:19  If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	"Following God's will" is not how you get saved.  Nobody will be saved that way.     Salvation is only by believing in Jesus alone to save you, without adding any of your own works.     We're all sinners. Only Jesus is acceptable payment for sins, because Jesus died on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead.     All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even ONE of your sins. All the trying to be a "good person" won't pay for even ONE of your sins. Doing "religious activites" won't pay for even ONE of your sins.     Either Jesus pays for your sins, or you pay for them in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before you.    So believe in Jesus as God and Savior, and you're saved, that simple (John 3:16). :)|`|TMb076n6aa	No our righteousnes is filthy rags before God we can never be good enough this is why Jesus died fro us. Ask Him to help you with your unbelief.|`|bJt3fFnraa	It will change your life completely--to a better one.|`|kHv0CuaMaa	So they can save their *** and get into heaven. That is the only reason. It's rather selfish if you think about it.|`|AA11287948	You'd think living in the United States (i'm assuming) or any other capitalistic and democratic society that you'd understand that anything worthwhile isn't just given to you on a silver platter.  In the case of eternal life, why in the world do you expect it to just be given to you?  Just like anything, a good job, love, other things that make life good, you  have to work at it and do certain things. Just like in order to be a doctor, which provides you with wealth and societal respect, you have to go through years of training and academic success, in order to achieve eternal happiness, you have to abide by certain rules and pathways.|`|mA6ef2LNaa	Because this world is going to end someday and when you die, that is the end of your life.  If you believe in God, you will know the truth about what happens when the world ends.  If you don't believe in God you will believe every and anything that is told to you which is a lie.  This is why it is so important to believe in God because every day you wake up and have life in you.  Without Him you wouldn't exist.  Some day you are going to acknowledge that God is the reason for everyone existence and you will feel glad to know God.|`|UVkG7Ijtaa	Imam Ali said: " work for your life as if you were to live forever, and work for your after life as if you were to die tomorrow.:    Yes it is important to live a good life and be a good person.However, non of us will live forever. As such, we need to plan for the hereafter.  That is why you need to think and ponder upon few questions:  why was I created? who created me? where do we go once we die?    This life is only short lived and is a passage way to the eternal life.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	The Christian idea, I think, is not about behavior at all.  The Christian view is that behavior naturally flows from "being" and that who we are is far more important than how we act.    God proposes that we become His sons and daughters.  He is offering a personal relationship with our Creator.  To accept His offer, we have to seek after Him and that requires that we accept that He exists, i.e. believe in Him.    To not believe in Him is the same as rejecting His offer to become part of His family.  To say that we are good without God is to say that we don't want Him and don't need Him.  Eventually God will let us have that which we truly want.  If it is independence from Him, so be it.

That kills me when people say that. it's like do they think light skinned people are the only ones who can be attractive.    Honestly, all light skinned people are not attractive and I see beautiful dark skinned people on the regular.|`|StRaKUf6aa	I thought I told you to stop listening to Sarge...lol.      Honestly, he's one person.  Sure there are a million more like him.  Who cares?  Let them think what they will.  I'm not dark-skinned but I'm far from light-skinned (us underrepresented in-betweeners...lol) and I've never been told I was hot for a brown-skinned girl but I can tell that's what a lot of men are thinking when they look at me.  They have to do a double take like "Wow, I can't believe that girl is black!"  Yeah I may be thinking too hard but that's what it seems like sometimes.      Most people in general don't expect blacks to be very attractive because most people have a standard of beauty that blacks can never hope to live up to (light skin, straight hair, small bone structure, slight stature).  Sure there are plenty of black women who are skinny and small and there are some who also have light skin and straight hair, there are tons who are just light-skinned as well.      A lot of black men (not saying most or all) fall for this same standard of beauty sometimes and they take to insulting dark-skinned black women because they aren't what the media says is attractive.    I personally find dark-skinned (darker than me) women to be leagues more attractive than light-skinned women because there's something special about them that's difficult to find in others.  I don't know if it's the smooth skin or what but there's no competition for dark-skinned black women in my eyes.|`|OTnSwNwZaa	Nope. To be honest, I've found darker-skinned women to have more attractive facial features than light-skinned women.    Black is certainly not the worldwide standard of beauty though, and the closer you are to white, the better (especially int he eyes of non-Blacks). Sad but true. I will say that I personally respect darker-skinned women (although I'm attracted to Japanese women hehe, I won't knock you).|`|azKH25wZaa	Beauty is more than skin color...hair type...eye-shape...or nose width. You are not your physical being, but your spiritual. You are your soul. And if you are happy within...it will show through your physical self. That to me, is true Beauty.|`|ckVewstIaa	i watched the same thing yesterday and i would have to say he has a color complex issue. he's making light skin girls the victim and saying that basically all dark females piclk on light ones and envy them...he also say thar all biracial women are more attractive. so fuc his opinion its all based on slave mentality and stereotypes.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	anyone who thinks darker skin is unattractive is completely nuts out of their mind and falls to easily into America's Eurocentric idea of "beauty".    I don't want to listen to him, but I think he is stupid, anyone who thinks the color of someone's skin determines how they dress or carry themselves is stupid.|`|2a0e5d5b94219fa3def0dbdc7b21005daa	becuase we were taught that the closer you are to white, the better you are/look  plus look at the media|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	Sorry to say but, i do not find colored women attractive.  I am not racists.|`|YlMR42agaa	You want me to listen to srg wilie pete? haah omg are you kidding me?  you listen to that douche bag. Megan good is brown skinned or it can be dark brown skin and she is stunning. Yes dark skin is wonderful. btw there is no difference between a dark black woman or a brown or a light skinned one....just skin that's it  but besides that we are all the same|`|88fHI3xDaa	u are much attractive and i want to marry u but ur picture is boring because it is immodest|`|U5zcbHuZaa	I'm a white guy. Before I revereted to Islam, I was allowed to look at women just to admire their beauty. There are so many beautiful women in this world -- so, so many -- and there is such great diversity within that beauty. I remember back to my college days, a short dark-skin black woman whom I did not know that I used to see in one of my big lecture classes, she was gorgeous. I had to work not to stare at her. I never approached her, I was way too shy, so I just admired her from afar.|`|mxixfE3Raa	I think it depends on the person.  I think darker skinned women seem to have more prominant facial features like high cheek bones, personally i'd love to have high cheek bones, and I think girls are lucky to have it, but it kind of depends on the girl.    I can think of more good looking light skinned girls than dark skinned, but then I don't know many darker skinned black women, but I see some on the street who are gorgeous.|`|qKkTI0jnaa	I agree w/ everything Qwerty said.|`|SEBcylvuaa	in any society men are expected to be darker skinned and women to be lighter skinned. so yeah to some degree guys do expect girls who are darker than them to be not as attractive as those that are lighter.    besides Im sure most black guys arent into girls who are pale with no melanin in their skin at all so its not that "they want the eurocentric standard of beauty" but simply just someone lighter than them.    trust me white people arent getting tans for protection against the sun.    I will be the 1st to say that there are a lot of different features that different races have that are very attractive and some that aren't. but so far there isn't one person that has every single most wanted characteristc found in every race    To me the ultimate gorgeous girl would have    -blue eye color but with the shape of asian eyes as opposed to the round eyes. (most people with blue eyes are white, most with wide shaped eyes are asian)  -a tan(white people are usually the only ones without it although I know there are some asians who have white skin)  -an hourglass figure as in wide hips, small waist(more common among blacks, puerto ricans, dominicans, and some middle eastern womenbut extremely rare among whites and asians)  -naturally big butts AND big boobs(mostly found among women who are again, black, PR, domin, etc. but usually they have one or the other but rarely both. kim kardashian has both naturally)  -and long brunette hair    so so far I can't think of any female with blue almond shaped eyes, a tan as opposed to pale skin, a voluptuous hourglass figure, and fairly big boobs and butt.    kim kardashian has everything listed except for blue wide shaped eyes, hers are round and brown.   beyonce and jlo have voluptuous figures, but their butts are bigger than their boobs    so honestly every race has its set of features that are beautiful but it would take someone who is mixed with virtually every race to have the most beautiful characteristics in each. Im saying this because I think everybody knows that these are the most desired things.     I mean who doesnt like blue eyes? who doesnt like a tan? who doesnt like boobs and a butt? and who doesnt like the hourglass figure? but there is not one person that has all these things naturally. so yeah Im just pointing out how the "eurocentric standard of beauty" has its flaws. the people who fit that standard may have amazing eyes and long hair and all, but they are far from voluptuous and usually too pale|`|Qy8lAhDVaa	I think they are ignorant,Foxy Brown & Kenya Moore for example is very beautiful & looks way better than Beyonce any day.|`|nE15oNjBaa	I am not a man, but no i don't expect all darker women    to be unattractive.

I'm not partial to skin color, but definitely the darker you are more often then not the more unattractive you are.|`|7a15c276d2782ca7df8dc93ccf72655caa	Foxy Brown is pretty, but her attitude is ugly.  Alot of men think this way, but not all of them.

AA11217207	The above scenario has huge implications for the pro-life/pro-choice war but I will not address them as that was not the question asked.     This would be good for the LBGT community for proving that it is indeed something that is beyond your personal control and is preset from a young age.     This would be bad for the LBGT community since people will not abandon their unprecedented hate that easily. If it was genetic someone might feel straight couples must be tested for the chance they might have gay babies before they can get married. Facilities and people focused on "correcting"  homosexuality might increase their focus on physical torture rather then psychological.     It could make "coming out of the closet" a non issue. If people know already for sure though it might become a listed integer on personal identification. You wouldn't have to worry about your child being influenced by gay children. The gay children can now be isolated from the "normal and decent" kids.     The world seems to be moving toward being more accepting understanding and equal so I would anticipate if it was proven to be determined genetically the positive would be widespread while the negative would be small or nonexistent. I have seen the depth of hate enough times that I would not rule out the negative as impossible though.|`|d8ox561maa	No it would not hurt LGBT. In actual fact, it brings public awareness to the genetic moral issues that the society has to face with the advances in the technology. It needs to have new laws so people would not kill off their child because he is potentially homosexual. What if the analysis was wrong? It is still a human being that we are talking about. The movie Gattaca has brought similar issue regarding genetic discrimination. So good on Law and Order to bring it up so people will be aware of the very real issue.|`|nisfxpXHaa	I suppose the population at large doesn't pay as much attention to this area of scientific research as the LGBT community. So this may honestly be a new piece of information for many.     I also don't  think that most people sit around and worry about the orientation of their unborn child.    That being said I am sure that one day scientist will 100% find the gene or genes responsible for orientation and some couples will opt to design a child without those markers.     I don't for see most couples absorbing the cost to design a child. This will be financially out of most peoples reach. The real worry, would be if an inexpensive test were created, that could test for these markers and parents then could make a choice as too whether or not they wanted to abort the fetus.     I think it could help as much as it hurts, some will point to that as proof that people are born gay. Others will want it used to find a cure.    I guess I'm sitting on the fence on this one.      L|`|aaQUMXUzaa	I don't know if it helps or hurts, maybe a little of both. I think everyone should live the lifestyle they were born to live. I believe it's absurd for some to say it's a choice.|`|MoidAgwuaa	Law and Order has always been one of my favorite shows, because it deals with tough issues and highlights social justice. I would say it can only help. This episode might make people think about whether or not homosexuality is really a choice or if it is a person's genetic destiny, and analyze discrimination against gay people, perhaps comparing it to racism. I think it's great the show touched on that topic.|`|BWLbd8qdaa	If its fact then it can't hurt us, however if its a work of fiction then it can harm us.|`|LF6Ox2k2aa	Its a sad fact that if this is true then many babies will be terminated.  Many people who carry this gene will be discriminated against.  I can imagine Health insurance suddenly becoming very expensive if you carry that gene.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	I think it's mixed. Publicity is good, even if in a bad context, but I'm leary of attempts to legitimate our genders and loves with biologically rooted arguments. Feels too medical, and could lead to a renewed pathologizing and various "treatments" that actually work better than the reparatative therapy crap also used on pedosexuals and people with destructive fetishes. Basically, if there's a certain few genes, fine, but our acceptance on our terms should not hinge upon that. Even if we are queer by choice, I really fail to see why it should matter. Point is, there are people who've collectively bonded together and formed movements around their identities, and whether culture alone, or biology too, led us to unite, we're here.    UPDATE:  Brought up a good point, Melbourne. If we develop a test, what's to stop reactionary doctors and repressive states from using it to determine whether a fetus lives. Some things are better unexplored.|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	I think that any positive exposure that helps people get used to the idea is good. Also, giving people a reason other than the same "lifestyle choice" b.s. is good. However, as scientific information will help in gaining tolerance from intelligent people, the uneducated people who are the ones who cause the problems anyway won't believe it, so it does nothing for them. I can't see how it would be bad though.

gtJ3QLwLaa	In this sentence, shy means less or short.  She left a few credits short of graduating.     =)|`|uWjkYMQpaa	Yup, first answerer is correct.

SEBcylvuaa	the world is overpopulated. you should be happy that there are men like us who dont want to populate the world anymore.    even by religious terms. god only told people to populate and stuff when the world was UNDERpopulated. im sure now he would understand if people chose not to have kids|`|5fKnal6Haa	Men who doesn't want kids are *********. Kids are angels. Why doesn't some f r e a k i n g men want kids? It's gonna be a sin if a person, weather a men or a women doesn't want a kid even though they can have one. Its not a sin if a person wants to have a kid but because they have some problem they can't have a kid.|`|M4ZGDSfIaa	No, I do not believe so, that's just their choice.

Why would you call someone you disagree with a "fa**ot"? That is so juvenile and stupid.    There's nothing wrong with men who never want kids as long as they don't go around having unprotected sex and leaving fatherless children behind. If a man never wants kids he should man up and have a vasectomy.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	Because there kids are the Xbox and there Mercedes so we don't want any more kids|`|LVe6MJfMaa	No, some people truly don't want their genes to be passed on...|`|thVN9X2Baa	I must be loser too.

Kids are not for everybody.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	I think a person who wants sex and marriage but can't understand the job of making and raising a kid is either immature or selfish.  But the way you say it, this gay man doesn't want kids.  Perhaps because he doesn't want to be one of those gay couples adopting or hiring a surrogate mother to get a child.    I'm happy that men who don't want kids don't get kids, as long as it means that they never ever have offspring, not even at a sperm bank, or with a woman he will never see.  They can get fixed if they don't want kids.|`|p5aZtaiwaa	In tradition men love to populate but if u have that, "uhhh" factor then it's okay|`|CuhJRewLaa	id say its pretty normal to not want kids    they limit your choices of what you can do in life very much|`|pC1rRb9Oaa	no.

HsT9sW5Xaa	As SOCIAL creatures, it is natural for us to be concerned about what others think about us. Anyone who claims "I don't care about what anyone thinks of me", clearly does care because otherwise they wouldn't try to convince others to share that opinion. However, this doesn't mean our entire self-image and self esteem should be focused upon the perceptions of others on us.   People who obsess and overly worry about others opinions are insecure about themselves, and have low self esteem. If your opinion of yourself is strong enough, you will not care as much about others opinion BUT you will still care, regardless of what claim.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	Because they are not happy with themselves !|`|dqxW1W0eaa	I ain't.............!
EHAGMKX1aa	Eh, depends on who you ask.  The Mormons say most of us can get into heaven (Jesus said so, by the way) and most other Christians tend to think "God will take care of us" (their family and other loved ones) -- no matter how much the poop may hit the universal fan.    Oh, sure, some Christian's kids may turn out atheist or Buddhist and end up perpetually scalding according to their beliefs but, really, I get the feeling a lot of parents think their kids'll get a free pass if they just avoid killing people.  In fact, ask a parent who's just given birth about whether their kid is going to hell.  If you don't get cussed out, thrown out or beat up, you'll likely hear: "How could Heaven turn this darling little face away?"     And, ya know, even if the kid was unexpected, pretty much every parent I know has this idea (perhaps unconscious in some cases though always clearly stated in one way or another) that their kids are gonna have a life very similar to their own -- if not, of course, better:    They're going to play baseball in the backyard, experience that first lesson-learned hangover in college with the friends they'll keep for a lifetime, they'll find their true love, make babies, get that big house in the valley, ride their bike every morning before heading into the office, and then retire in some sunny locale.    And maybe they will.  But who says?  How many atom bombs we got out there?  What was the worldwide military death-count last year for whoever you feel were "the good guys?"  What was the divorce rate?  Ever heard of the Menendez brothers?  Ted Bundy?  Anyone American remember 9/11?    I mean, really.  Drunk drivers, financial collapse, viral pandemics, mental illness.  Molestation, runaways, near-rampant diabetes, meth-heads, cancer.  Blindness, rape, biological warfare, high blood pressure, disability, economic depression, scarcity of natural resources through destruction and/or overpopulation.    Man!  There's plenty enough potential Hell-on-Earth -- to hell with worrying about any potential hell in an afterlife!  But all that stuff -- that always seems to be something that can happen to OTHER people's kids.    Ah, but, really, what's the harm in thinking positive?  Whether it's your kid's future or your own.  Sit around waiting for the atom bomb is just gonna cause high blood pressure.  Staying off the roads won't necessarily keep your life untouched by a drunk driver.  Rape can occur even with all the doors locked.    And financial disaster -- personal, global or in between -- can potentially be a blessing.  What a way to see what you're made of, to recognize what's most important, gain greater empathy by standing in "the other guy's shoes," strengthen your courage, and perhaps really knock yourself awake from the highway-hypnosis often found on the adult's road of life?  Hardship and challenge can, of course, sometimes be a blessing or a curse based solely on your viewpoint.    Ah, but that's another discussion.  Back to your question:    Personally, I think the greater irresponsiblity in our species producing so much of itself isn't whether our kids will end up in hell, become disabled or destitute -- it's related to that last hell-on-earth example:  overpopulation.    Sometimes I think: "God may have said to go forth and multiply, but that was a helluva long time ago!  I think we did that job.  Quite well.  TOO well.  Time to clock out, folks.  At least slow down!  I mean who's gonna be payin' for this overtime?  I can tell ya:  Your kids.  Your darling little faces.  And few will see it comin' while on the fertility drugs or pushing a stroller."    But, then, hey -- maybe God will save all our arses!  Or we'll end up on an economic upswing that never dips again!  Obama will convince the world to destroy their nuclear weapons and the cures for diabetes, cancer and blindness will appear within the decade!    Yeah, that'd be nice.  But don't bet your kids on it.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	"no solid basis for what lies ahead".    Well, you've just summed up every belief about an afterlife.|`|AA11703549	I think that's a loose argument. In the long run, you're saying that people shouldn't exist because there's a theoretical chance of suffering in the end, depending on what you believe.   I don't really think nonexistence is an answer to anything.|`|5dd8eBDYaa	Yeah, focus on death. SO inspiring.    What an odd way to live one's life.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	yes it is irresponsible to have children if you can't take care of them. that is one reason i am pro choice. do we really want every woman or teenager who gets pregnant to be entrusted with the care of a child? it didn't work out so well for kaylee anthony did it?|`|3GAiVmEAaa	So what, because everyone is unsure we should give up and let the human race die out?    Who cares what religion is right or wrong, or what could possibly go wrong. Lots of things can go right too!     We just need to take care of ourselves the best we can and teach our children to do the same!|`|fc711dee0348a3fa4c47b0371bd359d5aa	That's such an excellent point.  Fanatical christians are the first to complain about abortion and yet they say we are all sinners from birth.  So on one hand life is sacred, on the other the mother is going to be giving birth to evil.  And if that child is never saved, it's going straight to the pits of hell.  Imagine all those babies who wont be saved and will go to hell.  You would think they would try to spare those poor souls from coming here.  In other words.. I agree.  Great question!|`|K24JFTOcaa	liberalism main weapon is fear|`|jOwH96wKaa	If you're a christian, I guess it would be.

Sheols, hades and hell is defined as the/your grave, you do die, sleep in death.  The lake of fire means  eternal death, you will not exist no longer, never having a chance of everlasting life.  Through Christ you can have that chance.|`|g7pqKw5Qaa	your took quotes from the bible and swicthed the original context.     it was said that the way is narrow: meaning its a hard to do the will of god the way he said to and you will have obstacles but most people will go the way that looks good doing the things that's fun to the eye and not the will of jehovah.     and hell is just the common grave when adam sinned he was told from dust you are from dust you will return which is why when we die we just become dirt.      and jesus said that because he was trying to preach the news and many people ignored him so when the times come that prophesied about come true just because you know god or jesus doesn't mean you will be saved if you were not doing the will of god .

V5lxDoIRaa	Well you can tell your sister she is definitely wrong.    I am a transsexual woman and let me first tell you that a transsexual woman was born a woman in a mans body. The surgery that we have and what most people call a sex change is a Sexual Reassignment Surgery (SRS), also called a Vaginoplasty. When completed we have a beautiful vulva with a inner and outer labia, and clitoris and vagina.  Also when done by one of the major surgeons even a OB/GYN could not tell the difference from a natal woman by sight alone.    Edit:  Have your sister google Vaginalplasty.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	A male bodied person who identifies as female can get a surgery where the shaft of the penis is inverted to form a vagina.      They would not be able to reproduce in the same way as somebody who was born female might.|`|65QqZBnjaa	First, a man doesn't "become a woman".  A transsexual woman recieves treatment for her birth condition.    Second, surgery today is quite good, in most cases not even a doctor can tell I was not born the way I am today.    Yes I've been there, done that.  My vulva, vagina and clitoris fall within the normal range of what is typical for natal women.  Your sister is wrong.  I would post link to pics, but that would be in bad taste.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	Yes, a male-to-female transsexual can have surgery to create a vagina.    The procedure is called vaginoplasty.    http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/srsindex...|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	You are correct. See the link.|`|aaQUMXUzaa	yes, it's all done with the penis that makes the female parts.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Yes, the former male is given a created vagina by inverting the penis. I don;t know the details to relate to you. I think your sister is simply thinking of castration whereby the male genitalia are removed. Once upon a time this was merely to make male slaves docile, then up to about 1838, choir boys were selected by the catholic Church to be castrated so as not to loose their voices. It may be a necessity in modern times for men to undergo castration because of testicular cancer or even to prevent the growth of prostate cancer, but it is the  testicles that are surgically removed, not the penis. In the old days, it was everything. I don't know the death rate involved but it would have had to have been greater than 50%.|`|WqkFJ2Pgaa	Yes. They turn the penis inside out.|`|tNRM86lXaa	yeah they can put on a vajj but it doesnt work (periods)

There have been people posting pics of like 3 different people saying it's them, lol what?  But on the other hands, the real pictures, the girls just want compliments or an ego boost.  That's why they freak when some one tells them they are other than pretty.|`|SEBcylvuaa	actually most girls asking "am i pretty?" are rather average and far from pretty...ugly if you ask me    the REALLY pretty ones never ask because they are more confident in themselves    as for your dog. I guess yeah|`|HBRH4KBvaa	They just need an ego boost to make them feel even better.   "I'm not fishing for compliments! I promise I'm not fishing for compliments!11" - haha      Yes, you're very cute ^^ lol|`|StRaKUf6aa	Some girls are so obsessed with keeping up appearances that they devote their lives to how other people think of them.  They'll go out of their way to receive compliments (post "what race do I look like" or "this is me!" etc. etc. etc.) and when they don't, it ruins their day.    They're actually very insecure.|`|WAoNhHB1aa	The dog is ah-dorable!!!!|`|EmOnt7FIaa	tHaT d0g iS S0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o cUtE    OMG|`|nE15oNjBaa	Pretty girls have big egos that need stroking.    They tend to be more insecure than girls that  are seen as less pretty.      And green eyed Latino is wrong:    You can be pretty AND insecure.  A lot of people that i know that   are pretty don't feel that way and are   insecure...

As far as giving money,  only 10 percent of your income is ever required.      If one has no income then no $ is required.       If the church asked for money,   they are stealing  your friends blessings.       If i was your friend,  i would Run and get out of that so called church/beth aven.    Church of nothing.

HWoLbR7Aaa	I'd take Hitler back in time and show him that Jesus was a Jew.  That would blow his goddamn mind.|`|EayLdDkWaa	Get off your high horse about Hitler. He was pure evil. Sure, people have done terrible things in the name of Christianity, but Jesus HIMSELF seems to have been a nice generous guy.     John Lennon said of the Beatles, "We're bigger than Jesus right now." And he was right. Humanity loves to glorify people - from Abraham and the ancient kings to Obama and JFK. If you killed Jesus, society would just create another one to take his place.    The other day I saw this movie called The Man from Earth, about a guy with a weird but thought-provoking connection to Jesus. (Really it's more of a play on screen). It criticizes Christianity... You might be interested in it. Check it out: http://www.manfromearth.com/|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	Neither, why would I become what I despise?|`|mOMCymHnaa	Hitler, duh.|`|3bQaEVmTaa	hitler but i wudnt put jesus in this|`|fc7ee39a39d002e8d416468f94168f1faa	Are you serious?

I don't need to travel back because Hitler is already killed. Hitler killed himself and Jesus he rose up and could not stay killed.|`|IIYxx7eGaa	Don't you know if you alter history, you create a new world.  Just think even though Hitler did evil things, there were great lesson's to be learned from him.  And while he set off a war, there was so many technological jumps that were made because of the war.  Like fission for one and nuclear technology.    And if you kill Jesus, other than how it prophesied you'd erase an entire religion.  A religion that's the light of the world to many people's lives.  A religion that has helped millions of people cope with their previous wrongdoings and problems.    So I guess, my answer would be not to outright kill Jesus.  But rather to encourage Pilot and the Sanhedrin to carry out their plot.  Otherwise, you'd be creating a paradox that would hinder many lives and only delay what they're message was to the world.|`|zYAQrnjcaa	Neither. I don't have the right to kill anyone.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	Hitler, the man was evil.|`|3E6lf2cJaa	jesus would just resurrect again so that'll be a waste of time. ... ....|`|1tlgYKROaa	Hitler, definitely|`|EHAGMKX1aa	Well, more people have died in battles and such tied to Jesus (whether he truly was the "Son of God" or not -- never mind if he even existed!).  But let's just say all the Bible stories are true:    From his very birth people were kissing the ground before this holy king.  So, at what point could you kill him and avoid all the wars and murder in his name?  Whack Mary before she gets impregnated?    Okay, now, if he ISN'T the Son of God (i.e., he or someone else concocted the whole story), you know there woulda just come along some other dude that people would fall before in adoring genuflection.  Why, you'd run yourself ragged going back in time.    Because as soon as you returned to the 21st century, there'd be some other fella sewn into the tapestries -- rays of light emanating from his scalp -- as some TV preacher bangs away at the podium about the evils of Hooters girls and homosexuals.  All in the name of Our Lord and Savior, Geeb the lowly haberdasher.  Or Ralph, the loving brewmaster.  Or Shep, the lighthearted hobo.    Ah, yeah, make it easy on yourself -- go for Hitler.|`|3vmDRCTCaa	If I could go back in time, I'd just kill the first people so none of this would've happened. By the way, to the people who said they'd kill Jesus: He would just rise again. How else are you going to escape hell if you try to kill your only hope of salvation?|`|TnquzeM5aa	I wouldn't change history. It might void my own birth.|`|eUXe2wtWaa	Jesus was destined to die to fulfill the prophecies. Whether it's the Sanhedrin, the Romans or me. Jesus had to die for our sins. But if I could go back and kill, it would be Hitler. People died in the name of Jesus but that was people misusing the name of God and Jesus for their own benefit. Events like the witch hunts and burning them at the stake was mans ignorance. Hitler was responsible for the deaths of over 25 million people, civilians and military, and he is the one I would kill.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	I'd kill The Bee Gees...(two down, four more to go?!?)

GPznIhzMaa	No, that's actually the ideal way to live a healthier life. A lot of people can't let go of things and/or overreact.

(and you did get emotional after the firing, so it's not like you're not emotional)     The hakuna matata outlook is a good thing to me as long as it's all about optimism, not a subconscious attempt to bottle up your negative emotions or bury your problems carelessly under the carpet until they explode one day.  But at the end of the day life is short and s*** happens.  We just gotta roll with the punches and move on to something better.  I think there are too many people out there in the world who aren't like you, who wallow in their sadness and never let things go, and who pity themselves and expect others to do the same.  If I were you I'd congratulate myself for not being one of them.|`|653j6x9maa	Your going to live your life either way, so why live it stressed? I think "hakkuna matata" is a wonderful way to live.
8G42oyydaa	In Canada possibly, you can get a grant to enable you to continue living in your home if you are disabled. Not sure about the son but I would give it a shot and challenge it if it is denied.

NnY5SsH8aa	Cutting the lights off makes you open your other senses.  As far as why they do it with the cameras and such I am not sure, but for just general phenomenon hunting not being able to see and look around you makes you more sensitive to "feeling" whats around you.  Unfortunately is doesn't work so well with people that are easily spooked, but once you learn to do not be spooked it really helps you tune into a room.|`|C8LD6xReaa	Well there is some logic to it things of that nature usually are more active during the night so it creates a much better environment or probability for things of that nature.

That's what really bothers me. I also believe that our time here is impermanent, but we should stop worrying about how we might be screwed over by some all powerful force if we screw up. Carpe Diem.

Today, materialism and rationalism create atheism and this grieves the heart of GOD. And even VIRIGN MARY the Mother of all, weeps every time she sees one taken away from GOD by the evil one. The peoples whom you say are mistreating women are the Cains of today and those who are   serving themselves with money are the judases of today. But these are being toyed by satan and as the world is dominated by the Cains and the Judases. But I will pray for you as follows: JESUS MY ONLY LOVE, I PRAY FOR THOSE WHOM YOU LOVE AND KNOW NOT HOW TO LOVE YOU. MAY THEY BE PURIFIED AND HEALED SO THAT THEY TOO BE EXEMPT FROM THE EVIL ONE. AMEN. And another prayer for you; JESUS TEACH US TO LOVE YOU TENDERLY AND GIVE THIS GRACE TO THOSE WHO DO NOT LOVE YOU AND DO NOT KNOW THE CONSUMING FIRE OF YOUR SACRED HEART. AMEN.

Women are equal to everyone else, as all life is sacred.  Also, Christianity really doesn't look down on anyone who thinks differently from them.  Sometimes, Christians just take things out of proportion.  They think that people who don't believe what they believe are completely wrong.  They've chosen to make that judgment.  It's not the actual religion, but I think it's the people sometimes.  Besides, all types of beliefs have their flaws.  It's what you choose to take into consideration that matters.  Just because you believe some things in a religion, doesn't mean you believe everything else, too.  I really don't judge.  I think it's great when people can look past judgments of beliefs and treat everyone the same way, and with the utmost kindness, just as you have.|`|AA11587827	how can an atheist, explain the world as we know it, life every thing u can see has a purpose, everything is Perfect as to sustain life, how can anyone say that it all happened with a big bang,even the scientist will tell u, nothing just happens, and im sure u know that everything has to have a foundation to build on if not it wont stand, and thats what religion is,|`|QNSz3dqtaa	You are entitled to believe what you want to believe.

I believe you are not trolling, so I really don't mean to be offensive, but just about everything in the way of freedom, education, liberty, charity in the history of man developed out of or because of Christians working by the guidance of the Holy Spirit.    Slavery ended because of Christians.(rent the movie Amazing Grace and learn about Wilbur Wilburforce)  Moslems still enslave people.  Women's rights are right out of the Bible.  Orphanages-most founded by Christians  Universities-originally founded by Christians  Bill of Rights- written by George Mason and Thomas Jefferson-both professing Christians.  Isaac Newton, Christopher Columbus, George Washington, and the list goes on and on.  All Christians.    But first and foremost.  What great love that the Father sacrifices His Son for our salvation.

HsT9sW5Xaa	The intention is not sweet or cool, in my opinion - especially in places where it is forced for women to wear it. To my understanding the scarf worn is a symbol of males being higher in Muslim society. Sexism is not sweet.    edit - Regardless, it's a tradition that began as a result of sexism. That much is clear considering some women are not given the choice of whether or not they can wear it. By continuing to wear it, you're promoting this attitude. That's all.|`|Jswomud7aa	I think that the intention behind it is really sweet.     They believe that their beauty should only be for the eyes of their husband, weather married or not.    EDIT: Muslim women are taught that should be modest, and cover their beauties like their hair and their chest. At home among family and in front of their husband, Muslim women do not need to wear head scarves.     Nothing is wrong with extreem modesty, it's better than looking like a hooker like some of the girls I see in America. There's a lot you can say about that!|`|HOXWWmsFaa	i think nothing of it|`|HI0oQriqaa	i think she may have hatred in her heart for me and other Americans. i'd like to send her and her family back to an arab country.|`|buiHdl0Gaa	She's a dummy - and religiously repressed by indoctrination.

I can assume that you haven't spoken to a Muslim woman nor have you asked her how she feels about her head scarf. Because if you have you would know it's dedication to religion, and it's a choice they make to wear it, and they don't like showing off there bodies to just anyone.    Are strippers more free to you? Are the chicks you lust after because of their short mini skirts free to you?  No, they're not free at all. They are brain washed by a society where they feel showing off their body to the world is needed.|`|25QHoApDaa	Depending upon whether she's wearing scarf because  1. Someone else asked/forced her to do so  2. It is a religious tradition.   3. She feels comfortable.    I think there is 'Lack of Liberty', 'Faith-fullness',  'Self Confidence' respectively.    There is no wise'ness wearing bikini at tundra and fur-coat in sahara. Ultimately you should wear comfortable outfit.

sEG4y06Eaa	Licensed brothels are legal in Nevada whereas prostitution outside of these brothels are illegal (a misdemeanor) on the streets.    So as wrong as it may seem to you, it is legal for her to do it. The publicity she gets seems a tad too much, but that's what the world has come to. Brothels have been tolerated in Nevada for many years. So if you don't like it, don't partake in it, and don't live near there.    As for your "would you ever do it?" question. No. My parents taught me better than to "give myself" away. My body is my temple. That doesn't mean others can't do what they want with their body, I have no say in it.    I could go into other peoples thoughts and views on prostitution, but I won't bother as it won't change anything.|`|76nTvO4iaa	This story is from last October.    Does anyone know how it ended?

They had no idea at all of how big is our universe!  They came up with a primitive creation story to explain how we were put together that is not much different from the stories told in the Middle East at that time. They created a God to go along with their story.  The God that they created is so narcissistically oriented that he begins to kill everybody if he doesnt get worshiped the right way without rest day and night! This God turned out to be quite a sadistic psychopath, too in desperate need of a shrink!     Revelation 4:8-9 (KJV) and they REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come* (*thats all that the Christians will do for ever and ever and ever when they get to Heaven).  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne    To add insult to injury all Christians want to be with Jesus in Heaven for ever and ever, but they dont stop to think what Jesus is saying that in Heaven he will be surrounded FOR ALL ETERNITY by 144,000 VIRGIN JEWISH GUYS who NEVER defiled themselves with WOMEN! Not bad! Gay oriented Bible writers and Preachers like Ted Haggard can only dream of a Heaven like that! BTW The promise for a number of men to be forever with Jesus were made to his Holy Jewish Apostles who forsook all family ties to follow Jesus as demonstrated by the institution of the Holy Communion* (*in lieu of the Jewish Passover that MUST BE celebrated in a family setting at home! Luke 14:26, Mark 10:28-30).     Revelation 14:3-4 (NIV) And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. NO ONE* (*in Heaven) COULD LEARN THE SONG except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. These* (*144,000 Jewish Virgin guys  Google Wikipedia, castrati) are those who DID NOT DEFILE THEMSELVES WITH WOMEN* (*Are they all gay sopranos trained by the Church over the centuries? They never dated or touched a girl no matter how virgin she claimed to be, but it doesnt say anything that they were fooling around with GUYS! Nuns need not to apply! No virgin girl is ever seen near Jesus anywhere or anytime in any of the Bible stories!) for they kept themselves pure. THEY FOLLOW THE LAMB WHEREVER HE GOES* (*any sexually liberated Christian guy wishing to come near Jesus aka The Lamb in Heaven will have to elbow himself in through these 144,000 virgin Jews while Christian ladies need to be very careful not to touch any of them!). They were purchased from among MEN* (*not among women!) and offered as firstfruits to God and the Lamb* (*Can you sense any sexual innuendo here?)    The most prominent Bible scholars (theologians) are telling us that the Bible cant be taken literally (short of seriously). Everything in the Bible is to be interpreted according to the dogmas of each particular Christian brand of faith.  So at the end let the best faith win!|`|CNotcjbaaa	Some were married, all were priests.    But I think maybe the ones who were married were older and didn't have that type of relatiionship with their wives
NekOuxFEaa	Just tell her you love her and she means so much to you as a friend. :) That simple !    And also, the way you make it sound. I am in NO way saying you are "bi, or lesbian, or even IN love with her" but it sounds like your REALLY connected as in there's a such thing as a straight-crush. It's when your emotionally attracted to a friend causing the feelings towards them to heighten, so if your worried you might...LIKE her chances are if shes the only same gender pal you feel like this towards don't worry about it and if she's such a great friend she should know that you don't mean it in a "homosexual way"|`|c1wCuGzpaa	Just say i love ya girl...or i love ya like a sista :) :)|`|l1iCPVPOaa	I love you!

I've been in this exact situation before. I loved her more than anyone in world. I wasn't in love with her, either, and we weren't romantically involved at all.  However, I'm not sure if I can answer this for you. With my friends, we tell each other we love each other all the damn time. I've you're struggling with just saying those words, then I'm not really sure what to tell you. I would just be honest. Besides, she's 18. She should be able to handle it without jumping to conclusions. You're just overthinking it :)      But a word of advice.. be careful. The girl I loved is no longer my friend. I loved her too much, to the point where it made me sick. She was extremely self-destructive, and brought me down with her. I had to let her go, even though it killed me to, because she was very toxic to me.

TinNG7k7aa	I don't agree with abortion for any reason.    Look at this picture (unless you are a coward and afraid to face what you would be killing):  http://www.bluebear.co.uk/images/downloa...    If this baby was unplanned or the result of rape, is it the baby's fault? What kind of sick monster could even consider aborting such a sweet child?    Whatever happens to a woman, why is it the innocent baby's fault and why must any baby's innocent life be extinguished to satisfy another person's desire?    It seems awfully selfish and arrogant to me. And I find the thought of even harming an innocent child most disgusting and shameful.    I wonder, if such a woman wishes to abort her baby, doesn't she feel any gratitude that her own mother did not abort her own life when she was helpless and unable to speak? What kind of black heart must such a woman have then?    Why not give a baby a chance at life instead of an early grave? At least give a baby up for adoption.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	You can thumb me down to infinity and I wouldn't change my opinion. It is murder, flat out. I don't believe in it for ANY reason except in the case that it will very much harm the mother. Rape? Why does the child have to suffer for the father's mistake? You didn't mean to? Then don't have sex and deal with it. A mother will go to jail for killing her new born, her 3 month old, her 12 month old, her 6 year old-yet she can kill a baby that just hasn't been born and suddenly it's okay?

It's as simple as that.  People can kick and scream about it as much as they want.  It doesn't change the fact that they are trying to force a woman into something she is unwilling to do at that point in her life.  Her body, her life, her choice.  I personally think it's more selfish to bring a child into the world that doesn't have EVERY opportunity for a wonderful life.  I think pro lifers fail to see that the mother is the one that is going to be looking after the child.  Well guess what, if she is a junkie or violent or has a violent partner or hasn't the financial means... that child is going to be neglected.  Life is not a rose garden.

I don't think that abortion is "wrong" or "right" in and of itself, I think that each individual woman has to make her own moral choice about the matter.  I think that abortion should be free, safe, and legal. Prior to abortion being legalized, they still went on, just in back alleys and in dangerous conditions. Abortion has existed since recorded human history. It always will exist, and I think we should give women the autonomy to decide what is ethically right or wrong for themselves.|`|RedEGIfZaa	I support elective abortion until the 26th week of gestation.

People say that everyone deserves life... but I dont think its fair to selfishly bring a child with severe disabilities into this world knowing that they will never live a full life.     I think that unless you have walked in that persons shoes that you have no right to judge their decision to have an abortion. People say 'put it up for adoption' .... take a look at the adoption agencies and children's homes that are over flowing with children that are unwanted. It is not fair to bring a life into this world and then give up responsibility for it.     Things happen... and I think the choice should ultimately be left up to the woman.|`|oUdo4kBYaa	abortion is good if the chicken coops get full.|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	it depends on the situation.    abortion is ok when:  raped  incest    abortion not ok when:  having sex and the person wants it, but not the baby  change of mind|`|suEP8YkFaa	The taking of anothers' life .. is murder by definition.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	My personal opinion is when a female in distress of unwanted pregnancy nothing wrong with abortion to free herself from misery.|`|4a635ec44438b74d7ce28e54d411c447aa	I see both sides of the argument. Personally, the deciding point for me was when I heard on the documentary "Lake of Fire" that before abortion was legal, the number one cause of death for women period was botched back-alley abortions. I saw a picture of a woman with a coathanger inside her, and she had bled to death from puncturing her uterus. Whether a fetus is a human being or not is irrelevant to me. Women do not deserve to feel like they need to risk death to control their own lives. A grown woman's death is far more real to me.|`|ihSvdnOvaa	I don't understand why some people support abortion but only till 26 weeks. What is the difference from day 1, to the last day of pregnancy?

Or...the claim that involves only ONE body, when it is obvious that a second one is growing with the intent to be born    If I choose to rob you blind and step on your dog on the way out, could I call you anti-choice since I consciously "chose" to do it, and say that you are narrow minded in limiting my options and free will?|`|q2cRdOV6aa	Well there is not one thing i can think of more barbaric than forcing a young baby's life to end because it's convenient or will save the mother a few months of her life.

It will be more ruined by living each day wondering what the child she murdered would have grown up to be...|`|uaGFRjeOaa	I think that abortion is wrong.  The life that you end when you abort a baby--a life--is sacred.  Some may argue that it isn't life yet, but it has the potential to become life.  It has the potential to become a living, breathing person with feelings.  By having an abortion, I think that you're never even giving it a chance to live.  I can see why many people might think it's best for the child or themselves.  They may not be able to support the child.  However, what they can do is find someone who can.  I think it's almost murder.  Even so, though, I don't blame people for having an abortion.  It's harder to tell that you're ending a life when you can't actually see that person or hear them talk.  I mean, would you appreciate it if someone never even gave you a chance to live?  Besides, that child, if birthed, could result in something very good.  They could contribute to our world and change our mistakes.  But if you don't give them a chance to, they never will.  So that's why I think abortion is wrong.|`|v2Ubw5hTaa	Abortion is another form of eugenics, voluntary eugenics.    Look at the demographics of people who opt for abortions. Unfortunately Yahoo! Answers hates free speech, so all I can say is "look at the demographics of abortions." If I get any more specific, I'll get banned.    Abortion kills off "those people." As a result, we have less criminals being born into this world, which is a good thing. We also have less low-IQ people being born into this world, another good thing.|`|IKsN4XQqaa	I personally think abortion is the most selfish act a person can do. There are certain circumstances where I think its necessary, like rape, or the mother risks death if she gives birth, but to abort a baby just because you're irresponsible is just wrong. Do you have any idea how many couples there are out there that can't have children on their own and have been on waiting lists for YEARS to adopt a baby!? And there's people out there who just kill theres because they were stupid. If you believe that you are responsible enough to have sex, then you should be responsible enough to deal with the consequences of having sex.|`|btLIW5xhaa	I think that abortion is murder and therefore should not be legal. Who are we to decide who lives and dies?    That being said, I'm also against the death penalty. I wonder why people rarely talk about that issue?    In the rare case of a medical emergency in which its either the mother and baby dies or the baby dies, then I definitely think that abortion should be aloud.        Adoption is an option!|`|7UV3OVANaa	abortion is absolutely wrong in my mind. Why would someone kill an innocent baby, still not born yet, and didn't have a chance to live? God gives us this gift, and we reject it by killing it. You might be a teenager, or a victim of rape, but you find comfort in the baby. And also, God might've given it to you for a reason, good might happen to you from this baby. I say:    SAY NO TO ABORTION! SAY YES TO PEACE!|`|v6l3o2kvaa	I'm pro-choice, and I think if someone wants to do that for whatever reason they can.  Thats it|`|pO8OzblHaa	If it's not my uterus, it's not my business.

I'll just copy my other answer because it still applies  --------------------------------------...    I hate hate HATE abortion. I believe a fetus is a life.    BUT, that is my view. Not everyone thinks a fetus is as important. So do I have the right to put my morals into law? No way.    I think eating meat is wrong. I think an animal's life is just about as important. I think humans are arrogant to think they are the only ones that matter. That is a moral value of mine. Does everyone agree? NO. So do I put my idea's into law? NO. I will NEVER get an abortion or encourage anyone to get one. But is anyone forcing me to do it? No. So I won't.     Sometimes though, abortion is necessary. Is it a good moral choice? No. But sometimes its the only choice. A fourteen year old girl doesn't need to walk around pregnant. Pregnancy changes a woman physically and emotionally.     People who get abortions aren't just doing it and dismissing it easily. Its a hard decision.    Oh and by the way, there would be less abortions if there were less unwanted pregnancies. There would be less unwanted pregnancies if we taught SAFE SEX along side abstinence.     Abstinence which is mostly supported by pro lifes ironically has led to more abortions. Kids hardly engage in abstinence and we're not teaching them to be safe if they DO indulge.
AA11440601	"What separates us as believers in Christ is much less than what unites us." (Pope John XXIII)    Almost all important doctrine is completely agreed upon between Catholic Christians and other Christians.     Here is the joint declaration of justification by Catholics (1999), Lutherans (1999), and Methodists (2006):    By grace alone, in faith in Christ's saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts while equipping us and calling us to good works.    http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontif...    There are many minor doctrine issues and some major cultural traditional differences which, I believe, do not matter that much.    A Catholic worships and follows Christ in the tradition of Catholicism which, among other things, recognizes that Christ made Peter the leader of His new Church and Pope Benedict XVI is Peter's direct successor.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/inde...    With love in Christ.|`|zefFTf8Aaa	Catholics have the Eucharist.    the official teaching of the Catholic Church, does it teach that we can work our way into Heaven? They cant, because it doesnt. The Catholic Church does not now, nor has it ever, taught a doctrine of salvation by works...that we can work our way into Heaven.    Second, I ask them to show me where in the Bible does it teach that we are saved by faith alone. They cant, because it doesnt. The only place in all of Scripture where the phrase Faith Alone appears, is in James...James 2:24, where it says that we are not...not...justified (or saved) by faith alone.    So, one of the two main pillars of Protestantism...the doctrine of salvation by faith alone...not only doesnt appear in the Bible, but the Bible actually says the exact opposite - that we are not saved by faith alone.    Third, I ask them that if works have nothing to do with our salvation...then how come every passage in the N.T. that I know of that talks about judgment says we will be judged by our works, not by whether or not we have faith alone? We see this in Rom 2, Matthew 15 and 16, 1 Ptr 1, Rev 20 and 22, 2 Cor 5, and many, many more verses.    Fourth, I ask them that if we are saved by faith alone, why does 1 Cor 13:13 say that love is greater than faith? Shouldnt it be the other way around?    As Catholics we believe that we are saved by Gods grace alone. We can do nothing, apart from Gods grace, to receive the free gift of salvation. We also believe, however, that we have to respond to Gods grace. Protestants believe that, too. However, many Protestants believe that the only response necessary is an act of faith; whereas, Catholics believe a response of faith and works is necessary...or, as the Bible puts it in Galatians 5:6, For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumsion is of any avail, but faith working through love...faith working through love...just as the Church teaches.|`|wyXCRGv6aa	well, i know that their both stupid.|`|TkUL4OINaa	Catholics had a long history, beginning from Roman Empire. But they kept dividing through wars.

But they have tons of believers.     Methodist- The founder was John Wesley? but methodist was formed by his followers? The group stress on methods.    God wants Oneness, not divisions.
ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	We teach that Jehovah of the Old Testament was in fact the literal Son of God, Jesus Christ, the same that gave Moses the Ten Commandments and provided prophets.    Jehovah was the Firstborn of the Father and is a God in all accounts. He has commanded us, however, to pray always to the Father, but in His name. That is what we do.    Jesus Christ is the Creator of this Earth and the universes as we know them. The word 'preincarnate' might confuse many people. The simple fact is this: Jehovah, otherwise known as Jesus Christ, existed in the pre-mortal existence with the Father in spiritual form before He came to earth in mortality.    We all existed in spiritual form in the pre-mortal existence before we came to take ourselves a body in mortality.

They call the Father God as Elohim and Jesus is Jehovah.    I think I also read that they believe May, the mother of Jesus, had sex with Elohim, and that is how they got Jesus. Mary remains virgin because McConkie taught that she did not lose her virginity because she had sex with God and not with a human.|`|PKWHLbdfaa	Per LDS doctrine, Elohim or God the Father, had a spirit child named Jehovah.  Through Jehovah, he created all things.  Elohim had other spirit children that he wants to grow up to be like Jehovah and rule over worlds and be Gods too.  That's right, it's you and me.  Man grew up to be God so Jehovah...later Jesus showed us the way to become a God.  So Mormons kind of have a version of "why can't you be more like your older brother" going in their head.    Much better is to realize the truth that God become man, entered into human history, died the death we should have died, saved us from ourselves and continues to run to us when we turn to him.  Jesus was never created as there was never a time he wasn't God since God is uncreated and is eternal, without beginning of days.  Through the working of God in us, we can attain Godly attributes.  Now that's good news.|`|jdRKZe18aa	You question is worded  oddly...    We believe that Jehovah was indeed the premortal Jesus CHrist and the Son of God - and the 2nd member of the Godhead, Yes.  You ask this like it is somehow strange - which it isn't.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

Then when I was in the airport going home, I said I was a model, and they ******* put me in a ******* prison cell for six hours. I'm a ******* high fashion model. Not a ******* terrorist! They are so so so so so so nasty towards us Americans. When I put on a fake *** British accent they were all buddy buddy. Now I can't stand their accents. I used to really like them, just because they smile a lot, but they only ******* smile when they are in the US because everyone is complimenting them for their odd accent.

BLB9Dx2daa	You should do something simple but thoughtful.  Do something original like get her a gift that has to do with an inside joke.     One time I told my boyfriend that I was so dangerous I should have caution tape wrapped around me.   So he got me caution tape hahaha.   He also got me red roses.     Girls loveee getting flowers.   Even if they say they don't    You should write her a card! A written letter is not one of those one's that get's thrown out after a couple weeks.   It truly comes from the heart and says that you truly care about her.     You might also want to just lay down and cuddle with her that's very romantic.     Oh, I have a joke.     Why can't lesbians be romantic?  Cause there's no man!  [roMANtic]      My perfect Valentines day does not consist of getting diamonds or chocolates.   It would consist of appreciation and showing each other that you really do care.    Good Luck.   And I hope you have a great V-day!|`|2jnpvyzaaa	a rose at day time .and a night out.|`|DFy2pESGaa	Well it all depends on what your gf likes. I mean me the way I like to usually spend my valentines day is with my bf. Nothing fancy for me just sitting outside if the weather is nice and cuddling. What you should do is show her how much you love her. Like have someone give her some roses for you and you put a note in the roses telling her to meet you somewhere or just simply that you love her. IDK it all depends on her personality and how and what she likes. Just to simple little things that you know she likes. If she likes stuffed animals then give her a stuffed animal. Make sure you compliment her on ordinary things. Also you should notice the little things that she does like wearing a different perfume, doing something to her hair, noticing new clothes, or when she paints her nails. That way she knows that your not some materialistic kind of guy and that you only notice her. That would be ANY girls valentines dream to be noticed for the little things. Oh and if shes into poetry recite a poem...no notes. Do something that you normally wouldn't do to show her how much you appreciate her.|`|KLkczo6naa	awhh, snuggling with your lover.    i don't think gifts should be a part of it, except roses and chocolates.    i think spending time is enough for valentine's day.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	a card candy or flowers|`|qcB23QvZaa	well my number one idea would be TIME. like for my boyfriend to take me to a place i love, like to the movies, etc..    twilight is dumb    anyway, if you REALLY want gift ideas (which i suggest you don't because EVERYONE gets their girlfriend teddy bears and necklaces)    then i suggest writing her a song or poem (if you're that kind of guy) if not you could always just take the easy way out and buy her some perfume    if money is really no object get her a card|`|DdYTRUmHaa	I'm not really into anything romantic, you could just sit through twilight ha, it's not that bad and it would probably mean a lot to her, i made one of my friends watch it and i thought it was sweet that he did it for my benefit.    jewelery and chocolates are good, flowers aren't amazing..unless she's like over 20.|`|NwYwLdsNaa	A fairytale night would be romantic:    Have her dress up semi-formal.  Pick her up in a limo.  Have flowers and champagne(if over 21).  Take her to a fancy restaurant.  Have the waiter bring her the gift you bought her(jewelry of some sort) during dessert time.  Finish it off with more champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in the limo.  I'm don't know her or you, so I am keeping it PG-rated!  :)  Have a great evening!
YOWnMp0Xaa	Impossible question to answer. Death is the end of life, and being brought "back to life" means death has not occurred. Any experiences or lack of experiences between the pseudo-death and rescuscitation would therefore be irrelevant.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	I think I'd accept the events in the scenario you described as evidence of some sort of afterlife. on the other hand, it's probably quite irrelevant to the real world. people who are brain dead don't seem to have any experiences to report!|`|CNotcjbaaa	"For god believers- Lets say all those 500 thousand people say for the hour that they've been dead they've all experienced the same thing, there is no god, no afterlife, no heaven, no hell.

It just means the heart stops working.  It does not mean your BRAIN ceases to function.    There is actually a chemical produced by your brain called DMT that is released in these situations.     It causes hallucinations.|`|AA11692259	id convert if i was one of the ones brought back........  if i died..and came back.... but then again.. i would have to seriously doubt my own conditions of ... being DEAD...as having affected my rational thinking|`|KhJwOurLaa	Atheists know that most people see social archetypes when having this experience.|`|DvoP2aawaa	IF this happened, I could see god believers saying something like "God knew I was gonna come back to life so he didn't show me any afterlife" or something to that effect.   For the atheists, and I can only speak for myself in this case, but for me I would begin to believe in god - yes, and it would make me happy. You see, I really like the IDEA of all the happy heaven stuff, being reunited with loved ones and having eternal bliss and all you have to do is accept jesus and confess your sins. I love the idea, but I find it really hard to buy into, that's why I'm an atheist. But if your hypothetical situation happened I think I would start to believe in a god (not to say a bible god) and I think people would become more religious also.   Peace!|`|AA11793638	*grabs a bowl of popcorn and diet pepsi*. This is pascals wager with a little twist.  Unless I experience it myself, it wouldn't make a difference on how I view religion and god.|`|AA11217207	No on both accounts. Not remembering an afterlife does not mean there is none. Also many theists believe in a divine plan. God knows if you are dead forever and if you aren't you might not have been let into the afterlife.     The shared vision of 500 would not convert all atheists into theists. However most atheists base their belief on the lack of evidence or action of a supreme being. Theists all ready base their belief on faith. It might be more probable to expect more people to convert to theism in the 2nd scenario then the reverse action in the first. However the shared vision is not completely unexplainable. One major flaw i see all ready is that everyone was revived by the same process.     You might expect some change from either scenario. Neither however will be enough proof to everyone. Also note that most religious wars are fights between opposing theists. Not theists and atheists. even if everyone accepted the presence of a god they would still be disagreement over what that god wanted.
mX2BA9Ucaa	1. My uncle was born with spina bifida.    2. I became aware that my uncle was different when i was about 7 and i asked him about his funny scar on his lower back. He then told me in the simplest way that he was born with his spine not right. I had always wondered why he had to wear leg braces and crutches all the time , and i had finally gotten my answer.    3. Well, i couldn't really say because my uncle is 5 years older than me and was adopted by my grandmother. Apparently, his mother saw him and didn't want him she wanted a "normal son".    4. My family knew what they were getting into i could assume. But I dont feel it has impacted my family, we treat him the same as any other and we love him just as much.    5. Well, the school accommodations were pretty great for living in such a rural community. The bus would pick him up every morning and the bus driver would help my uncle up the stairs and down the stairs. The school was also very understanding and they understood when he would take a long league of absence or when he had to stay wheel chaired for a month. The school also pushed for more wheelchair accesible pavements and his school mates would offer to push him around when he would get tired.    6. I feel this has been a learning experience for my whole family, because it opened our eyes that even though some people aren't born normal or proper that doesnt change the fact that their are human beings with feelings and emotions. My family welcomed my uncle into our family and we treat him all the same, we love him dearly. My uncle taught me that people with disabilites still like to do the same things as normal people.     7. Once i was speaking to my uncle and he was telling me of his frusterations. He told me that some of his friends had told him that his disease seems fun. His exact words were "It wasn't fun, it was never fun. I had so many surgeries done when i was little and i hated every one of them." Some people treat him like he cant do anything, and i believe that that is his biggest frusteration he has, because my family never treated him differently so he believes that he can do anything, which is true. My Uncle can do a lot of things, the doctors told my grandparents that he would never walk again but now he walks to the store or walks to the gym. The doctors told my grandparents that he would die soon after birth, but here he is living to his 21st birthday a couple of months ago. To my uncle, disabled is only a word and he is not willing to give up, he fights his disease everyday .    My Uncle is my hero, he never lets anything really get to him.   I hope this helps with your paper.  Much Luck !|`|QveBSjFSaa	1) Stargardt's Macular Dystrophy (progressive, degenerative loss of central vision), I am her mother.  2) I never suspected, her teachers told me that she had to ask someone to read the board in class, then referred her to school nurse, who referred us to a specialist, and my daughter has been seeing specialists ever since.  3) Not a thing, had never even heard of it.  4) I would say it's affected us more post-diagnosis, insofar as it is degenerative and progressive (it took 6 months for her to go legally blind from the date of diagnosis, and her vision continues to get worse and worse.)  5) I recently transferred her to the the middle school in our city that actually has an acredited program for visually impaired students. At the school that she was at prior to this, she had a VI teacher come once weekly, as well as an orientation and mobility instructor. Here, she has Braille training everyday, and has access to cctv's, all her books and handouts are in large (and I mean LARGE) print, and still has her o & M training. We also were fortunate enough to become affiliated with the Braille Institute mere days after the diagnosis, and that has been a godsend as well.  6) Learning, absolutely, learning about this disease, learning about the constant adaptations because of it, learning how to provide safety and organization at all times, the learning has not stopped.  7) I haven't run into any misconceptions, just a lot of understanding and support, but we are almost brand new to this(diagnosis April 2008).One thing that I have encountered alot is she's in GATE classes/ she plays sports/she can walk without a cane/she gets great grades SO she must be okay.  What they don't realize is that she has a will of iron. She never complains about a thing. She moves along as if there is nothing different because she refuses to slow down. In fact, that's why I didn't know that anything was wrong... never once did she tell me that she was having a hard time seeing, never once did her grades falter.  When I saw how absolutely HUGE her blind spots were, and how little of her field of vision she has left, I cried. Mostly because I am so proud of the little trooper that she is. And partly because I had no idea that anything was wrong.And partly because, although it is not the end of the world, and although things could be much worse, this disease raised the bar, and narrowed the field for her, my daughter who has been a natural at just about anything she's ever done.|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	1.

Mental  retardation  in  70s  was  treated  very  differently  in  schools  then  is  today.  Children  were  kept  seperated from  regurlar  class.

It  was  a  great  strees which  I  was  not  even  aware  of  till we  divorced  and  I  moved  where  I  had  relatives  to  help.   5.Today  all children  are  Mainstreamed and  required  to  have  any  extra  assistance  to  go  to  school  normally. This  came  in  effect   early  80s  but  may  want  to check that. My  son  had  Special  Ed  graduation  in  1989.   6. Yes  we  all have  researched  when  we  can. I  had  2  more  children  with  out  problems  and  also  grandchildren.It  was  a  concern  for  them  when  they  became  pregnant.

Of course it has been a learning experience.  We have had to adapt our entire life to incorporate the disabilities my husband has as well as make him feel useful and needed.    7.

When did you first suspect that your family member had a problem or disability? (If theyve had it your whole life, when did you first become aware that they were different?)  very early on.    3. What did you know about this disability before diagnosis? (If you can recall the diagnosis)  nothing.    4. Do you feel as though it impacted your family more pre or post diagnosis?  Post, because the diagnosis was very early of course.    5. How would you rate the accommodations provided by school, educators, and/or general community?  Eh. So-so. Could do a lot better.    6. Do you feel that this has been a learning experience for your whole family? How so?  Yes.    7. Are there any common misconceptions you think other people have about what it means to live with a learning disability?  Yes.

My daughter, she has epilepsy and physical and mentally handicapped  2. When she was born she couldn't suck and I thought there was something wrong with her but the doctor said no. She was six months old when she had her first seizure  3. pretty much everything.  She has seizures weekly and can not speak has trouble walking and talking. We didn't get the diagnosis until this year and she is twelve.  4 some things that were before the diagnosis were things like people would walk up to me and want to cast out the demon  or they would ask me what I did to her to make her like she was. You know, like did I drop her on her head or something.  Or they would say things like You must have been a drunk during your pregnancy.  These things made me as her mother feel really horrible.  I wondered if I had done something to her.    After her diagnosis it wasn't any different except that now I can tell doctors and anyone else that ask that she has a genetic mutation and that is the reason that she is the way she is. It wasn't anything I did to her.  .    5.  We have her in special ed and they have not given us much in the way of accommodations.  She has a one on one aide and an aide who rides on the bus with her and she has medicine that is given if she starts seizing. I would like it if we could get more help with her. Like air conditioning on the bus. She has a horrible time with heat and cold.  They could do this but it would cost them money and they don't want to.  I have to transport her on really hot days or really cold days.      6. I think my other kids are more compassionate towards handicapped people and people who are different and they know how to deal with seizures and they know first aid and CPR.  Most teens don't know anything about that.    7. Hmm not sure i can answer that.  I believe people don't have any idea how hard our life is because of her.  The doctor bills, the trips to the ER.  The medicines that we have to pay for. They have no concept of what it is like to live in a family where one person is constantly draining the disposable income of all the others.  Add to that the down turn in the economy and you have a situation for disaster.    Edit: 8.  One question you didn't ask.  Would I take on this burden again if i had the chance. Absolutely. She is worth it. She is an amazing person who has had to over come so many obstacles in her path. She has a life that is hard but worth living.  She has given back her love a hundred percent and she never stops trying. I did not want to give you the idea that she was not worth the sacrifice.

uz9GtV9vaa	This mirrors the subconscious thought process of most human beings, and somewhat explains why so many people are such d-bags.  Your brain literally can't build up a tolerance to love, though.    What you've essentially just told me, is that you don't believe in love and God, because you have invested your faith and love, and haven't received a substantial return on your investment.   Well, I hate to break it to you, but just because some crook has conned you out of your money doesn't mean the stock doesn't exist.  Poor analogy, but I think it works.    Whether you're a believer or not, everyone should follow the Golden Rule:  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.  You don't need to be a cruel man to survive in this world.  You need to be cunning.  You need to keep your eyes open and be prepared for anything.  As I said, you can't build up a tolerance to love, but you can build up a tolerance to the empty gratification you get from hate.  If you live like a cruel man, you will surely suffer as one.  I don't think Madoff is too happy right now, if you know what I mean.      The feeling of love is intense at first and seems to fade as people get older, but the effects of love don't fade away on their own.  You have to keep novelty in the relationship if you want the feeling to remain strong.  It's like listening to music.  You can get tired of listening to the same song over and over again, but you never get tired of listening to all music completely.   Some people are wired differently, and novelty or stimulation can be more of a challenge for them, but the brain is designed to sustain a committed relationship to build a family.    Another example besides music is food.  You usually don't build up a tolerance to the pleasure you get from eating, so the satisfaction you get from eating a certain amount remains the same today as it will be 30 years from now, usually.  Everyone's wired uniquely, so some do build up a tolerance, which contributes to morbid obesity, but most, including me, are satisfied with a certain amount of food and nutrition throughout life.  Some things you build a tolerance to, some you don't.  Just the way our mind works.    I agree with you that the world is a prison.  Most definitely.  But don't lose hope.  I haven't.      I read those articles.  I didn't know about PEA but I did know about oxytocin and vasopressin.  The one article about "love junkies" reinforces my point about novelty.  Those junkies however, found novelty in multiple relationships.    It might also help to let nature take its course and wean yourself off the PEA love reaction and return to it later on in cycles, while maintaining the relationship.  So, the relationship wouldn't have that spark all the time, but only periodically.  Imagine the feeling someone gets from smoking cigarettes, they become addicted, and decide to quit.  If they have a cigarette a week after quitting, that cigarette would bring them much more pleasure than if they'd smoked an hour ago.|`|d9cB8yN8aa	Nice.|`|D4LnRg2Daa	Can't place it I Am Not.  Can't place it.  Its back there somewhere in the cobwebs of my mind but no.  Those Beautiful cruel words escape me.  A lot like love isn't it?  Reality cuts in and love goes out the window.  But is that reality or depression?  the reality is love, real love never dies.  It has nothing to do with a chemical reaction or endorphins.  Real love lives in the hearts and lives of the millions of people who have found it, the ones who have been together for 30, 40 or 50 plus years and loved every day like my mom and dad.  The lucky ones, the soul mates.  They never let the sun set on an unkind word and they love each other still in the world beyond tomorrow.  Love Kent.|`|TfgTVBQsaa	There cannot be a definition for Love because everyone's reality is different, and my perception of it will not benefit you because my "version" is for me and my experience. But I'll say Love is not material to me; there is no way that what I've experienced these past few months was caused by the release of chemicals. Oh yes, they played a large role, but they weren't the cause.    No matter what, you're always going to have chemicals in your brain. Chemicals are material, brain is material, the body is material, as is the illusion, (or prison). These things we cannot control. What we can control though is what we say, how we act, what we write...  thousands of things! If it begins with a thought, an intention, it is YOU. And if you don't like how a thought makes you, you can change that.    Your brain tells your body what to do, but your mind, the thought, comes first.    Want to control your reality? Monitor your thoughts, and observe their immediate effects on your actions, and the reactions. Just stay true to who you know yourself to be.    P.S. Don't EVER let a horoscope define who you are.     P.S.S. "...so to survive I shall be a cruel man...I Love the answer...I love debates...Go forth and prosper..."

This includes men who like going down on women. African Americans are even more conditioned than caucasians in this respect. We are conditioned to hate our genitals, so if we not only love our own, but love anothers-- we will be ostracized.  2 American society is all about the male-female sexual dichotomy.  We are all about sex, hetero sex. Males are supposed to "need" sex, so male on male sex is okay. Women aren't supposed to want or like sex, so 2 women liking sex is wrong.  What a shame.|`|62eb64f00529ec4e271b0beecf4776c0aa	Isn't it Vice-Versa?|`|YvNMUnR6aa	i accept lesbians more. thats prolly cause im male. if your female and not homosexual like me then you probably accept gays more. but seriously i would way rather see to girls make out then 2 guys just like harley said or whatever her name was.|`|cIPziIdnaa	I believe it's getting easier for all of us - but on balance, I still think lesbians are more accepted.|`|Im9cwUIyaa	Well I live in Texas and there are TONNSS of Lesbians at our school..

Gay men are feared as a threat to their sexual identity. Gay women are trivialized as fetish objects. I don't know which is worse or more disrespectful, but at the end of the day all minorities are more or less in the same same boat as the despised 'other' in one way or another.|`|913b2b28dab37b750de4933b73ae1304aa	I don't really think either are more publicly accepted than the other. More men reject gay men, but on the other hand, more women reject gay women.   When it comes to tv shows and movies, I would say the only conclusion I can come up with is that (sadly) many people think lesbians can be considered "pornographic".|`|WFYtrtRmaa	i dissagree baby!|`|I0xO8IAHaa	Gay guys accually have it harder than lesbians.     Like this  lesbians walks into  the store and nobody cares.  Gay guys walk in the store and everyone stares and whispers so i think you should make it the other way around|`|sMauXwaIaa	i've seen more films about lesbians than about gay guys!The only one that comes to my mind is Brokeback Mountain, On the other hand, we have Lost and Delirious, Imagine me and you, Bound, But I'm a cheerleader, Kissing Jessica Stein(i loved this one except for the ending) Better than chocolate , Saving face, and Nina's heavenly delights. So there is plenty to pick out from. Basically some directors want to explore the homosexual theme but most of them do it too carefully and without exposing the viewer to the way things really are.

That doesn't mean that lesbians are accepted more, but they're definitely ridiculed less.|`|JT2nkgmGaa	In my opinion lesbians are more excepted because most guys aren't weirded out by them. In fact some think that its hot.   On the other hand sometimes girls ridicule others for being lesbian.

It is simply a sexual orientation, like any other. unfortunately it is being used by skanky lil girl in nightclubs and mtv specials as a way to attract boys or be known as a "bad girl" (very pathetic)    There is no matter of being for it or against it, its not a "lifestyle" choice or a decision on were to put a bus stop. What people do in their bedrooms (whether they are gay, lesbian, straight, asexual, transexual, bisexual, crossdressing) is no body's business|`|AA10985602	I think it is strange that people are against it, think its wrong or think its a lie.  According to Kinsey, most people are bisexual, somewhere along the spectrum.   Why can't it not matter?|`|N73oZyY8aa	I am only interested in the relationship that I'm involved in. I reserve no right to have an opinion on the private lives of others. To do so I believe is intrusive. Since I object when other try to interfere in my private life, I have no intention to interfere in the private lives of others. To do so would render me a hypocrite.    I think your lecture was inappropriate and were I there I would have make it known.|`|300aa90c6e4459736882fabd827b612faa	It doesn't bother me one way or another.  I'm not bi but if it's what makes others happy then by all means go for it.  I don't understand why people care so much if someone is bi.  They're not greedy or whores, they are just attracted to both genders... big deal.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	We're the best!  Why would someone be "against" bisexuality?|`|Y9qTbFFraa	i guess i'm for it but that's because i am it lol|`|YdwHmohPaa	its a sin|`|IiscnSGGaa	i think that people need to let people do what makes them happy :/|`|CotWcTI0aa	I'm totally for it. I mean, why is it bad? And it's not like they choose to be ayways. At least it's not a disease--it doesn't cause any harm to anybody. Who cares what (or who) you like. As I always say, just because most people like chocolate, doesn't mean you can't like vanilla instead, or both. I always get both on my ice cream by the way... Back to the topic: I don't see anything wrong with it. Even if you chose to be bi, it's still fine. Also, what I mean when I say that I'm for it, is that I believe it is ok.    BTW  Prop. 8 passed last year in CA  =(  Just wanted to share my disagreement with the results  =)    Oh and BTW I am straight  =)|`|nooocNV1aa	4 it cuz I am it!!!!!!!! LETS GO BISEXUALS    bbbbuuuutttttttt  (quiet, might piss somebody off)|`|vDG0iA8laa	Everybody has to have their feeling about things, and if a person is "bi" this is their way of showing affection for both genders, and it's okay in my books..  Better to be up front about it, that "string" people along with  lies etc.  Best that these things are discussed amongst people than they find out through incorrect "sources"..  Rachelle in High Heels|`|tNRM86lXaa	4 it cuz i am it|`|I44n8Eb1aa	its not really something you can be for, or against, it just is. like, you can't be against the sky being blue, or against heterosexuality, is just another fact of life and another unique variation in certain humans.  I'm all for love, in every shape and form.|`|9l3Oil9zaa	i don't care for it and i don't really understand it but it's not for me to understand.  i believe that bisexuals can love either man or woman or have sex with either.  i used to say i was bi but in really i was gay hiding behind bi. lol  I don't trust bi girls because they will end up fuccing a guy behind your back.  my gf claims she's bi in a lesbian relationship but i mean w/e...|`|WSZUVs4paa	as a lesbian, i think bisexuality is just a phase of not knowing what you want, aka being 'confused'..but i do understand where your coming from, just be careful :)
sS7PpQEDaa	Probably Catherine...she did much to bring Russia up to Western European cultural standards as well as enlarging the empire.|`|Q02aMlHWaa	empress means queen of an empire  queen is just the queen of her homeland|`|pERcBM9qaa	Catherine|`|xoN9PUA2aa	Catherine. Her empire was much stronger, plus under her they were able to defeat some of the ottomans.
IAXhu2tuaa	Always appeal violation notices. I have been reported many times, and only lost a few. If you don't appeal them, then the report monkeys win.|`|USd2LAOUaa	I don't believe a violation notice is equal to a sin, young Jackie Cheung....|`|2k8TEiRtaa	WHAT ?? Who are you taking to ?
kMyZEEhNaa	A dirty weekend out in the country. Stay in a warm, rustic cabin. Chicks love that sort of thing.|`|ASVatVfUaa	take her shoping|`|YtKKu6Umaa	yea concert tickets ,  Go to the movies ,   Chocolate  ,  go out to dinner  ,    bed .... hard to help when i don't know where you live . like amusement park or water park ,  cell phone store   ,   make up   , a card ,,,    a pet       hope i help :)|`|I6vMxEU9aa	Concert tickets? That's what I want, but my husband won't take the hint.|`|MZPuDifYaa	Some Black Roses.  A CD.  Write her a song, or a poem.|`|luQZnvLVaa	aww, you stole my idea with the razor:((|`|oRGJuImGaa	get her a book by her favorite author or a cd by her favorite band stuff like that might help...|`|UxbjvAaRaa	get her something like a black bear. she most likely will like that.|`|mMOx4Qe1aa	does she want any tattoos or piercings!? i would love my bf to get me a tattoo! lol|`|oQxmkVGhaa	get her a gift card to hot topic!|`|drzN1kkuaa	concert tickets?  nice dinnner.    you know what she likes, take her to do it, or see it, or whatever,.|`|qcB23QvZaa	ok well get her a giftcard to hot topic?    just kidding haha    the best present you can get someone is presence..    so for her present, give her a little piece of paper. that says like "this entitles you to one movie night" or something fun like that
84nXWNT3aa	He was sitting there watching the entire time, the sadistic bastard.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	God was watching over that little girl and was waiting to take her to heaven as soon as she died.  Sometimes God does 'bad things' to one innocent to save many ... but the innocent who die for many have an 'automatic' entry into Heaven.|`|1hciyvKdaa	have no clue what your talking about, glad I missed the news :(|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	everywhere|`|FCRX9MJMaa	He was giving Jesus "the talk".|`|7c73d357ee89c177275de5c2d1c35fd2aa	We are probably going to hear soon enough that god told her to do it.  Sick people frequently attribute god to their lives and their actions to god.|`|dbw210qqaa	Some pay here and some pay there|`|LbGRsCTKaa	God didn't do it.    You're wrong that God is guilty.    He allows every one of us to make choices.    It's called free will.|`|0hT85XLzaa	God was watching from a distance.|`|AA12257580	The same place God has been for all of his existence - inside the minds of people.|`|AA10168935	Realties like this prove there is no god.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Waiting for a fundie to stop and pray for her?|`|BN5nW4rZaa	where where you?   or Obamachrist?|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	God is watching...don't worry, God will deal with her and her bf in due time.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Exactly my point.  If there really was an all loving God,wouldnt have stopped this?Its not like he doesnt have the power too,hes freaking God! He could have zapped her with a bolt of lighting.  Why let someone suffer if you have the power to stop it?|`|zYAQrnjcaa	What lady?|`|T7vuRDCVaa	The same place he was when they did it to Jesus.|`|SlkKa1jsaa	god is always watching|`|cb4436697a935c843c809ed2c03d5ccdaa	Why blame God? We all have free will choice ... It's not Gods fault.. It's the person who commits these terrible crimes.|`|nxbuPeoCaa	on the toilet|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	God was hanging on a cross...having been tortured himself.|`|YCeendraaa	you cant blame god for something like that.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	God doesn't get involved in the specifics.  He's more of a big picture kind of guy.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	he was the lady|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	God doesn't control what happens. I don't believe in the Christian God, or any other organized religions God, but I believe that people like the woman will get what she deserves. God doesn't interfere, but it doesn't let things that sick go unpunished.|`|kyFwz7kYaa	There is a God, He is alive, in Him we live, and we surive. There has been, and always will be a God, and everything that God does happens for a reason and no one has the authority to question that.|`|UIpobEThaa	Torture and murder go on everyday. Are you just waking up?  Why did God allow all those heads to be cut off in recent years?  We simply don't know.|`|8uUpAKPtaa	What lady? And have you ever heard of this little thing called free will? God created it so people could do whatever they want, good or bad. He doesn't control us....|`|xdqSp48Jaa	Casey Anthony made a CHOICE to do what she did,  God had NOTHING to do with it!|`|8gDRQ7v2aa	RJR-said it|`|oWAUn0leaa	watchin his soaps|`|vxqtaBHpaa	he works in mysterious ways|`|sqaRnidQaa	he was warming up the ticket to heaven. heaven looks prettier when you go through hell|`|ahci6qGUaa	dont ever question the big guy upstairs|`|Yg4nHA7raa	whats god?|`|xSu5A4eYaa	on the potty, lol|`|3SJGGOORaa	Not there.|`|2tR5zKEuaa	Waiting for the girl to come home. Having enough mercy to give the woman a chance to repent. It is a sad thing what happened to the girl, but she gets a much better reward than human life.|`|6AT498UTaa	God is everywhere calling out to everyone to accept the atonement and be made new. You think we should judge God because people sin?  Some people are not hearing from God are you?|`|VG8IVkB4aa	******* bitches and hoes.\  While the rest of us sufer..   And have a long and painful death..  We all have a fun life..  And it always ends up teriblely..  Where's our happy ending..?|`|AA11559211	he was yelling at the cop who took the day off instead|`|r1UQZTjraa	god was chillaxin with ghandi and einstein|`|3toGqUUHaa	God gives everything in life a purpose it sometimes just takes a while to truly see this.|`|dshJUFxFaa	it's true tht GOD was not there at tht moment.GOD was unable to save that girl..............but still he observed the incident.......& the lady will be suffered for her cruel & brutal activities.......GOD never apologize her...........she should be punished but not physically it would be mentally......spiritually
3ViTBLovaa	Ya I'm pretty sure I've heard this before.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	i dont know but mine are mixed blue/green/gray with gold around the middle...thats kinda interesting
XwFxZLc6aa	Oh HELL YEAH I feel pressure to be thin.  And I don't really think I'm fat but until I have washboard abs I'll probably be struggling with this.  It sucks too because I honestly believe I care more about a guy's personality than whether or not he has a six pack, but I'm not sure most guys feel that way. :-(|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Yes. I know for my own body, I have a great desire to be thin. There is this full length life sized picture of twiggy on the wall at my hairdressing school. I sometimes just stare up at it and wish I looked like that. My diet is very strict and I'm a health nut. I've lost weight but I'm still 15 pounds off my goal. I don't know if I want to be thin because of the media, or my own sense of aesthetics. I like curvy women actually, like real curvy. And guys I like when they are slightly muscular. Toned, not gross. So it's only myself that I care if I'm thin, I dunno.|`|RhX0TxOBaa	I do, I've gotten to the point where I'm freakin bulimic.|`|7wqIJbPjaa	meee i'm on a diet and am busting a** at the gym.     but this is for me and only me, its a confidence and self esteem booster, i'm always happier when i'm thinner.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	not me.|`|FqiA5BRraa	I don't have to try and be thin, im naturally thin.|`|XnNT4l0Xaa	Yeah. I feel fat most the time. But I don't think it has anything to do with my sexuality.|`|S4wvTECOaa	I could care less if I was thin or not. But I do like to keep in shape (running, jogging, exercising..etc.) most of the time. Being fit makes me happier.. (:  EDIT: I also have quite a fast metabolism. :D|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	I do, because I'm naturally on the bigger side. I'm not fat, but I'm not thin. But, as a butch lesbian, I've noticed that all of the other butch chicks that are considered especially hot are especially thin. So, I feel like I need to be underweight to be attractive.    But, if it makes you feel any better. I, as a lesbian, am attracted to WOMEN. Women have breasts and asses and curves. And, for me, stick thin doesn't look attractive. I need a little meat on my woman's bones.|`|yy9ECUpEaa	I used to, when my girlfriend had the mentality of an anorexic. She never pressured me, but when you're around someone who thinks that if she eats 200 calories she's disgusting, you start to adopt that mindset.    But we both got better. And when I went from 130 pounds to 140 pounds, she actually REALLY liked it, so I'm actually feeling more pressure NOT to be thin =). Which is rather nice.|`|2nQynHp7aa	I'm feeling the pressure. I'm also trying to tone up because I want to prepare myself for the night life when I'm old enough (in 4 months!) and I want to be considered good game haha :]|`|0xz8mR2xaa	I feel internal pressure. I think of my body, and tell myself maybe I could fit into more interesting clothing and not mind mirrors if I were slimmer. I'm actually average-weight and just cursed with a very definable male build, but I still like to think that shedding a few pounds would lessen it.       The media certainly exerts it, too, though.|`|qB3hMFPVaa	meeeee|`|w9cYBmiVaa	I'm trying to lose a ton of weight by summer and have been going to the gym like everyday and doing the wii fit and occasionaly skipping meals. I feel like i would accept myself more if i was thin and might have a better chance at getting a girlfriend or boyfriend.|`|oDdXpghDaa	I wouldn't say it's pressure to be thin when you get a bit older - then it's pressure to be muscley.      It's all B.S. though - that may be what porn and advertisements think you should look like - but have a look around at other people your age... I'm sure the result will be comforting.    That being said, fit guys do get laid more often...
3rdXOSLVaa	Most religions are basically very good at their heart, but most of the people who claim to follow them don't follow the rules of their faith. So no, all religions are not bad....just the people who follow them blindly.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	Every religion has its flaws, so every religion is bad, but every religion has its greatnesses, so every religion is good.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	You are wrong. This world is in the mess it's in right now because of the non believers and not because of the Christians. It is evil that is destroying lives, not Christianity. Those religions that do not teach the true Word of God from the KJV Bible are the ones who are bad.

N5ubpPxcaa	No body on this website can answer this for you. Actually, no body in the world can but you. This is the hardest part of it all. Now that you've started asking, you have to look at your life, your relationships with people and really try to figure out what you like doing. Its a good idea to go to college and explore these things even if you haven't found out by senior year. The important thing is that you search. As you said, you're the best person you can be, at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much money you rake in, its how good of a person you are, and whatever your job may be, how you interact with those around you.   Don't stress about it, just start asking yourself these questions, and look to see the answers.|`|FZ0hwowaaa	Sounds like you do have the talent...please be positive...focus on geography if its your favorite.

TMb076n6aa	Read this     the prophet Samual had the very similar experience.    God does speak occasionally. But he desires a more heart to heart relationship through His word.    However only seek to know Jesus Christ and read the bible    Jesus died for you so you would be saved|`|tx4bRDrXaa	We would always want to investigate the truth and that only comes from God's word the Bible.God does not communicate with humans anymore.We have his word the Bible and that is all we need.2 Timothy 3;16  However there are other spirit creatures that try to communicate with us and mislead us.    These are called demons.Revelation 12:9,12  To mislead people the demons use spiritism.  One way of this is trying to find out about the future.Galatians 5:19-21  Some forms of this is thru astrology,tarot cards,omens or signs in dreams.    Acts 16:16-18 Deuteronomy 18:9-13  Sometimes the demons encourage people to inquire of the dead.Demons can actually imitate the voice of a dead person.But the Bible says the dead are conscience of nothing at all.Ecclesiastes 9:5    How to resist these wicked forces are to   Get rid of spiritistic items,study the Bible and pray to God for protection.  Wicked spirits not only mislead people but frighten them.Acts 19:19 A person should get rid of anything related to spiritism such as  books,magazines,music,movies posters,amulets or other items worn for protection.1 Corinthians 10:21  Ephesians 6:12 This doesn't make one a bad person because the devil tempted Jesus.  Mark 1:13 Matthew 6:13 Revelation 12:9  James 4:7,8  Proverbs 18:10 call on the true God and use his name Exodus 6:3 and you should not have any more problems.  Proverbs 21-9|`|zMcHYQeBaa	If you hear from God, you will have no doubt that it is Him and He will be very clear in what He wants you to know. He mostly communicates through His Word so perhaps it was your conscience calling you or your inner self (we all have one)|`|AA11220299	If you are wise you will forget the voices and trust in God's Word.|`|ebxwADDcaa	just because you hear a voice and no one called you means God is trying to contact you. but if you hear it again try to respond    here's the thing though: the stories in the bible were not always true to their word. they were written to in the end prove a point. just because you read that God talked to someone in the Bible doesnt necessarily mean that he actually spoke, but rather someone saw the chance to do the right thing or something.     then again, who am I to interpret the bible?|`|CuhJRewLaa	all theese people saying that you'll know if god is talking to you, thats not always true     i seem to recall a bible story where god called a young man three times and each time he didnt know who called him|`|91e5ab06749cb3c6be245423f175e2a0aa	If you are open to hearing, you'll KNOW when God speaks to you.  Just be patient, and keep praying.      Were there any similarities between the times that you heard the voice?|`|6AT498UTaa	There is one way to know God and it is through realizing you are a sinner and you need him and the atonement and if you pray for God's forgiveness through Jesus Christ you will receive the Holy Spirit and will be guided in a relationship with him..and you will KNOW him and his truth.|`|04f345ca740404026090acf2b474e49caa	Either it was God, Satan, or your mind.  You need to do some serious prayer and seek God out for answers.  God will not disappoint if you seek him.
AA11287948	The invention of the printing press in the late 1400s sparked the first printed editions of the Greek New Testament.  One of the earliest of these was done by Erasmus (begun in April 1515, completed in March of 1516).  Others adapted Erasmus text and it eventually became the foundation of the so-called Textus Receptus (TR).  Unfortunately Erasmus edition was based on only about six Greek manuscripts, all very late and all of the Byzantine text type.  The oldest of these was from the 10th century.  There are a number of important problems with the TR.  A few of these include:   (1) 1 John 5:7-8, the so-called three-witnesses text was not found in any of Erasmus manuscripts (though it appeared in the Latin Vulgate), so Erasmus left it out of his first edition.  When he was criticized for this omission, he said that if anyone showed him a Greek manuscript with this text in it he would include it.  One appeared shortly after (almost certainly prepared for Erasmus benefit).  Only three Greek manuscripts have this very questionable reading: one from the sixteenth century, one from the seventeenth century and one  in margin of a twelth century text (in a 17th century style of handwriting).  (2)  Erasmus occasionally introduced words from the Latin Vulgate which are not found in any Greek manuscript (cf. Acts 9.6)  (3) Erasmus only had one manuscript  of Revelation (copied in the 12th century), but it was missing the last six verses.  He therefore translated from Latin back into Greek.  This has resulted in the odd situation that there are several words in the Textus Receptus at the end of Revelation that do not appear in any Greek manuscript.    Oh another thing, no english translation is currently based off the majority Greek text.

9q7MZUpeaa	Hey there Sam,  I like your question. I know of a handful of guys who are very 'camp' and are homosexual. These guys are actually taking the normal amount, if not more, testosterone as they were born in the wrong body.     These guys were born female, and are taking a lot of testosterone every week even though they are really camp and flamboyant. Some transgender guys are taking testosterone and are really masculine and far from camp.     It literally depends on the person, not on the hormones. I couldn't think of a better example to answer your question and I hope it helps to give you some insight on your curiosity with testosterone. I guess we'll never know the true cause of campness and masculinity.

I don't mean to be offensive, but does writing "I don't mean to be offensive" really work to enable you to say whatever you want, however offensive (regardless of what you say) and get away with it?

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Hades at a Glance    name | Hades (AidhV)    role | god of the Underworld and ruler of the dead    symbols | sceptre, cornucopia     Hades in Greek Mythology   Hades was the ruler of the Greek Underworld (which itself is sometimes confusingly referred to as "Hades" also). In mythology, he was the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, and therefore from the first generation of Olympian gods. And the manner in which Hades became the lord of the shadowy Underworld is worth mentioning.     According to the myth, the three sons of Kronos and Rhea - Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades - each drew lots to determine which part of the world they would rule. Zeus and Poseidon received the sky and the seas respectively, and Hades was therefore left with the Underworld.     Hades ruled the realm of the dead alone. That is, until he became enamored of the beautiful goddess Persephone. The legend of how Persephone became the bride of Hades and the Queen of the underworld is told in the Hymn to Demeter. Although the relationship between Hades and Persephone appears to have begun badly - Hades abducted his future bride and whisked her away in a chariot - their union was peaceful (unlike the marriage of his brother Zeus...).     Hades was identified with Dis (Dis Pater) in Roman mythology.     Hades and the Underworld   Since Hades was the ruler of the Underworld, it makes sense to note one of the key features of this region - its myriad rivers. These rivers each had names and symbolic meanings:     Acheron | river of sadness     Cocytus | river of lamentation     Lethe | river of forgetfulness     Phlegethon | river of fire     Styx | river of hate|`|61ddfb6410cdb1fde97533401cf0a601aa	He is handsome, wealthy, sexy God...    and he is in love with Persephone.    In his Underworld, there were many Pervs and luxury things...    Darkness, with beautiful things in there...      He is a good God...  not evil.|`|w0ZVqqESaa	Hades (from Greek ??, Hads, originally ??, Haids or ???, Aids, probably from Proto-Indo-European *n?-wid- 'unseen'[1]) refers both to the ancient Greek underworld, the abode of Hades, and to the god of the underworld. Hades in Homer referred just to the god; the genitive ?, Haidou, was an elision to denote locality: "[the house/dominion] of Hades". Eventually, the nominative, too, came to designate the abode of the dead.    In Greek mythology, Hades and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated the Titans and claimed rulership over the universe ruling the underworld, sky, and sea, respectively; the land was given to all three concurrently. Because of his association with the underworld, Hades is often interpreted as a grim figure.    Hades was also called Pluto (from Greek ? Ploutn), and by this name known as "the unseen one", or "the rich one". In Roman mythology, Hades/Pluto was called Dis Pater and Orcus. The corresponding Etruscan god was Aita. The symbols associated with him are The Helm of Darkness and the three-headed dog, Cerberus|`|utsBDoffaa	he had no powers but he was the god of the underworld|`|WNB4Vojsaa	to leap tall buildings in a single bound.     to conjugate latin, german, and chinese while being struck by lightning bolts.    and other things.|`|464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	More than any of the Greek gods, Hades seemed to respect women and was willing to participate in a marriage of equals, sharing his decision-making powers with his wife. The two of them functioned well as a team.     Hades appears to have had three major responsibilities in running the day-to-day operation of the Underworld. The first was to prevent escapes, or returns to the earth, by the dead. In this he was assisted by a ferocious three-headed dog named Cerberus,    Another responsibility of Hades was meting out punishment. While Hades was naturally fearsome to behold because of his association with death, and was not a particularly merciful god, he was perceived as being just and fair.    Finding just the right punishment to fit the crime was not a job that most would have envied, but Hades did it well, coming up with countless creative sentences that enliven Greek mythology. Perhaps the most famous was the punishment of Sisyphus.     Hades acted as  Judges of the Dead in the Underworld.    In his role as Good Counselor, Hades was responsible for helping those who had died to make a successful transition into the afterlife, introducing them to the riches of a life lived subjectively and internally, away from the distractions of the external world. Hades teaches us to be quiet at times, listening carefully to the inner voices that direct us to the hidden riches buried deeply within the soul.|`|M6NDp9BGaa	he is the god of the underworld. no powers though other than the usual god stuff like strength|`|0dbFAyniaa	ruler of the underworld... all gods could shapeshift, see the future, and were faster, stronger, etc... than mortals|`|HhPgZDDzaa	I'm not sure of any "powers" but he was the keeper of the underworld.

This essential part is often referred to as the spirit or soul, the "higher" or "true" self, "divine spark", or "I". According to such beliefs, a new personality is developed during each life in the physical world, but some part of the self remains constant throughout the successive lives.    Belief in reincarnation has ancient roots. This doctrine is a central tenet within the majority of Indian religious traditions, such as Hinduism (including Yoga, Vaishnavism, and Shaivism), Jainism, and Sikhism. The idea was also entertained by some ancient Greek philosophers. Many modern Pagans also believe in reincarnation as do some New Age movements, along with followers of Spiritism, practitioners of certain African traditions, and students of esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalah, Sufism and Gnostic and Esoteric Christianity. The Buddhist concept of Rebirth although often referred to as reincarnation differs significantly from the Hindu-based traditions and New Age movements in that there is no unchanging "soul" (or eternal self) to reincarnate.    During recent decades, a significant minority of people in the West have developed a belief in reincarnation. Feature films, such as Kundun and Birth, contemporary books by authors such as Carol Bowman and Vicki Mackenzie, as well as popular songs, regularly mention reincarnation.    Some researchers, such as Professor Ian Stevenson, have explored the issue of reincarnation and published evidence of children's memories of earlier lives in peer-reviewed journals and elsewhere. Skeptics are critical of this work and say that more reincarnation research is needed.    >>    Vinh beat me to the punch...|`|PP0hNckuaa	try googling it :D    yours truly  tobolita  http://doubleu3x.blogspot.com/|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Reincarnation is the belief that based on your doings in this life that you will be reborn as something else in another life.

"Reincarnation is the cycle of death and rebirth after a while in spiritual spheres into a new physical body. Such a rebirth is called reincarnation. The soul - the true self - remains the same, while the "vehicle" of the soul to make the needed learning experience changes. Death means nothing else but the loss of ONE vehicle the soul was using during its many reincarnations in a physical body. Incarnation in a physical body is needed to go through certain spiritual lessons a soul may need on a particular planet. Reincarnations are controlled by the law of Karma. The family, time, place, social society and culture where a reincarnation takes place is decided by the individual Karma of a soul. It finally is a free choice of that soul because it may be necessary to become a free soul. However sometimes reincarnation is dependant on desires, fears and attachment only and rebirth or reincarnation takes places in accordance with these factors as a result of spiritual ignorance. Most of the time a reincarnation is caused by ignorance of spiritual truth and by Karma. All lessons to be learned could also be learned much easier and in a more loving atmosphere in spiritual universes. There are but a few lessons, like conducting war, abuse of might, violence of any kind including mental violence by thoughts that may require a physical incarnation because here on the physical plane the damage is relative to the physical plane and least compared to a possible damage in astral or causal spheres.     When death occurs, the soul - also called Atman - including all other bodies of lights, i.e. astral body, causal body is leaving the physical body and withdraws all connection to it. A human without physical body has the same consciousness and awareness as before in his physical body. In fact the consciousness normally is clearer and the perception of his surrounding is more accurate with the use of all metaphysical senses than in is previous physical body."|`|N9VN9bwfaa	Some people believe that upon death the soul leaves the body and enters a new body.  Some say that there is an endless cycle of births with the spirit or soul moving from lower forms such as worms up to higher animals such as birds to higher and higher forms like people and eventually to deities.  In India there are many deities such as Varuna, Mitra, Shiva, Parvati, Ganesha, and so on, and even they participate in the cycle of rebirth.  So, while the gods live for a very long time, even they die eventually.  But that belief is not universal.    Others believe that each soul must experience all things, so the soul will be born into all different forms in a more random fashion, some good and some bad, some high and some low.  And still others believe that it is one's deeds that determine how one will be reborn.  This is the doctrine of karma.  If you are good in this life, you will be reborn to a status that is higher.  If you are evil in this life, you will be reborn to a status that is lower.  In Buddhism, the belief is that the greatest salvation is to seek release from this endless cycle of rebirth.  That is nirvana.

This essential part is often referred to as the spirit or soul, the "higher" or "true" self, "divine spark", or "I". According to such beliefs, a new personality is developed during each life in the physical world, but some part of the self remains constant throughout the successive lives.    Belief in reincarnation has ancient roots. This doctrine is a central tenet within the majority of Indian religious traditions, such as Hinduism (including Yoga, Vaishnavism, and Shaivism), Jainism, and Sikhism. The idea was also entertained by some ancient Greek philosophers. Many modern Pagans also believe in reincarnation as do some New Age movements, along with followers of Spiritism, practitioners of certain African traditions, and students of esoteric philosophies such as Kabbalah, Sufism and Gnostic and Esoteric Christianity. The Buddhist concept of Rebirth although often referred to as reincarnation differs significantly from the Hindu-based traditions and New Age movements in that there is no unchanging "soul" (or eternal self) to reincarnate.    During recent decades, a significant minority of people in the West have developed a belief in reincarnation. Feature films, such as Kundun and Birth, contemporary books by authors such as Carol Bowman and Vicki Mackenzie, as well as popular songs, regularly mention reincarnation.    Some researchers, such as Professor Ian Stevenson, have explored the issue of reincarnation and published evidence of children's memories of earlier lives in peer-reviewed journals and elsewhere. Skeptics are critical of this work and say that more reincarnation research is needed.|`|RmcgrPMOaa	When someone believes in reincarnation, it means that they believe people live multiple lifetimes. It's often categorized as having to do with people coming back over and over until they resolve issues - like a wheel of life that keeps turning. Some people believe that you can eventually cease to reincarnate when you have completed all that is necessary. =]

oY4vwdjVaa	I don't remember waiting outside a church and when mass was over - dragging some man to the back, beat him and then leave him for dead inside of a trashcan.  -  note: that little old lady hardly got touched. I've been spit on, beat up, and have had horrible profanities yelled at me. All that bigot got was her ugly sign torn away from her.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	What old lady did we attack? Ann Coulter? No...that's too good to be true. You mean the old lady who got the cross snatched from her hands? Oh yes, that attack was brutal. She spent all of ZERO hours in the hospital after that brutal homo-assault.    Look - the 'homosexual community' didn't act violently. I'm a homosexual, and I did nothing. I live in Ohio - it's too cold for violence. There very well may be some violent gay people doing some bad things, but that's not the 'gay community'.    You may now thank me for informing you.    To the Ann Coulter lover: if you love her so much then marry her - God knows no one else will.    Again to the Ann Coulter lover: When she used that anti-gay slur, that was all I needed to hear from her to understand where she stood.    For the LAST time to the Ann Coulter lover: Whether I've said it or not (and I honestly don't think I have - I don't like that word) hearing it come from her 'Christian' lips is another matter entirely. Besides, most communities that have a slur used against them take the slur and use it themselves - in an attempt (effective or not) to take back their own power. I'm Black, so I see this all the time with the 'N' word. There's a difference between someone within the community using the slur in a new way, and someone outside of that community using it with it's old connotations intact. (Like Ann Coulter did.)    For the LAST LAST time: Oh please. There are pet names that my mother could call me that YOU could not. I'm not discriminating against you, or hating you. I'm just understanding that she has a relationship with me that you do not and cannot. A lot of women use the 'B' word amongst one another. I will NOT go up to one of them and use it, and then get upset when SHE get's upset. I know that I am not in a position to use that term with her. She's not discriminating against men - she's understanding that words have different energy given their source. If I care for her at all, I'll not use that term.    To Eric H: You talk about 'the homosexual community' acting violently, but it wasn't 'the homosexual community'. No one is twisting what you said. Did someone else type that when you weren't looking? If not, that's what you said. By saying that, you are implying ALL of us. If a group of Black men commit a crime, and then you come to me and ask "why did the Black community do such and such" I will be upset. Do you understand that?    Be clear in your question, and specify to whom you are speaking. Is it the community, or a few individuals? It can't be both.    For the LAST LAST LAST time: LOL! We're going to debate about whether or not it's a pet name or a nickname? I didn't realize there was a difference. We don't need Dr. Phil - we need a dictionary.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	I don't think most are but when you want people to help you, pointing fingers at them and blaming them doesn't help that much.|`|GkO45d7uaa	I wouldn't say they hate more, but they sure do take it out on people. I didn't see straight people going into the gay community and attacking them in retaliation for their attacks or for it barely passing.    And to the Ann Coulter hater-- I LOVE Ann Coulter!     I would marry her if she had any idea who I was. It IS possible to be conservative and gay, just so you know. She does not speak out against the gay community, just the concept of gay marriage.    Again to you: Don't act like you've never said it.    Once again: That's called a double-standard. You're saying I can't say the N word, but you can? That, in itself, is discrimination.  I guarantee every American above the age of 14 has said it at least once.    Ugh: Really? There is a difference between a pet name and a nickname. Pet names are something you give to your lover, such as "Babe." I'm worried that your own mom gives you pet names. If you are in need of counseling, call Dr. Phil ASAP!!    Hahaha: Ok. I'm good if you're good! It was nice debating you. I got a few good laughs, so I'm hoping you did, too. You were probably like "WHAT THE HE** IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY?!"|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	If you can give me some examples of Prop 8 supporters being beaten, killed or raped by 'violent homosexuals' maybe I would take your question more seriously. No? Didn't think so. A few legitimately angry gay people have done some dumb stuff. We're just as capable of being idiots as anyone else. But to compare it to the violence and discrimination faced by gay people is ridiculous.|`|KBBonf97aa	I suspect that if you looked at percentages, you'd find the number of anti-gay people propelled from bed every morning by their hatred is about even with the number of hostile gays with similar-but-opposite motivations.  I think there are just huge numbers of negative people, both gay and straight.  The most extreme homophobes seem to think all gays are like the ones you see on Mardi Gras floats decked out in rainbow gear and wearing chaps without pants.  And the gays who go around trashing Christianity and other faiths that don't support homosexuality seem to equate all who oppose pro-gay legislation with the people they see holding "GOD HATES GAYS" signs.  I guess I feel fortunate that the majority of people on both sides of the issue don't buy into the stereotypes.  But it's always the loudmouths who are mistaken for leaders of any cause, whether they have many followers or not.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	"Anti-Gays" as you call them (bigots, as I call them) hate for no reason.  Gay folks hate in retaliation of other hate.    Leave us alone, we'll leave you alone.  No problem.  Attack us, and we'll attack back.

I personally disapprove of them, they won't do anything.    But I seriously find it funny how people say that gay people are "intolerant" and "hateful" because they are protesting Prop 8. Funny because all and up to that point it was the other way around.    See, it's mostly anti-gay people who are hateful and intolerant. One "intolerant" and "hateful" act by gay people does NOT tip the scale. But of course, anti gays are saying it is. Anti gays will be intolerant and hateful and justify those actions in every way possible and then when a gay person does it, like little children, they're like, "See! Gay people say we're intolerant but now THEY are being intolerant!"    EDIT: What is the purpose for asking this question?

0ufpOygTaa	First you must have a definition of what good and evil is.    Being it is the nature of man to think and as a consequence able to defy what is simply dictated by instinct we act and do things unnaturally - meaning what is not common to other animals.    Now if that to you is evil or good according to your own definition then that what man is. Ah, philosophy - another quality unique to humans.|`|1hS27eJuaa	people are not naturally good, look at are primal instincts, were greedy and murderous by nature.|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Good, or evil is not natural.

The problem is that sometimes people are misled, but I honestly don't believe that anyone sets out to be bad. And, if you really watch people, for the most part they try to help other people, and depend on each other. I have faith in mankind, all they need is exposure and education.|`|L4eoLmvJaa	depends on the person|`|EJSdI25Naa	It is more a culture of learning. Gypsies in Italy would strip a tourist blind, but that is their occupation. I soon learned to cuss them away when I saw them approaching me. you can give all the love and attention to your pet dog, but if another dog comes near your pet will snarl and bark ferociously. It is not going to share its place in the world with anybody.    People are not one or the other, but they are both. Yourself and myself included. We have to acknowledge these psychological aspects of ourselves and avoid falling into the abyss of depression because of them.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	Neither. "Good" and "evil" are subjective.    Humans are animals, and are born as such. It's in our nature to be affectionate to our family and those who live peacefully with us, which may be considered "good." But it is also animal nature to value oneself above all else, which may be "evil" to some.    It's through upbringing that we grow to be capable of "good" and "evil," because those very concepts are things that we are taught as we become socialized. Without being taught about them, we'd be just as good or bad as the next ape.|`|PLZrvfFEaa	I'm naturally evil! Mwahahahaha!

Like Gul Ducat in Star Trek Next Generation when he was torturing  Picard. He was totally evil and sadistic. But then he was shown being very tender and sweet to his young daughter. So he was probably a good dad who happened to be a sadistic torturer.|`|AA10556726	I think that most people are naturally empathetic.  While there are some that actually have no sense of morals, most people do.  However, morality and norms are very relative to the larger society and to the social group that one belongs to.  For example most of us follow general social norms, but in a group of tight friend or a gang, that smaller, closer group takes precedence.|`|E9chZY74aa	Predispositioned to be selfish.|`|7y6yfrQlaa	naturally good but somewhere along the line they lose their sanity|`|jOwH96wKaa	Hmm, or are we a tabula rosa?    I'd have to say natural evil. People do things that are bad but only because society hasn't taught them such.    For instance, little kid will torture doggie because he thinks it's fun. It's up to his parents to teach him that it's bad.|`|p4hWHIN9aa	Naturally human, and built to be good. Evil is a choice, and one that deteriorates people. Pay attention to evil people, if you notice they eventually lose their minds.|`|ebxwADDcaa	we all started naturally bad, then got better for a while, and now we are getting worse again.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	There is no "good" or "bad" in anybody unless it is planted and nurtured into them by others.|`|E3v6Ctffaa	Good and evil does not exist , it is only concepts.    Theres is a lot of factors to consider , Parents , Education , Society , how did this person grew up , what was is thinking patterns and such.  How much knowledge did he had , could he access it or he lived in a very controlled area like China and such.    So naturally humans tend to be evil ( in the sense they will do things in their favor while ignoring or simply not realising the consequences of their actions on others for their own happiness )|`|wNA3EqKcaa	Everyone has a conscience toward Goodness. There is a lot of evidence for this, and common sense backs it up. For example, while specific moral codes may vary between cultures, there has never been a culture where it's been admirable to steal, run away from battle, hurt a child, or kill a friend. No matter how isolated a culture is or what time period it was in, their morality is recognizable. There's a constant. Another daily example would be someone cutting you in line. If someone cuts you in line and you argue with him about it, he's not going to stand up for the general concept of cutting. He may argue about why, in this circumstance, it's allowable or good for him to cut, but both of you will automatically accept the common moral doctrine that line-cutting is, for some reason, wrong.     On the other hand, people tend toward self-centeredness. The man may justify cutting in line because he's running late or because you've cut him previously; he is, above all, concerned with himself. You do the same thing, of course. Your instinct isn't to think about whether it's OK to let him skip you in line in the circumstances. Your instinct isn't to think about how he can benefit from being closer to the front of the line. You think about yourself first.    So we as people have these two things inside of us: 1) a moral code where we all know, generally, what is good or not, and 2) an instinct toward egoism, which may be in conflict with our naturally good conscience.     The most virtuous man is one who 1) knows what is good, and 2) is inclined toward goodness. Most people succeed on the first point. Most people fall on the second point. The difference between good and evil people (or actions) is whether you make an effort to align your actions with your good conscience, even and especially when it conflicts with your inclination.    I interpret these to think that while people are naturally good, we also have a naturally tendency to fall from goodness. The key to being truly good is resisting and fighting against the tendency to act in a way that is contrary to your natural good conscience.|`|H1zS1enMaa	I THINK ALL PPL ARE NATURALLY GOOD BUT THAT DEVIL STARTS PLAYING WITH THEYR MINDS THEN IF THEY LET HIM THEY BECOME EVIL AND DO EVIL THINGS!|`|cp7regataa	There is good in everyone but sometimes evil takes over.

k03dYskYaa	The Hebrew terms relating to integrity (tom, tummah, tam, tamim) have the root meaning of that which is complete or whole. (Compare Le 25:30; Jos 10:13; Pr 1:12.) Tamim is used several times to refer to physical completeness, or soundness, and freedom from impairment. But more frequently these terms describe moral soundness or blamelessness.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	honesty|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	A good and true character.

(And it really doesn't matter what part of the world you do this in, people will say it's wrong.) Moral standards is the code of behavior that everyone thinks people should abide by.

AA10311549	How do you define "Christian"?    One of the most loving, giving, "Christian" people I ever knew was an avowed atheist.    A Christian is one who abides in love.  "God is love, and he who abides in love, abides in God and God in him."    Christ's Church is composed of PEOPLE.  Not any institution.  It is by faith -- true faith -- in the love of Christ which signifies a Christian.  Whether you cognitively accept the existence of God or not.      Give me a "GOOD" atheist any day over a "I have taken Jesus as my savior" kind of hypocrite whose actions disprove their oath.  ======================================...

If your own personal reasons for doing this are not about religion, then I find no reason to tell them.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Interesting situation you find yourself in. I recommend that you not hint at your true beliefs, but instead suggest that the organization tries to do a Christian/Atheist Alliance for the betterment of the community. You could use the reasoning "that in doing so, it would show true devotion to your beliefs if you can work with someone that completely disagrees with you for the betterment of others. If the idea flows well, then you can begin contacting Atheist community activists, and advertising for the group. You would have to ensure that religious views do not cause problems within the group, and that it is for the selfless betterment of the community."    If this works out, you can then begin to show your true views. But even if they are not pleased, you will have done much to bring a community together despite religious differences for a common good, and that is really saying something.

2BBKHggeaa	We need Jesus "Like we need air to breath"     I like your point. It makes sense. People who believe that Jesus is God are forgetting that 3 in 1 involves only one third worship for each one.      God wants exclusive devotion. ( Ex.20:5;Mt 22:37)  In order for God to get exclusive devotion you'd have to knock the other 2 off the tri-pod, or in other words accept that Jesus and the holyspirit are not God.   Any devotion or worship going to any of the other 2  besides God himself,will immediatly cut the worship in parts....you can't get around it.    The same would apply for being polytheistic, God wants exclusive devotion making the other two equals lesser.      Bottom line.  Jesus is important because he is God's first born son, and through him all other things were made.He is our ransomer. He is our means of salvation. God gave Jesus the Kingdom to judge and Jesus will give it back to his father after the thousand years.      Jesus is not God, and is subordinate to God.  The holy spirit is God's active force. The trinity is not believable and is disrespectful to God who true worship belongs.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27.

2OeWXloQaa	When I was about 11 or 12 I was about 5'6. I was sooo much taller then everyone else. At that age everyone teased me. My nick name was Jolly Green Giant, or monster. I'm now 15. I've gotten to be 5'8 and I've completely stopped growing. Everyone is taller then me. It's wonderful.  But that wasn't really the answer you were looking for.  I think tall guys are hott. The taller the better. There's this one kid in my biology class that's 6'6 and I think that it's extremely attractive so don't feel bad. =]|`|qjvAquFnaa	when i was 5' 10' at 16.

But while i live under my parents roof i cannot smoke. So i have to suffer and do snus. But hey if you do try them get Frost thats there best flavor. The spice taste nasty and like a pumpkin.

LfIw9R0iaa	The majority of racism in America today comes from people of minority groups.  Political correctness allows them to get away with things that whites would be crucified for and this is why we have the double standard.  A perfect example of what I am talking about is all the answers that you have recieved which claim that it's natural for people to want to be around their own kind.  It might be natural, but it is still racist behavior and if a white person where to have done this, they would be instantly labeled a racist because of it.  However, in this instance it's ok because it was a minority discriminating againt a white person.|`|ncdTxID9aa	Double Standards just fuel race wars.

He won't let you down or leave you.|`|nOVyrsl4aa	I agree that counseling will help you transition better into the adult world...look into it|`|MkQWnA22aa	I agree with the poster that mentioned counseling.  I think many of us have felt overwhelmed or anxious with all the responsibilities life can throw at you. If it is becoming overwhelming, you should talk with your doctor and a counselor.  Best wishes.|`|wRsSodTAaa	Unfortunately, in this life, stress is inevitable.  However, when we are rejected we know that even Jesus was rejected too.  Just think about it... if the very son of God was rejected, it is not far-fetched that we would be also.  But if that is the worst that happens to you in your life, then, (not to belittle your problem) but you are doing pretty good.      I understand the stressors of becoming an adult, as I was married at the early age of 20.  But, with time, you learn how to cope.  Just take it step by step and don't be so hard on yourself.  You are secure in Christ.  He loves you and fully accepts you for who you are.      God bless you.  |`|AABCy5mQaa	Forget everyone in life. You are on this journey, your path, alone. Forget making friends and all that stuff. Enjoy the company you have in your life and if more come along, let it happen naturally. You shouldnt force it. Find the faith and self confidence in yourself, so that you dont have to depend on your relationships with others, to make you feel satisfied. When things get tough, take it as a test. Are you strong..... or weak? Will you pass..... or fail? When things get tough , I like to remind myself of all the unfortunate situations so many others are in, that are so much worse than mine. It kinda makes you just be greatful for what you have , and get over the petty difficulties. You will be alright. If anything, this time for you will make you stronger. But do not whimper and complain about it. Take it face up, with your head high, and know that everything happens for a reason. And that this is just a moment in time...it will pass.|`|isll2Uqnaa	"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.

I have overcome the world. John 16:33    sometimes the only thing that keeps me from going crazy is knowing that God is in control of everything. put everything in His hands, He cares more about your situation than you know. its only when we acknowledge that we cant do it ourselves that He can begin to work in our lives.

Here are some Bible verses to look up that may help you: Proverbs 3:5,6;  Romans 10:13, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8, John 3:16, Philippians 4:6,7.

I found that walking by faith is the surest way to happiness.  Draw closer to the Lord and pray constantly.  I know the devil would love to destroy you and me too but we can find that place of peace in Christ and not worry about friendships so much but ask the Lord to help us with friendships and expenses, and getting our lives together.  God bless you!!!|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Take a deep breath and hang in there ..|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Hi there.    Genesis 2: 7:    And Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a "LIVING SOUL".  -----------------------------    You questioner, are a living soul; just like Adam; just like me and every other human.  -----------------------------    Don't worry either, because we all go through what you do. It's hard to trust anyone in today's world, but we keep plugging away. For instance, I did the part about meeting a very good friend about 5 months ago. Now she is my caregiver and I trust her utmostly because she's proven herself and also told me when she first met me that she hoped that she could gain a friend; a genuine friendship. She has told me most all of her deepest secrets and some of mine I've told her also.    Now for the struggling part; today my internet service and cable was turned off. I thought I paid the bill over a week ago but they said my bank account came back NSF so I went in to check out my bank today. It had over $462 in deficit?? It was from a charge that I did not authorize a while back that a company snuck in and charged anyway, so all of my payments I made are all coming back NSF and obviously I don't have the money, so I was able to borrow some money just to get my internet/phone/cable services back up and going. Just an extra bill I have and with my disability money now, it's so very hard.    I am not able to do the things I used to do, but nonetheless, I am still here. I just had surgery and require more; oh well, such as life.    Anyway, what I am saying is you're not alone and you can overcome, it's just that some days are better than others and we have to take them when we get them and cherish them --- tightly.    One day soon however, we won't have to struggle and work our fingers to the bone because we will all own our houses and no one can take them away and we will not have to work for money because Jehovah God says so. If you can hang on a little while longer and pray for endurance to make you stronger, and to keep putting up just a bit longer, you too will share in the new system free from stress, strife, toiling and laboring for money that is taken from you, free from crime, free from illness, free from sin but the last sin to be removed is death. We will not grow old and die.    You will have some bad days, but you've got quite a heavy load at this time. Some days will be much better, but life is not a fairytale. You will eventually find friends that you can trust who are on the "same level" as you are. We go through life and sometimes when I thought I'd found a friend, it turned out to be anything but; now I have just two friends that I love and cherish very much; I have patience with them as do they with me, and I don't expect too much except their honesty, love and forgiveness. I have that with them and everything else falls into place.    Prayer to Jehovah God also helps me. You will survive and ask Jehovah for a true blue friend. If your heart is in the right place, he will deliver because having a true blue, loving, trustworthy friend is within Jehovah God's will.

No need to pay for daycare, when she can provide it.  3 more children in your house at a rate of $100-$125 a week is an income of $1200-$1500 a month, with your only out of pocket expense being breakfast, lunch, and a snack.  Quality daycare is hard to find, especially for a reasonable rate.  But you have to be dedicated to it.|`|irLnPW4aaa	How about a job in the evening, overnight or on the weekend so that Daycare wouldn't be necessary?  If the wife got a job when the husband is at home to be with the children, she could get by with either less hours or lower pay since she wouldn't have to cover daycare expenses.

Don't take it personal.  She just has her own demons to deal with.    Don't let her lie become your reality.  Stay grounded in the TRUTH!|`|KEwIn1lPaa	yes it is .  it is some form of sexual intimacy|`|3aVxJYf6aa	FORNICATION    Illicit sex relations outside of Scriptural marriage. The Hebrew verb zanah and its related forms convey the idea of harlotry, immoral intercourse, fornication, or prostitution. (Ge 38:24; Ex 34:16; Ho 1:2; Le 19:29) The Greek word translated fornication is porneia. Regarding the meanings of porneia, B.?F. Westcott in his book Saint Pauls Epistle to the Ephesians (1906, p.?76) says: This is a general term for all unlawful intercourse, (I) adultery: Hos. ii. 2,?4 (LXX.); Matt. v.?32; xix. 9; (2) unlawful marriage, I Cor. v.?I; (3) fornication, the common sense as here [Eph 5:3]. Bauers Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament (revised by F.?W. Gingrich and F.?Danker, 1979, p. 693) defines porneia as prostitution, unchastity, fornication, of every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse. Porneia is understood to involve the grossly immoral use of the genital organ(s) of at least one human; also there must have been two or more parties (including another consenting human or a beast), whether of the same sex or the opposite sex. (Jude 7) The unlawful act of a rapist is fornication, but, of course, that does not make the person who is forcibly raped also a fornicator.    When God performed the first human marriage he said: That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh. (Ge 2:24) Here the standard set for man and woman was monogamy, and promiscuous sex relationship was ruled out. Also, no divorce and remarriage to another was anticipated.See DIVORCE.    In patriarchal society Gods faithful servants hated fornication, whether between single, engaged, or married persons, and it was considered a sin against God.Ge 34:1, 2, 6, 7,?31; 38:24-26; 39:7-9.|`|tQW18Kspaa	Yup  That's what it means  and it's probably still on the Books  Cohabitation just left the Books in the last   10-15 years  It was against the law to live with(not married)  the opposite sex.|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	Yes, I always thought it was. God wants us to have married sex.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Absolutely!  (From premarital to homosexual.)  It is ALL fornication!|`|5JQFCQCkaa	Yes, that is one meaning of it, but there are several others. For instance, occasionally adultery is counted. In some case masturbation is also a correct term. Then again, it can just mean sex in general.  It doesn't have one definitive meaning.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	any sex that is outside the marriage between one man and one woman is fornication.|`|7d49ddbf3b36edeb5a77c20235621a44aa	consensual sexual intercourse between to people outside of marriage.  yes unless you were to consider adultery as a form of fornication then it's a matter of semantics.|`|0FXVTZf7aa	No.  There are two words that are translated as fornication in the New Testament.  Porneia is the 1st word but it is only described as incest (1 Cor 5:1) and prostitution (1 Cor 6:13-16).  The second word is Porneuo and it is only described as Sexual Idolatry (1 Cor 10:8).    Everything else they tell you these words mean is simply academic theories that cannot be proven.

Hebrews 4:11-13 (New King James Version)    The Word Discovers Our Condition       11 Let us therefore be diligent to enter that rest, lest anyone fall according to the same example of disobedience. 12 For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. 13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.

There followed numerous image macros with the format "Ceiling Cat is watching you [verb ending in/rhyming with -ate]" with Ceiling Cat superimposed in the upper left hand corner of an image macro depicting the appropriate action. The character is also featured in a project to translate the Bible to lolspeak. "Ceiling Cat" and the corresponding "Basement Cat" (a black cat who lives in the basement) have been said to represent God and Satan in the lolcat universe.[24][25][26]"|`|jdKOejikaa	Kitten Elimination shall return to eat the kittahs!|`|urQQ6kbcaa	The ceiling cat is heavenly|`|gAzb5PAbaa	Oh hai.

All are creations of the imaginations of fallen souls who have rejected the true deity...the first and original deity...the great and glorious J.R. 'Bob' Dobbs.    Yea of little faith and overflowing litter boxes should repent right now and ask both Bob and the anti-Virgin Connie for forgiveness. Or at least pray and ask for a year's supply of Tidy Cat Kitty Litter.

Regardless of whether or not what He chose to do is 'fair', it *is*. 'Fair' is irrelevant to truth.     He created me with a purpose, and I'm not going to sit here questioning why. I am going to devote my entire life to fulfilling that purpose as best I can. I am going to glorify him with my life; after all, He *made* me; who am I to question His authority?|`|q0LMxKcjaa	Let's go back to the beginning......in the Garden of Eden.  Adam and Eve had perfect fellowship with God.  But.... when Adam and Eve sinned by DISOBEYING GOD (eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil after God told them not to) that perfect relationship and fellowship was broken.  (Sin separates us from God.)  The spiritual part of Adam and Eve died that day.  Sin entered into the "bloodline" of mankind that day.   And all who would be born after them would be sinners'  (In Romans 3:23 the Bible says, "For ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."    But God, being all-knowing...knew before He ever created anything that man would sin, and in Revelation it says that Jesus Christ was "slain before the foundation of the world."  God had a wonderful plan to send His Son here to this earth.  You see....the Bible says that "the wages (or penalty for) of sin is DEATH, but the GIFT of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Jesus Christ WILLINGLY took your place on the cross ( and mine and all of mankind)  ... He paid your sin debt... he died in your place because he loves us all so much.  We must believe that Jesus is God's Son, and that he paid our debt...he died in our place. .....confess that you are a sinner,  and ask him to forgive your sins and come into your heart and be your Lord and Savior.  When you do that.....the Spiritual relationship with God is restored...the Bible says that God.....the creator of everything....adopts us into his family....we become a child of God.   He wipes that slate clean....forgives ALL of your sins...and sends the Holy Spirit to come and live inside you and be your guide, comforter, teacher, our all.    I've been saved over 35 years....and God has never left me, forsaken me....and He promises that everything that takes place in my life...good or bad...will work together for my good and His glory.....what a Savior.......I pray these words will touch your heart and that you will come to know the One who died for you and rose again on the third day to defeat Satan...death ....hell and the grave!  He loves you so very much.......|`|HJEQv3cBaa	Original sin is something that was taken from psalms 51:5 but if you look closely it reads "in sin did my mother CONCEIVE me". You can absolutely be conceived in sin. An example would be premarital sex leading to pregnancy. If a woman is forced against her will to have sex and becomes pregnant that is also being CONCEIVED by sin the man committed the sin by forcing her against her will. Being conceived in sin is different from being born sinful. I just want to say before I continue I CARE ABOUT YOU BEING SAVED, and the reason why you want to be saved is so you can go to heaven. I want you to go to heaven plain and simple. Now with that being said All children are innocent in the eyes of God, But their is a point in time were we will all come to understand the difference between sin and righteousness as we get older and we will ALL commit sin at some point in our lives that's without a doubt we will also be held accountable, but the most important thing is to come out of that sin. And you can come out of that sin by obeying the gospel and being cleansed by the blood of Christ. If you would please send me an email about whatever biblical question you may have and I will do my best to give you a biblical answer I can also send you some tracts (for free) discussing these matters my address is wjohnson2355@yahoo.com.I would also like to send you more on this subject.|`|bYqWHuzyaa	I couldn't care less if you are saved or not buddy.|`|4boTYkt7aa	To be saved you must be baptized when you come to the age that you understand right from wrong and understand why Jesus came to earth and died for us.Then you are baptized into Jesus's death and are changed into a new person(you must be totally immersed in water)No one is born into sin.We commit sin as we grow.I hope this helps.|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	If you don't like it, don't do it.|`|PmG0Isnnaa	Because you have inherited their sinful nature and its curse of temporal and eternal death. Plus your sinful nature also results in you committing actual sins, such as questioning the "fairness" of God.  God is loving and he is just, but modern notions of "fairness" are not part of God's nature.  If God were "fair" everyone would burn forever in hell, because that is what we deserve.     Jesus, the Son of God,  died for you to pay for your sins.  Those who believe this and are baptized will be saved.  Those who don't won't.|`|1NtwIeLyaa	God's Word tells us "for ALL have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."  We all deserve hell, my friend, and out of God's immense mercy and grace, He provided a way for us to spend eternity with Him.  That Way, is Yeshua (Jesus).  It takes a conscious choice to know you need a Savior and to ask Him into your heart and life.  Without that decision, you will spend eternity in complete separation of God and all that is good.    Harmony|`|hQDapmICaa	The wages of sin is death. So, if you are sinless, you will not die. and you don't need salvation.

0NOiAlJOaa	Do you think God is unfair? Has He predestined some human beingsmade in His imageto burn in hell, with no genuine opportunity for salvation? Shockingly, this idea of a cruel and capricious God is commonly taught in the name of "Christianity." But it is wrong! Gods plan will give every human being a genuine opportunity to be saved.    Many who call themselves Christian have been unable to reconcile Gods love, mercy and justice with the idea of eternal hellfire for those who have never heard the message of Jesus Christ. Yet the Bible plainly teaches, "Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).       How can we reconcile this apparent contradiction between Gods mercy and His justice? Your Bible reveals that billions of people will have their very first opportunity for salvation in the White Throne Judgment, described in Revelation 20:1112. Gods plan of salvation may be difficult for some to believe. But it is very encouraging when you understand the hope it brings to all of humanity. Those who have suffered from their own sins in ignorance, and those who have been innocent victims of war, oppression and genocide will be resurrected to understand the Biblethe Book of Life. They will have their first true opportunity to understand Gods love for all humanity. In the White Throne Judgment, billions of human beings who were previously spiritually blinded will finally learn from the pain of the past, and they will be given the opportunity to truly repent, believe the gospel and eventually inherit the Kingdom of God. As Peter wrote, "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance" (2 Peter 3:9).        But what about those who have seared their consciences, and knowingly rejected Gods truth, love, knowledge and forgiveness in favor of rebellion, hatred and sin? These willful sinners will be burned up in a lake of fire! Notice: "Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire" (Revelation 20:1415).        Here is the second deaththe eternal death penalty from which there is no resurrection! Those who have sealed their minds never to repent or surrender to Jesus Christ will be totally burned updestroyed!        In Luke 16, the parable of Lazarus and the rich man illustrates the torment unrepentant sinners will experience before they are totally burned up. Notice that the rich man is about to be thrown into the lake of fire. Notice also that he is in hadeshe is in the grave, not in Gehenna fire. He is resurrected for final judgment, as described in Revelation 20. So what does he ask for? A drop of water to cool his tongue. He did not ask for buckets of water to be poured over him. The rich man was in deep mental torment and anguish just before his destruction. The incorrigibly wicked will suffer the torment of knowing their fate before their final execution. But a loving and merciful God will put them out of their misery for all eternity. They will be totally burned up and destroyed forever, annihilated in the lake of firea fire that will spread over the whole earth!        Yes, the whole earth will be purified by fire. "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness" (2 Peter 3:1011).        Those who have sealed their own fatewho have determined never to repent of their evil attitude and naturewill be totally burned up and will become ashes! They will not be tormented forever. They will receive their eternal punishment, not eternal punishing. Their death, their eternal punishment, will last for eternity! Many people have wondered why, if God is such a just God, He condemns people to suffer for all eternity when they have never had a real chance to hear, believe or act upon the gospel. The answer is simple: He does not do that! God is just and fair.   It is Satan and his angels who will be tormented forever. Satan wants us to believe that his fate, as a spirit being, will be the fate of humans! Satan "deceives the whole world" (Revelation 12:9). Contrary to Satans propaganda, God will not allow humans to suffer forever!     This is what the Bible teaches. The incorrigibly wicked will be totally destroyedannihilated. But they will not be destroyed capriciously, or unfairly, or because God predestined them never to hear Christs message. As we have seen, no one can be saved without accepting the message of Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12). Through the White Throne Judgment, those human beings who have not previously had their minds opened by Gods truth will have their first genuine opportunity for salvation.   So, who is burning in hell? By now you know the answer. The answer is: "No one!" There is a future lake of fire that will burn up, consume, and annihilate the wicked forever. That fire will purify the earth for the new heavens and earth promised in Revelation 21. We can all be thankful for Gods justice, fairness, and plan of salvation through Christ. There is judgment coming, but there is also hope for many of your friends and relatives you thought may have been lost!  Here is some literature that may help you to understand God's plan of salvation for mankind.......http://www.gnmagazine.org/booklets/AD/kn...|`|hMygg8cnaa	**sigh**    he doesn't send you anywhere.  when you die, you go to the grave, right?  okay, so what are you complaining about?    jesus offers you more than death.  he offers you eternal life.    you don't want it?  that's okay.  you'll die  and your soul will sit in the grave  until the end of days  when it is eternally destroyed.  it will be  as if you never existed.    and in terms of those  who never heard the gospel.  what IS the gospel?  it is the good news that God  offers salvation to you  if you have faith in His grace and mercy.    there is evidence of God  throughout the planet.  why do you think so many  primitive tribes  have a concept of God or gods?  so i would think that if a person  connects with God and has  faith in God, they will be saved.  simple as that.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Why would someone who has rejected God in this life want to spend eternity in His complete and absolute presence?|`|b04999b0e7ff207909ed958e37c605caaa	religion is a joke    if you think i am a Scientology I'm NOT    that's a joke too with all that spiritual enlightenment crap|`|aBqJhdufaa	No, it's only if you turn away from God.

"God is Love and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him"    True faith resides in our living a life of love and loving our neighbor as ourselves.    Although it is through Christ we are "saved" this does NOT mean that we must take Jesus as out personal savior" as so many so-called Christians are want to proclaim.  Our FAITH is recognized by the love in our hearts and is recognized by our life and what we do with it.  "By their fruits you shall know them."    Our "works' do not make us merit salvation but they DO signify the truth of our faith.    The Church of Christ consist of people, not any institution.  Nor does it even need for us to have ever heard of Jesus or have read the Bible.    ALL people who live a life of love are Christians whether they call themselves Christian, Catholic, Jew, Mulsim, Mormon, Hindu, Buddhist, or even atheist.|`|d1X9zICiaa	He wouldn't.|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	in this day in age - it's a VERY miniscule group t hat does not have access to CHrist.

But He does not forgive those who reject him. God gives EVERYONE a chance to hear about Christ, even in all those certain countries. He gives us a chance, but we are the ones to choose whether or not we take it.|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Look at the up side eternal torment is eternal  life but Jesus said (only the righteous will inherent eternal life) may be God was wrong ..|`|XzEGvaXjaa	Its quite simple: you cannot save someone who does not want to be saved.    God does not "send" people to Hell, people "go" to Hell. There's a difference. You see, Hell is a place where we are completely separated from God. We become separated from God each and every time we sin, and EVERYONE sins. That's what evil is, the absence of God and righteousness (like darkness is the absence of light and cold is the absence of warmth). As the Bible says, "the wages of sin is death" and this is both spiritual and physical death. In the Old Testament, to be spared from death and Hell, believers had to make an animal sacrifice to replace their own sacrifice. Non-believers died. There was simply no getting around the fact that sinning kills us because it removes us from God. When removed from God, God cannot save us. However, now we are all saved by the sacrifice that Christ made when he died for our sins...but...if you do not accept this, then you cannot be saved because God cannot make you accept it.    Well...God CAN make you accept it however he chooses not to because he has given us free will and as such, we can choose whether or not we will serve him or not. If we choose not to be saved, he isn't going to make us.    I guess what I'm trying to say is that by being saved, we are given the gift of be protected from ourselves, which is a gift that someone who is not saved can't have because they choose to reject it. Again, you cannot help someone who does not want your help.    As for people who never heard about Jesus...well...I don't know how that works honestly. Its a question I constantly hear people ask...but I have no real answer. Sorry. My mother did once tell me that if you honestly have no idea that what you're doing is a sin then you aren't sinning, but most of us have some exposure to what is considered "sins" in the Christian religion so most of us are not able to get away with that. However, for animals or mentally challenged people or people who really never heard of Christ, I suppose this would apply. But I don't know of the validity of this claim as I've never read that in the Bible myself...|`|c1wCuGzpaa	He gives us a choice.

The Bible states... You must be born again to enter into the kingdom of heaven.. If you don't accept Jesus as your personal savior then how can you enter into heaven?    You must be born again...

He said that people who have never heard of Jesus or Christianity will go to Heaven because they never learned "the truth" and decided to not believe it. The same goes to mentally handicapped people, children, etc.     This is also the reason that missionaries go to these remote areas and try to convert the indigenous people.    The way I feel about it is that if you believe in God and have a conscience then you are going to Heaven, I don't care if you are Christian, Hindu, Buddhist.|`|AA11693263	Because the Bible states that Jesus will not return until every human being has heard His word and been given the choice to be saved and find redemption through Him. It also states that when He returns that every knee will bend and every head will bow and every mouth will confess his existence. So, no one is going to be blamed for not hearing about Him because He said that everyone will hear about him.|`|9oCrDNe2aa	He doesn't send them to Hell. No one can fully understand God, but we know he is righteous and cannot tolerate sin. Virtually everyone has had the opportunity to find out about Jesus. And we don't know what happens right after we die. People who died before Jesus came on earth and died, heard Him preach during the three days he died. That's why He calls some of us to be missionaries. How would you feel if a friend died, and you never even mentioned someone who was supposed to be your best friend. And it's not just about "believing" To be a Christian, you have to follow in the footsteps of Christ. Even the demons believe.    There was a little remote village in a country that no missionaries had been too, because there were rumors about the village being cannibals. Well a couple came to the village to spread the gospel, and found out that what they believed in was almost the same. They believed there was only one true God, and that in the story, a man saved the entire village, because he died on a tree...and they saw the "tree" and it looked like a cross. It was hard to understand because the words they used were different.    God doesn't necessarily "send" people to Hell. We choose our way. There's only two choices, and we can't choose neither. All this happening in the world is exactly what the Bible said would happen.    Too bad most people are willing to try out almost everything, or fall for some false religion, and not even really get to know Jesus. They either think He's just an old man in the sky that makes up a bunch of rules, a myth, or they are against Him.    Many times people choose to follow multiple gods. It's not like they weren't given a chance. Even not believing in a deity is a form of religion.    People say that science proves everything, or that people use God to try to scare people. Well isn't it kind of urgent when you could die at any time? Not every one really knows or plans when they are going to die, especially if they are young. I don't think God is trying to scare people. He's been very patient for a long time, and works in certain peoples hearts, even though many reject Him.  How quick people are to turn away from their loving father.  But God sees the purpose, and He always makes a way.  But a time will come when every knee will bow in His Glory.    When there is so much opposition, it only affirms my faith.  And sometimes it's the generation's fault. At one time people all lived in the same area, but they branched out. Some chose not to follow God, but one boy got the opportunity to leave his village, he heard the Word, went back to his village, and led people to Christ. Look at the pilgrims...and Squanto. And the One to whom they gave thanks.    We have come so far...    It's not about being "good and living a good life"  A man could be a sinner, a thief his whole life, and at the end, if He truly repents and accepts God, he will go to Heaven. Like the man who died next to Jesus.    Another man could do community service, even attend church, go through the motions, give money to charity...but at the end of his life, if he never accepted Christ, he will have to live eternity without Him.    It's like a big party, and people are trying to get in, and they say "Hey I was you best friend, look at all that great stuff I did", and He will say "I never knew you." And others are trying to break into His celebration, and mocking, and He will have to come get the bouncer to kick them out.    Another way of looking at it is the marriage feast.  A son decided to marry a peasant girl instead of a royal. The father overjoyed, had a feast for his son. He sent out invitations to the nobles by messengers, but the nobles tortured the messengers, saying they had better things to do. Time and time again, the messengers were tortured. Finally, the Father had to say "enough", and he had their lands taken away. So the father invited all the people of the kingdom, but they could only enter the feast if they wore the clean clothes He had provided for them. Some refused the free gift, and did not want it. Some did not even want to be in the feast. But some accepted, and even the dirtiest were accepted into the feast.    See how Christianity is so different from other "religions"?. A lot of times people do things in "Gods" name, but they never really knew Him.|`|a8kAassWaa	Please understand that God does not cause anybody to go to hell. Rather, man chooses to go there on his own. You can see the progression of those who reject Christ in the first 3 chapters of the book of Romans. The wrath of God is revealed against the unrighteous because man rejects the Creator and worships the creation (Romans 1:18-20). Men profess to be wise in their own eyes (v. 22) and exchange the glory of God for created things. These people then continue in a downward spiral of sin that is listed in verses 28-31, sins to which all of us can relate. Not only do they participate in these sins, but they also approve of those who do them (v. 32). Not only do men have the creation of the world to see Gods power, but they also have their consciences convicting them of their sin (2:14-15). In the end, man is left without excuse that we deserve to die, and we stand condemned in front of God.    Jesus Christ came in the flesh so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His name (John 20:30,31). This is another witness to Gods existence and also stands to condemn those men who choose to reject Christ as the Son of God. Because Christ came to pay the price of sin, and He came to explain the Father (John 1:18), man has no excuse for rejecting Him. Men choose to go to hell because they reject Christ, not because God causes them to go there. God has paid the price, revealed Himself to all, and now men are without excuse (Romans 1:20). God allows people to be born to give them the opportunity to believe, but it is mans responsibility to make that choice. What kind of God would He be if He did not give man the opportunity to place his faith in the Lord?    This is still a very difficult concept to grasp. We can only cling to what we know about Gods nature and character, trust that His sovereignty and mercy do not contradict one another, and believe that everything He does and/or allows will ultimately be for His glory. We submit ourselves to Him in worship and obedience and trust that He works all things according to the counsel of His will (Ephesians 1:11) and that His ways are perfect, even when we dont understand them. He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he (Deuteronomy 32:4).|`|bl0RZJrDaa	hell is not real    jesus is not real|`|93359f8cb488652b055bb246c8283544aa	He does not send non-believers to Hell. They choose that for themselves. We were given free will to make our own decisions. John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever BELIEVES in Him should not perish but have everlasting life."|`|dNSvlc6caa	Thus the folly of modern-day Christianity.  Look, I respect most Christian beliefs but this one is ridiculous.  An all-LOVING, all-KNOWING, all-GOOD God would NOT condemn anyone to an eternal punishment, least of all good people who simply don't believe that Jesus was God/Son of God (either because they never heard of Jesus or because they don't choose to follow Christianity).  And God/Jesus would absolutely not send someone to Hell who had never heard of Jesus - people above basically wrote that everyone has the chance to be Christian, in this specific instance, when they had never heard of Jesus, no they did not have a  chance to be Christian.  So there would be absolutely no reason for them to be sent to Hell.  This is the exact reason why I decided to not be Christian anymore.    I've written the following in other answers before, so disregard if you've read it already, if you haven't I think it's rather interesting:    1) I think if there is a God who will judge us after death, it should be according to our actions, not our personal beliefs. For example, pretend that youre God for a moment: look at two people who live the exact same lives as far as ethical conduct. They are both very good and ethical people. The first person believes in you- she believes that you are God and accepts you as her saviour. The second person does not believe that you are God and does not accept you as her saviour. Now as God, knowing that they both lived extraordinarily good, ethical lives, would you let the first person into heaven but send the second person to the eternal punishment of hell just for not believing in you? If you did let the first person into heaven but sent the second person to hell, would you be a just and good God? I dont think so. In fact, I think its ludicrous to say that a just and merciful God would do something like this. So what matters in life is that we live ethically, our conception of God doesnt matter. But even if God judged us for our actions, I don't think an omnibenevolent God could punish someone for eternity. Maybe for awhile yes, but eternity? I don't think so.    More on the eternity thing....     2) I could maybe see a finite amount of time to be punished or "cleansed", but infinite? Take the case of Hitler and pretend that Hell exists and that the time one were to spend there is a finite amount. So Hitler killed millions of people (indirectly I suppose but he's still responsible), let's say that for every person who died because of him he has to serve 5 billion years in hell. So he killed a couple million people, and at 5 billion years in hell per person, well, that's a lot of years. But it's still a finite amount of time. Now can anyone imagine an infinite time in Hell for someone who commits less heinous sins than Hitler?|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Heaven is for closers.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	You are confused because 'they' condemn themselves there!

Just stuff in my past that has made me not beileve in god or religion any longer.     I now think that all of this is a set up from churches so there can be hope in life instead of everyone freaking out on earth and totally chaos by not knowing whats going to happen when we die. And the churches consume people's money. Jackasses.     Also, religion was made so that people on earth would follow certain rules in life and would not cause destruction or chaos.    Notice all of those rules or whatever you people call it are about no violence, weed, sex or anything that is considered "bad".  When really, the church people smoke weed themselves.    Trust me, they do.    I wish, i really do sometimes, that i could live in a fantasy world like all you beilevers, and i mean that in the most humble, truthful way i possibly can. But i am unfortunate to experience pain about god that has lead me to not beileve in him at all.|`|olgdyKzEaa	The people who never have a chance to hear of God also never have the choice to turn away from God.

I heard from a missionary who reached people that were Muslims and they came forward and received Jesus and of a man that was blind and couldn't see who after hearing of these Muslims receiving decided to donate all his land to the church. God works in a mysterious way and gets to all who are open in their heart to hear and receive his word and grace and salvation. They get paid by the Church members a amount of money that any normal person would struggle to survive on , but with the grace of God they survive and reach those unreachable. They are brave and are normal people like you and me and they speak to people with simple words so they can understand. Thank God for this Missionary's they reach out where the members who go to church just sit comfortably in the pews and never dare to reach out beyond the church doors.|`|sARYW9hIaa	he did say to be kind to 1 another etc.     later years medieval europe(most) chose christiantiy    insted of living in peace with 1 another they fought against the muslims because they occupied the place where jesus lived - israel, egypt - calling them holy lands.     and the people would live in fear of god because if they commit a sin, they will go to hell.     nowadays ppl live in peace and forget about devil, satan hell stuf.|`|T8X7mrtHaa	According to the numerous times this question has been answered before, God gives free passes to heaven to people who - by no fault of their own - are born into circumstances where they cannot have the 'choice' to believe in Christ or not.

However, because of sin, and because God is holy, we are automatically divided from God.     2.This is why He made the hardest choice any parent could ever make and sent His only Son to save us from hell on earth and hell after death. He did this knowing that many of us would not even accept His son. But He did it anyway because He loves us beyond measure.    3. More than anything, God wants us to choose Him. *Deu 30:19-- I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, [that] I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live.* God doesn't want slaves. He gave us free will so that we could go to Him out of our own will. Just like we don't like people to be forced to love us, He wants us to embrace Him out of choice.    3. The bible says that everyone will have the oppurtunity to be save. Don't box God in. All those places where there's no TV, no bibles, etc--Trust me, God knows how to get to them. Nothing is impossible with Him.      4. The bible says God loves us so much, he keeps our tears in jars, and numbers the hairs on our head. I mean--He is really into us. Including you. He loves us dearly, so it pains Him that people are going to hell.      5. God is the perfect judge. Your (nor mine nor anyone) judgement does not exceeds God. He is perfect. So don't worry about people unfairely getting sent to hell. Not possible. If God sends them, they belong there. God knows our hearts in and out.     I hope this helps a little. Best of luck.|`|hOH33uBnaa	Interesting question. If people never had the exposure to religion I would think that God would forgive them just like he forgives children who can not understand the concept.

This is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel         after that time, declares the Lord.      I will put my laws in their minds         and write them on their hearts.      I will be their God,         and they will be my people.       No longer will a man teach his neighbor,         or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,'      because they will all know me,         from the least of them to the greatest.       For I will forgive their wickedness         and will remember their sins no more.               ~ Hebrews 8:10-12     and we all see the evidence of God by His creation all around us so we're without excuse.      The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualitieshis eternal power and divine naturehave been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.              ~ Romans 1:18-20     people choose to live in darkness and have so for a long time that it prevents them from being in the light. God also requires perfection and Jesus Christ is that perfection who can make us pure and blameless before God.    Jesus also said..     And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.                ~ Matthew 24:14     i believe from this that the gospel will be witnessed to ALL on earth, and the end will come. therefore, every1 will hear about Jesus Christ and they have to make a choice whether to accept Him or not.|`|RRpvR80Aaa	Jesus says in The Holy Bible that everyone SHALL hear/learn of Jesus.

What you are mistaken about is that Jesus wants,sends and/or sentences NO ONE but Satan and his demons to eternal damnation in The Lake Of Fire.    Jesus nor Almighty God WANTS any human being to spend eternity in The Lake of Fire.  Jesus nor Almighty God SENDS nor SENTENCES any human being into The Lake Of Fire.    Jesus and Almighty God gave/give mankind a CHOICE.    Jesus WANTS desperately for all mankind to CHOOSE Him and the sacrificial gift He WILLINGLY made of Himself for the complete atonement of mankind's sin.    Mankind are NOT robots.    Mankind has a heart, soul, and mind.    Therefore mankind MUST WILLINGLY choose to accept the gift and willingly love Jesus Christ for that gift He gave us on Calvary.

The Universe will end, Jesus will return and the Rapture will occur within at most a few thousand years and probably much sooner, far too short a timespan for things to occur on a galactic scale, in fact the entire age of the Universe when it ends will have been enough for gravity itself to make its way less than a tenth the distance across the disc of the Milky Way.  so it seems that with regards to creationism, this is rather a moot point.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	but....have we already collided ??|`|6lJuKKMHaa	OH!

It basically depends on the individuals on the body as well as whether the regional sales manager (a/k/a Circuit Overseer) has been pushing the elders to make this type of call.      If it was up to the elders, there would be very few of these calls made.  There are two primary reasons for this.  First and foremost, they don't get to count field service time for this type of call.  Second, this type of call is typically uncomfortable for all parties involved.    In my (not so) humble opinion, you should count yourself lucky to have been forgotten by these jokers.  Do you really want three window-washers in cheap suits sitting in your house telling you that you're unworthy?    ====================    As a side note, it's interesting that several other commenters on this question claim to be Jehovah's Witnesses.    Don't they know that they are forbidden from communicating with you ("not even say a greeting...")?  This is a serious sin in the JW religion...in fact, if someone is unrepentant about associating with DF'd persons, he can be DF'd himself!    So, are the JWs who communicated with you by answering this question going to confess to their elders?  I'm sure they will be forgiven if they show repentance.    Or do they think that they don't need to use "Jehovah's arrangement" in this respect?  Sounds like they are one step closer to "apostacy"...    Ahh...I just love the smell of hypocrisy in the morning!|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	As far as what we are all told, they are supposed to. However, it rarely, if ever, actually happens.     This leads me to believe that there might be a "top secret" directive from the higher- ups that elders should not even bother, because those people are considered "damaged goods" and would only taint the minds of "faithful" JWs, plus "the time is short" and the "ingathering" is coming to a close, so go on looking for the "lost sheep" and leave the disobedient ones to their ways...    This is speculation on my part, but I wouldn't be surprised at all to learn that it was true!|`|fOKssTulaa	the watch us here..but they wont reply. i have no idea why not.  i left too..many years ago..    they DO watch us..trust me on that..|`|90c183417812d5fa5a1e44250656cf01aa	There is a common perception, in my opinion, that for members who leave are perceived a having never really being "one of us"'. I happen to agree that they are probably correct in this thinking. In some cases anyway. Particularly those who were born into the religion and had no option but to imbibe the message at mother's knee. And then left when they got to an age of being free to choose.   To come back to your question, I think a lot of the elders actually believe that people in this category are a lost cause. Once the blinkers are off, it is tickets. Particularly as time passes. It is either a quick return or very very very long or it is never. There are some really good answers above me that I enjoyed. For instance the thought that it is an embarrassing call for them to make. I left 30 years ago and would not appreciate such a call. If for one moment I believed that they wanted to consider my enlightened views, it would be different. However, I know that their purpose would be to convert me back, and that aint going to happen. It would just waste their time. I am in a place where I consider I was never a member, as my heart was never in it. I can see some good in their beliefs and wish all of them well. One day we will meet on the other side of here, whatever and wherever that may be.|`|cR8UZdi1aa	I'm not sure why, but I do know its not because they think you're unworthy! If it really has been 27 years, so many things could have happened, records changes, residence changes, lost contact, so many things.  PLEASE take the first step & approach one of the elders at a meeting at the Kingdom Hall, explain to them your situation, I KNOW they will be more then happy to talk to you. If you are uncomfortable going, contact your local Kingdom Hall (in yellow pages) & ask for an elder to speak too or give them your name & address or phone   & have them contact you.   Please try! What do you have to loose?

No winter was but summer came behind,  Each hollow crests the wave,  They push each other in light and shade;     Be steady then and brave.     The duties of life are sore indeed,  And its pleasures fleeting, vain,  The goal so shadowy seems and dim,   Yet plod on through the dark, brave heart,      With all thy might and main.     Not a work will be lost, no struggle vain,   Though hopes be blighted, powers gone;   Of thy loins shall come the heirs to all,   Then hold on yet a while, brave soul,      No good is e'er undone.     Though the good and the wise in life are few,   Yet theirs are the reins to lead,   The masses know but late the worth;      Heed none and gently guide.     With thee are those who see afar,   With thee is the Lord of might,   All blessings pour on thee, great soul,      To thee may all come right!|`|R4KqEJekaa	i would like to meet the children of Gaza|`|khuhK4Gpaa	Prob.

Mystically, perhaps in another life you were selfish and now are the opposite and want to do good. Literally, you are just a good person with good intentions. I wouldn't call you crazy. It could be your life calling. If you were to be a firefigther, it would be a way your way of feeling useful. Of being of service to others, but mostly to yourself. Being your life's purpose. If you were to die, you would be seen as a hero, since you gratefully died, knowing that someone else lived. To others a hero, but to yourself, a purpose. Something you had to do. If you really feel this way, if could be the end of your life. Thank You for your good intentions.|`|m1493Va4aa	well i feel kinda like that. like i know if i have a kid and it's either me or the kid, i'm gunna give my life up.    but the way your doing it, being a firefighter, not so much.    but i'm very glade their are people out their like you because it makes me feel safe.     i'm very proud of you, and thank you :D    -Kandy

6SwaWSoyaa	Even though it may never be, it is nice to feel reassured that they know. Also you never know something may happen, it is better to go for it than to back out.

Our brain either thinks with logic or it thinks with our emotions. It's kinda like a 50/50 thing. So if logically confessing your love to someone will lead to ending a friendship or you getting turned down then the logical side of your brain is more than satisfied to not do it. It's the emotional side that believes that there might be some odd chance that it'll actually work so it's not satisfied. Then you start losing sleep over it and without sleep the logical side of your brain doesn't get rest and you have to completely depend on your emotional side for choices making you confused and easily irritated. That's when you come to Yahoo for answers.|`|TZgVwGzeaa	*raises hand*  I am guilty of this...lol.  In my situation, I was only friends with this woman for a few months when I fell for her.  We actually kissed.  I felt an amazing connection and it was just too difficult to hold those feelings inside.  So I told her....maybe the feelings would be reciprocated?  In order to get closure and be able to move on...I think it is important to let them know.  Each situation is different.  I am bi and my friend said she is straight. You have to understand that there are so many people that are in the closet, so it is almost like a guessing game.     At the end of the day...if they don't want to be your friend because of this...then maybe they weren't your true friend to begin with.  I have had many guy friends like me and I did not feel the same toward them.  Doesn't mean that I can't maintain a friendship with them.  Age, maturity and open mindedness of the people involved needs to be taken into account of course.  Again...each situation is very different.  Hope all of this made sense...lol|`|otiBw8WYaa	They probably don't want to spend the rest of their life regretting not expressing how they really felt.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	Well because there is a chance they like you back.

I was too afraid of rejection and now he haunts my dreams, and plays games with my heart many moons after I had the chance.|`|KBBonf97aa	Society has become very confessional over the past few decades and now people seem to think they should express every thought and feeling in the name of "being honest."  It's a little ridiculous, in my opinion.  Thoreau wrote, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."  Clearly, things have changed.  Oh, how I miss the quiet desperation.    When people profess their love with the knowledge that it cannot be reciprocated, they're simply passing that burden onto the objects of their love, rather than living with it, themselves.  It's a purely selfish act.  But they can justify it by declaring it honest, so they actually think they're doing something good.  While honesty is generally a good thing, it can also be self-serving.  I'm rather old school, in that I don't think honesty is always the best policy.  Sometimes evasion is the kinder policy, especially when telling an unnecessary truth only serves to manipulate someone else's emotions.
AM7CgQ4daa	I find it is always best to be blunt but truthful.  Just state that in your culture it is offensive to discuss and be disrespective about your partner, and you would prefer it if they would change the subject.    Hopefully this will stop the guys discussing it, and the girls should like you because you don't gossip about your girl friends.  If that does not work, just say excuse me and walk away.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	find new friends. it's not good to be around disrespecting people.   they should mind their own business. i may be white, but i deal with that stuff too. most americans are stupid. there are some though that are more respectful.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	I am a Chinese from S E Asia, I say stick to your asia values. It is precisely these western values they have that have deteriorated their culture. Just look at MTV, you must have tattoo or gold chain, dance with half naked girls and drink and smoke and 'make out' to be cool. Everyone is pressured to be high flying and 'cool' These rubbish values cause the westerners to have most  most unsuccessful family units.    There are many many asian values we can be proud off and don't be pressurized to follow these western values.      How you responds depends on how old you are.    If they can't have respect for you, you need to change your circle of friends.|`|N1UOHz58aa	Okay well yes in our American culture we do, do that so to be honest sorry if it defends you. It also bothers me a little bit i can agree with you on that one. I hate discussing who i like because it usually comes back and bits me in the but and i get sad and so on and so on. But anyways what you can do is tell them how you feel yes you will defend the girl but at least they will not ask you anymore. Just simply say you don't like talking about that kind of stuff if that's how you really feel.

The middle part of the stone shows a cursive type of hieroglyphics, which was readable, thats when the dialect of Greek popped up, so it was just 3 transelations|`|KT0fPjvPaa	I am in the process of using Rosetta Stone for Pashto.  It is a very good learning aid, but that's not to say that you won't need other resource materials as well.  It could be better, like providing a dictionary of said language with it, but that would in turn make it even more expensive.  It is a good investment overall.

Depending on how old he is will determine what you tell him. If he is a young man of about 3-9 years old. tell him where baby's come from. don't lie to him, but don't get in to detail. if he is 9-14 tell him the truth with a little more detail involved. he can find out from you or he can find out from his friends at school. its up to the two of you to be the parents and tell him the truth. Good luck to the three of you.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	If he is asking you, than he is comfortable about talking about sex with you.

Its odd!|`|jIk2ttH1aa	You should write to them or mention it to the manager.     You might find that LGBT people want books in proper sections.  For example a book on gay movement in history should be placed in history section with all the other books.  No need to seperate the 'gay' books from the rest.  I mean if you were studying the history of heterosexual movements you would find it in the history section.  So, why not?      I see it from both angles.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	That's weird because the ones around this area have all kind of books, not just erotica, but that would aggravate me.

In many bookstores you find erotica in the LGBT section and other LGBT-themed books spread throughout the store.  I think its a double-edged sword.  On the one hand it is nice that LGBT books are being included with other books, but it would be a lot easier to find them if they were put in the LGBT section.    If there is a Half Price Books in your area, they usually have a decent LGBT section, but most novels are still integrated into the store.  You could also try an online bookstore, but I kind of enjoy the brick and mortar stores.

dZMHd5PMaa	Because how do you believe in anything. Sometimes it is something that you have been raised to believe and it has stayed, sometimes you research it yourself and find what you believe, and sometimes you just know and from those points is where faith grows.  I mean we have faith that the sun is going to rise tomorrow b/c why? 1 of three things happened. Either we have been told everyday of our life that it will rise, We have looked on the internet at the weather station and saw that it was going to be a sunny day or have read a text book that tells us that the sun rises and set everynight, or we just know that the sun is going to rise and we don't have to question it. That is Faith|`|pbT0tJvqaa	You are right, I was taken to church as a child and I believed because I trusted my parents who took me. When I heard the preacher saying that Jesus could heal people I had child like faith, being a child, and asked to be prayed for so I could be healed. I was healed of a birth defect, when the doctors said I would never walk without braces on my legs and I would never have a normal life I listened to the preacher, got prayed for and God healed me. Went back to the doctors they told me that my feet were as normal as any body else's and I no longer needed to wear braces on my legs or corrective shoes again, I have never doubted there was a God since then. Childlike faith can move mountains.   When I got older I tried things my way, I would get drunk and sleep around and do drugs. That was fun for a season, left me miserable and empty inside, I have returned to my first love and my life could not be any better. I have peace, understanding, happiness that those who do not believe just can not understand. I wish they could, I have tried both ways and God's way is much better than ours.|`|QoenvlFuaa	I'm sorry that faith is such a hard concept for you. Maybe putting it this way will help.....    I was not raised to be Christian. My parents were drunks and fought a lot. There was no peace in my home. Yet I had peace within. I had been to church a time or two and had heard the Bible stories....and it just made sense to me. And I had peace with the concept of God and Jesus as His Son and all the rest. I didn't need proof; I just knew. That's faith.|`|kMLaynNWaa	BIBLE IS REAL THIER WAS A TIME I COULD NOT READ THE BILBE AT ALL WELL BUT I GOT HEALED AND THEY SAID YOU WILL READTHE BIBLE BETTER AND EVER SINCE IT HAS WORKED SEE IF YOU BELIEVE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND GOD WIL NEVER GIVE UP ON YOU IF YOU DONT GIVE UP ON HIM
AA11648578	No friend you are not understanding what faith is..faith is a gift from God and it is through faith we receive revelation from God.  It is not by your wisdom you are going to comprehend infinite God but through revelation form God and through this revealtion you will KNOW the truth.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Because Jesus changed my life almost 30 years ago.

Why can't they just have faith that having faith is good. Faith in faith. Of course, I guess they should probably have a good reason for having that underlying faith. Hmm.|`|zMcHYQeBaa	It's a sixth sense, basically    some have it, some don't    It feels nice.

In September I received my degree as a nuclear physicist, and in December, I was ordained as a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses.    When people learn that I am a scientist as well as a Witness, they often wonder how I reconcile my scientific knowledge with my belief in the Bible. Granted, for years I too wondered whether scientific knowledge and belief in the Bible could go together. Eventually, though, I became fully convinced that the Bible is in harmony with scientific fact. How did I reach that conclusion? Please allow me first to relate how I became a scientist.  A 19-Year Project    I was born in 1953 in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S.A., the third of 11 children. Our family was poor. We often had to move from one house to another because my parents could not pay the rent. We received most of what we ate through a government food-subsidy program, and the secondhand clothing we wore was given to us by people for whom my mother cleaned houses and offices.    My parents often reminded us children that the only way out of poverty was to get a good education. As a result, at a very early age, I set my mind on obtaining a college degree. I started school at the age of six, and I continued my schooling without interruption for the next 19 years. I enjoyed science and mathematics, so once I entered college, I began to pursue a career as a scientist.    While in college, I met a young woman named Del. A science professor had referred her to me so Del could get some help with a science course she was taking. Soon, though, our conversations went beyond science, and we fell in love. We were married on January 10, 1974during a two-hour interval between classes! Four years later, in 1978, I finally received my doctorate.    I had achieved what I thought was the key to success. I was a scientistand a nuclear physicist at that! With my newly attained degree in theoretical nuclear physics in hand, I could begin to reap the fruitage of my long studies. I was eager to make a name for myself in the scientific arena. In addition, I could now choose a job from among the many lucrative offers made by private companies and government institutions.|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	...Frank Morrison, a British lawyer of the 1930s, undertook an expedition to collect circumstantial evidence to disprove the resurrection. Such evidence, of course, is admissible in all courts of law in civilized countries to prove or disprove events of which there are no living eyewitnesses. When he analyzed the evidence, he reached a stunning conclusion: The resurrection had actually taken place! Morrison presented his case in his book, "Who Moved the Stone?"    Another factor worth considering is the character of the disciples. They were eleven cowardly men who shut themselves in a room after the crucifixion because they were afraid. Yet what galvanized them into action so that within their own lifetime, much of the then known world could hear the message of Christ? Some of them paid for this message with their lives. Would they have done so if the resurrection were a hoax?...|`|TMb076n6aa	I was almost killed by a assailant and miraculously delivered out of his hands without human intervention.     He did not harm me or take anything.    That is how I came to believe there was a God and heaven and hell where real.|`|QoenvlFuaa	Faith is not believing in something that is not there. It is believing in something you can't see. BIG difference.    For this, I'll overlook you calling us "stupid" and "dumb."|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\    Faith comes from the heart. You cannot try to us logic. It's not about logic.Its about trusting in God without having to see Him with your eyes, but you know He is there and He is real. After that, He reveals Himself to you in the most wonderful ways.|`|3ZzlrChgaa	Faith is not believing something that is not there, that we hope is there. That is faith in faith.    True Faith is believing and trusting in what God has said. He has already proved himself to us. Our faith is in his word. That he will save us from our sins.|`|5ee0364dd7d0159e953e987902e16956aa	There are usually REASONS behind someones faith : family, society, school, new friends, a book, simple-mindedness, no opportunity to see other points of view, hatred (YES! too !) love, admiration, a hallucination, drugs, a fortunate experience or coincidence, a war, examples, counter-examples... Once you have faith, this faith is self-maintaining (its very nature impeaches doubt ! ! !)  That's why it's usually uphill to become an atheist. Most atheists gained their choice by hard work, reading, discussing, observing, rationalising. It isn't a faith because it is open to enquiry. It doesn't refuse doubt ; by its very nature it lives on doubt.  And, another clich : atheists are not boring doubters and cynics; their lives can be beautiful, they can admire and love, have exciting spiritual experiences, see wonderful things in the world.|`|97b5127ddddc7a556167788c3c948831aa	alright, wheres my shoes?|`|f14e805e22b702d7c1124090d0de2220aa	Maybe you think this way because your definition of faith is false.  Faith is not believe in something that is not there it's believing in something you can't see.  Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there  i.e. wind.|`|DzXeJ66Daa	Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence 2 of things not seen.  2      Because of it the ancients were well attested.  3      By faith we understand that the universe was ordered by the word of God, 3 so that what is visible came into being through the invisible.  4      4 By faith Abel offered to God a sacrifice greater than Cain's. Through this he was attested to be righteous, God bearing witness to his gifts, and through this, though dead, he still speaks.  5      By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and "he was found no more because God had taken him." Before he was taken up, he was attested to have pleased God.  6      5 But without faith it is impossible to please him, for anyone who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.  7      By faith Noah, warned about what was not yet seen, with reverence built an ark for the salvation of his household. Through this he condemned the world and inherited the righteousness that comes through faith.  8      By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; he went out, not knowing where he was to go.  9      By faith he sojourned in the promised land as in a foreign country, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs of the same promise;  10      for he was looking forward to the city with foundations, whose architect and maker is God.  11      By faith he received power to generate, even though he was past the normal age--and Sarah herself was sterile--for he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.  12      So it was that there came forth from one man, himself as good as dead, descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sands on the seashore.  13      All these died in faith. They did not receive what had been promised but saw it and greeted it from afar and acknowledged themselves to be strangers and aliens on earth,  14      for those who speak thus show that they are seeking a homeland.|`|wFlObEjcaa	because their lives are so repetetive and un interesting that they hope there is something waiting for them after life|`|NaZGoUlwaa	All of my reasons for believing come from the Bible, which is the only truly reliable and infallible source there is.  I think the word faith is misunderstood, as it really means trust.  I believe because the Bible is intensely satisfying to my intellect, and I have faith (trust) that God will act on his promise.  That promise of course, is that we could have life through Christ.|`|JCnSm91uaa	The script that the Bible writers created to explain how we came about and the reason of our existence doesnt measure up to any decent level of human intelligence especially for a God.  One of God's primitive objectives after creating humankind was to set up a crude sting operation planting a forbidden fruit tree in the middle of the little Garden of Eden so Eve can eat of it at her earliest convenience. There was no guardian angel trying to talk Eve out of eating anything so after she ate the forbidden fruit God was fully justified to send the bulk of humanity to the Hell that he already created for Satan and his angels!  Now everybody will be tormented with fire and sulfur for ever and ever for Eves misbehavior, or for refusing to believe in Jesus.  Gods opportunistic pleasure includes the sending of his ONLY begotten Son Jesus Christ to Earth to be beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers spit to become the dignified spotless Lamb of God taking away the original sin? of the world by getting grotesquely nailed hanging to a Holy Cross. Jesus can save you from any sin except for the unforgivable sin of p*ssing off God the Holy Ghost by not paying any promised tithe and offering to the Church (Acts 5:1-11)! Now ALL believing Christians and Catholics must regularly snack this Jesus spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion so their sins can be forgiven and go to Heaven when they die (John 6:53)! Failure to believe Jesus and perform some selected rituals will send you to Hell to be tormented with fire and sulfur for ever and ever in full view and for the enjoyment of Jesus Christ alias The Lamb of God and all the true Christians of the right brand going to Heaven with him (Rev 14:10-11). Saint Peter says that all this story was not an accident but that God planned it in his infinite wisdom LONG BEFORE THE CREATION OF THE WORLD (1 Pet 1:20)!   Christians must lack any sense of morality and be extremely gullible to believe all this immoral crap in the Bible. They are also totally void of any decency to force their religious dogmas on the rest of our society! And the moron politicians in America fully support Christianity So help me God!|`|e6brEEbOaa	C.S. Lewis really explains this well in a book called "Mere Christianity", I will try to do it justice, please bear with me because I think it is a really good answer to your question.    Let me try to explain, all beliefs are based on reason and I used to think that if you have a good reason to believe something, then you will go on believing it forever, unless another good reason comes along to change your belief.    But that is not the way that we work at all.  Often people change their beliefs based up emotional responses or based on imagining a negative consequence to the belief that may or may not occur.    Let me give you an example of what I mean.  A person goes to a doctor and the doctor concludes that the patient has a tumor in his side that should be removed.     The patient thinks this over and concludes, that the doctor is competent and knowledgeable, and has plenty of experience, and comes highly recommended.  For these reasons, the patient comes to believe that having the surgery done, is the best thing.    Now the idea here is that if a person comes to believe something with good reason, they will not change their mind.  But when they are lying on the operating table and they are getting ready to put the patient under and they begin to imagine things like,    "what if they start cutting me open before I am asleep?"  "what if they cannot wake me up, afterward"  "what if they make a mistake"    And then as they slip on the gas mask a bit of a panic can overcome the patient.    Faith is what keeps that person on the operating table to go through with the operation in spite of the fear and the panic, he has faith because he has good reason, if the reason for the operation were poor, then the faith would not help.    You see our emotions and imagination can turn against our reasoning and cause us to act contrary to our reasoning if left unchecked, no matter how good the resoning may be.    But faith partners with reason so that we stick to what makes sense, rather than spinning off into a fit of panic.    Religious faith is no different, it is the partner of our good reasoning and the beliefs we derive from that good reasoning.    Sorry so long and I hope that clears things up.|`|xpvbDnthaa	Louis,   You live and move everyday using natural laws that you don't understand.  Electricity:  We don't even know what it is, but we all know how to use it, some of us in a little more detail than others. But all are ignorant at some level...yet we use it.  Faith is the principle behind action.  That is the reason we all "have it."      Perhaps you mean why do we have "Faith in Christ."  Well, only because it works.|`|Gf8GzwADaa	like one of your respondents said, there are so many reasons for faith. everyone who has faith does so for a different reason, everyone who trades faith for something else does so for a reason, individual to them. is one person's reason more valid than another's?

I know I would have turned several shades of red!    Send your friend an email.

Either that or they are just weird.|`|EfcS6HwJaa	if that is the norm to her....there was no reason for her to warn you...she probably did not even think about it.   this culture that we live in has such a stigma on nudity...we are the only nation that shuns nudity.

LOL|`|9JCmbQOhaa	its fine. Some people are very comfortable being naked around others. The only one who was embarrassed was you. Either accept it or ask next time before going over.|`|1ThWEediaa	You guys should made a THREESOME and get SEXY baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|PjDyeIeaaa	i am a guy and i like women so i am gonna give u an honest answer if this is true you should have told him"thats nasty in my country that is not normal nor is it in any country besides ures,i am leaving"    or just the first part    or if you were attracted to that as borat says you should have made the sexy time lololol|`|G2K8gsKLaa	damn thats some culture O.O    i dont think it was rude of her and her husband they would consider it normal but she should of picked up on your discomfort|`|2j84hXguaa	Got news for you... its not a culture thing.  Theyre trying to get you into a 3some and right now they are just judging your reaction to it.  If you dont stand up and say something up front and flatly turn them down next time your question will be... "My friend's husband was naked in the living room and then they were going PDA in front of me. Was this rude?"  Then the next question will be, "They were both naked and sucking on me is this rude?"  Geez its easy to see where this is going.|`|biiAAZqtaa	That's tricky. She should have told you before hand about that, or at least moved to a different room since it made you uncomfortable. You can't really tell them how to behave in their own home but they definitely should have warned you. Just don't go over there anymore and have visits at your house, but also let her know how you felt so it doesn't seem like you're not open to her culture.|`|55x3A8OHaa	lol I love your question is so funny, I cant stop cracking up , oh my this just made my day. yes it is rude but funny to tell others . tears are coming out of my eyes its hilarious. sorry about your discomfort.oh it is rude because even if in their culture its ok here is not so thats why I think its rude LOL|`|iNCzewKRaa	Why are you asking us ?   If YOU think its rude then why did you not get up and leave right away ?  The fact you did not leave must mean something, did you like what you seen ?  Did they offer anything else that you might have enjoyed ?  I think that asking us is just your way to justify why you did not leave !|`|bjqjhnyLaa	why|`|EPVWrEOxaa	i guess for you it would be rude but you should ask her to tell you in advance so you can tell her to tell him to cover it up!|`|4GIJ4mfwaa	Really weird!!!  Just ask him to put clothes on.  What is their culture?|`|3tu88JTgaa	u should of say what's on your mind and ask him to put clothes on. if not, just get up and leave.|`|edcTNpg8aa	You should've had a threesome!! daing you missed you opportunity|`|PVlKAfTHaa	She may not have known it was weird... even thought it was, if she was from another culture. Just let her know, next time you come over, that you would prefer a clothed husband walking around, and that it made you a little uncomfortable. Be upbeat about it, but don't subject yourself to situations you aren't comfy in.|`|ff4fdc55e4134a54a6545ed164302405aa	Yes sweetie, you should have left. At the least you should have  said something. This is the USA, not a third world island.|`|YQDItpnVaa	I can't imagine this being a culturally normal thing to do, regardless of the climate. The only reasonable explanation is they were trying to find out if you were interested in a threesome.|`|Uo16H34Aaa	I would have ran away and never talked to her again   lol|`|5vprfgCbaa	Dead sexy|`|ZNC0d9jPaa	In your home, yes, this would have been very rude.  In their home, no.    If it's their culture, so be it.  It's not as if he made sexual advances towards you, he was just being himself in his house.|`|aatk3g4iaa	well yea if you were putting out a vibe of discomfort towards his being naked then he should have left or put some clothes on but if he just didn't get it then you should have somehow said that you felt weird to kind of hint him to put on some clothes|`|OSxReGI6aa	haha silly culture,|`|HWRRFA0qaa	YEP & WEIRD|`|nqOqaNIEaa	be like "put ur clothes on or im thinkin threesome"|`|8j7FCEOraa	Hey, I would of left.  I dont want to see some guy's junk.|`|LKx4TejLaa	woah that is crazy!! i think in company he should have put some pants on!!|`|wdz5RMaeaa	They are in America now .... but most do not care ... sounds sexual to me.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	Rude is relative,,, she is just plain poor in etiquette|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	As long as he has something to exhibit as good to see, we call it exhibitionism. Don't leave, enjoy the view and if you feel embarrassed by it. just do not come back next time. If you do come back next time, then it is another story.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Give him a tube sock to wear|`|T6nmD3X9aa	LMAO  so uncomfortable!!!    There are many people from other cultures that feel this way, sometimes they are just nudists and it has nothing to do with culture. I would tell your friend it made you a little uncomfortable and please warn you if this is going to 'suprise' you at times when you go there. She will probably not take it offensively, she will probably have a good laugh with you about it!    lmao    good luck!|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	That is very awkward! I think its rude to put you into that kind of situation, when you are not used to it and it's not part of your culture. And if you should have left or not, it depends on how you felt. If you thought it was bad enough to leave, then you should have. You shouln't stay in a situation where you feel totally uncomfortable and are just staying to please others. But, if you could deal with it, then I don't see why you shouldn't stay. Obviously they don't care, so it's not inappropriate.|`|N1UOHz58aa	Its rude but not as much as it is just plain gross and creepy. Jeeze that must of been very uncomfotable if it was me i would of been out of there in a heat beat so my ? for you is y ddint you leave?|`|jgedIY8taa	Americans are often criticized when we're abroad because we're not sensitive to the "native culture."  This is the so-called "Ugly American" syndrome.    Well, I agree...we should be more sensitive to native culture when living or traveling abroad.  But the reverse should also hold true...when in the United States, people should adapt to and respect certain customs.  It's not like we've got a lot of them, but men unexpectedly parading around nude to the discomfiture of female guests certainly counts as one of them.  Yes, I agree it was rude; yes you should have left.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Sounds as if it really upset you and YES you should have left.    Sounds like they thought they could do a three some.   Some Friend.   You don't need Friends like her.
3OZgcntfaa	A person of any age should only look at pornographic material if they have the level of comprehension to separate what is fake entertainment and what real sex is like.    I know plenty of adults who think the way to turn their girlfriend on is to slap at her womanly parts like she is a drum... so not even intelligent...    Porn should not be a substitute for sexual education and learning about the human body.|`|bDmQNaQKaa	Of course its completely natural|`|AA11791312	Define "porn." I'm not saying that bare breasts and hard penises should be shown between episodes of TWO AND A HALF MEN and CSI, but c'mon! Janet Jackson had an accident and people behaved as if Armageddon had happened.  But I want to know how those same people explain when little five-year-old Johnny asks, "Daddy, what's 'erectile dysfunction' mean?"    Commercials for Viagra, Levitra and Cialis get shown every two minutes. That Arby's commercial about the guy getting a "special gift" from his wife for his birthday. And we all know what THAT means.    If commercials, rap videos, etc. aren't a form of soft-core porn, then I don't know what porn is.|`|yzgS5KiQaa	As long as they are mature enough to not think that the situations portrayed make broader statements about how we should treat women, what woman want in bed, how often and soon a woman should "put out" and what situations are okay. An immature mind may become normalized to rape, incest, a male oriented sex life or other wrong behaviors by watching porn. Also, if porn becomes an addiction (anything that causes pleasure can become an addiction) and that means disrupted your life (missing work, school, feeling like you can't stop etc.) then it would probably be best to stop. Otherwise, it's fine. Human beings are sexual beings.|`|uZQIUeyvaa	I don't know, but it is natural.|`|P544Sbmqaa	All teens are curious, and I think that it is ok.  However, I dont think it is healthy for teens to be watching porn 24/7.  Porn does give an unrealistic view of sex, and at that age it can be easy for them to think that is how sex really is.|`|376ce902307f5e574ed98c7f99ccba8daa	I think teenagers should wait until they're adults. Take some time to come up with your own fantasies before you delve into the world of porn!|`|Vo6YukG2aa	Yeah,  why does age matter? As long as you're mature enough...|`|UaI7cbVcaa	of course. its completely natural|`|Y9qTbFFraa	Idk, never really thought wether it's all right or not lol|`|61315c556c8efa34d1991d342fa8b948aa	I suppose that since many teens are already sexually active that looking at porno doesn't really matter much.|`|HYFuy0Lyaa	Ooh excellent question!  looking at porn is ok but you must remember to watch it in moderation  but if you are in between the ages of 10 and 30 and you are "pleasuring yourself" then it will increase your chances of prostate cancer by up 40%. and porn and masturbation usually go hand in hand. i hope that answers your question :D|`|5RH9Osdsaa	I think pornography objectifies people and distorts views on sex and sexuality, however, I also realize that it is natural to be curious.|`|EagkCeNHaa	Sure.|`|05287f66d8c459131879b557683d1b73aa	They are curious and often comparing their own development to others. Oftentimes they are curious about the opposite sex as well.    It becomes dangerous when they start thinking of themselves as not up  to par with the idealized version of porn models and actors.
IdV7TOcOaa	im a very active person, usually im lookin all over the place, noticing my surroundings often so if my eyes happen to come across a beautiful woman, my eyes will stop for bout  a second...or two...than ill be like "oh crap, and just look away"    plus its hella messed up, cuz all the pretty girls KNOW that they are looking very attractive so they like the attention and im like what the hell, everyone gets baited..    like specially in highscool me and my boyz at lunch sittin and eating and if there is an attractive girl that walks past that all of their heads turn than im like, i shouldnt turn, so i dont.    so most of the time its a passive thing, its like whatever, yea she might be pretty, but girls come and go, and i just hope i get a pretty wife so wuteva|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Well, I guess we have a lot more to look out for than the guys do. So, yeah, I think we do have to be more careful when it comes to modesty, and revealing ourselves too much.    I try my best to just dress without attracting any attention to myself. I don't like it when people stare. O_o|`|CQz8dMzFaa	Girls only have to be more careful than guys when it comes to clothing, to ward off the sickos. Most girls(if not all) are very capable of controlling their gazes. However, I think a guy would be lying if he says he never looks at girls, not that I mean they're pervs, but they do look at pretty girls, its biological wiring!  I personally dress and act modestly (unless it involves Richard Gere,that's when the drooling starts, so help me God!).|`|CU2eG18kaa	I can actually honestly say I do, or try my hardest to do. I only started really trying to act that way very recently though. Like before, I used to walk around school thinking the dumbest stuff like, "who cares if he gets better grades than me, I'm still smarter. Who cares he's a top athlete, he's probably real dumb though. Even though I'm not on the basketball team, I bet I can beat anyone at school. If I wanted I can get good graded too." and so on...as u can see, I kinda had a huge ego, but now, recently, its weird, like only last week I was the class clown cracking jokes at eveyone, wanting to be the popular kid, wanting to be the one everyone admires and making a lot of money, but now, I've changed my life completly for the better. My friends say I'm quieter, I backbite less(bc I know its a major sin in islam), I try hard not to just say any stupid things for attention, and have almost no ego, meaning I don't feel entitled to stuff, like I don't care if I'm an all A student, I deserve the grade I WORKED for, not just an easy A. Its strange I know, but now even at school all I think about is Islam and how not to be hypocritical towards my religion just bc I'm in the company of my friends. Like everyday, I think before I speak, not wanting to insult others. I even told my friends today, I can't sit with yall if ur gunna make fun of other ppl while we eat lunch. So ya, I try really hard to be modest and have no ego, bc I know what ppl think of me doesnt matter when we all die.|`|1rX7HB8Qaa	I always dress up modestly......I dont wear hijab....but I make sure that my breasts are totally hidden and my butt is not doing a display. i hate when someone looks down there. and i hate to see guys in shorts.also i dont like when guys do a show of their muscle by wearing tight t-shirts. i swear it makes them look horrible and disgusting.|`|3E2EQH12aa	youll see the modest ones at the masjid.. not so much out and about      not all modestly dressed girls act modestly, no.. but they definately have to be more careful than the guys do.. no ones going to accept a loudmouth hijabi making rude remarks or laughing like a hyena in public or running around stomping her feet (seen all of these, unfortunately) modesty is supposed to be a reflection of iman that comes to the outside, both with hijab and the girl's attitude. if she cant act  decent she shouldnt be portraying herself as otherwise|`|Eos7bQKRaa	I don't think guys need to worry about such issues much in islam, most men's wear isn't as revealing as women's. also women don't tend to oggle like guys do, and even if they did guys usually like it....

Lolz|`|ZOFM0g9haa	Nah...I no have kitty nor do I wear ish glasses.|`|LmKVepcXaa	We used to have a cat named Muffins. Actually I would call him Muffins, my baby sis would call him butterscotch, my brother would call her "it", my husband would call it besa (cat in arabic). We all called it different names. The poor thing was probably having an identity crisis. We had to give it away because my mom vowed to never step foot in my house if I kept it.     No, I don't wear glasses Alhamdullah. But I did go to the Eye Doc. so he could give me a pair of reading glasses (you know so I could look smart) but he looked at me all weird and was like "I guess there is a first for everything". He said he wouldn't give me a script cause it was just a waste of time and money but if I wanted a nice looking set of frames they would put glass in them for free.|`|ubzpvAwIaa	i have two cats..  one is a boy hes name is micky  and the other is a girl and her name is roxy (rockc)  and i do not wear glasses  xx|`|AA10248239	We have a cat named Asad.

P0fcmrkSaa	It depends on the mean of the preposition and of the noun.    IN can be used with Accusative ans Dative.  If the question is "Where?" (wo?) its used with Dative  "Where to?" (wohin?) - with Acc.    Ich gehe in dieses Caf (wohin?) - I go to this cafe (Acc)  Du sitzt in diesem Caf (wo?) - You seat in this cafe (Dat)    If the noun has an article or some word like "this" (diese), or some adj. its also are conjugated.     Ich gehe in ein kleines Haus. (wohin?) - I go to a little house  Ich bin in einem kleinen Haus. (wo?) - Im in a little house    Ich gehe ins (in das) Haus. (wohin?) - I go to the house  Ich bin im (in dem) Haus. (wo?) - Im in the house
6a44deb0b64aa4a94dcb485934e01693aa	Heheh, that's when you really get under their skin and say something very adult, like, "Please don't take out your frustration at the fact that you're just not a very good teacher on us innocent students.  We're just here trying to learn, so why are you making it so difficult?  Maybe this isn't the right career for you."
mwdwDOaWaa	As far as i know, the Khans live in Europe, parties hard with the royals and the elites and enjoy horse racing. Yup, they can be considered a foremost authority, on horse racing and breeding  but of Islam i don't know! However they are the heads of the Ismaeli sect of shiasm.    PS: thats how a descendent of the Prophet and an imam should live. I urge the mullahs of taliban and al-qaeda to follow their examples, so that Islam can truely become the religion of peace as it was meant to be!|`|AA10248239	Not at all!

ASSbLOk6aa	As the other answers have said it, people just gets jumpy over everything.    What is offensive? When people start thinking it is.    I once asked a Jew politely, "What is your race?" I got a mouthful from him "People don't use the word race anymore these days@!!"    Well not from where I come from , we use it all the time, I am from Singapore, and there are many many RACES here, so we always ask " What race are you ?" And people happily say "Chinese or Malay or Indian or Caucasian etc."    Maybe that jew is linking the question to 1942 when the Germans segregated the races. ( I am not against any JEWS By the way)    It is just how people perceived it, So that woman who got jumpy over the word Black is probably because her environment she live in has declared that word to be offensive.|`|iNtPA7X9aa	wow.  no, i wouldn't think the term black is offensive.|`|b2d574b8a654cff08132b97a7ed59201aa	I think it's a little uncouth to refer to a person as "the black guy" or "the white guy". Even when you're just referring to someone's appearance, it can sound like you're deliberately separating them from everyone else in the room, especially if they happen to be the only person there of that color.    I've heard people use the phrase "the black gentleman" or "the African-American lady" as a way of signaling that you're trying to be respectful.|`|N1UOHz58aa	Usually it not a thing taken as offended. The person you must of said that to must be a very sensitive person like all the other people said. But no its not taken offendly to most people but the person in line was obviously offended so you cant say no body gets deafened because that's a person and they did so usually the odds are they aren't but in some cases I guess they are.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	No it shouldn't be offensive in the least.  Political correctness has gone WAY too far.|`|wtrjg5l4aa	You have a good question, and I don't really have an answer...|`|DUkXr1OCaa	welcome to the world of political correctness.|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Anything can be offense if you find the right person.    Normally though, no, calling someone black is not offensive.|`|CwqW45Rmaa	People are too sensitive these days. Everything seems to be offensive.|`|TyxkJzxzaa	I think it's the particular situation in this case. One could have said, "This gentlemen is ahead of me," or something similar. However, using the term black is not offensive. I'm a black person and know a lot of people that use this term. I think her response was unprofessional.|`|s67BloUxaa	not offensive as long as they are black|`|lwG6tvOqaa	sounds like the person who reacted to this is just overly sensitive.     Maybe she would've prefered you call that guy a brown person.|`|4m3z1ztEaa	nope  my friend, who has a grandmother who was segregated in deep South, and a great grandmother who was a slave herself, told me that it is OK to say it
EBGdlo35aa	Well, IF you believe the bible - which says that humankind was created without sin - then the answer is "no".  The bible actually attempts to make us *more* human, *more* like we were before sin plagued our species.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|PmG0Isnnaa	When a person has faith in Christ, they resist their SINFUL nature, but not their human nature.  Jesus himself was fully human, but never sinned.|`|93359f8cb488652b055bb246c8283544aa	No, it says to repent and turn away from sin. And yes sin is in human nature but we are still supposed to turn away from sin.|`|Z7RiriL6aa	Reading the Bible doesn't change your humanity, it only gives you directions on how to live your life morally and according to its standards. it is your choice if you want to follow it or not.|`|hQDapmICaa	human nature is evil    so it is good to turn and repent from it and put on God's nature/image      Gen 6:5  And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.      Jer 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?

You can be human and not sin. We did before the fall of man in The Garden of Eden|`|JGQsowK9aa	it doesn't make us less human or more than humans. It helps us to follow in Jesus/God's foot steppes more. Sin is what cause us to go against our basic nature which is to follow God, so the bible putsus back on the path.|`|oTwymgpIaa	No, it helps one maintain a sense of purity and consciousness of the effects our actions have on the human race as a whole. It does not say repent from being human, it says don't be a glutton, use logic in your decision making, and take others into consideration before making choices, that last one is what the majority of people have a problem with. ;-)|`|VERrlErvaa	Man was doing pretty well until they ate from the Tree of Knowledge.  God created man in His image - and by repenting and putting your faith in Christ, you are allowing Him to redeem you and make you whole again through Christ's crucifixion on the cross.    Might I suggest a fantastic website that may be able to answer all your questions...    www.worldslastchance.com    There is a section there that has answers to many questions and it's free to become a member.  The forum and chatroom have many individuals who would be happy to assist you in your inquiries.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	No it makes you more human, because you understand why we are here and what purpose we are to try and strive to achieve. However we are not suppose to give in to the desires of the flesh which may lead to a sinful life which to some people may be their idea of being human. That is not to say we can't enjoy sex or food or the other comforts in life, we just do  them in the proper context like marriage and with the proper amount of self discipline.|`|FOZGMadaaa	The word of God prompts man to return to his original purpose.    The love of God causes men to repent.    The worldly uses the word human. Humanity is only a candidate for sin.    The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.    The knowledge of Christ is the beginning of understanding.    It means we are the chosen by God if we obey his word.|`|PZp8wmRZaa	I think that the bible along with other sacred religious texts detach man from his natural state of being.  So, yes, it does make people turn away from being human.|`|oVail6aAaa	yes, it does. but our basic human nature is evil, and we need to turn away from it and strive for better things.|`|eTm9uLqyaa	It doesn't make you less human,  I think it makes you more human,  I mean you are becoming more opinionated..

That is our DNA our degenerate nature.    Gal 5:16  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.   Gal 5:17  For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.   Gal 5:18  But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.   Gal 5:19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,   Gal 5:20  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,   Gal 5:21  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.   Gal 5:22  But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,   5:23  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.   5:24  And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.   5:25  If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.     Our degenrate nature is not God's fault. It came by disobediance. God told Adam not to eat of the tree of knowledge. God warned them if the did they would surely die.     They disobeyed the only thing God told them not to do. Untill then they lived in paradise where there was no sin or death. They walked and talked with God. After sin and death entered into the world it separated man from God.    Jesus died for our sins that we might have LIFE and life more abundant.    Today we have two choices. We can either sin by giving in to the dictates and lusts of our flesh or we can walk in the Spirit so that we do not fullfill the lust of the flesh.    Jesus said, John 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.   3:4  Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and be born?   Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.   That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.   3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.   3:8  The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.     1Jn 2:17  And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever.     The will of God is not the dictates of our degenerate human nature.     To live for God you must be born again of the water and spirit by repenting and obeying...Acts 2:38-39|`|BYTrrqN6aa	In my opinion the Bible, as well as the teachings in many religions and organized beliefs, condemn aspects of human nature.

I never have a date. I've been single for 5-7 yrs now, haven't had sex in two years, am pretty much normal, not socially odd, nor anti-social, attractive, i've seen a therapist. I'm not needy or desperate, am healthy, fit, active, have a positive outlook on life, can't do one night stands, tried dating, attracted strange controlling men. I spend a lot of time alone, to myself. I am not close with family.     So yeah. I can't wait till that day is over just like any other holiday that's family related.     So don't feel so bad.

All of those who have not heard about Jesus Christ will go to heaven. Adults as well as children. In todays society there are those that have never been introduced to the Word of God. Babies are born pure. They have no sin, they cannot willfully commit a sinful act. I had a miscarriage when I was five months pregnant. My little angle is in heaven. At conception this is a life, not at birth. So, now we have three different sets of souls in heaven automatically.......The rest of us have to make a choice as we know that Christ is coming again, and the decision on if we are going to Heaven is solely up to us.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	according to christians gays children of Sodom are in heaven...but gay adults are been torture in hell by Jesus Christ|`|6lJuKKMHaa	"Suffer the little children to come unto Me for 'such' IS the kingdom of God."

Certainly not.  Furthermore, I believe you'd need proof to back up the unfounded assertion that the baby does not believe in God, and I believe you might find that difficult without being able to perceive it's mind    Just because one is born as "blank slate" does not logically make them an atheist    EDIT: A baby has "unconsciously rejected theism"    ????????????????    Proof?  Source?  And not true.  Many Indians indeed thought of the great spirit as divine.

Evolution is very much a branching path and I really don't understand why you think floresiensis disproves evolution.    (I suggest reading the wikipedia article (better than nothing) which links to the four modes of speciation: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric.)    I agree that if there was a god, he may have made many different species and then settled on one. Although that is not the act of a perfect, allmighty, all-knowing god; such a god should know in advance EXACTLY what species he wants to create because after all he already knows EVERYTHING.     So if you believe god "played dice", testing out various species like a scientist conducting an experiment...you have created a critical contradiction to the "all-knowing god" that many religions believe in. The way you phrase "settled on one" implies a decision. This implies god needed to create them before he knew which species would be best, but an all-knowing god would know which species would be best for his purposes. So your belief is completely impossible within the abrahamic religions, which all teach of a god who knows EVERYTHING.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	Neanderthals had bigger brains than humans, but they were solitary creatures.

Only true way to find out is let your relationship take its course and not pressure it as its your last chance at happiness. Be happy with what you have in life.    Good Luck!

We still have laws we abide by even in telling the dreadful events that has happened that is now History. The same with the Bible. The story's of all of the dreadful events is leading to where we are today. There were laws in the Bible, laws that were not followed. Their was famine, wars, just like today, but it was imperative that the good and bad History be recorded. That is what has helped our Nation become what it is today.

D4LnRg2Daa	Life is a religious experience Auntie so it's been a while now.  When we continually evolve as Christians like we are supposed to we don't have a first religious experience.  I have been considering the concept of God since I can first remember,  Isn't it natural to do that?  When you search back as far as you can wasn't there a question always there?  We don't find God, He was never lost we were.  We aren't born again, we are in the process of being born into an understanding of love all our lives.  That is what the Spirit does.  Those who can point to an exact minute when they were born again have perhaps never progressed past this minute because that sudden rush of emotion when God enters our lives is not being born again it is only the beginning of everything wonderful that follows.  I admit I lost my way a few times and had doubts but I think as I look back that this was as much a part of my religious journey as any other part.  If we don't ask the hard questions we don't get the good answers.

I was raised by a Methodist father and a mother who had been raised Church of Christ but described herself a heathen.     Dad was on the road a lot, and he and Mom never had me baptized, because they wanted me to choose my own path.    I started going to a local Baptist church when I was in first grade. I started asking questions, like "what's baptism?" etc. I got told not to worry, that if I was there I was obviously already baptized. Other questions I asked met with similar responses or complete avoidance.    By the time I hit middle school, I was agnostic.     A few years after high school, I started going to the local Unitarian Universalist church, which I felt kind of at home at because of the intellectual discussions on humanism, which I later decided went against what I truly believed.    I met the man I now call my husband at about this time, and he was a Pagan, a priest of Anubis. shortly after he and I became engaged, he helped me become a follower of Athena, for I thought perhaps that was my right path.    Well, he ended up in the hospital after a nasty reaction from some meds and met up with a Catholic priest who helped my husband back to the Catholicism of his youth.    I went to my first Mass out of curiosity, and that September, shortly before we were married, I started RCIA.

It is not known whether this occurred before she died or immediately after her natural death.

The notion that she was without sin is blasphemous.  If she had been born spotless, then SHE would have been the messiah.

NEXT QUESTION PLEASE.|`|I0aosHnuaa	mary was an assumption .. she is an imaginary character in the bible fairy tales.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	While it is true that Mary is a virgin, her assumption in to heaven has to do with how she lived her life and the manner in which she got to heaven, not specifically her virginity.  Mary lived a very holy life so she was given the honor of the assumption.  She did not ascend to heaven like her son, she was assumed.    Mary was assumed into heaven body and soul.  This did not happen to Mary of her own will, it was God who did this.  She died, her soul went to heaven and then God decided to reunite the body with the soul and she was lifted to heaven by the power of God.      Now contrast this with how Jesus went to heaven after his death.  Jesus ascended to heaven.  This means he went of his own will.  Since Jesus is God, he was able to will him self to heaven with his own power.      Interesting note on this:  Mary is always shown as a young woman.  At the age of 33 she stopped aging on the outside.  Her body aged inside and that is why she died, but the exterior remained that of a 33 year old.  This is because Jesus was to die at the age of 33.  So that is why Jesus and Mary always look the same age as adults when you see them in pictures.  When you hear about apparitions of Mary, she is always shown as a young woman.  Go a head and do a google search for apparitions of Mary in Fatima and Lourdes and see for your self.|`|34a48b994ef5303d32941f80755dfd6baa	Yes she was a virgin.|`|8IHfytEvaa	Mary died, just like everyone else.    She was not "assumed".  This is a new doctrine or dogma that came out in 1950 by Pope Pius XII.    He created this new teaching without a shred of Biblical evidence.  This is one of many reasons to avoid the Roman Catholic Church.    Mary was a virgin until Jesus was born and then Mary and Jospeh had at least six more children the old fashioned way.    Those children are named in the Bible, Matt 13:55-56.    Any one who claims these are Jesus' cousins can't read Greek.  Any one who claims these were Joseph's children and that he was an elderly widow, is brainwashed or lying.    It is clear from the Greek New Testament that these are Mary's children, its just that simple.    There is nothing sinful about having sex with your husband.  In fact, its a sin for a married woman to not have sex regularly with her husband.    Read the Bible and compare what you read with what your church teaches and does.  If it does not agree, find another church.|`|gwqS6xHpaa	Assumption is when God raised Mary to Heaven.|`|PZp8wmRZaa	I always assume that's she's a fig newton of man's imagination....born out of the zodiac constellation Virgo.|`|G7SiH0ohaa	Its hard to believe that a woman pushed a baby out her uterus without a fertilizing sperm...Did God just zap a little embryo into Mary's vagina?

She was ever virgin.    Yes, she was sinless throughout her whole life. She is greeted by the angel "Hail, full of grace."     However, the Dogma of the Assumption is that Our Lady was assumed body and soul into Heaven and that the rot of death was not allowed to touch her pure body, as per the desire and merit of her divine Son, our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.     The Catholic outlook on this, which is in keeping with the Bible, is fairly simple: Adam and Eve were created without sin. They never had to sin, but they chose to rebel against God's commands and authority, so consequently the human race fell and all human beings are ordinarily subject to death and decay as a result. Mary, on the other hand, was given the great gift of being conceived without the taint of Adam and Eve's sin, so that she never committed actual sin. She received this gift because she was to be the mother of God's son, the Second Person of the Trinity, and God thought it fitting to prepare a pure and unspoiled vessal for Him.     Her condition represented what all human beings could and would have been, and what saved persons one day will be: without sin.    Since she was without sin, and thus didn't have to die or undergo the decay of death, at the time of God's choosing she was assumed bodily into heaven, which is different fro ascending to heaven under one's own power, as Jesus did.     Jesus' resurection made possible the eventual bodily resurrection of all of his followers, and Mary was the first to enjoy the reward made available to all who would believe in Him. After all, what is more appropriate than that Jesus' own mother should be blessed in such a way?     We readily admit, of course, that no explicit biblica support for the Assumption exists; yet there are indeed biblical indications of a special or extraordinary death, or "visit to heaven" in a way out of the ordinary.    For example, Enoch was a particularly righteous man. It is written that he "walked with god" and that "he was not, for God took him." This description is somewhat mysterious, but New Testament revelationfurther explains it.    Hebrews 11:5- By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God.    Elijah, also, is caught up directly into heaven.    If these two men who were still subject at least to original sin and probably did commit sin in their own lives were considered great enough by God to bring  directly into Heaven, then why not Mary, the mother of Christ, God's Son? Indeed, it is only right that this is so.|`|RRpvR80Aaa	I do not understand nor pretend to understand the intricacies of Catholicism.    I do know and understand most of the KJV Holy Bible.  Mary was a young teenage virgin girl betrothed through her parents to Joseph. Almighty God CHOSE her to be the mother of Jesus and the glory of Almighty God fell upon her and she became pregnant.    Joseph did not put Mary aside when she told him what The Angel of The Lord told her and what had happened. It was Joseph's right to do so, but he did not. The angel of The Lord visited him as well and told him what Almighty God had planned for them (confirming Mary's confession). He promised to marry Mary and he also promised not to consummate their marriage vows until after such time that Jesus had been safely delivered of Mary and she was physically restored.    I believe Catholicism believes that Mary remained a virgin her entire life.    The truth is Joseph and Mary had eight children together after the birth of Jesus.  So obviously Mary did not remain a virgin her entire life.  Nor was Mary immortal. She was human. She lived and she died as all humans will.    I do not know why Mary is so elevated and prayed to and worshiped by Catholics. She had nor did she exhibit any supernatural abilities or foreknowledge abilities during her life.    What she did do was NOT abandon Jesus during His persecution, torture, mock trial, and unspeakable murder.

Pastor Art,   These were the children of Mary the wife of Cleophas, , (St. Matt. 27. 56; St. John 19. 25,) and therefore, according to the usual style of the Scripture, they were called brethren, that is, near relations to our Saviour.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Because she was the Mother Of Jesus Christ. She was made Queen of heaven and earth. it is in the book of revelations|`|AA12343309	The Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption are not due to Mary being a virgin but sinless.  The Church teaches she was a virgin but it has nothing to do with the Doctrine of the Immaculate Conception and the Assumption.    The Immaculate Conception is a doctrine that Mary was conceived without the stain of original sin in her own mother's womb as she was chosen from all eternity to be the mother of the second person of the Blessed Trinity.  She was not conceived virginally.    Since corruption of the body comes from sin, the Church teaches that she was assumed into Heaven.    I might add that Eastern Orthodox does not have either as a doctrine but they celebrate the Assumption on August 15 like the Catholic Church does.

Such evidence, of course, is admissible in all courts of law in civilized countries to prove or disprove events of which there are no living eyewitnesses. When he analyzed the evidence, he reached a stunning conclusion: The resurrection had actually taken place! Morrison presented his case in his book, "Who Moved the Stone?"    Another factor worth considering is the character of the disciples. They were eleven cowardly men who shut themselves in a room after the crucifixion because they were afraid. Yet what galvanized them into action so that within their own lifetime, much of the then known world could hear the message of Christ? Some of them paid for this message with their lives.

YOU must not look for omens, and YOU must not practice magic".    Deuteronomy 18: 9 - 13    There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer, or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead.  For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you.  You should prove yourself faultless with Jehovah your God.    Acts 18: 18 - 19    And many of those who had become believers would come and confess and report their practices openly. Indeed, quite a number of those who practiced magical arts brought their books together and burned them up before everybody.

o3GTW8i5aa	Hello Cristoiglesia .  Sola Scrptura is by it's nature dysfunctional.   Taken literally, each line of scripture generally can be contradicted by one or more other lines of scripture should one actually study The Bible and have the desire to do so.    I had the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with anti-Catholic Christians where I often listened to their proclamations.   I then contradicted each line of scripture they quoted as proof of their "Catholics are a cult" theme with other lines of scripture which, when read literally, as those who follow sola scriptura believe them to be read, proved we Catholics do follow the teachings, messages and practices of Christ and do so by His authority.    I was always able to prove my point in this manner.   However, with few exceptions, these discussions always ended with the "anti Catholic(s)" leaving the table, sometimes violently, while proclaiming how I and my Church were the anti-Christ and the false prophets scripture warns us to beware of.   Using Scripture in the manner sola scriptura dictates it be used proved to be sola scriptura's own downfall.    When all else failed them and my scriptually proven arguments upheld my faith, their only recourse was to drag out the standard "fallback plan" of accusations and insults (and their leaving).    The Bible must be read in context.   It is composed of many books written by hundreds of people over thousands of years and of differing cultures.   Bending certain select lines to uphold your beliefs as superior to another's is not only foolish, it also goes against all the messages Christ teaches us.    We Catholics are often falsely referred to as idol worshipers due to our reverence of The Virgin Mary and The Saints.   While I absolutely believe everyone has the right to worship God in the manners he/she is most comfortable with, for myself, sola scriptura amounts to worshiping The Bible above God and the messages of Jesus.    Were I to follow the belief of sola scriptura (which, itself is found nowhere in The Bible), I feel I would truly be an idol worshiper.    Thank you for this excellent question and regards,        Lenny.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	It's just another heresy in a long list of heresies that the Spirit of the Antichrist instituted in order to cause the over 30,000 schisms you refer to.  It's the ago-old tactic of divide and conquer (Matthew 12:25).  so the poster who talks about 'truth in unity' is actually mistaken, because Jesus told us that there would be division (Luke 12:51).      Now what really amazes me is that one poster said "The bible tells us all we need to know".    Well, open your bible and go to1 Timothy 3:15.  Here, I'll copy paste it for you to save you the trouble of dusting yours off:    "if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth."    The apostle does not refer to 'scripture' as the pillar and foundation of truth now does he?    Jesus Christ: 1  Anti-Christ: 0    EDIT:  Then this other one says: "The RCC is not the church founded at Pentecost. So your whole question is basically pointless"    Oh really? So you are calling Jesus a liar now?  Let's look at Matthew 16:18    "I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church; and the gates of Hades will not overpower it."    So according to you the gates of Hades overpowered the church and it's all gone now.  So now we are all on our own?    Not sure where you get your ideas from, but from what I have read in the bible, God has ALWAYS kept his word.    Now let's see what the score is...    Jesus Christ: 2  Anti-Christ: 0|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Perhaps we should return to the heretical days of selling indulgences.|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Neither inside nor outside of Catholicism can anyone know if an interpretation is correct.  This makes the Bible useless, and logic says God would not use such an ineffective vehicle.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Makes it pretty obvious. Unless you think that hundreds of conflicting manmade denominations that can't agree on a single doctrinal belief can somehow represent truth. Truth can exist only in unity, which is why Christ gave special graces to the leaders of the Church He founded, telling them "whatsoever you bind upon earth is bound in heaven", and "the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth", and "he who hears you hears Me".  Which is why His Church remains united in belief, united in teaching and united in worship 2,000 years later, while unauthorized manmade denominational religion continues to fragment into more and more conflicting sects every year.|`|JWjlyztBaa	Not necessarily.  There were schisms prior to the advent of the Catholic church.  The Church asserted authority to provide the exclusive  interpretation of the Bible to address this lack of unity.  An act that was not sanctioned by God IMO.  *************    EDIT 2:    This thesis sums up my point in response to your question.  I recognize your points:        "...The principal effect of gnosticism on Christianity was to so distort the person of Jesus as to make him quite different from the Jesus recorded in the gospels.         The popularity of these heretical movements ultimately forced Christianity to develop a structured organization, and to clarify and formulate beliefs. Thus, the first notable steps in the development of what was called the Catholic Church were taken.         The word, Catholic (meaning, universal), as applied to the Church, was first used in the letter of Ignatius to the church in Smyrna. He declared, Wherever Jesus Christ is, there is the Catholic Church. The term is also found in a letter from the church in Smyrna written about AD 155, describing the martyrdom of Polycarp. By the end of the second century, the word carried with it the dual meaning of universal and orthodox.         In response to heresy, an administrative system developed which centered around the bishops. The first episcopate, as distinct from presbyterate, appears in the Epistles of Ignatius. From the beginning, presbyterate and bishop were interchangeable terms with a plurality in every church. The bishop became a characteristic feature of the Catholic Church and fell into different ranks according to the ecclesiastical and political importance of his district."     http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prair...    *****************  edit: (1)    The word Catholic wasn't used at the Pentecost Father.  And why the thumbs down?    "Around the year A.D. 107, a bishop, St. Ignatius of Antioch in the Near East, was arrested, brought to Rome by armed guards and eventually martyred there in the arena. In a farewell letter which this early bishop and martyr wrote to his fellow Christians in Smyrna (today Izmir in modern Turkey), he made the first written mention in history of "the Catholic Church." He wrote, "Where the bishop is present, there is the Catholic Church" (To the Smyrnaeans 8:2). Thus, the second century of Christianity had scarcely begun when the name of the Catholic Church was already in use."    http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/chur...      ******************  EDIT 3    In conclusion I stand by my original short and concise statement.  I find it off putting that a man of the cloth cannot refrain from the knee jerk thumbs-down expected from the disrespectful trolls here.  You are a contact of mine.    BTW, the canonical Bible came AFTER the schisms noted in the thesis that necessitated the purging of heresy by the Church.    http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02543a.h...|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Does the heresy of Sola Scriptura prove that the Bible cannot be understood outside the Church?    Obviously not.      2) Is this the fruit of a false doctrine of men?    Well, perhaps.  Obviously, "sola scriptura" *is* a false doctrine.  Let's look at it logically    a) the only source of Christian doctrine is Scripture  b) there is no Scripture that states that the only source for Christian doctrine is Scripture    Logically, *if* you believe "sola scriptura", you *also* have to believe that the doctrine of sola scriptura is a false doctrine.      3) How could there have been schisms before the Catholic Church when the Catholic Church was founded at Pentecost and was the first and only Church for a millenium?    Probably they were referring to the Roman Catholic Church, not the early catholic church of the Roman Empire.      4) I cannot find ANYevidence that there was any other Church but the Catholic Church that was founded by Jesus and the apostles.    Here you seem to be ignoring all of the churches which soundly assert apostolic succession.  ALL of the Eastern Orthodox churches  ALL of the Oriental Orthodox churches  Assyrian Church  etc. etc.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com|`|EPFLsEAVaa	"Bullis Shitimus ad Mundi"|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	No, it just shows that people can't agree on anything.|`|sV2GO85Xaa	how do you know yours isn't false?|`|zMcHYQeBaa	no    The Bible tells us all we need to know|`|xo1fabj6aa	Sola scriptura is not heresy. The RCC is not the church founded at Pentecost. So your whole question is basically pointless. The books of the Bible being put into one book may have come 350 years later but long before then the churches had the individual books. I truly think the Catholic church needs to read the scriptures on pride. Do you truly think Jesus approves of your haughty better than any other Christian attitude?|`|AcLjARwyaa	I would have to say yes.  I think an argument can be made that it is possible to read and understand the Bible outside of the church, but adhering to sola scriptura, proves that one does not understand the bible.  I certainly dont ever mean to downplay the importance of scripture, particularly when I call protestants to task for the false doctrine of sola Scriptura.  Scripture is vital to salvation, in fact the sacraments are living scripture.  So, scripture and the church are tightly coupled.  certainly the church could exists without Scripture, however one of her functions is to spread the good news, so there tightly coupled.  What do think Father?  I'm just a guy., trying to evangelize.    Pray for me and my fiance we need it.  Thank you..

w8uUWK03aa	I wonder why I'm the only person to take-on this question? Mmmm... OK, I think most of us will have to admit to a bit of "stalking" of someone in our past.  We get smitten by some adonis that happens to cross our path and rather than bite the bullet and ask them out for coffee, we scurry around in the periphery trying to find out more about them, so we can be sure of whether to approach them or not.    I don't think you should delay for too much longer before you do or say something.  Take in to account that he has been visiting you at the store frequently.  Does anyone else visit as frequently?? He is very friendly and fun with you.  How does that compare with other customers??    It sounds to me as if he is trying to become your friend, but you are not taking the bait.  How much longer will he try before giving up?  I know it's unnerving, but what have you got to loose?  Oh well a customer maybe, but you could gain a friend!  So how about the next time he comes in to the store you ask him to go for a coffee and a donut in your break and see how it goes from there... go out to a movie, grab a burger... it's called dating.  Give it a go!  Good luck!    ADDENDUM:  I see from your more recent question that you have started communication with this guy and you're Facebook friends... I would say it's time to take the plunge NOW!  Ask for some technique tips on fellatio or something!

You are who you are. You need to find people you like to be around, who make you proud of who you are. Not necessarily sex partners, but friends. And you should talk to a therapist.    You can't make yourself straight. Being gay is part of who you are. You're born that way. It's not a decision.|`|mHGvAc9kaa	Don't give up who you are.   Gay guys are so much nicer then Straight.

We are all born with, or develop early in life, our sexual orientations.  There are some out there who claim they can "cure" homosexuality, but you should be cautious of these claims.  All major psychological, psychiatric and medical associations have said efforts to change ones sexual orientation were ineffective at best and damaging at worst.    Have faith.  The right person will come into your life.  Don't change who you are for the sake of others.    Good luck to you!|`|61315c556c8efa34d1991d342fa8b948aa	become bi-sexual|`|yegDdZfRaa	Don't get advice here - you need to talk to someone who understands your situation.    http://www.dontwanttobegay.com/    Truth is not always popular, but it's always right.

Just like gay and lesbian people don't choose to be attracted to people of the same gender, straight people don't choose to be attracted to the opposite. As for the straight people not finding you attractive, it's probably because they are straight hun and find chicks hot and not other dudes :) Just be yourself, find more gay guy friends to hang around with and eventually you'll find someone who loves you :D|`|q9yGiIPUaa	Ok for one you can choose what you want to be but that does not make you happy. If men make you happy then that's is just who you are. Example I'm female I love the male species so if I was told only females wanted me I may choose to do it but I sure wouldn't be happy with my choice. In other words you do what you want but eventually what you REALLY want will catch up to you.

So what do you do?    The answer to your question is in your question. You are tired. What do we do when we are tired? We stop.    So stop being in the rut you are in. Stop being with people that find you unattractive and find people that find you attractive. Take a rest from these people and find some new friends, find some gay friends that will appreciate you for the wonderful person that you are, that will give back to you, rather than just taking from you all the time.    Another thing I would like you to do, and I know this sounds silly, but give it a try; at the end of each day, imagine everyone that you have had contact with for the day, particularly those that might have been negative, and imagine that you have left a little bag of your energy at their feet, it is all shiny and golden, they have not touched it in any way. What I want you to do is pick up that little bag of  pure golden energy, some might be bigger than others, and give that energy back to yourself. When you have done this, I want you to thank all of those people, even the negative ones, for letting you take your energy back to yourself.    I think you will find that you will start to feel a little better about yourself.|`|pXVdEZCNaa	awww :( dont worry bud u will find someone soon! u seem like someone special and dont worry be or something  but dont change who u r if ur not going to be happy|`|72rbetinaa	What makes you think that you'll never be loved?

If after a few months of psychology and ssRIs, you still want to have a straight identity, you can try striking it out on your own, or Christian groups can give you referals to reprogramming ministeries. They use techiniques designed for pedosexuals and people with destructive fetishes, and they'll use aversion therapy to try to make homosexual encounters seem repugnant.

1YdeUn1Caa	I disagree. I feel it is lack of parenting. Parents want to have kids, but when they have them, they refuse to raise them properly. They let the streets do it instead of doing it themselves. They don't want to discipline, so they let them continue to run wild and swear like you said.   They are always buying them x-box's instead of letting them play outside like us normal kids did when we were younger. Yes, we got a few scrapes, but mom always patched them up and out to play we went again., No big deal. Now a scrape is like a death sentence. So parents bottle them up inside, until the kid eventually has enough and goes off on their own. How times have changed.|`|NENdAfDLaa	Unfortunately, there are some people who have a much more morbid outlook on society than you. I am one of them. I personally do not see any future for kids.

The world has degraded like this many times before now. The people of the  ancient roman times standards became very degraded just before the fall of the roman empire. Over time their standards and morals improved again. The same thing will happen to society today. Empires will fall and new ones will take there place. The end of one society is merely the beginnings of another.

It's extremely common for gay guys, especially during their high school and college years, to date girls exclusively because they're denying their true nature in hopes that their same-sex attractions are temporary.  But the fact that he entered an actual relationship with a guy while seeing you doesn't leave much room for optimism.  Most girls who think they're bisexual when they're young wind up being totally straight, but there's still a really negative stigma about homosexuality for guys, so even if he claimed he was bisexual, odds are he's going to realize he's gay in a few years.  It would be risky to get back with him if he'd cheated on you with a girl, but I'd guess the risk is at least double because of the likelihood he's gay.  If you take him back, he could be using you to deny his orientation.  I recommend you still be friendly with him, but don't make him your boyfriend again.|`|HmJOZbiYaa	leave him gay people are worthless.|`|PSzzjf4naa	Have a talk about what was hidden from you , and that it was not respectful of you .

Just approach God with all the questions of your heart and trust that with time He will answer them all.     As you learn to grow with Him, your eyes will open, and you will begin to see what is "sin", and what is "holy". We are ALL sinners, even that person you think is perfect. So it's not about being perfect, it's about knowing that even with all your imperfections, God loves you dearly, and will always. Open your heart to Him and watch Him better your life. Second step is reading His word (bible). Last step will be to get to a good bible based church (pray about where to go)    God changed my life, and I am soo happy.

And you obviously have a big ego.  That makes two right there:      -------------------------    If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. If we claim we have not sinned, we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives.  ~1 John 8-10 (NIV)      To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else, Jesus told this parable: "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other menrobbers, evildoers, adulterersor even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.'     "But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'     "I tell you that this man, rather than the other, went home justified before God. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."    ~Luke 18:9-14 (NIV)|`|3ZzlrChgaa	Check out the 10 commandments.

"You are right in saying that God is one and there is no other but him. 33To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices."

AA12383652	99% if women are going inactive?  Is this just a sarcastic over exaggeration?        Women in the church actually put the pressure on themselves.  I have seen it sooo many times.  They feel like they need to be the perfect mothers, perfect in their callings, perfect wives, hostesses, perfect students in school, perfect everything.    Nobody is perfect.  Nobody can be perfect.  I have sat in many Relief Society lessons where they have actually tried to stress this fact to woman.      Still women like getting the feeling of validation when everything goes as plan and they are doing everything right.  Women can get paranoid and think other people are judging them when in reality, nobody is.  (well in the church sometimes people are but everyone knows who the gossips are and dont tend to take them too seriously, lol)      On top of that there is a feeling to give an outward appearance of perfection to the world, too, to set an example of being the perfect little mormon example.      This is my experience growing up and living in Southern Ca.  I know from talking to many people and just experiences in Utah that in some wards, esp of smaller towns and predominately mormon areas there is a little more of the gossiping and judging that comes from stupid human nature.  You are "competing" against more people to be the best, after all.|`|AA12365543	You could that about any religion|`|TwcAQPupaa	I would have to agree with cadisney.  But I'm just wondering...where is your source?  99% of women going inactive?  Even for a short period of time, I find that hard to believe.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	I think that number is a tad bit over exaggerated.   I have been a Mormon for my entire life, and in no way has there been that many members go inactive in any congregation I have been a part of.  And I am talking over many many years, not just 6-12 months time.    How common is it?  I would say from personal experience, less than 5%.|`|2ZO7vFC1aa	I don't think she's saying that 99% of women go inactive, but rather that it seems to her that 99% of the people that go inactive are women.  I'm not sure about that either, but she's not saying 99% of women are inactive.    There are a variety of reasons why people (who still believe and have a testimony of the church) go inactive.  A member of my stake presidency recently told a story of how he and his wife went inactive many years ago.  They had just moved to a new area and they just decided not to go to church the first Sunday they were there (with every intention to go the next week).  When the next week came around, the didn't go.  And each week, it got harder and harder until about 2 months passed.  They never intended to stop attending, they just "took a break" one week and it turned into 8 weeks.  After 8 weeks, their new Bishop visited them and invited them to church.  They went and have been active ever since.    This is just one example, I have no doubt there are a plethora of reasons why someone that still has a testimony might go inactive for a period.      My father is currently inactive, but I know he has a testimony.  He was offended and stopped attending.  He wants to start attending now, but it's hard to go back that first time after not attending for a couple years.|`|no3R6AFzaa	I think inactive women are more prominent on here because the men seem to lose interest in religion altogether or turn atheist.  But I've seen many people go inactive who claim they still believe in the church but don't want to follow the regulations.  A girlfriend of mine used that same phrase, "I need a break from the church."  But she was cheating on her husband with men and women and drinking a lot.  It seems that the pressure of all those rules and the callings in the church really drag on a person.  I've found that many who do fall away will also fall into a rebellious period where they will do all the things they've always wanted to do but couldn't.  A lot of them do so in secret and don't explain it to their family or friends.  Sometimes a person like my friend gets punished by the church to not take the sacrament so they feel embarrassed that people will see them not take it and don't go back until their punishment is up.  But it's good to not generalize on why everyone does this; when I left the church it wasn't because I had "sinned" but I got a lot of people who just assumed it was me that did something wrong if I left the church.  My spouse cheated on me several times and is still a good standing member of the church so it must've been me who messed up right?  I went inactive after that for a while until I realized the church wasn't for me and I left it all together.  But many go back and I know many who are very active members who don't believe in the church but stay because of their friends and family or they might lose their jobs etc...|`|jdRKZe18aa	First of all you need some perspective here. 99% and women? WHere do you come up with these stats?  I think you need to just consider the fact that FEW people in FEW churches attend church as MUCH or as regularly as LDS people do.  Belonging to MOST churches doesn't require or expect much of a person generally.  If you aren't at church on any given Sunday most people wouldn't think much of it nor notice in most other churches or congregations.  You wouldn't typically feel bad for missing church nor would you feel it would make much difference if you were there every Sunday or not - right?    When you are LDS things are expected of you. ALmost every member holds a specific and personal calling in the church in some auxilliary organization.  Either teaching, leading music, being a class president, a primary childrens teacher - there are hundreds of callings that members of every ward holds and when we are NOT there each Sunday it IS noticed, it IS felt and our absense or attendence DOES make a difference.    There's no getting around the fact that being LDS can be quite demanding.  We are NOT a "Burger King" church , nor are we a church of convenience,  apathy or laziness.  We revere a strong work ethic, we honor service to others, we expect a lot of ourselves and believe the Lord does too if we are to be "HIS", His followers, His disciples, His servants, His Children.    Inactivity happens in EVERY church but is noticed and more within the LDS Faith.  A rest?  Heck I need a rest from LIFE, the church, my family, my kids, my job - WHO doesn't need a REST?  SO sure sometimes people feel there is PRESSURE to be perfect or be MORE than they feel able to be or give at certain times in their lives.  Been there, done that!   Explain?  I'm sure everyone does this in there own personal way.  HOW DOES any believing person explain to their families that they have LOST THEIR WAY and need a break from the Gospel, or church, or maybe God?   Very gently I would hope...|`|AA11713693	I do not know but it is very sad to see this happen. Don't they know that they are throwing away a golden opportunity to share something that no one else has in their lives? I love sharing the true gospel of Jesus Christ with everybody I see that don't have the gospel of Jesus Christ in their lives.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	The church does ask a lot of it's members.  Some times people walk away from those things for a while.  It's human nature.  Most of us slack of at work, school, or in our relationships from time to time.|`|WyICbuPqaa	I think the actual numbers are closer to 50%.  Both of my parents went inactive after joining the church, but I don't believe that is typical.  Conversion takes time in many cases.  My sisters didn't come back to church until I had returned to church and was sent on a mission.  My parents didn't start coming back to church until I had returned from my mission.  Faith takes time to grow.      Meanwhile, the adversary does everything within his power to dissuade people from keeping the commandments of God, and from attending church.  I remember the first time we had a Family Home Evening in our home.  It was a new experience, and put us all together as a family.  As children, we responded like we were conditioned to respond - we fought, argued, bickered and complained.  It was our first and last Family Home Evening.  Our parents didn't have the faith to see it through.  We didn't have the love of God - we hated each other.  We desparately needed Family Home Evening as evidenced by our lack of family love, but didn't have the faith to get through the transistion period.    Most people look at commandments as restrictions on our behaviour mandated by God.  Most people would prefer to choose for themselves what commandments, if any, they would like to keep.  They look at God as if he was some overbearing despot trying to control every aspect of our lives.  In the LDS church, we are taught that every blessing is conditioned upon obedience to a commandment.  We believe the commandments are not arbitrary, but designed to bring us joy and peace by their application.  The commandments of God don't restrict us - they free us from the shackles of Satan, and allow us to enjoy great blessings which we otherwise never would have had.  This subtle change of attitude requires faith and spiritual growth, but results in a people who love the commandments and love righteousness.    So some people jump into the cold waters of a lake, and quickly jump out again unprepared for the transition in temperature.  If their friends remain, they will usually get over their fear and jump in again.  Some people expect that there will be a transistion period when they convert to a new church, and have the faith to continue doing what they know is right, in spite of the initial akwardness.  For others, the process is more difficult than their faith will support, and conversion may take awhile, if it happens at all.    My parents became inactive, but never stopped believing that it was the true church of God.  Perhaps it was more a lack of faith in themselves.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I would guess that since they are not born again, and since the church is demanding too and doesn't help them, they drop out, but it is sad that they don't focus on what they should be doing instead.  I really think the church has them in so much bondage that they are afraid to leave the church all together and join a true church of Jesus Christ.  But then again, they are probably so confused that they have no idea whether there is a true church and if someone would tell them about it, they would have their doubts so these people need prayer.|`|7VJcd5YLaa	If what you are saying is  99% represents the general membership - think about this and then go to a parking lot of an LDS chapel on Sunday - for every woman you see there - there are 99 sitting at home - not likely a valid stastic on those notes.    As for pressure - people will use any old excuse to put the blame on another person - she offended me - he told me this - they put too much pressure - so and so won't cut their kids' hair - any old excuse will work when someone really looks for one.    Pressure is an excuse.  If people feel pressure - and are not living up to a standard they perceive to be the Ideal Supermom - they need to look at their lives and rethink things - after all, we are not commanded to be perfect in this life - and I have never heard anyone preaching that women are to be the do it all, know it all, be everything, do everything that those who scream - pressure - say.    Isn't it ironic though - either people say that too much pressure to perform is placed on LDS women, or the absolute opposite - they are repressed, dominated and left out of everything - my personal experiences in the church and in life are - when things are two polar extremes - look in the middle and more moderate areas - therein lies the truth.|`|3K51tgQWaa	Because they're fortunate enough to catch on to the bull sh*t.

However, there remains a strong anti-Roman Catholic sentiment among certain Protestant sects that has been handed down for the last 500 years.    As for the Muslims - well, you would be wrong.  Many Muslims are quite vehement about the heretical nature of other sects of Muslims.  The bombings in Iraq are a clear case in point - frequently sectarian in nature.  But there are far more than merely Sunnis and Shiites, and the lesser-known Muslim sects are frequently severely criticized by leaders and individuals of better-known sects.    Then, of course, there is Buddhism.  Don't believe they don't have internal strife?  Read about the Buddhist temple wars in Japan - astounding.    SO, really, most Christian sectarian strife is mild in comparison to what we see - and have seen - in other religions.  The only really significant Christian sectarian strife over the last century has been the Northern Ireland problem.  Most other large religious groups cannot make that claim.

They simply don't like the world-view evolution suggests and refuse to even consider the idea. As the proverb goes: There's no blinder than he who refuses to see.    Incidentally, I was in Canada last summer. There's a lake near the city of Gatineau which was cut off from the sea some 10 000 - 30 000 years ago. They've found a salt-water fish which lived in it, even though it was now a fresh water lake. It's a sub-species of its salt-water cousin. Neither could survive in each other's environment today, but the lake fish has gradually adopted a fresh-water breathing system because desalinization occurred gradually.|`|AA12257580	The best evidence of evolution in action is the fact that we have to get an influenza vaccine year after year.|`|8ibIQu2eaa	The creationists won't be happy till a fish gives birth to a elephant.|`|Fpi8im9taa	Oh please, creationists think that bacteria developing a resistance to certain medications isn't evidence of evolution.

Dunfee, former professor of physics at the University of Maine at Farmington:    One wonders why, with all the evidence, the (Godless) theory of evolution still persists.

Polls have shown that about 40% of scientists acknowledge a supernatural power. But the majority of the scientific community, especially evolutionary leaders today, hold an atheistic worldview.

2EvkFausaa	Guess what honey: the bigger a woman's breasts are, the more aesthetically pleasing it is to look at them, suck on them, lick them, squeeze them, and best of all, bury your face into them and feel them engulfing your face (it is especially amazing to bury your face into that valley she has between her breasts. Hmm. so sexy!). Yes, it really does matter how big they are, but I honestly don't think a woman HAS to have big breasts. I think as long as she's got a handful, that's big enough. But like if she has small breasts, or worse yet, is flat chested, that is a massive turnoff and a total dealbreaker. With small breasts, it's like, "what am I grabbing?" And when I stuff my face into her chest, I get NO pleasure out of it cause there's virtually nothing to rub my face against and she barely has that womanly valley that I love to enrapture myself in.    It seems to me like you are upset that you have only a 34A (LOL). Sucks to be you.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	its not gross. i like my boobs.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I don't think it's gross.

I mean straight guys love them because they are one of our erogenous zones and it's normal for them to be attracted to our breast.|`|DfDss68haa	They are not gross. They serve a purpose- to feed and nourish babies. The problem is when society began making them into sexual objects by covering them up and hiding them and only taking them out during porno.     In tribal societies the breasts are treated very casually out in the open and that's how it should be. We make fun of them for having saggy breasts or being "immoral" but they had the right idea. We have made our body into something to be ashamed of, something dirty in Western society and used the excuse that our body "is our temple." Wow I think I might be a nudist.    With that being said, bigger breasts are valued in women by men in many societies and for good reason. We are all subconciously attracted to what will further the species. We are animals when you get right down it and if we are attracted to another person, it is becuase that someone is a good biological fit for our genes and will produce healthy fit offspring and we sense this. Women are biologically programmed to be attracted to men who are strong and have shown they can provide for the family.    Big breasts, in this context, are seen as showing that the woman is ready for the responsibilities of breeding and child bearing. Milk=breasts to men, even though small breasts produce the same amount of milk. So I suppose they are sexual in a way but not to the extent that we have made them by oversexualizing what amounts to a bunch of fat tissue.|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	The biggest reason is because they're always covered up.

Its wired in my brain to think this way.|`|Sej3YHDTaa	well?... its just that guys like breasts because  its just Hot to look at and the most attractive part of a womans body besides their rear end, but yeah women are just as hornier as men are. so they just want to look their best to get the man to sleep with them or at least to have a boyfriend perhaps?    p.s when women get older with large breasts it tends to get saggy.   no offence, i like big breasts but i like the medium or small breasts even better ^_^|`|khUcAjgIaa	Don't forget, we love butts too!|`|c4AH1h5eaa	i personally think that what is on the inside is more important than big boobs.|`|wF2G3Krcaa	Yeah, I think it's weird. People would always tell me I'm blessed because of mine, but I found the one man that couldn't care less if I had double d's or a's. I have double d's.|`|SEBcylvuaa	personally I prefer booty. t!tt!es are nice but only if you already have the booty|`|qZPAMEp2aa	I like them, but I also think fat is incredibly sexy. That said, I don't understand why it's sexy in the breast, but not the waist. Either way, it's still fat.

vUxoQxBhaa	Dearest friend,    I think everyone could find true love. But we must live each step at a time. When you become an adult, you'll have more oportunities than now. But the real questions are:     - Would true love last forever?   - Or it'll be forever during the time it last?    Think about it  =***|`|NzuIHF5Iaa	idk|`|LnrPDF5Gaa	if you look like a gymnast then you wouldnt have a problem finding "true love"|`|i2QUf6JMaa	lol at the first dude|`|I759qzWkaa	Hey im a gymnast! and i used to play wow.  lol.  But im not really looking for a relationship just yet due to the fact no one knows for sure if i am gay.  I've been called it, and yelled at for it, and such, but know one has heard it from my mouth yet.  Hopefully soon!|`|OWr4EpmAaa	Hey sweetie.  True love will come. Usually when you least expect it and couldn't care less.    First step is to learn to love yourself.  This is the vital step to true, lasting fulfilment.  I mean be kind to yourself, know that you deserve good things, be independent. You will be secure and love will be true and unconditional.    Then the magic really happens!  Your special love will walk straight at you and sweep you off your feet!    Best of luck x|`|n7OHi5NAaa	I dunno but I think geeks are cute|`|otiBw8WYaa	Look in the mirror|`|cGpC8547aa	Yes. :) everyone finds someone and you just have to wait till that moment happens. It takes time :)|`|71OkuYzRaa	yes  try making friends with straight guys    It really weird when ur friends all of a sudden turn gay or bi
HH90Eghaaa	Lol, no contrary to popular belief many straight males just aren't attracted to lesbians! After all they just can't get anywhere with them!|`|GkO45d7uaa	Hahaha!! I have that same problem with guys. And I would say that many guys are intimidated by a strong woman. As for getting those women off your backs... send them to me :)    Edit: It is flattering to me, too, but it's not the attention I want right now.|`|oXRZfAWaaa	Do you wear flannel shirts often?  Army boots?|`|H5CdsnByaa	Yes men are starting to find that a turn off. It confuses them when you don't want them to hold your books. It makes them mad when you can actually do that math problem yourself or by some miracle you found out how to step around or step over that puddle of water and he didn't even have to throw his coat down. And he feels he doesn't have a place when you actually KNOW you don't look fat in the dress so you don't ask him. So if you want more guys you're gonna have to feed their egos and make them feel manly. There's nothing wrong with that though. We all like to feel needed.|`|jjj6n5fEaa	No.   I speak about myself. if I see a too good looking woman, then I might not try to get close to her because my thought is well she is so beautiful and for sure she has a partner. It looks impossible that such a beautiful girl stays without a boyfriend, so I might don't take a chance. Also I used to be very attentive to good looking women, but unfortunately they mostly tended to keep distance and ignore me. So, based on my past experience, and unconciousnesly, I some times take a preemptive action and ignore them before they ignore me. I know it might not demonstrate a high self confidence, and I am working on that and try to control such sudden reactions.|`|otiBw8WYaa	Well become a lesbian so we can kiss! LOL!          Just kidding....

The american car companies should not get help as they are inefficient.  Asian car companies have set up factories in the american southeast, and the citizens there would benefit greatly from the added business, not to mention the benefits to the consumer if we don't prop up mismanaged manufacturing companies.
6SwaWSoyaa	I think you meant why is it so difficult for parties in the untied states to not always disagree and not compromise? Am I correct? We aren't third world, because we don't use constant force on each other. Dictating countries have proven to worsen a country. Plus we always disagree because being american you are grown up to be opinionated and not to be ever wrong. Also there is quite a lot of diversity here which causes much disagreements between each other. I think that makes our country very interesting. However that doesn't mean we are never united, because we are and it showed on September 11th.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	it isn't difficult at all. happens all the time|`|pC1rRb9Oaa	well, thats the heart of politics. We are in a time when desicions become more vital, so it becomes more difficult to make desicions.
9FIvoZQaaa	You are absolutely correct!  In today's society, email is a much more appropriate way of communicating. This is especially true if you work outside of a "traditional" office.  I would send her an email in the morning. Start off by saying that you just wanted to make sure she had your correct email address, apologize again for what happened, remind her that you don't stop by the office often, and encourage her to email important announcements to you in the future. You could even offer a list of convenient days for you to have a student nurse shadow you. Close the email with a list of your contact information...just in case she misplaced it.|`|gvgFfPwQaa	COmpletley correct! My boss used to be a complete b*tch to me too!|`|Iot2A1YRaa	yes definetely, how were you supposed to know if you had that responsibility if your main means of communication is email or phone? If there is a schedule board and you are discouraged from showing up to the office everyday, everymorning, that should also be in writing, that any imporant information will be e-mailed per say. Why couldnt they e-mail the scheule? then the responsibility would have fallen on you for not checking it. I would say write your manager a follow up e-mail asking what is correct procedure to find out when you have a student nurse assigned to you if you are discouraged from showing up at the office everymorning?  a good manager will follow the lines of communication to avoid confussion in the work place and if she gets upset and gets you in trouble for it then at least you are covered.

ZE6RWhk4aa	Certainly, as long as it's halal. My research has led me to conclude that instruments are fine (although i wouldn't get on anyone's case if they decided not to listen to instruments, as that's not haram either), and as long as the lyrics and rhythms are halal it's not a problem as long as I don't listen to excess. But being excessive in anything is disapproved of in islam.|`|7zo0ZOThaa	Yea Son,  i listen to Music|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Yes.    How can you watch a movie without listening to its soundtrack?|`|WmU7jhObaa	Nasheed, Tarana only. no Demonic nonsense necessary.    can someone proof me wrong when i says MUSIC IS A TOOL OF BRAINWASHING?|`|kkO87h0Xaa	No, I don't.|`|eysDi4rIaa	Yeah... I don't think it is haraam to listen to Miley Cyrus|`|CU2eG18kaa	Funny u ask, bc I recently asked this too. Im trying soooooooo hard to change my life and be the best Muslim I can, so I stopped listening to music like only last week. I like what someone said for my question,  "No one can handle the love of both music and the Glorious Quran."  I agree!|`|gDksphD0aa	A day without music is like a day without sunshine not worth getting up for.|`|ZOFM0g9haa	Yes I do cuz I'm not hard of hearing.  When I'm going to the mall, there's music being played in the background, I have no choice but to listen to it. When I'm watching the news they have this short mini intro songs, still no choice. I can hear therefore, I listen... :D|`|OPFsDMk5aa	I am trying to stop. I took all the music off my mp3 player and replaced it w/ Quran and lectures... but I have yet to take off the Disney music and PS2 soundtracks :{    For some dumb reason I just can't bring myself to totally delete all my music files from my computer... I mean taking it off my mp3 player is one thing but just in case I feel like kapowing someone I could always listen to my gazillion songs that I spent so long compiling non-illegally :P    All the dumb things music has done to me:  1. wasted my time download songs/burning cds  2. wasted money buying a crappy $100 mp3 player that broke  3. prevented me from doing my homework  4. daydreams upon daydreams upon daydreams upon daydreams...  5. watched stupid haram music videos  6. wasted 1 hour a day playing a cello, and thousands of dollars buying the instruments (for orchestra)  7. countless cds and cassettes that were a waste of money  8. the music gets stuck in my head alot and drives me nuts all day  9. and yet I still can't bring myself to click DELETE :P    but I will insha'Allah. I mean it's not like I'm jumping off a cliff or anything.    ...right? :P    Salam :)    EDIT:    Yes, music is 200% haram    "The Almighty Allah has prohibited the manufacture of all such things that are exclusively used in Haraam ways; and things that only create evil like pipe, flute, chess and all types of instruments of gambling, images, statues. The manufacture of all such articles is Haraam."  Imam (a.s.) concluded, "Then even learning to sing or play music and teaching it, to sing and play music, to be paid for these things or to be in any way engrossed in these vices is Haraam    Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.) reports from the Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) that he said:   "I prohibit for you dancing and playing flute, drums and tabla."   (Al Kafi)    The Holy Prophet (s.a.w.s.) has also said,   "The Almighty Allah has sent me as a mercy to the worlds, to guide the people. And He ordered me to eradicate the playing of flute and other instruments of music, all games of vice, idol (worship) and all practices of the days of ignorance."  (Mustadrakul Wasael, Chapter 79)    The Sixth Imam (a.s.) has also stated,   "The playing of violin promotes the growth of hypocrisy in the heart like water assists the growth of vegetation (algae)."   (Wasaelush Shia)    Imam (a.s.) also says,   "If drums and cymbals are played at one's house for forty days, Allah will impose a satan by the name of 'faqandir'. The satans will infiltrate into every cell of the person's body. With the spread of this evil, the person loses all sense of dignity and self-esteem. He will then not care as to what he says or what is said about him. Then, this satan blows into this person. As a result, he becomes utterly shameless. So mush so that he is not concerned or affected even if his women are dishonoured."     (Wasaelush Shia)  It is usually observed that the people in whose homes music is played with regularity either using musical instruments or by radio or cassettes are absolutely shameless and wanton.    Muadda Ibne Ziyad says, "I was in the company of Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.) when a person said, "When I go to the toilet, I can hear the singing girls of my neighbour. Sometimes, I remain (in toilet) longer so that I may listen to more of it."  Imam (a.s.) said:   "Desist from listening to music and songs attentively."   Then this man further said, "Master, I do not go to music gatherings! I only hear the sounds!"  Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq (a.s.) said,   "Have you not read this Quranic verse...   "Surely, the hearing and the sight and the heart, all of these shall be questioned about that?"   (Surah Bani Israel 17:36)   The man replied, "I was not aware of this ayat. I regret my actions. I shall not do so in the future. I repent for my past sins and I seek forgiveness from my Lord."  Seeing his condition, Imam (a.s.) said,   "Get up ! Go and perform ghusl and offer namaz and pray for forgiveness. You have certainly been involved in a deadly sin and a terrible situation. You have repented for it and I thank Allah for that; and I seek forgiveness of Allah for all those things that He dislikes. Certainly, Allah only dislikes the evil things. Leave the evil things to the evil people because there are different people suitable for different things."   (Al Kafi Chapter of Music)    Amirul Momineen Ali (a.s.) says,   "Angels do not even enter a house that has wine, drum, tambourine or a flute. Even the prayers of the inhabitants of this house are unacceptable. They are deprived of barakat."   (Wasaelush Shia)  Hazrat Imam Ali ar-Reza (a.s.) has said,   "To listen to a musical instrument is one of the Greater Sins."   (Mustadrakul Wasael)    A House Where Music is Played for Forty Days  Hazrat Imam Ali ar-Reza (a.s.) remarks,   "A person invites Divine wrath when in his house instruments like flute, drum and chess are played for forty days. If this man dies within these forty days, his death would be of a sinner and a transgressor. His place shall be in Hell. And what a dreadful place it is!"  (Mustanad al Taraqi)    _______________________________    There's alot more on the website, read them, please!! Trust me, you don't need music to study. I know it's hard to stop listening to music especially the pretty flute but really the flute is obnoxious and just makes you feel sad and brings back unwanted memories... *sigh*  Listening to Quran can make you memorize Surahs faster and have better pronunciation :)    You can get great lectures here:  http://www.backtoislam.com/category/free...  and  |`|AA10624860	I used to be obsessed with music!

Just keep yourself preoccupied with better things in life!|`|AA10248239	I used to, but over the years have almost entirely stopped, alhamdulilalh.  I think it's a stage in the development of faith.

In fact every day when I go jogging. I have heard that in Islam music is haram but I don't understand why because the Quran itself is written in poetic verses.   Islam encourages peace and some argue that music and movies come between a person and his faith but if this were truly the case then wouldn't music have been banned a long time ago.   Its not like if music was banned that poverty would suddenly disappear and rape, murder, cruelty, and abuse would be gone.  And for those who have said that music is mockery to Allah then what about those singers who sing in the name of Allah. They praise him and tell other Muslims about our last Prophet (PBUH)|`|wH1So866aa	yea i listen to music everyday... i listen to it as much as i can. what about you?|`|J3UmD1zCaa	Yeah, I can't live without my ipod.|`|CwqW45Rmaa	Honestly? I do listen to music. But I do know it's haram.... Sorry if I'm sounding like a hypocrite, but I do believe it's haram even though I listen to it. I don't mean to preach what I don't practice, but here's why I believe it's forbidden.    The aayaat of the Quraan and the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) indicate that musical instruments are condemned, and warn us against them. The Quraan teaches that playing these instruments is one of the things that leads people astray and constitutes mockery of the Signs of Allaah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):    And of mankind is he who purchases idle talk to mislead (men) from the Path of Allaah, without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allaah, the Verses of the Quraan) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire). [Luqmaan 31:6]    Most of the scholars interpreted lahw al-hadeeth (idle talk) as meaning singing and musical instruments, and every voice that diverts people from the truth.|`|spOAhjcZaa	lol i know its hurdram but i will tell you the Truth NO/la i cant give up  my crapy music|`|xhE79ycEaa	Yes I do.

VGsSxgvjaa	Peace  No worries. Its no sin at all. But make the effort to learn with the help of Allah Almighty. Start with Quranic arabic lessons if you can, and learn the small surahs at the end part of the Quran. I'm in your situation too. Muslims are supposed to acquire knowledge " from the womb to the tomb". Insha Allah you'll succeed. Ameen.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Well, it's not wrong, but I don't think you will appreciate anything much, if you don't understand the language of the memorization.     But, do what you can, and try to understand the beauty of the Qur'an in a language that you're familiar with. The Qur'an is best expressed in its true form, and if you understand that original language, then, all the better.|`|OPFsDMk5aa	If it makes you feel better...  my parents speak Arabic but my Arabic is so choppy that sometimes I don't understand half of what the Surah is saying... but I take Arabic classes :)    Blah my mom says I know Arabic it's just in the back of my head somewhere.

sRvfF732aa	Well... I'm  sure there are quite a few things but I don't really keep them all memorized.  Last week a secretary at my school had a fire and lost everything, I bought her a flower and gave her a card to let her know I was thinking about her.  I give people rides all the time, free of charge, where they would otherwise have to walk in the freezing cold.  Also there are some homeless drunks that hand out around a conveinience store that I go to, they beg for money. most people walk on by, I don't like to give them money because I know they will use it for drugs or alcohol, but sometimes I'll buy them a bag of chips and a pop.   You'd be surprised how moved/grateful they can be for that, these guys are always on the streets and don't get much to eat.
DfBH8Dr9aa	I like to know what is going on so I can beware. I think that New York has always been a place that sounded scary .I wouldn't want to go there alone.It is more dangerous if you are not familiar with the areas.

People in Mumbai (the place I live in), keep talking about Delhi (my hometown) crimes,  forgetting Mumbai is the Hotbed of Sleaze & Gang-wars...where life is cheaper than a bottle of cola.      And when they come to me with such stories,  I don't know whether to laugh or cry!      Not that I condone or underplay crime anywhere...it is what it is!

I have seen people throw their siblings sexuality in their parents face as an attack more then I have ever heard of them saying it because they can't keep a secrete like that.

Having someone you are close to know about it can really help if you ever experience problems because of it or even just for peace of mind.|`|XwFxZLc6aa	Yes, tell him.  He probably has suspicions that you are gay which is why he made it a point for you to hear him say that he would be supportive.  You need all the support you can get when you're coming out.

aO4iCwtoaa	The main image in the essay is that of people basically being a nasty spider, with G-d looking down on us in disgust debating whether to smoosh us.      Hopefully that will help you answer the questions - obviously that is not the view most people have of themselves or of G-d's attitude toward us anymore.|`|IVy35SE2aa	Edwards seem to know a different one than Jesus pointed out to us.  Jesus described Him as a loving Father, not a vengeful despot.    The god depicted in the old Jewish history book was a very  human god who was endowed with all of mans unstable  emotional traits.      If Edwards can get a lot of people to fear God and believe what  Edwards is feeding them; then he will have people willing to  support him all his life as a man who knows god very well.  And that would be partially true - Edwards would know that god  better than anyone else - because Edwards invented him.    If anyone preaches about a God who is something other than  Divine Love, it is time to turn away.  If you are not hearing  about Love and only Love, you are getting false teachings.

JXMVNEQoaa	marijuana has 3 times the amount of tar as cigarettes and causes brain damage along with other illnesses related to the smoke. it should stay illegal.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	marijuana is as harmful as aspirin, so I think that needs to be legalized, it would also very much help our economy    other drugs need to be decriminalized more.  Taking recreational users and throwing them in jail is not a good solution.  We need to model our drug laws after certain European countries that have really solved their drug problems.  The war on drugs is a war that costs the American taxpayers billions of dollars a year (about a TRILLION so far) and is obviously a big failure.|`|2OeWXloQaa	Depends on what kind of illegal drugs. I think the marijuana should become legal, because it's safer then alcohol. I know that's not saying much, but you can't make one legal without the other.   Some hallucinogenics should be legal. The rest should stay illegal. They're addicting and they just get worse over time.|`|KifasiMraa	It depends on the drug and why its been deemed illegal.  Some drugs were made illegal because of racist reasons and bum science.  For instance, there are documented testimonies from people in the early 1900s advocating that pot be made illegal because they believed that pot made Mexican men rape white women.  They also thought heroin made chines men rape white women and cocaine made black men rape white women. Should the drugs be illegal?  Considering the health risks involved, maybe, but then you get in to the argument of whether or not the government should be able to tell people what's ok to put in their bodies (many people believe it should be their choice what to smoke, drink or ingest, many don't) but my point, is these drugs were made illegal for the wrong reasons, and until we can come up with valid and sound reasons to make them illegal, they should be legalized.  Its also believed that if drugs like cocaine were legalized then it could be taxed and regulated and so, would be safer to buy and sell and people wouldn't have to die over drug territory etc. Basically, legalizing some drugs could make many aspects of drug culture safer for everyone. Also worth noting: alcohol is way more dangerous than other illegal drugs, yet is still a legal drug.  There's no logic behind that, and so other drugs less dangerous than alcohol shouldn't be illegal.  No one has ever died from smoking pot. People died form drinking booze all the time. Its not right.

I mean...that can be said. But I think it's more of what feels comfortable. And I'm not saying that because they feel more comfortable being feminine that they should go out and "become" a transgendered person, but I think it's one of those things that just is. Some gay men are "manly", stereotypically of course. Bears! :) Some gay men are flamboyant, stereotypically gay. "Queens", "flaming", etc. It's just who the person is. You can't help that.

I think he probably suspects that you're gay, and is trying to bully you into admitting it.  Do NOT let him force you into something that yorue not ready for.  You could laugh along with him if that helps, but I would just ignore him.  People like that are just shallow and cruel and rude, and there's no reason for anybody to have anything to do with them.

It was so offending, because first of all, I'm not even Chinese. I get SO pissed off when people are like, "Are you Chinese?"... it might be hard to distinguish between Asian races, but seriously, if that's the case they shouldn't even ask.    Oh, by the way, I thought it was true that some Chinese do sell dog meat...? I heard this on television and it said China had 'dog meat ramen' or something, not to be insulting of course.

But to tell the truth, people do get singled out especially if you are the minority. I'm pretty sure if you go to an asian country's school then the minority's are getting made fun of there. I know that in Japan, all the white kids were getting made fun of. There's still lots of ignorant people in this world, not just the United States. And another part of it, is just standing up for yourself. My friends will occasionally kid around and say something but they know not to push it because i'll fight them.

Good Luck|`|iWaU76T5aa	LOL don't forget the Indians (India) either.    Anyways, in many places in the US it is easy for people to discriminate against Asians, why?    1. Asians don't have a lot of gang power and are not looked upon as those who would shoot or beat a person up unlike the Latinos and Blacks. Asians are looked up as peaceful people and thus make easy targets.    2. Asian people only make up 3 percent of America, lowest out of all race groups, Asians number wise are the smallest minority.     Now WHY do people discriminate against Asians so much?    1. Asian kids on average get the best grades in school and the highest SAT scores, this brings out envy from other people and people express their hate by insults.    2. Asian people have the highest average salary out of ALL races groups in America because they perform so well in school and most go on to be doctors and engineers.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Ameri...    3. Most Asian kids do not play sports and are always stuck on books, this brings out the nerd stereotype.       BUT MAINLY, most of the people saying that crap are dumb rednecks who know that     1. If they say anything against someone that is Black, they will get their butts beat    2. If they say anything against someone that is Hispanic, they will get their butts beat.    I can say that out of all race groups in America, Asians are discriminated against the most openly. Whether it be in movies or whether it be in real life, people get away easily by saying racial things against Asian people. Asians pay the price for being intelligent and having more money than everyone else unfortunately.     Well, at least when you finish high school and get a career you won't have to put up with this crap ^_^.    Spanish People and Blacks do not receive any racism at all in public verbally. It is mostly Whites and Asians that receive it.|`|PMRp2ZRlaa	I'm Asian too, and I don't eat dogs, shark,rabbit,gator meat (alligator tail meat) and other weird food that others eat here in America. And I can drive better then most people. (NOTE: If everyone here in the U.S. been overseas and has a European driving experience then I said yes, other then that, I don't have any further comment).    Btw, even the Indians are not originally from America. They came from Siberia and crossed the (ice) bridge that connected Mainland Asia and Northern America during the Ice Age.     Edit: My ex wife (white) told me this once; "to go back where you came from", and I told her that she is ignorant because she don't even know her own history...    Ignorant, low family values,and other problems in life, poor integrity,lack of respect to ones self and others. Above all, education is very important. That's why people hate others (even if they don't know you) because the way they was raised or brought up from home or a society that doesn't have regard in human rights. Remember, everything that we do are individual choice. We can either be bad or good. We just have to pay the consequences which ever road we follow and actions that we do...     Be smart, that's the name of the game...Above all, believed in yourself and God.|`|WYo59zLOaa	You forgot the part they CAN'T DRIVE!|`|s3YmrM9zaa	yes but are you a good driver...|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	all steriotypes are there for a reason. people made it out to be that way. not to say that steriotypes are true, in fact very few are but have some truth in them. now as far as asian guys go. i think asian dudes are awesome. i've dated a few in my day. i liked the exchange student types more so that the american born asian guys because they actually know stuff about their culture. i love learning, and i like everyone unless they (themself, as an individual) gives me a reason not to.|`|OTnSwNwZaa	Actually, people are racist in favor of Chinese. Chinese are seen as intelligent and are often used as a model minority weapon to bash Blacks. Asian girls are also seen as beautiful (I like japanese girls myself) and many asian guys are beginning to be seen as handsome and classy.    Blacks are hated all over the world, and many chinese/other east asians contribute a great deal of that hatred. At least you have your niche, and if it gets too bad, a somewhat decent country to return to.|`|ncdTxID9aa	I think Asians like other minorities try to fight stereotypes, but don't want to speak out when people are racist towards them, other than black people, I don't hear many Hispanics/Latinos, Asians or Middle Eastern people speak up for themselves, so it leaves room for people who are not afraid to stereotype them to do that.  Like Sarah Silverman said "We make fun of people we aren't afraid of"  or in that sense, people openly stereotype or are prejudice against people they aren't afraid of or might not speak up for themselves. I don't have a problem with people based on race.|`|jTkX9HJyaa	Because they're too close-minded to realize that stereotypes aren't for a whole population. Anyways, I'm middle eastern, and people have yet to understand that I'm not going to blow you up.|`|5hbNtQDIaa	i am NOT racist at all. and people who are racist are either inexperienced, had a bad experience with a race, or just dumb for judging an entire race. but im not racist. actually i really like the chinese and japanese culture alot. and its who cares if u live in america were all human it doesnt matter what u look like. and every race looks different for a reason. like african americans originally decended from africa where its very hot so there skin became dark to adapt. and yes its overly proven that every species adapts to there enviroment over time. but the point is were all human who cares if were white, black, aisan, heavy, skinny, european, tall, short, ext. and u r absolutly right native americans were here first, then europeans took over, then someone spread a rumor bout america being so great that everyone wanted to live here. thats basicly it. and we r all related in some way in america. i mean ALL of us decended from somewhere. in other words all americans either had ancesters from europe, china, japan, italy, africa, ext ext. were all mutts here basicaly. so if ur racist againt any race chances r ur racist againt urself and ur ancesters. but so what if ur chinese. i love there culture to be honest and if anyone gives u hard time about it tell them to grow the hell up. who gives a **** what anyone thinks...ur u and thats that. who cares wat u look like. were the same species and that should be enough for us to get along. sadly there r some real retards out there who refuse to accept this and ignore them. ur not alone tho were all mutts. for me im 50% italian and i have some polish, russian, native american, and lots more in me. and everyone in america is like that and if they say they arent there either unaware or in denial. and the stuff u said about urself is cool. but u dont have to prove this to anyone but urself and maybe ppl u love. im italian and im not hairy lol i heard some ppl think we r which is ridicolous, i love anime and thats not in my culture so what, im not a nerd either, i love animals too, ext ext. just laugh at the racist people cus there the ones who make living in this world so stressful for everyone including themselves. just be urself and u will be fine and if someone has a problem with u then tell them to go screw off and worry about themself. im 15 and a girl and im just happy i realized this now than later. hope ive helped u out a bit ^_^|`|VSsCZ2N6aa	Same here.

I didn't know such racism existed towards the Asian population. I love Asians, they are so cute, just like little China dolls, and they have the cutest little soft spoken accent when they speak English. I'm sorry people are so mean, that is just American culture. People are mean to me to and I'm not even Asian, jeez whats my excuse? In one ear and out the other, don't let them bring you down. I think Jeff has erectile disfunction and wants to share his wealth of knowledge, thats all.

I love the black hair and pale skin and exotic eyes, it isn't ugly at all! Also, most Chinese people don't eat dogs, and even if they do, who is everybody else to discriminate against the ways of another's culture? In some countries dogs are considered an animal to eat and that's just the way it is there. Heck, dog is probably a lot better for you then most of the fast food junk Americans stuff down their throats! (Not that I'm saying we should eat dogs. I love dogs, but just making a point). I don't even get why people say the Chinese are poor, they are one of the richest countries with their skills in technology! Isn't it a GOOD thing that Asians have brains? Nerd is such a stupid term I think some people are just jealous because they aren't the brightest bulb in the bunch. I like anime, haha, but I know that all of the Asians who who go to my school don't, so that is just a false assumption. And America is a FREE COUNTRY, anyone who wants to live there has a right to live there. God I hate racists Asians are so cool! It's wrong to be prejudice about someone just based on their race!|`|ry2XcFm6aa	I dunno....but in seriousness really because.. "the man" gave the asians bad stereotypes especially asian men...

Those are all stereotypes to make you feel bad and inferior, ( although in parts of China, dogs are eaten.......but who is to argue about culture, right ?

Think about it. When someone is in a minority, e.g., a person with a scar on his chin, everyone else who doesn't have a scar on their chin will call that single person "strange", "odd", a "weirdo". The majority picks up on the single person's DIFFERENCE and EXAGGERATE it.    That's how we get stereotypes about different kinds of people.    It's ok though. It's all good! Being an individual and unique means you have capabilities, talents, and looks that are SPECIAL, and that means each of us stands apart from another. If all human beings were intended to be the same, we wouldn't have different DNA! God (or some higher power) purposefully CREATED us this way. We are all singular, unique...rare, and therefore, each of us are PRECIOUS -- like a diamond in the rough! :)    The BEST to you! The next time someone says something mean to you, just know that you ARE special and smile and walk on with your head up high, PROUD and TALL.|`|a4Q4vA9Caa	I know what you mean, man. Some people at my school find it funny that I score As in English, especially because they've seen my foreign parents.

No culture is, in particular. It's the individual.  All races have their pros and cons.

mHBSzJxQaa	yes... i think there is something that went on in that house.it has been said that it's proven to be a hoax.However; George Lutz [to your suprise maybe] has gone on record stating that some of the event(s) in the novel and film are untrue and never actually happened.  Quote from amityvillehorrortruth.com :  From the very beginning, it was obvious that many enthusiasts of the 'hoax' theory used the book and movie to garner information about the haunting.  Most people realize in modern times that movies have a way of using literary license, and often over-dramatize or even create totally fictional scenes.  It became such a problem that the phrase 'based on true events', is now standard opening monologue.  When enthusiasts compared the book and movie versions to the Lutz's telling of the events...  things didn't add up.    Funny part is - George Lutz will be the first person to tell you that some of the events portrayed in the book and movie aren't factual.|`|mXYxRsB5aa	I def think it was a hoax, one of the best books i have read about this case is the amityville horror conspiracy by Dr S Kaplan, it totally blasts the lutzes story to bits.

They kept changing the details to exaggerate it. They stayed in the house for 10 days but after a while they started lying and said that they'd stayed for 28 days. It was also clear by their behaviour that they only wanted some fame - they wouldn't let paranormal investigators in but the crews for popular TV shows were allowed.
FxAD44Moaa	sorry, once i was more confident and i flashed my former boss... i was arrested...    after i left the building that is.      this was after many, many years of a hierarchy of leadership that was past corrupt...   many put up and  were pillaged...    the lucky ones lost their jobs...  they were good folks.    i just got mad finally..    my age at the time..  32.    sex?   well i had alot of it back then.. with the same female.. i was married and still am..    i'm male by the way.    i'm not sure it was confidence but i'm certain it falls under that category of ability.|`|a7kHBY5eaa	I'm a 21 year old woman and let me tell you that I have a whole list of things I would do if I were more confident (that I only see myself doing in my imagination).

AyEkA6Flaa	The next time he calls you cutie, walk up to him with a smile, brush your hand across his chest, and ask him just how cute he thinks you are.    He may just laugh...but it is a suggestive move and will make him think.    And at some point, ask him if he would be offended if he had a gay or bi friend.  That isn't exactly coming out...but kinda...and again will get a valuable response from him.    If he turns out to be gay friendly, come out to him quietly when it's just the two of you.  Like, "We're good friends, right?  You would support me and be my friend no matter what, right?"  Of course he will agree.      Then say, "I hope this doesn't offend you, but there isnt' anyone I can talk to about this, and I trust you."  *look at him again.*  "Uh, I think there are some guys that I kinda like.  I wonder if I might be bisexual.  What do you think about that?"    If he is bi himself, he may come out to you then...or at some later point when he has thought about it.  But if you trust this guy, and he seems really nice, he would probably keep your confidence and would truly stand by you.|`|5poK95JFaa	leave the poor guy alone.|`|HmJOZbiYaa	ask him his opinion on homosexuality.|`|oDdXpghDaa	No word of a lie... give him a teddy bear and watch his reaction (or if you're still in the closet get a friend to give it to him).

c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	absolutely.    i'm very glad the anti catholic basher folks haven't come down upon you for the whole confirmation. usually you get the "that's not biblical".    God bless you in your faith!!!|`|LQQAQDkIaa	You are asking in the wrong place. You are validly baptized. If you want to be confirmed in another faith, you must speak to their church leaders. Confirmation usually requires study, and acceptance of the faith. You need to ask them. Pax Christi    I noticed another answer saying Catholics Lutherans and Methodists don't baptize correctly, because they baptize children. Odd that the poster named 3 of the oldest branches of Christianity. We have been baptizing children since the beginning. All the first Christians did, and still do.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Yes, you can change forms of Christianity, but this is not a decision to be taken lightly. You should take confirmation classes in Catholicism before you decide whether or not you wish to be confirmed Catholic. If after all the education, you decide Catholicism truly is not for you, then you should take confirmation classes in the Lutheran Church and see if that's right. If not, then you should take catechism classes with the Methodists (I don't believe all sorts of Methodists confirm, but if the church you pick doesn't, they at least ought to have catechism courses).|`|gmaCvh00aa	Yep.  Episcopalian is the closest to Catholic, and they accept the Catholic confirmation because it follows the apostolic succession also.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Try becoming Born Again instead.  (It sounds like you are just an agnostic to me.)|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Baptizing a baby is worthless and means nothing. It is not Biblical at all. You only get baptized after you have become Born Again and join a Church. Not a catholic one either. They do not follow the true Word of God from the KJV Bible.     Confirmation is also not Biblical. Those are doctrines that are not of God, but of the catholic church cult. I am a former catholic and am now a Born Again Christian.|`|8IHfytEvaa	Yes.    I would assume that you could take confirmation classes at most Lutheran and or Methodist churches and be confirmed there without being baptized again.    However that would not be Biblical.    Baptism in the Bible was always done to adults who wanted to be baptized and who had decided first to repent of their sins.  Babies can't repent or believe.    The word, "Baptism" comes from the Greek root word, "bapto" or "baptizo" and it means immerse or to plunge into water.  It does not mean sprinkle or pour unless you sprinkle enough water so that the subject becomes totally covered with water.    Even the Roman Catholic Catechism agrees with the definition above saying that it means "to plunge into water".    However Roman Catholics and Lutherans and most other mainline churches don't do that.    Let me suggest you take the Alpha Course which is taught at lots of different denominations of churches from Assembly of God to Episcopal to United Methodist.    http://www.alphausa.org/    This class is taught from 10 to 15 weeks, 2 1/2 hours per weekly class and is taught via DVD by an Anglican Priest from London who was a lawyer before he entered the ministry.    The weekly class starts with dinner, followed by some jokes, a 45 minute lecture via DVD followed by a small group discussion with 5 to 10 others such as yourself.    This class teaches what Christianity is about from the Biblical point of view without any denominational bias.    I took the class last fall and loved it.    I've taught the same material in Sunday School classes and Wednesday evening services at several different churches and college campuses over the years, but the guy who teaches this class has a gift of teaching which is amazing.    By the way, I was raised Lutheran and took the Alpha course last fall at a nearby United Methodist Church.    Currently I'm planting a new church in a college town in Florida.  The new church will be a non denominational church.|`|JqzCRh1paa	First,.... Baptism is a Christian sacrament, valid any where you go. I know most  Lutheran Churches  Have Conformation But that is primarily a Catholic faith tradition, Just remember this once a Catholic Always a Catholic...even if you attend a different sect of Christianity.    If you are one of those people who don't like the Catholic Faith because society says it's not right and you here all these bad thing ,    Just remember The catholic Church is the Oldest form of Christianity , for 2009 years it teaches the exact same doctrine .... all other forms of Christianity have only been around about 500 years...  there are over 38,000 different forms of Christianity ....all claiming that they are right & the catholic Church is wrong...   There is still Only one Catholic Church.. Unchanged...    By the Way It is the Catholic Church who Compiled the Bible from the many books written over the centuries by the prophets & Apostels.    The Lutheran Church and the Protestant reformation Removed some of the Books...so they could break away from the Catholic Church.      http://www.catholicscomehome.org/epic/ep...|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Sounds like you think picking your faith is like shopping for shoes.    Find your mom and ask her top slap some sense into you.|`|3WYcPsm4aa	As Nowhere man stated, your baptism will be recognized by any other Christian denomination.  You are not baptized Catholic, Lutheran, etc.  You are baptized as a child of God.    To those of you criticizing infant baptism, we believe that God chooses us, so this is our response to that.... giving over our children whom He has already chosen.  And, if you read in the bible, it states that "entire households" were baptized, not "entire households except children under the age of 10".  Lutherans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Anglicans, etc. all have confirmation.  It is there that you state that you have studied the doctrine and theology of your faith, and you want to confirm you life as a child of God and also as a member of that particular faith.  As these churches all have set doctrine, this is standard practice.  Only those faiths without set doctrine do not practice this.  It is NOT just a Catholic thing.  Trust me... been through it myself, and both daughters are in Lutheran confirmation classes.  Best advice... do your research, talk to the pastors, read their catechisms, and do some praying on this.      Blessings in your journey!|`|xZet9Dunaa	no|`|iNCzewKRaa	I would like to suggest to you that you stay away from taking any part of organized religion, most likely you will never find one that you agree with 100%.    I am a Agnostic and feel that if a GOD is real then organized religion is the worst thing to even happen to him !|`|isll2Uqnaa	baptism is an individuals PERSONAL decision to serve God..no one can make that decision for you, not your parents, friends, etc. your baptism technically doesnt count because you had nothing to do with it. there are atheists out there who were baptized as babies. read the Bible and when you're ready, get baptized. God sees your heart.|`|E71jweytaa	no other religion has a confirmation, we the catholics are the only ones that stand true to scripture|`|zMcHYQeBaa	I was baptized Catholic and confirmed and then baptized later at a non-denominational church. That was the one that really meant something to me and now I am just CHRISTIAN and student of God's Word, no denomination.     Why categorize yourself when you don't have to?|`|AA12257580	As long as the baptism is "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit," most Christian denominations will recognize it as valid.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	There is absolutely no medical condition that makes you "want to drink blood" - if a person does think they "want to drink blood" that is a psychological issue, and not triggered by any physiological response. There is a unique delusion where the victim wants to drink blood, aptly named Renfield syndrome, after the character in Dracula, but it is not a physiological need.    If you drink blood, it does not transfer into your blood system - it goes to the stomach where it is broken down chemically, and the iron in it is destroyed by the hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Humans cannot ingest iron in an unprotected state - iron pills are coated in order to allow them to enter the small intestine in a ball of chyme (semi-digested food matter), and be digested there away from the stomach acids. Blood would be broken down to water and the molecules that make up the blood cells and platelets. There is thus no way ingested blood can do anything for you except to provide water. There are little inherent nutrients in blood - and most of what is there is from the person eating a good meal, which is digested and the nutrients enter the bloodstream through the walls of the small intestine - proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Anyone who tells you they need to drink blood to survive or stay healthy is a delusional wannabee at best, or a lying psychotic at worst.    As for "psychic" vampires, there is absolutely no proof whatsoever of any way to "drain" energy from another human being. There is no evidence of chi, prana, blood energy, or any of that twiddle-twaddle. The body does generate a low-level electrical and electromagnetic field, but has no way to physically drain those fields from someone else. A person might claim they can do such , "feeding" off your emotions and so on and so forth, but it is a delusion.     Lastly, every single one of the self-professed "vampires" out there are 100% human, with average human physiology, no different than you, me, or Captain Kangaroo. If they go to the hospital for any reason needing bloodwork or DNA testing, they will be proven to be human, no anomalies, no glitches, no organs they don't need, etc. etc. etc. This need to be a "vampire" is a psychological delusion, and for anyone throwing a temper tantrum and screaming, "They do exist! They do exist!" - fine. Let's see some real proof, and not from these stupid vampire websites spewing their fictional trash. No, go to your doctor, have the aforementioned labwork done, and if he says, "Look, you're a vampire!" then scan those lab results along with his affadavit on stationery with his letterhead on it, and post them as a downloadable file so we can all see your proof. Will you do that for me?    I am a Nurse, with real medical education, training and knowledge.     I've had hate mail from these so-called "vampires", public attacks in the Y/A! forums, death threats, told to "shut up", told I don't know what I'm talking about, told I'll wake up "covered in blood", etc. etc. etc. ad nauseum. Every single one I've invited to come find me, and told them where and when. Guess they couldn't get out of remedial math class that morning. ROFLOL.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	no they are not real. some people are demented and so lured in by the romanticism of vampirism that they pursue this lifestyle. Vampires as we know it, the undead with fangs and all are not real.|`|yCTxg4t5aa	Depends on you Definition, if you going looking for a Edward Cullen or Count Dracula then no sorry they're just fiction. There are some though that have simply adopted the name because its the closest word that could be found in the english language. there are Sanguine and Psi "vampires" and people really need to get they're head around the whole Hollywood vampire thing, of course they don't exist and no legitimate Sang or Psi would ever pretend to be one.|`|AA11138696	No they are not real.  Vampires are a fictional creation They do not exist|`|GuBF5xhDaa	Not in the sense that you see in the movies. They are normal people who have a physical need for extra energy because they don't have enough of their own to stay healthy. Sanguines drink small amounts of blood from willing donors, and psychic vampires pull the energy directly from their donors. They are not mental, and they don't have medical conditions like Porphyria. The only reason they use the word "vampire" is because it is the closest word that fits their condition. They don't sleep in coffins, they aren't immortal, and the worst that they get from the sun is a burn.   http://www.sanguinarius.org/  http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/  http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/  http://vampirewebsite.net/   http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm|`|6X1hJeZYaa	I love Twilight but Every question I see is "Are Vampires real?"

They've been part of folklore for centuries, and Bram Stoker built them up in his original book (Dracula, incase you didn't know) from a prince, Vlad III (known as the impaler), to what we know as sedative bloodsuckers today.|`|9pmpr0Eyaa	http://www.sanguinarius.org/  http://www.drinkdeeplyanddream.com/  http://sphynxcatvp.nocturna.org/  http://vampirewebsite.net/   http://psychicvampire.org/index.htm    there aren't i so helpful? they are but not many people know/ believe kinda like god in the way that they are there but not all believe|`|uulQKYu7aa	Bearclaw's right - they do hate him. It must be hard for all the vampires to know they can't argue him down, and they can't provide the proof he asks for, and to know, deep inside, that he's right. Truth hurts, don't it?    It's like a book - everytime you open it with the intention of finding an answer, you get the same one every time, because it's the truth. Truth doesn't change to suit your fantasies, and Bearclaw has every right to post the truth, be it one time or a million. He's a Nurse - that does take intelligence, sunshine. Got his proof yet? No? Too bad.|`|0IKdojzeaa	This is actually entertaining to watch. So many humans fighting each other over their own evidence. To answer your question, yes they are...but to an extent as you said. No they DO NOT  sparkle or anything. They don't wear black capes and live in Transylvania. I know a few who are psi (most common really) ans they look human. It is sad though, i have more vampire friends than wolf friends. I have nothing against the vampires, it's just weird that I am where I am...wolf amongst a coven. Talk about out of place.|`|919XflnDaa	It's not a mystery. Vampires are real. But the majority wh claim to be are just fakes. All online covens are fake. A real Vampire group would be a part of a clan. As a birthright Vampire I can tell who the fakes are. Try not to be fooled by all the fashion vampires. What up and smell the reality. We Vampires are very real, if you choose to believe or not. And we aren't going anywhere anytime soon.|`|AA11769249	Ah, listen! The children of the night..what music they make!     Count Dracula, Lestat, Angel. Are they real? Sure, I don't doubt for one.     Do you believe they are? If yes, then they are as real as you and I. Same with werewolves.    There are people that drink blood and say they draw energy from it. Are they vampires? They believe so, and I have no reason to doubt them. Same with "energy" or psychic vampires. They say they feed off of people's psychic energy and gain energy from it themselves. Do they? Again, they believe they do and I'm not going to doubt.    I remember a quote from the 1931 movie, Dracula. In it, Van Helsing is talking about vampires in general and says "Remember..the vampires one true power is no one believe in him."     Keep an open mind, always look around the woods at night as you walk and if need be keep a wooden stake with you. ;-)

School /work with non-muslims....completely fine.  I can't imagine it being any different with going to school or working with muslims.      Extremely open-minded......although where i live.....its ultra-conservative and fairly close minded....i hate it.  I am fairly conservative, but its not really a choice here...you're expected to be that way.   Close mindedness sort of come with it....its the safer way.....need to keep doing things the way they have been done.    I prefer liberal areas because you are given the choice to be conservative if you want.  I'm an engineer too, so when i look at something, i always think, how can we make this better.      The only thing i don't like is charity.   Here when you give charity, you get your name printed in big letters in the newspaper or on some pamphlet......the muslims always donate anonymous, so our names never appear and then people think we don't do charity work.|`|WSTeoNItaa	I wish muslims would leave the USA|`|DUkXr1OCaa	i like the leaving part|`|xsDwZgroaa	Haha, I didn't even catch the "leaving" thing!    It's not too bad.  It can be hard to go to grocery stores with inappropriate magazines by the checkout, but a lot of the people are nice, and no body has caused me any harm, alhamdulillah.  And there's a good Muslim community around the mosque.|`|CwqW45Rmaa	I'm Muslim and I do indeed live in the U.S.A...that's because I was born and raised here. =D  I love the U.S.A, I just dislike the fact that people stereotype Muslims and say that we are all terrorists. When really, every religion has insane people who have lost their minds in one way or another. I dislike that all the bad spotlight is on Islam and how some Americans are so quick to judge Muslims.    Going to school with non- Muslims is perfectly fine. I know many cool non Muslim girls who I hang with and who are good people.   I am open minded... I don't care what other people choose to believe, because that's their deal. I believe that you shouldn't shun my religion, and I won't shun yours.|`|FRNgFcuhaa	As long as you conduct yourself strictly to the true Muslim way of life, do your bits to enhance the quality of life in your neighbourhood, be nice to others and not a busy-body you should be alright I suppose. Whether you're at school, the workplace or in your neighbourhood, it does not really matter. You will be judged on your actions and words, rather than your race or religious faith. Of course, as a true Muslim you should also observe all the Do's and Don't's in Islam based on the concept of "amal makruf, nahi mungkar!" We have to show to our non-Muslim friends and neighbours that the Muslim way of life is the best.

There was a large crowd that night, and the air from the vent caught my dress, sending it well above my butt, and everyone could see my underwear! the whole crowd was laughing.

It's a very fun language. Don't let your teacher limit you. It's not like you can only learn one language.    However, it will be difficult if you don't have someone to practice speaking with. The best thing to do when learning a new language is speaking with native speakers, and practicing speaking as often as you can otherwise you'll forget what you learned.    I took Spanish in high school, and Japanese and Mandarin in college. I'm not fluent, especially because I didn't have anyone to practice speaking with for any of those languages. so I lost a lot of it. But I have to say that Japanese actually isn't that difficult to learn, especially if you have a lot of interest in it. (However, I'm familiar with Asian languages, so that may have made things more understandable for me... plus I watched a lot of anime at the time and taught myself hiragana -- the first set of alphabet you learn in Japanese.)    Anyway, I say go for it and don't let your teacher hold you back.|`|3YdDpReTaa	Learn it, it is a wonderful language that will prove to be very useful in the future.  Japan is a rising economic power, so if you plan on doing any sort of formal business with them in a career, it is a huge plus.  Also, you won't need subtitles for anime, which will let you enjoy the shows in all their purest, most original form.  Not to mention speaking to japanese friends.    The language is a bit difficult at first, but after you get the grammar down and the writing, its not all that hard anymore.  If you put effort into it, it will prove to be a very fun and worthwhile language to learn.    Your teacher is wrong, learn it.

You are one of the best people i have ever met. and im am so happy you are in my life. ever sense i met you i've been truly happy. Thank you for being there for me.    Some thing like that..   Sorry if its not what you are looking for..  Im sure he will happy to hear what ever is in your heart to tell him. As long as its true and coming from you..    Good luck [[=|`|f1SWISQYaa	you dont have to say anything, get naked on the bad when he comes in, you know what to do

aeZUNltFaa	okay here what I would do:  you get/ make a nice cute little card with a bee on it that says "will you bee my valentine?" and maybe one rose/ flower if u have 1. then when shes about to leave, give them to her   be sure to let her know its okay if she does not wish to be your valentine. girls like being able to truly tell someone how they feel but find it hard when the guy is sweet and they dont want to hurt him|`|uB0QueSOaa	JUST ASK HER THE WORST THING THAT CAN POSSIBLE HAPPEN IS THAT SHE'LL SAY NO BUT ASK WITH ENOUGH TIME TO ASK SOMEONE ELSE IF ANYTHING FAILS...GOOD LUCK|`|0Cpqulbraa	yeh, chances are you just think shes hott and cant stop imajining doing her so how bout keep thinking of that but save yourself the humiliation of asking her out (unless of course she has made some clear signes she likes you)|`|64whpLcvaa	Its no big deal if she's a year older or if she's your friends sister. If you like her and she likes you back, your in the bag. Even if it turns out she doesn't like you, she'll think its pretty sweet that you asked her on valentines, because who wouldn't! If your really nervous, take a deep breath and practice what you're going to say and do. If you have confidence, she'll totally appreciate it! If you think you're gonna be too nervous and don't want to do it, you still should. Its worth knowing how she feels about you and taking risks is all apart of life. just think if you didn't ask her and although she liked you, and you missed out! You don't want that to happen, so go ahead with it.|`|affbe5008ef24169fc91cd83c735213eaa	You should show some courage and go ahead and approach her and be positive cause wat ever happens happens for good...|`|yegDdZfRaa	1. Just do it...everyone is nervous - if you're not good with words, think about/write down what you want to say to her and rehearse it.    2. 1 year isn't a big deal.    3. DO NOT tell your friend yet if he/she doesn't already know.    4. Refer back to  1.    Call her on the phone & ask her if she wants to have dinner with you prior to VDay. Buy her a flower and treat her to dinner & a movie. If she says yes, then it's a start...if she says no - it wasn't meant to be.    Don't mention this to your friend in case it doesn't work out. If she says yes, then casually mention it. Sometimes friends can sabotage a potential relationship without realizing it...especially when it's their sibling.|`|4pwMzFaQaa	Dude just man up and do it bro. ask her|`|jMGN4KU5aa	So, don't ask her in person. Write her a sweet little note or something. That's how I'm asking mine. If you're really creative, make the note a poem or a really nice card or something. Something so sweet she can't say "no". Good luck! ?|`|a1x1tLqtaa	Write her a poem like this:    Whenever I think of you  It makes me feel a connection  And I know it's true  About this certain affection    Your name is my hearts treason  It wont go away  But for some reason  I hope it will stay    You are the up-most perfection  And your beauty is beyond belief  So I ask you a question  Hoping your answer brings relief    If you would do one thing  In which I only hope you agree  Will you make my soul sing  And go out with me?      I did not write this, but I hopes it helps!
CCAQWT25aa	Anlisis de datos  Las formas de onda de presin y volumen en el dominio del tiempo para cada individuo fueron  promediadas en conjunto (con periodicidad normalizada a 1 segundo graduando el eje de tiempo). Las FTI que relacionaban la Prad con la forma de onda del VPD y la forma de onda de la Pdig con la forma de onda del VPD en el dominio de la frecuencia fueron determinadas a partir de la transformada de Fourier (FTF) de las formas de onda para cada individuo: FTI (Prad/VPD)=FTF(Prad)/FTF(VPD) y FTI(Pdig/VPD)=FTF(Pdig)/FTF(VPD). Para este anlisis se usaron las primeras 10 armnicas de cada forma de onda porque armnicas ms altas no contribuyen significativamente.   Se determinaron FTIs en la lnea de base y 3 minutos despus de la administracin de NTG (cuando los cambios debidos a la NTG eran mximos) mediante el uso de un mnimo de 6 ciclos estables consecutivos obtenidos de los 3 transductores. GTFs para las formas de onda en reposo y 3 minutos despus de la administracin de NTG se derivaron promediando las FTIs en la lnea de base y luego de la administracin de NTG.      I'll post my translation only once! lol    Good luck.      C.
CCAQWT25aa	Protocolo  Los sujetos descansaron en posicin supina en un laboratorio con temperatura controlada (261o C) por 30 minutos. Formas de onda simultneas de presin y volumen fueron registradas durante 30 segundos a intervalos de 5 minutos durante 15 minutos. Luego, se administr NTG (500 g) sublingual a un subgrupo de 20 de los sujetos normotensos, y se obtuvieron nuevos registros simultneos de presin y volumen 3 minutos despus de la administracin de NTG, cuando estaba en el momento de su mayor efecto.      Good luck.      C.
CCAQWT25aa	Registro de la presin y el volumen de pulso  El volumen digital fotopletismogrfico fue determinado mediante el uso de un diodo que emita luz infraroja (940 mm) y un fototransistor (Micro Medical) aplicado a cada lado del dedo ndice de la mano derecha. Se us tonometra plana para registrar el Prad por medio de un transductor de tensin (Millar SPT 301, Millar Instruments) aplicado sobre la arteria radial del brazo izquierdo. Pdig se midi en forma no invasiva mediante el uso de un anillo de presin servocontrolado (Finapres 2300, Ohmeda) aplicado al dedo medio de la mano derecha. Estudios previos han mostrado que los cambios en la presin medida por el tonmetro y Finapres reflejan con exactitud los cambios en la presin intra-arterial. Las se?ales de todos los transductores fueron amplificadas, expuestas en tiempo real, digitadas y registradas via un convertidor de anlogo a digital de 12 bits (frecuencia en el muestreo 100 Hz). Ulterior procesamiento de las se?ales digitales fue realizado offline. La presin de la arteria braquial (brazo izquierdo) se midi con un mtodo oscilomtrico automatizado (Dinamap, Critikon). Ya que el peopsito del presente estudio era comparar la morfologa de las formas de onda, todas las formas de onda se normalizaron a la misma amplitud (nominalmente igual a la presin del pulso de la arteria braquial).      I hope it helps.      C.

w7Ej7KFhaa	The first time I kissed a girl. It made me feel all innocent like a little kid. I think I blushed a little bit and everything, everything was clear. It made me feel really alive. We had broken into a closed park in the middle of winter and were completely alone. It was really romantic.    The worst experience was the first time I had lesbian sex. Not because the sex was bad or I was disgusted, but because I had NO idea what I was doing and was incredibly self-conscious.|`|I0xO8IAHaa	my first kiss with my gf|`|w9cYBmiVaa	either some makeout sessions i've only had in my dreams or past expieriences playing house :)|`|vzQBmR4Paa	mine was my first time with my older cousin Lacey. it was at her pool during the summer an was my first time skinny dippin.|`|HmJOZbiYaa	i made-out with my girlfriend in the school closet.|`|XhdqONLCaa	probably my very first girl-girl kiss in middle school. it was in the restroom at school ;)
tI1NHwfBaa	Several points to make about your question.      First, "safe sex" is a misnomer.  Condom companies used to advertise condoms with this phrase, but they had to stop.  People still got pregnant, they still caught STD's, and they sued. "Safe" suggests freedom from risk, and when you are using a condom you are reducing risk, not eliminating it.  Next condom ad you see, notice that they probably use the term "safer sex," but not "safe sex."  Some diseases (gonorrhea is a good example) are very infectious, and a condom, used properly, only reduces the chance of infection by 50%.  According to the CDC, one in four sexually active teenage girls has a sexually transmitted disease.  That's huge!    Second, condom use is sporadic at best.  Even for those who know how to use them, studies indicate that they often don't use them, or they use them improperly.  One study of couples where one partner was infected with HIV and the other was not indicated that even these couples used condoms correctly less than half the time.    Third, even if you could prevent all unwanted teen pregnancies and diseases, this doesn't mean that teen sex is acceptable.  Studies show that sexually active girls are much more likely to experience depression and other psychological problems.    Fourth, abstinence education absolutely works.  Study after study shows that it delays the onset of sexual activity among teenage girls.  In the state of Georgia in 1994, teen pregnancies and STDs were at an all-time high.  When the state mandated abstinence education, those rates dropped dramatically.    Fifth, studies show that when abstinence education is combined with explicit instructions on birth-control and condom use (called abstinence-plus), neither curriculum is effective.  Students take the instruction on condom use as the "wink wink" that says the abstinence message isn't a serious one.  Combining these programs seems to hurt the success rate of both of them.    The problem that opponents of abstinence education have is that they believe if it's not 100% effective, it's useless.  This is an illogical position to take.  Abstinence education is more effective than condom use, it reduces problems that condoms don't, and it is an uplifting, empowering message.  It is not a religious message.  It is a frank discussion of the differences between young men and young women, how our choices affect us, what sexually transmitted diseases are and what the risks are, etc.  It's honest, open discussion that doesn't preach -- it just gives kids good information.    Anyone that suggests that kids shouldn't have this type of information is promoting ignorance.  I can't believe how many supposedly "enlightened" or intelligent people reject abstinence education out of hand because they think it's an attempt to preach.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	There is no point to it and its border line lying to students. The whole argument for it is 'if kids don't know about sex they won't do it' or 'if they think the ONLY way to stay safe is not to do it, they won't,' which totally ignores raging hormones and the fact that teenagers (no offense) are stupid.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	I agree with this!  They think keeping kids stupid will solve the problems of STDs and unwanted pregnancies when its just contributed to it.    We have natural urges. Even if one has never heard about sex they would eventually have it (watch blue lagoon!)    If we teach abstinence as an option that's fine but we should tell them how to be safe if they DON'T choose that path.|`|AA11987172	Ask Sarah Palin's daughter...|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	It works just as well as the "just don't shoot anybody" method of gun safety.|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Abstinence, like most everything else christians preach, is all about control though guilt and fear.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	It's all just stupid people who really think that keeping information away will prevent anything from happening. But that's easier with other areas of life that don't come with hormones to tempt them otherwise.    Tell them all the details and tell them what is expected of them. Tell them nothing and they are bound to be curious of this secret and try to find out for themselves...and end up in a predicament.|`|kFpFU97zaa	It's a dangerous ideal, much akin to plugging one's ears and closing one's eyes in the hopes it will go away.    You can have abstinence only sex education, but it should always be paired with the resources needed for safe sexual practices. Bible Belt teens have proved that they will do it, regardless. The best one can do is at least make sure that they're not woefully ignorant about it.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	Those who try to pass those laws just plug their ears and go lalalalalalala!|`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	100% certainty of not getting pregnant or an STD or AIDS.  it's also has to do with morals and having them.|`|GVcO1dtnaa	True. Blame the church. There the ones who preach and push abstinence. It's been proven it fails but they still ignorantly keep teaching it.|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	we had sex education in my high school and more than half of the girls were still getting pregnant.    both sex education and abstinence class don't work., if they did. the STD rate and pregnancy rates would be a lot lower than what they are now.    education starts from the home. no need to blame the church...blame the parents.|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	The point is I guess they think that if the kids no how to prevent pregnancy and stds and still have sex they will have sex.  Fact is the kids that are going to have sex are going to have sex and the kids that are going to wait are going to wait.  The schools need to teach safe sex practices and get permission from the parents for the kids to participate in the program.  In the end, it is the parents responsibility to teach the children about sex and too many parents are not taking that responsibility seriously.  I want my daughter to wait until marriage and I have told her on several occasions but I have also taught her that if she just can not control herself and feels she absolutely must have sex before than to come to me and we will buy her some condoms and that she is to use them every single time without fail or she very likely will wind up pregnant or with an std.  I have let her have every educational opportunity at her school, which thankfully does teach abstinance is best but also goes over condomes etc.  As morally correct as abstance till marriage is unfortunately in todays sociaty kids will do what they will do and they should be prepaired for it.|`|2rJwgk40aa	There is no point,and its crazy.Teens are going to have sex if they want to.You HAVE to teach them about how to prevent diseases& pregnancy  so they can make intelligent choices.you cant ignore the problem and hope it goes away.|`|otEpwY5eaa	Amen to that!

I mean sex is part of life, what is the point in not telling kids about it.|`|AA12383652	Most people want the facts taught but with an emphasis on abstinence and not doing the wink wink when it comes to teaching sex that makes it seem like teens are mature enough to handle a sexual relationship.    My problem is with the schools providing birth control and the attitude that its no big deal if you have sex.      Teach the facts and the technicalities.  Leave the morality to the parents and the responsibility of getting birth control to the people that claim they are mature and responsible enough to be having sex.|`|SDBkcMP9aa	Watch the episode "Proper Condom Use" of South Park, it pretty much explains why abstinence only sex ed is so common. It's very awkward for some people to sit down and explain to their children what sex is, and how a "babby is formed."|`|nHgk09tAaa	paranoia and to over populate for the proses of  war to protect freedom from aliens (you know, from outer space).|`|HJEQv3cBaa	God puts issues such as this in his word for a reason you touched on the main reason why abstinence is great before marriage because of teen pregnancy which puts a huge burden on any teen mother/father and this is one of the reasons why there are many broken homes in the world today. Another good reason to stay abstinent might sound cliche but you want it to be special for your husband/wife when people have sex before marriage it has a tendency to cloud their judgment causing them to make bad decisions (not using a condom because he/she loves me) or they can have it so much they become numb to the feeling and in this case it can cause you to think your husband or wife is the same as anybody else you have been with(not saying it always happens but it happens) People also get Married just based on HOW GOOD SOMEONE IS IN BED you do not want to make a decision like this. There is sooooooo much more to marriage. With all that being said there is no need for any child to be ignorant of sex ed because it is the PARENTS responsibility to teach them about what they need to know not the schools. Always remember even safe sex isn't safe sex (condom can break, birth control doesn't ALWAYS work) the safest way is abstinence. hope that helped.|`|0FXVTZf7aa	Proponents have a huge misunderstanding about Sexual Purity in the Bible.  To them what 'works' is only what some preacher tells them will and will not work.  They put way too much trust in to their preachers and English Bible translations.

TMb076n6aa	I am not a student but a tutor in the schools.    If you know who you are in Christ you dont have to fear rejection because Jesus bore your shame.     You are his beloved and His Bride and are royalty.     The righteous (Christians) are as bold as a lion.Prov 28:1     and shall never be out to shame. Joel 2:26,27    God will put to shame those who hate us Psalm 44:7    Also in my experience God has done a wonderful Job at humiliating those who rejected me and hated me.     Examples:     The woman fired for comming against me for no reason at work when I tried to be a friend to her and everyone else made fun of her.    The manager (demoted) 2 times to be a store clerk because he would not take up for me.    Another manager sexually harrased me and then eventually  fired and nearly killed in a car accident.     Note: I DID NOT wish evil and do not hate on these people I just put them in God's hands and prayed for them.      I feel for sorry those who mess with his Bride no I am not gloating.     hope this helps!|`|WX1b747Iaa	I'm betting biology class can be stressful, since evolution underpins every facet of it.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	I'm not a christian.

Issues like homosexuality and evolution are things that can't be in an open discussion in the classroom, and that puts the kids at a disadvantage because they won't get both sides of the argument, they'll only hear the Church's opinions. The Church tries to censor some subjects and so Christian school teachers, such as my dad, can't have debates or discussions about issues that the Church has their opposition to.

Time is running out for us all as soon as we are born.  That's what makes life precious. You should expect to die a million other ways before succumbing to the rapture. If you'ree right with God then what do you have to worry about anyway?  You have no idea how God will react to the sin's of others.   You are a sinner yourself, just like everyone else.

Philosopher Bertrand Russell had a great analogy as to why people still believe in god   "If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is an intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time."  God is the same concept. Drilled into our heads from birth, trying to jam round pegs into square holes|`|AABCy5mQaa	Everyone has free wil. The right to choose.

I personally am not a Christian, but I embrace all others beliefs and opinions, wether I agree or not. And yes I do belief in God.

w8uUWK03aa	Snake... do your parents even know you are gay?  I'm assuming not, so telling them that you are gay and you like older men would be a double shock.      The first thing they are going to presume is that you have been sexually molested my an older man and that you are not gay as such, just a victim, for which they will want revenge.  I would not advise being quite so forthcoming with them.      Announcing your gay should be enough to keep you going for a while.  Once they are used to that, then maybe introduce them to a partner, but to be perfectly honest with you, I can't ever see you all playing happy families.  I'm sorry to be so negative.      Incidentally, I'm an "older" man or a young-at-heart mature man, as I prefer, but I think I'd be uneasy being introduced to the parents of my 20 year old lover - if only I had one, that is  :(       Good luck!|`|dBdQB4KHaa	OK im going to tell you the same thing i told the other guy.You will cause friction no mater how you say it and they will be hurt.

Personally, my parents have a 12 year difference between them and they get along fine.

5HcnqxKQaa	Without the actual Chinese characters or the tones, I doubt anyone can tell you the meaning of your name. :-/    There are four tones, but each tone already has a ton of different characters. For example, Wei can be  or  or , or even  if you're female.    The other answerer presumed that Weilur is your entire Chinese name. I'm guessing that Weilur does not include your last name at all. If that's true, it invalidates the other answer as  is primarily used as a last name.

sunEk8NVaa	Dates when the world was supposed to end:    1000 AD- Jesus Christ was supposed to return and the the things written in Revelations were supposed to take place    2000 AD- The Y2K bug was supposed to bring man back to the stone age    2006 AD- World War III was supposed to take place    2012 AD- The Mayan calendar ends thus "the end of the world".    None of the first three happened so why would the fourth one happen??? There was no scientific proof for the first three and there's none for the fourth. Science says the world will end after MILLIONS (or was it billions???) of years because the sun will expand too much, heating up the planet. Then it will slowly die off...

I shall probably state opinions which will get me thumbs down, but I don't care.      Since I care about the craft of writing fiction, which I don't do, the "originality" of J. K. Rowling's books is unimportant to me.  In fact I see the lack of "originality" in the background as one of their strengths.  Her world is, pretty much undigested, a variety of legends about witches wizards and magic.  Nicholas Flaumel and the Philosopher's Stone come out of an Aristocratic "occultist" tradition while broomsticks, horcruxes and in fact wizarding schools like Hogwarts are stories poor people used to tell by their fires.  While Alan Garner is as erudite and is scholarly as well (Rowling is the former but not the latter) there is really no reason why an adventure story should be scholarly and judicious in its choice of legends to depict.  Diana Wynn Jones and Mercedes Lackey come out of the same tradition of Speculative Fiction and Fantasy, and do a lot of speculating in their books, but Rowling reminds you of just what is so great about a cracking good adventure story.    Something else Rowling doesn't do is try to extend the language.  Boy magic-users are wizards and girls are witches.  They all go to wizarding school but the labels are consistently applied.  This is in line with the traditional usage of the words.  Further, broom flying is traditionally more closely associated with witches than with wizards, that is women than men.    And that leads me to the thing which is so disturbing about your question.  It uses a very Rowling-like image of magic-users, but identifies you with the male word.  Why?  In Wicca and other forms of the Pagan religion there are men who identify themselves as Witches, and Wicca is influenced by Feminism where people do ask themselves, what makes the male word better?     I don't have a simple answer to your question but even if your statements are true, I can't believe you.  Sorry.|`|AA12384132	Males are called wizards and females are called witches..........|`|hiGAR1Kmaa	Poor girl|`|ff545BLyaa	So whats the question?

HMMmmmm|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Let's discuss subjective reality vs. objective reality. An elderly patient with Alzheimers may believe with all his might that he is Superman, and can fly, and that is his subjective reality - we address him as "Mr. Kent" or "Clark" because to do otherwise would set off "I'll prove it to you" behaviors, such as climbing on his bed and trying to fly, which would result in broken bones, and maybe death. That part is objective reality.  A "wizard" may "cast a spell" to bring him more wealth, a new lover, get rid of an enemy, and so on and so forth, and when events seem to line up with his desired outcome he gives the "spell" the credit, when in all likelihood it would have happened anyway. That is subjective reality. A "wizard" that climbs to his roof, "casts a spell" and jumps off, is now dealing with objective reality, and falls, likely to his death.  If subjective reality could affect objective reality, then that would be real magic, and people would be flying around tossing fireballs, polymorphing people into cats, animating objects, teleporting using dimensional doorways, storing goods in portable holes, etc. etc. ad nauseum.    I for one, think you are making a weak attempt at yanking everyone's chain, so to speak, but if you truly believe this then it is my recommendation to either A. see your doctor and explain your situation so he can help you, or B. start taking your antihallucinagenics again.|`|XMzicF0Xaa	Kinda :DD
btLIW5xhaa	if somebody thinks about murder, does that make them a murderer? I know thats kid of a stretch, but it still sort of has a point. In our society, that person would not be a murderer. In Christianity, God knows his thoughts.    Christians believe that you must refrain from any homosexual impulses or thoughts. God sees everything, so its not just the actions.           peace|`|IKyITYICaa	Supposedly, in Christianity being gay is not a sin.  It is the act that is a sin.  Therefore, you can have 'gay' feelings so long as you don't act on them.  But this seems to be contradicted in the Bible by a passage that says (I'm paraphrasing here), "If you think about committing a sin, it's the same as committing the sin."  So in that case, even thinking about it dooms you.  But then again, if you accept Jesus Christ, you are forgiven so I guess overall it doesn't really matter.  Also strangely enough, many animals exhibit homosexual behavior.  For example, studies show that 10% of all rams commit strictly homosexual acts.  That begs the question, are they sinning against God and how is that possible if God made them and therefore made them that way???|`|UspK4SQBaa	Christianity doesn't define homosexuality, but you would generally be considered gay if you are only attracted to males.  Being attracted to males is not a sin, but if you lied to a woman and married her, that would be a sin.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	I you're attracted to men, then you are gay. Nothing to be ashamed about, though.|`|WF085j2Daa	no the followers of the goat herders have that one covered too, thought, word or deed|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Last I heard, Haggard is still going to heaven. So, hypocrisy is not a sin, and neither is homosexuality if a loud-mouthed bible thumper is the one doing it. Homosexuality is only a sin for those who feel it a sin to think for oneself and not do what magical invisible fairies somehow demand of them.|`|JIATcwW6aa	Being gay and being Christian are two different things.  They may co-exist.  I don't know that lust or attraction to someone else, regardless of sexual orientation, is a sin if you don't act upon it.  If you're married, acting upon it would be considered a sin of adultery.|`|lh2hEzoMaa	Yes, in logic an by deffiniton to.    But no i do not see it as a sin|`|Fpi8im9taa	Oh great, here comes the whole "homosexuality is a verb, not a noun, like gays ALWAYS think" that some Christians give.    The way I see it, the gender you're sexually attracted to determines your orientation. A homosexual will *feel* for the same sex, but may end up having kids, i.e., not with the gender they prefer. BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM STRAIGHT.|`|gHSarVD1aa	As far as I know you can be madly in love with whoever you want to. It's the physical breeding and lust that are the problem.|`|MMF1YmZZaa	I DON'T THINK IT IS A SIN TO BE GAY.    But, from a Christians point of view yes because there is a passage in the Bible (somebody help me out here with the revelation) that says all your inner thoughts that whisper in your head will be shouted from the rooftops.    Basically, I take this to mean that God knows every thought in your head, even if you never utter the words.|`|uz9GtV9vaa	If you're attracted to someone of the same gender, you're gay.  It's not considered a sin unless you have sex with someone of the same gender.|`|GVcO1dtnaa	Yes your still gay and by definition you still would go to hell cause at heart your attracted to men. but hell doesn''t exist so your in the clear.|`|ce26AOVzaa	I think grace will save you.

So don't worry about it and live your life as best as you can cuz it's all a load of rubbish!|`|zYAQrnjcaa	No, I don't think so.|`|Tq9KJ75paa	You might have homosexual tendencies but if you control it and treat it like any other sin, and move toward a biblical approach to relationships (marriage, kids, etc.) then no, you are not gay.|`|5ErnEt9baa	you may have homosexual tendancies, but it only becomes sin if you act on those tendancies, its just like alcoholics, my family has a bloody history of alcoholics and i have alcoholic tendancies, so i don't drink. but this does not mean that Jesus hates you.

okTecGZfaa	I'm not Asian, but I have a last name that people usually mangle if they just look at it and try to pronounce it. Personally, I've never been offended when someone asks me to help them out with the pronunciation.     I really think most people would rather have the chance to give you the correct pronunciation instead of having to listen to you struggle and then correct you. However, there are always be one or two sourpusses who will become irritable when you ask them.|`|4m3z1ztEaa	i am asian  no  just don't laugh when their names sound ridiculous in some way  and don't say it unless you can say it precisely  like the chinese language have four syllables   if you did not say the right syllable, it is another word  like the second syllable apply to SHI is a last name  if you said the third one instead, it means poo  that is the only part that you need to be careful with|`|DUkXr1OCaa	no, why the hell would that be offensive?  what the hell has happened to the world?|`|Iot2A1YRaa	I think people can appreciate when you try to pronounce their names the way is supposed to. if you then cant pronounce the name they would be nice and say "or you can just call me** so and so" and then dont feel bad that you tried.
jIk2ttH1aa	Wait, re edit.    I just read the word "crush" not "love" about how you feel about her.  So I wouldn't go for it.  You don't want to break them up and then find out that you aren't that into her all for nothing.    Besides - other people can't tell you about how THEY feel, nor can anyone predict exactly when or if it will last for THEM.    The only thing you could do is tell her how you feel I have a crush on you....or move on.  Simple as that.  Otherwise your spinning your wheels just wondering and guessing.|`|0JDYgUWKaa	Hey! Your best bet is to probably just wait it out and let her know that your there for her.

Good Luck!

It's simply a decision that you make, a promise to yourself.    A ring or a bracelet or a pledge card or something can help serve as a reminder and a public statement of your choice, but they're not necessary.    Congratulations on your decision.  I think it's a good one.|`|IbtQ5IKNaa	Ask forgiveness or cut it off.|`|b4Y0gDaIaa	just refrain from sex    O.o|`|0Ad0SrEfaa	It's really easy.

There's no office or overseers of your sexual activities. If you want to be abstinent, do so. You don't need a ring or anything else.|`|ev3EwV2laa	do you know the definition of abstinent? In order to be abstinent all you need to do is refrain from sexual activity.|`|jdKOejikaa	wack it off with a axe|`|Nu6HaIfgaa	I think a contract or ring is cool, because it visually makes you aware and others aware of your stance, but I don't think it's necessary.    Abstinence is about you respecting your body and making a sometimes hard but great choice for yourself. And if anyone leaves a rude comment ignore them. Abstinence is beautiful and very little people have the self control or self esteem to practice it these days.     And it's your body and your choice. So be as creative as you want. How do YOU want to show the promise to yourself and body. Maybe you can inspire others to do the same too.     Best wishes with everything|`|5ErnEt9baa	you are abstinent once you make the decision. thats all. but being abstinent entails actually following through with refraining from not only sex, but also masturbation, and etc. the point is to clear the mind of habitual debilitating sexual thoughts, to help us further our personal relationship with Jesus.  God Bless|`|QrUosz51aa	It's something between you and the Lord.  The ring is a reminder of staying pure before marriage. Kind of like a promise ring.  Staying true to the one you love.|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Hmmm  you could sign a pledge to yourself that you won't do it in any way or form until such and such date.  Then seal it, write that date on the front, and hide it until that date arrives.  Umm, ring?  Sure.  Try getting an engagement ring or an irish heart ring so nobody bothers you or tries to date you.  And are you talking about doing the deed or drinking?  Either way, there's an anonymous addicts program for that too!    Or just tell you parents that you are having sex and they'll never let you forget and humiliate you every day of your short little life until you finally leave the house.  Or let your gossipy classmates in high school know and they do that job for you and you'll just want to crawl in a hole until you get out.  Wait, that's just me.|`|1wJeITvdaa	There are really no instructions necessary for becoming celibate.  Celibacy is primarily a mental response. We can choose to be celibate, as we can choose to be sexual -- it is a personal choice that you make and stick to.     Thus celibacy is not to be thought of as mere abstinence from sex, but it is more accurately understood as a conscious choice made on behalf of one's greater personal gain. What we think determines what we do -- what we have thought determines what we have done. So if you are going to be celibate, you have to instruct the mind to take a mental attitude of celibacy.      . .|`|b7ae34ab971653d02308ce805affb7baaa	Do you know that Abstinent mostly refers to not drinking alcohol!?!   You can Abstain from anything pretty much but I assume you are talking about sex. Ask yourself WHY you want to do this and if so DO IT- Don't go around showing off to everyone about it as you will seem self righteous. Just don't have sex if you don't want to. To make it "official" is just a form of bragging and that is a sin of pride.|`|KhJwOurLaa	Abstain and leave the vows for those who want to make a hypocritical show of it.

6NEPcZFfaa	O_o I saw that movie yesterday, or at least the end of it, I was hoping he wouldn't jump and I was SO sad when he did. I'm not gay or a lesbian and I've never had to come out to anyone, so I don't know any real good advice and I don't know how your family is, maybe you should bring your friends over and have everyone sit around as you tell your family, OR just show them the movie so they can get a better understanding of who you are. but i dunno, you should probably listen to someone who really has been there. remember if all else fails out here in SoCal, we have a place called West Hollywood and I hear its the spot for gay people.|`|FqiA5BRraa	You should watch the movie with them and ask" would you treat any of your children like that?" if they don't respond or day no. wait till your older. Lots of kids end up on the street. or if they say that gay is bad and such i advice you not too tell them, remember that parents sometimes don't accept it at first but then they will.    Well my parents are very open minded people, even though they are religious(somewhat in the sense that they go to church,praise god and ect). They asked me if i were gay and i told them, they love me and we have a very good relationship.|`|YdwHmohPaa	Your life will be hell when u do be prepared :)|`|dBdQB4KHaa	You will cause frixshin no mater how you say it and they will be hurt. How you chooose to do it is your choice.Ither way they get hurt.|`|zVwbYjuoaa	I can't advise - I don't know your family.  My coming out was a total disaster. My parents opened some mail to me, and things got ugly. However, that was 1982 and I was 18 years old. I would say find some support people first who can help you through this, because a Christian family will not just accept and go on. The reason: ultimately, they think the desire is rooted in sin, and Jesus can "fix" you. The irony is that Jesus, if you are a Christian, came to die for all sin, past present and future. I personally don't think homosexuality is a sin in itself. I think God made us to all be different, and we are just a variation of humanity. However, there are still things that we can do, act in malice or do harm to our bodies, which I think are a sin.  Regardless, it never gets easier, and if I think if you can, perhaps wait until you are of age, because, if the going gets impossible, at least you can seek refuge elsewhere.|`|eDEX8TUVaa	Write them a letter and really really explain to them wat u feel n how thats wat makes u happy. this will make sure they cant interupt u if u were speaking. tell them u cant and arent gonna change who u are because its apart of u. be strong... dont give them any room 4 the "its just a phase" stuff, make sure they kno this is U. tell them u love them and always  will and that u need them. u need there support.    im strait but i have a very close friend that is gay. the told his parents and it was not pretty. but i also have family n friends who parents remained to support them.     b brave, do wat makes U happy and it will b fine. good luck and blessings sweetie^_^|`|pC1rRb9Oaa	stare at your dad until you get a hard, that'll show em!|`|otiBw8WYaa	I also watched the movie Prayers for Bobby. It was very touching. I am a 22 year old lesbian and I just told my parents the beginning of this year that I am a lesbian. I just got tired of the stress of trying to keep it a secret. I got to a point where I was like I'm not ashamed of who I am, in fact I love who I am and love my family so I just went over to visit one day and I asked my mother & father can I talk to them alone. We went to their room and I closed the door and I took a deep breath and let the rest pour from my heart. I figured hey its a new year why not a new leaf. They had a lot of questions and I answered them all. My mother expressed to me that she didn't like the fact of me waiting so long to tell her, she thought we were closer than that to keep secrets. Long story short, she told me she don't agree with it but its my life and they appreciated me telling them.|`|u5KrsHY3aa	DANN, DOOD, iDK, WHAT To SAY,  iM Bi, BuT MY MoM THiNK iM 100% GAY,  & APPeARANTLY SHeS oK WiTH iT, BuT SHE DoESNT KNo THT i KNo THAT SHE KNoWS THT iM HoMo,  BT iM NT TELLiNG MY DaD, CAuSE HELL BE ReALY DISAPOiNTeD BECAuSE iM THe oNLY BoY iN THe FAMiLY, So YeA,,,,|`|szIR4ahcaa	I would recommend simply telling your parents that you are gay (take it slowly). Try to keep them cooled down by giving them facts such as you didn't choose it, God gave it to you, God meant for it to be this way.    It will take a while for your family to adjust (one night to a few weeks) but they realize how much they love you and can't risk disowning you, etc. because of your unwanted sexual orientation.    Do some coaxing such as "Mom, I flt a need to tell you that. i wanted to be honest with you, because, I LOVE YOU, and I though t you would love me as well/ [perhaps I was wrong]."    It might help to show them this page right here to show them what you went through to come out. Anyways, it's much easier said than done, and I sympathize sincerely for the journey you will soon commence, but it will all work out. I PROMISE, very soon....    End the conversation softly with "I love you"
d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Sin is sin, but the only unforgivable sin is that of not wanting to be forgiven.    All sin is punished by death, but God sent His only Son to die to pay that price for us.  Accept His gift of salvation, and the price has been paid for you.      Have a blessed day.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Well if there was, such thing as God, which I seriously doubt. I would be bound to hell if this was the case and quite frankly it was all well worth it.    Also, that is the stupidest concept I ever heard because not that I am one of them.

Persisting in any sin is especially offensive to God.   If you have had sex and you are not married, don't do it again. Confess and make a genuine commitment to refrain from sin in the future.

The Greek word POR-NEI'A translated fornication refers to sexual intercourse between unmarried persons.    So then Eph 5:5 says:- no fornicator or unclean person or greedy person, which means being an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.     On the matter of sin the Bible says:-    1 John 3:4,8:- Everyone who practises sin is also practising lawlessness, and so sin is lawlessness. He who carries on sin, originates with the Devil. There is no small sin so thats OK or bigger sin so thats bad, sin is a falling short of the mark in God,s eyes.    However God gave his only begotten son Jesus as a ransom, so all who exercises faith, repent of sinful ways can be forgiven and go on to inherit the kingdom.

Good luck and I hope you get that diploma!|`|F3nlVXJ5aa	right now is a tough time to get a job because so many people are out of work but contact Vocational Rehabilitation (find it in your area, it's in the white pages of your phone book in the front under Federal Government) and apply, go to a session and then they will see you on a one-to-one appointment and give you testing to see what you can do.  They are like a temp agency and can find people a job but you must know how to drive.  Another place to look is like Kelly Temporary Services as I know they deal with manufacturing type jobs.  The job you want is something that doesn't require a lot of learning but one that you'll do the job over and over.  Sometimes the monetary compensation (money you earn) is on an hourly basis and sometimes it's on how many items you can produce in a day.  For instance, you could work in an ice cream packing factory or a company that makes boxes or even work as a warehouse runner, or a person who does xeroxing, faxing or shreading for a company, etc.  You could even work in landscaping and cut grass if you are in a mild climate.  You could do home cleaning, you could work in a restaurant cleaning dishes or as a restaurant host and take people to their table.|`|eWssw4kfaa	1) Take an aptitude test and test your basic knowledge. Prior to me taking the ASVAP Testing, because of my learning disability, I would have never guessed in a million years that I could actually do anything but menial manual labor jobs.   2) Get some basic training and make sure this career is right for you. I registered with the Va. State Department of Rehab Services in 1990. I have to admit that they did absolutely nothing for me, because they tried to push garbage classes on me but luckily for me the ASVAP Test that I took two years earlier and my persistence's I managed to (against their will) enroll in Electronics and Computer Classes instead, but they might do something for you.     3) Attend college in your respected field, expand your knowledge, and don't let anyone talk you out of it.  4) Keep your work in a portfolio and start networking.  5) Most importantly, keep a positive attitude and don't let anyone get you down. Believe in yourself and anything can be done.

Your washrags are even filthier by comparison.  So as for hygiene the lid doesn't make much of a practical difference.  There's invisible scum everywhere you go, much of it the exact same as what you find in the toilet.  Welcome to planet earth... which reminds me of a funny and ironic quote (although I can't remember who said it) regarding how the kitchen sink has more harmful, foul bacteria than your crapper.  It basically said that if an alien being were to come to your house and examine the bacteria within, with no knowledge of the purpose of each room and fixture, it would probably think it should drink from your toilet and crap in your sink.  I thought that was funny, although I'm sure the delicate little flowers who believe in all that etiquette crap don't find that fact very amusing... oh well!|`|3JGUIUEFaa	Why should I? It's just as easy to put it down as it is to lift it up. I have never fallen into a toilet -- mainly because I'm not retarded. Any woman that DOES is a total moron. I also have never pee'd on the lid -- because I CHECK IT before I go!!!!    Damn.|`|gbkMBA2raa	yes it is the rule and you do not break the rule|`|AA11429880	I never made a big deal of it when I was married.  I figure I can put it down just as easily as he can.  Considering all the stress that couples go through, I would think that this is a very minor issue.  I do have my own place now, so when my boyfriend comes over (though I've never had to ask him to), he always leaves the seat down.  I just think it's common courtesy for a man to leave it down in a lady's place, just as when I visit my male friend's house, I don't complain that his seat is up, it's man's apartment.|`|dIUvXolnaa	If I am in a house with males I look then make adjustments if needed. And males who live with women will do the same.|`|tby2YPftaa	Put the seat up when a guy P's,  then simply flush, and put it back down...

Do they live in wild or something?|`|b0N9Oh3oaa	I usually leave it down, but occasionally for a joke I leave it up. Man that's funny.|`|ASSbLOk6aa	It depends on the culture, In asia , we prefer the seats up, because the lazy boy just pees all over the seat, so the females consider it cleaner if the seats were up when they are in the toilet,|`|b2d574b8a654cff08132b97a7ed59201aa	In my own home, no. Everywhere else, yes, I put the seat back down. If it takes me minimal effort to do something courteous, I'm just going to do it and not worry about chivalry/feminism/blah blah.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	It will be all fair, if the boys leave the seat down for girls and then the girls leave it back up for the boys.   Whats good for the goose is good for the gander.|`|7DlEN6lXaa	There is a reason that toilets have lids.....When you flush the urine and water aerosol into the air and can go as far as 10 feet from the toilet. So next time you're in a bathroom and you flush without putting the top down you're breathing in the urine that you just got rid of. I don't know about you but I don't think our lungs were made to breathe that.|`|1ThWEediaa	Well i didn't get this question, but my answer will be YES i always drink milk.......................................|`|GqfiRXu3aa	I usually put it down even if a girl isn't present.  I mean, in the middle of the night, if I have to go, I don't want to sit on the actual toilet -- it's cold!!|`|o03seoMtaa	In my house the men always leave it down. It looks better, it's more hygienic to put the lid down when you flush and as well as that, men still need the toilet seat down sometimes whereas women never need it up. With that in mind, it makes more sense for men to put it down as they may need it down themselves when they next have to use the bathroom.     Plus, it's more respectful of women and will actually go a long way if a woman can see a guy is considerate enough to put the toilet seat back down after he's used it. If it's his own home and no women live there then fair enough, but if there are women likely to be present then it is courteous to put it down again.
a1x1tLqtaa	The flowers are beautiful and I think that she will love them. If you didn't tell her that you were taking her to dinner you should write that on the card and they take her somewhere nice. Since it is Valentine's day after dinner you should watch a romantic movie. I think that the picture frame is a good idea. You can get a picture frame that has three slots and then put a picture of her on the right you on the left and a picture with both of you in the middle (If in the picture of both you if you are on the right and she is on the left you should switch which sides each of you is on).|`|xb1x51Koaa	It sounds like a good idea.

G9R6VZOXaa	I think that I've been lucky and that I've never (personally) run into any issues because of my sexuality    However, one thing that really hacked me off last year was that my leave was refused at one point because it was during the main school holidays, and I was told that because I didn't have children, I should let others with brats have the holiday instead.  I thought that unfair, particularly as one of the days was my birthday!    I work in HR so have seen a fair few L&G people raise grievance cases feeling that they've been hard done to because of their sexuality.  Many are simply playing the "gay card" as a weapn and I've oly once upheld a complaint against a manager.    I've also had the uncomfortable experience of where another gay man in the office has put pressure on me to give them a promotion, citing that because I was gay, and so was he, I should cut him some slack and "do a brother a favour".  He was less than politely told where to go.|`|yegDdZfRaa	Why are you making your sexuality an issue in the first place? Don't advertise it.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Sometimes yes, but its not direct its more indirect.  eg) Could you work on Christmas eve for me, I'd like to spend that time with my children and family and since you don't have those obligations would you mind? Arg I hate it! Normally I just inform them that I have a family obligations just like them and that since I was there last year its their turn!

If you are drunk, it not only spoils your health. it shatters your family and creates a social problem.In that sense, it is better not to be a drunk. That's all there is to it.
rv2Iy1Y7aa	I like andreash's and T-half's responses and the question.    Do you really think it would be practical or desirable to go through life with the ability to read minds, hearing everyone's thoughts as they came within range of this ability.  It would be extremely mind-boggling unless there were extremely sophisticated filters built into the human brain.  People would be more crazy than they now are.  Still words would be necessary since ideas are conveyed through the symbols that compose words.    And, yes, there are those who believe the theory of a "Universal Mind".  There may even be some limited number of people who have been able or are able to tap into this universal mind.|`|V8Lyc2Jlaa	Niiice... Free meditaiton classes, anyone?|`|NfSLXHU3aa	The passionate way people say the words have far more meaning than the actual words themselves.    Having a 2 year old or teenager scream at me that I'm a mean old lady, really doesn't phase me.  But my dad calmly telling me he's disappointed in me, will devastate me.     However, folks who use poor grammar I stereotype them as being less intelligent.  Not always true, but that's my first thought.    People and voice tones give words power.
aeZUNltFaa	create a message box: they can bring in small boxes from home (can be cardboard. glue paper and decorations onto it then write their name on it other people come by and write nice stuff about them like: you are a really nice friend          here are some good games  VALENTINE BUS BANQUET    This is a fun way to celebrate friendships with a class, church group, scout troup.. First you decorate (or parent's, teachers, or adult sponsors) the inside of the school or church bus with the valentine theme. You must reserve the back seats of the bus for food preparation. You may wish to serve simple finger foods. You then take a bus trip around town and your adult sponsors serve you one dish at a time. (We recommend adults doing this especially since the vehicle may be moving!) Other adults or older teens can act as travel attendants (tour guides, ticket takers, song leaders, etc.) If adults dress and act the part it can be zany! If your bus has video monitors you may wish to show short cartoons.         MY PRINCE CHARMING    (A Couple's Game)    This is a fun game for couples. Place chairs facing inward in a circle formation. All the girls sit in the chairs with their boy partners on their knees in front of them. The boys take off both of their partner's shoes. The shoes are then thrown into the middle of the circle. Then each boy in blindfolded by their girl partner. On "GO" the boys must go (with verbal directions from their girl partners) and retreive their shoes and put each shoe back correctly on the appropriate foot. When both shoes are put on correctly the girl partner takes off the boy's blindfold. Continue the game until the last couple does it right!    Another version of this is to just have the boys on GO retrieve the shoes one by one not blindfolded.         ROMEO and JULIET    This is a great teen game. Arrange chairs in a circle and have everyone except IT sit on a chair. Blindfold IT.  IT then roams the circle until he or she sits on a person's lap and asks, "Are you my Juliet or Romeo?" The selected person answers in a disguised voice while IT tries to guess who it is. IT can only guess once. If IT is able to choose the right person then he/she replaces the person in the chair and the second person becomes the person in the middle.         HONEY DO YOU LOVE ME?    Here's a fun game that I've played many times, it's called, "Honey, do you love me?" This is a boy girl game. All of the girls sit in a large circle and then each of the boys draws a name out of the hat with one of the girl's names on it. Say there was three girls and their names were Julie, Jennifer, and Dawn. The boy that picks Julie will go over to Julie and sit on her lap and say, "Honey, I love you." Then the girl has to reply, "Honey, I love you, but you can't make me smile." She has to say this without smiling or laughing otherwise they are both out.                and here are some good crafts  http://parentingteens.about.com/od/craft...    there are a bunch of fun ones here|`|NSf16kWmaa	idk if this would be Vanentine related  but a teacher gave me a smarties (rool) in the shape of a cute bug, she useg googiley eyes and colored pipe cleaners for the leggs|`|dAltMxryaa	heyyy its me|`|RAtgv9GHaa	make some ? shaped cookies!!  and then give out val day pencils,everyone needs a pencil!!|`|0Cpqulbraa	ones that teach them about safe sex

TVJsOEKNaa	I'll start with the Torah reference:    "Of the beasts of the earth, you may eat any animal that has cloven hooves and chews its cud."  -- (Leviticus11:3 & Deuteronomy14:6).     After this, a list of animals (camel/rock badgers/hare/swine) are shown as non-Kosher because they lack one of the two qualifications (an animal may have split hooves, but doesn't chew its cud).     When looking at health concerns: Trichinosis is not the only issue. In fact, other diseases like hog cholera (classical swine fever), brucellosis and influenza can be a problem.  In the Middle East pigs consume more than their value as a food source as well.     These are not reasons that come from Jewish tradition and it should be noted that there are plenty of Kashrut laws which have no connection to health itself.  There is no specified reason in the Torah for these laws either.     I will state that Kosher meat surpasses FDA requirements by a long shot (No downer/dairy cows/stun gun/shootings are ok. The meat is also checked for any diseases personally).    Rabbi Donin states that these laws are designed as a reminder.  One's ability to distinguish right from wrong, pure from defiled, and sacred from profane, is very important in Judaism.     Imposing rules on what you can/can't do, ingrains self control when it comes to basic primal instincts.  The laws of Kashrut elevate the simple act of eating and turn it into a religious ritual.     It creates a symbolism where all of our actions should be infused with holiness and spirituality, no matter how basic.|`|EXgoY42saa	One hypothesis I've heard from a Bible scholar is that "unclean" animals for the Hebrews were ones that seemed "out of order" -- and pigs were out of order in having four legs like cattle and horses, but cloven feet rather than hooves. ("Unclean", btw, has little to do with germs, and more to do with stigma, like long hair on a Marine.)|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: that was probably a very big part of it but there's also the fact that pigs don't have necks.  They can't be killed in a humane way required for food to be declared kosher.    No, killing of an animal is done by an extremely sharp knife drawn across the throat in one motion, severing the arteries and nerves quickly. A spike in the head isn't considered humane.    Pigs will also eat anything, including each other, dead bodies, literally anything.  That makes them unfit.  Animals that survive by killing other creatures are off limits, so are bottom feeding fish and carrion feeders.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	No, there is nothing to suggest that pork carried any more disease then than it does now, even with lesser technology.  All that is required is thorough cooking, which would have been well known to those people.|`|VFmmVHGVaa	It was forbidden under Levitical law  t|`|8nKyRiahaa	there are also many other things they can't eat, like amphibians...frogs....even 'scavenger' fishes... Heck, I eat everything except tables & chairs.|`|4BQXYxPYaa	Well in my family, which is generally secular, pigs still carried a stigma of being unclean and trichnosis was a major fear of some of my relatives.    Religious jews and muslims believe pigs are just spiritually unclean and leave it at that..."unclean because God said so" essentially.    If we wanted to look for actual reasons, then yes, there is trichonosis. Also most domestic animals were raised not primarily to eat, but to make goods from. Sheep gave wool, cows gave milk which could be made into butter, cheese, or cream, chickens gave eggs. Killing an animal to eat was only done on rare occasion because it usually resulted in a great loss for the family. But what could a pig give you?    Essentially nothing unless you kill it.    On top of that, they can be aggressive, and their non-heard behavior probably made them difficult for nomads to keep.|`|VgPQM5W2aa	Yes.  The biblical reason is that pork is "unclean," meaning that they probably realized you could get sick from eating it.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	In the Old Testament God tells them that they cannot eat from unclean animals or splitters of the hoof. But in the New Testament that was changed.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Still living in the old testament.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	The problem with that theory is it doesn't explain how Jews were aware of this problem but no one else was.    The Torah laws deal a lot with deciding what is pure aand what is impure or blemished.  You're not supposed to wear clothes made of two different threads, for example.  most of the forbidden foods are animals that don't fit into basic categories.  For example, there are several birds who can't fly on the list.  Shrimp and other shellfish live in water but they have legs.    The Torah doesn't say you can't eat pig.  It says you can't eat any animal that chews  it cud OR is cloven, but not both.  It bans many animals, not just pig, so the dangers of pork doesn't realy address the entire ban.|`|5JQFCQCkaa	I think for Islam, a pack of pigs attacked a friend of Muhammad's.

It is well known throughout history that burning human flesh smells like burning pork. If fact the word for roasted human in neguinea and other languages is "long pig". Pork is the closest medium to human flesh. If you have ever heard a pig being slaughtered you will never forget the screams. In those ancient times because it reminded them of humans in many ways. It is not a surprise that the authors of the old testament would have a hatred or fear of pigs. In the Holy Koran, pig is regarded as filthy, because the Holy Koran is believed to be the next book after the old and new testament. The ark angel Gabriel visited muhammad in his cave, etc. there are many religions that have some sort of dietary requirement of the faithful, the Jews were not the first to have a distaste for the pig.

This might be taught in Political Science, or as an example of the disaster allowing politicians to control the teaching of science.    The word "controversy" is not useful in this circumstance.

Just don't get so caught up in it that you forget to teach the larger lessons.    To my mind, some of the most interesting ideas lie at the crossroads of a controversy. It's interesting to find out why two or three or nine groups of people consider their take on things to be the only true and correct view. However, the controversy, especially in a school environment, often takes over the teaching of more important lessons.    As an example, one of the school districts in my area voted quite a few years ago that they would not stop teaching "Huckleberry Finn" in high schools. They moved it from the 9th grade curriculum to the 10th grade curriculum, and agreed to discuss why it is so frequently a banned book. The problem is that there is an awful lot more to "Huck Finn" than simply the "N" word. Since that's what is cited most often when the book is challenged, they decided they would address that. The result was that 2 1/2 days of the week allotted for the study of the book was taken up by discussion of the controversy. You could, realistically, spend an entire month discussing that book and not get everything out of it, so it seemed a shame to me that they had to spend half of their time discussing that particular word. Should they touch on the controversy? Sure, it's a great idea, especially with a book which is challenged as frequently as that one is. Should they spend half their time on the controversy? No, that's wasting time.    I feel the same about New Mexico. And I also think there's something they may have overlooked. When their current science texts wear out, and they have to order new ones, they are going to have precious few choices which coincide with their wacky view of the universe. Someone's going to have to address the controversy!|`|a667XbKPaa	Just leave them alone they aren't hurting anybody.

8oSDgfCCaa	Your question sort of assumes that all reality is contained by or is confined to what we are confined to: time-space. Look into quantum mechanics.    Well, in Taoism which holds that "the Tao" is the only real thing in existance and anything else **we may perceive** is only an extension -- if I remember correctly the Tao both "precedes" and contains space and time.    In ancient egyptian theology which the "three abrahamic faiths" descend from: all that exists was created from and will return to the entity (sometimes "Nun" sometimes "Atum" who is other times associated with "fire") associated with the *boundless* "dark primeval 'waters'".    So perhaps "before time" refers to a principle *outside of* time or that isn't dictated by time or conditional. The creator is supposed to be eternal, correct? Just because time is an inescapable part of your reality doesn't make it an inescapable part of "God's".|`|dZMHd5PMaa	B/c I beieve that our concept of time and God's concept of might not be the same. I think that none of us really know nor will we know until we can ask him ourselves. Yes I am a creationist and I do believe that everything started with God and will end with God, but I don't pretend nor will I ever claim that I know what "time" is to God. Just like the 6 days. Do I believe that God created everything in 6 days and rested on the 7th yes b/c the Bible tells me he did. Do I believe that God's 6 days and our 6 days are the samething. I don't know.|`|8IHfytEvaa	Time was created in the beginning along with the heavens and the earth.    Even Einstein believed that time was the 4th dimension.

If you trace the universe back 13.7 billions years you will see the universe began at a finite point in time. Cosmic singularity. There may be some spiritual element to existence, this is still being debated|`|fOKssTulaa	Before time..before space..    In the Begininning there was nothing.    In the very beginning, there was a void - a curious form of vacuum - a nothingness containing no space, no time, no matter, no light, no sound. Yet the laws of nature were in place and this curious vacuum held potential. A story logically begins at the beginning. But this story is about the universe and unfortunately there are no data for the very beginning. None, zero! We don't know anything about the universe until it reaches the mature age of a billionth of a trillionth of a second - that is, some very short time after the creation in the Big Bang. When you read or hear anything about the birth of the universe, someone is making it up. We are in the realm of philosophy. Only God knows what happened at the very beginning.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Yes, time is a characteristic of the physical universe.  Prior to the Creation of the universe there was no such thing as matter, energy, space, or time. God exists outside of time, in eternity, as we all will eventually. The universe, including time and space, will cease to exist, and only eternity will remain.  If you think that the universe, or any element of it, always existed, you reject the most fundamental tenet of science - causality. In science, things cannot exist without coming into existence and things cannot happen without a pre-existing cause.|`|zMcHYQeBaa	Yes, it is hard to understand if you want to put limitations on God.

Godspeed.|`|pbT0tJvqaa	Yes there is, it's called eternity where time is of no effect. It has no meaning. God is eternal, time is a dimension we use to label things that happen. If you study the Bible you will learn that God can see all of time as we know it at once. Read Revelation, John talks about going up to heaven and seeing things that had not yet happened in time but he seen them like they were happening right before his eyes. God says he is the alpha and omega he sees the end from the beginning. I am hoping that I will be able to do that when I get to heaven, it would be wonderful to see the creation happen, see the flood, see the Red Sea parted, see Jesus on the cross and know what he went through to give me a chance at eternal life. See Him come out of the grave. How awesome is that!!!|`|vTzxxSTLaa	Time is a prison locking us  always in the present if you can grasp that then know that God is not locked in that prison.

Por lo tanto, cada quien hablaba y escriba el espa?ol como mejor lo comprenda. En realidad Ni siquiera era Espa?ol, sino Castellano.    Y algunos de los descubridores de Mxico acostumbraban pronunciar la "X" como "j". Pero en realidad, Mxico no Proviene del Espa?ol o del Castellano, sino del Nhuatl. Y algunos frailes del Siglo XVI trataron de asimilar los sonidos Nauas a los carcteres latinos, siendo la "x" la que se utiliz para designar un sonido similar al : "csh", por lo tanto, "Mxico" se pronunciara ms o menos "Mcshico".    Pero la sonorizacin de los espa?oles le daba un sonido muy fuerte a este vocablo, resultando como "Mjshico", que deriv en "Mjico", y en el siglo XIX el sonido se formaliz como si fuera "j" y no en su original "csh". La verdad es que Mxico nunca se ha proninciado "Mcsico" y slo lo pronuncian as los que leen la "x" sin conocer ni una pizca de Espa?ol.    Y la forma correcta de escribirse no se debe buscar en el diccionario, sino en la Constitucin, y ah est escrito como "Estados Unidos Mexicanos", nombre derivado de "Mxico".    Pero no es la nica excepcin a la regla de la "x", pues en Mxico decimos "Xochimilco" como "Sochimilco", y "Xaltocan" como "Jaltocan", incluso algunos preferimos decir "Jilografa" o "Jilfono", aunque se escriba Xilografa o Xilfono. Y por supuesto que "Texas" se dice "Tejas", pues su nombre proviene del siglo XVI, pero los EU no lo supieron Pronunciar. En realidad el que la Real Academa diga que Mxico se puede Escribir con J se me hace tan absurdo como decir que Espa?a se puede escribir Espana, o Espagnia o Espagna o Espania.    Y la ONU ha decretado que cada pas tiene el derecho de decretar su propio gentilicio, o sea que si los Mexicanos por ley decimos que se escribe Mxico, as es como se debe de Escribir.

I know who come to learn. Learn about other people's thought and opinions. Learn about how to do certain stuff. Learn about stuff that contributes to our lifestyle or curiosity. Some people come here thinking it will be a serious place with facts. But then they see a question that is far from serious and learn to 'goof-off'. As to people wanting to agree, it could be on purpose. Wanting to feel and already know they are 'correct'. And some choose to agree, as they were leaning to what they thought but dared to question, since they weren't sure with themselves. Depends the question/situation, of course. And as technology/internet separates us from being with others, we are naturally becoming or are lonely and come to place like these.|`|xpiGWrdMaa	Yeah.  And for people who aren't lonely but have no life like me.

I am far from being lonely. I have a girlfriend and I go to parties nearly every week, going to see "Taken" this Saturday with my girlfriend.     ANYWAYS    Yahoo Answers believe it or not is a better site when it comes to knowledge compared to sites like Myspace or Bebo (where everyone is either hick or ghetto). On Yahoo Answers, conversations are limited as you can only post once per question, and this site actually has everything separated into categories. You will be SURPRISED to see how many kids go on the "Homework Help" section just to look for advice on certain problems. The math section is useful for kids who cannot afford to go to tutoring, so there are people there to help you with math. Sometimes people feel the need on some sections like this one to exert their hidden intelligence and to share their views on things that they cannot do so in real life.    I mean seriously on here people can cure their curiosities and ask questions that if they ask those in real life they will be called racists, pariahs and bigots.  Someone on yahoo answers may ask    'Why are ghetto Blacks so violent?"    If someone asks that in real life, well you know what happens (OOOOOO he racists @_@).    Yahoo Answers is a diverse place, it has its good sections (this one, education, and homework help) and its sections where people like to be idiots and give best answers to those that agree with them (culture and groups and hip hop).     I'd take Yahoo Answers over the myspace groups/boards and bebo anyday.|`|Ig8oeFs4aa	yeah it probably is alot of questions on hear are dumb. mine are|`|3gNtHLsOaa	ya so true! like all the people who are all like "I am pregnant Help!" your ether REALLY lonely or just bord|`|1a7b79661e80924dde45df318f36f2a3aa	Oh .

a935190420cf7f85bd545e01d3d40854aa	Well, its a bonus if the guy is rich. But its not really a criterion, for me. As long as the man can support a family and he is a decent provider, he doesn't have to be filthy rich.  If a guy is financially unstable however, a girl would think twice about going out with him because then it could pose a potential problem when it comes to settling down.  After all, when you're hungry, love can't keep you alive.|`|7c6d7b25f213bb9d336a8622e2a37b79aa	Initially it must add something that the guy is solvent, especially these days, but without the spark.... just look at Paul McCartney, it was obvious she just married him for the money, definitely you need that spark, sadly while men want tall skinny blondes, girls want to be wined,dined and cared for.|`|410dae11130b64bc5903c121d75d9fc3aa	In reality.... it does add some pts. To me and other REAL WOMEN, money isn't the end. If u have a good job and can support yourself instead of mooching off someone else.... THAT ADDS POINTS! U can have the lowest paying job in the world but if u are independent... it works. Plus I think any man who flunts his net worth it get women deserves a shallow broad because he must be a shallow as her to think money equals happiness!  If the situation was the woman was rich... she might want a rich guy just because it would make her rest easy that they aren't into her for her money. If the woman was poor... it might be different. Bad situations bring out the worst in ppl and being poor is what causes some ppl to rob and sell drugs and etc. So if they do meet a rich person, it would only give them more points for the simple fact of hope. I'm not saying this is truth for everyone but I'm saying my opinion aka what I would consider if it was me. Idk... like I said I guess it depends on the person.|`|a91eca05b0f0d3d1789820b7a5d30fd1aa	23.98364527734000 points.....just kidding..      seriously...for me it's 25 out of 100 points.....

VxozKUcCaa	There is a European legend of a creature called a tween witch is a soul that is trapped in a type of limbo that cannot pass from that world onto any form of Heaven or Hell.  So this creature's motivation is to follow a living soul around until just before its death (sometimes actually causing the death) and then to take that soul's place when it is their time to move on.  Thus the tween is the one that actually moves on to another existence and the soul it followed around becomes the new soul trapped in Limbo.    The myth suggests that someone who shows signs that they are corrupt inside or making strides to make themselves healthier will make the tween less interested and it will then seek out another soul.  If you are corrupt inside the tween will have nothing to do with you as it figures when you die you will move on to a lesser existence or damnation when your soul moves on.  In the case of you doing things to make yourself healthier the tween will loose interest as it is very impatient and wants to move on as soon as it can.  The later means that the tween will have to wait longer before it is your time to die.  Signs that you have a tween following you include hearing faint voices talking to you, your reflection in a mirror will cast two shadows in the background when on your side of the reflection there is only one shadow and you will constantly be tempted into doing dangerous adventurous activities (or even more so if you are someone that already likes doing these things.)
Nf0FLjGhaa	two words: confirmation bias  the article itself states that this "evidence" only holds up when excluding certain indivuals. they're making the data fit their hypothesis, a fatal flaw in the scientific study|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Thats a pretty small sample to draw any conclusions from.

God LOVES YOU and He will speak to you just like He speaks to me or anyone else...no respect of person.
TjPwxbuJaa	I have my ears stretched to nearly 1 1/2 inches, so I know what I'm talking about. I have not had a "blowout" and have minimal scarring, and my ears just keep stretching on their own now.  A 'blowout' is just the tissue that gets pushed out the back of the hole because it tore while inserting a too-large piece of jewelry. Once healed, it is difficult to eliminate, but you can soften the tissue with Vitamin E oil and leaving jewelry out at night. Leaving jewelry out allows more blood flow to the lobe, making it much healthier.  Interestingly, from what I understand, the effect of blowouts can go down as the hole is stretched larger, assuming it is done properly. It will still take you many months to go from 5/8 to 1 inch. I only stretch mine up about 1/8 inch 2 or 3 times a year now.  Best of luck.|`|c9b39ba1619a86eb939cf1b78c3d4a15aa	man what the hell are you talking about?
7HoI6diYaa	I'm NOT gay so I might actually be offering the most valuable advice.     -Clarify that your not interested in him, you know he's straight, and you just want him to respect who you are    -If your in school, the best bet at keeping your friendship would be to not come out of the closet completely.  Now I really hate to say this, as people have the right to live how they want (or are, for that matter), but lets face it... kids are mean, prejudice little Nazi's that will stop at nothing to torment those who are not the same.   They will likely not only ridicule you, but your friend as  well (probably labeling you as a couple).  The best bet to keep your friendship would be to keep it just between the two of you, and those who can keep a secret.      But if you're brave, and your friend would support you, do as you please.    Good luck!|`|FCRGHlicaa	Well, one of the biggest things that helped me was to not make a big deal out of it... i also told him that i was telling him because he meant so much to me, which made him realize that he should be supportive... Great luck, i'm sure you'll be fine!!!|`|lpDXCQwoaa	If he walks away because you're gay. Don't call him your best friend, or even a friend for that matter.The only way to tell your best friend is to directly tell him.|`|ylzPAWaxaa	If he is truly your friend he will support you for who you are. you should never have to hide from you best friend.     hell I told my best friend at a church camp after I messed with him in his sleep and he woke up to it. he is totally straight and he was a little weird around me for a few days but just give him his space and be open for him to come talk to you.|`|szIR4ahcaa	I know it is one of those things that is easier said than done, but honestly..... tell him you're gay.    It really shouldn't be that hard.    What I'm saying is if he leaves you then he was never a true friend anyways. Honestly, just tell him, and maybe he'll not only feel closer to you at that moment but he might have some "secrets" to share as well.    There's many ways you can do this. Here's what I did 6 months ago and it worked:    *This way may take a little while, but it's most effective. Wait for somebosy (ANYBODY) to bring up the na,e of a hot girl he likes.  Make sure you're friend is there. When they're talking about the girl, act uninterested.    *Later, when you see your friend, say "____ was a bit too much into that girl, huh?"    *He will either agree or ask if you're gay. If the latter, then you'll know what to do. If the former (he agrees) then say something along the lines of "i just don't get it. I don't think she's hot. I don't think she's attractive. I just never had this attraction that he's always talking about"    Keep a very calm tone throughout to "set the mood"    By this time, you're friend should be understanding and compassionate (if he's a true friend) and then say [sigh] "_____. I want you to kn    Assuming you do this correctly, it will work. The way it works is that you set the mood through the tone of your voice and then slowly, as if you sound sad/different, pour out your heart. I do it all the time and my friend cant help but listens to my great stories    We all have tough decisions to make. get going! :)|`|kz06wH7yaa	I'd say just go for it, I came out to my best friend years ago and he completely accepted it. If he doesnt then he doesnt deserve to have you as a friend.     Im actually surprised you told your sister first, I think your the first person I know who told family before friends.    Anyway you'd be surprised by how accepting people are even if they seem like the types that would freak out.    After i told my two best mates we had a bit of a thing where they'd jokingly slag me about being gay or id pretend to come onto them and stuff and after my other friends found out, one of the ones who was the most freaked out actually gave out crap to them for it because he thought they were serious and he was the guy who i was worried would hate me.    Anyway Good Luck whatever you choose

NwF33thlaa	For me, a quick thanks to the Lady Sekhmet and the Lord Anubis usually does it. If I want to ask for their favor, I will hold a full on ritual. But that is just me.    Edit: I draw no comparison with Christianity. So the person below me is making a generalization. How rude of them.|`|a8kAassWaa	Wicca is basically a religion that is about minding your own business and living peaceably with your neighbors and environment. Wiccans are eager to draw parallels between themselves and biblical Christianity for the sake of earning credibility, but what does the Bible have to say about this religion? You wont find the word wicca in the Bible, so lets evaluate the beliefs in light of what God says about them.    Wicca spells are idolism Romans 1:25 says, They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things, rather than the Creator Who wants to settle for second best? In Isaiah 40, God paints a very cool picture of how much greater the Creator is than His creation. If you are worshipping anything besides the Creator, you are just spinning your wheels.    Wicca spells bring false hope  Hebrews 9:27 says, Man is destined to die once, after that, to face judgment. God says we get one chance at life, and that is it. There are no do-overs. If we dont accept Gods gift of Jesus in our lifetime, He judges us as unwilling to be in His presence, and we are sent to Hell.    Wicca spells bring disillusionment  Mark 7:8 says, You have let go of the commands of God and are holding on to the traditions of men. God is God, and we are not. We have a decision to make. Are we going to take God at His word and adopt His worldview, or not? Knowing God is hard work that takes a lot of discipline. Wicca is a religion that takes a pack of lies, ties it in a romantic ribbon, and searches out a well-intentioned, but lazy and gullible mark to sell its hollow doctrines.    Deuteronomy 18:10-12 says, Let no one be found among you who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spellsAnyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD... Wicca witchcraft is a sin and God hates it. Why? Because it is an attempt to cut off our dependence on God and get answers apart from Him.    This is what sin is all about. Sin isnt just a heinous, socially disagreeable action. Sin is our decision to disagree with God on any topic  to rebel against Him. Sin is saying, God, I want to live my life MY WAY. Romans 3:23 says, For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Romans 6:23 says, For the wages of sin is death This isnt bodily death, this is spiritual death: eternal separation from God and all the blessings that His presence brings. This is the definition of Hell: the absence of Gods presence. That is what our sin buys for us.    Thankfully, Romans 6:23 doesnt end there. It goes on to say, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. God knew that we would all rebel in one way or another, and he provided a way for us to avoid that separation.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Wicca doesn't require specific prayers. If you feel the need to talk with your gods, talk.  We most commonly work through meditation, but the specifics of that are up to you, and if you just want to "pray" that's certainly your perogative|`|cECRv4NMaa	What is there that confuses you, since I give thanks to the god and goddess everyday and invite them into my life. I do it for meals, the beauty of the day, the blessings which fill my life. I hold rituals during the sabbats and espats to honor my deities. I live my beliefs. Now if that means that I am similar to Christianity, than so be it. I do not draw those similarities since to me we are no where near the same. If that is confusing, though I don't know why, so be it. I am nothing like what those Christians who claim to know Wicca and say it has to do with a devil I don't even believe in.|`|oyzqMuALaa	I do monthly rituals which mostly consist of lighting candles and getting some quiet time to reflect and ask my mother goddess for blessings upon my loved ones.  It's a monthly thing, and every Wiccan have their own special way. you can try to make up your own ritual, use what you have.   When you make a ritual or spell, you add your unique "finger print" and individuality.   just as long as your wishing for blessings and not harm upon yourself other others.|`|4q9OEbnOaa	Followers of the Pagan faiths generally use meditation as prayer. To meditate is simply sitting comfortably, visualizing the God/Goddess, bring them within you, talk to them or ask a favor, and work with them to find the balance and harmony you need in your life. Many Wiccan writers have prayers they have done for themselves, but remember it is theirs. Write your own, recite to yourself, and if it accomplishes the desired effect, keep it to use again. Wicca, Druid, Asatru, and others use the 8 Sabats and 12 Esbats as time to meditate, but you can do it whenever you want to. There is no set time or day.

"Urban" is used to describe them because most of them take place in a modern city environment, where most people now live.  Old folklore principally concerns the places where people used to live long ago, which was mostly rural.    Urban legends were passed along principally by word of mouth before the advent of the internet.  Now they are passed more often than not via emails.  Like all folklore, they have certain properties:    * they change over time, acquiring new details, but the basic story     usually doesn't change.  * they are unverifiable, or often demonstrably false although some are     based on real events.  * they usually carry some kind of a moral or warning  * they are often told of either a famous person or a "friend of a friend".      One rarely hears one that is told in the first person.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	There was an urban legend that Coca*Cola was being made in Germany for the nazi's! It is a myth but is often told as truth!

AA11648578	Well do you think that Jesus taught Judaism? If so why are Jews not practicing Christianity?|`|wU0c3i7baa	I agree with you. I don't think that Jesus meant to start a new religion, I believe he intended to reform and tweak Judaism. Jesus never instructed anyone to turn their back on Judaism, he just made amendments and suggestions about how to live better lives. It was really his followers who founded Christianity and converted others long after his death.    I cannot understand how Christians can adopt the Torah/Old Testament as 50% of their scripture, but cherry pick the bits they choose to observe and follow. There are 613 Commandments in the Torah. There's an entire text of instructions in Leviticus that Christians don't adhere to.     For example, circumcision is one of G-d's MOST important commandments. He orders that baby boys be circumcised 8 days after birth rain or shine, in the midst of a crisis, even on the sabbath. Jesus was circumcised. Why don't all Christians circumcise their sons even though it's was important in the Old Testament (the word of G-d) and to Joseph and Mary?     The same can be said for not eating pork and shellfish. Jesus did say it's more important what comes out of your mouth than what you put in it, but he did not say that dietary law was null and void.     Jesus' last supper was Passover. Even as a prophet with new information from G-d, he still knew it was important to honor the exodus from Egypt. Shouldn't Christians celebrate Passover in that case?    The Bible refers to Jews as the "Chosen People" countless times. If you believe that the Bible is the word of G-d, then you can't ignore this fact. Jesus was a practicing Jew, so to me it makes sense that those who believe in him follow the tenets of Judaism as well.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	The first Christians considered themselves still to be Jews.  Read the Acts of the Apostles and Paul's letters.  Honest Catholicism is not against Judaism and is not antisemitic.  Most of those first Christians considered Christianity to be the continuation of and fulfillment of Judaism.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	There is no "chosen" religion.    Every culture tries to claim that it is "chosen" above all others.  The Chinese believed that their kingdom was the center of the universe.  The Japanese believe Japan to be humankind's place of origin.  The Incas called themselves the "Children of the Sun."  Nazis believed Aryans (in this context, Germans; the Nazis apparently didn't understand that "Aryan" describes an ethnic group encompassing all Caucasians, most all of the Middle East and Northern Africa, and Central Asians and Indians) to be the "chosen race."  The Aztecs called themselves the "Sons of Quetzalcoatl."  Even manifest destiny and anthropocentrism fit this type of idea.|`|1iKEQ6yYaa	Well Israel is God's chosen people|`|QQqhzuNDaa	Jesus was a Jew. As was the first Pope (Peter). Jews were considered "the chosen people". Due to their persecution the last few thousand years, not an enviable designation. 99% of people either follow the religion they were born into, or none at all. If you were born into a Hindu family, you would be Hindu. If born a Muslim, you would be Muslim. Etc. Strictly the luck of the draw. Very few people change faiths.|`|29e94afbd94c485d06730324281a018aaa	Its not about  a "chosen" religion. It about a "chosen people". Jesus hated religion. Religion is a set of beliefs created by man. So God will not chose religion but He will chose people (individually). Jesus taught of the Kingdom of God. And most people love their religion more than they love God.    The "chosen people" are Israel but not Israel that some may think. Jesus said that flesh & blood CANNOT inherit the kingdom. Jesus told Pilate that His kingdom was NOT OF THIS WORLD. After all God is Spirit.    There is a false idea that there are many ways to reach God.  There is only one God so there can be only one way-His way. And if His way is through Jesus, who are we to think we know of better ways to reach Him with our "religions". After all we are just "grains of sand".|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Well, there is no "chosen" religion since they're all fake, but I'll entertain your question.    First of all, Jews don't think of Jesus as the Messiah. So Jesus' opinion isn't that important to them.    Second, yes, Jesus was a Jew, but he DISSENTED from Judaism to form his own cult (Christianity, as it was later known). So... he wasn't exactly a "good" Jew, whatever that means.    So, no, Judaism isn't the "chosen" religion. Every religion thinks they are the "chosen" ones and they will all try to give you a million bullsh*t reasons why.|`|OUcQjqI0aa	Christianity was originally viewed as a sub-sect of Judaism|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	Well... maybe it is, but Jews don't believe so :-)  We believe Judaism is right for us, but we also believe that all righteous people have a place in the World to Come; we don't believe that you have to be Jewish to be righteous.      I personally don't see any reason that there wouldn't be room for everybody; if indeed God exists, then God is by definition infinite (at least by any definition I understand), so why SHOULD any decent person be excluded?|`|KvwVBzb0aa	Wasn't being a Jew a race rather than a religion in Jesus' time?

The religious leaders in Jesus time on earth were not practicing what they knew was God's law. That is why Jesus rebuked them and that is why they hated Him and crucified Him. Start in the New Testament and it will tell you the whole story and you may get a better understanding of the reason Jesus came to save us.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	This will give you a good answer: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/...|`|Qy4k1w1aaa	Jews do not believe that Judaism is the "chosen" religion. The Bible tells us that God considers Jews his "chosen people" which means that they are chosen to follow a very strict set of laws (in the Torah). By no means do they believe that other people need to convert to Judaism to be considered good people.    Many other religions do consider themselves the "chosen" religion and that all other religions are wrong and will lead to damnation. Mormons are particularly famous for saying that they are the only Church that has the full truth and that they are the only way to get into heaven. Some Christian sects preach that if people do not accept Christ in the manner that they prescribe the people will be damned to hell. And so it goes.    Sometimes I think that John Lennon had the best solution: "Imagine there's no heaven/ It's easy if you try/ No hell below us/ Above us only sky."|`|ba48cf52f1454313aee75768941cd919aa	we are the "chosen people"... but simultaneously christ-killers.
