I was very disappointed in it. Nobody is going to even think about the message. They'll just say "hey did you see those hot girls on the PETA commercial?" No one will even pay attention to the message. They should have showed videos of the animals being mistreated, or given facts about how they are severely mistreated, i think they were very stupid and don't seem to really think of how they can do a good job on sending out their message. This was a good chance to promote it considering how many people watch the super bowl, and they screwed it up. What does everyone else think?

20090128180149AAzUBoV	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Better to let food sit, keep it warm, or refrigerate and reheat?	My husband is home from work at 10pm, and that's when he eats dinner.  The rest of us eat at around 6pm, and the food stays out on the table until about 7.  For the three hours between 7-10, what do I do with the food, considering health, ease, and appeal?  Things can grow in it while it sits on the table, it can overcook if I keep it warm, and putting it in the fridge means it's still warm when I first put it in there, and it's barely gotten cold when it's time to take it out and microwave (and the microwave doesn't always produce appealing results).  Nothing's ideal, but what's best?  Thanks.

20090128175806AA7N30l	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Hello Please help me Por Favor (preferably vegetarians and vegans and doctors)?	Well hello. I'm 18 years old and am a lacto-vegetarian but am starting to go on a more vegan approach. I can't seem to stop losing weight. I staretd being a vegetarian in mid July and now it's been about 6 and a half months and I lost a total of 113 lbs. I eat twice a day now, since I had fainted supposedly and now my mom has been making me eat breakfast (which i nevee really ate before i even deciced to turn vegetarian). I eat mostly wheat bread sandwiches with avocado, rice and beans mostly everyday( i don't put rice and beans on my sandwiches everyday) That depends on what either I or my mom has made. And now I'm starting to recently eat "vegan meat" and putting some of that in my sandwiches. (vegetarian and vegans know what I'm talking about). I get full with maybe 1 and a half - 2 sandwiches( i know that a diet high in fiber makes one feel full before getting the sufficient amount of calories). I feel so sore (my leges) when I wake up in the morning. It feels as if I have been working my legs out until the point where I can't even seem to take it anymore. I have been getting headaches and I do plenty of exercise. I play for 2 soccer teams and on my Saturday team, I have recently felt like fainting and  I have even been seeing doubles of everybody on the field. I recently ate at Denny's for the 1st time in 8 months( a veggie burger with fruit instead of salad, some 3 pieces of french toast, 1 cup and a half of hot chocolate at about 6 o clock, and before that at about 2 o clock, my mom made me eat a bean and cheese burrito w/ some rice) She weighed me and i weighed 167.8 on Saturday the 24th and this Monday i recently went to the doctor and i weighed 162. On New Year's Day i weighed 170. I talked to my doctor, but he was no help at all. Can i get your advice? Thank You So Much

It just seems like I've hit a road block and i can't make the transition to being vegan.         For all the vegans out there, what was the biggest help for you when you became vegan?   Ex: living close to a natural food store or vegan restaurant, moving out on your own, friends helping you, making the switch gradually, etc.      Also, do you guys have any tips for making the switch?
