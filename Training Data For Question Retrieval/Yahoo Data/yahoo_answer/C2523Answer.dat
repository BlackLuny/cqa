You can also search on the internet by using any search engine and using keywoards 'salvage recycling automobile'.
q4nrL1C6aa	The cost has gone up since I was there, but I think it's about $22,000 for the basic program (MTP) and Harley-Davidson.

69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	First thing I would do is repair that leak. It sounds like you have a trans line leaking at the radiator. It may only be loose. Try tightening the fittings. Don't get too rough with them though. You might snap it off. Do this and fill it back up with trans fluid and see how it acts. If it is doing correct again, you might think about changing the fluid. If the 96 model is like the 87 I used to have, you can't change the filter. You have to carry it to a trans shop or a dealer to have this done. The filter on my 87 was internal.|`|OgvkF5mvaa	lol i had the same thing with my civic happened to me found out i shattered the disk on tranny but get it town take it down c if its the trannY(take it to traanny shop) and then if it is the tranny get a new 1 or rebuilt that 1 and u should b good to go ones its on there  about ur leak it might b the seal that seals the tranny with motor   bout ur leak is it the bottom radiator hoes or is it like mine thaht then tranny gots line going to the bottom of the radiator? idf its radiator fluid change ur radiator bottom hose if its a tranny leak change ur hoses that connect to the radiator if applies to ur car ones thats done just had a lil tranny fluid u should b good|`|0TVenxJyaa	Chances are the damage is done, sorry to tell you this. Once an automatic trans slips like how you've described, most likely a clutch has been ruined.  You can attempt to refill it with fluid (after you fix the leak), but most likely it will slip again. In a last ditch effort you can flush the old ATF out of the unit and cross you fingers.

wFJ7S5Bzaa	as long as the frame and rear axles are the same width on both body types, which I think are pretty standard on GM trucks, you should be able to put a fleetside bed on it.

If they're not that bad, they could bend them back into place pretty good and slap some Bondo on it and make it look good from a distance, but it won't be perfect up close.
ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	No, I don't agree. This is a rare event these days and it just isn't economically viable to have the infrastructure to cope with the conditions. The media has been bleating on about the amount lost to the economy - what it doesn't tell us is the cost of maintaining vast fleets of gritters (and salt) and snowploughs, enough to clear every road in the country, for Network Rail to purchase enough snowploughs to clear all railway tracks for a once in a blue moon occurrence. I can remember the bad winter of 1961 when snow lasted for nearly 2 months in some parts, young feller me lad, and things were just the same then.|`|0IuWhmWUaa	Whether its a once a week or once a century...

So in the long-term it is a better use of our resources to keep the situation as it is.
iLTlJszaaa	Yes, I think Ford's cutting them down to fleet-production only has something to do with the increase in price value.  A similar phenomenon happened when GM cut production to the Chevrolet Caprice: police departments everywhere decided to hold onto and take good care of their 9C1's, and a sort-of underground cottage industry to refurbish and maintain them even sprung up.  Kind of like a "you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone" deal.  Another possibility could be the economy: since people are more reluctant to buy new cars due to the capital expense and lack of confidence in credit, more people may be interested in buying used cars rather than new, thus there is more of a demand, and people are willing to spend more for them.  That's a sweet car you've got there as I can see in the video.

j4GjtuVQaa	You need to be more specific.    Do you mean that you're "cleared for northeast departure"? That either means that roughly northeast is your on-course heading and they're clearing you to turn to that heading on departure, or the airport has something called a "northeast departure" that they expect you to follow. It should be in your instrument charts.    The way you know where the runways are is by looking at the airport diagram. For northeast you're looking for runway 4 (or anything in the 3-6 range).    I'm not sure if I'm understanding your question. It would be unusual to be "cleared to the northeast". You could be cleared to the northeast practice area, cleared for a northeast departure, cleared to the northeast ramp, cleared to the northeast run-up area, etc.     If you're not sure, ask!|`|3DOSC68naa	You have a compass in the aircraft.  also atc gives you and headings.

0B0ycKw3aa	Hello new driver :)    If you are a young driver attempting to find cheap and affordable car insurance you are probably already aware of the challenge that lies ahead. The statistics about teenage drivers arent good. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), 16-year-olds get into accidents almost six times more often than drivers between the age of 30 and 59. No wonder car insurance premiums are so high for this age group. It has always been difficult if you are aged between of 16 - 25 to insure your car affordably, and although car insurance companies are beginning to recognize the need to supply this ever expanding market, it can still prove to be hard to find a reasonably priced car insurance premium.    For instance, young drivers will often own older or less maintained vehicle compared to other drivers, which means they are more likely to break down and potentially cause an accident. Teenage drivers are also more likely to have accidents which can either injure themselves or the other party.    However, parents should be aware if the fact that there are several ways that can help lower car insurance costs for your teen. In order for teen drivers and car insurance to work well together, parents need to know the factors that will help contribute to paying less for their son or daughters auto insurance in the future.    The first thing that insurance providers look into when giving a car insurance quote is the driving record of the person. Teenagers that have a good driving record may merit consideration. What that means is that you can help keep your teen focused on safe driving by having him or her pay a portion of the auto insurance premium. Also, be sure to let your teen know the consequences of getting traffic tickets.    Before you purchase your car it is also worth researching which insurance group it will fall in, so that you can ensure you will be able to get the cheapest possible insurance.    Finally, by using Insurance4lessdirect.com you can rest assured that we will strive to find you the cheapest car insurance premium that will provide you and your teenager with the best cover.    Did you know: If youre adding your teen driver to your auto insurance policy, be sure to take advantage of the auto insurance discount for good students, available in many states.

6b241499c91029b41309ed54b7f64ba9aa	The fact that drugs were involved likely will have no bearing on whether the car's insurance company will cover the damages to your brother's car. As long as the car had valid insurance and other fine print circumstances were not occurring, the other driver's insurance should cover it. HOWEVER, if the car was stolen, then the owner's insurance would not be liable since the true owners would have been victims as well.     Since the officer gave you the insurance info for the other vehicle, it's not likely that the car is stolen. You'll want to get the claim started right away with the other insurance company to know as soon as possible whether there is coverage or not.     If the other insurance company states the drivers were doing an illegal act at the time (drugs would not likely count) such as fleeing the police, they may say that coverage is denied. If that's the case, I would argue that the damages to your vehicle did not occur during any hot pursuit so your damages should be covered.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	Why would the presence of drugs in the adverse car change someone's insurance?  That has no bearing on the insurance coverage.    Here's what you need to do:    Get the police report.  Find out if the other party has insurance.  Call the other party's insurance.  File a claim.    If your car is undriveable, move it to a location where the police won't be tempted to tow it, like your driveway.      You should call your own insurance anyways, and find out if you have any uninsured motorist PROPERTY DAMAGE coverage.  If you do, and the other guy has no insurance, you can still get paid out by your own insurance, usually for $3500.  However, if you didn't pay for that coverage, then you're S.O.L.    Good luck.|`|H0LfFGmlaa	Face the somber music. He'll probably lose his license and get probation.

In Houston, Dallas, LA, Interstates East of Pheonix and places like that 15-20 over is usually quite safe and ticket proof.     In West Texas or California I stay under 10 over. In New Mexico I stay UNDER the speed limit. NM is speed trap city if you have out of state tags. Especially Texas tags.     Denver I ignore the speed limits as they rely on speed cameras and don't ticket out of state drivers with camera tickets. I'd have a whole collection if they did as it took me a while to figure out why everybody was driving so slow. Thought I was in San Antonio or Lubbock the way people were putting along.    I get in a convoy usually way over. Out on the highway we'll trade off front and back doors and the relatively safe middle. Though one time I was in a group of about 7 cars when we zipped past a state trooper giving a guy a ticket. I got down to 100 when I ripped past him the lead car was doing an easy 110, I was third in the pack about that time.     So in that case depends on how fast I can travel safely. Many cars built today are just not designed to go over 85 or 90. They are too light and too prone to wind. Easy to start sailing as the wind builds up under the car giving you lift at those speeds reducing your control of the car.  If the weather is bad I slow down. If I can't see I slow down normally. Though in Florida during the summer it's sometimes like driving into a waterfall. Slow down and you get run over. You just follow the tail lights of the car ahead of you as that's all you can see and hope they don't drive off the road for the 10 minutes your in the deluge.

Use approved engine oil made specially for turbocharged engines.  Also, the turbocharger on the Evo9 is cooled by the engine oil. Allow the engine to idle and cool down for a few minutes (3-5 minutes) before shutting down the engine after using the turbo.  This will allow the cooler oil to circulate around the turbocharger, allowing it to cool down.  Extends the life of the bearings on your turbocharger and saves you $$$ on early replacement.|`|17f43d581f03d5d74492a3ffd7b6a9ccaa	If you drive it half way normal you may be able to keep  your stock clutch for a while.

gSKgj9V6aa	Simply put, better springs, shocks wheels etc. is not the answer.    The answer is to get a good set of springs that matches your car weight and weight distribution, shocks that match those springs, wheels and tires that match with those wheels and shocks.  All of that has to match your driving style.    How do you take a corner?  Do you slow down then accelerate when you turn?  Or do you come in fast, brake hard then turn?    Also, take into consideration environmental factors. Are you driving on asphalt or cement?  Is the road smooth or bumpy?    There are so many combinations possible and only a few of them will be to your liking.    Work on it slowly, one at a time.  Start with the springs.  If the springs suit you, then try changing the shocks.  Then wheels and tires.  Once you got it nailed, work on replacing the stock suspension parts with stronger aftermarket ones.  Like the bushings, brake rotors, etc.  The new parts will push the car to the limit and will take its toll on the stock parts.    Hope that helps.|`|jm0mnb2Kaa	aftermarket shocks

First setting should be 4x2 or 2 wheel drive mode.  2nd setting is 4x4 high speed or 4 wheel drive for high speed. Last setting is 4x4 Lo or 4 speed low gear with the center differential locked.  Use the last setting for very slippery mud or snow only.

6f8c350ecd3083faca2eb0e12c7c7673aa	You waste the same amount of gas with your ac on low as high, because that is just a fan control, the compressor under the hood is what cause you to use more gas and it is either on or off no speed control.|`|nheV7sZbaa	The a.c. fan speed does not affect the car's fuel consumption. What does affect the gas is the car's engine turning the a.c. compressor components by the motor fan belts to circulate the freon gas for the a.c. and the electricity generated by the alternator to keep the a.c. fan speed on during use plus keeping the battery charged.|`|gSKgj9V6aa	Yes.    The A/C compressor is what puts the load on your engine. The compressor has a clutch that engages whenever you turn the A/C on. The air temperature inside the cabin is controlled by the Thermostat. The Thermostat controls the air temperature by engaging and disengaging the A/C compressor clutch. To cool the air, it engages the clutch. To keep the air from getting too cold and prevent the system from freezing, it disengages the clutch.    There is a sensor just after the blower that senses the air temperature coming out of the A/C.  If its not cold enough the thermostat engages the A/C compressor clutch. If its too cold, it disconnects it.  If you have the Fan on High, more heat is drawn out of the cabin. When the fan is set to high, the A/C has less time to draw the heat from the air since the air passes through it too fast (but then you get more volume so air comes out half as cold but you get more than twice the amount of air coming out).  The thermostat senses that the air is not cold enough so it engages the A/C clutch longer than usual to keep up.

Or it could simply have a leak that needs fixed. Just have the leak fixed and have the AC recharged($60-$70)    Hope this helps!|`|gSKgj9V6aa	Check the fan belts.  The Fan belt for the A/C compressor may be loose.  It may need replacing. At 54K miles, my guess is that your car is asking for new fan belts.|`|AA11279264	usually it just needs to be recharged with refrigerant. turn on the ac and look under the hood to see if the ac clutch engages. it will turn on and off every few seconds. if it doesnt turn on at all or if its turning on and off very quickly oit needs to be recharged. do not try to do it yourself with the kits they sell at stores. its not the proper way of doing it, and you could get hurt in the process. just pay the 100 bucks and get it done professionally. it will be worth it in the long run
Dw5nJ8ZGaa	What a question does it ever?  I don't think so but I am sure that it does vaporate!|`|gSKgj9V6aa	I live in the tropics. I have an emergency generator on standby at home for emergencies.  I've had the gas in it for a over 3 months and the generator still starts up without hesitation.  That's 92 Octane fuel and the generator can take a minimum of 89 Octane.  The generator sits in a partial shade so it gets a lot of sunshine in the morning and gets wet when it rains.    Make sure you keep the tank properly sealed and as much as possible keep a full tank.  Less air in the fuel tank significantly decreases evaporation and prevents water from condensing in the tank during cold days.  If the fuel in the tank is going to sit there for over a year, I add small bottle of STP fuel conditioner or treatment. I had treated fuel in there for 18months and it was still fairly good.    Petrol doesn't lose its ignition point unless there is enough water in there to prevent it from igniting. And it has to be a significant amount (over 20% volume).  As the fuel ages it just degrades and goes down a few octane.|`|60b2a2e456bb4fd7ccdb247a79ff9c92aa	it will get water moisture long before losing the power..|`|AA11840179	hot weather, loses it gradually after 10 days,  cold weather 20-25 days|`|2fe0e0c5d1336ebdba6f2160fc68b6c0aa	If you leave fuel in your vehicle for a long period the jets etc can become gummed up and require a full carb stip down, but it would have to be standing for a good few months for this to happen, I know this because being a biker I regularly have bikes laid up for months on end and always drain carbs beforehand, but I dont think the petrol would be useless after such a time but as said earlier may become contaminated with water etc if not stored correctly|`|S8dBr3CMaa	should be okay for a year i reckon, have started and driven vehicles that have been laid up this long, recently repaired an engine that would not start after two years and the fuel in the tank was the problem,,  dipped a stick in the tank and tried to light it (well away from the tank!)   it would not ignite. drained and refilled tank and away it went

gSKgj9V6aa	Does it cut out regardless of how much volume?  If it only cuts out at high volume and ultra low bass then you dont have enough power. Get a bigger amp.    If it cuts out regardless of volume check the low-pass filter settings on your Head Unit. Or you can just disable it since your amp already does it. Adjust it to how much your sub can handle.  Check your HU manual how to make the adjustments.|`|6Yv3j9LUaa	Check for the specs of the sub, maybe the amp is working to the max because of it causing to stop working due to the overheating of the amp.

61DNTrc8aa	Geberally speaking you should not delete the C:\ partition. There are software packages that will permit resizing the partition, but it's very risky to mess with the C:\ drive.    If you are running low on space try:  1) Run Disk Cleanup and get rid of old files and Internet files          left laying around by the browser    2) Defragment your disk by running Disk Defragmenter    Both utilities can be located by right clicking on 'My Computer' and selecting 'Manage'...    Also adding a USB drive ( Western Digital has a 1 Tb, yes that's 1 Terabyte,  USB drive now) can allow you to off load non-essential stuff and save C Drive space.

vzUw8a93aa	In the United States, the driving age is determined by the state or territory, with the most common age being sixteen. The age for a license varies from 14 years 3 months to 17 years. Most states and territories also have learner driver's licenses (also called learner's permit), which allow a person to drive provided they are accompanied by a licensed driver.    In the U.S., minimum driving ages vary from state to state.

y93R1Na1aa	Depends on what you call safe. As long as you don't roll it over, an H2 is probably the safest because you can probably buff out the dent a Civic or Cobalt makes when it hits it, and best wishes to the drivers of the other vehicles. Actually, a Semi truck would be safer...    Start ratings are all relative. You can use them to make meaningful distinctions between cars of the same size, but physics always win. If two vehicles hit at the same speed, the heavier vehicle takes less damage. Bumper height laws really help small vehicles, but there are still older vehicles on the road.    That said, any car with front and side curtain airbags, ABS, and stability control will be safer than any car without those features.    Finally, choose a car with bright colors. Gray cars always get in more accidents because people don't see them. Daytime running lights help that a lot.    For my money, I'd get a midsize sedan or small crossover, as they have the best compromise of safety, economy, and functionality.

Fully dressed, with iron heads and an aluminum intake it weighed roughly 620 lbs. It's also got forged internals and a hotter cam, but the weight difference of that would be next to nothing.    What will make or break a big block being heavier or lighter then mine is the heads, get a set of nice aluminum heads and you can drop the weight to around 550 lbs or less. It isn't bad if you think that a all iron small block is around the same weight... too bad theirs no all aluminum big blocks like the LS1's though :(

CTybrL5kaa	Hello,  Gas mileage on jeeps is about average for SUVs, but I know from my experience with an all-stock 89 cherokee that they get around 24 mpg in mixed highway/city driving. My lifted 92 gets about 18mpg in mixed use, but it's got 32x11.5" tires and a roof rack that don't help mileage any. What driving style do you do? If you're only occasionally off road, any number of jeep like vehicles will do. Most tall wagons like those in the Subaru line are great for mileage in town and on highway and offer decent performance of unpaved roads for those remote trailheads and such. However, if you live/work/play frequently away from graded terrain, you need something that will get you there. The vehicles that handle rough roads are usually taller, with larger engines and poorer fuel efficiency.     Hope this helped,   Gerald|`|ajkMt6gRaa	Toyota FJ cruiser is a "jeep looking "  car and I think it has a lot of great qualities.

It is almost an infinite resource unlike fossil fuels.    The cons are:  Hydrogen is an explosive gas and easily combustible. A leaking hydrogen storage tank can ignite and explode.

I suggest you read several books from those that have already done what you want and then try to find someone to interview and get some first hand answers. Take a course in celestial navigation. Talk to some crewing agents about crew costs. Good luck.|`|KQhIcU4Yaa	A catamaran would not be the boat of choice for this.  You would want to have a monohull or a trimaran for many reasons.      Many boats capable of circumnavigating can be sailed single handed or by a crew of as many people as you like.  Boats of lengths as little as 20 feet and possibly less have been sailed around the world.    In this goal you are staring at the end.  Starting at the beginning is better.  Before someone learns how to drive, do they start looking to buy a motor home to drive across the continent?  Probably not.  More likely they learn how to drive, borrow a car for some time (mom and dad's) and eventually buy a car suited to where they live.  After they have been driving for some time and if they like to take longer trips, they might buy a motor home.    Take some sailing lessons, buy a small boat and sail day trips around your home port.  If you enjoy this, consider a larger boat if you need to for a weekend trip.  Take a trip for a week, or a month to see how you like being at sea for long periods.  By this time you'll know the right kind of boat to take the trips that you want to make.  That's the best way to go.|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	Nice question but first you need to experience the options to determine your level of comfort and security.  While Cats are friendly in docile seas they can present a problem in heavy seas.  You don't want to turn turtle in the middle of the Pacific....    Mono-hulls are generally better for Circumnavigation, that's why more of them have done it.  Once you've learned the nuances of the various types you need to make acquaintance with a good Marine Surveyor to aid in your selection.    You obviously don't have any experience so the next step would be to hire a Transient Captain.  Alternatively you can hire a captain from your intended destination but 'buyer beware'.    You'ld be a lot better off and spend about 1/3rd of the cost if you just fly to your intended destination and buy a boat to live on and sail the region.  If you can't get your head around that you'll never survive a circumnavigation.|`|QV4pXixkaa	judging from the questions you are asking, it doesn't sound as though you have anywhere near the requisite experience to attempt such a trip!    So first things first, go get the necessary experience and build up your qualifications.    As for ocean going yachts, there are many different types and makes to choose from that are all perfectly capable of long distance voyages.    At the same time, there are many plastic tubs that you would not want to attempt such a voyage in!    I'm talking generally rather than specifically about catamarans - I think you need to really consider exactly what you want from a boat before settling for a specific design; I'm not sure of your reasoning for asking about cats specifically.    Cats have made long voyages like that, but there are few good mulitihull designs that would be suitable compared to the far larger number of good monohull designs that complete long voyages all the time. If you're talking about big seas, then cats aren't so good - tip one over and it won't come back up as they are as stable upside down as the right way up!    The number of crew required all depends on a variety of factors - largely dependant on the type of boat you end up using. The important thing is to have a crew with sufficient experience - and of course an extremely experienced skipper!    So it goes back to my original point... do not even think about attempting this without building up the necessary experience!|`|I7NkFJo2aa	There are plenty of blue water boats well found for around $150 K - including some older but very competent Cats.  The extra dollars tend to be for the water makers, washing machines and air cons.....    Which are all valid if you have the budget and want a similar set up to a house.      A cat has the speed to be able to get out of the way of a bad storm in most cases.  A mono hull will handle storm conditions better in general.    But a lot of that is to do with the skill of the master and crew too.  Can get into trouble in a ten foot boat in six feet of water too.    I think you need to prioritise practical experience and get out on some boats similar to the class you wish to use and possibly own in time.    The crewing requirements are not great, and can be one if set up right.  It's all about the setup when it comes to cruising.  I can only advise on Australian builders.    edit    The choice of boat is less important than the skill and knowledge of the operator - which will tend to influence the type of vessel chosen.  I know of at least four blue water cruisers fully set up with current rigging and ready to go for less than Aus $200 k    In this market situation there are lots of bargains if you've got the cash.    The best advice I ever received was don't wait, get what you can afford and go now, not around the world to start with but around the bay for a start - get on the water and gain practical skills, knowledge and understanding.      Only then can you make an informed decision.

gSKgj9V6aa	Your engine breathes through the valves. In a 4 cycle engine there are 2 sets of valves. One is for intake and the other exhaust. Intake takes in air (if the car has a carburator, atomised fuel as well) and exhaust is where the by product of burned fuel exits.  The valves open and close on a specific timing. You cant have them both open at the same time. A lifter is part of the that system that pushes the valve to open.  The lifter is operated by a camshaft which controls the sequence of the movement of the lifters and therefore the opening and closing of the valves.|`|E9b9CXoyaa	valve are in the cylinder heads, usually nowadays most 4 cylinder cars are 16 valves.  2intake and 2 exhaust valves per cylinder.  Liter is a measurement of the size of the engine|`|AA12324972	Liters is how much displacement the engine is, and will give you an idea of performance and economy...ie engine size.    Valves per cylinder is an indicator of how well the engine can breathe intake and exhaust wise.  Four valves per cylinder today is fairly common...but engines used just 2 for a long time.|`|QWqEi3Eyaa	Well, if you see a 2.0 litre engine, that means that during a full engine cycle, the engine draws in 2.0 litres of air/fuel mix. Engine power is dependent on the quantity of air/fuel mixture ingested and the efficiency of its combustion and conversion into power. If you want to up the performance, you can increase the size of the cylindars, or increase the amount of mix (turbo/supercharger).  Valves are what let the fuel/air mix in, or out of each cylinder in an engine.|`|AA12261615	i own a shop,and you mean lifters ,well there what opens the valves up on it,so without them any car wont run right,and it they get worn real bad it wont run right either,there one of the main parts of an engine,any engine for that matter,even a lawn mower has lifters and valves in it,good luck hope this helps.
Kw6YxSgoaa	I don't understand why you personally would be repoing a car, but if you have paperwork showing that it is your car, you are able to take possession of it. Please notify the local police department and make them aware of the situation. Otherwise the car will be reported stolen and you will be pulled out of the car at gunpoint and then have to show the paperwork proving it is your car.   If the person that it is in possession of the vehicle is in car before the it leaves the property you have to release it back to them.|`|f1a2e6fef769da8ffdb1af509b66db3faa	The request for repossession is usually from the financier.

So it is possible that you could get a citation if there are any city ordinances allowing police jurisdiction in parking lots.

(You may say... well there will always be jerks... and that's true. And as that ignorant part of the population decreases... so will the programs like Black History Month.)    And there are plenty of White people who are above judging someone by the color of their skin... but I have seen too many times when, even in 2008, I have heard/seen racism and it has DEEPLY hurt my heart.    And don't be mistaken, here in America we may have our first Black president... but far too many of our children go to sub-standard schools in the cities.

The sound is fine, and the noise isn't terribly loud. My only complaint is that after about 2 hours, my ears begin to hurt. But since I am rarely up for more than 2 hours, it doesn't bother me. Hope this helps and happy flying.|`|j4GjtuVQaa	I don't buy headsets in your price range but I recommend whatever ANR headset you can find in your range.

I do not recommend skimping on headsets if you are going to stay in aviation.  My first headsets were cheap and I ended up using them for less than a year.

AA10568066	You are putting undue stress on the internal parts of the engine causing them to wear out faster. Your engine (and your transmission) are designed to cruise for long periods of time between 1000 - 2500 RPM. It can with-stand short periods of high stress (upper Revs). In short, think of it like this. The wear and tear on the engine and transmission of driving 20 minuets in 1st gear at 5000 RPM is equal to 66 minuets normal driving (1700 RPM). Or take away 2/3 of your engine and transmission's life span.    Your maintenance will be 3 times sooner since your engine is revving at three times the average RPM. This is for nearly all components from fan belt to engine oil and transmission oil.    With that said. Your Steptronic (BMW name for tiptronic) transmission will not overly rev beyond the RPM limit (redline). So technically you can do this with-out immediate harm but expect your engine and transmission to fail (if new) around 75,000 miles.|`|x8HYMeOZaa	Yeah it heats up the transmission fluid a lot and probably near the overheat range.  Also this is hard on the driveline with the on off the throttle but that's what they built the tiptronic type transmission for was to have fun with it.  Not really just to give you more control over the shifting.  So maybe check the transmission fluid after several thousand miles to see if it is changing colors yet and need replacing.  Although the newer german buggies have a sealed transmission and are not designed to have the fluid changed.|`|d7CWE1araa	No problems here.

It is important to pay attention to your surroundings and look out for yourself as the driver.  This includes, not driving in dangerous conditions (snow, ice, sleet, rain) and making sure that your vehicle is up to par as it concerns safety and maintenance.      *Laws of driving - I would say this comes second.  It is important for every driver to follow the rules of the road.  Knowing things such as which driver has the right of way, not exceeding the speed limit, regarding signs and knowing what they mean, understanding the role that emergency vehicles such as police and any other emergency responders.  Also knowing what to do when you are involved in an accident, knowing who is at fault and what to do with insurance issues.      *Being aware of your surroundings - Many drivers end up in accidents because they are oblivious to their surroundings.  They ignore changes in traffic, and they do not pay attention to others around them.  This can include, not being courteous to pedestrians, not seeing another driver in a blind spot, making mistakes on the road that come from using your cellphone and other distractions.  I would say this 3rd concern is major because many drivers ignore conditions of the road and they can be avoided if they pay attention.
2uPEty21aa	Speed cameras in roadworks are not listed.  Most roadworks have average speed cameras now, no flash.

Non-fixed speed cameras do not need to be listed, but there are usually signs posted saying "speed enforcement cameras" or something similar.

GihIl60Faa	If the wind noise is coming from the top of the doors, you can adjust the glass up and in a little to seal it.  If I am not mistaken, the window glass seals to the body which may be the cause of the noise.|`|AA11570236	Ya some car designs have wind issues.My friends Nissan Xterra has that and can do anything to remedy unless you take off all the luggage rack from the top.Not feasible.|`|oyFaDyLmaa	check if the windows are fully closed or there might be something wrong with the door im not sure how to fix it
eOO3cKZEaa	My first reaction was that a belt is loose in the power steering . Easy to fix if it is a V belt just a normal inspection adjustment that should be done periodically anyway. If it squeaks as you accelerate quickly that is another sign of a loose V belt , could be the air conditioner or alternator.   The  power steering pulley might squeak if the belt was loose and you turned the steering wheel all the way hard over one way or the other. V belts have less grip and slip easier when wet . That might have something to do with the cold effect you spoke of.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Power steering belt is loose or it's low on power steering fluid.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Try the belt that drives the power steering pump.  Also replace the alternator V belt at the same time.  They will squeal something fierce when the belts get glazed and are not put on tight.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	It sounds as if you've got a few things going on here. If you look at the  inboard side of the brake rotor you will probably find your metal -      on- metal culprit. Don't tear open those boxes too fast though.      The squeal from the steering wheel turning sounds like it may      be an additional issue.      If your not sure what it is, get some additional advice by having      someone with a bit more diagnostic experience look it over for you.        Good Luck with your new truck.
hvrZH2D8aa	So this is a small block ether 350 or 305. maybe 210H.P  The casting number will only help you identify what G.M. built it won't  explain what anyone else (merc or volvo ) put on it.  The motor is in very rough shape but as a mechanic/ auto machinist I see potential.  Good machine shop and finding someone who is good with marine parts will be very helpful in this endeavor. Just let me know how else  I can help you.|`|I7NkFJo2aa	Wow - do you see the massive spark at the back of the alternator in that You Tube post from Richard C. of a 350 GM Volvo-Penta??  I hope its a sealed spark indicator or something other wise - 'boom' sooner or later.    Looks Chev V8 based to me, but that covers Chev, Volvo, Mercury and anyone else that used this very popular base engine.  It looks like a lot of good stuff has been unbolted - I hope it's in a box somewhere.....     The more I look at that photo, the more I get worried.    There is a dodgy raw fibreglass repair along the left edge of the engine bay.  This points to past amateur fix ups, and that my friend points to very bad things.  If the dip stick is that rusty then how bad is the rest of the engine internally?  Even if you do replace the complete cooling system and all the other bits that are missing you have no idea the condition of the engine without a complete tear down.    All my instincts are yelling at me to run away from this one.    It is a money pit, and you will get much better value spending your dollars on something well maintained and ready to go.    On the other hand it may be of personal significance to you, like a relative has left it to you or something, if that is the case then I wish you and your cheque book the very best of luck.|`|LYVTIUvraa	could be a 305/5.0 merc GM motor|`|ecd7b3ecfff2803ec465730724a6d93caa	I am not 100% sure, however if i had to guess i would say a 6 cyl mercrusier, should be a GM block, what type of outdrive is on it, if any?  , look on the side of the block there should be a metal(tin) plate with the engine info, also there should be some numbers that are cast on the block|`|RjUhISEIaa	I've had both Merc's and Volvo engines and I can see both in this but am leaning towards the Merc due to the set up of the cooling system.    Yes, the engine is a major concern but my question surrounds the wood chips that are seen in the picture. Where are they coming from?     Have to agree that you might want to offload this one and find one needing less repair. Course we don't know what the rest of the boat is like so you may be okay but if you get her running don't stray too far from shore.     Honestly, I'd have a marine surveyor go over her to make certain that everything is okay and if not find out what needs to be repaired prior to even beginning to do any repairs.

Can't tell which it is without seeing the exhaust manifold.|`|iTj5NdH1aa	Wow do not listen to the people who say its a V6.    It is a small block GM V8. Could be a 305 or a 350. You can tell its an 8 by the picture because it has 8 wires on the distributor cap.|`|3CA6gZQraa	its definitely a v6 closed cooling engine GM block because distributors in the back the way its painted its a Mercruiser  for the engine size im not sure you can look it up on the intake manifold there should be a number forged into it that will give you the serial number of the engine and you can look it up that way|`|5mCm2XTLaa	Chevy 350 V8 with Holley 650 cfm carb. Pretty common setup. If you look closely you can see it says "Holley" on the front float bowl, you can also see the bolts that hold it on are rusted, good chance carburetor is junk because the metering block's passages are plugged up with corrosion.      Looks like spark plugs, exhaust manifolds and alternator are missing. Missing spark plugs allow salt air and moisture to enter cylinders. Hope the motor isn't seized up, also note the rusty dipstick. Not in the best of shape. Got a lot of work ahead of you.|`|nAzbLdBCaa	It's a Volvo marine AQ 225B, the thermostat housing is the giveaway . It's a lot the worse for ware....In fact it's the worse I've seen.....It looks like it had exhaust pipes "headers"rather than the marine exhaust.  This is a GM block, but a lot of marine parts like forged crank, etc.  The Alt. and starter are marine, even if they look like auto.  This could be a 5.0L but more like a 5.7L   the old "350 cid" it has a marine 4 bbl Rochester carb.  Check out the distributer -8 cly.  The sea water pump is missing.  the key is the stern drive which is outside the hull.  My advise is put your money in something else, It could cost $5000 just to get it running. Sell the drive for parts.....they are bullet proof.  Those wood chips look like seed pods to me.   Check out the web site below!  Regards.|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	Before you accept possession, because that means you have the liability of disposing of it, which is not cheap, I would suggest you ask a surveyor to evaluate restoration costs.  Then look around for what you can get in ready to go condition for the same value.  I think you will find the latter cheaper and much more attractive.  That thing will cost you more in storage while you fix it up than it's worth.
f62f84279f66c27518596919f0d61103aa	Not really.  It depends on how hard up for staffing your facility is and how long it takes them to typically train a new person.  I mean if it takes years to certifiy and everyone is working OT just to keep the show running and you want a transfer to an overstaffed facility in NY the day after you get your CTO, it won't happen.      Just certify, spend a few months to a year in Louisiana past that then start internally applying for a transfer.  Shouldn't be too difficult.      I don't think many places in LA are as in need as facilities in NY, so it should be easy.
b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	You will need to give the blades dimensions and aerodynamics data for a solution. Or more specifically, the lift coefficient. Helicopters dont have standard rotorblades.|`|vGxr9e59aa	As stated, your question doesn't supply enough information for an answer.  In general, for a given blade length, the rotational speed is such that the blade tips stay subsonic (below the speed of sound) throughout the altitude range that the aircraft operates.  Sound travels faster at sea level than at high altitude, and the speed of sound varies with air temperature as well.  One would also need to know how many blades the rotor has, as well as the blade chord and profile.
8AQw9xqBaa	A 94 still has a cap and rotor that would get changed along with the plugs.  If its still got factory wires (they would be numbered) it would also be good to get those changed.  Being a aluminum engine be sure the cooling system gets changed often and the special stop leak tabs get used.  Other than lack of a tune up the most common thing I have seen on those is leaking fuel pressure regulators. The symptom with that is hard starting and poor mileage.   Its not a real expensive part but does require a fair amount of things to be removed to gain access.|`|6CyScIKBaa	spark plugs , fuel filer , pcv not what it use to be some will even scan the engine to

JO3HiGfHaa	They don't match up very well on paper. I am not a fan of the imports but the 350Z is one of the few imports I can live with. It all around manhandles the competition of almost every other car, we don't want to compair it to a Skyline because we all know if we slapped any form of forced induction on the 350Z it would put the Skyline to shame.    2008 350Z:  0-60 in 5.3 seconds  1/4 mile in 13.7 seconds  .91g's on the skidpad    2008 Honda Accord:  0-60 in 6.17 seconds  1/4 mile in 14.6 seconds  .82g's on the skidpad    Handling would clearly go to the rear wheel drive vehicle as the skidpad results show.

e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	More specifics are needed here.  Is the title in your name and you never registered it?  Or you never titled it in PA, and the title is still in the previous owners name?    If the title was in your name and you just lost it, I am not sure if Penndot has a walk in location for individuals.  I know dealers can go to Harrisburg and get a title directly from the state.  Perhaps a title service in your area can get one right away.  It wouldn't hurt to check.  The state charges for a title is 22.50.  If you never titled the vehicle in PA., then the original owner or the persons name who is still on the front of the title has to apply for a duplicate title in the state in which it was titled.|`|S253XERKaa	if you lost the title the last person who own the car will have to file for lost title or other wise the car is worthless that the only way your going to get a title|`|SuZbBnycaa	You bought a car without receiving the title? Or you lost the title?  California rules: In either case, you need to start over with a duplicate title form from the DMV. The form will need the signature of the seller, odometer reading,  and smog certificate. In CA there's no speeding up the process. It takes about 3 weeks to get a new title transfered and mailed to you. But you will walk out the door with a registration with your name on it the day you start the transfer. Registrations are quick. Titles are mailed out.
AA10541300	Blazer,      A 30,000 car that's got 40 or 50,000 miles on it purchased from an individual.      Use yahoo autos to filter on the right one for you in the right area.     Use the advanced filter (the link is in tiny print) to zero in on the type of car, limit the cost to 15k, and limit the years and price so that you don't get all the riff-raff too.  If you click on the columns, you can sort by price.         Also, a toyota would probably be the most reliable.     Here's an example I just did:  http://autos.yahoo.com/used-cars/toyota-...    This is a 31-35,000 car, someone has driven it about 90,000 miles and traded it in to a dealership.   I was looking quick, so I skipped over the mileage, and I grabbed an avalon because it was more than 30k new.  However, I know from experience that if this car were from an individual, and closer to $30k than 35 new,  it would have alot less miles for the price.    Figure out exactly what kind of car you need, (you know what price you can pay), figure out how many miles you can live with, then filter on it every day and wait until you find what you want.   Be optimistic because you'd be surprised what you find.  You'll know it when you see it but don't act to eager or they won't be as willing to bargain.   It's not hard.      Be careful though - remember that you'll be paying 600 bucks for a timing belt when the car has about 60k miles on it - if it hasn't been done yet.  People frequently trade at 60k miles for this reason (they can put the bigger maintenence money towards a newer car) ,but they more frequently drive them another 60 then dump them before they get into 6 digits on the miles.        Also - you'll need to be careful of the obvious things that can be wrong with any used car.   Read the person selling it, make sure you trust them (or walk. nothing wrong with walking away if the car isn't for you. there will be plenty more),  think about near term repairs that you can see coming up,  tire condition, and stuff like that.     Used cars  aren't bad cars, and you can save literally thousands of dollars,  especially if you are willing to chase down some of the repairs yourself.   I've had a 92 turbo supra for 10 years,  I've put almost 100,000 miles on it myself, and since the initial big repair (I bought it with a blown head gasket),  I doubt if I've put more than 3,000 bucks into it this whole time.    I love it, it's classy, it's beautiful, and it's unusual.  It was also cheap when I got it (10k) and has been paid for, for years.  I had 3 strangers offer to buy it last year.  I don't mean to brag, it's still just a car - I'm just saying, don't feel like you have to get a new car.  You won't be giving up much, and to be honest, 15k isn't going to get you much in a new car compared to a used quality one.      My other comment would be - if you have to have a new one, an american made extended cab pickup is going to be much tougher, and will last better, and be easier to work on, more versatile (because of the longer cab.  I will never have a standard cab again), than about anything you can find.  That is one vehicle that you can buy for 15k still and get something that will serve you well.   (base price on a ford ranger ex. cab is 17k, but that's not on sale)    http://autos.yahoo.com/2009_ford_truck_r...    Good luck  Kevin|`|X5F7h3l4aa	if your not on your p-plates id say a R-33 GTS-T Nissan Skyline.    i bought mine for $15,000 exactly.  best car i ever bought but you can get them for cheaper and make sure you dont buy it off a p-plater as it is most likely been thrashed and make sure it was a garaged car.    i got mine off some 30yr old who still lived with his parents (excellent condition)    and also make sure you have some mates with you when you go 2 buy a car cause 1 of my mates went to Sydney with his misses and he told the seller he was really keen and went down there with $10,500 after i told him it wasn't a good idea  to have that amount of cash with him but they went anyway and when they got there he had a look at the car and it was full of rust and when he said no he don't want it  these  guys got real violent with him and threatened to beat him and his misses and because he has no balls he bought the lemon.|`|SbsB0bwEaa	shopping cart

9cLykSGSaa	buy an used engine and rebuild it or buy the compression tool and when you will buy the engine perform the test by yourself|`|g6easyBFaa	200 psi doesn't sound right to me.    Ambient air pressure (1 BAR) is equal to 14.7 PSI at sea level.  With a 10:1 compression ratio that would be roughly 147 PSI under ideal cylinder filling at sea level pressure.    My RX8, for example, also has 10:1 compression and the service manual specs 120 psi @ 250 RPM as normal
Yq2CUhtYaa	You could have done the math yourself, if you weren't lazy.    But given that you are, here you go:    Assume that the hybrid gets 20. The normal one gets 15. Sure, it says 19. You won't see 19. That's best case secenario.    Let's assume you go 10,000 miles in a year, for the sake of simplicity.    That's 500 gallons for hybrid, 667 gallons for the other.    So, assuming a current gas price of around $1.80, you save $300 a year. (900$ for hybrid, 1200 for gas engine)    Given the cost difference between the two of 9,000$....you'd need to own the car for 30 years, before you've started to save anything.    Not that either of these vehicles are any sort of a smart move to start with, if you had bothered to do research. With the current economy, Escalades and other large SUVs are plummeting in value.    You can buy the cheaper at 56k now. In a year, it will be worth $30k. If that somehow makes sense to you to do, go for it. Seems retarded to me.
fl60KL8oaa	If you can find one, a Suzuki 650 Savage.  Looks like a single cylinder Sportster, and Savage owners use a lot of Sportster parts in modifying Savages -- the seat is nearly a bolt on.   It is lightweight with a horridly detuned engine that only produces 30hp so it generally qualifies as a beginner's bike.  Yet that big single has a wide torque curve that has it performing better than larger cruisers.  Tops out at about 85 mph.  There's also a 400 version that was only sold new in Japan.  The bike has been in continuous production since 1986.  Unfortunately I can't see that it has ever been imported to Australia, so they are grey and rather scarce.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	650cc Yamaha.  Looks like the old BSA/Triumph upright twins.  Made gobs of them.  Should be able to pick up a pristine one for U$1000 & they're electric start.  Will that work on the power limits down under?  Yamaha also made a 500cc.  If the limits are smaller, 250cc Honda Rebel.|`|556cc214a7493962346e6f458688b23baa	I like the 250cc Yamaha V Star ( formerly "Virago") for a first bike.  It has the look you want and is not too expensive.  http://www.starmotorcycles.com/star/prod...  In the US, at least,   good, low-mileage used models are not hard to find.|`|WEzv0n0Baa	You don't say what the power limitation is. 2Hp/50Hp.????|`|36ba3084f158ff6094a5acf141b61ec9aa	You don't give the size of bike or your body size so it's sort of hard to give advice with only half the info. But I would not recommend anything smaller than a 500cc unless the law bans it. While a 250cc will run 70mph it will not give you confidence when trying to merge onto an interstate or congested highway. Many people feel that it's best to start with a small bike and move up but I disagree. When you are learning you already know you need to respect the bike and will do so. But once you learn how to drive you gain confidence, this is were the problem comes in. You have gained confidence on a 250cc but now you're sitting on a 500cc with twice the power, your confidence kicks in and you try to ride the 500cc like you rode the 250, that is a recipe for disaster.
dVQdswtTaa	Cummins hands down. We're having a lot of trouble with new Ford powerstrokes.

5jxEyMoPaa	1.clean wheels and arches 2 wash door shuts boot etc and rinse 3 wash car and leather off 4 hoover inside use a paint brush to clean vents 5 clean seats dash board etc with interior cleaner and clean windows inside 6 polish car 7 treat bumpers rub strips plastic door handles with gel or silicone and dress tyres 8 remove car polish when it has had time to bond to paint 9 clean windows out side. few tips!   use soft rubber and a hoover to remove dog hair from seats by rubbing the rubber across the seat it pulls the hairs out, you can use carpet dye on worn carpets to make them look clean and new,and don,t forget to use air freshener in side car to make it smell clean. I use auto glym products, have found them to be one of the best,you don,t have to get them retail as they do supply the trade, another tip after removing polish go round the car with a soft tooth brush and brush out any white polish from around the rubbers cracks etc, make a good job and people will come back|`|U2Nr1rPBaa	Do the best job you can because word of mouth is the best recommendation you can get , and remember people are on hard times so don't over charge !

You can buy clay bar kits for less than $20 at walmart or your local auto parts store.  Use the included spray detailer and spray the area liberally, then rub the clay over it with light pressure.  Use it kinda like an eraser.  This should remove it.  If that doesn't do it, you might want to take it to a detailer.  They can buff it out and probably make the whole car look 100% better while they are at it.

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	Your stereo is a fake. Rockford does not make head units. Your car may have a Rockford speaker system and therefore they may have put the Rockford emblem on the stereo but the stereo itself is not made by Rockford. Replacing it with an ipod ready unit will give you much better quality and control for your ipod than using an FM modulated adapter.|`|6DQ8LzxFaa	Actually, Rockford Fosgate did make head units, for a few years in the early 2000s. I had two different ones. They were good units. I wish I still had them. They had 4V pre outs, remote control (useless to me), and played MP3s.   To the OP, if it is working good, why change it? If you just want to play an I-Pod thru it, I would just get the FM transmitter thing, if it sounds good. I burn my own CDs with MP3 to play in my truck.

I know the engines and the years aren't comparable, but the coolant temperature sensor was causing me the exact same problem.  I don't know much about GM's 4.3L and Saturn's are notorious for this sensor going bad so I don't know if my answer applies at all, but it may be worth looking into.|`|39bCq7ncaa	check your battery connections, this happened to me and all I had to do was clean off the battery terminals and tighten the cables back on|`|jPOtfICyaa	Could be the battery if you hear the starter clicking every time you start it. But if you don't hear the starter clicking it could be the starter. You can get the starter checked at Auto Zone. They will tell you if it's going bad or if it's dead. Check to see how the voltage looks on your dash. If it's low it could be your alternator going bad. If your alternator goes out, it will die your battery out. Again Auto Zone can check that for you.    I hope this helps!!!!
