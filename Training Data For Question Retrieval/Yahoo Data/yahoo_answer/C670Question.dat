Even when i wear shorts i am really careful about them not being short.I never wear mini skirts, but i am 5'7'', 110 Ib, curvy, and a 32C. So she tells me i always look slutty, but i can't control my physical looks.      How do I explain this to her?

20090307150425AAJ0g5q	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do when my grandpa holds my grandma back from going and doing things?	My grandma divorced her original husband years ag. My other grandpa (not my real one) seems as if he holds her back from going and doing. For instance, I have a band concert tonight and I called and see if she wanted to go. She said, "Oh, Pee Paw just got back from a rod run. He's not in the best of moods. You know how that goes."      I said, "No I don't."      She said sorry and I accepted her apology but this is not the only time this has happened. I just wish sometime that my grandpa would not hold her back. I told her we could pick her up and she could go with us but she said she didn't feel like doing this...      Maybe it's her...maybe she's turning back on her own. This has not been the only time. There have been several other occasions.      Can someone help?

20090307151124AAWY1dq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Attraction through Accusations?	I have been dating my current girlfriend for nearly two years and we have been through good times and bad. I can say in all honestly that I have been completely faithful and never wished to be with any one else, even when we fought. Or that is how it used to be.      Her parents divorced due to her father having an affair with another women and I think that this really scarred her. She accused me a month or two ago about possibly being interested in another woman and it completely surprised me. She through a list of people at me who she knew were more than willing to go out with me and I honestly did not know about these other girls feelings, I had no reason to look for if they liked me more than in a friendly way. I am terrible with being able to tell when someone is flirting with me.      But one of the girls I had met only this year and had an open period with her and a few other of my friends at school. She is a little younger than me, very pretty, interesting and enjoyable to talk with (and I see now that she had/does flirt with me) but I had only thought of her as a friend, nothing more. But after my girlfriend pointed out that she liked me I have suddenly found myself attracted to her. This literally makes me disgusted with my self for I had not ever wanted to think these things. I am still dating the girl who told me these things and we are currently at a state in our relationship where we are either great or terrible but she still means a lot to me.      What I'm trying to ask is what do I do? I care very much for the person that I am dating and even if we can not work this out I would like to be friends with her. I am NOT going to leave her for another girl and I even find myself distancing myself from this other girl. This attraction is making things difficult on myself and her, though I have not admitted it. Am I drawn to her just because of this accusation?      What is the best thing for me to do now?

20090307152318AATo7hC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does a good personality in a woman mean to a man?	a 30 year old, self confident, well to do, professional, very attractive woman. She is fun loving, but, being an Indian , she doesn't know everything about the english culture.   She is smart, has got her own opinion on different things. She respects all people and is genuinely caring. Also, she is honest, and straight forward. She is very romantic and can make a man weak in his knees with her hot looks.   but, being indian, she doesn't share the same sense of humor as british men, she may not know all the latest songs, or movies etc.   busy professional, never got exposure into a few things.      do you think this is good personality?

20090307152327AA98aFw	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I in the wrong?(Kinda long)?	Ok...Tonight one of my friends is having her "sexy 17" birthday party of course I was invited and I asked what I thought was my best friend to come with me to the party because I didn't feel comfortable going alone.She originally told me she would come.Until today 2 hours before the party was to begin she tells me she can’t go.Why?Because her “Fxck Buddy” had planned to come and pay her a visit,therefore she had to be home for him to come over.BTW we are both 16.I am constantly doing stuff for this girl that I thought was my best friend.I am always there for her.Her mother is an alcoholic,so she proceeds to call me when she is scared to be in her home alone.I am there no matter what,even if I have a paper due the next day,even if I’m having problems of my own,even when I am feeling sick.When she was sick I cooked her favorite meal for her and brought it to her house.When she had no money to buy groceries because her mom had spent it on booze I convinced my mom to buy groceries for them.She is constantly calling me early in the morning on weekends to go places with her,I drag my a_s_s out of bed and go.I could go on for days telling you everything I’ve done for her and she can’t do this one thing for me?Am I wrong for thinking this is messed up?

20090307152259AAea2Aw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he only trying to get in my pants, or does he like me. (Bit lengthy) Thanks!?	Ok, so there's this guy that I hang out with in my group of friends. We all hang out because we are all in speech. So whenever I see him, he makes all these sexual jokes like he wants to screw me, he loves me, ect.. I'm kind of known as the flirt in the group, but I don't have a boyfriend. I'm kind of the boyish girl in the group. But I definetly don't dress boyish, just act like some of the guys. So, he and I get along great, but he is in a little bit of the popular crowd at school, and I'm just average. He acts different around some people. Like at school he doesn't really flirt with me as much as he does outside of school. But like last night, I had onions for dinner (I know I'm an ***) and he was like your breath smells bad, and he and I kind of banter back and forth. He also sometimes touches me like he like put his arm around me for like 1 minutes last night and was like massaging my shoulder, and like always steps on my heels in a joking way. Only 1 person I know says he likes me, because no one knows I like him, and I don't ask.I have no idea if I'm pretty or not, some of my girlfriends say I'm gorgoes, but then again they are friends. Haha so only a couple of guys and like adults and my friends say I'm pretty. He's a but of a flirt too, and it's wierd because right when he and I got tight, his gf and him broke up. I'm like outgoing and so is he. So what do you think, do you think he likes me? By the way we are both in high school. But we are like kind of hot and cold. . And like IDK because he seems to flirt with other girls too. And he always comments on other girls. So..do you think he likes me? And this morning he texted me, but he also texted my other friend. Is he leading me on, or does he like me? People always also say we should date because we are so similar?

She also said she woz proud of me for havin the courage to ask and that we would maybe talk about it in a while. So my question is should i wait for her to make the next move or just move on and  forget about it completely?
20090307152354AAP23jK	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Engaged at 17, Married at 23, thoughts?	Hey I'd really like some insight (even though y'all are complete strangers as far as I know) into the situation I'm in at the moment.      Just FYI: The legal age to get married without parental consent is 18 in this country I am in, and I am a Christian so living together before marraige (or even having sex before marriage) is NOT an option.         Also I'd like to define love (as much as anybody can) as always putting the other persons needs above your own, and growing to be incrediably close with them so that you cannot imagine life without them.         I met my "boyfriend" 14 months ago, when i started highschool in the public school system. (before that I had been schooled privately) We became good friends, then "fell in love" y'know, the whole butterfly stomach, tingling, stay awake til two in the morning playing lovesongs type.          We both acknowledge that we were romantically interested in each other, but because of our wanting to do well in school and my parents caution about me dating, we decided to put any realtionship on hiatus.         Yeah, it didn't work. Out of the puupy love (which i knew even then it was) grew a genuine love realtionship (and we both still managed to keep our grades up!).       I love him, I would be willing to compromise for him, have his babies (two a clock feeds etc, i had a big family back home), be his best friend and lover. He feels the same way (minus the actual carrying the baby part :P)       We come from two different upbringings, (for instance, he is the only christian in his family, his parents are immigrants etc), and we both recognize that, but we have spent a lot of time working through various issues (and we will continue to do so I am sure).       We both want to be teachers, and will be going to different universities in eight months (though only two hours away) as we both want to teach in radically different subjects.       I know that if I married him before or during university that my grades would slip dramatically, and he acknowledges that, so we are prepared to wait til after we graduate. we have a great open realtionship and talk about EVERYTHING.         So as you might have guessed, we both independantly came to the conclusion that we wanted to get married, and although we wont right away, we both would love to make a step forward by getting engaged at the end of this year (before we start university)         I would honestly like your opinions on this, I know there are some scary statistics out there, but also some really awesome stories.      Thank you so much for reading this
20090307152544AAX3xi7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would you consider this cocky?	My boyfriend is pretty much a good guy.. however he almost lives at the gym (works out 2 hours a day, 6 days a week!), constantly eating protein bars, wearing tight, tight shirts ALWAYS.. well he makes me kiss his biceps every 5 minutes.. he calls me in the middle of the night to tell me he can't count all the packs on his stomach... whenever we are in a serious argument he flexes his pecs and says "look my chest is telling u to shut ur face haha!"... He will MAKE me wait if I want sex because he just worked out and his muscles need recovery... if I try to talk to him while he's playing "MLB the show" or whatever he tells me to "go gag urself for like an hour".. he's 24 years old... now he's in NO way violent or curses me out or anything but I just wanted to see if everyone else thought this was cocky?

I'm an only child who wants someone to treat at a big sister and I want to know them in person. I'm eleven years old. I do NOT want to join one of those programs with the big sis-little sis because my parents would just feel guilty that they didn't give me a real sibling. I LOVE my parents, but you know, I can't tell them EVERYTHING. I also don't wanna tell a stranger my secrets. But I don't have any siblings, cousins that are older than me, aunts that are young, or friends with older sisters, or neighbors. Next year is middle school! Since grades wont have joint classes, do you think I'll meet any 7th graders? I mean, I'm in a school with K-5 graders and don't know them. Then again, we don't switch classes. Anyway, how can you tell if a person is outgoing, shy etc. from just peering at them across the hall? How should I introduce myself? Will she treat me like a 7th grader, or a baby, or sister, or what?      Thank you very much to all answerers!!!!

20090307153553AAzygJm	Family & Relationships;Family	I HATE MY SISTER SO MUCH I WANNA KILL HER HELP ME PLEASE!?	I'm sorry! I know that sounds really bad, but honestly I have never hated anyone so much in my life! She is 14 and I am 16, and is already a self-centered, stuck up, violent, shallow, rude little *****! Okay, so I have some problems, like I have depression and Social Anxiety which she really does not understand, and she always makes fun of me and calls me a bad role model to my whole family.          She always says things like,"when I go to high school I am gonna make so much friends and not be shy like you, and I won't hang out with ugly people like your friends." GRRR... She always calls me fat and says that I overeat and stuff, and laughs at me when i feel like killing myself. She never shares anything with me, every time I have something I always share it with her no problem, and I never have a problem with her borrowing my clothes and stuff, but when I just borrow like a shirt of hers or ask for something, she blows a gasket and complains about me and says the worst things about me! Like today for instance, my dad said he would buy a desk for us, and she says that she asked for one first, (we share the same room, with our other sister) so I said it doesn't matter because we both need one and our room is really small, and she got so pissed off and said, no we are not sharing. She is scared of my other older brothers and sisters but when it comes to me she treats me like **** and thinks she has power over me.          She yells at me even when I tell her she looks pretty, she gets mad. When I play a song I like, she rolls her eyes and gets mad, when I leave just one piece of clothing on the bathroom floor she complains the entire day about it!! It is really hard to change and she just doesn't understand. I just can't seem to make her happy, because everything I say is a problem. Even if I just wave to her on the street or something, she gets embarrased by me. She always says she hates me with a passion and I don't know why. Instead of helping me, she just thinks about herself and looks in the mirror all the time and brings up the past with me. I really hate myself because of her. And like twenty minutes ago she pushed all of my drawing supplies on the floor and I got so mad I punched her on the back! I can't seem to control my anger. I swear to God I feel like killing her and me, you have no idea, its not normal, help!!

20090307153935AAIrxit	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should Civil Marriage Be Required?	In several countries (e.g. France), a couple desiring to marry must participate in a civil ceremony first.  Thereafter, they may get married in a religious ceremony.  In these countries, the religious official may not perform the wedding ceremony unless the couple presents him with a civil marriage certificate.  Do you think this would be a good idea in the United States?  Why or why not?      I do not see any First Amendment issues, because the state is free to set the requirements for marriage, and need not defer to the determination of a religious organization.  I would like to know what people think about requiring all couples to go through a civil ceremony first, to be followed by religious ceremony if they desire.

20090307153548AAggJ4V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls only please........?	Girls, say if you knew that 5 boys that like you, and you like the attention that a boy gives, you would you try to lead them all on, or just one. I guessing all, but if one why, and why that one?      I'm asking because I think a girl likes me but she might be leading me on but she also know that other boy like her but it seems she is just focusing on me.  My logic to this is:       "IF she is leading me on she must like attention from boys, so she will want as much attention she could get, so she would be doing the things that she is doing to me to the other boys, so she can get attention from them"          but she only dose the things to me, in fact she treats me different and the things she do would suggest she likes me.      P.S. It is a little...well a lot more than this so, if you think you can help me, and you want to you can email me and I can give you more info.

20090307154744AAt5OxT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Stuck between friends. ugh!?	For the story I will use S, J, & E as my friends names.   At the beginning of the school year, S & J were really close best friends.    I had already known E, and we became really good friends with S & J.    S & E got mad at J when she said they were uncool and she had friends better than them, and that she wanted to switch classes to be with them. S & E told me to stay out of the fight so I did. They are still fighting and basically they are not friends with J anymore, but I still want to be friends with her. I have hung out with J alone, and S & E, but it feels awkward and I feel like we had more fun when it was all four of us.   What should I do?

20090307154932AAkxO9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WTF is she thinking??	Ok...Tonight one of my friends is having her "sexy 17" birthday party of course I was invited and I asked what I thought was my best friend to come with me to the party because I didn't feel comfortable going alone.She originally told me she would come.Until today 2 hours before the party was to begin she tells me she can’t go.Why?Because her “Fxck Buddy” had planned to come and pay her a visit,therefore she had to be home for him to come over.BTW we are both 16.I am constantly doing stuff for this girl that I thought was my best friend.I am always there for her.Her mother is an alcoholic,so she proceeds to call me when she is scared to be in her home alone.I am there no matter what,even if I have a paper due the next day,even if I’m having problems of my own,even when I am feeling sick.When she was sick I cooked her favorite meal for her and brought it to her house.When she had no money to buy groceries because her mom had spent it on booze I convinced my mom to buy groceries for them.She is constantly calling me early in the morning on weekends to go places with her,I drag my a_s_s out of bed and go.I could go on for days telling you everything I’ve done for her and she can’t do this one thing for me?Am I wrong for thinking this is messed up?

20090307154557AANIGA3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Middle school guy help!?	i *really* like this guy, and ive liked him for 2 years now. but almost *every* girl that has at least a class with him likes him too! even two of my best friends, and then a lot of other school friends!! i have block with him (3 periods) and so do my friends that like him. i am really quiet in class, like i like...never raise my hand or volunteer for anything, so people usually categorize me as shy or quiet and dont really notice me. but my friends are *really* outgoing! everyone notices them, and one of my best friends like *always* flirts and laughs with him! its hard, because my friends like him (not nearly as much as i do) and just take over. they have a much better chance of attracting guys, like the one we like...   in the beginning of the school year, (im in 7th grade), of course i looked at him a lot, ya know. and practically every time i looked, he was also looking, and one time he smiled at me! or sometimes i was just glancing at him and he also glanced at me! he looked at me *a lot* then. but now, he doesnt really do the same. well its kinda hard anyway to know, cuz he sits behind me, so it'd be weird if i looked behind me a lot. so i dont really know if he still looks at me. actually, i see him looking at my friend a good amount of times, and laughing with her, and just walking up to her and talking to her! its *sooooo* annoying!! im *really* confused right now especially since he really likes this other girl from last year who i dont know that well. but it *is* most definitely possible for a guy to like more than one girl, in fact, its really likely! i dont really think he notices me really, and he doesnt ever talk to me, i dont talk to him, and yeah. do u think he likes me? probably not. the bigger question is: how do i get him to notice me and like me more than my friends??

20090307075947AANsowb	Family & Relationships;Family	Economically helping mom. Brother won't . What would you do?	My mom just recently began getting income from social security, but  its not enough to get by.  My husband and I have given her a monthly amount to help her out since I got married 12 years ago (excluding two years when my husband was earning minimum and we had two children).  Recently, my mom told me my only brother, who used to give her a monthly amount stopped helping her about a year ago. I feel this is not right, that he should help her as well.  He has a job, earns almost as much as my husband, has one less child than we do (I can't find reasons for him not  tp help mom).  I wouldn't have this question if my husband and I could help her out with more money, but since we can't, would you tell your brother to help mom, or would you leave things as they are and hope that he will become aware of her economical needs in the near future? and if you do tell him, how would address the issue graciously? Thank you for all your answers!

20090307153407AABLMja	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marrying someone who isn't a Christian . . .?	After I'm done with grad school I'll probably marry my boyfriend, who isn't a Christian, but I am. I want to hear from the experiences of people who are in a "mixed marriage" and particularly how you dealt with a hostile church and/or Christian friends if you experienced this. I'm not looking for people to quote the "do not be unequally yoked"; or for every random Christian to spout their opinion about it. I am specifically asking for people in a marriage with someone who isn't a Christian. I've got friends who have already hashed over everything you could tell me, so I don't need to hear it from random strangers. I've come here, because even though all my Christian friends say I would have a horrible marriage, none of them seem to actually know anyone who is married to a non-Christian. Anyway, any comments from the targeted group would be appreciated, and comments outside of that group will be met with open hostility. Thanks for respecting me.

We used to go out eating, shopping or browsing. Going places and seeing things together and now she doesn't want to do anything like that anymore.I was always going to her place but she wouldn't come to my house and then she would just not answer her phone, said she didn't want to use her cellphone minutes up to call on the home phone and when I would do that she wouldn't answer. Now she is busy doing things with her son and his girlfriend and so when she started backing off from talking to me I started getting busy with other things such as getting involved in getting a union organized at my old place of employment and doing things for myself before I met her. She calls me like once every few days and says she will call me back and then doesn't, I get the feeling she does not want to be friends any longer. What do you think?

20090307154325AAlFJ0h	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I doing the right thing about my husband's ex-girlfriend?	Okay. Here's the situation. My husband recently started being friends with is ex-girlfriend. In the beginning she was so nice to me. Even tried to be friends. I was okay with it but I was standoffish. Something told me not to trust her. She tried getting into our marital business and acted like she wanted to support me through it. I had a feeling it was fake. Well she comes up with all these lies and things that she tells my hubby to make herself more appealing. He got sick of it and called her out on it. And ever since then, the nice girl personality has disappeared and her true colors are coming out.             Well she started talking to my hubbies' little sister about our marital problems. I told his sister that it wasn't her place to be discussing that with her and now she is mad at his ex for telling. She sent my hubby a message saying that she's pissed at the ***** he calls his wife. Then she sent me an email through myspace saying that his sister is just a little girl for Christ's sake and I should leave her out of it. All I told her was that she is not to discuss things about our marriage to other people. I told her nicely but sternly so she could get the point that this is serious. I haven't said anything to his sister since. I didn't feel like that was too much to ask.            Well she's pressing my buttons. And a part of me says be the better person and ignore it. But another part of me gets so ticked off I wanna tell her how it is. And through all this I have never asked him not to be friends with her. She has a part of his past, not pertaining to their relationship, but to something tragic that happened to him, that I will never have. But this is getting out of hand. What should I do? Be the better person and ignore it? I have a feeling that will tick her off more. Or tell her off?

20090307154425AASeJVB	Family & Relationships;Friends	How Do I Save My Friendship?	I recently did something really terrible and violated my friends' trust in me. We had an intense talk about it and she forgave me, there were tears, and I said I would never do anything to hurt her like that again and that we both love each other very much. She said, "i know you, and your family, and you're still my friend." We've been through a lot. And basically it happened as a result of associating with certain people.       I told her I would never do anything to jeopardize our friendship like that again. And this week, one of my friends from that group, the one who's always been a good guy and looked out for me is having a birthday at a club this weekend. I said I'd go but plan to go with another group of friends I can count on. I called my best friend and left a message yesterday saying my friend having the birthday is wondering if she and her boyfriend wanted to come.       She hasn't called me back and I've called her three times in the past three days. I don't want to lose her as a friend! Do you think she's mad? Will she forgive me?

In my experience I have rarely seen a girl who would actually consider approaching a guy she was interested in. What's up wit dat lol? Are you too timid or shy or afraid of rejection, or are you just trying to gain the upper hand in the 'game' by having them approach you first so you can pass judgment on them?

20070623023028AAktEMu	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you tell the common friend the truth or pretend like everything's just alright?	you have a misunderstanding of some sort with someone. you ask through sms if he/she is angry with you & apologized for whatever you've done. but all you got is silence. taking his/her silence as "yes i'm angry at you," you stay away from the person ... but, then, you come across a common friend and got together a bit. common friend brought up the person you're staying away from and trying to forget ... would you admit to the common friend the truth (and maybe pour out)? or, would you just pretend like everything's alright?
20070613001714AAhOaMI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long should you wait to call a girl after she gives you her number?	I met this girl a while ago, but tonight I finally spent time talking with her. Her name is 'S' and she's a friend of a friend, so it was easy to get to talk to her. Tonight we played Pub trivia, then sat and talked till 145am. Her friend left around 12, and asked if I would give her a ride. I said, sure if it was alright with 'S'. I then ''casually'' looked away, as if to order another drink and I could see them having a mental conversation with my periferal vision. She said that would be great, if I didn't mind. So, we spend the rest of the night talking and joking and such, and I give her a ride home. I wasn't sure of the area, so I joked that I'd probably be calling her to ask her how I was suppose to get home. We got to her place and she got out. She gave me her number, 'incase I got lost.' I asked if she'd want to come out again with me. She smiled and yelled call me as she skipped away. I thought about calling then, but didn't. WHEN SHOULD I CALL HER AND ASK HER OUT??

20090307120400AAdKGgS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Difficulties with husband?	Every weekend my husband flips out completely. This is a recent occurrence (within the last 6 weeks). He is abusive, furious  and says things he would never say while in his right mind.      He has an appt with a psychiatrist Monday. I am almost completely convinced that it's a mental problem. I am unwilling to leave him until that has been ruled out,      However, It is intolerable in the meantime. He is so abusive, and it's not my nature to accept abuse. I almost left last night, but it's embarrassing to prevail upon my mom.      It's impossible to calm him, and I am 100% sick of this, even if it is a mental illness.      Any advice? I' m completely fed up.

If was in this situation....do I have any rights ?  My kids father has warrant and I'm being harassed by the police. The only time I dealt with him was for money for the kids 6mos ago. I told the the police I don't know where he is.The police came here because this is the last known address he used. The very last when I spoke to my kids father he told me he needed to use my address so he can get a job and they needed an address to contact him and also for child support.      I even went down to the post office like one of the officers told me to do and have his name remove from my mailing address, to prevent them from coming back here.But obviously that did not work. I don't want to jeopardize my apartment, I am under section 8 and the police said that they will report me if I didn't tell them where he is . When they were here this morning they barge they way in while I was even dressed without even showing me a search warrant ,asking my 7 and 8yr old questions about their father. I don't know what to do anymore this has be going on for a year now and I don't want to loose my home and children this is all I have. The police said they will keep coming back and they will break down my door if I don't open it and if I'm not home. They have broken my door in the past as well while I was taking a shower. I already been homeless before for nearly 3yrs what can I do? Please help, do I have any rights at all ?

He is my only relative and I look after him well so I decided to treat him to a short break.      The real reason I sent him away is that I am after one of his lady friends. Not for keeps – just for one night. He normally doesn’t bother if anyone else sleeps with his girlfriends as his attitude to life is that he doesn’t ‘own’ them and they are free do so as they like.      I am just wondering if the fact that I am his uncle might not go down so well – I don’t know, because we have never been in this situation before. Shall I keep it a secret from him when he returns or would it be best to tell him?

20090227073635AADxQK0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she a gold digger?	I met a woman who I contacted through Match.com, and we had dinner together at a restaurant.  We talked a lot and agreed to meet again.  But then I felt a red flag pop up after we parted.   During the conversation, I noticed she had a lot of money problems.  She has a roommate, and a menial job at a camera shop.  I have no problem with that.  I work at an astrophysics lab.  That's not at issue for me.  What really got me was how she had no trouble hinting at me buying her gifts.  I mean: WE JUST MET!  For instance, she mentioned her having once played violin.  I said, you should continue to do that, since I love music, and playing music.  After replying that she had no violin, she said, if I wanted to contribute to her having a new violin, it would be fine.  I laughed, because that would be a fitting response, and she got all quiet, like--does she really expect me to be pledging to buy her a violin two hours into the relationship?   Should I move on to the next ad?

20090307113201AAIirX1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How would you handle a problem like this with your husband?	Yesterday I placed my step-dad into a nursing home.  It broke my heart, but due to his physical and mental condition, it was the only thing we could do.  His doctors all recommended this.        I was home about 20 minutes after getting back from the nursing home, and my husband's best friend, who enjoys saying insulting and humiliating things to me (which amuses my husband), asked me what I was up to.  I explained that I was just home from placing dad into a nursing home.  He started giving me the third degree, asking if this was my step-dad's decision, why would we do this to him, how can you do this to someone you love, etc.  I was polite enough to explain all the reasons, but after I got off the phone I felt worse than ever.  I told my husband that I really didn't need to be badgered by this person at that time, and my husband's response was, as usual, to laugh at the fact that this friend managed to "get at me" once again.      Is it normal for men to stand up for their friends to this extent?  I know that there is the male-bonding thing, but does it even go beyond giving support to the wife?  I would love to not answer the phone when this person calls, but my husband refuses to answer the phone and always orders me to pick it up, so I'm stuck listening to this jerk everytime and just taking whatever he decides to dish out.

I was really good friends with a guy, i understand that he only stuck around because he wanted to date me. but after about a year of our "friendship" which i guess i valued too much he got a girlfriend and kicked me to the curb. he hasent talked to me, looked at me or even acknowleged my presence for the last two years. i dont understand how we can go from being bestfriends (or so i thought) one day and mere strangers the next.       im not mad at the guy, if he said that he was sorry i would forgive him in a heartbeat. but the thing is it still hurts as bad as it did two years ago. for some reason i just cant let go of the guy.       i need forget about him. but how? even if i have to hate him i dont care i just dont want to let myself get hurt anymore over him

ANYWAYS....      I've been married for almost 2 years now...and I have a 10 mth old daughter...and I'm having problems with my inlaws. My husband is no mama's boy...but he is an only child. In our future I want to move away from the place we currently live in and go to a bigger and better place. But he wants to stay near his parents forever...because "they're alone". I feel that we're young...and so are his parents...and we should go for our dreams and live our lives before we have to take care of his parents when they're old and retired. I know that sacrifices are a part of marriage....because I've already sacrificed a lot and so has he for each other and our daughter.....I don't feel that I need to sacrifice more of  my dreams for HIS PARENTS too. It was their decision to have one child....did they think he was going to be with them forever? I feel that they had their chance at living their lives......we should be entitled to our chance.....without my husband feeling guilty or sh*t making me suffer for his parents.....whom I don't really like in the first place because I've had to deal with their sh*t for 2 years and going....and now even his mom's face and voice annoys the hell outta me...but whatever I've gotten this way for keeping everything in all this time....but whatever.       Please help me to understand...I mean am I being too selfish or insensitive.....a cold heartless b*tch? Tell me anything!??!?! maybe I can get it through my head one way or the other....I don't know....UGH

20090227070054AADy5rn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Take a chance or not worth it?	I always have a hard time trying to like guy and such (in the bf way) and I was wondering if it would be better to give someone a chance, and see if it works out, even if it only lasts three weeks, or if it's better to just keep waiting until I can find someone who I'm really interested in (even if that's not until college).   There are two guys I could give a chance to right now, and one goes to a different school, the other one rarely talks to me even if given the chance but I know he likes me. He just only shows it when we're alone...not that he's mean, he's just shy I guess.   And the other guy isn't sure he can try anything b/c his best friend likes me as well and is still trying to get over me.   So what is the best plan of action here?   Fanks for help =]

Every time I talk to my ex about our 11yr daughter he says oh well I have to ask Lauren if we could do that she knows better. I did not have the kid with his wife, so why do I have to be asking other woman for money?

20090227072238AA4Tzd8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please read! i think he pretended to like me?	this guy acted like he liked me but he really didnt . started off as friends and then began to like eachother (im 18 btw) this 'thing' we had had been going on for over a year now. everytime we see eachother (which isnt very often) he wants to be with me. but nothing would ever happen after that, like going out. he wouldnt even call. thats why its confusing coz he would act like he really likes me one minute then he wouldnt.we recently kissed, and i thought things would change, but he didnt contact me after 2 weeks, until on msn and i told him to leave me alone. he msgd me and said why i was so angry so i told him everything and how upset he has made me feel and why he isnt doung anything about it. and he said sorry i didnt realise it and then goes "i think your pretty cool and i like talking to you" . why would he say I THINK YOUR COOL, WTF! i feel used. that clearly says he doesnt like me.   he knows im not the type to go around and kiss everyguy i see, so he should know that the kiss meant something to me.   he acted like he liked me this whole time and ive wasted a whole year for him. :( i feel like an idiot and im so embarassed. the thing is that hes only kissed like 3 girls and is still a virgin (hes 19), so he isnt a player. maybe hes just rude. i dont want to talk to him, but im still curious.   any thoughts??

20090307112531AA3WWCd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Playing games or she like me?	We do get along alot and are have very similar personalities.She often refers us like to old married couples.We do flirt,argue and  then make up alot when together and email.She always wants to know what his going on in my life and now started telling me whats happening in hers.She does get jealous i feel when i am talking to another girl in the office and says that i or the other lady fancies me. It seems to me she always wants to be close to me and often comes and stands by me or walk together in the office.We did dance together holding hands at the christmas party but i left early. She also asked me to come to another party two weeks ago but i refused.I told her i would be on my own she said so what.She keeps asking me to buy chocolates for her and tea from the vend machine She finds me really funny and once i sticked a parking ticket on her car with a message which she found really funny. I thought she go mad.She does not act like this with anyone else in the company. Also i once told her that i liked her she replied saying good.Alot of other things had happen but to much to write.This is going on for a while but i have always stopped myself doing anything with her because we are both married. She does flirt with other people in the office which i told her but she replied its alot different with you. Do you thinks she his just playing games and i am jumping to conclusion or there could be more to it.Going on for two years but been more obvious for the last 6 month were i having become less hot headed and looking smarter  which she has also referred to.

I have a house phone if I need to call anyone during the day. =)   (I've thought about this ALOT)         I play basketball practically all year around.

PLEASE ANSWER?	so my friend (close friend) likes like 4-5 guys in our grade and shes a huge flirt. and i used to like 2 guys in our grade but now i like someone new and just that person. and once i told her like 2 days later, she tells me- well i've liked him since 4th grade, people just forgot because i started liking other people too, but i never really stopped liking him. and that kinda bothered me cause she just randomly tells me that when i like him. what do you think about that?       and she was a crazy flirt for that whole week and then finally she said she'd stop, but i dont think she will. and i cant really flirt like she does, cause ha well i suck at it. so he flirts back with her......

20090307113424AAJyeeK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need input and advice please!?	My ex of 4yrs has been texting me recently saying stuff like i drove past yr house, i miss you, n that he was near my work the other day when he should of been at college so i replyed 2 him saying he needs 2 sort his head out etc, ive asked him back in the past but he dont give me an answer (we broke up due 2 an arguement and have been apart for 2 months now) after i said he should sort himself out he text saying that he was seriously thinking about us getting back 2gether but when he was gettin2 the point of saying yes to being with me i would go off on one, (i assume me tellin him 2 sort himself out was going off on one!)  he was contacting me everyday for the past week but since he has said this i aint heard from him.

There is a birthday party im invited to and my girlfriend isn't.   we haven't been dating long only a week and a couple days.I've been friends with the girl having the party for awhile.my girlfriend and the girl having the party aren't friends. there will be dancing and other stuff. Should i not dance with any other girls because i have a girlfriend or should i talk to her and see if she is ok with it. I dont want to hurt her feelings, and i want to go to the party but i don't want to go to the party and just stand around. i think it would be kinda awkward for my girlfriend because she and the girl having the the party don't ever talk or anything so i think it would kinda be awkward for her to come and i don't feel its my place to be asking if i can bring people to her party. Need some advice on this one.
20090307113811AA2L2kB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do I Tell Him Whats Going On?	So I hang out with a lot of the same kids all of the time. All of us are pretty good friends. Last year, one girl in the group had a crush on another guy in it & he knew and never did anything and didnt talk to her about it ever, it kinda broke her heart actually...she's over him now though, but he still gets weird when someone mentions how she used to like him.   Anyway, I found I have a crush on this kid in our group, there is nothing positive about him, he's a jerk, & likes to make people feel awkward. He's not even cute! For some reason I'm completely attracted to him. Should I do what my other friend did and keep it to myself & never tell him, just let him eventually figure it out or should I just stop being a wuss and tell him what's been going on in my mind. I dont want to kill our friendship! What do i do? I dont want it to be awkward...
20090307115738AA1TOoF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is This Normal To Anyone?	Okay, so me & my ex-boyfriend Mark have a lot of the same friends so we have to be around each other a lot.    He asked me out, but during that time we were dating, he never showed that he liked me when I was around him, & our friends would have to like pressure him into doing something because he is such an awkward kid. But then when I wasnt there, he told almost all of our friends he would go to third base with me. I mean seriously, whats up with that? Anyway, after I broke up with him I really cant stand him, I find myself mad at him constantly and sometimes I just want to tape his mouth shut & make him stop being so freaking annoying. I would really love to be his friend, but everything was fine before we dated. Now I dont like him sometimes & our friends have even mentioned it to me before. Like saying "Do you really hate Mark?" so what i want to know is: is it normal to really not like your ex? what can i do so i dont want to hit him every time i see him?

20090307115000AA6lUvN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can my friend′s ex and new husband have adopted his son without his consent?	My buddy has a complicated situation. Him and his ex divorced in 1996 after being separated for well over a year. She kept moving and hid his son from him. He hasn′t and still doesn′t know where they are except that they are somewhere in michigan. He started using drugs years ago (has long since stopped been remarried and is in college) and got into some trouble with the law. Got out of jail and moved to Brazil but in violation of probation. He has two children with his new wife so in fear of having to deal with a 1996 probation violation, he never went back to the States. However, his parents have looked for her and her parents won′t give up information. Her dad showed his dad a picture of his grandson and she kept her kids away from even her parents for two years because of it. She is unstable but gets by. She wrongly accused him of abuse (we all know him very well) but only years after they divorced and she took advantage of his legal status in court. He hasn′t paid child support but has always been willing to. Can he legally find her? Can she have taken his son away from him? She has always known where he has been and especially where his parents are. What can he do?

20090227072515AAsXYRb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My relationship issues.?	My boyfriend and I got into an argument last night and I found out that he believes relationships don't take work.  He is older than me and has dated more than me and has a track record of only lasting 3 years with women.  I want to get married and we are coming up to our two year mark.  I don't understand how he could think relationships don't take work, like as in you don't have to work at it.  So when he would hit a bump in the road or a ruff patch he would just bail with all the other ones.  He thinks relationships should just naturally flow if your meant to be together.  I think even the best of relationships still take work and that's how they are still together to this day because they work at it.  I tried to explain to him that a relationship was like a plant if you don't feed and water that plant it would die and the same with a relationship if you don't work at a relationship and help it along it would die.  So am I wrong here?  Is there any way to show he him he is wrong here and his pattern in relationship thinking isn't working.  I love him and I don't want this to affect us.  Also does anyone recommend any good relationship books for him to read that explains how relationships need to be worked on and that's ok?

Every time I go to talk to him I am always afraid I will say something stupid, so if anyone has any good conversation starters that would be great. :)  Anyway, I thought that if I knew what he thought of me it might make me calm down a bit.  So I asked my friend to ask him what he thought of me because he will usually answer any question no matter how weird.  But instead of answering her he didn't say anything.  He just got up and went over to talk to some of his friends.  What does that mean.  By the way Im in 8th grade (just because i missed the cut off date) and he is in 9th grade.  He is turning 15 on the first saturday of march and I turn 15 on the 22 of June.  And he does not have a girlfriend.

Last month (on January 21st) my sister informed me that she would let me baby sit my niece for her while she looks for goes to a program offered to her by the state of California would pay me for child care.      I've been unemployed since July 2008 so this was music to my ears. I was to start on February 23, 2009. Well on that day her boyfriend had a court date and rather than go to the class (which was the only requirement for me to get the money) she skipped it and now she has to wait another month to re-join.      This has left me in a desperate spot. I have to be out of my parents' house by April 5, 2009 (my bday) and I was counting on the money from baby sitting (it would've been $10 an hour) to help me get out of here.      I'm so mad I dont know what to say. I'm 20 yrs old and my sister is 18. She gets cash aid and food stamps from the government so she doesn't have to worrry about money like I do. However she thinks because I have no kids I dont have problems.      How do I get over this hurt?

20090307130133AAb3Bd4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife's Twilight obsession...?	My wife has always liked Paul Rudd, and coincidentally I won tickets to a sneak preview of his new movie I Love You Man and my wife got to meet Rudd.  Afterwards my wife asked me why I don’t mind her liking Paul Rudd, but I have a problem with her liking Robert Pattinson who plays Edward in Twilight.  I’m okay with her thinking Paul Rudd is an attractive guy, just as I’m okay with her thinking Robert Pattinson is attractive.  I’m not dumb enough to think I’m the only person my wife is every going to find attractive, that’s unrealistic.  What I’m not okay with is that she is acting like a 13 year old girl with the whole Twilight thing…      There’s nothing wrong with her reading the books & watching the movies, but we’re 30 years old and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised to come home and find picture of Pattinson cut out of BOP magazine and taped to the wall above our bed.  We’ve gotten into multiple fights about her trying to download Twilight (the movie) illegally from websites that have given our PC viruses that have taken ME all day to repair.  Her & her sister by each other things like “Edward”  bookmarks and just talk about Twilight all the time.  I always hated teeny bopper scene and if I wanted to have that in my life I would have married a 13 year old girl.  It’s not that I don’t do things that are “immature” I spend a fair amount of time playing Xbox 360 and I write a comic strip in my spare time.  It’s just that we have a six year old son and I’ve seen my wife having conversations with the 15 year old girl who babysits for us about Twilight and I just find that and the level she’s taken this with her sister to be incredibly obnoxious.      Is it ridiculous to feel this way?

20090307132227AAUidKi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you think teenagers should be charged with a felony for "sexting"?	For those of you that don't know, "sexting" is sending text messages involving nude or semi-nude pictures.      Do you feel that teenagers should be charged child pornography charges, which is a FELONY, for receiving or sending a nude picture of another teen?      How would you feel if YOUR teenager's girlfriend sent him a naked picture of herself by text, and he got labeled a felon and had to register as a sex offender?         *My view:    I personally feel they shouldn't.  I think if a legal adult is sending or receiving nude pictures of a minor then they should be charged with child pornography charges.  However, if a 16 year old boy sends or receives a picture of a nude or semi nude 16 year old girl, he should not be labeled a felon and forced to register as a sex offender.  To me, it is a ridiculous charge.
20090307132504AAK1isp	Family & Relationships;Friends	I NEED SOME FRIENDS!!!!!!! :(?	I know this may sound really stupid and sad but I really need some friends. I hardly have any friends and we never ever go out. Is there maybe any place online where I can chat with people my age (13/1415) in london. Really desperate I know, but I always spend my saturdays bored and alone :( I just want people to hang out with and to have a good time!
20090307130835AAgK40l	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she worth being friends with?	ok so i have this fri- "accquintent" and shes really highly umpridictable. shes your friend and enime back and forth all day. she is known to never do things herself and by that i mean she constantly asks "can i have the answer to . . .?" we r all like "um....no?" she gets mad and wonders why her grades balanced on hw only. shes also a huge back stabber like i said befor. i think she gets it from her parents they act just like her. heres one example:   it was about a week befor her 13th birthday and i was like "hey r u doing anything for your 13th?" i got a "no, its family year this year" this was on monday so later comes thursday and nikki one of my friends is like "are you pumped for lissas party?" i was all "what?"       nikki thought i was invited because she knew i was friends with lissa at this time. when i went up to lissa and said wanna come over this weekend, or is this your party weekend? (pertending to not care) she flat out lied and said "sammy i told you its family year!" i was all what ever and left. this whole thing actually made me cry because i thought she was my friend.      when i got over it about 2 weeks later she started to talk to me as if nothing ever happend! we became friends again (let me tell you something this b is impossible to get rid of). omg it was a mistake because of course she breacks up w/ her bf and starts going it with this new guy. hes really weird and talks and acts like a girl he even comes over to our house sometime. so i go up to on of my real friends and said do u no whose going out? as if to say is anyone going out these days that idk about? she said lissa has a new bf and i said o right ty? she was like ya and then called up lissa and said  "sammy nos bout u and ty she told me". and this was the day lissa was suppose to come hang out be she couldnt (perfect exp. of her fri-enime ness.) she calls me up (same day) and says omg u told ally!???! i hung up as fast as possible and didnt no wat to do.      so heres my que: how do i get lissa out of my hair foreva? or how do i settle this disput and become actual friends? (i actually want help with the first one but watever i just need help.       thanks.
20090227081243AAh6WB7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is marriage getting more complicated or are we compliacting things?	A friend and I were debating about marriage. meaning how to get married      he thinks that people are not putting enought effort relationship, meaning that when things get tough, people usually quit. if people date 2 or 3 years they should get married anyways. his reasoning is that since so many people are having babies without getting married they should just get married      I for one think that its getting more difficult to find someone to spend the rest of our lives with. People should only marry when they love each other and want to be together. People try but sometimes things dont work

I'm getting a lot of bull from my friends though about how I'm living at home at 19 without a job and not going to college, don't get me wrong, I would like a job (preferably something I enjoy or can at least tolerate, instead of just gettined hired at the next place with a 'now hiring' sign up) but I want to take my time to figure out what I'm doing with my life instead of just jumping in without a clue of what I want to do, because I don't think that'd make sense.

20090307132628AAhuaXQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did i do the right thing?	okay so me, "Jill" and "Sally" have been friends for about 2 years now. but recently Sally has been hanging out with these 2 girls "Jane" and "Rebecca". Jill and i don't have a problem with those girls but we don't talk to them much because all the do is gossip/ judge other people.      So this week Sally hasn't really talked to me or Jill, we figure that she's just caught up in her new friendships. But on  Thursday i got a text from Sally saying "why'd you call me  a B****?" i asked her who told her that & she said Jane told her. I called her & said i would never say that about someone & if i did i would say it to her face. Sally said she belived me but afterward called Rebecca (so that kinda means she doesn't believe me)      The next day at lunch me & Jill are hanging around when i get a text from Jane saying "Go to hell" I was way confused because i have never done a thing to Jane, so i had no idea what she was talking about. I forgot about it & Jill and i continued with our lunch. Later on i got another text that said "Go Die" & it was from Jane.      That was the last straw. I found Sally, Rebecca & Jane and confronted them. i asked what they're prombelm was & they all played dumb. I told Sally i thought she believed me & she said she did, but then i said "if you did, why did you have to talk to Rebecca about it?" Then i turned to Jane & asked why she sent me those texts? Jane stayed quiet, so i just left with Jill, before i said anything i might regret later.      Although i was never really friends will Rebecca & Jane they know me enough to know i would never say that about someone.       i know i was right to stand up for myself, but i'm still questioning if i did the right thing?

20090227082443AA4nhOo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WILL GIVE TEN POINTS, SORRY ITS KINDA LONG...?	its gonna be a week on monday, since we've broken up...we were together for 3months. and it was a long distance relationship, since we both live in different cities. he's 24, im 20.      the reason i broke up wit him was becuz in the beginning, he would call/text me every single day. it showed me that he cared, and was serious about me. however later on in the relationship, that kinda stopped. we weren't talking as much, actually barely talking, rarely texting...i mean, we would go days witout much contact....i mean, if im ur girlfriend, and that a long distance gf, i think i have the right to know wats going on in ur life, how ur day was, how work was, etc...and the only way i can know, is if we were in contact, in some form.      his bday was last saturday, and i sent him a text saying Happy Bday, love u, etc...i wouldve called but we kinda had a argument, the day before, so i thought it would be best to just send a text. anyways, so i sent him the text, and he doesn't even reply at all, thru out the day, so i have no idea what he did, how he celebrate, etc. i thought that was pretty effed up.       anyways, so yesterday, he texts me (i hadn't texted or called him after we broke up), saying "im sorry to bother u, but i just wanted to say i missed u"       and we kinda texted back and forth after that, it was only like 4 texts, thats about it. i sent him, "hey mike, wats up"   and he told me "nothin much, just getting ready for the big day...u?"...      *he's getting out the military in march      so yeah, thats about all the texts we sent back n forth.       wat does this mean?      idk why he would even try to contact me now, when everything is over practically.
20090307132107AAUA3F1	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do ? Im very confused and idk if he likes me or if this is just a game... Why me?	I have known this guy since freshman yr in HS. We really didnt get close until junior year. But senior year we began talking all night and somewhat flirting throughout the day. He was always sweet, funny, and very smart. He was like a dream guy everyone wanted. But towards the end of senior year, he wanted to take me to the prom but my friends told him that i wasnt wearing the same color he wanted to wear so he took one of my friends instead. Really i wasnt bothered by it 4 2 reasons I was his first option and we were all friends having a good time. Well later that night I got sick and i went home but my friends including him went out and got drunk. The following week I got news saying that my friend and the guy im attracted to kissed. I was very upset because my friend knew i had feelings for him and he somewhat knew i liked him. S o i just let that incident slid because i'm young and i dont need to feel as if I lost out on a lot. So towards the end of year, they began flirting and it was weird because he would flirt with me and then flirt with her. It would happen in front of me. I didnt want to look but i couldnt help but to. I felt as if i was stabbed in the back and she forced the knife out so i can bleed to death. Well now that it's been 2 yrs and we both r in college, we still talk. It's not the may I add. He tells me that I'm stuck with him and he loves me but idk whether to believe that or not. His habits have gotten worse too. He's always having sex and smoking weed and drinking to the point were its getting mind blowing. SO I NEED HELP. Do you think he's serious about liking me too ? I should be able to answer this question myself but as you can see I cant. I've been through a lot and idk if he's even worth fighting for anymore. My friend did confirm that she kissed him but she's not attracted to him. But then again she calls him her baby daddy (they dont have kids together). So i need positive feed back....

I text back " you first" (She is the bellydancer not me) and she says "ok but what will you do for me?" then she requests that i "show her results from all the time i spend at the gym".   she wants to see my body!   This is pretty flirty right?   What do i do when i get there, and what do i say?   I am a little overwhelmed because i really like her alot too.   Any takes?

20090227081018AAxgMJi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I meet a virgin(s)?	I would very much like to meet a woman suitable for marriage. One of my requisites is that she must be chaste. Ideally, she would have never had any serious boyfriends prior. I am 29 years of age, employed, do not abuse any illicit substances and have never been convicted of a felony. I don't know any women between the ages of 18-25 (my ideal range for a partner) who have decided to remain virtuous until marriage. I have been physically intimate with women. I am a Christian but do not attend services since most people there are annoying. Any advice is greatly appreciated.      As an addendum to my original question, I'd like to add that marrying a non-virgin is out of the question since the notion offends me greatly and I'd rather be alone than suffer the indignity of obligating myself to an impure woman. A goodly number of the answers so far are merely judgement on my preferences rather than offering advice on the actual question (how to meet a chaste woman). Should I seek a partner in a foreign country where chastity is held in higher regard than in America?      Please don't go on about the double standard. Double standards are correct sometime. For example when buying alcohol we serve one age bracket but not another

He asked me what my biggest secret was and I told him (I'd rather not say what it is) Then I asked him, "So, any deep secrets you want to tell me?" Then he said "Other then the fact that I might be falling for you, I don't think so." My friend and I were like" Oh my God!" I tried to make it funny and said "Well, don't hurt yourself when you hit the ground." He got the joke and said "Don't worry, I have pillows." Then I said "So, what do you mean by falling for me?" Then he said "Oh Crap! Forget I said anything..." Now I'm confused... What's he thinking?      By the way, we're both 15.

20090307134348AAbKyCs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im 17 feel so lonely and bored please help?	Im a 17 year old guy. Now to start with, my life isn't bad by any means, I have some good friends even though I don't see any of them very often, I can talk to my family about some things, I live in a nice flat, am doing well in my studies, and have all my health. However, at the moment I am just feeling so unsure about what I want, and who  I am, Im jealous of other peoples lives and keep asking myself what they're doing right that I'm not, I'd really like more regular reliable friends who i could go out alot more with but am worried it will never happen. I feel so lonely and bored and isolated sitting at home staring at a pc screen and it feels like a vicious cycle because you make friends by talking about things you do and being interesting and most of the time I do nothing or very little worth talking about. And before you say get involved with something honestly I dont have time with the huge amount of homework and revision on my hands.   Is this feeling familiar? Does it go over time?   Reassurance/advice needed   thanks

20090307123943AAt6mAc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I call him ........?	I had been dating this guy for the past 2 and a half months and decided to end it. During that time we got pretty close. My reasoning for ending it is that I wasn't sure that it was the right time for us to be having any kind of dating relationship. He told me from the beginning that he is going through a divorce and is trying to uphold his business. Both of which were putting him under a lot of stress and that he's not ready to be emotionally involved. I became concerned when we were sleeping in the same bed together almost every night and nothing physical was happening and I never felt like he wanted to be affectionate. The other problem is that while I was contemplating ending things I went out with another guy for dinner, nothing happened but I figured it would be a way for me to see what else is out there before I decided anything. I never told him about this but did mention the next day that I wanted to keep things open to see other people. During our breakup conversation I slipped and told him about the other guy. He was livid!! He said he is upset that I didn't tell him before I went out with the other guy but after. Since then we have been fighting and he doesn't want to even talk about it! I apologized to him in an email and he txted back saying he accepted it but to not bring it up again. I am really regretting that I did this. Now that a month has passed since this I feel like if I had never gone out with that guy and had been more patient things could have worked. I told him I made a mistake but he wont forgive me. He hasn’t called or anything for the past 3 weeks. I left one last facebook message a few days ago and he responded. Just wondering if I should call him or wait for him to call me.

We did it back and forth for a little, and then we stopped. I told her to stop, but she didn't listen and did it again. So I hit her arm. She hit me back, then I hit her back and said,"Sheena, you play too much." Then I stormed off. She moped in a corner and everybody sympathized with her cuz her arms were red. Everyone blamed me cuz of the lies she told them, but she didn't want to fix them. So I had to apologize, which I didn't, but I'm the one at fault for some reason.

20090227080910AAcL0wt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she doing this , do i have a stalker on my hands?	his girl fell in love with me. She was all over me and even went as far as buying me presents and stuff. I told her many times that I was not in love with her. Anyway I got the courage to tell her best friend how much i liked her and she turned me down.      Her rejection destroyed me and I have left it at that and moved on. Well her friend has caught wind of this rejection and for some reason she keeps making fun of me at the same time trying to sound sympathetic. Every time we see each other she somehow manages to bring up the issue in order to roast me.   I found out yesterday that she is married. And her hand has a mysterious diamond ring on it.      What i want to know is this,,,,Why is she acting so spiteful? She did not care when (i lied to her and)I told her i was in love with with another girl who was basically her worst enemy(actually she still came after me ). Now that she knows who I really love and that I got rejected she seems happy about it from my point of view.      Is it possible that she is somehow influencing her best friend by telling her to stay away from me?? IS SHE STILL IN LOVE WITH ME OR IS SHE JUST JILTED NOW AND OUT TO HURT ME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. (She gets jelous when she finds me talking to her other female friends ).I had a lot of respect fort of respect for her and felt sorry for her at one point but since finding out about her being married she has basically re-cemented my negative views about women and how they lie and cheat.      What should I do in this situation? I have kept away from her and ignored her whenever she brings up the issue.      Has anyone else been in this sort of situation? How have you dealt with it.

20090307131525AAmzr2n	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What makes kids think this about me?	ITs like every place that i move to, children, esepcially little boys always thinks that i'm a child molester.  They always think that i'm looking at them, for example, several months ago i moved into an apartment, i woke up just a few minutes before, i was completely under the cover and some little boys comes by and screams at me!  I can't even see out the window and i'm not interested in kids!  Then before my parents died just recently, the first street we lived on my mother and i had our bedrooms facing the front yard and when my parents were gone i would go in her room to watch cable, and this little boy would always come down the street thinking that i was looking at him.  And now a bunch of  kids think that i'm looking at them and now that's why they think i'm a child molester, i have friends and family and they know that i'm not one.  Why is it that kids especially little boys think that i'm looking at them like i'm a child molester?  And also little girls who are way too young for me always starts to look through my bedroom because for some reason they think that i'm cute, I want to move away from here so bad, i just can't take it.  I don't like children, i like grown women!  Just recently i made sure nobody can see through my bedroom, i have it completely blocked off, in fact those girls that use to look at me are gone now, thank goodness.

I want to tell a good friend of mine something... and I get all stupid around people so I thought I would email him.      Basically I want to tell him that I worry about him and that he deserves all the best things and that I am always here for him.      I want him to know that he deserves better than what he is settling for.   I need him to know that i care, but I cant tell him face to face... But I don't want him to think I'm saying that I am the one he needs and that I am the one to make him happy.... that's not what I mean.... I just need him to know that as a friend I care deeply and, well you know.      So is it safe to email someone like this, or will he think that I'm trying to make a move.?...

20090227080541AAIlRM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any Advice or opinions (sorry, its long)?	Hey Everyone. This isn't exactly 'singles or dating' but I guessed that some of you might have a good insight. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm
20090227075026AA9e3jv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a relationship problem... is it love?	i have known this girl for 8 years, in that time we have become really good freinds. about 3 years ago i came out and told her that i liked her more then a friend, she didnt know what to say at the time so she just froze up, we have been really really good friends. i have asked her out straight to her face i dont even know how many times, i would say about 25. if she hadnt changed her mind so many times i would have already asked her about 30 more times. the thing is usually she tells me she wants to go out with me and then usually the night before i go to ask her, i find out that she has a boyfriend. or i go to ask her and before i even get the question out she looks at me and says "im sorry tyler but i think that it would be better if we just stayed friends for the time being.      now we both have told each other that we love each other and its just confusing. i can not stop thinking about her she is on my mind all the time, i dream about her i talk about her, its just her. but when i think about her too much i just stop and stop for like 2 days. but everytime i am around her i feel like grabbing her by the waist and kissing her and asking her if she would go out with me, but i only want what she wants so i cant. she told me that she would tell me when she was ready. i cant stand the thought of being without her, i still have a life full of other things but she is the main part of my entire life. now i am leaving in august to go to job corps and she said that she thinks she would be able to handle long distance but i have to come see her every chance i get, she wants to see me, she wants to be with me, i can tell it in her eyes when she says she loves me.       in the entire 8 years that i have known her we have only kissed once and that was for a dare 3 years ago. i feel like walking to her house everyday, she only lives 4 houses away though. but i feel like walking there and just holding her and never letting go. everytime she does the 'i want to go out with you' rueteen it breaks my heart because she is with another man but i can not be mad at her i just cant even if god willed it.      i honestly have no clue what to do...all i want from her is for her to be there i dont ask for anything, i have bought her multiple hundred dollar pieces of jewelry, i have the money to do it.... i dont ask for sex, no attention, no anything. i clean up after her gave her everything she wishes and more, i do everything i can to try to raise my chances of being able to hold her in my arms.      i do not know what to do,, and i can hold on forever but i dont want to i want to do something about my feelings      if possible i am on aim,,, tybrandons

20090227083507AAFBsH2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bf of 4 1/2 yrs. Break up or no?	I live in CA and my bf lives in MA. We've been together for 4.5 yrs but lately I've been feeling like leaving him is the right way to go. He gets upset at the little things that normal college student does like going out to parties/drinking. I don't drink much, and I only go out maybe once a week but he gets so upset about it and says that I should stay home for him.       He says he stays home for me so why can't I? But I never asked him to stay home for me...Since this is a long distance relationship, I feel that we should have our own lives. He always says I choose my friends over him but that is not true. I feel like since we talk for hours everyday, going out for a night is not a big deal. Another thing I have a problem is that he tries to be my parent and I just wish he would back off and realize that I can make my own decisions. I want to break up with him but I love him. We've talked about it so many times but nothing has changed. It's just going in circles. I have so much history with this guy even though its been a long distance. What should I do?

20090227083501AAxR6nT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex Boyfriends birthday?	Ha, so tomorrow, the 28th, is my ex-boyfriends birthday. We had a really really bad break up. It really crushed me, we were pretty  much together for 2 yrs. And we finally started talking 4 months after the break up, as friends. So now we talk on myspace about once every 2 weeks, just small talk or on the phone once a month. He has a girlfriend, and so this WON'T progress into anything, as if I wanted it to, anyways he told me he wanted to see me tomorrow on his birthday. Now I feel like I should get him something. If I get him something, it'll probably be something really small that just shows how much I know him. I think that something small and possibly humorous but meaningful is better than something huge that he'd might want. ahah PLUS I wanna show him that I know him better than his current girlfriend does. Might be immature buuuuuuuut should I get him a small present or no?         Thanks.

20090307133520AAGeKZI	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What to do when you don't have the same sex drive as your partner?	My fiance has a big sex drive. He would 'do it' at least once a day but, I have health problem (and one of them is chronic fatigue) and I just don't have the energy! I love and desire my fiance but I just don't have the energy to have sex every day! He is now always bringing it up and complaining about the fact that we do not 'do it' as often as he would like. And this just pushes me more away and sure doesn't 'put me in the mood'. I've tried explaining to him that I am crazy about him and that intimacy is not only about sex but, he doesn't get it! It's as if he's insecure because I won't jump in bed every time he wants to...I really don't know what to do anymore and honestly, this is starting to put a stress on our relationship. I even wonder if I'm the right girl for him. I don't want him to be unhappy for the rest of his life and I sure don't want to feel guilty or pressured because I don't have the same sex drive as him for the rest of my life!   What to do !?

20090307124808AAbTEKs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Did i do the right thing?	Okay so me and this guy dated my junior year. off and on for maybe 5 months. Well now im a senior and we came back to school and now he was very over protective ( NOTE- WE WAS NOT DATING). I was on a date with this guy i really liked and he kept calling me and texting me and acting like a stalker! it was really creeping me out. we finally worked through that and we were friends. Then i started dating this really sweet guy. During the Thanksgiving break he would text me saying that he was going to kill himself and it was all my fault. He said that the only way for him not to kill himself was if i broke up with my boyfriend. (Lets call this dude) Jack and i was friends so i didnt wanna live with the guilt of killing my friend. So i broke up with my boyfriend. Now my ex bf wont even talk to me he said that it was stupid for falling for "Jacks" plan. So we came back to school and i was scared to even look at a guy even as a friend. I felt trapped. Things seemed to be going great until the day of my birthday he snapped. He cussed out the teacher and stormed out. He text me saying good bye. So after class i went to the teacher and i had to tell her what i knew. I was crying and scared. When i was getting ready to leave the principal called me into her office. Jack was in the other office. He saw me talking to the principal. After i left that day he text me saying i know what you did and you will get it!    I was freaking out. I mean what a great way to celibrate your 18th birthday!    so he went to get help and after Christmas break he came back. Saying that he has changed. I believed him! then a month later i was talking to this guy, lets call him ben. Ben and jack was friends kinda. Jack started getting posessive over me. I couldnt even be alone with ben. then after i told him that i liked ben he went crazy on me. cussing me out and slapped me and grabbed my arm and ben came around and jack let me go. I left in a hurry. Jack text me saying that if i ever talk to ben again i will get what is coming to me. so i text ben saying i couldnt talk to him again. he understood. then the next day jack was folowing me around everywhere. he just got up and walked out of first block and he text me saying that he test tried his sisters gun and he can reach the trigger from his head. i started crying in class. my teacher pulled me aside and talked to me. i told her everything. so i went to second and lost it. i had to go talk to someone. so i went to "mrs lilly" and she talked to me and gave me her number so that if he starts to bother me again during school that she will come get me and hide me. so i went to lunch and jack was there he wouldnt even let me eat because he wanted to controll me. he wouldnt even let me go to the bathroom. so i went to the bathroom and text mrs lilly. she sent her husband "mr lilly" who is my teacher that period. to come get me. he finally went back to class and i went to eat with mrs lilly. when i got back we went to the lab and i tried not to think anymore about my bad day. when the class was over we left the lab and there he was. standing at the door waiting on me. i told my teacher and he walked me to mrs lilly and i had to write everything down. after that our cop escorted me to my car.      I went to press charges because the messages kept getting worse. but now all of his friends are hating me. its messed up. i dont know if i did the right thing

20090307130422AAw9qXQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I divorce after 18 yr marriage & 3 children,2-teens & a 5 yr old?	First let me say we r in counciling.I found out about his 4 year cheating relationship 6 mo ago. It was with someone I know and close to our family. She babysat my children, went on family vacations and worked for my business. He kept her so close in my family. I hate him for that! If it was a stranger to me, it would be so much better. And by the way I Hate Her!   I loved my husband. I thought it was forever. I would NEVER betray him like that. He lied to me for years. I did ask many many times. He says it started about 7yrs ago and ended 3 yrs ago. I found out from a friend I had not spoken to in 5 years, she confirmed my suspesions.One reason I was so confused is because this girl is 17 years younger than my husband. He could be her father there is so much age difference. So for the last five years I have been so depressed and used alcohol to try to forget what I probably knew the whole time subconsciously.   I gave up the alcohol immediately after I found out the truth. So that no longer can affect my descion making and all the toxic behaviors that go along with it. My husband was in the same boat. He abused alcohol too. I think to not have to deal with all the stresses of life and this incredible guilt he had over his affair. My therapist says alcohol affects your frontal cortex u know, your decision making. But he is not a stupid man. He actually has been tested and has an extremely high IQ.So I don’t understand how he could risk everything for HER. He defiantly has trust issues. He says he had the affair because he thought I was having one. He thought I didn’t love him. He is so insecure you have no idea. And major trust issues. I know a lot of this resorts from his childhood. Some things happened he has not dealt with. Our therapist agrees.   I love him. He is my best friend. We grew up together. He is all I know. I know he really loves me but I don’t understand how he could do this to me and our children. He doesn’t understand how I can’t just disconnect like he does and move on. I don’t know how I would start over if it came to that. And I don’t want to destroy my children. Should I take the fall and wait it out. Put up my guard and pretend like everything is ok for the sake of the children. And what, I’m going to out in the big world and find V.D. and people that will screw me over just like him. I am so lost and my heart is broken in a million pieces. Is there anyone out there that has made it through this hell?

20090307121655AAiDbcI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Male advice needed...My boyfriend left me three months ago.  Last night i saw him to give him something of his?	we met in front of friends.  He was cold, all business, short on conversation, looked really clinically depressed.  Said to me he is done and not going out with anyone ever again.  When a man breaks up with a woman after three years is this a sign that he does have regrets?  If he was so glad to be out of the relationship would he not be happy?  He offered to take me to the airport next weekend said he will talk to me on the phone.  He just will not talk long before he hangs up.  Maybe emotional stuff he is trying to keep down and move on?  Thank you

20090307122354AAq1iQI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is wrong with me??? everyone thinks i should be happy but i'm not!!?	ok i dont mean to tell my whole life story but i just want to tell the last year and a half. on oct 2007 i met a guy and fell in love with him. i found out i was pregnant dec 26 2007 and sometime in feb. of 2008 he proposed to me and i was so excited. his dad is a pastor so things got moved along very quickly, but it didnt matter because we wanted to get married and we were crazy about each other. so by may 3 2008 we were married and by june we bought our first home. then in aug we had our baby girl. we had bills but nothing to complain about we were so blessed with everything. he has a great job making really good money (but works 10-13 hours a day) our house was practly brand new with all new appliances, we went to hawaii for our honneymoon, we have nice vehicles, and we did not have to buy a thing for our daughter until he was 5 months old. we have everything we could ever need.i am most deffinantly not trying to brag but hen i tell people that how i feel they cant seem to understand what i have to complain about. i love my baby so much bu my husband and i rarely get along. keep in mind within 6 months we met, got pregnante, and got married. we know we are ment to be but just are having really hard times. we are only 20 and 21 so we had to grow up quick. one big part of why i feel so sad is bc i feel like we have nothing to look foward to aymore. within less than a year we have gotten married had a baby and bought a house.  since last march i have ot had a job and been at home. 5 months alone and 7 months with a baby. i feel like their is no point to life i just dont understand. i dont really see my husband that much and when i do its the same thing almost every day. he gets home between 7-9 and then eats dinner watches some tv and goes to bed. i have been dealing with this ever since iv known him but since we have been married it seems as though everything has gone downhill. i feel like there is no more mystery to our live and we dont do the things we used to bc now we have responsibilitie plus their seems like nothing to do. i dont know what is wrong with me i dont even want to leave the house anymore bc i feel like everything is so pointless and i really hae no reason to leave.  he tells me go to have out with so and so but i just tell him whats the point were just gana sit around and talk about bull ****, nothing matters. i feel like no one cares about me even though i know they saw they do i just am so sick of always being blown off that i dont even try anymore. and since my husband works so much it is like  we never get to spend quality time together. not to mention that i would like to lose 50 lbs even though i probably just need to lose 30 according to my husbnd. i just cant seem to stick with the diet bc i feel no motivation bc i feel like i have no where to go and nothing to do to look good for. even though my weight drives me crazy and i wold like to get back in shape after the baby. im not sure if not being in the real world has something to o with it and the fact that i have been in a house for over a ear now. i just feel so worthless and dont now what my purpose is. i love my baby and i would not change that but i just feel like i have lost my self and my husband. we rarly even have sex and when we do its so so. i just feel like we do connect anymore on any level. we dont even have people we hang out with. and i wouldnt mind to go out and have fun once in a while but he is just changed so much and doesnt want to do anything. the last two days we have hardly said a word to eachother and i know something is wrong but he just wont tell me why he is upset. trust me i know he would never cheat on me but but i just feel so undesirable and like maybe he doesnt evn want to have sex with me. we are both a very attractive couple but with me still having baby weight on i feel like im not a good as him. he honestly is the best man in th worldbt i just feel like we have both lost ourselves and cant be the way we used to. their is so much going through my head i just need to know someone actually cares enough to try and help me out

20090307131911AAAg3mQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	30 yrs old married female, what am I going through?	I'm 30, married for 3yrs and my hb and I are in total 9yrs together. We have no kids, and I work. Most of my friends started having kids, or are getting pregnant, and this scares the hell out of me. The ones who have kids just disappeared all of a sudden into their family lives, and the pregos don't come out much. And if I ever meet them, the coversation is just all about baby strollers and the gynos. My parents ask me all the time when I wanna have kids, but of course I will have kids only according to my own decision. I'm really sad and depressed...I feel that I'm losing all my friends, and i wonder 'is really the kind of life that awaits for me is just becoming a mom and be a boring housewife?' It feels like I haven't yet really accomplished anything in my life of 30yrs, and it seems like time is running soooo fast!! I started taking a spanish course just so that I can focus on something else. I feel like I wanna run away from my marriage, my age, and everything else. Do you, or did you ever feel this way? And how do/did you cope with these thoughts and feelings? Am I having a mid-life crisis?

I don't find it flirting were just GOOD friends so why do they see this poke hugging etc as flirting, DO YOU THINK ITS FLIRTING???
20090307132124AA6I3Bu	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Lonely and frustrated?	Hi. I'm in my last year at high school, and in a few months I'll be leaving and everything will change. Lately this has really scared me and I've realized just how much I'm going to miss people, even people I didn't know very well. For a few months I've recognized that I've been lonely and distant from everyone, and that I don't feel as if I have anyone to comfort me, and I've been talking to a closeish friend about it who is also feeling the same. But it doesn't seem to help, the last thing he said was 'try not to think about it too much', but it's a feeling I can't ignore. I sort of want him to be the one to comfort me just because he knows and seems to understand me, and needs someone himself, but maybe he doesn't see that person in me. I basically feel alone in coping with my unhappiness and stress about leaving school. I'd appreciate any advice so much. Thanks.
20090307132220AAAc7UT	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is really strict..?

I think i'm bi,   i am 17 and i go to college.    i recently broke up with my boyfriend because of how much stuff was going on, but i think i still like him. when i was with him it didnt feel right but it felt nice, its like i like him alot but i dont fully love him. he is an awesome guy but he is kind of like a best mate? when we broke up he said he would wait for me, it made me feel bad. but i think i love my best girl mate i know it seems wrong but tell me if i'm wrong.   we had this agurement like back in october and i said she should just leave me alone and she said i cant do that because i love you, but bye then. At that time i wasnt really bothered because i didnt think i was bi i knew i was straight because i was still dating my ex. but whenever i'm with her she will always give me a hug and a kiss on the cheek and when were sitting down she will say my name then lean on me and hug me. she smells amazing too. she always seems to look at me and i can tell by the corner of my eye. when were in class she will look at me for a long time then smile at me. sometimes she'd wink and say hello you, and kiss me on the cheek. she always holds my hand and stuff, we've had like 5 agurements and i always say we cant be friends then she'd end up begging but at first she always agrees.   i'm confused about who i like,   help please ?
20090307133038AAQelEh	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I have a desire to give this guy a bj should I?	I am in my 30's and have had many relationships and past marriage. I have had a desire to have sex with a guy. I recently met this guy a week ago at a costume party cross dressed. He asked me out and we went out two days in a row and had a good time. I feel comfortable with him and told him I am open to it. He likes me as a cd. I love girls and have never thought about being with a guy but after being with him a few times I am excited about how it might be. What if I really like it? Will I still like women if i give him a bj and have a connection with him?

20090307141843AAFgMsT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I selfish because I don't want to get married and have children?	Yeah, over the past month, I've been at work, which is really boring and I have time to think about life, and I am now sure that I don't want to get married, and I definitely don't want to have children. The main reason is because I didn't go to college, so I have a minimum wage job and I don't want to share any of my money with some kid. By the way, I'm 24 in case you're wondering.
20090307142012AAUtaHu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	For better or worse???????????	My husband has become erratic, angry and abusive over the last six weeks. I suspect it may be a mental issue, even a brain tumor.      Though this may be a medical issue (for which I have nothing but compassion) he is treating me horribly. Last night i thought he was going to hit me, over an issue with is ex's new husband. I can't even figure out what that has to do with me.      This has been escalating over the past six weeks, once a wwk. It seems to be correlated with his days off.      I am disinclined to tolerate the abuse, because I have previous experience with a batterer. A man (of course) on Y!A told me I was selfish for refusing to honor my wedding vows (for better or worse). I'm under the impression that abuse justifies divorce. I'm not even seeking divorce; I want to stick with him through these medical issues. I just don't care to be further abused.      What do you think?
20090307141046AA21iP4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I give up on this marriage?	My husband and I have serious issues.  He says I'm unappreciative and get angry too fast.  I say he's passive aggressive and selfish.      We're trying to work on issues but there is no intimacy.  I'm not talking just about sex, but also no holding hands, or hugging, or even a pat on the back.  He says he loves me dearly, but for weeks he will not hug me back.      I tried talking to him about it, but he does not see the problem.  He says he shows his love in other ways by doing things for me and spending time with me.  I told him these things are very nice, and I appreciate it, but I also need physical contact.      He asked if all I was saying is I wanted to get laid. This insulted me and I told him if I wanted to get laid I could find 20 different people who would want to lay me.  All I'm asking for is him to love me in a way that I would like.      He says this proves his point that I am unappreciative and angry.  I said it proves he is passive aggressive and selfish.

20090307135947AA2XfQK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	GOOD EXCUSE...OR NO..I dont know what to do?	well ive looked at porn for the very first time like   a couple a weeks ago.    Now, I have a virus on my computer, like about two or three of them   from the sites ive been on, and im thirteen.      Theres been hacking and stuff going on on msn, like   "is this you OMG you look funny"  then like sending a link.      this is what I told my mom         "MOM, I need my computer cleaned out because like two weeks ago there have been hackings on msn and stuff and people would be like   "THIS IS SOOO FUNNY" so I clicked on it. And it turned out to be a porn site. But it was my friend I added from habbo, so I think that it must have been the hacker who sent it. Then my bestfriend did it   so I clicked it again, and it was another and they BOTH gave me viruses, and plus I have limewire, so i need it cleaned out"      Because honestly there ARE people on msn doing that.   It bothers me.      Is this a good excuse, or no?

20090307152216AARtbFT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men: sex is important, naturally... but is love?	Saturday night I watch stand up comedy. I can not even count the amount of times male comedians say "We just want you to shut up and spread your legs, that's the way to our hearts." Now I KNOW it's comedy, but after hearing it a kazillion times, and hearing it applauded every time, I'm starting to wonder something.      This isn't about "why men want sex", because frankly I'm in a relationship and I want sex as often as my boyfriend does, which is often enough. Even if I didn't, I know it's all a matter of biology and the "need to spread the seed" or whatever. But this isn't about why men want "so much" sex.      My question is; is that all there is? Really? I'm not your average analytical we-need-to-talk-about-everything kinda girlfriend, and I don't like the word "commitment" because it implies you are obliged to stay even if it doesn't feel right anymore. I'd like to think I'm pretty practical and to the point. But that doesn't mean I don't fall in love, and love, and I deeply love my man. But I've heard guys joke so many times by now that they only do what they do to get into pants, or to not sleep on the couch... that I'm starting to wonder if you even care about falling in love. Maybe it's my bad, if not, do explain.      Like I said; I have a pretty high sexdrive myself, I don't nag at my boyfriend that we "need to talk", but yeah I do value our emotional bond, he's my best friend and I think he is wonderful and I do have romantic feelings for him. I don't understand why some men make it sound like you can't have a lively sexlife and emotional independence, along with actual love.      Enlighten me?

20090307145526AAdZWC5	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you believe men & women can be just friends?	I say usually one or both wind up having feelings for each other, the more time you spend together, whether you're married or single.  I think you need to remain only acquaintances or feelings or attraction starts to develop.  Do you agree, and if so, why?  Also, usually one person winds up expressing feelings towards the other, and then they can no longer be friends unless they both have feelings for each other.  It becomes too awkward.  Agree?  Thanks.

I like my best friend so much we get on really well, but there's this other girl who thinks she's my best friend, so anyway, because this other girl always gets in the way, we tried to plan just one weekend without her, and we especially didnt want her to come because she hates my best friend's boyfriend only because she thinks he's a loser, and she will just make us feel bad all day. So anyway, my friends told me don't plan anything definite with her, block her on msn and don't reply to her texts coz then she can't come and ruin it, but I already started feeling bad about this, but she rang so many times and eventually my mum passed her to me. The thing is now my parents are saying if you hate her so much just tell her you're not going, but go anyway and don't tell her, I really don't think i can do this though, she'd find out and I'd feel so guilty, but at the same time, I really just wanted this to be such a good day, and I know it can't be if she's there, she's going to ring me again soon though and want a definite answer about what we're doing tommorow, what should i say???

I would like to make most of my senior year, at least the time that i have left in school. I would like to build a friendship with a particular girl in my school who isnt in my grade.

I'm Asian , smart, with good grades and aspirations, but in terms of being more social, making new friend seems like a daunting task.

(btw i already posted a question with some more info like 1 month ago.)   oky since the beginning of the school year i had a crush on this guy named kevin. so i told cindy that i had a crush on him & she didnt no who he was (cuz they dont have classes together) so she wanted me to introduce them together. so i did. & she was supose to get his number for me & find out who he likes. instead she kinda flirted with him & tried to get him for herself & when she saw him i heard him say he was cute behind me but i knew she didnt mean to say it so i could hear. so i got mad & i didnt say anything (im the kind of person who doesnt relle speak up). so then 1 day i relle mad so i kidna told her off. then i ignored her & our friendship has been goin up & down. & 2 weeks after winter break she called me for the first time in like 3 months so we were talkin then she asked me if i still liked him. & i was like "uhh. yah." then i asked y. then she said "oh jw". then we talked for a couple more minutes then i got tired & i felt like layin there & watching tv. so we hung up. & like 2 days after we talked on the phone 2 of her other friends (lets call them mandy & taylor & kevin & my locker is next to each other) oky so mandy & taylor came up to kevin durin passing askin him who he likes. he said "kelsie & the new girl" so mandy was like ohh. then they just left. but knew they asked that for cindy cuz i no they hang out with her.        i know that a guy is no one's property. but the thing that bothers me bout this. is that she flirts with him when she wouldnt of known him if it wasnt for me. & that she KNOWS that i have a crush on him. & she never relle says sorry. & the tiems when i get mad at her she always says she sorry but she keeps doing it      & theres these times when i made plans with her.   1 of the times was on halloween. she didnt liek to go trick or treating. & i wanted to do something that night bc my cuzn were goin with family from thier dad's side.& i didnt want to end up doin nothign. so i asked her to go to the movies with me. so on that day at school i asked her if she was sure she can go (cuz there was liek 2-3 times b4 we had plans she didnt show up) & everytime i asked she said yes. then it was almost the time to go to the movies. & i texted her if she was coming (her mom was gonna drop her off at my house & my mom take us) so she texted back saying yah hold on. so i waited then it was liek 10 minutes b4 the movie starts then i kept textin & calling her she never answered so i was liek forget it. she did it again. so i texted her sayin forget it we're not going. then she texted bak sayin ohh oky. then i got relle mad & there was this time she was supose to come over &i kinda thought she wouldnt show up so i didnt want to end up doin nothin again. so i invited out other friiend (lets call her kelly) so kelly showed up. & we both texted cindy askin her if she was coming. then she was like "ohh i cant my mom said no" so i got mad again. so me & kelly just started playin on wii (well i was glad i invited kelly it was pretty fun (: )   but the thing bout her cancelling on me is that it makes me feel like no one wants to hang out with me.         a couple of days ago me & cindy kinda had a fight. well lately i havnt been talkin to her. i only say hi to her but i dont talk to her as much as i used to.       so like we were in gym. my team & her team was sitting in the bleachers cuz our team wasnt playing. so her & my other friend (lets call her jenny) are on the same team. i was sitting behind jenny & cindy was sitting next to jenny. so i was talkin to jenny & i told her bout theres a short peice of white hair stickin out of her head, so i fixing it so her hair was covering it. then cindy i THINK she said this. .  "delilah did u paint ur nails?" (well its kinda shockin for ppl cuz im not girly) so i was like "huh wat??"(i didnt hear wat she said) so she was like " ur nails, did u paint them?" then i was like " ohh yah" then she looked away, so i assumed the convo was over, or else she would b sitting there lookin at me waiting for a response. so i went bak talkin to jenny. then when we went to go change bak to our normal clothes she say "hi delilah" then i said "hey." then she say anythign bak. so i was having a good day (its been a while since i have cuz ive been depressed & been mad like everyday). then cindy texted me saying   cindy : "wat was up with u in gym? you were rude"   me : "huh wat? how was i rude?"   cindy : "i complimented on your nails you just ignored me that was rude of you"   me : "ohh you did?"   cindy : "yah u just looked away & started talkin to jenny that was a rude convo"   me : ( i dont remember but i think i said somethign like this)   " well i guess i didnt hear u or soemthing plus u looked away so i assumed we were done talking"   cindy : "well i said lemme see your nails u just look away that was rude"   so i was getting mad cuz she kept sayin i was ru

20090307144905AAML0Eu	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to get everyone to know you better?	I REALLY did not know what category this went in.       I'm a really quiet person. I never know what to say in small or large discussions in school. Everyone's always laughing with each other in classroom discussions and I kind of sit there, just listening....   Well, I'm tired of that. When someone is passing back papers, they'll call out, "Who's Brea?" and I'll silently raise my hand, aggravated they didn't know who I was. Or when a teacher calls on me to answer a question, some obnoxious person will yell, "WHO'S THAAAAT?" even though I'm right next to them.       I don't want to become friends with ALL these people, but I do want them to know who I am and include me in discussions. I don't feel like I really belong at school, so if I start talking to more people and when I become more outgoing, maybe I won't feel so insecure.    I tried the whole, "talk about your hobbies, or the most recent movie, or a funny story that happened to you" thing, but it never works. At least not with me. I've tried over and over again with it, but it doesn't turn out good.       SO: how can I get to know these people better? It'd be nice to walk in the hallways and people call out my name just to say hello. I'm done with being the shy 'just there to learn' girl. Please help out.

Today I am exhausted from softball practice for two hours, art class for two hours and piano for one hour. Tonight I'm also going to the school's musical with another friend. She started chatting with me on fb. She asked me if I could hang out before the musical. I told her I had to work on a project for English class. Then she talked about how she was so bored because her mom couldn't drive her to the mall and I can never hang out with her anymore. We had a sleepover last Friday. Oh and we see each other everyday in school.       I don't know what to do with her.

20090307141143AATd3iR	Family & Relationships;Family	Religious issues with my mother and son?	My mother is a Christian, sort of new to it, and has been botherinig me for awhile to allow my son to go to a Children's Group at her church. After a bit of a fight, she let me go along to the Saturday meeting, and I sat in on the class and said nothing, while she was the group aide or teacher's aide or whatever.      Afterwards, we went to IHOP and had breakfast, and she started talking about the lesson and Jesus and asking him what he thought about the truth.      My son is five, and he's rather unwaveringly honest, as kids tend to be, and told her that he thought that Jesus was a copycat, and he thinks that her concept of Hell is "mean."      This upset her very much, I think she was expecting the children's lesson on Jesus and what the coming Easter meant to make him Christian. She railed at me and said that he'd be better off with his (rapist) father than with me, and that I was being a bad parent by letting him learn about various religions, rather than raising him Christian.      I reminded her that she's the only Christian one in our family, and she had been an atheist for most of her life, and then we left because she was greatly upsetting him, and now he says he doesn't want to see Grandma anymore because her god made her mean (he remembers when she was an atheist) and she doesn't love us anymore.      I've tried to explain that Grandma thinks that we're going to a bad place and trying to save him, but he's now convinced that she hates us.      My wife has been trying to calm him down ever since, and I called my mother to see if we could fix it somehow but she won't pick up, and I don't know what to do.      My wife took him out for a walk and to see the horses, but I'm stuck on what to do. I do want my mother to be a part of my child's life, but she crossed a lot of lines, and I don't know if it's fixable.
20090307144848AAUfMJC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Woman (ex) has done a complete 180?	My fiance' and me have been together for 3 yr. We have a 1 yr. old son together. He has a daughter by another woman (they were together for 4 yr. and never married) She was really hung up on him at the point when we first started dating. She said she didnt want to be around him if i was there. She couldnt talk to him on the phone if i was around. Everything I did was annoying to her. she didnt like me and never would. She said if he didnt break up with me, then he would never see his daughter. She then said her daughter would never be around me b/c she "couldnt defend herself" and i am "Certifiable."      I don't know where she got this information, or these opinions from. He didnt leave her for me, or cheat on her with me. We met and started dating months after they broke up. This continued until she started dating another guy (finally!)       Suddenly this guy that she loved so much, and always wanted kids with is the enemy. He hasn't proved he can care for her, he's going to end up hurting her and disappoint her, she is "scared shitlless" to be around him (when she was a baby?!!) b/c she doesnt know him.      All the sudden, me and her are new BFFS. She puts me on the top of her myspace friends list (nothing has really changed, Ive always been nice to her, even when she was starting all this drama) she leaves me comments, etc. She recently started talking to me about her new camera, how great the zoom is, etc. etc. and honestly the only thing i want to talk to her about is their daughter.      SO i brought up child support (we would like to pay it), a fixed visitation shcedule, unsupervised visits (they have ALWAYS been supervised by her), and how we will go to court for this as soon as we can afford a lawyer. I also asked her to give me a clear, cut list of things she would like to see him do to prove that he can care for her. what she is looking to see him do, that he hasnt before.       She didnt answer any of these things, except to say that he needs to sign himself up for child support. She starts saying "what a high opinino she has of me," and how the only reason she was "nervous"  about her being around me is b/c i am a clumsy person, and she though that i would be the one taking care of her, not him...which we told her expressly was not the case about a million times.       She keeps re-hashing over the past and stating things happened a way that they didnt happen. I dont get it, b/c she KNOWS i was there for all of this....? Beyond that, she has still yet to actually answer any of my questions beyond telling me  that their daughter has a "daddy" (her bf i guess) and though i have asked the same questions (i even numbered them) she has completely ignored them, and just keeps talking about past events that NEVER happened.          Can anyone add ANY insight into this AT ALL? I am so confused how to even respond at this point. I dont want to argue with her about the past when we obviously dont see eye to eye....do i ask the same questions a third time? i only want to speak about the future.
20090307152429AAGTjMn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Somebody help me please!! asap!?	My ex boyfriend and I have been broken up for a couple months and I want him back so bad. We are pretty good friends still but I want him. I was thinking about inviting him over in a week or so, but I was just wondering what would be some ideas to get him to like me, or want me or idk fall for me again? Please don't say sex, I don't want us to get back together because of that! So please any ideas. and I'm only 17 so I really cant do much. Just some stuff we could do at my house.. What would you girls do? and what would you guys like to have been done to you or something?? Just some things for him to say yes when I ask him back out. Thanks so much!

I was walking through the corridors this afternoon, finding things to punish the servants for, when I heard some sort of desperate banging coming from the cellar. The last time I was down there was two weeks ago, when I had my valet tied up and thrashed for stealing a biscuit from the bin. I don't remember much of that, as I was really rather drunk at the time.    However, I did organise (American, organize) a Murder Mystery suspense party last month, and a few of the guests haven't been seen since. Anyway, I have heard that Colombo chap is rather clever at this sort of thing. Where can I find him?
20090307145025AAJ1i8n	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my relationship with my aunt so hard?	i need help on this because i live with my aunt and and like we just don't connect at all. She is really harsh on me, and it feels like she doesn't even care about me. She knows i am shy and has low self esteem but then she goes and brings me down even more. She'll say things that will make me unhappy. I am really embarrassed to talk about this because when i think of aunt/grandmas they're all supose to be nice and everything. i don't know why but it feels like everything needs to be revolved around her and if anything gets in her way she will come get you. she picks on me for the littlest things such as...my hair looks ugly or like i'm anorexic and she'll always compare me and other strangers to see whos prettier! and obviously she will say the stranger is prettier.. i'm always depressed because of this situation but when im' at school..i can actually be me and i feel comfortable there. I hardly ever laugh or smile around here anymore. i don't feel like i belong in this family :( what am i doing? why does she treat me like this.

20090307135802AAmyQ3o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What the hell is my ex trying to do?	So I was with my ex for 2 years. One we were completely fine. The second we were off and on. When he broke up with me after 2 years, we still saw each other but it was friends with benifits. I thought that it was stupid. The reason we broke up in the first play is because he was abusive controlling and he liked to be with other girls, but he said i was "his number one". So when he asked me to a movie while we were broken up he told me he loved me and some girl kept texting him from his work during the movie.      i told him that i needed to go to the bathroom but really i was going to call his work. i called and found out he was going out with that girl. I WAS BEING USED AS THE OTHER WOMAN! I slapped him and left.      A few months later he broke up with her and we went out. Im stupid.... And two months later he started the **** again with going with other girls behind my back.      I broke up wit him and went with someone who i have been with for 7 months now.      My ex lives next door to my grandma. He left me alone for 7 months that i have been with my new guy but now hes going around telling my friends and family how stupid he was and how he wishes things went better.      what is he trying to do?

I am sorry if this is in the wrong category, but I couldn't find an appropriate place and I really need some advice!      I recently had a flood and a renovations company put in a claim to my insurance company for roughly 3500 to replace damaged built-in cabinets . I have decided not to replace the cabinets, but rather use the space as a closet for storage. Here is the problem, the closet costs a lot less at 1400 (including taxes, overhead & profit), but the renovations company only wants to give me a refund on the difference of the estimate of 2100 (give me a refund of 700) and keep the 400 balance saying it is for their overhead, profit and taxes.       Can they do this? Can they collect for work they didn't do?      Any help will be appreciated.      Thanks!

(I took a urine test) Well, my parents arent letting me hang out with my friends anymore now that they think that my group of friends smokes weed. I need some advice so i can hang out with these kids again. We are skateboarders, yes, so that may be some of the reason why the rumor started.

20090307152824AAUkaLl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend ditches me for his family?	He repeatedly ditches me for his family. It's hard to say something to him about it because I don't want to seem like i'm coming between him and them. Even worse, he is a mama's boy. His mother is true-blue crazy (and this really isn't just because I don't like her). She has rules like they have to watch a movie every evening...and no talking on the phone during. This wouldn't be that bad, except that he doesn't even get home until 8:30 pm because of his job and they watch the movie as soon as he gets home. I never get to talk to him on the phone, and because his mother works from home I can't call his house phone. He has a cell phone but his mother won't get him unlimited minutes or let him switch to AT&T, so we can't talk via phone at all. We have a class at school together, but his mother overestimates this as always getting to see each other and so we are lucky if we are allowed to see each other once every 2 weeks out of school! I know he isn't lying about this because I have heard his mom and I know from experience that she is crazy (she talks about stalking her ex-husband). I know all this overly-protective feelings of his mom may be because she is divorced and my boyfriend is the man of the house, but he is too protective of her. He never wants to see me if his mom has something for him to do (cleaning, driving his siblings around, etc etc etc) and he always gets defensive when I say anything about not getting to see each other, which I rarely do (he automatically 'reminds' me that it isn't his mother's fault...even when I didn't even bring her up!).      Also, I cannot go to their house because his mother thinks it is too dirty?? Also, his mother constantly brings up how terrible my boyfriend's father is (every time I have been around her she has mentioned it to her kids). I talked to my mom, who was once married, and she was shocked. She said that even though her ex-husband really was terrible, she never spoke of it to her daughter (my half sister) because she didn't want to ruin her daughter's chance of having a relationship with her dad. My boyfriend's mother truly is nuts, I tell you.      I guess what I want for answers are honest opinions about the situation. Please feel free to ask any questions about the relationship as well. Thanks!

20090307135946AA2UAb1	Family & Relationships;Friends	I had sex with my female friend of five years. what now?	I have recently had sex with a plantonic friend of five years. I have always been attracted to her & would always relish the idea of someday making love to her. However, I never believed I would take advantage of the opportunity to do so; given that I value our friendship.  She has been there on so many occasions in the past and viceversa.    I have not communicated since the episode (last night) because I am honestly bashful to call her. I do not want her to feel used or anything but I do not want to call her so soon because I do not want to yield any notions that I maybe interested in becoming an item rather than friends. I love her and appreciate her, but not in terms of an exclusive relationship. Not bostering a player, but it would render her fairly perturbed to learn that I am not exactly a 1 woman's man. Albeit, I adore her and only got caught up in a heated moment.     Is it possible that her and I can remain friends? Moreover, what do I do now?   I am asking the "yahoo" community because many of you may be robustly experienced in these matters.      thank sincerely,      Last chance World

20090307142545AAHspHh	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can i get my ex to go out with me again? And how do i gain his trust again?	My ex and i had been going out for almost seven months we were doing great. Untill two weeks ago I started to noticed that he was getting bored of me. Thats when he new girlfriend MORISA moved here to our high school from a different one in serria vista. From what i heard she moved to our school for another man that wasnt mine. And ever since she has been there she stalked us whenever we went to lunch. My friends have watched walk off behind us 10 seconds later. And i have watched her myself. Well on tuesday my ex tells me that we should take a break and i said ok. The next day i find him walking to lunch with her wrapped in each other's arms. I said im not going to eat i have no appeitite. My friend jake said thats messed up right there! Now i'm trying tell him that she won't make you happy she will just do to you what she did to other guys. After i tried to talk to him he won't listen to me anymore. He won't answer my calls, text messages, emails so we could talk about why he didn't ask me if he could go out with my ex-best friend. And he didn't tell her to talk to me about this all of sudden low life going out couple. At school there was a concert and while i was there he sat next to her and i couldn't take it so i just buried myself in my jacket hoping that no one would notice me there. I didn't succeed he saw me what i was doing and he said "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you." Then i told him if you were sorry then why did you break up with me? Then i asked why didnt you tell me, i hoping for a better chance with you. All i head was that we were taking a "break" not going to "break up".
20090307143046AASXHEB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any experience of a suicidal, obsessed ex partner who drags children into arguments?	We have a toddler together, and I have a 9 year old from a previous relationship. We never officially lived together although he came round every single day and spent every moment not at work with us. He was horrible and distant to my daughter while I was pregnant, and only when I ended the relationship in november, did he become nice to her again. He swears it's because he misses her, but he is talking to her behind my back, despite me telling him not to, trying to get her to change my mind. He is a brilliant dad to our little one, but several suicide threats, and repeated telling my daughter after we had a row that he was 'going away' and would never see her again because of me,(and carrying it out for 3 days at a time) and I have finally said I don't want to spend any more time with him. The children need to see him, (especially my older girl as she has become very attached to him) but I don't trust him with her on his own as he keeps  trying to get her to tell me to take him back. She has told me but won't let me tell him I know, as he made her promise not to tell and she is frightened that he will shout at her and blame her for not helping the situation. I am trying to arrange some time together for them at a contact centre so he can't say anything like that to her, but he is refusing to go there. She is really upset as she loves him and misses him and I am becoming the bad one to her although I am trying to protect her. My gut instinct is that I am doing the right thing as I don't trust him to keep her emotionally safe, and I don't trust him not to take our baby away if he has her by himself. My mum thinks I am over reacting, but as I am now receiving wierd emails from a  'women's group' trying to persuade me to 'keep the family together as he is a good man', I think it is him writing under  woman's pseudonym ('she' makes the same punctuation mistake as him), and that is really really creeping me out. Sometimes I think I am paranoid but other times I think I am not being vigilant enough as I don't know what he is capable of.  Please help me with some practical advice. I am in the UK. Thank you.

I talked to him about it and he was fine with how i was feeling, but i dont want to end it however at the same time i want to be young and just find out more about myself, we don't really do much together anymore he's often on the computer.       I don't know how we'd cope without each other but i don't know how i'd cope if i was still with him.. i like someone else but is it because they've showed me more attention than he has lately and because my life is so messed up.      Has its run its course? Or should i wait a bit longer.
20090307143348AA2M22g	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's wrong with me? Is this normal?	I have been dating a guy for 3 months, I couldn't ask for a sweeter guy, he is so patient with me, loving and attentive, at this point there is not one negative thing I can say about him. He has all the qualties that my ex boyfriend was lacking, the problem is I am just not feeling that spark, the feeling of being in love, the passion, is this something that will come with time or is this my hearts way of telling me it's not meant to be. Or could it be related to me not being compeletley over my break up with my ex-boyfirend of 6 years (we broke up 1.5 years ago) and I still think of him, but I have accepted that there is no way Icould ever be with him again.   Please help me...

20090307143732AANtmV7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My fiance may have looked at porn behind my back...?	My fiance and I have both grown up in very conservative family's and I thought we had both agreed that looking at pornography is not something to be proud of. He has a history of looking at internet porn but after we started dating, he promised that he would never look at it. because it really really makes me uncomfortable. This was well over a year ago. However, I was gone for a weekend to visit my family for my birthday, and when I came back, I had a hunch to check the history. Sure enough, there were three hits on redtube. ON MY FRIGGING BIRTHDAY. I asked him why, and he still swears up and down that he didn't look at it and has no idea how it got on his computer. But no one else uses it, and...if something shows up on your computer history, that site's been visited, hasn't it? I don't know whether to believe him or not. I don't want to leave him for something that seems so trivial, but if we're going to get married, I will not stand for that in my home. What should I do? I know a lot of you probably do look at porn and whatever you may think is fine. It's just the idea of it all...
20090307144052AAlhZHy	Family & Relationships;Friends	I’ve come to a realization: I have no friends?	I’m fourteen in ten days. I’m a generally quiet person. I have aquantinces, not friends. And I’m aware people don’t hate me. I’m the person in school who people like, but don’t really talk to or be friends with. Lately I’ve been having issues with making friends. All of my ‘closest’ friends I hardly ever see. My actual closest friend I only see hardly once a week; she has a boyfriend now and mostly doesn’t notice me on that one day of the week.   Anyway, I feel lonely, I’m sad, I never, ever have anything to do on the weekends, like today, for example. Perhaps I’m too introverted. I keep to myself mostly. I don’t like most of the people at my school because they’re all immature, stupid people. In fact, the immaturity and stupidity kind of insults me. It makes my age range look dumb. Not that I’m saying I’d rather people be like me. No, definitely not. I want people to be who they are.   Is there something wrong with me? What should I do?

20090307150138AAny0eq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why why why did he cheat again after I took him back the first time?	Utterly devastated and in turmoil, can barely type..      Happy new year Emz! (me) - soon after new year, I found out hubby of 10 yrs had been seeing another girl for a year. They both confessed it all to me (separately) - but he did only after I caught him (found emails and texts) and I think he tried to warn her that I knew, so she called me and confessed before I called her. He confessed too but only after I showed him my proof (before that, he denied everything)      She knew he was married BUT he told her he wasn't happy, and was separated.      After a lot of screaming and fighting I took him back, I was a virgin when I married him and I can't be with anyone else, I won't be!      That was 2 months ago AND HE'S AT IT AGAIN. This time he doesnt know I know but I made him change his mobile number, and I know he's given it to her, and they've been texting/calling again. I dont think they have seen each other YET at least, but only a matter of time, right? :-(      Please help me understand why he has done this just weeks after he swore blind he made a mistake with her and he would never, never do this again?
20090307150540AAyHkg8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is she using me? Am I being insensitive?	There's a woman I've known for a while... We've been talking forever and we've messed around a few times. We talk nightly and I tell her I want more. She says she can't, but I'm falling in love with her. When I end it, she calls crying telling me how much she needs me and that I'm her best friend. I know she loves me, she tells me... and I also know she's attracted to me because when I see her, she wants to mess around. I finally told her off for good and ever cursed her out (not proud of it). Ive blocked her from everything and changed my number... I don't know how to make sense of it all.      If I'm just a friend, why does she get so upset when I end it?      Is she using me for attention?      So confused.

20090307150802AAyqrXj	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do i get my husband to be honest with me about porn?	i became pregnant in november and am due june 1st - but lately it seems everytime i turn around i find some kind of porn      at first i stumbled upon a website in our internet history when i was looking for a baby website that i had visited previously and i just thought it was no big deal and was just going to let it go - but i got curious and decided to look and see how long he's been looking and it turned out that he started around the time i conceived, and that really hurt me a lot to think that he wasnt attracted to me just because i got pregnant - and we had been trying for well over a year. yet i still didnt say anything and decided to block the website and if he tried to look for it again i would mention how it made me feel. sure enough a few days later i checked the history and he had been searching everywhere for it - so later that day i casually asked him what the website was and he told me its basically youtube but for porn, i then asked why it was on the computer and he said that "someone at work told him to look at something that was funny on it" (but you dont really go to porn sites like that if youre trying to see something funny) he then stated that i didnt have to worry about it anymore though because the site had been deleted, at which point i told him that i had blocked it because it hurt me so much that he seemed to start looking at it when i got pregnant and he got angry with me and said that he had been looking at it way before but im just nebbier now. so i told him id unblock it because i didnt really have a problem with him watching it, but i didnt want him to hide porn from me, i even said that i wouldnt mind watching it with him sometime or even trying out some new things - yet two days later i threw a document away on the computer on accident and when i went into the recycling bin to retrieve it there was a dirty movie tossed in there that had been converted to the format for his zune, so i just thought that he had realized that he had hurt me and threw it away but the next morning when i got up for work i saw his zune sitting on the nightstand and all i did was press play, and it turned out that the last thing he had been watching was that movie "dirty latina maids", again i opted to just have a good cry and pretend like i hadnt found it. so the next day i got curious as to what else he had hidden within the computer and i found downloads from both limewire and bittorrent but it seemed that the files had been deleted after he watched them, so again i didnt say anything. then the day before yesterday i was going through all of our burned movies with my husband sitting right next to me and i went to reach for a small cd case and he took it from me and set it aside saying that there was no reason for me to look in it because it just had backup disks for the computer - kinda suspicious huh - so i casually picked it up again and said that some of the other movies needed to be put in a case anyway and when i opened it there were backup disks for the computer, but there were also quite a few pornos - i couldnt just ignore it again and so i said "what, no dirty latina maids in here?" it took a moment for him to figure out that i had found that stuff in his zune and i told him how i came across it and he got mad at me for "invading his privacy" then tried to say that he thought if ou deleted it off the computer it automatically deletes it off the zune (which we all know is a pile of bull) and i made it clear that i was really upset that he was still trying to hide this stuff from me even after i had talked to him about it and he said that he thought it was weird to talk to me about that stuff - and its not like i banned it, all i said was dont hide it from me which i dont think is asking too much - so basically he was sitting there trying to make a joke out of something that i dont find in the least bit funny (which was obvious because i had started crying) and he decided it was imparitive for him to go and work out with a friend so i left it where it was - and last night i was looking for some of our holiday pictures on our external hard drive (because thats where we always have kept our pictures) and i saw an odd file just named "diss" and when i opened it i found all those movies that he had download from limewire and bittorrent that i thought he deleted. but he is just finding more hiding spots.      what should i do, i dont know how else to tell him how i feel - i tried being calm and just telling him, then i even tried letting him actually see my emotion (iv always been the type to cry only when nobody is around) but it doesnt seem to be working at all      (and dont even say its because im getting fat - im 7 months tomorrow and i am still in my size 0 pants and have such a small belly that most people dont even notice it. and he isnt worried about hurting the baby because whenever we do get intimate he isnt even remotely gentle)

20090307152319AAXjec5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the best way to get my ex boyfriend back?	Hey says he cares about me, loves me, misses me but he also says at this point we both need to work on making ourselves happy individually.  I understand what he is saying, and I'm working on it, but it would still be cool to have some sort of guarantee from him that in the future we can try again...I do love him, and miss him very badly.  Does this sound like a case of "He's Just Not That Into You"?  Or do I just move on and keep him in my heart and keep faith that if you love someone set them free...if it's meant to be they will come back?  People close to me try and make me feel better by telling me that he doesn't deserve me and I will find someone better, but honestly, I'm tired of hearing that, it makes me feel worse.  I've moved on from seeming pathetic and needy and begging (big mistake on my part), but I still miss him/love him.  Right now, he's not talking to me at all, although I haven't really tried to call him/email him lately.

20090307152425AAk9uEz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I cope with my ex-boyfriend having a new girlfriend?	I'm 17 years old. I dated my boyfriend for nearly two years, but then he broke up with me almost two months ago. He was my first serious boyfriend and my first love. Throughout our relationship, he would lavish me with promises of marriage and children and eternity. I loved him so much that I couldn't help believing him, despite how young we were. Then, suddenly, he springs on me that he has feelings for another girl, and he breaks up with me. A few weeks ago they began dating. The horrible part is, I go to school with them, have the same friends as them, and have classes with them. I have to deal with the heart wrenching pain of seeing them holding hands and being the way we were when we were together. He's not the person I thought he was. He always did everything to make sure my feelings weren't hurt, and he was always so caring and compassionate. Now it's like I'm invisible and he's forgotten everything we went through. I'm at a loss as what to do. I don't know how much longer I can stand hurting like this.

Now working an engineering firm in Atlanta 3 years out of Philadelphia Im making $80,000 years and dating beautiful successful woman and I often laugh at these girls because they are trying to get with me because they have either gotten fat, is working a low-paying job, or has a kid or kids?

The thing is, whenever we're together ALL the guys that see her (even strangers) either stare at her or check her out or hit on her or say hi.  Also, I'm 5' 1" (i know, im short) and shes like 5' 8". ah it just makes me so mad, i dont know what to do. also, she gets asked out like every day by a different guy each time, and i have never even had a real boyfriend!  i reallly hate looking like the little ten year old, when strangers think i am and think shes 27. we're both 15.

Many conversations like this:        "You know, there are only 2 types of guys out there.."      "Really? What kind?"

He's constantly staring at me..and things like that.         So, am I right? Does he like me?      THE REAL QUESTION IS:       Do I let him know, and if so..how do I do that without flat out saying it? I'm too scared to say something THAT bold...

20090307155543AAzlffX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do! Please help!?	Ok, so, my boyfriend and I broke up on Tuesday, he told me that the reason why was because he wasn't ready for a relationship, and because he had a lot of stress in his mind. When I asked him out why he had asked me out, then he said that because since he knew this other guy was after me, he didn't want to take the chance of losing me.      Today, my friend came over and she started talking to him, I was stupid to tell her that I plan on moving because I have better opportunities in a different place, and she went ahead and told him that, he said that he was scared that he would lose me but that he felt that maybe I could find someone better and that would make me happier than him, he told her that he had his life really screwed up and that he didn't want me to get hurt, but that he desperately didn't want to lose me. He is about to go to college soon, and play college football, I met his parents, and his siblings, and I really like them. I also got the impression they like me back.      So, what should I do? Should I continue to wait for him until he makes up his mind? Or should I just let go, though it will hurt and move on and try to find someone different?      Everyone at school and all of my friends tell me that I should just wait, and lets hang out, get to know each other even more, and then we will see what happens because they can tell that he really does want to work things out with me...      And then I logged on to Facebook, and this is what he had for his status on Monday:   Kristian James wishes she knew how he still felt about her and there wasnt so much distnace between them. and also that she still has that special place in his heart. Help please!
20090307155328AA623R0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would guys think of a girl who is 20, but looks 14?

20090307153811AAmVAM2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	22 years old and never girlfriend before what’s wrong with me?	After graduating from high school I thought things would change and going to college as people say you meet your love there. I’ve been in college for 2 years and going on my 3 rd year and I still have not seen anyone not getting close to me. Everyone that I know all met their girlfriends in college. I think it has to do with my looks a lot. Maybe I’m the ugliest guy in the entire school if so that is okay. I guess everyone in this world was not met to have someone, only be single for the rest of their life. That is what’s gonna happen to me. My personality most people say its nice and I do make friends every semester, but never get in a relationship with none of them. The rest of myself is that I’m shy, when I do meet girl I only talk to them in class and never ask for anything else such as phone # and a date. Why? Because I feel wrong to like them and they will think it’s nasty. Then when I do like someone I always feel she is not interested, doesn’t like me or too pretty for me. Relationships are just not met for me; I guess I will never be with anyone. I just want someone to approach me, I feel more comfortable that way.      Here is my Myspace  http://www.myspace.com/grovesttl

20090307153858AAlRNJI	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Am I wrong to get married before my sister?	My little sister started dating her fiance 4 months before I started dating mine. Her fiance proposed to her this past November. We are all very excited for them. She is planning a big wedding and set the date for June 2010. I am 26. I am divorced with 2 children. The three of us have lived with my boyfriend and his child for a year and 3 months. We have been discussing getting married this year for quite some time. He proposed to me last week and I accepted of course. This being both his and my second marriage, we want to just have a very small wedding and reception. I'm talking 25 people and very little fuss. We want to get married this summer (almost an entire year before my sister's planned date). My sister just told me that when I announced my engagement to her she had to fake her excitement for me. She feels like this is the only time she'll be in the bride spotlight and that I am in some way trying to steal that. This is in no way my intention. She was crying and very upset when she told me this. I also found out that a few of my other family members (aunt, uncle, grandma) made comments that it is wrong of me to get married first when she was engaged first. I would understand that mentality if she was planning to get married soon. I don't, however, feel that my fiance and I should have to wait a year and a half to have our small ceremony due to the fact that she's planning an elaborate wedding. My feelings are pretty hurt that she would expect me to. I don't feel like my small second marriage a year before her grand event would diminish her importance or anyone's excitement for her the slightest bit. Am I wrong? Should I wait until she's married? Should I just give up the small wedding I wanted and elope even though I know that's not what will make me happy in the long run? Any help would be appreciated. :)

My girlfriend and I have been together for about 9 months. Latley all she wants to talk about is sex. It's not that I dont want to have sex, I am just very religeous and have always been. I follow what the bible says to the best of my ability, that means not having sex until im married. But all she wants to do is have sex with me. When I was at her house once and I fell asleep and woke up to her on top of me naked, you cannot imagine how hard it was to say no to that. I keep telling her that i dont want to have sex untill im married but she keeps saying that ive got to do it someday why not now. She wont take no for an answer. I dont know what to do now. I dont want to break up with her.

20090307160026AA94HwR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do others (high schoolers) feel this way too?	I am a freshman in high school and I cant find a girl to get to know and possibly go out with. I dont have problems with my appearance or anything, I think girls would like me too, but all of the girls at my school are friends with me. We have a large group of friends and nobody in the group really dates eachother. Most of the freshmen girls either go out with guys from other schools or guys older than them that most of us dont know. The guys pretty much only go out with people from other schools, and most my guys friends dont even date at all.      It would be really weird dating a friends and I dont know what to do because I dont really have connections with people from other schools.
