20090128211240AAd7nzg	Pets;Cats	The vet declawed our kitten even though we asked him not to. Should we ask to get our older cat declawed free?	We took our kitten in to get fixed (she's approximately 6 months old), and when the receptionist asked us if we wanted her declawed, we said no.  Our older cat is not declawed, and neither of them have ever given us any trouble as far as scratching up furniture or anything.      I went to pick her up the next day and found that the price seemed very high, but I paid it anyway.  When they took me back to get her, they started talking about pain medication for her paws.      I asked what they were talking about, and they told me that she'd need pain medication for her paws since she was declawed.  I told them that we asked to not get her declawed, only fixed.  They checked the paperwork and found they had made a mistake.      They gave me a refund for the procedure (obviously I still paid for her getting spayed and vaccinated, but not declawed), but now that the kitten is declawed, I think we'll have to get our older (3 year old) cat declawed now as well, since they like to play fight and whatnot.      The older cat had an appointment this coming weekend to get some vaccinations--do you think it would be completely unreasonable for us to ask to get the procedure done to the older cat for free?  We wouldn't have wanted to get either of them declawed otherwise, but we can't leave one with her front claws and the other without.  It's not a cheap procedure, and money is kind of tight right now.      I figure it can't hurt to ask and see if they will--but I just wanted to see if anyone else thought this was a reasonable request.

20090128212838AAS56z8	Pets;Dogs	Please help! 10 points!!! Is it OK to feed my puppy...?	Royal Canin Mini Indoor Puppy 27?  He loves it and eats all the food I give him.  His poop also doesn't get stuck on his butt (I've heard that bad dog food can cause the poop to get stuck on the dog's behind).  His poop is not soft either (pretty normal).  He's a very healthy dog (said his vetS) and is very energetic and sweet.    On the other hand, I've heard that Royal Canin is not a good brand of dog food.  I've heard that it's one of the low quality ones.    ALSO,  I have a major problem with his tear stains.  It's redish/brownish color on the fur around his eyes.  I've heard that beet pulp can cause tear staining.  Royal Canin contains beet pulp.       Now my questions are...    1. Will you recommend Royal Canin for my shih tzu puppy,? why or why not?    2.  Can his food be one of the cause of his tear stains?  What are other reasons why he has tear stains?    3. How about Wellness? Is that a good brand of dog food?    4. Where can I buy those great quality dog foods.  Can I buy some at Petco or Petsmart?      5.  What do you feed your dog and why?          I will give 10 points for best answer.       Thanks for your time.      PS: He's a 9 week old Shih tzu puppy

Is that normal?   Oh yes, he also hunts roaches, and crunches on them too. What a silly cat.

20090128214135AAWKH2R	Pets;Rodents	My rat has been excessively sneezing?	Is she sick?   I know rats sneeze a lot but she sneezes more than a lot.   She isn't wheezing.    She does not have red eyes but her nose seems a little red.   The bedding is the same. I've used it for a couple of months and she was fine with it. It says "not pine or cedar" and "low in aromatic oils."   We switched food and she doesn't seem to like it as well but i don't think that would have anything to do with her sneezing.   Should i be worried enough to take her to the vet?
20090128214525AANykNX	Pets;Dogs	My dog got fixed while she was in heat.... ?	My 7 month old puppy got fixed last week, she was in heat when they fixed her but she had an irregular heat cycle (she had to be fixed right away).  She didnt bleed during her heat she was just very swollen.  It has been 6 days since she was fixed and she is starting to bleed out of her vagina.  Its mostly when shes laying down or sleeping.  The vet said that after she is fixed she will still be eligible to get pregnant for a couple weeks after the surgery so i had to be VERY careful because if that happened she would die.  I dont know if this means that she will still be in a heat for a couple weeks and that is why she is bleeding now or if its because of her surgery... please let me know what you think!

20090128215838AAGBh8p	Pets;Cats	If a cat got out right before a snow storm, is there a chance of survival? Do they know to seek shelter?	My sisters cat, that's a little less than two years old [about twenty months], got out of her home earlier last night - we got a pretty bad snowstorm [ice, snow, sleet, etc.] that started at about 4am this morning. When she woke up this morning, she checked outside for the cat [again, she had also looked when the cat first got out] and didn't find her. She also didn't see any cat paw prints in the snow [although I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not]. I'm wondering what the chance of the cat still coming home are. I hate to sound negative, but it was a pretty bad storm. Would the cat know to seek shelter during the storm? Would she try to get back home after? My sister has been calling her and trying to find her all day. Normally the cat will run from her house, and go into the basement for a few hours and then come home. She has searched the basement and the cat isn't down there. So. . . honestly, are the chances of the cat being all right still fairly good?

20090128220142AAgrHl8	Pets;Horses	Has anyone has any experience with changing bylaws that ban horse riding in certain areas?	where I live there is a beach that is not frequented often by people and so the horsing community from my town and the surrounding areas use it as an exercise area. we have been riding there for over twenty years. Recently the council spent a lot of money putting in toilets and a car park there to turn it in to a recreation area and try and tempt more people to the beach, and ever since then us horse riders have been told that we are not allowed to ride there. apparently there has been a bylaw banning horse riding at this beach for ages but they have only just decided to enforce it. There were never signs up to say that we weren't allowed to ride there. I think it is unfair that they have suddenly taken this great exercise spot away from us and wonder why horse riding is not included in recreation areas.   has anyone ever worked with or against the council in order to change bylaws in order for horses to be allowed in certain areas? how did you go about it? what swung the argument in your direction etc? any help would be great! I will not lose this spot and neither will all ather horse riders in the area!

20090128215701AA6P8lj	Pets;Rodents	My Guinea Pig is starting to show symptoms of diarrhea, and i just lost her daughter to diarrhea.?	I had a pair of guinea pigs, a mom and he daughter.   I just lost my 1 year old guinea pig(the daughter) to diarrhea on the 25th of January, i was away and my mom was taking care of my piggies, and when i got home i noticed the wet under belly, so I knew that she wasn't going to survive, because it was already to late, but i still tried to give her antibiotics. Well now the moms poop is getting soft, but she doesn't have the wet under belly. I've increased the amount of timothy hay that I give her, and stopped giving her veggies for the moment. I also just gave her a dose of "wet-tail plus' antibiotic fizz-tablets". I cannot afford to take her to a vet, because I have a low income, I just recently lost my job, and i wouldn't even have the internet on, but I need it for college.    Also after the daughter died, I went and purchased a new baby guinea pig, and she's been around the mom, because they are group animals, I've been starting to introduce her, and the pet store i get my pets from quarentine them before the put them out on the floor. I also gave her a dose of the antibiotics, and seperated her from the mom.   Are there any other suggestions for caring for my guinea pig?   i love all my animals dearly and I don't want to lose another one.

So, in my flat class, I could not get my horse to canter... he just wouldn't pick it up. However, as I kept trying, he finally got it! But we weren't more than two strides in when the judge asked us to go down to a posting trot. So, I had to bring him back all of a sudden. I gave him a big pat to let him know he did the right thing, since he could have thought me bringing him back down was because he did something wrong, and we weren't done with our flat class yet.       After the show, a girl from my barn saw me pat him, and told me that it's not "proper show etiquette" or something like that to pat your horse while showing. It wasn't a "loud' pat, or anything... so... is this true? Is it really unacceptable to pat your horse?

20090128224126AADM23Q	Pets;Cats	Cat ingested baby oil?	Okay so my crazy 8 month old cat came into my room and looked wet, like he got into the toilet again..(He LOVES water..) I went to check the bathrooms to close the toilet lid but both of them were closed....then i noticed my cat gagging/coughing...that's when i noticed what was on him was baby oil, not water.       I don't know how much he ingested, but right away i gave him a bath and lathered him with a little bit of shampoo to try to get most of the oil out...2 hours later he is still "wet" but i think its just oil residue and it isn't trying. He keeps licking his fur and i'm worried what the oil will do in his body...      I don't want him to get sick or anything he's like my baby LOL so i'm worried. What should i do? Do i need to take him to the vet or anything like that?

20090128223430AAjDAb0	Pets;Dogs	Before I got my gray poodle, it was bit by another dog. The bite area was shaved and the fur is coming in blac?	black. And it isn't curly poodle fur either. It is long dull straight black fur. I looked elsewhere on my poodle and I can't find this kind of fur anywhere. I was hoping that my poodle would look normal after the trauma she has been through and now we are left with evidence of her traumatic past. The puppy mill didn't feed the dogs for six days and they were crammed in to cages and it seems that  one of the dogs tried to take a bite out of my dog. The dead dogs were eaten by the live ones, so dogs were eating dogs.     Is there is any hope that gray curly poodle hair will grow there?

20090225155014AAiN4G9	Pets;Reptiles	My turtle has stopped eating...?	I've had 2 turtles for the past 8 years, since they were both babies. One of my turtles died about a week ago, and the other hasn't eaten since. Other than her refusal to eat, she seems to be behaving normally and doesn't appear ill.      Is this because of loneliness? Has anyone had a similar experience with pet turtles?      My parents (she's a family pet) want to release her into the wild because they "don't want to watch her die", but I'm refusing to let them. I know turtles can go quite a while without eating. My parents will not pay for a vet and I don't have the money.      Thanks.

20090128223435AAKYzVq	Pets;Dogs	Would you kill another dog to save your dog? Transplants?	I saw a program about a dog getting a kidney transplant on TV the other day. It was quite interesting as I had never heard of it before. Then I wondered of the ethical aspects of animals getting transplants.      Here's my question:      Do you think it is right to take a liver or a body part from one animal to save another if the animal from which the part is taken dies?          I can see this happening in the future. Some people will do anything to save their pet; afterall, pets are like children to many.      What do you think about killing one animal to save another which may be more valued by a human?

I would like for people to put in the effort, and keep linage etc, records of litters and matings and well My mother and I are on our own We have a very small group and we do all of the work In out club etc.   I wont give up on this breed with incredible NZ history.

20090128224411AARgRoT	Pets;Horses	Funny horse stories...?	Share your funny horse stories :]      Once, I was practicing simple lead changes with my horse through the center of the ring. To the left of the center there were some trotting polls lined up, and a jump to the right, outlining the center. So, I ride with one other person and they did their lead changes first. The whole time my horse is watching, and oh boy, he knew what was coming.       This was my first time doing lead changes ever, so we were starting with simples first. We pick up our right lead canter, turn into the center, and without warning my horse does a flying change! He got so excited from watching my friends horse that he knew it was coming. Then, our second time through, we picked up our canter, and as we're going through the middle, he spots the jump and without warning decides to jump it! It was hilarious and we couldn't stop laughing. I guess he thinks lead changes are pretty much the most exciting things in the world :]
20090128224010AAOubVu	Pets;Other - Pets	Child killing pets- need help!?	A ten year old girl i am partially responsible for continues to kill pets.  this started when she was three.  the first two bettas, understandable, she didn't understand.  but now the death toll includes several cats, kittens, several dozen frogs (which she's taken apart and put in people's bedroom floors), lizards, anything you can think of.  the most recent was a mollie fish that was a gift to the whole family and she "scraped" the tail on a guppy that was in with the mollie.      We don't know what to do, how to show her how immoral this is.  We need to do something that won't get her taken away by child protective services.  Our school district is very liberal and interprits ANYTHING as a threat to the child, so a discussed analogy drawing similarities between killing a fish and harming her will just get a red flag from a teacher.      We've tried therapy, and the therapist told her to collect a list of ten lies she tells so she can come back and discuss them.      Any advice, please!

I've bought two mice 3 weeks ago, one female and the other male.They've been sharing the same cage since then, and I was wondering if the female might be pregnant. She's quite a bit fatter, but not an all over 'fat'. More like a bulkier stomach than usual. She's sleeping a lot lately, always curled up in a little pile of shavings she's always picking at. I figured she could possibly be nesting. Since I got her, she'd sleep in a tube I got her. Now, she's always in that little pile, buried in. The male is usually curled up on her sleeping, too, but he's usually awake. So, could my mouse be pregnant, and what are some typical symptoms to judge from?

I don't know if can actually go away but I have it and just have to watch what I eat, but maybe its not the same. Anyway. They fed her human food and now we're trying to feed her dog food and she doesn't want to eat it. We bought her dry food and she ate a little but only out my hand and then we bought her wet food and she spit it back up. What could this be? Is she just not used to dog food? Not only that but she keeps trying to dig into her ears and she's scratching and growling and whining. I think it might be an ear infection but I am going to call the lady we got her from. I feel stupid for buying a possibly unhealthy puppy but I KNow she was being abused and neglected. Is there anything I could do to this lady? I specifically asked her if there was anything wrong with her and she only told me about the acid reflex. Thanks for reading.

Her mouse was a male, and she named him Lucitaro [mixture of Lucifer and Hamtaro] and he had to share a cage with Scribbles. About last week, my friend had to move out, and she took her mouse with her [a few days before her boyfriend bought her a cage to separate Lucitaro and Scribbles] and ever since, Scribbles has gotten really fat near her butt and sorta in the middle.   Her cage is sorta like a two story, and there's a sock for her in the upstairs part, but she's been trying to drag it downstairs since he left.   She's been sleeping a lot, too. Is she pregnant?

20090129011202AAQ9qCx	Pets;Dogs	Dog parks/daycare/spas/bootcamp?	Putting aside the bad economy for a second...      My husband is considering a career change, and he has a real talent with and passion for dogs. He's very good with dogs' behavior problems. He isn't a professional, but we've rescued some dogs that most people would consider hopeless, and he turned them around.       We also possess a house out in the country, surrounded by farms, on about 9 acres of land. It's about 30 minutes from very affluent suburbs, and 45 minutes from a fairly big city (about half a million people, metro). I don't think that the city or suburbs have any good dog spas (the kind where you can kennel), bootcamps for training, or especially parks - the kind where you can train dogs for competitions or just let dogs play.      I don't know if it's at all feasible and what the zoning issues would be, but it fits very nicely into my 20-year plan to start a no-kill dog sanctuary.       Anyone know anything about this business? Is starting something like this 30 minutes outside the major population zone a feasible idea? I figured it might be best suited for a doggie training bootcamp, because (1) people tend to be really desperate to consider them and (2) it's not like they'd have to drive there every single day.       But there's also the dog spa, because people may consider driving to a high-quality kennel when they're going out of town just so their dog gets better care.      And the dog park idea might not be so feasible for people who just want to take their dogs to a park (there are very few parks in this area that allow dogs FYI), but I figure people who want to train their dogs for competitions will probably be willing to drive. And if my spouse put the effort in to become a professional trainer, he could do behavioral training as well as dog competition training.      Any thoughts?

20090129002326AA1Buro	Pets;Dogs	Dog disrupting my sleep...help!?	my 12 month border collie seems to have developed a habit that is driving me crazy.she will wake me up hopping on the bed every nite ( it started at about 3 am a couple of months back) and stare nose to nose at me, until i get up and let her out. by then, my older corgi has roused and joins in. by then i am wide awake and up for at least an hour( they both happily go back to sleep).   i honestly dont think that she really NEEDS to go out, as they are usually let out for the last time at approx 10 or 11 pm. and she went for several months before this all stated without going out until morning( about 6:30 am).  well anyway, she creeps a few minutes forward everynite to where she now is waking me up at about 1:30.    i feel terrible not letting her out, but losing sleep everynite is killing me as i am a terribly light sleeper to begin with.    a few times when i got completely fed up and put my foot down and  refused to let her out for a couple nights, she was fine and didnt pull this trick for several weeks, but then would start it up again.  anyway...here i am at 2:20 am wide awake, and she is happily back to sleep.  btw, both dogs sleep in the bedroom with my husband and i.   any advice???  thanks much
20090129015500AAwuvX0	Pets;Cats	Do perisan cats have death perception ?	My kitten is a persian who is just less than 4 months and today it went near the terrace railing and was actually standing on it and if she would have fallen from there she would be dead as it is more than 50 feet downstairs. Anyways even when i came yelling he didn't even move from there but otherwise he would always run when i would yell, then i kept my calm and saying my God's name picked him up and gave it two blows to its face. Was it just a co-incidence that it dint jump or they do have death perception. Because i had read online that they do not have death perception.

20090128232805AAedyiO	Pets;Other - Pets	I want to own and breed African Servals?	This wouldn't be occurring any time soon. I would like to do a ton more research on these cats before I purchase even my first, and would like to locate and live near a vet who specializes in exotic animal care.      What sort of things would I have to do to prove me as a legit breeder? I'm much more familiar with specifics on breeding dogs, and that you breed to improve the breed to it's standards, however, since you cannot register an exotic pet (that I know of), and there are no set standards for these cats to live up to (once again, that I know of), what would qualify me as someone who just genuinely loves these cats, cares for them, and wants to share them with other good, providing homes?       Also, sort of facility should I have? And what sorts of things should the contract I write up for buyers include? Should it be somewhat consistent to the contracts people write up when people purchase their puppies?
20090129002511AApRuMV	Pets;Rodents	Can you help with guinea pig trouble?	ok, I bought 2 guinea pigs at a good pet store, Tinkerbell and teddy, both girls, and we realized 3 weeks later that teddy was pregnant. We didn't want to return her or anything, so 4 days later we realized that we had 6 beautiful baby cavies! As we have another guinea which was bought with her, we had to separate them. But the problem is, as they are separated from one another, tinks squeaks all the time and is literally going mental. We normally give the mother and tinks time out together, but then we put her back, and shes squeaking. What do i do? Buying another guinea pig for tinks is out of the question seeing as we already have 8.

20090129001706AAY2c53	Pets;Dogs	Should I let my mutt bite by Bichon so she could "learn her lesson" and stop teasing her. ?	Whenever my tolerant little mutt (picture) has any kind of chew toy of food, my Bichon (which is about 1 year old and has been with me since late December) will put her paw on my mutt's toy while my mutt is growling and warning the Bichon as her way of saying "Leave me alone".      My Bichon won't listen and will just wag her tail and keep placing her paw on the toy and move it quickly before my mutt tires to bite her.       My Bichon always has another similar chew toy for her to use, but she ALWAYS wants the one that my mutt has, even if I trade their chew toys, she'll still want the mutt's toy.       My Bichon will often start an annoying bark at my mutt while shes chewing on her rawhide and growling at her to stop it.       I keep trying to get her away and do something else besides harass my little mutt, but with no luck.      Should I just let my mutt bite the Bichon so she'll learn to stop it by getting hurt by not listening to my mutt's warnings to go away and leave her alone?

20090129024835AAwN3Zv	Pets;Dogs	Do you think I should get a second dog? Please read my story and give me your opinion :)?	Ok so I have a one and a half year old American Pit Bull Terrier neutered boy. He's short and stocky and weighs 80lbs, but he is not overweight, even the Vet said so. I have ALWAYS loved both Pits and Cocker/Poodle mix dogs and so I really want to get a Cocker/Poodle mix female puppy. My dog Léon is so sweet and loving and so well-behaved and he has never shown any aggression towards humans or other dogs, and I'm not just saying 'cause he's mine, but it's true; he's adorable so I know he won't be aggressive towards the smaller dog. I want opinions from people that have both a big and a small dog in their household and see what their experience with them is. Thanks!      P.S. I don't need people lecturing me on the fact that Cocker/Poodle dogs are mutts or not a real breed or whatever, or any negative comments about my Pit Bull. I just want opinions on having both a big and a small dog living in the same household and the "pros and cons" about it. Thanks!

20090129000754AAmyeoZ	Pets;Fish	What is going on with my fish tank?!?	Ok here's the deal.      On Saturday (6 days ago now) I cleaned my tank as normal, as I have been for the last 8 months or so.      2 Days later, 2 of my fish died.... I thought it odd, then did a check for ammonia levels and they was dangerously high. So I added the anti ammonia chemicals and it says to leave for 2 days then do a partial water change.(All my chemicals are in date and approved)      During those 2 days my water turned from crystal clear, to cloudy, in fact it started turning cloudy when 2 of the fishes died.      So yesterday, I was doing a partial water change, (not normally the day I clean my tank) and I noticed my filter had died!!!      It might have been stopped working any time from Sunday onwards... I've got a new filter now which has been in 24 hours, but the water cloudiness seems to be getting worse rather than better, and I can hardly even see the back of the tank now.      What the hell is going on?! I just did a water change yesterday 45% but still clouds, and still ammonia!? How can I fix this so my fish won't be incinerated in ammonia and die painful horrible deaths?!
20090129005219AAImU8e	Pets;Dogs	Dog acting crazy when I try and train him?	When I first started training my little Papillon, he was really good. It only took an hour and a half and he learned to shake paw, to lay down and to come here. I started out by giving him a small treat when he did what I asked, and then eventually stopped giving him treats and he still did what I asked. I worked with him for a couple months and now he's got those commands perfect.    I recently started trying to teach him to sit. The first time I asked him to sit, he did it, but he got really upset. He started shaking like crazy and he ran away from me and hid behind the toilet. After I got him out from behind the toilet, he wouldn't come near me for the rest of the night. I ask him to sit like once a day, I thought maybe once he got used to the word, and used to doing it then he would stop being afraid, but he hasn't. He knows how to sit, but I have to ask him to sit 50 million times before he will do it because he is so upset and trying to get away from me. He won't even take a treat after he sits, and he doesn't care how much I praise him after he sits. After he runs away, I tell him to come here and he does, and then I ask him to sit until he does. He acts like I'm hurting him by trying to get him to sit. After he finally sits, I tell him to lay down or shake a paw, but by that point he's so upset and wants nothing to do with me. And btw, I've never hurt him. He's never been hurt by me. I've had him for like 7 months and he's definitely used to me. He's like my baby and always wants to be around me, so it confuses me that it scares him so much that he'd want to run away from me. And it's not just me, he will run away from my fiance if he asks him to sit and he runs to me.    I got him from a shelter and he was a puppy mill dog. Could something have happened to him at the puppy mill that would make him afraid to sit?? Any ideas why his behavior has suddenly changed?

20090129000822AAuNwSO	Pets;Horses	Two serious questions (contains a lot of description, make sure you have time to read...)?	Question One:   where I live there is a beach that is not frequented often by people and so the horsing community from my town and the surrounding areas use it as an exercise area. we have been riding there for over twenty years. Recently the council spent a lot of money putting in toilets and a car park there to turn it in to a recreation area and try and tempt more people to the beach, and ever since then us horse riders have been told that we are not allowed to ride there. apparently there has been a bylaw banning horse riding at this beach for ages but they have only just decided to enforce it. There were never signs up to say that we weren't allowed to ride there. I think it is unfair that they have suddenly taken this great exercise spot away from us and wonder why horse riding is not included as recreation.   has anyone ever worked with or against the council in order to change bylaws in order for horses to be allowed in certain areas? how did you go about it? what swung the argument in your direction etc? any help would be great! I will not lose this spot and neither will all ather horse riders in the area!         Question Two:   all right first off I just want to say, I don't need anyone telling me that I should get the vet out, it has already been done and his visits are still ongoing. I am just trying to find anyone who has experienced similar symptoms before to find out how they dealt with this and whether there is any possibility of it happening again.      Ok so yesterday my horse seemed fine when we took some other horses out riding, when we came back though we could tell that something wasn't right with him. He seemed almost drunk, occasionally staggering to the side instead of walking straight, and you could tell by looking at his eyes that something wasn't right. We thought maybe he had grass staggers because he had been turned out in a paddock by himself with a lot of long grass. so we put him in a pen to let the toxins diminish from his system and checked up on him every so often. he progressively got worse, at which stage the vet was called although he was busy. By the time the vet got there my horse was having periods of staggering around in circles, swaying, clicking his teeth, was having muscle spasms had his head down and seemed like he was trying to cough something up almost. He was also slightly stiff had a fever and sweating profusely, when this was happening he would avoid having any people in his personal space, but all this would subside slightly to the point where he was standing still and calm and seemed appreciative of contact and was looking for food. He ended up going down, in a similar fashion to how a horse with tetanus would, (legs out in front, while falling backwards, kind of like how a dog or cat would lie down) except his head was down instead of up. the vet thought it could be tetanus but said the symptoms he was showing were not typical of tetanus, he also suggested a possible abcess on the brain or something which i dont remember the name of (but sounded like syphilis) which he said my horse would not survive the night with. He basically told us to prepare to have to put him down and then gave him a HUGE odse of penicillian, something to ease his muscle spasms, and an anti inflamatory to reduse swelling on the brain if thats what he had. He also got two other injections although they weren't explained fully. we did get him back up again, although he fell over twice more through out the night, he also ate a feed of chaff. This morning he seems to have recovered to the point where he is out grazing in a paddock again (not the same one as yesterday) and all that seems wrong with him is that he is slightly stiff and his balance is still a little off. The vet still doesn't know what is wrong with him and suggested a brain scan last night somewhere between putting him down and having a deadly virus. Has anyone experienced any kind of symptoms like this before and if you have can you tell me more about it, could he relapse? is it contagious? etc etc?   My horse is clydie X TB   thank you, sorry for the lengthy description, I hope you had the patience to read it....

20090128233453AAVDw7s	Pets;Cats	Orleander Plant and Cats?	I own a good size Orleander tree. It was given to me by my mother in law and she had it for like 5 years so I didn't want to throw it out. I noticed that my 5 month old kitten likes to sleep in the dirt that its planted in. He also is having breathing problems (cronic cough) and I'm wondering if maybe he is eating the orleander when Im not looking and if the breathing problems are related to it?   I also had x-rays done on his lungs, and it showed that there is deffinately fluid or heavy build up. My vet refuses to diagnose anything without blood work. I'm waiting for my tax return to take him for blood work (because its $350.00) but I really can't figure out what could be the cause of his cronic cough. what ever it is, its not contagious, because my other 2 month old kitten is fine and healthy.

I get so angry and ignore her, she then comes to me and is all loving and cuddling!!!!! I have no idea what to do!!!!

20090128233333AA8WGPA	Pets;Dogs	What should i do about giving up my dog/ puppy?	Hello  I have had my dog since he was a baby, he is now 1 yr and 5 mths old, I have tried and tried to train him (poop and pee) but i am gone all day long. He has wrecked so much of the house and continues to p&p all over, he also runs away if given the chance, but does come bk, he is a bichon frise. He is not fixed. My 3 children and me are very broken up about the fact that we have to give him away because we cant take the mess anymore, are worried about health risks (p&p is found everywher, carpets, blankets ruined). We love him and he is so lovable other than this. Am I making the right decision in giving him away? I am so upset by just the thought of it, but husband is sick of it and wants to give him up and i am also sick of it. How long will me and the kids grieve for? I keep telling myself it is for the best as he will the attention that he needs from the people that want to take him(they are home all the time). Thanks for listening.

20090128233900AA13Qua	Pets;Birds	Cockatiels ---- Myths or Facts?	Okay I've been told by all my friends who have parrots, that cockatiels are dull, boring, not playful at all, not loving, don't like to be out and about, or with you, or touched or anything at all, and just like being alone.      Now I don't give a crap whether or not the bird can talk. I don't care about talking birds, I want personality. I want spunk, a loving bird, that bonds with you, wants to be with you, likes to come out and play, does all that type of jazz.       So is this what a cockatiel is? Cause that's what I want, an easy going, happy, fun, loving, sweet bird. I want to take it out and have it hang on me, or let me pet it, just be with me and like to be with me.       I just want to know if I buy a cockatiel, will I get this? Or not?

They've been given cones to wear around their heads, which they're having a really tough time with.      We are taking them back to the vets on Monday for their routine check-up.

It looks like my dogs scrotal sac was knicked at the groomers. Now I see 3 tiny little purplish spots that looks like the spots tried to heal but didn't quite heal all the way because they are purplish. When I touch the spots, my dog doesn't seem to be in pain. I'm wondering if I should bring my dog to the Vet?

I have 10 month old staffy, she recently came into season and has only just finished, she is still slightly swollen but getting less everyday. Before she came into season was a but hypo but no more than a normal puppy, she also used to play a lot with other dogs and loved it, however, we go dog training every week and started again 2 weeks ago. She now wants to get at every dog she can (not in a good way), she also makes a horrible growl noise and i have to pull her back on the lead, she also started growling at a dog yesterday that wasnt even looking at her.       This is just not her, we couldnt socialise her for around 4 weeks while she was in season, but we kept taking her for walks etc, she just couldnt play with other dogs for obvious reasons. This behaviour isnt acceptable and I dont really know what I can do to stop it, she seems to want to start a fight for no reason.      Please help. Any thoughts would be welcome.

20090129032252AAowvN0	Pets;Dogs	Collie cross Labrador throwing up....?	I have a collie cross Lab, Brin, who we rescued from a dogs home when he was just 2 years old, he is now getting on at 11 years old.      He has always enjoyed good health (just the usual doggy problems) until recently he seems to be throwing up yellow bile.  He is eating ok, nothing has really changed in his diet.  He seems a bit down in himself (I have put it down to age as he is getting a little stiff).      I have taken him 3 times to the vet with my concern.  They have done heart tests, blood tests questioned us about his diet/behaviour etc and the vet just says nothing is wrong.  I have spent over ￡800 on tests and they are all negative - for which I am grateful - naturally.      However, he still continues to get down and throw up yellow bile, just bile, no consistancy at all just liquid.      I have asked the vet if it could be a refulx action (I suffer with this and know how down it can make you feel and the horrendous burning sensation).  The vet just dismisses this every time and has never done any tests to verify that this is NOT the cause with Brin.      Has anyone out there got a dog with a reflux problem that perhaps could advise me of the symptoms and I can do a few checks on my elderly dog and see if they match.      I am NOT opposed to going to the vet again for more tests, it is just that this time, after spending over ￡800 on tests, I would like to try and go in with a little knowledge that what I think may be wrong with my dog, could indeed be the case.  It does get kind of disheartening parting with money to be told all the time the dog is fine - when clearly he is not.      Any answers much appreciated.      thanks :)

I just a had a baby last Monday and ever since I arrived from the hospital he has been pooping and peeing everywhere. I gradually introduced him to baby sounds and smells ever since he was given to me. He was pooping and peeing in his designated areas. I have even made it a point to spend the same amount of time with him. He's gone crazy. When I feed or change the baby's diapers he growls and barks. He has walked underneath me and caused me to fall while I was holding the baby. He now growls at me. I had to put him in his kennel because i was having some maintenance done to my apt and when I opened the door he tried to bite me! He is constantly going up to the baby's swing and barking! Now he just he pees and poos wherever he wants. When the baby cries he growls. My dog is cross bred shih tzu cocker spaniel mix. he was perfectly behaved before the baby came. Followed commands and pottied in the designated areas. he's gone mad and I don't understand why because I still give him all the love and attention he received before......Plz help!!!!

20090129025947AA7K2j9	Pets;Cats	Did I make the right decision to stop talking to my grandma because of her cats?	For the past six months I have been trying to help out my grandma spay her 5 cats. We have only gotten one cat fixed - her only male. I have agreed to pay 50% at low income facilities, etc. Every month its a new excuse - She had an emergency bill, she had a head ache the morning of the surgery, or just plain "They are inside so how can they get prego?". This coming month was the last straw when she said she doesn't have enough money and I told her I would not talk to her until they were all fixed. I was done helping her and being her babysitter. Now I kind of feel like if I don't coach her, she won't get it done anyways.. I don't think she even knows who to call or where to get the information, because I did all the research. Now its like.. Either I continue to stop talking to her which basically means I have abandoned those cats, or talk to her and push her more which stresses me out a ton. Maybe me not talking to her is enough, I don't know, but family is the only people she has except her online buddies.      P.S. It's not like she truly doesn't have enough money - She spends so much on like 3 different RPGs every month, all I am asking is $20 a month. And the reason I am really stressing her to get these cats spayed is because she had a litter last fall, and all of them died because she could not afford to vet them at first. When she could, they were too far gone.

I took her to another vet who told me she had earm mites. Mind you i hate bugs- and the fear of this poor kitten giving the ear mites is driving me nuts. The vet gave her a shot of Ivermecting for the ear mites and sent me home with Revolution. It's been two days and the gunk is still on the bed every morning, and she's still scratching and shaking her head. I had to buy Revolution for my other cat just in case. When is this shot going to kick in? I haven't put the Revolution on her yet because they said to wait a week since they had given her a shot. Does revolution even work? When is she going to get better...I'm afraid of cleaning her ears myself, and i'm mad the vet charged me over $200 and they didn't even cleaned her ears.  I feel so bad for her but i'm getting ready to take her to pound because i can't spend any more money on her.  I feel so bad for her

20090129022554AACZ5fg	Pets;Horses	Training a horse to not be scared of stock whip?	I have done this before, but this time it's different, my 9yo Standardbred has been flogged with a stock whip before (not by me), and I need to train him not to be scared of it.    I've been told it's possible to train a horse that's been flogged before, but I want to make sure it's not a conflict of training (he was taught to stand up and not push or he'll get hit).    Thanks, much appreciated!

Anybody have any suggestions as to which is better to get? The pros and cons for both dogs. I know the french bulldog is a little more expensive but that's not the problem. Thank you.

20090129032854AAXI3NO	Pets;Dogs	How many dogs herd a flock at once?	Do multiple dogs ever guard a herd of sheep? Does it differ depending on the size of the herd? Would two dogs fight if supervising the same herd? Or would they just fight if the herd was too small? And how does this fit into dogs that are being trained for competitions - part time herders, so to speak? Do they get used to the herding, and get unhappy when they are taken back home?      Also, do active herding dogs lose their affinity for man?      This is intellectual curiosity more than anything else, but I'm brainstorming for my dog training facility idea, and I have a decent bit of acreage so getting a few sheep would not be outside the realm of possibility.

20090129034503AASxtry	Pets;Other - Pets	Rabbit suddenly not drinking?	My rabbit is male, and the past 3 days he's just stopped drinking, I'm reallly worried.   He normally drinks about half a bottle everyday, but now he's not taking anything.. and I don't know what else to do?   I keep changing his water, so its clean as can be, I've moved his bottle, and I've put a saucer/plate thingy full of water in his hutch to see if he'll drink from that, but nothing.   He's eating alot less now because I think he's dehydtating, he can't eat without drinking.   He keeps going over to the bottle, sniffing, about to drink then he just turns away and bounces off.   Any ideas?  |:

20090129033651AArbyzs	Pets;Dogs	Can you register a dog with a foreign kennel club?	I was looking at a dog breed site and saw some breeds i liked the look of that were not accepted by the Kennel Club (UK) and that made we wonder if people in the uk can register dogs with a kennel club in another country.      For example say someone imported 2 AKC registered Black and Tan   Coonhounds from america and they then bred the dogs, can they then register there pups with the American Kennel Club even though they were bred in the UK?      Also please note i do not have any dogs and im not planning to breed any dogs, before i get all the 'don't breed your dogs' answers.      Thanks

20090129032355AAnDD9Z	Pets;Dogs	My dog only behaves when leashed...?	Oh goodness... i have so many problems with my dog. he seems very shy. he went to a trainer for 4 months to get trained because he was our first dog and he was just way too rowdy. he would pee and poop all over the place. bite and chew everything in sight. but now that he's back... the chewing and biting is so much better. the peeing and pooping? i don't know about that... the rowdiness is the problem. he became very very shy. when i raise my voice, he would almost hide his head in his whole body. if you know what i mean. he would back away and put his head and front paws down like he is afraid. i don't know why he would do such actions. i've never hit him and i don't think the trainers did either. they really loved him.      the biggest problem is... he only behaves when he is leashed. for example, if i had food on the floor, he would take the chance and eat it. he would find the moment i wasn't looking and be quick. But if i put him on a leash and put on the floor and not look, he would stay that way until i moved or took his leash out. when i unleash him, that's the chance he'll take to eat the food on the floor.      i really think he despises me... what to do???
