NRtqNelmaa	No diesel engines needs to be converted to run on biodiesel. Maybe you are referring to running waste vegetable oil as fuel. There are extensive modifications that need to be done such as adding an extra fuel tank, installing switching valves and adding heaters to heat the oil. The engine must be started on straight diesel and after the engine warms up and the oil is heated, you switch to burn the waste vegetable oil. Then before shutting down the engine, you must switch back to diesel to purge the fuel lines of the WVO so the engine will start the next time. <br>  Biodiesel is made from waste vegetable oil that is processed using certain ratios of methanol and lye added to the heated WVO and circulated together for a period of time. This causes the glycerin to separate from the WVO and the resulting product is biodisel that can be burned by any diesel engine, mixed in any ratio with diesel fuel, or even burned straight, with no modifications to the fuel system or engine at all. You can build your own processor out of a water heater by using plans found on the internet. I have been making biodiesel at home for 3 years and have not bought any diesel fuel at all since May 2008. I have been running biodiesel 100% since and have saved lots of money by not having to buy fuel. This has easily paid for the investment of building my processing system which was less than $1000.<br>  For more info check out<br>  www.biodieselcommunity.org|`|d1ee48df00eb4b8567acf7a43aeb1c1aaa	What kind of biodiesel?  The vast majority of biodiesel is "B5" (5% bio 95% normal) or B20 (20% bio 80% normal).  That stuff is totally compatible, just do it! <br>  <br>  In fact biodiesel is an excellent fuel additive to lubricate your fuel injection system.  Sulfur used to serve that purpose, but it was eliminated from diesel fuel last year.  5% biodiesel will replace sulfur, 20% will actually be better for your engine. <br>  <br>  100% biodiesel is fairly rare.  It will work directly in your engine.  It will probably make your fuel injection system last forever, lol!  However, keep in mind a few things. <br>  <br>  First, biodiesel is a really good fuel line cleaner. That means if you suddenly start using strong percentages of biodiesel, you might loosen up a bunch of crud in your older car's fuel lines (which is a good thing generally) however that may all end up in your fuel filter, clogging it.  So be ready for a possible 1-time change of fuel filter. <br>  <br>  For the same reason, if your diesel is really old and the rubber fuel lines are deteriorated, it might "clean" them too well.  If your fuel lines look old, replace them - rubber fuel hose is cheap. <br>  <br>  The other thing is cold.  In below-freezing temperatures, 100% biodiesel is a bit quicker to get waxy and solidify.  Either run a blend of fossil-fuel diesel, or look at the additives that they use in jet fuel to keep it from doing the same.  (where jetliners fly it's pretty cold. Jet fuel is basically diesel.)|`|t1zlbOURaa	Usually it costs you a new engine after the biodiesel wrecks the one you have....<br>  <br>  And it costs at least double regular diesel.<br>  And your biodiesel could have been used to feed poor children<br>  So, no, it's not really worth it.<br>  <br>  when they perfect the process of making it out of algae... then okay.|`|npBCankMaa	biodiesel is very expensive to make and dangerous.  If you get caught using homemade biodiesel AND NOT PAYING the $.45/gallon tax on it, there could be up to a $10,000 fine.<br>  <br>  The glycerin waste is defined as hazardous by the EPA because it still contains caustics and methanol.  Improper disposal can be fined at $25,000 per day.<br>  <br>  If you want to use bio Diesel, leave the production to the pros.

MBFeHS22aa	I like a reverse osmosis water system. It gets out almost all of the crap.|`|027e4b603b33c0e5ccaa877273bf5a75aa	Short answer... NO  purifying seriously polluted water is an expensive and somewhat complicated process.   <br>  <br>  Long answer.. it depends.  the purification steps required depend upon what it is polluted with and what you want to do with the water after it is purified!  (Drink it, flush it down a toilet, or dump it into a lake or stream, etc.)   If you drink it you want it to be safe for human ingestion.. but actually dumping it into a lake or stream actually has some higher (more stringent) standards because trace pollutants can affect fish reproduction significantly<br>  <br>  One other answer recommended distillation.. but that is actually a very expensive way to purify water and it is energy intensive.   Further, distillation will not take out all pollutants... any volatile pollutants like dissolved hydrocarbons can actually go right through a distillation step and end up in the same, or even higher, concentrations in the water come out of the process.   To purify it further usually takes some type of hydrocarbon removal process such as activated carbon filtration. <br>  <br>  A Reverse Osmosis system (and to a lesser extent a de-ionizer system)  will remove most if not all of the dissolved heavy metals.  However, RO systems are notorious for clogging.. and RO membranes can break down in the presence of heavy hydrocarbon pollutants..  so you need very effective filtration prior to that type of system..  <br>  <br>  I read a few years ago where a Pakastani engineer recieved a major international award for finding a solution for drinking water in his home village which had no running water and only central municipal hand wells.  That water was contaminated with a single pollutant -- a heavy metal I think (I want to say barium but we can actually ingest a lot of that without harm) and it was affecting children and the general health of everyone in the village.  He designed ia very simple filter from plastic 55 gallon drums packed with an inexpensive filter materal filtrant (a zeolite I think) specially chosen to absorbe the contaminant.  The filter only cost $30 or so for purifying hundreds of gallons of water.  In use everyone's health (in the village) improved dramatically!|`|2Ypig4jBaa	Boiling kills germs and bacteria but it does not remove heavy metals or toxic compounds.  Many of these may be filtered.<br>  There are several ways to do this.  The cheapest would be through a straw filter if you are talking about an individuals drinking water.<br>  Distilling would be better for removing more heavy particals.  Although some organic compounds and mercury may also become a vapor that is captured and condensed along with the water.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	Distillation is probably the cheapest way to purify water.  Boil the water and collect the steam in a condenser (there are many different ways to do this).

027e4b603b33c0e5ccaa877273bf5a75aa	The difference basically depends on the source of your tap water and where the bottled water comes from (which varies from brand to brand)<br>  <br>  Municipal tap water varies in quality from location to location.  However, usually (at least in the US) it is very high quality, perfectly healthy and safe.  Most municipal water has very small amounts of chlorine or other chemicals to sanitize it that might change the taste a bit.. or is fluoridated that helps your teeth!   <br>  <br>  Municipal water changes from location to location because of the source of the water. For instance, Detroit (Michigan, USA) has some of the highest quality municipal water in the world because it starts with fresh water from the Great Lakes. In contrast Barcelona (Spain) has very bad municipal water.. I believe the starting point is river water and snow melt (it might be well water) and it is dosed with high concentrations of chlorine  so if you put it in a bottle and let it sit overnight you can actually smell the chlorine.   In some areas of the world you do not want to drink municipal water because it causes diarrhea  (China and Mexico -- I know from personal experience). <br>  <br>  Bottled water also varies.  HOWEVER, MANY BOTTLED WATERS ARE ACTUALLY NOTHING MORE THAN MUNICIPAL TAP WATER THAT IS SIMPLY FILTERED AND PACKAGED.  Admittedly thought some bottled waters come from springs, some come from wells, etc.  <br>  <br>  Taste changes (in both bottled and municipal water) come from trace amounts of minerals dissolved in the water.   For instance, river and lake water has different minerals than well water ... and it tastes different as a result. <br>  <br>  A home water purification system or filter (whether it is an under sink reverse osmosis system, a whole house water softener, a tap mounted filter or a pitcher with a filter) may help.  Those systems can change the taste of tap water.  <br>  <br>  So.. most environmentalists realize that you will save a fortune and it is much better for the enviroment if you drink tap water.. with or without additional purification or filtering . . .  you will be eliminating a lot of waste and pollution because the plastic bottles will not be produced and disposed of in landfills.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	1) Tap water may or may not be chlorinated.<br>  2) There may be leaching from the plastic.<br>  3) Cost is very different.<br>  4) Most important, tap water is much more heavily regulated, at least in the U.S., than bottled water is. I've seen bottled water (outside the U.S.) that would not even pass WHO drinking water standards, which are incredibly lax.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	As another poster said, a lot of bottled water is just municipal water that has been filtered. You'd be getting the same thing by buying a water filter for your tap.<br>  <br>  Another factor is perceived taste. I've had friends who swear by bottle water but when I gave them tap water in a bottle without telling them it was tap water they didn't notice the taste at all. Since it was in a bottle it *must* taste good. I'd suggest doing a double-blind taste test and seeing if you actually can tell the difference. If you can't it'll be a lot easier to tell yourself that there's no point buying bottled water.<br>  <br>  As for health, in the developed world I don't think there's a significant difference between the two.|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Where your water comes from and how it is treated can affect the taste. A lot of bottled water is no more than tap water that has been filtered. Some companies add minerals to it which also changes the taste.

I'll put a few links to more information on bottled water and it's effects on pollution and habitat destruction. CA is in a fight with Nestle because they are draining aquifers and destroying habitats.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	New studies are finding that often bottled water is no better quality than municipal tap water. Though tap water does usually contain chlorine.<br>  <br>  As for well water, most is very safe and does not contain chlorine.

I have a Brita pitcher that I use for drinking water and cooking. I fill my stainless water bottle for travel. Was also tired of carting bottles from the store to home then to recycle.<br>  <br>  The chlorine will be removed by the Brita filter. You will love the taste of water from the pitcher.<br>  The pitchers run from $10-20 each and replacement filters are around $5-6. each. They filter 40 gallons, family of 2, I change it every 4 weeks.<br>  I just got a deal on filters, Target 4 for $18. this week.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	The big difference is the price.  Some bottled water *is* straight tap water.  The taste difference is probably due to chlorine, and a faucet-mounted filter will remove the chlorine from your tap water for months for the price of a 12-pack of bottled water.|`|BjS8k8Cyaa	Neither are healthier than the other, so to stop using plastic bottled water would be a very good and conservative thing to do.<br>  The reason that bottled tastes different to tap is because some of the chemicals in which the plastic is made goes into the water.

In North America, South Asia, Australasia and Asia, the term sister cities is used for the same concept and brother cities is the term in the former Soviet bloc.

6WcTEpbWaa	I am indeed worried about global warming.  I fear that as a student in high school, many adults do not worry about it as much as they should because it won't affect them.  However, I realize that global warming is a crisis that my generation will more than likely have to deal with, and that is why I hope that adults would realize that is unfair to leave us with a mess they created.  Currently, I am enrolled in an environmental science course, and it appears to me that the facts far outweigh the doubts. <br>          I am concerned because we only get one planet.  There is nowhere we can go.  If we ruin this one, we ruin civilization itself.  To me, this seems reason enough for concern.  While one can argue that there are doubts, wouldn't we rather be safe than sorry?  When we ride in cars, we put seat belts on with the chance that if we do end up in a car accident, we minimize the effects.  Why would we not do the same with our planet?<br>          Furthermore, we are not the only inhabitants of this planet.  If we decide to ignore global warming and it does turn out to be a real issue, we have no one to blame but ourselves.  The polar bears don't get a say in this.  Why should we subject them to our decisions?  If any of you have so much as a small moral bone in your body, you would see that it is important that we make every effort possible to help out any animals we possibly can, even if global warming turns out to be just a cycle.<br>          I'd also like to state that we are harming our planet, and many of the ways that we are harming it are the same ways that we are causing global warming according to scientists.  Even if you doubt global warming, why would you not want to prevent other means of harm to Earth?  We should be making every possible effort to stop this current warming trend, regardless of whether or not you believe in global warming.  The facts state simply and clearly that the planet is warming.<br>          Also, to the author of this question, I would like to mention that in Al Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth," he shows why the polar ice caps are experiencing the warming trend more than other areas.  His documentary is very interesting, even if you don't believe that global warming exists.|`|6VeaZhXGaa	Look global warming happens naturally they had an ice age for 200 years a few centuries ago an people in London used to ice skate on the River Thames it just happens and we are like 1% of what the earth does it's self. The ice caps might melt we can't control everyone and I don't think it would happen in our life time. An the scientist have to say they are studying global warming to get funded I bet they know the earth's climate is not that bad they just do it to get us all worried.|`|fcb9c7d570ea4f9bf655c4348c507672aa	Being that the polar bears are at record numbers, and that they survived the warmer climate optimum, I do not think you need to worry about them.<br>  <br>  As for us, our ancestors were able to survive the Ice age 18,000 years ago. Why would any thinking individual think we will not survive the natural warming and cooling cycles? I must admit though, that another ice age would be very harsh on us.|`|AA10555732	yea There Guessing<br>  the ice caps are melting, so What, there melting as they have melted some million other times over the Earths span of 4.55 Billion years<br>  It's what we call a cycle<br>  you should see what happens when a metor the size of Texas hits Earth<br>  talk about climate change WOW<br>  I'll put my sweater on for that one|`|WKvl8zlCaa	That news is very sobering !  In the reports of climate change, there is a mention of the real possibility that the rate of change will be very abrupt. I tend to think it will be very abrupt.   We can expect storms that defy description ! We can expect extremely deadly weather events such as droughts, floods, and wildfires.   The continent of Australia is on the front lines of abrupt climate change. No Aussie still believes that AGW is a hoax or a fraud by Al Gore to raise their taxes in Australia. lol !|`|t1zlbOURaa	No, I'm worried about the rate at which people believe it.|`|sfC6L8ybaa	Concerned?- Yes- the mass of data and studies support concern.<br>  Frantic/ hyper about above? No- lets all work toward good science.|`|jU0dGPzUaa	No, I am not concerned. <br>  Scientists figured it out, and I think they can figure out a way to stop it. <br>  So what would happen if the artic ice did melt? Would the whole world be covered in water and we'd all die?<br>  The seals and and polar bears would all die I guess... :/<br>  Why are we having global warming? I'm sorry, I'm not fully informed on stuff like this.|`|qQq23yziaa	Don't want to sound like a jerk. but I don't believe in Global warming. eve al gore said all the fact are in and that some of the theory's may not be right.  But I admire your concern, its nice that you care when most people do'nt|`|iTetA3oCaa	No.  Global warming math does not work and you don't have to be a "weather scientist?" to figure that out.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	I'm not worried or concerned.  The rate of global warming ended in 1998, since then there has been no further warming.  It leveled off and many believe we're entering a cooling period.  All of this is natural and has happened for millions of years.|`|zince8g1aa	Exactly when arctic summer sea ice extent will be gone is somewhat of an open question, but it's certainly happening much faster than predicted.

I'm not worried. The human race has always adapted. Plus even the best computer's can't predict something as unpredictable as the earth.<br>  Alot of your information is biased anyway, just about everything discussing that topic is biased.|`|aeVz0lrBaa	not really, seeing as any warming seems to be decreasing anyway.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadcrut3/diagnostics/global/nh+sh/" rel="nofollow">http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadcrut3/dia...</a>|`|NqGkbDetaa	The National Snow and Ice Data Center does not seem to share your panic.<br>  <br>  The ice mass trend is up from the year before.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	That is not what I hear.U need to check your source.At point Barrow it is much colder,  that it has been for years.|`|PL1hHo3Zaa	Don't believe in it sorry|`|3NZV65alaa	No I am not concerned at the rate of global warming, nor am I concerned about the polar bears or seals being endangered from possible melting of polar ice.<br>  Why?<br>  Simply because neither seals nor polar bears require the ice in order to survive. They will adapt as they have done in the past many times before. As recently as 1938 the Artic ice was nearly gone completely and was restored to normal levels by 1947.<br>  A recent article which I enjoyed, and believe is worth looking at even though it is not a scientific reference.<br>  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1097850/RICHARD-LITTLEJOHN-If-Del-Boy-today-hed-trading-carbon-offsets.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/articl...</a><br>  <br>  What does bother me is the arrogance, greed, and ignorance that allows this scam to perpetuate and how proper science and factual information are completely ignored.<br>  <br>  If more people had a basic understanding of science, they would be far less likely to be brainwashed by media hype and be able to concentrate on real and important issues which we can control and solve.<br>  <br>  I happen to like science. I detest science abuse.|`|ZWnUXirVaa	No; I'm not at all worried.<br>  <br>  Look at the predictions you quote. These guys can't make up their mind about what is happening and how fast. I recently read another story about a report that says ice is getting thicker and is now back to the same level as was recorded in 1970.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to believe that the current climate is ideal. In the past humans have thrived and agriculture has boomed in climates warmer than today. In fact, warming temperatures, rising sea levels, and mass extinctions/adaptations may end up being a very good thing for Earth and the those of us that live here.<br>  <br>  It doesn't make sense to stress out and worry about things that can not be changed.
L8zmQS8Jaa	Your question is very broad.  One website that would show all the possibilities would have to be showing anything that did not use gasoline of diesel fuel.  Even these might be permitted if they were part of a hybrid vehicle.  To get one website that might show vehicles using CNG, LPG, bio fuels, compressed air, electricity, solar power, wood, human and animal power in all the various forms would be a place that would be very broad.  Not too many places would tend to have dog sleds and bicycles next to a compressed natural gas vehicle or a battery electric vehicle.  I have many sources.  If you were to be a little more narrow with your question I might provide something more than just look through the various articles of Wikipedia.

2Ypig4jBaa	Harness the kinetic energy of the wind.<br>  The problem with wind is that you may want power when the wind is not blowing.  One way to store this potential energy is to use the wind to power water pumps.  These pumps can be electrical or mechanical.<br>  After water has been pumped uphill to a storage tank or even a lake, you may harness this potential energy by letting gravity pull the water back down the hill to power hydro water turbines.<br>  <br>  This way you can get the most out of peak producing times with the wind any still have energy when you want it.

H41u0B8Jaa	I would start by throwing away all your food that isn't in cans.  Those bugs from what you describe are the ones that get into flour and any other food in your cupboard.  I suggest clearing out your food cupboards and washing them down with soap and water.  Also, vacuum your furniture and carpets thoroughly.  When you replace your flour, pasta, etc. be sure to put them in airtight containers and don't leave them in their original packages otherwise the little bugs may come back.  If this doesn't do the trick then you may need to call an exterminator.

Th2qZedsaa	dont be mean let him eat aswell, hes hungry too!!<br>  <br>  :(|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Short answer, no. You can dissuade the squirrel a bit but that is all. One way is hanging the feeder from a horizontal line, higher than the squirrel can jump. You need a ladder to fill it. Since squirrels can walk the line. you have to string 2-litre soda bottles on the line, through the mouth and a hole in the bottom. The loosely-attached bottle will spin and dump the squirrel. You can also get red pepper to coat the birdseed. Birds like it. Squirrels don't. Aside from that, the other "solutions" are lethal to the squirrel.|`|E4jwk6r0aa	considering it is open range, it does not know better, try talking to it.|`|737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	Unfortunately, the answer is no you cannot make him stop. Even if you get rid of 1 squirrel more will come.<br>  <br>  The best solution is a squirrel proof feeder.  The most reliable is all metal and has a tilt mechanism that closes the opening to the seed if the squirrel tries to get at it.  These cost about $75. <br>  <br>  There are other designs but they are even more expensive and of dubious reliability<br>  <br>  The hanging mount is best, because it also keeps the raccoon from raiding the feeder at night.  With a pole mount the raccoon can do what the squirrel cannot.<br>  <br>  It is actually very comical to watch the squirrel try to beat the tilt type design. They go through all sorts of acrobatics, but always fail.<br>  <br>  I have been using this type of feeder for 20 years with 100% success.|`|IiPsUxM7aa	The national autobahn society many yrs ago did a study , If you get a silhouette of a bird of prey and hang it in a tree close to your feeder you will most probably at least for a time enjoy no squirrel.<br>    But that same applies to all the little birds you enjoy watching , MY ADVISE !!  KILL the little Bastard.|`|rstQ6OkGaa	Yes.  A .22 or a good pellet gun will make him stop.
