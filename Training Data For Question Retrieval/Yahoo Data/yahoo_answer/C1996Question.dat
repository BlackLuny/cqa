I am looking for good wii games for me and my girlfriend to play together.  There are plenty of good 'party' games out there but what we are ideally looking for are 2 player co-op games, and ideally where you both operate on the same screen (rather than the screen splitting which we hate) and where you both actively participate (zak and wiki isnt great because one player just points out to the other one what they can do).

I like to be 100% sure about my decision before I drop 200 dollars on a phone so any feedback is appreciated!

20090308045354AAca4Rg	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Other - Games & Gear	DS Battery charger + power surge question?	I have two broken DS fats. Both of them broke during a power surge at my brothers while charging, (BAD day!)       I have soldered over all the fuses creating two working DS again (one has a crushed bottom screen so it's still unusable)      Problem is, is that with them soldered over... one more power surge and I can wave good bye to them permanently.      My questions are...      1. Does the battery give off a power surge that I should worry about?       2. How can I charge the battery without having it be in the DS to run the risk of another power surge?      3. If I get a power supply with that little switch that protects against surges, would that protect against a small enough one that would ruin a charging DS with no fuses?

Do you think this will change in the near future or are they going to keep the Wii a "family" type system. I know they do have some good games. Also, while they sell the wii, Xbox 360 and PS3, still being non-movement controller users are making big bucks on great games (not to mention good graphics) while wii has not so good graphics and bad games. I am actually not a "bedroom gamer" but i enjoy multiplayer action games. Not something rated M but even if the come with something as small as starfox for wii would be great. But like I said, i am a huge Multiplayer game fan. But dont think i hate the wii, i have seen (and have) some great games with a great storyline, good graphics, and not tones of blood, gores, or a rating over teen

20090308072214AA2iO6n	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Buying a digital camera! Could somebody offer their advice?	I'm looking for a digital camera, perhaps between the $150-350 range. So I think that leaves Digital SLR's out of the question.      What I'm really looking for is superior image quality, and there's so many choices that I'm kind of lost trying to pick one out.      In terms of image quality, I've heard that the: Canon Powershot A2000 IS is the way to go. What are your thoughts of that? Or any recommendations of your own?      I'm looking to use it for photos in around the city, quality pictures at day and night are of equal importance to me if that's of any importance. Thanks for your time. :-)

I have noticed that there are quite a few wii gun adapters and some are good and some are bad due to some reviews i have read.      I don't know which one to buy and i don't want to just buy on then buy another as money doesn't grow on trees. There are gun adapters that hold both the nunchuck and the remote and i don't know which ones are better      An answer of the gun and a website to buy it from would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

20090308090332AAUygZ4	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Which are the most interesting Wii games for grown-up/conventional gamers?	Hi      Most Wii games seem to be somewhat childish, shallow, lacking in involvement & long term appeal ... and thus don't interest me much.      I'd like to know which Wii games would appeal most to me (as an older, more experienced/conventional video game player) ... I don't mean the typical FPS/blood/gore/mature/rated video games, but games that are generally more interesting, involved, challenging, etc.      Thanks.

20090308091111AAWlqJ5	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Looking to upgrade my Nikon D40 to a semi-pro/pro...help!?	I have been very happy with my Nikon D40, at least up until recently. I have been addicted to looking at professional photography online and wondering...is it time to upgrade!?       I know A LOT goes into a photograph, most most importantly the photographer but I'm guessing it's a right time to upgrade. I consider myself a semi-pro at this point and need help on upgrade options. I want the detail, the professionalism, little/no noise I see in these professional photographs online.       I have been looking at the Nikon D90 and Canon EOS 30/40D. Will I see a significant difference in picture quality with one of these compared to my D40? Do they have larger sensors? Is it worth the investment? or should I just look at getting a lower aperture/higher quality lens? I currently and using a Nikkor 18-55mm and 55-200mm VR lens.       I'm really looking into taking great close up portraits/macro and overall increase in professionalism.       Thanks to all that respond!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      Budget: Under $1500 USD
