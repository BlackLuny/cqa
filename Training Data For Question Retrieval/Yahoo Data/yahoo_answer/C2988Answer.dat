zFsTSrOcaa	To change my mind about anthropogenic climate change, I would have to see:    1.  Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels stop increasing.  Despite any noise to the contrary, CO2 is a greenhouse gas, the properties of which are well known.    2.  Global mean temperatures decline over a period of at least one full solar sunspot cycle.  Solar output does vary with the sunspot cycle by about 1%, with the highest output at sunspot maximum.  Since we are currently at a sunspot minimum, solar insolation is also at a minimum, and the small short-term decline in mean temperature may be a reflection of that.    It is important to note (and easy to ignore) that "global warming" refers to the mean temperature of the entire planet, not the seasonal extremes.  At present, even over the last couple of weeks, there have been more record high temperatures reported than record lows, not a likely scenario if the earth is indeed cooling.|`|rSEgd1Umaa	I don't know about Minnesota but glaciers are melting left right and center.

I'll grant that record cold is not quite what was expected, but record snow? What does 'record snow' have to do with global warming/cooling? Once you go below freezing, which most places who had these records do at some point every year, the only thing that determines snowfall is moisture. Saying "boy look at all that snow, it must be really cold" makes about as much sense as saying "California just got 30 inches of rain--it must be scorching hot there"    As for cold, realize that in the last 120 years, temperatures have only gone up by about 1.3 F --much less in the US Midwest, which has not had nearly the warming as the rest of the world. It is called 'global warming' and not 'Minnesota warming' for a reason. Take a look at the 2008 graph and check where you state falls: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs...  (Hint: green is cooler than red)    Now even if that were not true about Minnesota, it still wouldn't mean much. 1.3 degrees over 120 years is not very significant on the whole. It would not eliminate erratic weather patterns and the fact that some winters are just colder than others. No one said global warming would ever eliminate winter. It will always be painfully cold in Minnesota in January even if temperatures rise to dangerously high levels.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	For starters, stop trying to cite weather events as evidence of anything regarding global warming or climate change.  Especially snow, which proves absolutely nothing except that it's cold (pretty standard for winter) and there's precipitation in the air.    I could cite examples of hot weather too.  For example, parts of Australia are experiencing very hot temperatures right now, particularly Perth which is having a record hot January.  But again, that would prove nothing regarding *global* warming.  It's just weather.    As for the ice caps, I don't know where you get that they're growing.  Probably from that grossly wrong Daily Tech article.  The reality is that the Antarctic ice cap may be growing slightly, but the Arctic is melting rapidly.  In fact, just recently the Arctic sea ice extent surpassed the record low of last year.  http://www.nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/i...    Basically to start with, you need to learn the basic science like the difference between weather and climate.  Then you need to make some arguments which actually apply to the global climate.  For example, nobody cares if it's cold where you live when we're in the middle of the 5th-hottest winter on record on a *global* scale.  http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabled...    After that, you need to stop arguing that any scientific study whose conclusions you don't like is "propaganda".  It doesn't make you very credible when you call an NOAA report propaganda.    If you're interested in learning about the science, I recommend the link below.  http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global...

pnCOR1UVaa	I think you misunderstood what was said. Recycling doesn't go into a landfill. It is sorted and shipped to a plant before it has a chance to begin to break down. Waste either gets reused or buried in a landfill. Landfills give off methane for decades as the items buried in it break down, they also leach many other harmful chemicals which the landfill is designed to prevent from entering the surrounding soil and water.     Recycling has a value, although recently it has dropped. Cities often get paid for the recycled materials and that helps keep waste removal fees low. In CA we are able to recycle over 1/2 of the waste we produce, so we are able to double the life of our landfills. In the US we close an average of one landfill a day because of the amount of waste we produce. Without recycling we would be filling landfills twice as fast.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	i bow to you folks who do green living..but do you guys really think you are going to change the planets air and land...there arent nearly enough green living people to even come close..i am not saying to give up..but do you really think you guys will succeed..i mean trash is trash..its either recycled or burnt plus the billions of tons of trash on the highways and such...its like fighting a losing battle..|`|iGYl4rnhaa	Every form of decomposing anything would produce gasses. The gases are not actually poisonous or harmful to us. They're just saying that we need to find better solutions fast because after 30 years there would've been so much gas produced already that would be just as bad as not recycling. Recycling helps us and the enviroment so much. Landfills pollute the soil for miles and when all the trash decomposing together creates bad toxins, its released into the air. Landfills are so much worse than recycling because even after they cover the trash fumes are still let out through pipes which we breathe in as well as allow it into the atmosphere. Yes definatley recycling helps us. Even if they havent found the best solution yet it still saves 50 percent of gas and smog due to factories which make paper, plastic, etc. Recycling isnt bad. Its just a possibility which people think is serious, its not. Why would recycling be bad? I hope you found this helpful..honestly thats just what i believe to be true. im only 13 so sorry if im wrong [: good luck!|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Where do you get the idea that recycling is dumped in a landfill? It may end up in a storage site temporarily but it will soon go to a recycling facility. Yes, some "recycling" is probably left for a while because prices are low but at least it's separated so that when prices are high again it can easily be recycled.    If you're concerned about gases coming out of the recycling process, you're right, there probably are. But compare those gases to the gases produced when raw materials are mined and a product is manufactured and you'll see that recycling is the lesser of two evils.     Ideally people would use less and there would be no recycling or waste, but until that day recycling is the most responsible option we have.|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	No, atleast...I personally don't think there would be a point if it just passes out poisonous gases...

IDZTtipeaa	I assume you are referring to John R. Christy, Director of the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville.<br>  <br>  If so, I'm not really sure what you are asking.  It seems fairly clear that he accepts AGW as an overall accurate theory, though he finds faults with some of the future predictions and current findings.|`|xJS3BdUNaa	Atmospheric forecasting is done primarily through complex computer modeling using dynamical equations of fluid motion.  These models correllate the warming of the atmosphere to be dependent on increased CO2 emmissions.<br>  <br>  Anything is possible, but so far nobody has been able to create a model demonstrating the present conditions through any other means other than increased CO2 emmissions.  So negative feedback may have something to do with it, but nobody has been able to give it soild support because nothing else works as well in the models.|`|4CMENEKnaa	Stop being so Manichean.  In order for Christy to maintain some semblance of scientific credibility, he has to agree with the conclusions of the IPCC, mainly because they are correct.  However, in order to maintain credibility in his political circles, to get more publicity, and in order to save face in a big way for messing up the MSU data for so long, Christy also has to stick to the line that global warming won't be so severe.  The only way he can do this is to adopt the stance he has, namely that CO2 is warming the planet, but that the effects won't be all that bad.  Most of the "scientific" skeptics adopt this position, namely the Pelke's, Gray, and Lindzen (to some degree).  <br>  <br>  If Christy et al. are correct, they need to explain why there is no evidence that these negative feedbacks are not operating, and temperature is tracking the forcing from increasing CO2.  They need to propose a plausible mechanism by which there is a lag between the radiative forcing and the negative feedbacks.  I can't figure out what that would be, maybe they (or you) can.<br>  <br>  edit:  Being two-faced is extremely detrimental over the long run.  Christy has run his string on climate, and continued adherence to his line "the changes won't be severe" is going to cost him in the near future.  But he can't back down now and admit he is wrong.  However, unlike Lindzen and Gray, who will be dead before they are roundly ridiculed, he is young enough that he will end his career in ignominy, like the grand old geologists who argued strenuously that continents do not move.  <br>  <br>  The planet is warming, short term variability aside, that warming is accelerating (see reference below), negative feedbacks aren't going to stop that, but even if they were, the "negative feedbacks" themselves represent changes in climate, with resultant deleterious consequences for civilization.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090225/ap_on_sc/un_un_warming_antarctic">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090225/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  Edit:  Eric, see Christy's quote here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/12/18/MNGNV3PH9D1.DTL&type=printable" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...</a><br>  <br>  Sounds pretty definitive to me.  Humans are affecting climate.  Christy's position had to evolve, just as Lindzen's has.  Unlike Spencer, Christy and Lindzen have to maintain a small shred of scientific credibility.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	GCNP, like most alarmists can't see through their political biased glasses.  Christy believes that humans are a cause of the warming.  I have never heard him quoted that he thought we were the primary cause.   He doesn't believe in the predicitons of catastrophe.  I frankly don't have a problem that he thinks humans may be adding to warming particularly since it isn't quantified.  I agree with him that the problem comes from some who predict gloom and doom and particularly those that use it to push a political agenda.<br>  <br>  I don't think negative feedbacks could be responsible for warming but other factors could be such as positive feedbacks and solar, of course.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	"Plaintiffs’ own expert, Dr. Christy, agrees with the IPCC’s assessment that in the light of new evidence and taking into account remaining uncertainties, *most of the observed warming over the last fifty years is likely to have been due to the increase in GHG concentrations*.

Source below.  In response to Jim, he agreed with the IPCC conclusion that the majority (a.k.a. "most") of the warning has been anthropogenic.  That is a quantification.  If you read this, now you're aware of it.<br>  <br>  It's true that Christy believes water vapor will be a net negative feedback, and it's true he believes human CO2 emissions are responsible for most of the recent warming.  Therefore, the answer to your question according to John Christy is yes.<br>  <br>  *edit* I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're getting at.  The judge is summarizing Christy's sworn testimony in the quote provided above.  Are you accusing the judge of lying about the testimony presented in his court?  That's not really something a judge can get away with.<br>  <br>  I don't "need" Christy to agree with AGW.  The fact is that he agrees with the causes and disagrees on future warming and effects.  I said as much because it's a fact, and I have this personality defect that I like to get the facts right.  I know, some people find this hard to comprehend.

erMmZjmuaa	in an ideal situation where every one of the community is on board this is how I would begin == you have to give people a reason to bother changing their ways - by creating a new way to look at their community and seeing how going green can improve things - its more likely to succeed. but you have to go beyond the 'bandaid' of just (and yes they do help) changing lightbulbs  etc- you have to get down to the basic fundimentals and doing so with a goal helps make the change.    FIRST and formost --would be to start at the community zoning level- rezoning and changing the ground rules on local community permits, etc    as example: ALL NEW construction would be REQUIRED to have:     1)Low water use facilities or better yet no water use waste facilities (ie biolet toilets etc) high insulation, solar hot water and solar electric and a small wind turbine. ALso i would REQUIRE new construction to put in TREES (not just little mini saplings either- real trees) on each property. and rainwater harvesting systems as well.    2)NO FRONT LAWNS (major water waste and causes MANY runoff problems) Front yards of homes would be require to either have Xeriscaping or Edilble landscapes with drip water systems or planting beds  - that sort of things (Lawns would be perfectly ok for Backyards)  I would also offer Tax incentives to homeowners to Retro fit front yards for existing homes   examples:  http://www.squarefootgardening.com/  http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...  3)Go back to alley ways and off street parking. create greenbelt mini parks where bicycle paths/ walkways and fruit trees are planted instead of  asphalt  streets in front of houses.    http://www.communitygarden.org/learn/sta...    then we would go on to do the following    4) create and encourage local PUBLIC transportation - everything from Busses to things like Jeepneys and Tuk Tuks, American style    http://www.stuartxchange.org/Jeepney.htm...  http://www.tuktuknorthamerica.com/    5)Require Local Lenders to be alternative Building friendly and helpful.  create zoning regulations ENCOURAGE alternative builders to come to your community  Examples: Monolithic Domes AI, Earthshipes,    http://www.earth-house.com/    Also create programs to help Retro fit homes to higher energy efficiancy especially for elderly residents (at a very low cost)    Change Zoning to facilitate  ANY AND ALL use of things such as Solar Panels, Wind Turbines, etc in each and every household high effeciancy woodburning stoves.    6) annex the surrounding area as far as the town can and put Zoning laws into place immeadiately that will PREVENT oversized and detrimentall companies (ie walmart) to build any closer into town..  than you want - say 15-25 miles from downtown.    7) create a local Farmers Weekly Open Market for organic growers or growers that show responsible farming practices (you will have to determine what you consider responsible ahead of time)  - where all local growers that Farm responsibly can Sell locally and not have to spend the huge costs of transporting their goods. Not just fruit and veggies but meat, dairy too. In Fact in your Zoning regulations ENCOURAGE this.    8) make downtown a NO DRIVE area-- EXCEPT for public transport.. encourage locals with Horses and mules to bring their Buggies for fun and easy transportation..develop a tourist base by offering this low key green alternative.  Encourage shops in your downtown area to SHOWCASE Local Artists and Craftters.   THEY can also be part of your open Market on the weekends.    9) Offer rural homesteading programs.  if Your township/city hall owns properties that are sitting unused (ie paying no taxes) Create a way people will want to LIVE there.and make it part of the requirements of the homesteading that the house or business MUST meet "green" requirements (highly effeciant and using alternative energies)    10) Create school Garden/wildlife programs == let the schools sell their produce at the weekend markets as well. school garden programs work with curriculims and can help with school fundraising as well.    11) have a town band/orchestra - ENCOURAGE school band students to participate and have them perform on the market days.music has been proven to improve students testing in math and it encourages community involvement.    12) Waste manage zoning changes - create and Encourage a recycling center that not only takes in nearly everything that CAN be recycled - give benifits to ANY local and SMALL companies that USE the recycled materials to create New products - they in in turn can Sell them locally or to tourists. a win win all round.    13) consider becoming an "intentional community"   http://communitybuzz.ic.org/|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Look at what comes in and out of the town    "in"- water, fuel, food, power, etc. See what can be limited (reduction in waste).

Get a High-Efficiency Showerhead  A high-efficiency showerhead saves up to 3,000 gallons of water per person per year. You'll also save $50 of energy costs and 1,000 .lbs of carbon dioxide per person per year. Today's latest and greatest are specially designed to conserve resources while still feeling like a decadent showerhead. Sink aerator attachments also save major water and go for as little as $2 per sink.    2. Recycle Water in Your Bathroom  Use devices such as the Sink Positive system, which allows you to reuse sink water for flushing your toilet. Or keep a bucket by the shower or tub and fill it with the cold water that comes out before the hot water kicks in. Then you can take the bucket outside and use it to water your plants.    3. Compost  Use a composter to turn your food and lawn wastes into rich mulch. It's a great way to reduce your trash production, and the combination of food waste and all of those falling leaves is the perfect mix for composting. Next spring you'll have rich compost ready to go for spring planting.    4. Purchase Green Power from Your Utility  Most charge less than $5 per month extra. Not only will your power come from a renewable source, but you'll use the power of your spending to show utility executives and government officials that we need more investment in renewable energy projects.    5. Improve the Efficiency of Your Existing Hot Water Heater  Tankless and solar hot water heaters are great, but simple changes to your existing setup can cut your energy bills and carbon emissions by 25 percent or more. Reduce the temperature of your hot water heater to 120 degrees, wrap it in a water heater insulating blanket and insulate the first 3 to 6 feet of hot and cold water pipes. These changes should take you less than an hour and cost less than $50 to complete.    6. Use High-Efficiency Outdoor Lighting  A typical 100-watt floodlight, if used for six hours per day, can consume up to $40 of electricity over the course of a year and produce upwards of 400 pounds of CO2 depending on where you live. For starters, replace those floodlights with compact-fluorescent versions  they're just as bright and use 1/4 the energy. Next, replace low-wattage halogen landscape bulbs with LED versions. They cut energy use by over 80 percent and can last for 10 years or more. Finally, install motion sensors on any nonessential lights. New versions just screw right into your existing light socket.    7. Replace High-Use Indoor Lights with Compact Fluorescents or LEDs  Today's compact fluorescent bulbs are better than ever. No long waits to get up to full power, high-quality light, sizes for almost any fixture and even versions that are dimmable for all of those recessed lights. They're more expensive to begin with, but between energy savings and much longer lifespan they pay for themselves in less than two years. Also, consider LED bulbs for those non-dimmable circuits (especially for holiday lighting). They are true energy misers, and will last for as long as you live in your house.    8. Load Up the Washing Machines  Make sure you run dishwashers and clothes washers only when they're full. Clothes washers are huge energy and water users, so make sure you're doing full loads (or adjusting the water setting) whenever possible. And most of us use far more water (and soap) then we need to when hand-washing, especially when compared to todays' high-efficiency Energy Star dishwashers. So save your time, water and power by putting those dishes directly in the dishwasher after a meal.    9. Drive Smarter  Hybrids, biodiesels, electric - today we have more choices than ever when it comes to efficient transportation. But, some simple changes in our existing driving habits can improve fuel efficiency by up to 25%. Tips include driving at (or near!) the speed limit, keeping your tires inflated, making sure oil and air filters are clean, and stepping on the gas / brakes carefully. Driving like a drag racer may be fun, but it has a substantial environmental cost!    10. Avoid the Daily Waste of Fast Food and Shopping  Next week, keep track of how much trash you generate by eating out and making trips to the store, I guarantee you'll be amazed! All of those bags, cups, and containers really add up and are stuffing our landfills to capacity. Bring your own plastic/metal boxes to your favorite take-out joint. You'll save resources and save them money. Use reusable shopping bags whenever you go to the store. Say "No Thanks" when the pharmacist or fast food clerk tries to put your one or two items in a bag. Use reusable cups for coffee and other beverages including for soda and fountain drinks. And, reuse some of the extras at home - keep extra napkins and reuse plastic cups and cutlery.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	How about you refrain from pushing your beliefs and agendas on people who don't necessarily want to hear it. It's annoying and disrespectful to try to change other people's beliefs and ideals. If someone wants your opinion on how to be "green" they'll ask you for it.

AA10111355	I would guess than nobody has the correct answers to these questions, because no one knows for sure, but I believe I'm safe in saying that the US has been very wasteful of these resources, and at its present state of usage, will before too long exhaust the easy-to-find, cheap-to-extract reserves.  In other words, we have cooked our collective goose.|`|135b44f1244b3152e4a40148c77e1d23aa	As a global community, the fossil fuels reserves (coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) are not unlimited. One can ask a different question: how long can they last. The answer relies on the way human being choose to consume these reserves. With human population increase and our addiction to energy (the choice of live styles, comfort, etc.), without immediate refocus of energy conservation and energy efficiency improvement (not just R&D but large scale implementation of such practice and technology), we are doomed to run out of fossil fuels reserves in the coming generations. In addition, the market cost of energy from fossil fuels will becoming increasingly expensive. Eventually it will become such a major portion of our production cost, living cost that this is unsustainable for any society. This will happen way before we run out of the last drop of oil or the last truck load of coal.

AA10111355	For the same amount of light, fluorescent lites use about 1/3 the electricity as does standard lites, so this is very good for the environment, because it reduces the amount of global warming.  Anything bought in bulk costs less per unit than when purchased in smaller quantities.  Although fluorescent lites cost more, they are cheaper in the long run because they last much longer and use much less electricity.|`|svJQcrswaa	My experience is that CFLs and the newer style flourescent bulbs DO save money and do outlast incandescent bulbs by a a good bit.    So I would say yes, they do benefit the environment because they use less electricity and last longer so over time and millions of users, fewer of them are made.    There are concerns about the fact that they do contain some materials that should be recycled properly, I am afraid I don't know much about that yet, although I am checking into it.    For more details on my experience check out my source.|`|gz2JF00Saa	Very little, considering very few people will get that great of life out of them. They do consume less electricity, but it is debatable whether or not that matters.    Depends on the company, but likely less.    Again not much, since they are more harmful them selves toward to environment, and are not that great.    Now LED lights are far better for the environment than your fluorescent.    I have yet to have any compact ones last more than a year, and have yet to have any of them actually give out a good light.    Fluorescent bulbs will not help fight global warming, considering the "Global Warming" theory is not true.|`|9e0b0af2d9cc2cd634228c515cc50a4faa	CFLs contain approximately 4 milligrams of mercury each. Though 4 milligrams is a relatively small amount, the amount of mercury from the estimated 300 million CFLs sold in the U.S. since 2006 would equate to .15 metric tons of mercury! Put another way, it only takes one teaspoon of mercury to contaminate a 100-acre body of water.Best to recycle them properly. In my area I have a true value hardware that has a recycle box for them . Our local electric company also takes them .  As far as bulk price , that's hard to estimate, there are a ton of styles to choose from , but Sam's club had the largest packages of them that I have seen. also watch for sales ads. Last April ( to celebrate earth day) my Electric Co had a sale on them..bought them in a bulk then sold them at cost to anyone that wanted to make the switch.that made them very reasonable too.   The benefits are still unknown ..Yes they do use much less energy but it is feared that too many will end up in landfills.  If you do decide to make the change..Please commit to recycling them  properly..    go to   http://earth911.com     to search for recycling centers in your area    https://www.thinkgreenfromhome.com/Think...
