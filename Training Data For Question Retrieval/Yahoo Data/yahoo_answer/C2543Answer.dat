EjTikPNcaa	There is a small, triangle-shaped piece of plastic on the inside of the door, opposite where the mirror attaches.  There may be a small tweeter speaker inside.  <br>  With the door open, gently pry that triangle off and loosen the 3 screws - these hold the mirror on.  <br>  Have someone hold the mirror or prop it up so it doesn't fall and bang against your door once it's loose.  <br>  There should be a wiring harness connector.  To release, press the plastic tab on the connector - pull to separate the plugs and remove the mirror.<br>  Installation is the reverse.
A3uC9EZKaa	it depends on how much time you have, but i do not think it would take to much effort to find a better deal<br>  beware of the financers you could end paying over twice the price <br>  and dealers get bonuses for talking people into high interest loans <br>  car dealers are not honest people|`|YPHfJvuQaa	Put that money towards a well-built dependable car like a Honda Fit/Civic or a Toyota Corolla (even if you have to buy a slightly used one that is still under factory warranty). The Pontiac Vibe will prove unreliable and suffer harsh depreciation and in turn poor resale value and high maintenance/repair costs. Trust me you will be sorry buying a Vibe in the long run. I'm not sure if you have heard the news of late, but GM is going to phase out the Pontiac brand this will make it more difficult to get parts and hurt resale value even more.. Unless you can lowball this dealer to about $10k a fair price for such an automobile, look elsewhere. Good luck!|`|QcENsfCEaa	That's a fair price but do have a car fax run on it as well as have a mechanic check it out.
446092f1bf5e3d0da96bf7acd486dd56aa	In the UK, before railway privatisation and subsequent cost-cutting, track maintenance was carried out by gangs who would look after a particular length of track. The gangs, or length men as they were known, were responsible for the upkeep of their particular length of track, which could vary from a few hundred yards in multi-track areas to several miles of plain track. <br>  Maintenance today is far more automated: ultrasonic test trains check for track defects such as cracked rails, while major track renewals are carried out by Network Rail or their contractors.|`|caf12e7e979d4dcb13b87ebcb1a052c6aa	A lengthsman is or was a man who looked after a length of railway. The term has fallen rather into the past as railway companies do not  have people who look after discrete sections where they have great knowledge and skill and pride in keeping the line in good order. The rail companies think it is better to have roaming contracts which react to problems instead!!!!! which is why we have broken rails etc causing accidents|`|FgRUdQOBaa	Perhaps railway lineman?<br>  Railroads have signal lines along their tracks and the maintenance people are called linemen.<br>  <br>  later:  interesting, I had never heard that term. <br>  I learned something, my day is not wasted :-)
7wkHVaNyaa	YOu or your moms insurance should not factor in at all. The guy hit you, you should have called police, and taken down his insurance. His insurance needs to cover your costs. If went to doctor you need to tell them it was auto accident related and they will put a lean on the bill awaiting this guys info. If u didn't hit him your insurance should NEVER have been given to him. <br>  YOur mothers liability only covers her unless she has you listed.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	If her car is parked, then her insurance doesn't HAVE to cover you.  <br>  <br>  Your liability, covers the damage that your car does to other vehicles.  <br>  <br>  So, your mother's insurance isn't at fault for this, if her car was parked.  <br>  <br>  Typically, all regular operators and household members have to be listed on the policy to be covered.   Her insurance is going to require that you get added on - likely, retroactive to the date you got licensed.  <br>  <br>  If she's got liabiltiy insurance, it doesn't pay for the damage to her truck.  Period.|`|HHuS48u5aa	might ask for amount for diminished value. This is because your mom's car is worth less..<br>  <br>  They won't give it, I expect, but will be real impressed you knew to ask for it.<br>  <br>  this is to compensate for the car being hit beyond repairs.<br>  <br>  sorry about the accident.|`|LdzTP5VXaa	Did you get the other guy's info? If so just call the insurance company of the person that hit you and file for a claim. That's all you need to do you don't have to file it under your insurance.|`|AA11639480	If you only have liability, then it probably will not cover the accident.  The person hitting the parked car would be the person's insurance that would be liable for the damages.  You would normally be covered under your Mom's insurance IF she gave you permission to use the vehicle.  You should have contacted the police at the school, or if that was not done, and you know who hit you, have your Mom contact his parents concerning the damages.  Usually the insurance company will give the owner of the car a check for the damages and they pay to have them done.  So if you can do them cheaper than one of the estimates your Mom gets, I am sure you can do it.  You would be saving your Mom some money.  But the person that hit you is responsible for the damages.|`|HP0IGJ99aa	i'm going to take a guess that probably not.<br>  when i got insurance they made me give them the name of everyone in my household and excluded them from my coverage, basically no one in my house is allowed to drive my car because my insurance won't cover them in the case of an accident|`|3faz90KDaa	yes they will pay you but less than a dealer that would fix it <br>  and yes u are covered u were not driving at the time of the accident <br>  it was parked ifthe driver didnt confuse then it would be covered under your moms uninsured motorist this wont affect her rates at all|`|AA11506593	Insurance policies vary, so no one can be sure exactly what your mom's policy will or won't cover. She should call her insurance agent.|`|74bab6c1ae1e088c586807a5eec9d8beaa	i have no idea but lets hope so!<br>  good luck! :)|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	The other guys insurance would pay for the damages to your mom's car.|`|AA11914369	Insurance goes with the car, not with the driver, so if you had permission to drive her car, and are listed on her insurance as an additional driver, you're covered.<br>  <br>  But you're right, liability coverage covers things you damage.  If you have the information from the person that hit you, mom can collect from his insurance company.  You only get compensated for hit and run if you have collision coverage, so if you don't know, you're out of luck.<br>  <br>  If mom doesn't have you listed on her insurance, and you live at home, you may not be covered to drive her car.  Check with the agent to be sure if you are not on the policy.  You should have been added as soon as you became licensed.<br>  <br>  And no, you are not a legal sanctioned body shop, so you couldn't be the one to fix it.

WpqwaqcQaa	no it's not<br>  <br>  the Honda Fit is 10 times better.<br>  <br>  the yaris has a noisy engine, unsettled Hwy ride and poor brakes unless you can find and pay extra for ABS.<br>  you might get over the annoying center mounted gauges but the carnival ride at speeds over 50 mph will never get better.<br>  <br>  The Fit comes well equipped with anti lock brakes and curtain air bags. The 2009 redesign offers stability control, but only with the optional navigation system. A simpler way to fold the rear seat and a tilt and telescoping steering wheel are other improvements.<br>  <br>  Highs:  Fuel economy, handling, space utilization, cargo flexibility, crash-test results.<br>  <br>  This small four-door hatchback offers easy access and good visibility, and has an amazing amount of interior room. While not overly powerful, the Fit feels responsive, with a smooth and willing engine, and agile handling. Fuel economy is an excellent 33 mpg overall for the manual and 30 mpg for the automatic. The ride is a bit choppy but supple enough. <br>  <br>  if you opt for the sport or S version you get a bunch of options that are in today's market relatively low priced.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Yes, it's a great and cute car. =)|`|8Zcu55Braa	yes it is|`|ygGr1nX7aa	I'm a student and have a Yaris.

786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	The only thing I know is in some states tinting of the front windsheild is illegal, so I advise you to check with your local police department to see about what you can and can't do.|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	I think tinting is like tattoos for cars - it doesn't look good and it's usually on the cars of criminals, skanks and thugs. (No offense.) You need to check with your state/municipal law enforcement authorities to find what the limit is. The installers are in it for the money, so they'll install whatever you want, legal or not.

GeOMJN4Daa	I have the same truck. The biggest tire you can put on without rubbing is 30x9.5R15. You can put a body lift and fit 31-33|`|8QMvsIfKaa	I've always liked a 31 or 33 9.50 or 10.50  15 because when everyone else is spinning out they dig in because wide tires are like skis. Think about it, is a snow board 4 inches wide or 12 wide to get better flotation? If you not going to be in sand all the time I think wide tires are a waste of time.
BJERgbM5aa	Get the Nova into decent repair.  Runs great?  that's a big plus.  the vehicle is pretty good on gas?  Excellent with 6 cylinder engine.  Of course, gas performance also depends on type of roadway traffic (city or highway), & amount of miles per day.  What ever the repairs amount to, it has to be much less than buying a car.  Good Luck.|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	2 or 4 door, 2 door worth more, resale value in Canada high.
fFnsJ7maaa	The only trains that go Boston to New London and New Haven are Amtrak, but they run frequently. <br>  <br>  Regular Metro-North (the commuter rail from New York City) goes from NYC to New Haven.

wPtjtLycaa	you can try coaxing the cracks to the edge of the windshield by pressing at the tip of the crack in the direction you want it to go other than that its pretty much replace it.

KMeqvCCOaa	the 1989 didn't have a 2.6L engine... perhaps it's a 2.8L?  You could spend a lot of money on the right parts... you won't be able to simply install a turbo without addressing the engine's compression ratio, the spark timing, and the fuel delivery capability.  Trust me, if you want the car to go fast, you're better off (it's least expensive) to get a larger displacement engine.  Chevrolet had both a 305 and a 350 CID engine from the factory... and Pontiac had a 3.8L Buick engine that was turbocharged in the TurboTA...  If you want the ultimate in power, that's the way to go.  It's essentially a Grand National engine and transmission in a TransAm.  You won't be able to get most parts, because they were fairly rare, but if you can find a TurboTA, you most likely can transplant all the goodies from the TA to your Camaro.... and have a pretty fast street car.  A few more upgrades (fuel pump, injectors, chip, cold air intake, and a turbo) and you're talking some really fast strip times.. (high 11's in the 1/4 mile)|`|DAilkzubaa	You would be better off getting a bigger engine. Stepping up to a V8 will make a big difference and you could upgrade that and go even further. Your money could be better spent and do more for you if you did buy turbos and upgrades for a 2.6l.
rYeRxqJraa	Vitaly, I'm not wisest person when it comes to auto repair. Last year I had an accident with my Ford Mustang and I wasn't sure how to fix them. I tried to search the Internet for help, but the procedures were too difficult for my skills. I ended up going to the dealship for my repairs. The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations (auto insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me.

3faz90KDaa	even if the car was speeding it was still your fault Sorry<br>  the only way it would not be is if it ran a stop sign at that intersection<br>  but if u were just turn and didnt allow enough room its your fault <br>  and as far a room needed it all depends how fast u turn and get out of the way|`|BJERgbM5aa	Read 'Heathers' answer.  That's right on the money.  Your fault.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	You are at fault for failing to yield to oncoming traffic.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Because you were making a left turn without a protected signal, yes you were at fault. She is mostly at fault for speeding and/or you are also at fault for not correctly guessing how fast she was going. <br>  <br>  The distance of when to make a left turn depends on the speed of the car and the speed limit of the road. If you are in a 35 mph zone and she's going 45, she both were at fault. If you're in a 70 mph zone and she's going 70 mph, you're the one at fault.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	unless you can prove the other car was speeding i.e. a traffic camera or very reliable witnesses (i.e. not someone in your car) then you are wrong, even if she was speeding.|`|LKiVXEcCaa	your at fault cuz you didn't have the right of way... and the last question if you cant tell that you shouldn't be driving. ALWAYS ALWAYS watch others speed to make sure|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Yes.  If the other guy was going straight, and you made the left hand turn in front of them,  you are at fault for this.  <br>  <br>  The car has to be far enough off, that you clear the intersection, before they can hit you, for you not to be at fault.  <br>  <br>  There's no way they weren't "in the vicinity of the intersection".   There's a millisecond from the time you're waiting to make the turn, and the time they could have hit you.  There's not enough time, for them to <br>  then speed up and deliberately hit you in your passenger side.  It takes less than two seconds for you to clear that intersection.  You pulled out in front of the oncomong car.|`|AA11506593	This one can go either way.<br>  <br>  In theory, the person turning left must yield to all oncoming traffic. On the flip side, once a car has started to turn, any oncoming traffic must yield to allow the car to complete its turn.<br>  <br>  So the question becomes, did you turn into oncoming traffic? Or did the other car fail to allow you to complete your turn and purposely ram into you?<br>  <br>  In most instances, the insurance companies will find you to be primarily at fault.|`|2SEx4zGHaa	She had the right of way so it is your fault. Speeding or not you pulled in front of her. It's not a matter of how far away the oncoming car is, you just need to watch the oncoming cars for a second or two to judge how fast they are moving. You can tell if a car is coming too fast and wait until they pass by.|`|TQVMAZUbaa	I assume that you did not have a green arrow to turn left that would give you uncontested right-of-way to turn.  Therefore, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have enough time to safely make your turn without interfering with oncoming traffic.  <br>  <br>  If the car that struck you was speeding, you MAY be able to convince a judge that the other driver has SOME small amount of responsibility, but it's not very likely.|`|a7c44ca57676a0db1e3d8ad650499612aa	You turned in front of a car yes its your fault they have to be far enough back where they wont hit you when you turn? You cant turn in front of  a car and when they hit you say they were speeding. The car coming has the right of way. You have to always make sure you have plenty of space at least 5-6 car lengths between you.|`|HP0IGJ99aa	since you were making an unprotected left turn, yes unfortunately you will be at fault. they cop would say since they have the right of way, you should be more careful.<br>  it's unfair, i know i've been there!|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Any time you are involved in an accident you are partially at fault.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Yes , you are at fault ,|`|Hlh90tClaa	Yes you were at fault, you even said your car was hit in the middle so you didn't get that far across before you got hit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Be more careful|`|TMI3X0UPaa	yes.  failure to yield right of way|`|ExaRyk8Uaa	hard to tell, i think u were both not paying attention. its called and accident after all =PPP

TJMpKqFNaa	It's an outstanding price - almost too good to be true outstanding.  <br>  <br>  Run the VIN through CarFax yourself (don't trust a dealer's CarFax report printout because they're really easy to fake or alter) and/or take it to a trusted body shop to make sure it's never been wrecked.  If everything checks out and you want a Solstice you're not going to get a better price than that on a car that's virtually new.  Congrats.

Happens if a battery is left discharged too long.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	That's a new one on me. <br>  Desulphate, to the best of my knowledge, is what charging does to the plates inside the battery - recombining the sulfur with water to produce the electrolyte (h2so4 solution).
mWZ9BXIdaa	Use a product such as petseal or por-15 to coat the inside of the tank. If you follow the instructions to the letter it works perfectly. First you get all the loose rust possible out. Then apply a neutraliser to deal with any remaining rust. Then seal the tank with what is basically a thick paints that you swill all over inside the tank. It leaves a smooth  clean coating inside and will solve your problems.<br>  <br>  I used this kit to sort a gpz tank that has rusted from the inside out and was leaking fuel. <a href="http://www.frost.co.uk/item_Detail.asp?productID=8222&frostProductName=Motorcycle+Fuel+Tank+Repair+Kit&catID=25&subCatID=&FrostCat=Tanks&FrostSubcat=" rel="nofollow">http://www.frost.co.uk/item_Detail.asp?p...</a>|`|xnsoQzInaa	There is a product for metal tanks called Kreem it comes as a three part cycle.

NlYGbqnkaa	What won't they do? Is it a car problem or a difference in the money. I work at a dealership and when someone gets a lawyer everything I could've done for them stops and we let the lawyers figure it out. The best bet is to be nice and rational go in the dealership sit down with the owner or the General Manager and explain the problem. 99 out of a 100 times they will work out the problem with you. They don't want unhappy people anymore then you want to be unhappy. If you go to a lawyer you might win... but it will take a long time.

There is no inbetween.|`|mCbhjcLuaa	Dodge Ram SRT10|`|AA12040660	Ford sells more BUY Chevys are more reliable.More Chevys are STILL on the road than Fords even though MANY more Fords were bought.

HXvX20XAaa	I had the same problem with my projectors on my celica. I took the black wires and grounded them. To ground the negative wires just use a factory bolt and bolt them down to the metal and make sure its bolted to bare metal not painted metal. Then with the positives you have to splice into one of the green wires coming out of the factory light wire harness. The best way to do it is to get 2 little plastic crimp clamps. You put the positive wires in it then you clamp it onto the green wire, which is the "hot" wire. When you clamp it to that wire the metal piece in the clamp actually splices into the green wire connecting the 3 wires. Just do that on both lights and you should be good to go. Good luck

AA10789216	Yes, you can add oil while the engine is running, but you can't check the oil level with the engine running, unlike automatic transmissions where you check them in park with the engine idling. <br>  <br>  Just be careful to not get tangled in the belts.  It's just safer to shut off the engine when working on it.|`|1SnI86BIaa	why dont you put oil in it before you start it?<br>  <br>  is it soo hard?<br>  <br>  but i guess you could, if you really wanted to, but its just gonna splash right back at you..|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Not a good idea.  Oil is supposed to be under pressure while your engine is running!  So when you open it up to add the oil, the pressure will shoot oil out all over the engine.<br>  <br>  Also, the statement "uses up oil" is evidence that something is wrong with your car.  Cars should "use" very little (if they were perfect, no) oil.  The fact that it is going through it fast means problems.  And it will only get worse if you don't try to do something about it, if anything can be done.  I had an '87 Civic like that, once it started burning oil it was the beginning of the end.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	Check you engine for oil leaks. First, powr wash the engine at a do-it-yourself car wash. Sometimes, the valve cover gasket on these engines leak a little with age. Make sure there are no oil leaks, and then begin using a good synthetic oil, if you haven't been. Honda requires the use of an oil that meets a certain ASEA rating. Read your owner's manual!!!!!|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you can but you won,t be able to tell how much. it,s best to check it before starting it and on the level then if it,s low fill it up. if you put too much in then you will have a chance of blowing a seal or gasket.|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	if you can run fast enough to catch it|`|XlmvIBiAaa	Yes, putting in oil while the car is running should not hurt anything. I have done it numerous times.  Also, if you are using that much oil, you may want to check for a leak because that is a lot of oil to be replacing.  Unless your car is putting out a huge smoke screen when you drive down the road, it is difficult to believe that you are burning that much oil without a leak somewhere.  Good luck!!|`|8c93b08d0ef73b87abf803c1344c16e1aa	Sure. Just be careful not to touch any hot metal and watch out for moving parts. It's radiator fluid (antifreeze) that you don't want to fool with except when the engine is cool/cold.<br>      At 19 years of age, your Civic is probably just burning oil - not leaking it, right? In that case, keep a couple of bottles in the car and keep on truckin'!|`|ieDarpkVaa	Of course you can. I do it all the time, and nothing happens to me. Also, if you want your car running smoothly, you might want to add sme whisky or other hard liquir to the mix.

If your payment history has been spotless, then you shouldn't have problems.<br>  <br>  Do you have proof of all payments made, and were you current at the time of repossession? If so, I STRONGLY recommend speaking to an attorney to see what options you have. Perhaps, as one respondent suggested, someone was embezzling, and you were caught in it. In that case, you may have grounds to sue, as well as suspected criminal activity that should be reported to law enforcement.<br>  <br>  Regardless of whether you've been up on your payments, you're still responsible for the balance of the loan after the car has been auctioned off and the proceeds of the sale applied to the outstanding balance.|`|35ccd6787396d28df477a92fd029614caa	first if you have proof you been making payments and they just came and reposed your car that's wrong. i would get a lawyer bring your receipts and sue the hell out of the car dealer see how they like you then.|`|b3e84b9579e9f3c8f36fd3f2affca04baa	You are going to have to pay the balance off.  Generally, you won't pay the full balance, but they will want whatever you are behind on and maybe a little more.  You should call the bank who the loan is through.  Now that they have the car, you aren't responsible for anything else, if you don't want to be.  Basically if you don't pay off a car, they come get it.  This WILL go on your credit for at least 7 years, and a car repossession will look really bad and will keep you from getting home, car, and other loans, plus credit cards.  All that said, you really need to call the bank ASAP.  Best of luck!

XcWiPkVjaa	CHECK FUEL PRESSURE AT THE CSI UNIT.  IF THE FUEL PRESSURE IS LOW CHECK THE FUEL FILTER . IT IS UNDER THE CAR NEAR THE GAS TANK AND IT LOOKS LIKE AN ALUMINUM CAN. IT COULD BE DIRTY AND RESTRICTED. OR IF THE CAR HAS ALOT OF MILEAGE YOU COULD HAVE AN ELECTRIC FUEL PUMP GETTING WEAK.  IF FUEL  PRESSURE IS GOOD, THEN GO MORE TOWARDS THE IGNITION MODULE.   IN SHORT,  4 THINGS CAN CAUSE THIS SYMPTOM: FUEL PRESSURE TOO LOW, IGNITION MODULE AND PICK-UP SENSOR, RESTRICTED EXHAUST SYSTEM LIKE COLLASPED PIPE OR CAT CONVERTER RESTRICTED, AND IGNITION SWITCH (THE ONE INTEGRATED WITH IGNITION KEY) THE IGNITION SWITCH CAN OVERHEAT FROM A BAD CONNECTION AND WHEN HOT IT SENDS LESS VOLTAGE TO SYSTEM AND ENGINE SURGES AND STALLS.  ALSO THESE ARE IN THE ORDER THAT YOU SHOULD CHECK FIRST. IN OTHER WORDS THE FUEL SYSTEM IS MOST LIKELY TO BE YOUR PROBLEM, AND THE IGNITION SWITCH IS THE LEAST.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	I agree with the above post suggesting the fuel pressure may be the problem here.

Jerking back and forth is usually not the torque converter.  This sounds more like a misfire.  <br>  <br>  But if the torque converter is not allowed to unlock when coming to a stop, it can stall the engine.  The torque converter should release if the brake is applied.  If you drive on the freeway, steady cruising, and very gently tap the brakes just enough to turn on the brake lights, you should notice the tachometer go up slightly as the torque converter releases.  Then the RPMs will go back down when it re-engages.  <br>  <br>  Have you changed the transmission fluid every year?  Neglect is the number one reason for transmission failure.

How about engine tune. Torque converter repair is not every shops job. The converter has to be chucked in a lathe and cut open.

The transmission and torque converter are almost always replaced as a set not one or the other.<br>  <br>  I would recommend the following;<br>  <br>  Have the transmission fluid level checked.  Any auto parts place guy will be happy to help and they are not motivated to sell you repair work or parts so you will most likely get the truth.  Some place like Auto Zone.  Ask if he thinks the fluid looks and smells OK.  <br>  FREE So far<br>  <br>  Hopefully it is low and looks and smells OK if so add the proper fluid $3 to $5 at this point and cross your fingers.<br>  <br>  If it is not low or smells (smells burnt) or looks bad (dark and or not clear) find a reputable repair shop and ask to have the transmission inspected and serviced could be $50 or as much as $100.  Be very careful this is where the opportunity to get ripped off happens, there are a lot of shops that will report the need for a new transmission to get the work.  Do not have a 10 min lube place do this because this is your change to have an experiences person look the thing over.  It is possible that flushing the thing out and having new fluid will fix the problem and it is way cheaper than replacing the trany.<br>  <br>  If non of the above fix the problem it will be over $1000 but should be under $2000 for a rebuilt replacement transmission installed.  There is an option of having a salvage yard trans put in but that is risky and will still be $500 or more to buy and have installed.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some one mentioned about a miss fire, good point it could be that.  The engine may not be running smooth.  So if it jerks a little when you give it a little gas and jerks a lot when you give it a lot of gas at slow speeds it could be as simple as a fouled spark plug.  That would only be $50 or less to have some one fix.

SuZbBnycaa	When you pay a car off, one of two things occur. <br>  1. The lender tells the DMV the loan was paid and provides you with a "clean" title      or<br>  2. The lender gives you the title with their signature, stamp and notary showing the loan has been satisfied. Then YOU need to tell the DMV and apply for a "clean" title. <br>  <br>  Someone needs to tell the DMV. You or the Lender. It doesn't matter who. But as far as the DMV records show, you still have a lien. Right now only you know and the lender know. In fact your registration probably also shows the lien holders name, right?<br>  <br>  If the lender went out of business, the DMV or AAA Auto Club have a list of financial "bought out" instiutions.

d05a7a6b98fce996f5af07c7de6a5c55aa	Your check engine light can be turned on for any of a couple hundred reasons. The computer monitors dozens of input sensors, and can set multiple codes for each of those sensors. In order to determine the cause, the codes have to be "read" by some type of scanner. Different types of scanners check for codes in different areas of the computer. Most parts stores have "generic" scanners, which can only access some of those codes. This is why places like Auto Zone will check them for free, where as a reliable shop typically charges for this. Most shops start by charging around $30 - $60. Keep in mind, whichever way you go the code(s) found are NOT a diagnosis. Usually there needs to be some time spent to verify the problem. That being said... If your light comes on after start up, and goes out after a bit, knowing Subaru's... my first guess would be that you have an ignition coil pack going bad. You will probably find a misfire code or codes. If your light comes on and begins flashing, it means that it is detecting a severe misfire, which if left unrepaired, can cause damage to your catalytic converter. Just remember that this is just a guess. I'd be interested in hearing what the problem was once you get it taken care of. Good luck, hope my info was helpful.|`|AA10331789	<a href="http://www.samarins.com/diagnose/checkengine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.samarins.com/diagnose/checken...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.troublecodes.net/articles/myth-conception.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.troublecodes.net/articles/myt...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/maintenance/MaintenanceServlet" rel="nofollow">http://www.edmunds.com/maintenance/Maint...</a>

Good luck!|`|SfludeD5aa	try to find a chevy or dodge, they are easy to work on and most parts are cheap and easy to get. Pay the money to take it to a mechanic BEFORE you put any money down on it. And if the person won't let you do that then RUN or if they want to use THEIR mechanic RUN!|`|46eoAIGZaa	The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is run a Carfax on the vehicle before any purchases.  This will tell you if the car has a salvaged title or has been in any wreck with major work needing to be done.  It will also tell you how many registered owners have had this vehicle.  After that check the nuts and bolts that are in the area of the hood.  If they are stripped of paint that also will tell you that body work has been done or at least a paint job has also been done.  Check under the vehicle for any kind of leaks too.  I'm not a mechanic so I couldn't tell you what each color fluid is, but the only one that isn't the biggest issue is typically the clear fluid- due to the fact that is usually just water that comes off the a/c- you'll see that more in the summer time.  If possible try to have a mechanic look at it before the purchase of the vehicle and if it was at a dealership, they should have done at least a 50 point inspection before the attempt of sale.  Have a look at the paperwork and it will tell you any work they may or may not have done on the vehicle (like an oil change, trans flush, etc).  Hope that helps a little bit.|`|LTlx22njaa	Toyota for the amount you want to spend would probably be best.

RT8VHWRtaa	You can always try partsforchinesescooters.com I am not familiar with that make/model but I am sure you will be able to get the engine parts. Most Chinese scooters of that size use one of two engines. You can find which engine you bike uses by looking at the engine case, there will be a milled flat spot with a bunch of letters and numbers etched in. This should be your engine number. Write that down, the first several numbers and letters will be your engine type. Examples are: GY6, QM139, QJ139 etc. After you have found your engine type, search the internet by engine type. When buying engine specific parts make and manufacturer are not as important as what kind of engine you have. Good luck|`|q0x8NQfdaa	Help us to help u.<br>  WHAT'S THE WEBSITE!!<br>  translation available...otherwise seems to be limited spares (see one guy got his engine replaced through dist. though).
g6easyBFaa	The rotors have ring-gears mounted in them which rides on a fixed gear on the side housings. This ensures the rotor only spins the proper direction. <br>  <br>   The hole in the rotor is mounted onto an eccentric lobe on the eccentric/crankshaft.

VEIkVDtIaa	it still could be the gas cap.  if the gas cap was loose and you tightened it then it will take two 'trips' for the onboard system to recognize that the "problem" ahs been "fixed".  A trip isn't just getting in the car and driving it; a trip means the car is started cold and driven for over 20 minutes during which time the coolant temperature has to rise and the vehicle speed has to go above 50 mph.  Its quite possible that it may take a week for the system to test the evap system twice and turn the light out.<br>  <br>  if the gas cap seal is good it could be the one-way valve or a clogged breather for the canister.  both of those are remote possibilities as the P1457 is almost always a loose gas cap.<br>  <br>  tighten the cap 3 clicks and give it a week to test the system and turn the light out.  if the light doesn't go out after a week then look for other causes.<br>  <br>  hope that helps

AA10788612	I can only tell you my experience. <br>  I had a 2001 Ram 2500, 2wd, diesel, & a 5 spd manual.<br>  It had 100K miles on it when I sold it 5.5 yrs later.<br>  Only the lift pump that supplied fuel to the injectors died on me.<br>  It cost me $600 to replace at the dealer. <br>  I am looking for another Cummins powered truck.<br>  Finding a good used one is hard b/c they are good trucks & people keep them. I guess that says alot.<br>  <br>  Edit note: Gas powered one do have less than average resale. But the diesels do not. In fact I think dollar for dollar, they are better than Ford & GM in terms of diesel powered resale values.|`|DAilkzubaa	98.5-02 had a VP-44 electric injector pump and it is very prone to failure because it is lubricated by diesel which has almost all of the lubricative sulphur taken out of it, requiring fuel additives like 2 stroke oil or fuel lubricants to be added, an aftermarket liftpump like an Airdog or FASS, and a fuel pressure gauge to show when fuel pressure was dangerously and damagingly low. A 12 valve from a prior year with a Southbend DD clutch will not fail you. Southbend and Valair are the biggest and most reputable names for aftermarket tough high torque clutches for diesels and Southbend is the better of the two. Not so much that if you could save money that you could get the cheaper one and it wont be that much, if any, worse. The newer 6.7 has horrible reliablility because of the EGR and DPF. Two things that people remove allowing the truck to run better but in doing so, voids the factory warranty and can bring harsh EPA violation fines. 89-93 is first gen and 94-98 is second gen 12 valve with 98.5-02 being 2nd gen 24 valve. The 2nd gen 12 valve has a P7100 in line injector pump that flows more fuel than the earlier VE pump. Both can be turned up, making the driving experience completely different.|`|qjg0g5WMaa	well yes the diesel has trans problems seen a lot of this also wiring issues but my suggestion is buy want you like after all you will have to live with it i owned a 2005 dodge 4 door daully  diesel 2 trans  constantly in shop (wiring injectors a/c issues seat stopped working windows stopped working steering pump went bad 25.000 miles constant oil leaks) i may have just bought a lemon but 2 transmissions in 60,000 miles and i didn't use it for towing look at ford or chevy i did and my duramax has been trouble free for 60,000 miles but all american trucks are good trucks <br>  good luck|`|4KvLIa6Saa	We have 3 2005 dodge Rams 2 diesels and a 1500> Ordering a new Diesel next week> The only problem we have is the fords won't get out of a our way> But we do past them as there Always at the fuel station>All autos and pull race car trailers 13k And boats 12k> manuel trans are  PAIN> shifting and clutching> Unless your into that kind of work> Just My thought a proud Dodge ram owner>|`|jsXFeFQkaa	dodge dakotas are awsome. ford is junk and so is gm products. we own a transmission shop and we never get dodge is here that often we have more gm and chevy and ford in here than anything|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Where did you hear this about Dodge trucks??

e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Well, before you can register it for road use, you usually have to have the title switched for a rebuilt title.  Also, keep in mind, once the car has a salvage or rebuilt title, it's only worth HALF of what it would be worth, if it hadn't been a total loss.  <br>  <br>  Most insurance companies won't give you collision or theft coverage on a car with a salvage or rebuilt title.

v8TWvtQgaa	Man, stop watching ricer movies. Stick shifts are slower than autos in a drag race.<br>  <br>  98% of drag racers run and recommend an auto trans, not a stick shift. <br>  <br>  I'm one of them.  I'm 27 years old, been drag racing at track since I was 15 (yes back then a 15 year could race a car) <br>  <br>  Right now I run a 1988 camaro in NHRA D.O.T tire class. I have a 355, old combo had 505 HP, ran 11.40's @ 118 mph in 1/4 mile, 1.60's 60' times pulling front wheels on launch.  New combo should have 590 HP and make it well into the 10's <br>  <br>  Wanna guess what transmission I run?  Th-400 auto, transgo reprograming kit, 9.5" 3500 stall torque converter, B&M govenor recal kit, shift points set for 6400 rpm <br>  <br>  Stick shifts will be slower in a drag race due to amount of time it takes to shift gears, clutch slippage, and alot harder to launch w/o wheel spin and to launch same way every pass, after pass, after pass. <br>  <br>  Dont help much if you pull out a 11.20 on this pass, make it to next round and launch 200 rpm higher, spin the tires for 15 feet and run a 11.25.. Your going home<br>  <br>  Also on anything with real power, everything happens too quick to think about shifting.. Sure I know, I know you can do it, or atleast you think you can. <br>  <br>  Let me share alittle info from my data logger with you as far as how quick stuff happens. <br>  <br>  I have my trans set up to shift at 6400 rpm which is where I need it to shift. <br>  <br>  Foot break, against converter, 2800 rpm launch to shift point in  1.786 seconds and at that time I'm already at 45.55 mph and 70 feet down the track. <br>  <br>  0-60mph  in 2.874 seonds and 156 feet down the track at that point. <br>  <br>  My 2-3 gear shift happens at 3.766 seconds after launch,  I'm at 70.38 mph and 242 feet out.  (thats only 1.98 seconds after I make the 1-2 shift) <br>  <br>  And keep in mind thats spinning engine up to 6400 rpm on shifts  <br>  <br>  Heck I go from 60 feet to 70 feet out in 0.153 seconds  and in that same spae rpm goes from 6118 to 6400.. <br>  <br>  Point being, miss a shift even by 2/10th of 1 second and you could wrap the tach, and drive right over your crank and rods thats now laying on the track <br>  <br>  <br>  Plus most auto transmissions are stronger than man. trans and clutches. <br>  <br>  The third gen camaros had a brog warner T5, 5 speed man transmission.. Do alittle search on those  lmao.  Stock 160 HP 305's are breaking third gen in those weak toys of a transmission <br>  <br>  If you want a stick shift that can hold up to drag racing, your looking at $2500 for the trans, clutch and bell. <br>  <br>  Run an auto and save the money to go toward a good rear end cause you WILL break your stock ones. The stock ones are weak and I have went through two of them myself, untill I spent out the 2 grand for a ford 9" rear|`|dQrBlk4qaa	I'll be the fourth person talking you out of it - keep the automatic, and add the appropriate performance parts. You will net a lot more consistency on the track with an automatic - however, be aware that the automatics in the early to mid-third gen camaros are weak dogs, and will need some performance innards to get them to not vomit their bits on the track. Do that and install the transbrake, and you're ready to rock. <br>  <br>  You can use used parts if you do still want to move to a stick - the best thing to do is find a trashed stick shift third gen car, and obtain the pedal assembly, trans, center console and the associated parts. Most of your cost will be in the junkyard cost of these parts, which shouldn't set you much under 600-800 bucks (we're talking usable trans - makes the price go up a little!). While you may not be able to do the trans work yourself, you can most certainly do the pedal assembly transplant in a driveway in an afternoon.|`|IE5C4zoNaa	well to be honest if ur gonna drag race it i would recomend u leave it automatic i have been drag racing for years and have ran both manualy and autos i prefer the auto for racing for a few reasons for 1 consistancy u are way more consistant with very minamul mistakes but with a manual its very easy to mess up u can also run a trans brake wich will give u a much better start and its safer and easier on the car and parts them selves but if ur down and determned to run a manual i have converted a 84 camaro all i did was went to the junkyard and bout a factory 5 speed camaro for $150 it didnt have a motor or any drive train really and just swapped everything out from it into mine then sold what parts i didnt use back to the junk yard just do it 1 piece at a time then u know how it goes back together and it doesnt matter if its a v6 or v8 the clutch setup is the same hope this helps|`|LsG8CbABaa	Not too bad, depending where ya go, maybe a couple hundred. But in drag strips, automatics are favored because if you're serious, you can't shift fast enough to win....especially if you're up against a big bad guy next to ya. Manuals are better for cruisin around town showin off, but the drag strip? Automatic......save your money.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	I would think not counting the transmission about $100 for parts and $200 for labor.  But the automatics are faster in the faster classes.
AA11652304	This Nissan engine has the lifters in the end of the rockers and are expensive to buy and awkward to fit. Changing the oil and filter may fix the problem as well, use the correct oil too. Try some 'lifter free' in the old oil for a couple of days before you change it.<br>  <br>  The bad areas for oil leaks are the rear main seal, front seal, valve cover and oil pressure switch. <br>  <br>  These were very good engines in their day but at 21 years old it could be getting tired|`|PlQ4N2Hxaa	I don't know about this particular engine, but if you lifters are clacking you can generally take off the valve covers and lightly tighten the nut holding on your rockers.<br>  <br>  Gasket leaking happens.  Age causes them to dry out and leak, over tightening causes them to get pinched which also causes leaking.  If you have oil coming from the drain plug try a little oil proof Teflon tape around the plug threads.<br>  <br>  Check all gasket locations to see if oil is coming from them, as an alternative also check your oil pressure gauge hose.  A lot of times they use crappy plastic tubing that becomes brittle and breaks thus becoming an oil spewing hole.

WpqwaqcQaa	that's not cheap<br>  <br>  these cars sell for between $5,800 & $9,500<br>  <br>  read a view owner reviews:<br>  <br>  First and foremost, the interior is a major disappointment. The dash is cracked in over 6 places and a giant piece just flops loosely because it completely separated. The plastic used is SO cheap and flimsy I can hardly believe Mitsubishi allowed this sub-par junk to be allowed in the car. My cig lighter shorted out and I had to remove it. A seal for my AC drain deteriorated and the condensation leaked into my car---love the rust. My lock fell out of my glove box--though I put it back in and it's held. The water drains under the hatch plugged up and if the car is parked facing downhill it leaks water inside when it rains. My headlight receptacles burnt up because the wires were too small.<br>  <br>  It lacks interior leather, especially on the doors.There is a lot of cheap plastic in it.The room in the back seat is small good for kids, but thats it.The gas cap is plastic too and should have been metal.The ECU = the cars computer will not accept any kind of moddifications done to engine in almost any way.You try and change something like the air intake, the ECU sees the prob. and corrects it making your upgrade useless.So if your looking for a car to modify on engine upgrades this is not it. Also I had to replace my tranny with only 48k on the car.Covered thank goodness by warranty.Tranny heats up to easily because of the placement of exhaust under tranny.Bad location.<br>  <br>  I have had several problems with my car. I have had it fixed 3 times in the last 6 months & now it's making other noises. The parts are so expensive, also. One part cost me $300<br>  <br>  Original tires lost traction on wet superhighway (with 12K miles on them) - spun 540 degrees - replaced with tires with higher wet traction rating and no problems since. Driver side winshield wiper loosened and stopped (after 3 years) during very heavy rainstorm on superhighway - created very unsafe situation (unable to see). Had to replace front disc rotors because they were too thin - the first time I replaced front brake pads(unexpected). Dents in rear quarter panel (caused by others slamming their parked car doors into it)is costly to repair because of convertible mechanism behind the panel (i.e., unreachable from behind). Don't expect a lot of room in backseat/trunk.|`|vjVnpXcnaa	Well the more millage on the car the less its worth, also, I'm sure its a used car.

Mitsubishi has improved a lot, especially with their Lancers and Lancer Evolutions.<br>  <br>  This car, including the transport will be around 11,000? With 9,000 more (which is a lot but really if you compare a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse with a 2009 Eclipse...) I think it's a lot better to get the new one..<br>  <br>  Or go to a used car dealership and look for a 2008 Eclipse, which would be a lot lower.

That's dropping right into the danger zone for s*** going wrong. Also that's not inexpensive. You could pick up a used 7-series Beemer for that cash and that'd be more worth your while. You're better off getting the more dependable, more fun-to-drive Mazda Miata. You'll probably find it cheaper as well.|`|TbiSBXclaa	it's not inexpensive at all. $10,000 for an 8 year old Eclipse with almost 100K miles is way to much.  That car is only worth about $7500.   The Autotrader average for that car is just $7900<br>  <br>  Carmax overcharges for everything.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Maybe because it has 90 k miles on it|`|qov5T21Daa	that's a fair price and because it has 90K miles, 8 yrs old and its beyond any factory warranty  A new GT is about 20-22K, so its reasonable for this to be half the price with 90K miles on it and avg miles per year was is 12,500miles. So that's decent/normal driving usage. The only thing is how would you know if it is mechanically sound before you purchase, check out local used cars first where you can assess if the car is mechanically sound. although they do offer 5 day money back guarantee, it would just save the hassle of any return process if you didn't like it or found hidden problems.|`|RDcwT7YEaa	They need to move cars now.

Carmax isn't going to tell you. There is just something magical about a car when it reaches 100K miles & they literally fall apart.

5295ce0578e5f91d2c73b820d4289eceaa	You don't use a fuse between the alternator and battery unless there was one from the factory then you would still use the same size. You use a fuse between the battery and the amp. For an amp that draws 120A, I would use a 150A breaker instead of a fuse. When upgrading the Big 3 you simply need to increase the size of the wires that were used from the factory.

By digital clock, do you mean the one on the stereo, or the car?    You'll have to take your stereo out, and fasten the loose wire connections.    It cant be a fuse, when a fuse blows it goes out, thats it, it doesnt flicker on and off.    Its not an alternator, its not your battery.    ----    Take out your stereo.  Find the Black wire(ground wire), check to make sure you have a solid ground connection, and the wire is connected tightly everywhere.    Then check your Red wire(power wire), check everything again.    Then check any Yellow Wires. Sometimes this is the Power wire on Some stereos....but usually not. But check it anyways.  If the wire isnt connected to anything, thats fine.  If it has a poor connection or not tied or crimped correctly, just fix it.    Also, if your running any subs or amps, check all BLUE wires.  If you lose connection to these wires, it can cause your sound to completely cut out, and occassionally cause power flickering if the stereo has a safety intterupt device built in to it!
b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Its common with even newer ABS especially when the tires are worn. I know that my best friend's 05 accord would do that after he wore the hell out of his tires.   Most trucks have this problem since the rear tires have such less weight on them, they will vibrate like you are experiencing but much more violent. I experienced it in a 06 F-250 the other day.   Whats happening is that your car is sensing that your front and back wheels are not turning at the same speed, and so it assumes that you are slipping. If they move at the same speed the abs will not come on, that includes if all of your wheels lock up at the same time. If they do not, then you will experience the vibration, which is the ABS opening and closing the brakes.   There are really only two things you can do, drive a little more cautiously, and if you tires are worn, replace them. It will make a huge difference in the snow.|`|d5ec0d14b20f77a346c8dcc04807a042aa	is possible ur brakes need changed the grinding suggests u should do it soon. if u r not sure just go get an inspection done like u would to get car legal, in missouri is like $12, for peace of mind that is what I would do.|`|nYgUfUd7aa	It is normal to feel a "vibration" in the pedal as the brakes rapidly cycle.

gEw83TRTaa	I wouldnt buy a car made by someone who was illiterate.    And what is the damn fascination with the SOUND of the car?

I want it to behave the way I feel a car should behave in my driving conditions.  I dont care if it sounds like a wasp in a coffee can, or the 1812 Overture.    There are some good Kit Cars out there - Factory 5 makes some of the best AC Cobra replicas on the market.  But every Ferrari/Lamoborghini kit that I have ever run across is total crap.  A re-bodied, re-badged Corvette, Mustang or Fiero - yes Fiero.      EDIT:  OK - here is it.  First, you dont have 20 yrs of mechanic experience.  I've read the rest of your Q&A.  I am saying you are 20's at the outside.  Handing your dad a wrench when you are 6 doesn't count as mechanical experience.    Second, I hope my mechanic knows how to spell critical things like 'suspension' and is not an 'amateur' under the hood.  Knowing what they are, and how to look up parts will be important since they will need to be 'bought' before installed.    Last - As we have said, there is alreadys a plethora of poorly-made kits on the road.  You can't build and market a decent car for under 10,000.  Not as a single builder.

Some actually can be built with powerful engines and good suspensions, too.     For a direct answer, no. I drive performance cars for their performance, not their appearance. I prefer "sleeper" cars- ones that appear normal. but are actually highly modified.

The transmissions were built with syncronizers that allow you to shift without the clutch.  It was most commonly used for racing!  The life of the transmission will decrease if it is abused.  It isn't something you should do all the time.  So yes it is possible.  And yes it can damage the transmission over time if it is abused.
AA11404742	It depends on the skill of the shop that fixes it.  If the frame was bent, it can be harder to get it to track truly straight.  But if it's just sheet metal damage, that can be repaired.    Your friend should take the car to a reputable shop, rather than whoever gives him the cheapest estimate.  And your friend should ask for referrals from the shop, and to people who had similar major damage done to their car.  He wants to know how well they did, and how long ago.  If the damage was done a year or more, and the car drives well, and doesn't wear tires off in a hurry, that's a good sign that it's tracking straight, and the repair was done well.|`|SkMjo0fNaa	What does "destroyed" mean? I can't say if the engine will be the same unless I get a better idea of how bad it is. Rebuilt engines can be better than new or horrible, it really depends on the shop. If it's really destroyed then insurance will total it out and he'll go buy a new one. It only take 75% of the car's value worth of damages to get a car totalled out.|`|GGf7PrI7aa	If your friend takes the car to a reputable shop and has professionals repair it, he should have no problems that cannot be corrected.

TBhpNNYRaa	what you'd first want to do is get as much of the dent out as you can, rule of thumb is try not to spread filler more than 1/8" thick to prevent cracking.  if it's a little thicker it'll be ok.  I like Evercoat Rage and Rage Extreme.  Rage is a little thicker so it's nicer to cover bigger dents where as Rage Extreme is slightly thiner but sands easier.  a gallon of each is around $35.  after that i'd put some Evercoat Metal Glaze to fill any pinholes in the base filler.  To prevent cracking as well make sure there is no rust on the metal and that it is cleaned off properly with like a wax and grease remover.  Make sure that you grind the metal a little before putting the filler on to make sure it has a nice tooth to stick to. Hope this helps :)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i use bondo and i,am happy with it. it goes on good and easy to sand.|`|AA12191445	get as much of the dent pushed or pulled out as possible.( Pulled, with a slide hammer, or if one is not available drill some small holes and make a hook from some stiff wire and use that to pull with) You will have to grind the area clean of all paint, But to your question, i have used many brands, and prefer Dynalite which i believe is available at O' Rielleys. The small holes will allow some filler to run in and hook over( like bending a nail over after you drive it in) and make the patch hold better

If the punto's engine code is 188A7 the comression ratios are the same so i'd bet the internals are exactly the same too. The punto engine code 188A2 has slighlty lower compression at 18.45 vs 18.5 which results in a 5bhp deficit. <br>  <br>  Make of this what you will but i don't think it would be a problem.

cViFUALzaa	thermostats are fairly standard for all makes, find the bell housing for the thermostat, its usually on the engine attached with two or three bolts. once you found it, drain the coolant, remove the thermostat housing, scrape off the old gasket with a blade scraper tool, install new thermostat, make sure the thermostat is the correct temperature range and that the spring faces towards the engine., do not be tempted to install a "cold" thermostat. coat the new gasket with gasket dressing and re attach the housing, make sure to torque all bolts to specified torque, if you do not have a torque wrench, just torque down until gasket dressing starts to just be squeezed out. I recommend waiting overnight to let the gasket sealant cure, but you can fill the system up rigth away if in a hurry. check for leaks .
km9cQNAXaa	No.<br>  <br>  Remember though it's tough. For every potential pilot accepted for training the RAF has around 500 volunteers. Even if you can get yourself accepted only about 30% of those who begin training actually graduate. Among fast jet pilots the chances are even less.

7qCUk8hfaa	i love my honda i will never buy american if i did it would be a ford GM suck!!!!!!|`|Rwn0svq0aa	I think you have to look at the naked truth in the question you raised. In this climate, warranty's are a gimmick. Car companies do not honor warranties as advertised because they are broke. The automakers want you to buy.  What makes me nervous about the purchase of an American car is the morale of the people who are on the assembly lines.  Do they care what and how they are building their cars?  Is their a pride in their behalf to make the best product, or is the corporate priority more of a desperation to move inventory by any means necessary?  <br>  I believe American car makers can build a car that is worth purchasing. I also believe a great deal and value can be attained by a customer who does their homework. Of the three American brands, my greatest hesitation would be Chrysler, though a sentimental favorite, I am not convinced that Cerebus has enhanced the Chrysler brand.  Ford gets it and GM gets it....now.  If I had to choose between Ford and GM, I have always favored GM over Ford products, but I would equally consider both brands alongside any car maker. I think the American car companies have earned our recent consideration, instead of 70's, 80's criticisms becoming the final word.|`|bQpIctgPaa	I wouldn't call it apprehension.  Rather, lack of desire to buy one.  Any time I've shopped for a car, an import appealed to me more for a variety of reasons.  I've purchased new three Honda's and one VW.  Today, I've got one more reason not to buy from one of the big three.  Their bailout is my money and my children's money I didn't choose to spend on them, so any money I do choose to spend will definitely go elsewhere.  I've done well with Honda's (mostly made in the U.S. by the way) so I'll stick with a good thing.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	Chrysler will not make it out of this year.  MOPAR is hurting pretty bad in general (Dodge and Jeep too).<br>  <br>  GM will most likely get bought out and someone will be honoring the warranty, most likely will be Toyota.  However if nobody buys it out, there warranties will be completely void via bankruptsy.<br>  <br>  I'm very apprehensive about buying an American Car.  I don't think any of them are going to make it as long as the Autoworkers Union exists.  Ford is in the best shape, but I wouldn't buy an American Car until the union goes away and they're in better shape.  Unless I didn't really care about money, then that's another issue.  <br>  <br>  Still, the cars are absolute crap, so it doesn't really matter anyhow.  There are maybe 2 cars I would consider buying that are US produced at the moment.  The designs are flawed, the styling is up to a decade behind the competition, the reliability isn't there...  I know there are those employees and family members that will say that it's a media conspiracy and that American Cars are every bit as reliable as the Japs, but that's just ridiculous IMO.  Look at the warranty claims, reliability ratings, and having owned both there really is no contest.  Toyota, Honda, and Nissan are far superior build quality and styling to Ford, GM, or Mopar, hands down.  Until the prices reflect an inferior product, there's absolutely zero logical reason to buy American past blind brand loyalty and nievity over the propaganda.|`|lcchJUuCaa	maybe if GM stopped making there vehicles in Mexico and Canada and only made them in the U.S then we wouldnt have to worry about this and people losing there jobs.<br>  <br>  but no im not apprehensive because if we don't keep buying American cars then they will go bankrupt

Expect to pay more as I suspect he is a teenager, part of the group with a high rate of accidents thus a higher risk than older drivers.

cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	Do not, I repeat, Do not flush that tranny or you will be replacing it within weeks, tell them to just drop the fluid pan and put in a new filter, when you flush a tranny all the debris is on the bottom of the pan and in the filter and they back flush all that dirt back through the tranny and it messes it all up.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	Then you don't take very good care of your car, do you?  Look in the maintenance section of your owners manual.  I'm guessing Dodge recommend it every 30,000 miles.  I suppose you don't change your oil regularly either.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	no, no, no ! i don,t believe in transmission flushings. i saw too many start leaking after they got it done and also not shift right. just drop the pan and change the fluid and filter.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Is it a manual or an automatic transmission?  If it's a manual then check the owner's manual - some manual transmission cars recommend actually not changing trans fluid.  Manual transmission fluid lives a pretty "stress free" life when compared to fluid in an automatic transmission<br>  <br>  If it's an automatic then it's probably not a bad idea to change the fluid.  Be clear that draining and refilling the fluid is often different from "flushing" the transmission.  A "flush" usually involves pressurized fluid running through it and can sometimes cause more problems than in solves (but sometimes is just fine to do).  Too much pressure and seals may start to leak or gunk may get freed up inside the trans and cause clogs etc. that wouldn't have happened had you just had it drained and re-filled without the pressurized flushing.<br>  <br>  I'd at least contact a Dodge service department and ask them whether they recommend an actual "flush" or if they just recommend a drain and change of the fluid before going through with a pressurized flush.|`|w5BjzqH1aa	No they are not trying to get money out of you. All car should have the transmission flushed out.  And you car is 30,000 passed when it is post to be done. A flush is a cleaning of the inside of the transmission. A filter change. A check of the transmission oil pan for metal. A new gasket. This service can keep you from be on the side of the road. The filter can only hold so much dirty until it stop up. Lack of transmission oil to some part of the transmission will cause the transmission clutches to wear out. It is cheaper keep up the maintains up, than rebuilding the transmission. They can tell you if the transmission need more serviced. A good working transmission will save you gas as well,.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Do it, but first, innocently ask what kind of fluid they're going to use.  If they aren't going to use Chrysler spec fluid, just promise to come back later and get the heck away from them!|`|bYnNbF1Oaa	don't do it....the trans fluid should be changed but you have waited to long and now you risk internal transmission issues by changing it now, if your trans is operating fine leave it alone if there's an issue with the trans...make sure you add friction modifier when the change is done|`|wBQYBvuZaa	Firebird makes a good point.<br>  <br>  Frankly with that many miles, it may do more harm than good. Over time, sludge and stuff builds up in the transmission. If you go flushing it all out at once, that could cause problems.<br>  <br>  Unless your fluid is black looking and smells burned, I would not do it.<br>  <br>  DO NOT add "friction modifier". Geez...  let this serve as a lesson. Never, ever listen to a mechanic.|`|97610695af40a850d0692690c92729e8aa	Your transmission is way past due for service.<br>  <br>   When the mechanic changes the oil he also replaces the filter.<br>  <br>  Go to several  reputable shops and get quotes ASAP.|`|NbCBk3mqaa	if you havent had any problems with the trans i would only do a standard filter change when its due.sometimes the trans flush can cause more problems with higher mile transmissions.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Unless the trans fluid smells burnt just a fluid and filter change.  If it does smell burnt change trans and add new oil to it......|`|9z5MZDlgaa	no that is not a scam. you really do need to get a transmission flushed about every 60,000 miles.
2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	The clutches have nothing do to with the gas pedal.   <br>  <br>  The reason that your car can stop with the engine running is that there  is a hydraulic coupling between the engine and the transmission.  It's called a "torque converter" because that is a special type of fluid coupling that is actually there.  <br>  <br>  If you want to imagine how a fluid coupling works, imagine two window fans facing each other and really close together.  If you turn one of the fans on.  The other fan will spin because of the air coming off the first fan.  But if you wanted to stop the 2nd fan, you could still stop it.<br>  <br>  That is, in a nutshell, a fluid coupling.<br>  <br>  Explaining the additional quirks of a torque converter is a lot harder, so I won't try to do that...|`|GNmzjDHHaa	The torgue converter is hooked to the back of the engine  as the rpms of the engine go up the t/c begins to lock up which turns the pump at the front of the trans and causes increased pressure at ur valve body.the valve body and oil pressure decide which clutches and bands to apply to make veh. go forward or reverse. There's more to it but basically that's it|`|AA12224567	The increased spin of the crankshaft Generates hydraulic pressure within the Torque converter. This pressure eventually causes the second half of the unit to spin up to the same pace as the pressure retards it's ability to slip along the races on the seconds shaft.<br>  <br>  See Torque converters.<br>  <a href="http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/towing/towing-capacity/information/torque-converter.htm" rel="nofollow">http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts...</a>

rFvZ3MQWaa	I would have to say either Swift or Schneider but really they are all pretty much the same. You will sign a contract with the company saying you will stay with them for a year or two. Your pay will be low in the beginning because they aren't really paying for it. You are paying for it by working for practically nothing. If you break the contract you will be required to pay it back in full. They also wont verify your schooling until it's paid. At least that's what happened to me :)<br>  I say Schneider or Swift because I have known people who went thru both of their programs and didn't have any problems.

SuZbBnycaa	Make sure the title has no lien holder on it. Even if the seller says it's been paid off. <br>  If he lost the title, then do the paper work at the DMV or AAA Auto Club with the seller. Both of you there together. That way, everything gets signed and completed. And then pay him in cash or money order after transfer is complete. <br>  In Calif you must produce a smog certificate that is no older than 90 days.

2380aff542a19c6efd4e19c2eb232951aa	A semi-truck is actually a tractor built into a truck chassis. So it is part "truck" and part "tractor" Tractors were built to run all day and pull very heavy loads. The average load nowadays is about 65,000 pounds and the average gross amount carried is about 80,000 pounds. Pulling 65,000 pounds up to 11 hours per day and up to 70 hours per week puts a lot of strain on a vehicle. A gasoline powered "truck" would just wear out.

If you caused the fender bender by committingg a "moving violation" e.g speed (over limit or too fast for condition), failed to yield right-of-way, etc., you will probably loose it for a while or even until age 18.  If you are at fault and the insurer of the vehicle takes issue, the vehicle owner will be on the hook for the damage.  You and your parents and the vehicle's owner can be respondents in a civil suit.

American workers are spoiled and go to work hungover, bitchhing about their wives, complaining about only getting paid $20 bucks an hour and don't focus on the job, resulting is sloppy work.

FWadS6i5aa	I agree with the other answer, with that many miles the bearings in the engine are worn out, the lobes on the cam are worn the lifters also. The suspension is near the end of its life, I would say its just worn out. the problems will surface very quickly and cost alot|`|U9bQgfY9aa	There is no way that a $950 vehicle, no matter who made it, is going to be reliable.    That is a vehicle for a teen age boy or someone who can do their own repair work. Because otherwise, you will be stranded by the road sooner than later.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	No way. You need something dependable, that will cost little to maintain. This thing is going to nickle and dime you into the poorhouse.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Unless it has had the engine rebuilt in that 210,000 miles I would not consider it a dependable vehicle.  That is really high mileage for an SUV engine.  SUV engines take a lot more wear and tear than a car engine over the lifetime of the vehicle.    Also, word to the wise.  Never take the word of anyone trying to sell their vehicle private sale when they tell you nothing is wrong with it.  Buyer beware.  Always have a certified mechanic look at the vehicle before buying a used vehicle.|`|AT0e3xwAaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Kids, Reliability, Ford Explo"d"er, 200 k?

A Toyota maybe.  One with over 150K is already pushing it.  Also, I think 1994 was one of the model years inlcuded in the rollover lawsuit.  The tire company took the brunt of the blame, but get real.  The consequence of a blown tire shouldn't be death.  On most cars, you can pull over and change the tire.  In the Explorer, a blown tire means you flip over and get killed.|`|oNv9UtKvaa	No I would not buy it...But my friend has a Toyota SUV with 305000 kilometers that has run fine all this time. The thing is you just don't know. My brothers car stooped at 222 000 kilometers. You know once they pass the 200 000, vehicles usually head down a steady road of maintenance. Even if this SUV ran another 20 000 kilometers you may find it a cash pit. It is 15 years old and with that many kilometers it is really not too good a deal--for the amount of driving you'll probably get out of it. I'd try to think more long-term, get a reliable vehicle that can be trusted and won't be an eventual cash-drain.  I don't know but here's what I think if you can afford it - (not sure if it actually works like this)    Let's say you get 40000 more kilometers out of it, so till 250 000 km.  For every dollar you spent you get $42 dollars on every km  (40000 / 950)  If you bought say a Toyota Corolla for $10 000 with 80 000km and got 250 000 km out of it, you spent $17 on every km  (170 000 (I got this from 250 000 - 80 000) / 10000)    Anyway this is what I think, I'm entirely sure of my math. Hopes this gives you a better idea.

The total load of the subs wired in parallel will be 1.3333 ohms. I would recommend the Kenwood KAC-9104D amp. It will be regulated to 900 W RMS@ 1-2 ohms so there will be plenty of power to drive the subs but not enough to blow them.

AA10331789	You can actually measure the rotor "run-out" to see how much the rotor wobbles as it rotates. Did you always use a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts? Uneven lug torque can cause warping of the rotors. Once you determine that the run-out is out of specification, you could have the rotors turned down (machined) while mounted on the car. That will take out any rotor run-out problem. If the problem persists, you might have the front end checked for excessive play in the components.    http://www.aa1car.com/library/bfixes.htm|`|qxSlQoRAaa	Are you sure your wheels are in balance?|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be that you got cheap rotors or a caliper is hanging up. it,s also could be grease on the rotors.

Both of these run forever with minimal service.  Just keep the oil changed and 9 out of 10 will give you over 200,000 miles.

If you are looking for a reasonable priced car that is very good on gas and nearly as dependable, look into a Chevy Cavalier.  I have seen tons of these go for a VERY long time.

Do you need 4 wheel drive, a wagon or just something simple? <br>  <br>  Most auto authorities reccomend the Mazda3, Toyota Corolla, and Honda Fit as the best new entry-level cars around. Kia and Hyundia are up and coming too. A certified used car is a great way to go - if you can afford it.<br>  <br>  On the 'cheap' side, Volvo 240s, Honda Accords, and Toyota Camrys are often well cared for, relaiable, and inexpesive to repair. The older the car, the more homework and closer inspection you'll need.<br>  <br>  Avoid high end, German cars and Saabs. Repair costs can add up quickly and not all repair shops will work on them. <br>  <br>  Stick to something frugal, and keep in mind the cost to insure, fuel, and repair. <br>  <br>  Lastly, cars depreciate very quickly. If you plan to drive this car into the ground, ok.

It started riding kinda shaky, when I pulled off the highway (80 miles from my destination) the wheel was hanging on by one bent lug, rubbing up against the frame of the truck.

GKBXkdDcaa	Could be a number of things. <br>  First thing to do is figure out whether it’s being caused by the driveline or by the suspension. Since you already suspect the motor mounts (yes it could be them), drive the car up to 70mph and put it in neutral. Does the vibration go away? If it does, then the problem is likely related to the driveline. It could be CV joints, motor mounts, etc. If the vibration doesn’t go away, it is likely in the suspension.

The dealership tends to charge more than mom and pop repair shops, but they've seen all sorts of situations (auto insurance problems, repair warranty issues, etc) and they seem to always find a way to help me.

H3qYfp6Paa	1) Check what kind of oil you have. When you are in a really cold area you need a certain kind of oil so the oil doesn't turn to Ice. When your oil becomes Ice you need to let it melt and change it, If you don't your truck will overheat.<br>  <br>  2) If nothing turns on in your truck (lights, door sound), Check your main fuses they are located somewhere around you battery, make sure the connections are connected correctly and that the wires are not touching anything but the battery posts.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you already ran you engine, while it overheated this could be the other problems.<br>  <br>  1) Water pump is not working.Overheated water causes you water pump to leak, or not circulate water. try changing the thermostat, most cases the thermostat gets stuck.<br>  <br>  2) Overheating engines could blow out (Specially Ford engines).|`|NbCBk3mqaa	start by checking the wires that go to the battery it could be a corrosion problem there,or the they could be loose.|`|pqqKLCmwaa	Be sure the new battery is installed properly,and all connections are tight. Check the battery with a voltmeter. If it is less than about 12.5 volts ,and it doesn't crank,then something is draining the battery. If you dont have a voltmeter, turn the lights on briefly and see if they light to full brightness. Then turn them off. Try to crank the truck, if the motor turns (does it make the usual cranking noise?) ,and doesn't start,you have a problem ,but not the battery. A lot of things can make it not start. If it doesn't even crank, but the battery has power in it as measured by the meter, or the light test, the starter ,or starter solenoid could be bad.<br>    CHECK the DRIVE BELT OR THE FAN BELT.. This could cause all the problems including the overheating.DO THIS FIRST.|`|eefdd2d971d42ad1ee9556089354b3dfaa	the first thing you should do is clean the battery cables where they go over the post. no one trouble spot.  buy a post cleaner from autozone or other.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	Its a ford....im surprised its lasted this long....

Toyota seem to get the balance best in this regard.
Fr6GdIQ3aa	The only way you will get money out of a creative idea is if you patent it.

e2tHoKNQaa	Alright. I own 2 yfz450's because I race. If you want some snappy power  then I say get the YFZ. The benefits of the 450R is it is a very powerful engine out of the box, it is fuel injected, it is wide so it is much more stable in corners, it is VERY well built and arguably the BEST 450 out on the market now. These engines are high revving and have power throughout the power band. The 450R is built for the track so they have to be maintained, the valves need to be checked ever 20 hours of riding or so. FYI I own the 450's not the 450r's but I have ridden several 450R's...one stock, one modded slightly, and one race ready.<br>  <br>  A Raptor is more of a trail quad. They are low revving and have more grunt force obviously. The reverse is a plus. The downside is they sit higher compared to a yfz and are very narrow so they are not NEARLY as stable as the yfz.<br>  <br>  Another thing to take into consideration...how comfortable you are on them. My advice is take a seat on both of them and if possible, ride both. See how you feel on them.<br>  <br>  I have a completely MX'ed out quad but I still will rip up the trails with my buddies on their trail quads. I even go through the "Quads not Advised" trails. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped you...if you have any further questions feel free to email me. I am pretty knowledgeable when it comes to quads. Have a good one.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Check again smart guy....the yfz450R is wider than a raptor700...check the site...compare the two in person, a yfz450R is 2 inches wider stock...which makes a HUGE difference in cornering. Don't ask questions and then be a dick to the people who offer knowledge and help. I know my stuff...I work at a quad shop and have been racing for a year...I am my own mechanic, NO ONE touches my quad but me or my dad. I didn't recommend a friggin yfz450 to you...I said I own one. I said I recommend the yfz450R....big difference. And by the way...carbs are really easy to jet, mine has never leaked and I have had it for 2 years, I have never had to clean it once...the only time you have to clean a carb is when you let the quad sit for a few months...and if you do that wth EFI good luck...it is even worse.<br>  <br>  Also...the ergonomics of the raptor and yfz450R are COMPLETELY different. Ride both of them and tell me the raptor is as easy to corner with...or even a stock 450 and the raptor. TOTALLY different. Something else to consider, the 450R's shocks are long travel...they handle amazingly better than the raptor's.<br>  <br>  If you want reverse and low revving, torqued out quad then get a raptor. That simple. If you want snappy power that revs high and is an amazingly designed quad...get a 450R.|`|kyYztNoUaa	The trx700 is a BLAST it a great trails bike and it's also a pretty good jumper|`|HfeSTtcPaa	yfz there faster and if you get stuck push it out thats what we do
AA10297143	I have the most recent edition of Kelly Blue Book and agree that the price of $10,500 is a good price but without seeing the car and determining how it has been maintained, cannot say it is a great price.  The mileage is quite low for a 2006, so maybe it needs to be aired out on the open highway, as it may have lots of city miles on it, which is not so good.  Be sure to have your normal mechanic run a diagnostic on it and check all the safety features before agreeing to buy.|`|eRX96A73aa	Kelly Blue Book says that this car should cost around $12,500.

AA12094894	Most garages won't fit parts that they haven't supplied because there is no way to offer a guarantee. The alternative is to have the garage supply and fit. They will probably charge around 30% mark up on the purchase price but fit for free. So your ￡23 back box would probably cost you around ￡30 to ￡35. Assuming they get it for the same price. You should have a go yourself, the back box is only supported by a couple of rubber mounts and a couple of bolts. Won't take you long and you will get the satisfaction of doing it yourself. good luck|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Most places will charge at least 30mins labour with some mega rip off places charging an hour (￡30-50).<br>  <br>  If you find a decent garage that are willing to charge for 10mins you've found a 1%er.

L0H4iVHWaa	heres some more info *copied from sparky*:<br>  <br>  Here is a guide that will help you set the gain correctly <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/uchv4dbk88</a><br>  <br>  You'll need a multi-meter (AC voltmeter, $15 from Radio$hack), Microsoft Excel and a way to burn an audio CD from an MP3.<br>  <br>  If you don't have Excel, use this link <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g" rel="nofollow">http://www.box.net/shared/nkkw1dhk4g</a><br>  <br>  Set the LPF to just below the highest range of the frequency response of the subs. Meaning if the frequency response of the sub is 20-200Hz, set the LPF to about 180Hz.<br>  <br>  Set the subsonics filter to about the same as the lowest setting in the range of the frequency repsonse of the subs. Meaning about 20Hz if that's the lowest in the range (20 -200Hz as above, if applicable).<br>  <br>  Don't set the Bass Boost above +2dB|`|RXFnFjhUaa	yeah listen to sparky. otherwise he'll send you a nasty email like he did to me when i didn't agree with him one time. Just cuz he hasn't kept up with technology since he started in the 80's he thinks i'm scared of him. to answer your question, you can just turn the gain down on your amp and set the bass to 0 and subsonic to around 20hz, then turn the volume up on any cd with lots of bass, then slowly turn up your gain until it distorts a little, then back of the gain one notch. Now you can adjust the bass to wherever you like. believe me, that's the easy way and it's going to sound great. 4 simple steps instead of sparky's 1984 system when subs couldn't handle any bass setting above +2

And just by chance you may find one that is fairly new.<br>  <br>  If it is not almost new, you will have to consider rebuilding before putting the engine in the truck.<br>  <br>  Nearly new truck (or car) engines can run close to $3000 with tranny.

TdrgZwnoaa	The right hand drive mail trucks that our post office uses are built on Chevy S-10 Pickup chassis by Grumman. The engine is the old Chevy 'Iron Duke' 4 cylinder and these trucks are designed to go 20 years before requiring an overhaul. Grumman Olsen stopped manufacturing in 1994-1995.<br>  <br>   Quite amazing when you consider the crap that Chevy expects the regular consumer to drive.
AA10724010	As poster 1 said, both Honda and Toyota already produce full luxury lines, Lexus being deeper.  However, Toyota/Lexus nor Honda/Acura makes a true sports car (SC430 and S2000 are/will be discontinued shortly).  Nissan/Infiniti comes much closer with the excellent 370Z, GT-R and G37 sport coupes.  Honda does make Accord/Civic coupes, but they are built off the same platform and body as the 4-door sedans, the Genesis coupe is not a 2-door version of the 4-door Genesis sedan.|`|DfK4JSytaa	Regardless, Hyundai is worth considering if yu want to buy a car that helps keep American jobs.

PAceoX2oaa	Depends on what you want to do. <br>  <br>  So, you're a 16 year old driver, and you've probably seen The Fast and The Furious a few too many times, but you know you want a car just like that. You wanna look cool in the parking lot at school, pick up the chicks, maybe rev on some Civic's at the red lights and such If this is the case, I highly recommend getting a non-turbo 2g DSM. The aftermarket is just as strong for them, seeing as it uses the 420a Chrysler motor, the same one as in the Dodge Neon. You can put body-kits on them, add turbo kits, intakes, exhausts, etc. They're dirt cheap, the insurance will be low, and they are fairly reliable cars.<br>  <br>  So... you're a 16 year old driver who visits the track regularly, wants to get into auto-cross or drag racing, has a clean record, could care less what your car looks like, doesn't street race, etc. If you're this mature, go ahead and get a turbo 1g or 2g Eclipse. This uses the Mitsubishi 4g63 and is a motor capable of well over 1000hp from its 2.0 liters. Almost any of the turbo cars are capable of performing well on the racetrack as well as being a fast daily driver. They aren't quite as reliable, however, and the more you modify them, the worse they tend to get. :) <br>  <br>  I hope you don't think I'm stereotyping you here. When I first got my car, I had a lot of wild ideas about what they were, what I wanted to do with it. Now after having owned my car for over 9 years and putting well over twelve thousand dollars into it, mostly the engine, I understand a little better about what these cars should be used for. If you're just planning on playing around with how it looks and sounds, you don't need the best of the best model for that. Leave the turbo AWD to the guys who are going to USE those traits for what they were built for.|`|it5JgZskaa	eclipses are quite possibly the easiest cars to work on with the most aftermarket support id definatley buy it especially if you like speed because yet again the superior aftermarket support combined with money and a little time and you have a real fast car there|`|LTlx22njaa	Yea its a good car...

The Hemi Durango has a LOT more hp (at least 340hp and more in the newest models) which is one of a few reasons why Dodge went with the 5.7L hemi on newer Durangos. <br>  <br>  Sorry but the Hemi Durango should smoke your 5.9 Durango.  <br>  <br>  Older Tahoes, Navigators and other large SUVs have power ranging from as low as 200hp (in mid 90's Tahoes with the 5.7L) all the way up to 300+ (in newer Navigators).  Most newer Escalades have even more than 300hp.<br>  <br>  If you're looking to get acceleration in your Durango comparable with the new ones, your best bet is to plunk down about $5000-$6000 and get a supercharger for your 5.9L.  Nothing else you could do cheaper (like an exhaust/intake etc.) is going to get you close to what you're looking for acceleration-wise.|`|N7LlOAcOaa	who cares its a DODGE and Dodges rule! Most powerful cars and trucks off the lot you can buy.|`|Ntqvxzioaa	Most people who drive what was a 40k plus truck really doesnt care if they are fast .... If you want fast and you have a good pocket go get a 09 vette for a 110k ... If you want the same speed and you live large get something italian .... If you are like a normal person get an rx7 bi turbo ... even if a durango had 1000 hp that means nothing cause the brick ways to much and can flip on a dime ...And the reason you are so fast off the line is cause they are not racing you ... try to buy something on your own and stop beating the crap out of mommy and daddys toys ... Oh and just to let you know one other dumb fact a durango is typically 4x4 meaning you really cant get stuck unless you dont know how to drive find a mud pit and have fun ....|`|u3HrKSGqaa	The 5.9 is the Magnum 5.9, an evolution of the older Chrysler LA engines used for muscle cars.

Y48qhj0Taa	The amp isn't going to blow that sub package. It is quiet a unequal match up. If you buy a larger I won't go more then 500 watts at 4 ohms for two channels. I haven't heard to may good stories about Sony's line of subs. If you got a good deal then rock on. <br>  <br>  If the subs can handle (distortion wise), start slowly moving the gain up and see where it takes you. Stop if the amp gets to hot, the subs come flying out, or anything else bad.<br>  <br>  I know that's not too technical, but it sounds like you are just looking for an okay for this package.|`|gstBWswfaa	Your subca can take up to 600 watts RMS and it looks like your about half powering them so a new amp would help.. but dont expect much from them they are cheap sony subs with a cheap cone that really wont produce a quality sound or push much air|`|8mtmGTFLaa	well your subs are about 380rms a sub so together they are around 760watts rms so here is a cheap way to give them more power<a href="http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=17604" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...</a> <a href="http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=14573http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=16889http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=18046" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...</a> or jus get another amp like this one <a href="http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/ProductDetail.aspx?ProductID=17925" rel="nofollow">http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...</a>|`|Kh6dMQFfaa	A new amplifier would be your cheapest option.

JwUHCwcJaa	Wow! Switching from half ton Silverado to a tiny compact coupe is a drastic change. You might miss the larger space found in your truck. The 4 cylinders aren't that bad in my experience. I have owned my Eclipse for almost 19 years now and the only major work done on my car was a head gasket oil leak, which the 420A engine is notorious for. The newer model Eclipse have a Mitsubishi built engine and are a little better than the Chrysler built 420A engine. When you get one, just keep up with the scheduled maintenance like I am and you'll find out that these little coupes can last longer than your neighbors' caddy.|`|it5JgZskaa	id buy it ive always liked the eclipse i have never had any problems with any of them also id like to know who said the upkeep for newer cars are tedious thats stupid if anything the 94 is more tedious because its getting older and more stuff goes wrong faster

Trace the accelerator cable to the engine and you will find it connected to an electronic switch that tells the computer the position on the throttle. <br>  <br>  They wear out and/or get dirty, very common on a car this age. If you have a manual and an ohm meter you can check the resistance to see if it is up to spec.

zSZdgWKZaa	Your local audio shops can install them!  We used  to install them were i worked! but they are easy to install you should try it to do it your self first! they are easy, unplug the bulb and plug it to the ballast plug that will fit to. and then just plug the HID bulb to the connectors form the ballast. An advise! you should try to buy aftermarket headlamps because they are usually projectors and your hid will put out better light and minimize the glare to almost none. (assuming that you have reflector type headlamps) It would be better to retrofit to a real hid headlamp because then you'll get the full benefit of hid lighting but that is expensive and time consuming.|`|IETH9UEVaa	seriously hids are the easiest thigns to install to your car cuz its all plug and play kind of thing but if you really really dont want to do it urself. don't go to body shops cuz they will never do it. go find a tuning company around ur area. i don't know where you live so you gotta find that yourself.|`|u3HrKSGqaa	Never get the kind that is just an HID bulb/ballast that you put in place of your Halogens -- it's illegal because the projector housing isn't designed for the light pattern of HID's, causing too much glare to everybody else on the road.  If you have HID bulbs, you need an HID housing.

AA11148143	There were several attempts at this, most notably Molt Taylor's Aerocar. On the ground it disconnects the prop and engages a regular transmission that drives the wheels.<br>  <br>  Generally, it's neither a good airplance nor a great car, and failed to become popular. One reason is that engine hours spend running on the ground count against the time between overhauls, or TBO. That makes them rather expensive. It's also rather heavy, which means a small payload, or short range, or slow cruise speed.<br>  <br>  A better solution might be a towable plane with folding wings that you store in your garage; hangar rents are high.

I bet there's no much difference.|`|AA11264416	well my opinion is that driving an uninsured vehicle is illegal to drive on the road no matter what and in some states you can't even park an uninsured vehicle on the street, so really your 100% at fault since the car you drove was uninsured, but my opinion about what happened, both of you were at fault 50/50 because he was speeding but also you didn't switch lanes safely without properly checking for clearance so its almost like you pulled out in front of him, i think its just 50/50 nobody is more at fault than the other, it would be like someone pulling out in front of someone, the one that pulled out will be considered at fault no matter what, my uncle was driving a company van which he was insured to drive since he worked for the company and it was at night, he stopped at the stop sign and pulled out, well someone was coming down the other road hauling a** with no light on at all, so it was the other cars real fault but they said my uncle was the one at fault, sometimes laws don't make much sense and they should be more flexible but they're not, i don't know what the judge will say, it seems like his insurance will be able to pay for his damagess since it was a "no fault" claim but maybe if his insurancee does then his will go up so maybe he's just suing you so his insurance doesn't go up if he wins|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	fault is indicated on the police report but it's coded and you wouldn't notice it, even if the plaintiff doesn't come after you his insurance company will|`|AA11914369	Your fault, two reasons.  1.  You were changing lanes.  And the law is clear in all states that you can't change lanes unless the way is clear.  The fact you were hit shows the lane was not clear.  The law does not say "You can't change lanes unless the way is clear, unless someone is speeding, then it's okay to pull in front of them."  2.  Without insurance on the vehicle, you shouldn't have been driving.  Doesn't matter who owned the car, you were responsible to be sure there was insurance on it before you drove it.  So, pay the person for the damage you caused.  Pay now, or later, after you lose in court and the court fees are added.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	It doesn't matter how fast the other car was going. You changed lanes when it wasn't safe to do so and that places the fault at your feet. The fact you were driving without insurance means you get to pay for the damage to the other vehicle. While driving with no insurance is illegal, it does not automatically make you at fault. Negligence and improper lane change does that.|`|o5KbZk1saa	The bottom line here is that the accident is 100% your fault as the car was not even supposed to be on the road.<br>  Regardless of the state or who hit who you will be held 100% liable.<br>  If there was personal injury you could be paying for the rest of your life.<br>  i hope it all works out for you.|`|GNmzjDHHaa	Be glad ur only being sued for veh. damage and not personal injury.  No insurance you are automatically at fault because ur not suppose to be on the road. Personal injury can run into the  millions.  For what it costs I'd be talking to a lawyer
hkLY035raa	It's possible you burned up the fuel pump by running the tank dry, but how much gas did you add?  Was it enough to reprime the fuel pump?<br>  <br>  Replace the fuel filter, then try adding more fuel to get the prime back into the pump.  Hope for the best!|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Most likely, you burned up the fuel pump. It's in the tank, and the gas in there keeps it running cool. When you ran out, it pumped itself to death. Good luck.|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Dirt is probably clogged the filter. I suggest buying something more reliable.|`|AwMLh8Iiaa	Im not a mechanic, but i do have general knowledge of engine repair. Sounds to me like your fuel filter could be clogged. if you can get to it thats what i would check first.other than that maybe a relay or fuse for the fuel pump. but that problem would not be triggered by running out of gas. hope this helps
zlPAVkUBaa	Yes, as sad as it is to say. I love the metric system, everything is based on multiples of tens.<br>  <br>  Ours is based on 12, 1, 3, 5280, etc. Even a nautical mile is equal to 1852 meters. Convert it to an English measure and you've got the decimal point involved.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	As far as I know they all use feet, that avoids confusion, and all air traffic controllers use english, same deal. Keeps the plane at 30 000 feet from running into the plane at 9 100 meters.|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Feet is usually used.  Meters is sometimes used.<br>  <br>  Altitude can be a barometric altitude or a true altitude.  <br>  <br>  Horizontal distances are given in meters, kilometers, nautical miles, or statute miles.<br>  <br>  Horizontal visibility is given in statute miles, kilometers, feet, or meters. <br>  <br>  Runway visual range is given in meters or hundreds of feet.<br>  <br>  Flight levels are measured above the standard datum plane, not above mean sea level.<br>  <br>  Windspeed in the US is given in knots.

When they read it back there was a slight hesitation over "2,000 . . . er . . . feet . . ." and the helpful controller came back with "Okay, let's call it 600 metres this time!"<br>  <br>  "Ah, 600 metres, roger!"<br>  <br>  Russian aircraft have their instruments in metric . . .|`|xBoFYW5Naa	Yup, as already stated most announcements by the pilot are in feet<br>  <br>  "Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your Captain speaking, we have reached our cruising alt of 34,000ft"|`|sHHcfA6haa	Yes.|`|23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	There are some interesting answers but none of them are right.<br>  <br>  Because it is very important that no confusion whatsoever should occur in communications between aircraft and air traffic control some specific conventions are used. This is a brief and not detailed summary.<br>  <br>  Elevation<br>  The height of an airfield or tall object above mean sea level.<br>  <br>  Height<br>  The height of an aeroplane above local ground level (very rarely used).<br>  <br>  Altitude:<br>  The "height" of the aircraft above mean sea level.<br>  <br>  Flight Level:<br>  This is the altitude above mean sea level as measured with an altimeter calibrated to be 0 at 1013 millibars. It is not the true altitude above sea level, because the pressure at sea level At The Location of the aircraft is probably not 1013mB. But all aircraft in the area will have the same "error" so they won't hit each other. <br>  <br>  Altitude, Flight Level, Aircraft Vertical Separation & Elevation are all vertical measurements and are quoted in FEET.<br>  <br>  Horizontal distance at ground level:<br>  Length of runway, visibility in fog, separation distance between aircraft and stand etc.<br>  Measured in METRES.<br>  <br>  <br>  Horizontal distance in the air:<br>  Aircraft separation as measured horizontally (ahead, behind, left or right) when they are at the same Flight Level.<br>  Measured in NAUTICAL MILES.<br>  <br>  Aircraft airspeed:<br>  This is the forward speed of the aeroplane when compared to that of the prevailing wind which it flying through. Airspeed is usually different from its Groundspeed (speed of aeroplane relative to the ground).<br>  Measured in KNOTS (nautical miles per hour).<br>  <br>  Windspeed:<br>  Speed of wind at the aeroplane's Flight Level.<br>  Normally quoted in METRES PER SECOND.<br>  <br>  Outside air temperature:<br>  Always measured in Celcius (centigrade) except where some Americans don't understand that so Farenheit is still quoted.<br>  <br>  The idea of using different units is so that when an Air Traffic Controller gives information to the pilot he will know exactly to what parameter the number refers. <br>  This is a sort of double-check in case the pilot mis-hears the first part of the message. On modern aircraft you just enter the numbers into the on board computer and the units are automatically taken care of when it gives you your navigation information (i.e fly "that way").<br>  <br>  This is the international standard. But as someone said, not all nationalaities like having to use English. There are local variations in some countries. This can cause confusion to the unwary so be careful if you fly a private plane over France. <br>  <br>  The on-board cabin displays in some aeroplanes usually simplify everything and convert the units into Imperial or Metric to suit the nature of the passengers. It's a pity that they assume all English speakers are Amercian.|`|dd3f04c40d73f1030d5e1e9239d4c81baa	No!<br>  <br>  There are several different sets of ICAO standards, and individual countries are free to adopt whichever set of standards they want.<br>  <br>  The vast majority use Imperial (feet)....but not all.<br>  <br>  If you fly Aeroflot for example, you get the height in meters...and this will be the case in any Airline whose National ICAO Standards use metric measurements for altitude.|`|KPwNgDWJaa	I've only heard it stated in feet.

tUtdxkDYaa	26 cents and a piece of bubble gum.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	I think $10/person is fine. How does it compare to 15% of the cost of the bus?|`|qveUwJ84aa	Well it's like this...<br>  <br>  If you want to use the service again tip.<br>  If your not going to use the service again don't tip.<br>  <br>  If you don't like those is ideas then think about how many people in the group can afford ten extra dollars.  You're all obviously going to be pitching in for the service.  Plus you'll be paying for whatever event you need or want the service for.<br>  <br>  No matter what you will be a conversational piece for the drivers personal life just like the experience on the bus will be a conversational piece for all of you who will be on the bus, so if you can live with him talking badly about your party because you didn't tip him then don't.  But if you can NOT live with knowing that he'll be talking badly about your party then tip him, Just keep in mind every persons budget and try not to get mad at the ones whom can't help as much as others.<br>  <br>  SG|`|JXWC0fxPaa	If the tip is not built into the total cost, the usual gratuity is 15-20 pct of the total fare. If the bus rents for 150.00/hr, base your tip on the total use time, including donated time. So 12 hrs at 150.00/hr comes to 1800.00 times 0.2 (20 pct) equals 360.00 divided by 40 souls equals $9 per person.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|AA12306754	I would tip at least 15% of my cost of renting the bus.
