20090220135201AAgZjUd	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why do my headphones always break?	Seriously...they break like every 3-4 months & then my mom gets pissed at me.   No one else's seems to break this much.   I swear I take really good care of them & my ipod because if I ever lost my ipod I would die.   I can't afford to buy like $30 and $100 headphones so I always buy either these $15 jelly 1's or these $15 sony one's.   I always buy myself new 1's because my mom like refuses to buy them for me & if she does they are from the dollar store because she says they shouldn't break so much & she won't pay $15 every time they break.   I probably listen to my ipod like 50% of the day though...do you think that makes them break faster?   The reason I'm asking this is because they just broke again & I've only had them for like 3 months & I know when I tell my mom about it even if I give her the money to buy new 1's she is gonna be so pissed off at me.
20090220135221AAo8FiQ	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	What is the current most popular cell phone in the world, including non-smart phones?	Somebody told me that the most popular cell phone in the world is the iphone and I choose not to believe this due to the fact that not everyone in the world buys a smartphone (if you want to call iphone one). I would say that the iphone is the most recognizable phone because of the hype but it can not be the most popular one?? Can it? I do not think that data from accessories sellers is viable because not everyone buys accessories. Iphone users seem to love accessories. Nor internet use data as concrete ranking since not everyone use the internet on the phone.

My question is,  can I use this cord or will it damage the tv or "blow up"- or whatever?   I have no idea about what Volts, Hz, or watts really mean or specify....

20090220145225AA5tVyf	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	What is a good digital camera for a teen girl?	Hi everyone... I will be a freshman in the fall of this year. I'm looking into either buying a digital camera or asking for one for my graduation (8th grade.. haha), or birthday (august).       I would like one that gets really good photo quality. If not really good, at least good ones.      My budget is under $200, preferably, around the $150 or under range.      I would be using this for still photography as well as action and some short videos.      Color doesn't matter, and neither does brand. I prefer a brand that is well-known for good cameras though.      I don't have a preferred size.      Thanks in advance!

I tried this with my speakers at the moment, but it seemed that sound only plays out the subwoofer and only one out of 2 of the speakers - but these speakers are old so I dont know if its just a problem with them, or if because its a headphone slot, that it is only playing out of 2 speakers?      I just feel this would be a cheaper option than buying a "home cinema system" as I am planing to get Logitech x-540 speakers which appear relatively cheap....      I am not very good at these type of things, so can you try and dumb answers down a bit lol       If i can't do this, what do i need to make it work???      Thanks, Lee x
