Lz5352sOaa	Hey. la informacion ke mande a tu pregunta anterior es buena.  at least mejor que la otra respuesta. asi ke eligela como mejor respuesta tan siquiera.. ya ni el tiempo que me pase buscando. En serio.    Ahora el que ellos no te hayan respondido no es una buena senal. Habla mucho de lo que profesionalismo significa en su politica academica y profesional. Why do you want to be affiliated with such an institution anyway.  y ni siquiera ponen esa informacion tan basica en su website. Every academic institution (at least the serious ones) publish the tuition and fees cost on their website.    I would definitely send the email again and ask them and strongly convey why you are so interested in their academic institution. If they don't  answer, shame on them and don't associate your self with such unprofessional organization.  I would recommend Tec de Monterrey, instead, or colegio or instituto chapultepec. A great School is Escuela Activa Integral. mmmm what else.  I guess that's it.     Y oye. choose me as Best answer over the other one that didn't even attempt to help.  Seriously..  the colegio del valle people didint answer but thats a bad service on their side. not on mine. dont you think ?     Well. good luck. I have a friend that went to Colegio del Valle. several friends actually. its a good school. If you live in the city the school is, maybe you could directly go there if not, and if you are extremely interesting maybe give them a phone call.
X4nyN92Eaa	I have a few suggestions:  1: I load a LOT of movies (baby einstein, teletubbies etc) onto my ipod. That was she can watch and hopefully fall asleep!    2: My food rules go out the window! I pack sweet treats that I normally would not let her have.    3: Buy a new toy (not a noise maker) that you do not show them until you get onto the plane. I normally bring 2-3 for a 10 hour flight.     4: I pack granola bars for me. Its almost impossible to eat if you have to hold them on your lap. Now if there is an empty seat you'll be in luck - but don't count on it.     5: I would ask the ticket agent when you arrive if the flight is full and try yo get a empty seat next to you. Most people I have found will volunteer to move away from you so you can have the seat. You might need to sit at the back of the plane - but its worth it.     Under no circumstances try to give you baby benadryl or any other OTC medication to fall asleep. There have been way too many deaths related to that. We have as much right to travel with a baby as others have to travel alone.  Have fun - your baby can sense the stress you feel and may make them more upset.     Best of luck!!!|`|6b85b396fd9d3c07ef85fcc95aa4a6a9aa	10 month old is no problem. I did that several times with my 2 children.    You will be allocated a front row seat where there is a wall and they have little cots where your child can sleep, so you will not have to have it on your lap all the time. I am sure it will sleep for some hours at least. You don't need many toys for such a small child, just bring a view, so you can occupy it.   Food... bring some along you are sure it does like it. You don't need to spoil it all the time, just do things as you normally would do.   Of course it is embarrassing if a child would cry all the time, but hey, it wont and everybody will help with any concern you might have. Don't worry, just look forward to some good time all together in Asia.     Just remember, anticipate more time and do everything slow, so the baby wont get stressed. As long as you are relaxed, the baby will be as well, as soon as you get stressed, the baby will be as well - they have a vibe for that!    Have a good flight, both of you!|`|D730myDqaa	Eat at the Airport    Everyone in the whole plane is going to hate you if your child is crying and noisy for 13 hours    my best tip to you is to heavily sedate your child and hope it sleeps the whole trip.|`|AA11523419	I've traveled with an infant on several occasions but for not  nearly that length of time. You will find  the flight attendants will be very helpful in assisting you with your baby. Hopefully the flight will not be full and you can be moved and have an extra seat or two for more room. And lastly, don't give another thought as to what other passengers might think. Have a safe an pleasant flight.

It all depends on how much drinking you plan on doing.  The drinks can range from $4-$7 depending on where you do.  There are a lot of things that you can do here and hanging out on the beach is always fun and free if your not gonna drive on the beach.  I would think about how much you spend on a weekend going out and triple that.|`|pXPZ47Xeaa	Besides the fact that alot of stuff was destroyed their from current hurricanes, it is very expensive.  When I went over 6 years ago a glass of beer could cost you roughly $4-5 and food isn't the cheapest.  There are alot of attractions and things to do, so you definately need to take a lot of money, depending if you want to do alot there, i would roughly say to expect between $400-$500 per person for the week.
AA12111688	Buying resale is definitely the way to go, but I've not ever heard of this particular company.  But, if I were you, I'd log onto the timeshare users forum and ask this question there.      http://www.tugbbs.com    There's a wealth of information there.  Lots of members who have loads of experience buying great timeshare properties for cheap.  There's bound to be someone there who is familiar with CNC.    Good Luck!

82bbcafd3a60a898034ecdb65c961947aa	En Galveston, los fines de semana los hoteles son mucho mas caros que entre semana, pero hay hoteles buenos en los que la noche sale en $170 - 190 (Holiday Inn), $130 - 180 (Best Western).  Estos hoteles estn sobre Seawall Boulevard, que esta justo frente a la playa y son creo yo los mas accesibles en trminos de costo.  Los otros hoteles sobre Seawall Blvd. salen mucho mas caros.    Los hoteles que no estn frente a la playa por lo general son mas baratos, pero no estn en tan buenas condiciones ni en reas muy seguras para los visitantes.  Adems, son los hoteles que se llenan primero.  Dudo que encuentres cuartos disponibles cerca del fin de semana.    Suerte,    Erika

5uEAHEQJaa	I always thought they were one and the same|`|2N2jhK4uaa	A jacuzzi uses a aerator or adds air to the water when requested. this gives the bubble effect. It is said to soothe the senses and relax. A whirlpool basically does the same thing but without the air. The water jets have an added advantage that it massages the muscles more deeply thus giving the body a deeper state of relaxation and calm. Unfortunately the hotels know this and therefore charge more for the rooms with this facility. Hope this reply helps you financial decision.|`|N2ZrzJ0raa	i didn't know there was a difference, i always thought they were one or the other!!|`|9ZLEWH2Raa	Jacuzzi is a brand name. Like Coke is to soda, so is Jacuzzi to a whirlpool. Basically, they take water from the tub area, and pump it through pipes to nozzles, or "jets".    An "air spa" does the same thing as a whirlpool, but with air instead of water.    That last one is usually more expensive to buy, maybe that is what they meant by a "more expensive whirlpool."|`|KImvstvfaa	the bubbles are air pumped into set of jets in  jacuzzi while the heated water are transferred into impellers to put out through the jet with pressure in whirlpool.  Some jacuzzi have heated air plume to warm the water and air before they go through the jets. I would prefer to have jacuzzi baths due to more vigorous cushioning effects than water jet massaging effect of whirlpool.
ove9NJ8Haa	Depending on whether you will be alone, or traveling with children, or someone else. At this time of year, I strongly advise taking bottles of water. You never know if something will happen to the car, and you may be stranded for any time at all. If possible, a fully charged cell phone. Take a car charger with you. If children, and no DVD player, take Cd's meant for them. Any meds you or passengers rely on. Take them in the original bottles. Phone numbers of anyone you may need to call, either for emergency or to let them know where you are! Snacks, fruits, crackers, whatever you and your passengers prefer. Word of warning! Nothing with caffeine if traveling with children, or red food coloring. Both will make them hyper.   Stop at least every 2 hours or so, walk around, stretch a bit. Rejuvinates the body and mind!|`|5AnA0MLTaa	Read, play a portable game system such as a gameboy, talk to whoevers in the car, look at the view, call ur friends, text, etc...

Imw7KkMraa	Yo viaj a San Jos del cabo. Llev solo pesos mexicanos y no tuve ningn problema.   El error fue elegir San Jos del Cabo y no "Cabo San Lucas " !!!    Amigo...San Jos del Cabo es aburridisimo...a no ser que te la pases en clases de buceo y en bicicleta....no hay nada ms que hacer.   Si lo que buscas es lugares para ir a divertirte en la noche, bailar, buenas cenas, ver turistas....lo mejor es Cabo San Lucas.|`|I3Tc4kDbaa	Hello Moto!!    Hola amiga, pues mira por un lado te conviene traer peso mexicano pues efectivamente el dolar aca mucha gente (por lo regular los de los autobuses y camiones y en las tienditas peque?as) te toman el dolar al precio que a ellos mejor les convenga, Pero por otro lado aunque pagues con peso mexicano te van a regresar feria en Dolares y visceversa!! Es tu decision aunque seria mas facil que pagaras con tarjeta! Y lo que dice Mel no es cierto , la belleza y lo espectacular de Los Cabos reside justamente en saber eligir a donde quieres ir, si quieres venir a andar de chile bolita viendo na mas a ver que haces, pos si San Lucas es la mejor opcion porque hay muchos antros y una vida nocturna muy "salvaje" como le llaman los springbreakers!! pero si lo que quieres es relajarte o pasar una velada romantica con tu pareja la mejor opcion es San Jose del Cabo. Solo debes ser inteligente e investigar y no eligir un lugar a lo loco!! Aun asi San Jose no esta muy lejos de San Lucas!!    Que weno que vengas de antemano bienvenida a lo mejor y hasta te hospedas en el hotel que trabajo!!! a ja ja!!    The Queen of The King Of Fighters has answered you!    DOUSHITA NO!    Saludines de la choyera menos choyera de todo Los Cabos BCS, Mx.    Me pushi veras!!    .|`|44525ab6958213961eeb023716b1d34daa	Yo fui del 09 al 13 de Junio... si te hospedas en San Jose, puedes tomar un camion que pasa frente a la Mega Comercial y te cobra 25 pesos por llevarte a Cabo San Lucas. si  estas hospedado en Cabo San Lucas ya estas en el centro de la diversion.    El primer dia toma una taxi-lancha en la marina principal junto al HARD ROCK que te lleve a ver el ARCO y te baje en la Playa del Amor, ahi no se puede nadar pero esta suave y puedes ver el Pacifico desde el otro lado de esa playa, cuando ya te aburras espera y los lancheros va y viene a la Playa del Amor, de ahi que te lleven a la Playa del MEDANO, ahi puedes comer y disfrutar de unas bebidas mientras nadas en esa Playa, si t egusta el SNORQUEL en el arco hay bastantes cosas que ver pero el agua esta HELADA !.    Cuando ya te aburras del MEDANO te regresas a tu HOTEL, te ba?as y te vas a bailar al MAMBO CAFE, salsa, cumbia y merengue sabroson, cobran $100 pesillos de entrada pero te regalan una copa, cada copa vale $50 pesillos, cuando ya te aburras (como a las 2:00 am), te vas a SQUID ROE y te dedicas a ver a las gringas como hacen su "despapaye", no te cobran COVER... con eso es bastante actividad paar el primer dia.    El Segundo dia toma el camion AZUL-VERDE y que te baje en el "Chileno", solo preocupate de llevar SOMBRILLA, TOALLA, AGUA-REFEFRESCO-CHUPE, HIELOS, SNORQUEL, VISOR, ALETAS y CHALECO y FRUTA COMO MANGOS, en esta playa hay un peque?o arrecife, los peces estan a 5 metros de la orilla esperando que los turistas les lleven comidita, metete con unos mangos cerca del arrecife y dentro del agua destripa un "mango", te veras rodeado de peces al instante, si eres bueno para el SNORQUEL acercate al arrecife y ahi hay mas variedad, es una playa "magnifica", de agua muy fresca, por no decir fria, aunque no tanto como la del "arco". te regresa del mismo modo (CAMIONCITO), en la noche puedes visitar los bares de CABO, hay un restaurant de Mariscos que los da a buen precio y el lugar esta ELEGANTE, se llama el POPEYES, pide unos TACOS EMPERADOR DE CAMARON o unos Camarones POPEYES, son una delicia, no pidas entrada, los sirven con ensalada, arroz y frijoles...     Para el tercer dia pudes decirle al del camion que te baje en la Playa Santa Maria, una playa ideal para broncearte y relajarte... no olvides llevar las mismas cosas que al "Chileno", yo me llevaba un refreso quehabia enfriado en el refrigerador de la habitacion del hotel toda la noche y le echaba TEQUILA, asi llevaba mi provision de CHUPE... ji ji.    Si aun te sobra energia y dinero, compra un TOUR a CABO PULMO (como 160 USD), dicen que es una preciosidad, o un TOUR a las DUNAS en cuatrimoto... ve al ESTUARIO de San Jose... en fin, hay mas cosa que hacer para no aburrirse en el hotel    PD. todos te aceptan pesos mexicanos y recoge tu basura de las Playas que visites.... aun estan en proceso de Certificacion....|`|B9W3zvI3aa	En teoria se utiliza el peso mexicano, pero como es una zona muy visitada por los extranjeros, el dolar es lo que mas se mueve, yo te recomiendo ke no lleves ni dolar ni peso mexicano en efectivo, usa mejor alguna tarjeta de credito, ya si no tienes pues cualkiera de los 2.|`|nxARG4glaa	lleva pesos mexicanos porque el dolar te lo van a tomar como les de su gana y ay se te va ir una feria yo se lo que te digo de ejemplo los lancheros que te llevan ala playa del amor que son los que te pasan por adentro del arco ., lugar que tienes que conocer !!!!! san jose del cabo esta muy serca de cabo san lucas|`|9a5PkxX7aa	puedes traer de los dos no inporta  solo que es un poco caro en lo turistico   un tip que te puedo psar es que regatees ( que le digas que se baje de precio)  te van a decir que no pero tu haste la indiferente y le dices que vas aver si lo encuentras mas barato y entonses cedera   jajaj es que yo vivo a qui   y asi es el comercio con los turistas.|`|2Cj4dg8uaa	Ps te recomiendo que te lleves Mita de Mexicano y Mita de Dolares y una tarjeta de credito por si las dudas.    *-*Saludos y Suerte*-*|`|845cf5bb429bb898a8ecff3aa5ea60cfaa	no mijo si te ven dolares te van a querer ver la cara de gringo.... y te van a cobrar mas... trae tus pesitos mexicanos y maneja el menos efectivo que puedas.... te vas a funcionar mejor con tarjeta.
cce8b084c5dcabf1c7584938f8143e84aa	Hola; como ya sabes, hay muchsimos lugares que pueden visitarse desde el DF y que estn a slo unas pocas horas de distancia. Depende de qu tanto tiempo ests dispuesto a hacer de camino, pero incluso la capital de Oaxaca (que ya est algo lejos) est a slo seis horas en autobs. Pero la distancia muy bien vale la pena. Si eres estudiante, con tu credencial obtienes un 50% en los boletos de autobs durante toda la temporada de vacaciones, en verano, invierno y semana santa, y as sale muchsimo ms barato.    Hay muchos destinos interesantes. Creo que la mejor recomendacin, si vas a viajar solo, es que vayas a un lugar donde haya un hostal para jvenes; adems de ser la opcin ms barata cuando viajas solo, estar en un hostal es en s una experiencia muy interesante, porque adems de conocer el lugar a donde vayas podrs conocer a otros viajeros nacionales e internacionales que tambin estarn interesados en conocer el lugar y a otras personas. En cada hostal, adems, muy probablemente te podrn proporcionar informacin sobre todas las cosas interesantes que haya que hacer en esa localidad. Si todava no conoces lo que es un hostal, puedes visitar esta pgina:   http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostal    Hay muchas pginas con listas de hostales en Mxico; creo que lo ideal es escoger primero la ciudad que quieras visitar y despus buscar en internet un hostal ah que te agrade. Procura tambin encontrar la pgina oficial de cada hostal que te interese, generalmente ah tendrn fotos, mapas, precios y ms informacin til.    http://hostales.lugaresdemexico.com/  http://www.hostels.com/en/mx.ot.html  http://www.hostelmania.com/HostelCountry...  http://www.hostelworld.com/countries/mex...  http://www.thebackpacker.net/travelhoste...  stas son slo algunas pginas con listas de hostales en Mxico. A veces, especialmente en vacaciones, conviene hacer reservaciones por telfono o e-mail antes de salir.    Acerca de los destinos, aunque hay literalmente cientos de lugares a donde ir a pocas horas desde el DF, algunos de mis favoritos son, con sus tiempos aproximados de viaje en camin desde el DF:  - Puebla y Cholula (2 horas)  - Cuernavaca (1 hora)  - Taxco (3 horas)  - Quertaro (3 horas)  - Morelia (4 horas)  - Guanajuato y San Miguel de Allende (6 horas)  - Veracruz y Jalapa (4 horas)  - Oaxaca (6 horas)  En todos estos lugares, y en muchos ms, encontrars hostales para viajeros de todo el mundo.    ltima recomendacin: antes de salir a cualquier viaje, vale la pena investigar un poco en internet sobre ese lugar, los paseos, las atracciones, la comida, la historia, la msica, etc. Un excelente recurso para empezar es Wikipedia (http://es.wikipedia.org/).     Espero que esto te ayude. Suerte!|`|e8189740eaef22f12fca641cc19c64c4aa	Cuernavaca, Puebla.|`|kq9QzP2Iaa	Cuernava, Cuautla.  Quertaro. Toluca.

You will need lots of warm weather clothes for the summer and a decent jacket for the winter (which does not last long).      I assume by natural disasters you are worried about earthquakes.  Well, yes they happen but Davis is not really on a fault and it is very rare.  My opinion is don't worry about things that are out of your control.    Davis is a wonderful college community and on my 10 ten for CA cities.  You are within hours of the beach, snow, lakes and 2 metro cities.  I love Davis.  Have fun!
APUhd0cOaa	1- Desde el df en las terminales norte o sur  hay lineas que salen a Acapulco... puedes entrar a la pag de estrella de oro o estrella blanca para que te enteres bien de los detalles  2-Supongo que si por avion  3-Checa las paginas de avolar.com o despegar.com, en ellas encuentras costos e itinerarios de varias aerolineas... aunque creo que aeromexico es buena opcion  4- La diferencia es que tanto estrella de oro como estrella de blanca (suc. papagayo)... estan en la Av. Cuahutemoc que corre paralela a la Av. Costera y la Estrella de oro Diamante esta en Bvd. de las Naciones rumbo al princes y al aeropuerto....... como ya te dicen escoje la terminal de acuerdo a donde te vayas a hospedar  5- Es algo largo el trayecto pero el lindo Taxco vale la pena (en lo personal reservaria un viaje especial para visitarlo sin prisas)  6-Creo que no... te vas Aca-DF a la terminal del norte..que si ya estas algo cansado te duermes y ni cuenta te das de las 4 horitas... ya estando ahi estiras las piernas compras algo y tomas el sig a Veracruz... supongo que asi no se siente tan largo el viaje      Suerte y disfruta el tremendo sol y calor de esta ciudad :)|`|755923d7441b182fd30c40ab2d5c241faa	1.- Puedes tomar un autobus de la Estrella de Oro..

Cuauhtemoc, muy cerca de la Costera, q es la zona hotelera, osea muy centrico..  2.-Claro q se puede salir desde Puebla.. Solo que en la ocasin que lo hice fue por medio de la Estrella blanca..  3.- En cunto a aerolineas te recomiendo q si lo vas a hacer, reserves con tiempo, x q cundo lo haces ya casi llegando a la fecha te sale carito..  4.- La terminal Diamante esta lejisimos; esta en el Boulevard de las Naciones, cerca del hotel Princess, y si llegas ah vas a tener q tomar un taxi para venir a la zona centrica de Acapulco, a menos q alguien t vaya a recojer.. No te lo recomiendo, a menos q tu hotel o donde vayas a llegar este por esa zona..  5.- Para ir a Taxco, igualmente te recomiendo la Estrella de Oro, los autobuses salen cada media hora a Taxco me parece..  6.- Hummm en la 6 si t fallo.. Nnca me he ido a Veracha desde Acapulco, bueno si, pero fue un viaje de la uni..

Yo tambien quiero ir a Acapulco y he investigado muchas cosas que te pueden ayudar... espero te sirvan.!!    Las lineas de bus que tienen gran frecuencia para Acapulco se llama "estrella de oro" que tienen salidas casi cada media hr saliendo desde la central sur, y si prefieres la norte tienen salidas diarias a las 11: 00 pm. El precio del boleto varia dependiendo de la clase de autobus que elijas van desde $250.00 pesos hasta $480.00 la mas cara.    De aerolineas he investigado que AVIACSA tiene salidas por las tardes desde la cd. de mxico. El boleto te cuesta aprox. $900.00 pesos desde la cd. de mxico, es muy economica a comparacion de otras aerolineas comerciales.    Me parece que lo de las terminales es por una nueva zona en desarrollo turistico que se esta creando, con villas, departamentos, casas y hoteles mas lujosos que es acapulco Diamante, no estoy segura.    Yo he ido a taxco por carretera pero hay muchas curvas :S.    y de regreso no sabria decirte... te recomiendo que llegues a la cd. de mxico pero antes informate sobre algun bus para veracruz.

i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  No I don't think Muslims can accept the Jewish person let alone the whole Jewish state.  From what I've studied they just have religious superiority issues not thinking anyone else has a right to exist, it isn't just Jews!<br>  <br>  They teach their children that Jewish people are worse, but they combine it with teachings that Islam will rule and dominate the world and they don't agree with Western laws to them it is Shariah law only. They regularly chant Death to America, Death to Israel, they've already gone into Europe and are taking over the place with violent riots and they already control 60+ Muslim states now.   It's like Hitler when he first went after the Jews but he actually had his master Aryan race plan.  The Muslims just have a "religious twist" to their beliefs. The difference is that on this campaign, it is not a war where country A declares war on country B, they are actually operating as state within a state for a hostile take over from within to spread Islam and make it dominant.<br>  <br>  When one watches this Basmallah video about how this young beautiful child is educated how to be a "devout" Muslim that hates Jews, then one will realize the Muslims have major MAJOR issues.<br>  <br>  Basmallah, victim of islam<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tlFL8r9n4Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tlFL8r9n...</a><br>  <br>  Every time a peaceful Muslim person comes along they just murder him.  They teach their children and breed the violence exponentially as they have a high birth rate. The violent ones kill off the peaceful ones they are horribly violent.<br>  ---------------------<br>  No. I still disagree even with the data of Egypt and Jordan peace treaty. If one wants to point out singular people then sure, it's possible.  But if one wants to point out if the Muslim will then be allowed to live, then it's questionable.  Heads of states sign peace treaties not religious populaces. Previous history shows Anwar Sadat of Egypt was kicked out of the Arab union then assassinated. They tried to assassinate King Hussein of Jordan because he wasn't hostile to Israel (Queen Noor attested he didn't want to fight) and in Lebanon they assassinated multiple people.  I think it is a fine line between politics by heads of state and religious populaces and things like that can change from only an assassination attempt away. I think the heads of state keep their populace "in check,."    In Jordan they still teach hate in schoolbooks despite the treaty. On Syrian maps they don't have Israel OR Jordan on the map. In Egypt Mubarak still battles with his religious populace just like Jordan does today.  While I do acknowledge there are peaceful Muslims, I said earlier  they keep killing them off. According to what is a devout Muslim by their own schoolbooks, they do not accept Israel or any other state and devout Muslims produce more children than the rest. They are not only hostile to Israel, the West but they are also hostile to each other. During the Iran-Iraq war Iran (the Khomeini nation for Islamic Revolution 1979) sent thousands of their Persian Muslim children into Iraqi mine fields armed with "plastic keys to paradise." Then Saddam never accepted Kuwait he wanted Mesopotamia back.  So tell me that they will accept Israel.  They don't even accept each other or their own lives in this world let alone a Jewish state.<br>  <br>  You want to know the true test of a Muslim can accept a Jew?  If an obviously Jewish person with kippah on goes into a predominately Muslim area and doesn't get mugged.  To me if they can accept one singlular Jew, then we would know that the mindset of Muslims has changed.|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	The conflict is not really about religion, so, yes.|`|4aveC2aaaa	i dont know if it is possible<br>  <br>  i for one palestinian muslim, do not agree with the existence of israel. call it what you may, we are all entitled to an opinion, and i stand STRONGLY with mine.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	No... ALL muslims must believe in, and obey,  allah absolutely and without exception... Allah decrees that there is only one islam, that there is only one koran as given to muhamid...

You are free to accept whatever you want. <br>  <br>  Half of these posters don't know ANYTHING about Islam. Lupines' entire post is utter crap. You cannot judge an entire religion, and entire group of people, by what an extremly small percentage does. Muslims do not teach their children to hate anything, it goes against the teachings of Islam when it comes to TOLERANCE of other religions. That's right, Islam teaches tolerance to all people, regardless of race or religion, so you people need to quit spreading hateful lies about it. <br>  Most Muslims do not support Israel because of the sh*t their doing to the Palestinians, even non-Muslims are against it! However, if a Jew is against Israel, he's called a self-hating Jew. Islam is the religion of peace, if you want to believe it, go ahead, if you don't, I don't really give a f*ck, as long as you don't post lies about it.|`|1a12b70a1ae2e90d55e3b1643b48f58baa	yes of course its possible and many many well educated Muslims are seeing the truth and fully support Israel for the Jews.<br>  Read the following sites<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Zionism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Zion...</a><br>  www.arabsforisrael.com<br>  <a href="http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2004/08/canadas-pro-israel-muslims.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.danielpipes.org/blog/2004/08/...</a><br>  Muslim Zionism is a belief among some Muslims of a Jewish State of Israel.

And by the way, we do agree that Palestine also has the right to exist and that there should be a sovereign state called Palestine as well. And we do agree that Islamic fatalism and terror has nothing to do with Islam. As well as we reject any terror acts. <br>  And to finish with that, we do not accept "Hamas" as a legal government, because we all know who they are, what they pretend and that they will bring nothing else but misery to their own people. <br>  Who does leave with freedom nowadays in Palestine? People are afraid to say what they think and prefer to hide behind silence in order to not convert into the next victims of Islamic terror (which is impulsed by their own people).<br>  I don′t make friends who support the war and killing of innocents and neither respect human rights.<br>  I don′t make friends with these radical Jewish people who believe that Palestine does not have any right to be there.<br>  And certainly I don′t have any friendship with these Muslims who do not accept that Israel has the right to exist the way it exists nowadays. <br>  I have Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist friends... <br>  I have Muslim friends from Morroco, Tunisia, Lebanon, Egypt... <br>  I am Jewish.|`|bZQ6ePUXaa	Wow, people with kind of legitimate answers, i.e. refer to some sources are thumbs down upon. (sometimes, yes, they deserve it)<br>  <br>  Well some answers say that No, but you can not inter-change the words ARAB and MUSLIM, as stated in a previous answer, compared to the rest of the world, their are not a lot of Arab muslims, actually maybe Indonesia has the most amount of Muslims, and maybe even India (small percent of a huge population adds up)<br>  <br>  The ones who say Yes, good for you, this is actually mostly a political war, but some jews, mostly Zionist, think its, or are trying to make it a religious war, mostly to spread bad press on the actual Muslims <br>  <br>  Apparently in the UN Israel is only recognized by three nations, the UK, the nation which gave the jews the lands that previously belonged to Israel, the USA for some reason, and Israel itself. The UN has made it clear that Israel, sense its formation broke most of the resolutions passed by the UN.<br>  <br>  Also, one must consider that the people of Gaza or any former person who lived in Palestine should have the right to fight back, as stated by John Locke (1632 to 1704) governments were created to protect life and that the people had a right to rebel when government violates  natural rights.|`|R76ema39aa	Yes it's fine. <br>  I have never believed this was about religion.<br>  Most muslims go against Israel because of the way Israel have treated Palestinians, and by taking the land which they believe to be Palestinian land. The ethical issue is why people are against it. They don't agree with what Israel have done in the past 60 years. Just like Jew's not living in Germany may of reacted when news came about what was happening in Germany.<br>  <br>  Tell me is right, Jews and muslims have lived togerther many years before this conflict.|`|tDyNwGdcaa	i think so.<br>  It isn't up to religion to decide whether an entire nation of people have a right to exist or not.<br>  You may not agree with the political position which gave the Israelis the land which became Israel as we know it today and that is 100% fine and 100% different from saying an entire nation has no right to exist.<br>  <br>  to a previous poster. i can't believe you just said a nation of people who were persecuted murdered and dehumanised by hitler... with hitler. thats disgusting.|`|ZyG41K8Paa	Well, when I was raised, we were shown a map of Israel only it was labeled Palestine and we were made to watch children's tv from Gaza that had furry cartoon rabbits, bees and a mickey mouse that said to be martyrs and eat jews alive.<br>  <br>  It is not possible.

Knowledgeable made a very good point!|`|AA10265786	A new hospital to the metropolitian Detroit area in West Bloomfield will bring jobs to the hospital. I can see that spending lots of money for a new hospital when the economy is not in good shape might not be a good idea, but the new hospital will bring jobs such as doctors, nurses, secretaries and cafeteria workers to work in the area. After all, many residents in Michigan are unemployed and they will take any job they can get as long as they can get a job and they do not care if they are a secretary or a janitor in a hospital, as long as they are bring in income to survive, that is what counts for them.|`|MTdMCfmlaa	Actually a new hospital will play a part in stimulating the local economy. Another thing, you say non of those jobs are "real jobs", but a lot of people in some of those positions actually get paid a decent amount per hour, if not by salary. <br>  <br>  I think you need to better educate yourself before posting a rant like this.<br>  <br>  OK, that's a weak argument. You say that about jobs in the health care field and so on. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY DUMB ***!|`|EnMB5V7eaa	I just spent this past weekend in Henry Ford West Bloomfield. It was excellent. I was treated great, the new facility looks fantastic and inviting, and I couldn't help but notice hundreds of people walking around with clipboards and lab coats or scrubs pushing people around in wheelchairs or operating radiology devices. Am I wrong in assuming these people were .. eh hmm.. at work? Wouldn't that mean they were well, at their job? <br>  <br>  No public funds are being used. The place looks nice and inviting, which makes you feel a little better entering a nice looking ER than a hut in Nepal. I take exception to your statements and feel it is you who is ignorant. <br>  <br>  Your closing argument is founded in personal opinion other than fact, because the facts are that even in a depressed economy, 3 areas get by relatively unscathed. Those 3 are: Energy, Health Care, and Food Prep.. sorry to burst your bubble, but people who are laid off still eat, need light, and heath care, regardless of the cost.|`|TskZHzZyaa	Um, yes hospitals do provide real jobs.  You live in Detroit, right.  Have you heard how the auto industry is doing?  How about K Mart?  What about the other industries in Detroit or Michigan in general?  <br>  <br>  So Detroit is probably full of a lot of retired autoworkers that sill have their good benefits, at least until the union-busting GOP finally convinces the majority to fall for their union-busting selfishness to f--- the middle class for good.  So with all those aging retirees what is the logical industry to provide jobs in Detroit?  Ah...health care!!!  Health care subsidized by those supposedly great benefits.<br>  <br>  Now you do have a good argument that those jobs may not last forever, but they will last as long as there are people that need medical services.  I think that will be for a while.  With the possible demise of the auto industry it might be sooner, but I think the hospitals will do fine for years after.<br>  <br>  So if you can think of a better idea for "real jobs" for Detroit I am certain that there are many people in that state that would appreciate the ideas.  Until then I honestly feel that medicine is your best bet.  Doctors and nurses need support staff, suppliers, and all of those people need places to go to lunch, to live, to shop.  Are those the real jobs you're talking about?

NXBmcEz7aa	Because you are a Japanese, and there is no place like home!|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	There's more to Japan than you know.|`|B2jIiOwnaa	I guess I see what bee. is trying to say.  But he should have said it better.  I'm a fan of the country myself, so I know what you mean.  Invariably, you'll find that even The Land of the Rising Sun is subject to the same downsides that are present practically everywhere else.  And although I think it's good to brace yourself for that impact, I also think you should hang on to your positivity and enthusiasm.  It can take you places--externally and internally--you never would've guessed.<br>  <br>  As for why you like Japan?  I dunno....  Personally, I'm a confirmed idealist.  Always have been.  And although I could be wrong, it seems to me that the Japanese pop mentality is also very idealistic.  So I think that as the western mindset becomes more...corrosive..there will be more of us who are drawn to Japan...<br>  <br>  Besides, who doesn't love the kawai movement?|`|0eT9mNhdaa	Its a stupid teenager phase, you will probably outcasted for this.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dont worry, in a few months or years you will look back at this phase of yours and go "Ugh!

YvNCOYZZaa	This is the travel section, but I'll help as much as I can. For future reference, there is an eBay section. <br>  <br>  'Next Day Shipping' only means that the seller promises to ship the item within 1 business day after the close of the auction.  That would most likely mean it was shipped monday.  <br>  <br>  How long it will take to get to you will depend on the type of shipping you or the seller selected, how far it needs to go, and where you are.  Try contacting your seller to request a tracking number.  This should give you a better idea.

d284622d02dab4e3b4d72af0345fd686aa	Google Monterey CA. Will take you to various sites, mainly looking for visitors' info. Will tell you some nice beaches there. Like on 17 mile drive. Going there myself in November with a friend for 3 days. Looking to do the same thing. Enjoy!|`|82918743a7b63dbb72d901bf6857be2aaa	Closest to your hotel , would be a short drive to Pacific Grove.Take the route along the ocean front ( start at the Monterey Aquarium on Cannery Row and head south. Plenty of ocean views and places to stop and relax on the rocks ( carfeul for rogue waves!) , continue down the same troute to Pebble Beach. THere you can stop at the famous LOne Cyprus Tree and enjoy the many views along this 17 mile drive. Of course for a more relaxing walk and beautiful ocean vistas, stop at CA State Park - Pt. Lobos...every turn in your walk on th emany paths bring you new views that you will never forget.While thre don't miss China Cove ...aqua blue ocean and white sand...very private beach when you decend the wooden stairs. FInally,travel down the coast to Big Sur (translates to Big South)...the best coastal views anywhere. Stop at the Big Sur River Inn for a quick bite to eat, or travel south to Nepenthe for a great terrace lunch high above the blue Pacific. If there, have the scrumptious Amrosia Burger...libation..try there home made Bloody Mary..soooo good! THereis a gift shop at Nepenthe's also, very unique items. Any ot these locations will truly bring you relaxation for the day When you retire back to the Marriot Monterey, stop by the Muck Duck Tavern ( on the same street) sit next to the indoor circular fireplace and enjoy the friendly locals and drinks in this British Pub. Enjoy!|`|AA10006474	If you have a car, head south on hwy 1 to Big Sur where you'll find some of the most amazing ocean cliffs on the planet. Big Sur is kind of a general area that starts about 10 miles south of Carmel and goes for about 50-60 miles. there are many pull-outs that overlook the ocean, and several trails. If you just want a quick taste go to Point Lobos State Reserve about 7 miles south of Monterey. There's also a recreation trail along side Monterey Bay that goes right through downtown Monterey.  have fun!|`|sA2eUpgYaa	Big Sur.    If you're renting a car, you should drive down to Big Sur, the coast south of Monterey where Henry Miller called home for several years. It's the most beautiful area where ocean and sky converge -- all of which you can see on the outer deck of Nepenthe's, a restaurant specializing in inexpensive food -- a Roast Beef au Jus sandwich will cost only $12 and it's worth it for the view alone. Across the street nearby is the Henry Miller Memorial Library.
6a9ad14604170b7a2c4a7d30429b634aaa	Hola...... mira.....    De acuerdo a mis experiencias viajando por mi pas, Mxico........ me di cuenta que el mejor mes para visitar cualquier ciudad de la Repblica Mxicana es Octubre.    Octubre es un mes muy bonito en todos lados...... En los lugares donde hace demasiado calor, para ese mes, generalmente el calor ya baj, estando el clima muy agradable, (como es el caso de Cancn u otros lugares de costa)...... ya hay menos probabilidades de que llegue un huracn, pues la mayora de ellos llegan en Septiembre...... y an no empezado la poca invernal.    Adems de que en ese mes, por no ser un mes de vacaciones, encuentras lugar en los hoteles con mayor facilidad y a precios an ms accesibles...... puedes visitar los lugares tursticos con tranquilidad pues no hay mucha gente.......... en fin....... tiene muchos beneficios viajar en ese mes.    Antes de tener hijos, mi esposo y yo cuando realizabamos un viaje a alguna ciudad de la Repblica Mxicana, lo hacamos en Octubre.    Suerte, buen viaje y bienvenida.|`|219bc811da8695ecb80179e4b64b4dc1aa	mira a mi me gusta ir a partir de la segunda semana de septiembre hasta octubre ya que es temporada baja y no hay tanta gente y gracias a dios nunca nos ha tocado mal tiemo. saludos|`|V3eqdfIDaa	te recomiendo que vayas en el mes de noviembre es cuando ya pas la poca de huracanes y todava es temporada baja por lo tanto los precios no son tan caros o si gustas de una buena fiesta en diciembre es genial pero tienes que reservar casi desde ahora y aqui te dej un video http://www.rinconesdemitierra.com/mx/vid... de cancn y sus alrededores para que no se te quiten las ganas de ir|`|RHVCK43paa	Seguro de finales de Febrero a finales de Julio   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|9cABO9xFaa	La temporada de huracanes es apartir de la tercera semana de julio hasta la segunda de octubre, pero segun los metereologos la mejor temporada para ir a la playa es en junio playas tranquilas y en temporada baja con bajos precios y buen sol, en mayo llueve mucho y en sep en adelante el clima es muy variable y es de suerte, sin duda junio es buen mes y barato, Suerte ......|`|0f848ed9a1c1e5b224f0e39a254c5a23aa	Nosotros procuramos viajar despus de las vacaciones de navidad y antes del Spring break    Que te diviertas
FlhJxOl1aa	Ok I think your responsible and mature too. You know what is good and wrong . Your parent love you and are very protective. Now to solve your problem first talk to your cousin ask her let you  go with her and ask her to ask permission from your parent. Talk to your parent that you want to go to florida, since you know it need financial for your trip. That is a hard part. If you have saving for the trip tell them. If ever do not agree or let you go keep in mind, there is a next time probable they have other reason. But I think they will if you talk to them in mature way specially if with budget for it. Since your cousin will be going with you.

Lo que te puedo contar es que la cultura de este pais es vastsima. Y en todos los ambitos. Me declaro una analfabeta en cuanto a arte, por ejemplo, y aca aprendi un monton. Aprendi que hay muchisimos artistas plasticos rusos excelentisimos y que da gusto visitar sus galerias de arte (como Zeretelli).  Empece a leer mas a los escritores rusos, y hasta visite las tumbas de Gorki y Chejov.   Me emocione cuando visite la tumba de la ultima familia real rusa, los Romanov, a quienes mataron los bolcheviques y cuyos huesos icinerados fueron encontrados hace poco.  Me quede helada cuando, en san Petesburgo, vi, en la catedral, los escalones rotos aun por las bombas de la II Guerra Mundial. Y ver la poca cantidad de hombres viejos que hay aca. Y tanta gente triste, y tanta gente alcoholica, y tantos en la calle (si, muchos mas que en mi pas, Argentina).   Ver como Rusia se esta modernizando a paso acelerado, por un lado...y ser conciente de todas las carencias que aun tiene...  La gente es...rara para un latino. Hay como dos tipos de rusos, los de "antes" del comunismo (los viejos) y los de despues. Y son diferentes, y te tratan diferente. Los "viejos" son ms cerrados, ms duros...    La verdad es que podra escribir mucho mas, no s si es esto lo que querias saber...para resumirte podra decirte que realmente vale la pena adentrase en la cultura y la historia rusa.

You may not forget, that parents depending on their Nationality have different expectation regarding schooling.    I think you should join the Expat Women &  Tods to exchange different opinions. You also may want to join their coffee times when you'll be here.

zqEBmLeuaa	It is definitely better to book separately.  Depending on where you are coming from, southwest.com and airtran.com have the best air rates I have seen.  We recently took a trip to Vegas from Indiana for $150 each round trip on airtran.  And prior to that for $200 round trip on Southwest.  Both trips were this year.    When looking for hotel deals, nothing tops http://smartervegas.com/  It lists the absolute lowest rates published by the hotels themselves.  So if you find a rate you like, the site will link you straight to the promotion on the hotel website.  Depending on what your budget is, here are my recommendations.      Harrah's- from $45/night  Tropicana- from $45/night    $50-$100  Excalibur- from $41/night  Luxor- from $55/night  MGM Grand- from $69/night  Treasure Island- from $55/night    $100 or more  Mandalay Bay- from $100/night  Caesar's- from $125/night  Bellagio- from $159/night    If you have to book in a package, the only fairly decent price I could recommend would be given by Southwest vacations.  With them you are still getting the cheap airline price, they just charge you standard rate for the hotel so you don't get any of the fabulous promotions.|`|iIo08T9kaa	I know Allegiant Air has a very competitive package.

M7n2EPMXaa	hi Basher.  Pattaya is a great place for family travel.  There are far too many attractions to list, but anything and everything is here:  aquarium, wildlife parks, elephant treks, go karting, water parks, beaches, boat rides, boat tours, video arcades, fun restaurants, reasonably priced shopping, and hundreds of other things and places to go.  All reasonably priced.   Also Mini Siam park, a few botanical gardens, and day boat trip to Koh Larn, 20 minutes by speedboat 400 baht one way, or 45 minutes by ferry boat... boats leaving from Bali Hai pier, just past Walking Street... boats leave about once an hour.   Koh Larn is beautiful, like paradise... almost.     You can also try http://www.discovery-thailand.com/Pattay... for more info, they also offer online hotel booking with discount up to 75% off.  Have a nice trip with your family.    |`|yh2hr3Vfaa	I would recommend Boracay Beach or Palawan. Phuket is nice but pricey.    Phattaya Beach is not a good wholesome family destination. The beaches are all polluted now and have been for years. Nobody with any sence would swim in that cesspool. Most of the bars there cater to the sex touring crowd. Most definately not a family destination.|`|euZRbiA2aa	plenty animal parks,tourist attractions for a family in pattaya.nighttime some bars around walking street can be bit seedy.but plenty of shopping , restaurants and normal bars like hard rock cafe.one thing every where you go in pattaya the locals will look after you  and be friendly.|`|PkyeSN9daa	Any place is what you make it.  If you want sleaze, you can find it in Pattaya.  July will be low season which means better prices.  While it might be the rainy season, it will rain hard for maybe a half hour and then the sun comes out and you get 100% humidity.  It's not all day rain.  There are plenty of activities to do with a wife and daughter in and around Pattaya.  If the daughter hasn't been overseas before it will be an eye-opening experience for her (she'll appreciate how good she has it at home).  One of the best things I like doing is watching people at beer bars (they are all over town).  It's amazing how much fun the teenagers have (even without alcohol).  The bar girls will entertain your daughter all night with games (dice, blocks, connect four), asking about what life is like back home, all kinds of things.  Even though the bar girls don't look old enough, several will have teenage kids back home they miss and will appreciate the opportunity to do things with your daughter.  Enjoy the trip.  |`|1FPTD5I5aa	It all depends on who you talk to!  There will be people who tell you to never go to Pattaya and they themselves have never been there either!     Pattaya each year tries to get more family friendly.  There are families with children who return to Pattaya year after year!  It is not unusual to see family groups walking around Pattaya.       Are there bars - sure - but no one forces you into a bar!  You probably won't see anything worse on the streets of Pattaya than you do in a beach town back in your own country.  Yes, you will see some women flaunting their evening boytoys or some foreign men walking with Thai girlfriends, so be it!        Pattaya is a top attraction for single travelers, couples and family groups - and it has been that way a long time.  Pattaya is a number one destination for tourists from Korea, Japan and China.  Many come to Pattaya because the prices are cheaper than going to Phuket.  Even the bus ride from Bangkok is only around 125 baht for a 2 hour ride.       You could choose a hotel in the Naklua area or Jomtien Beach area and avoid some of the bars.  But, the bar area also has new malls, street vendors, shops, cheaper hotels, even movie theaters (cheaper than back home.)   Royal Garden mall has an amusement arcade, movie theater and Ripleys Believe it or Not museum.    Google up "things to see and do" in Pattaya and you will get more suggestions. No one ever forces anyone into a bar!  No one holds a gun to your head and makes you do anything!  Thousands of tourists go by bars every day and are never kidnapped!  Your 16 year old daughter has probably seen more sleaze in her high school than you think!    Try it, if you don't care for Pattaya don't return.  Or, take the cheap bus back to Bangkok and pay for flights to Phuket and pay more for your hotel and transportation.  (Transportation in Pattaya City is only 10 baht!)    Have a pleasant trip.|`|0bPJnvFFaa	I reckon that Pattaya is an ideal place for a family holiday. Okay I am not married any more but I would have had no hesitation bringing my wife and kids here and I know they would have enjoyed it. Although Pattaya gets in the region of a million visitors a year it is presently a bit of a Russian Family secret...they all bring their families.    There is lots to do as a family and I am sure that your daughters eyes will be opened if you do the tourist thing and go down Walking Street at night.    Pattaya can be sleazy but it is good clean sleaze. I say go for it!    I don't understand people who condemn Pattaya.    Visit this site...you will find it useful.   http://www.pattayahome.net/home/    Take a look at day activities....will you have enough time?  http://www.pattayahome.net/home/day-acti...    |`|smyrGGvCaa	As a family destination Pattaya is not the place, yes has plenty of shopping, there are some sites to see, but yes a seedy place, dependent on what you want to do going to one of the islands may be better for you...Koh Chang, Koh Samet, Phi Phi, Chang Mai etc.....by all means do a day trip/couple of days in Pattaya, but dont spend your whole holiday there..there are far better places|`|e8hINcbBaa	I have been to Phuket several times and never been to Pattaya.   Personally I would say Phuket is a better place, that is based on what I have heard of Pattaya, which is indeed notorious as a seedy place.     This year I went to Phuket for a few days during July as well and though it is the monsoon season, it is not raining every day and not all day. If it rains, it might be just a couple of hours of tropical rain, but the weather is oherwise quite pleasant and warm.     The advantage of going in July is that you can get a good hotel for about half the price you would pay for it in the high season and the other advantage is that it won't be so crowded with tourists everywhere.     Phuket has several activities, that you can do during the monsoon season as well - like scuba diving / snorkeling (though not at all dive sites during low season, you can still do great dives at Racha Islands as a day trip from Phuket), do a tour to the Phang Nga Bay, Phi Phi island, go canoeing, or land activities as well, jungle trekking, elephant ride, etc.     And after all the activities, enjoy a nice dinner (European, steaks, Italian, Japanese and of course Thai cuisines), get a Thai massage, foot massage, etc. And don't forget the shopping (but bargain hard at the street stalls).     Go for a hotel with swimming pool, though you can sit at the beach too, if there is a strong current, they will put up signs that you shouldn't swim in the sea.     I stayed at Thara Patong Beach Resort, which was pretty good and value for money during July.       And if you are flying in to Bangkok, I would recommend to book a flight from there straight on to Phuket when you arrive. On your way back, stay a few days in Bangkok to do some sightseeing there - if you've never been there before. Bangkok can be overwhelming, as it's a pretty crowded and polluted city. Must see there: the Golden Palace and Wat Pho temple ...   |`|JPgC95I7aa	for good family fun i would reccomend jomtiem beach area which is about 3 miles from pattaya and is more family orientated than pattaya but pattaya has some excellent restaurants plenty of varied nightlife and is only a 20 baht bus ride to get there from jomtiem, there is plenty to do like visit nong nook gardens sirachi tiger zoo, the elephant village,sea fishing diving spend a day on the little islands off the coast a nice little island to spend a few days is ko samet which is 1 and a half hours from pattaya and a boat ride of half hour unless you pay extra and go by speedboat across a good place to relax and get your energy back ko chang is also a beautiful island and is about 4 hours minibus ride away from pattaya you can book your stay in advance from any travel agent in pattaya or jomtiem hope this helps a bit
bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	Well the whole island has many beautiful places to spend a nice vacation, but is you like beaches with white sand and beautiful sunsets the town of Rincn is for you. Rincn had been recognized with the award of the place with the most beautiful sunsets all around the world. You have places like Culebra, very nice for snorkeling. The advantage you have is that you can stay in a hotel nearby the airport, but you are able to visit the whole island since places aren't to far from each other. Take a look and get more info in www.placestogo.com    Rainbow if you can't answer a question, don't do it, in just one day you can't say how good is Puerto Rico. I been here all my life and I'm still finding things to explore yet, something new to do every weekend. Is like go to New York for just one day, take a look of the Statue Of The Liberty and then say New York is boring because all it has is that, come on, you must base your comment in real bases. I invite you to come to Puerto Rico for a longer time than just a day and then you tell me.|`|iyRczu0eaa	I'd go to somewhere in the caribbean. It's gorgeous on some of those islands.

It is located in Rio Grande, PR and Is very fancy and nice. There is a ton to do and it has around 12 resturaunts, multiple large pools, a huge beach and much to see around the area. Fun things include snuba, the El Yunke rainforest and the camuey caves as well as the beach. I have personally been here and had a great time.

7K2gAntraa	It will be really hot and humid.  The temperature during the day will be in the high 90's and with the heat index it will make it feel like it is over 100 degrees.  Nights will be hot as well with temps. around 85.  Everybody thinks it's too hot, but hey it's what Cancn is.  It's awesome weather to me.  There is always a chance of a pop-up shower because Cancn is right on the ocean and that in return brings high levels of humidity, but it rarely happens.  If it does rain it is literally only for a few minutes to no more than an hour and usually the sun is still out while it's raining...known as sun showers, which are very common in Cancn. So, if you like hot, tropical weather that is what you will be in for.  Enjoy your time!!!|`|AA10042296	July 10th will be sunny and hot most of the day.

La peor respuesta que te han dado es en la que te dicen que te van a asaltar y que te vayas a El Caminante. Si tienes las recomendaciones bsicas de seguridad nadie te va a asaltar si el taxi del aeropuerto te deja en la puerta de la terminal de autobuses. Adems la lnea Caminante no va a Quertaro.    Lo mejor es que tomes un taxi a la central de Toluca (en el aeropuerto tienen tarifa fija). En la central hay una lnea que se llama Autovas (azul con verde). Sus autobuses estn muy bien, nuevos.

AA11341587	No.  Alberta drinking age is 18, and it's 18 for everyone who is in Alberta drinking.  They will be happy to serve you as long as you have government issued ID.  I see US under 21 drinkers all the time in Vancouver bars.    The main scenario close to the situation you describe is when boarder town kids cross into Canada or Mexico and get drunk and come back home that night.  They are then a Intoxicated Minor in the US and breaking laws of the US.   But if you are Edmonton, it's not like you are going all the way back the night you are drinking.|`|azypqsphaa	actually it's now 25 for americans and 19 for everybody else, apparently it's based on maturity levels...|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Actually in Alberta the drinking age is 18.

On weekends and when they are closed they have large parking lots, and often roads that run around the campus.

1rFYElOnaa	My boyfriend and I (both 23 years old) just got off our very first cruise and we went on Royal Caribbean and we had a blast!!!!! It was the most fun we have had together in such a long time. We literally got back from our cruise 2 weeks ago and we're already planning our second cruise! We found that Royal Caribbean was very neat, food was AMAZING, staff was unbelievably friendly, hardly any kids, drinks were very tasty, the casino was a blast (i came up ahead), and there was always so much stuff to do. I haven't ever been on Carnival so I can't compare them but I was talking to a couple on our Royal Caribbean cruise and they said they've been on Carnival and it's nowhere as nice as Royal Caribbean.    But, I guess a cruise is a cruise..You'll have so much fun no matter what you choose! :) Hope this little bit helped you and enjoy!|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Wow and I thought I was longwinded.  The real truth of the matter--they are both budget lines so if school is out you will have a lot of kids.  Only way to avoid that is to go in May when you get out of school.    However you can't book Carnival.  Someone has to be 25 in order to book with them.  Royal Caribbean is fine if at least one person is 21.  So...I'd go with them. =)    Royal Caribbean is a great line.  It's definitely not for old people though so find out what ship they were on and avoid that one.  RC has more honeymooners though than Carnival and definitely more romantic.  RC has rockclimbing walls and tons of shore excursions that are high activity.  Read the daily newspaper for everything that is going on on the ship that day.  Check out the spa.  Spa is cheaper on port days plus they often have advertised specials.  By the last day at sea, the cost is much cheaper.      You will have a great time!    Edit:    It does say on the Carnival webpage that its ok if you are both over 21 though when I booked my honeymoon at 24, the agent asked how old my fiance was first and if there would be someone 25 in my stateroom.  I was shocked.  On NCL, I had a cabin with my cousin when we were both 20 even though we were suppose to be 21 (though his parents were on board).  The policy could have changed since then though.    If you can book with Carnival, I'm a huge fan of it.  It is a party boat and I personally love them.  Carnival is more party oriented; Royal Caribbean is more couples and more romance.  Personally I'd go with which one does the itinerary that you like best.   After all the ship isn't as important as where you are going.  Find a price and an itinerary you like and if you are torn between two ships, see which one is the newer ship.  A newer ship (or newer renovated ship) is always prettier.  Either way you are guaranteed to have a GREAT time on either line!|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Laylani>3    OK!  First Cruise, In lieu of your age I will assume shared expense with the probability of credit cards being taken out for more exercise than a trip too "Wal Mart"!    Your shopping a big ticket item and "shopping" in the key word!  Not unlike the purchase of a car or realestate it is best to have a professional that you and your boyfriend feel comfortable with.  Remember it's not the questions you ask but the questions you don't ask that generally end up "alacarte" at sea prices.    Laylani    Logical reasoning:    The travel agent will bring to life the pamplets you've read on both cruise lines while having the ship's deck plans and cabin availability ready to close the deal. Remember it is the process, you don't have to lay out the credit card until you feel comfortable and at the same time your learning how your boyfriend deals with professional decision making, you can take an evening to think it over. (Laylani are we having fun yet?) Outside staterooms are always a priemium, however; if your expecting to spend afternoons in your stateroom, ordering room service or bolstering the complimentary continental breakfeast it is well worth the additional priemium.     Heads up on the contract in relation to the following:    1. Travel arrangements and ground transportation expense to and from the Airport or Hotel your staying at prior to embarkation.    2. Tipping in relation to your luggage being delivered to your stateroom and policies should your luggage not arrive at all. (professional detailing, hence travel agent) nothing worse than having to purchase your clothing at the onboard gift shop in order to attend the Captains welcome onboard!    3. Tipping policy in general are only guide lines, believe me the room stewards, bus boys and waiters all have "spidy" senses in relation to those who are going to take care of them and those who are going to short change them. They live for their tipsl.    (However you can have some cash on hand because you've already dealt with the professional travel agent who has prepared you and your boyfriend for the entire cost of this "Shared" vacation experience.)  Check with your credit card company to see if your eligible for Air Miles etc. associated with booking a cruise. If you are a member of AAA Ref: American Automible Association see what discounts they offer. Shop it!! Shop it!! and be absolutely shameless about wanting a deal, however a deal on the over all experience, with all the bases covered.     Now!Take Some Cash and Throw it Around!!      Example: Your boyfriend wants a little extra attentention from the bartender in the night club you enjoy dancing at after hours, buy directly at the bar , learn thier first name and tip them $20.00 at the begining of the cruise.  Carry some cash and spread it around the second day aboard and you'll be taken care of while others are waiting on their Waitress.  In the dinning room ask to speak to the Matri D and  $50.00 will make that window seat for two suddenly appear as if buy magic, if not he\she will be certain to sit you away from "The Brady Bunch". Request second seating in the dinning room so you can remain in the sun longer and you'll find that eating lunch is far superior in the dinning room than the "Deck Lunch"!    Ok! I think I have earned some "creds", check your local library for some terrific books out on "Cruise Lines for the Holiday Traveler" they are readily available.    Now for what they don't tell you!    Be wary of the Entertainment Cruise Staff they sometimes have been known to enjoy making sport out of young "nuebies" like yourselves, musicians inclusive!    Have Fun!|`|ffJfKTrHaa	Don't want kids around?  Then avoid Carnival.      My family has gone on both Royal and Carnival.  We enjoyed both very much.    Royal was an older crowd.  Literally, one of the activities on board was napkin folding!  Bingo and Karoke, also.  Food was great!!  Excurisions were good, too.  (I think they would be equal on either cruise line.)  We especially liked the dancing after hours.    Carnival was younger, and included kids.  Although the children have their own activities, they are also in the pool and around.  (It was fine for us because one of our family was a young child.)  Food also was very good.  There didn't seem to be as much to do after hours.  (Also, my neighbors recently went on Carnival and said they were a little shy on staff and the food was bad.)    All that said, cruises are my all-time favorite vacations!  You are together with your family all the time.  No one has to drive or sit in the back seat.  You eat all you want and don't have to pay after dinner.  You just have fun and enjoy each other!  You'll have a great time, I'm sure, whichever line you decide to go with.  Enjoy!    p.s. Formal night was fun.  People will be wearing anything and everything, so wear what you like.  We went to the nightclub dancing after the formal dinner and had a wonderful time dancing and looking great!|`|q1GnMRxxaa	To go on Carnival, you would have to be 25 or your boyfriend would have to be at the very least. On Royal Caribbean, 22 is just fine as well as on Princess. Besides that, if you want to avoid kids, Carnival would not be a good choice.BTW, I prefer Princess, but I know lots of people that prefer Royal too.|`|S0uCKptBaa	I have cruised with royal caribbean and carnival and prefer royal caribbean. My first cruise was with carnival and it was so bad that it turned me off of cruising for a long time. Their cruises are very affordable but they don't offer much in the way of activities. Also the service and food are not good at all, and the ships are dated. Since then I have cruised with royal caribbean and I love it. On carnival I hated the sea days because I was bored, there was nothing to do. On royal there are so many activities that you can't do everything you want to do. They have so much from salsa lessons, to ice skating to wine tastings. You stay busy. Also they had great nightlife, on the carnival ship there was no nightlife, just karaoke. Also their ships are big but never feel crowded. They have a lot of activities for kids so a lot of times you won't see any except at meals and at the ports. They also offer a good mix of people. The couple of cruises I have been on with them has had a lot of young people. As a first cruise you can't go wrong with royal caribbean.|`|1yqucDzaaa	You only have to be 21 to go on a cruise. My fiance & I went when we were 22. This was Carnival's rule. I don't know about Royal Caribbean. I would suggest Carnival- I've done 2 carnival cruises and about to go on another for a honeymoon. Yes there were kids- but I didn't see a ton- I mean we didn't really do things where we would see a lot of kids. It's a ton of fun!! I know a few people who went on Royal Caribbean and said it was horrible, bad shows, and bad food- I've never been on one so I don't know, but we stick with carnival! I think it's definitely geared towards a younger crowd and it's a "fun ship." Have fun!!!|`|43885d249f6e12d0c9543cbcbaffc9bbaa	I've always used Princess but heard that Royal is very good.  Also heard that often there are children on the Carnival lines ships.|`|B0ypUuHXaa	I have been on a Royal ship once, but we are doing another one in Easter. Obviously I cannot compare them, but I found the cruise very nice. Although there were quite a few children, and I think there always will be, the children's club was like a free babysitting service. I went to it as I was 11, and during the day, there were craft activities, and at lunch time they took you down to the swimming pool restaurant, but at night, there were so many good things to do. So the number of children running around was reduced because it was so popular. I know I don't know anything about Carnival, but I would recommend Royal.|`|kyFDyHOpaa	if you don't want party people you should go on royal caribbean

uCr1uiIuaa	Boston provides a great deal of entertainment.  It does have a high number of schools, many of them with fantastic reputations, a strong tie to American history, especially Colonial America, and a strong commercial core, though most recently the economy has slowed immensely.  It's a good, moderately-sized, and relatively safe city.|`|f9wQ8RcAaa	Where did you hear all this? A Boston vacations flyer? If your coming to Boston, bring some money...lost of it because the cost of living is outrageous. And be prepared for the fact the Massachusetts will wage war on whatever car you own. Why do you think Mass is the only state that LOST population in 2007? I'm trying to get out while I still can, and you want to come here? Sure, Boston is a great city if you have the money and don't mind a corrupt state government that is constantly thinking of new an innovative ways to tax the snot out of the public. Oh, and the people are about as friendly as a starving pit bull.|`|YbyX6qUEaa	Boston is a fantastic state. It has the best school (Harvard).. Some of the best hospitals in the world. Great sports teams, great atmosphere all around!     Yes it can be a bit pricey, but that all depends on where you live. You can find cheaper places if you look or check craigslist.    Also, you don't NEED a car, unless you live outside the city. Boston has one of the best transit systems, so you'll be fine to get around!    Hope you consider it.!!|`|mAV5MJQnaa	I don't think much has changed. Populations changes and maybe prices can change, but other then that, you don't find much of a difference.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Boston is a mid-size city with a population of 580,000.    Boston is surrounded by other cities like: Cambridge, Brookline, Newton, and Quincy, but these are not Boston.    Boston has a high crime area called Roxbury and Mattapan (murder pan) and the Orange Line trains lead to these dangerous areas.  Otherwise the rest of Boston is O.K.    Boston was made up of ethnic neighborhoods but the white flight from Forced busing and condo displacement has emptied them - now all these safe ethnic neighborhoods have been gentrified and extremely expensive.  Boston has lost 43,000 residents in the past 15 years due to white flight and condo displacement.    The Boston Public Schools are now 86% black & hispanic and have been labled "dysfunctional" by the New England Board of Education; Boston has some excellent colleges but they are all flaming liberal.    Travel is convenient in Boston as you have the choice of: buses, trains, trolleys, taxis, or walking.  Boston is small enough to walk just about anywhere (just stay away from the high crime areas mentioned above.).|`|nZmLycrXaa	A lot of winning sports teams: Red Sox, Celtics, and Patriots. Plus you got the duck tours and "Cheers" too!|`|joMMrN7Daa	It has lots of Colonial history with a European feel yet has a large city advantage. Might be moving there for college.|`|G0m2kONTaa	Boston is a very big city in a very constraining locale - its central area is surrounded by water, and the whole city is pressed up against the coast with lots of suburbs all around it.    There is literally nowhere for it to expand....yet it somehow becomes a bigger city with more people and more (slow) development.    If there's ever a city in America that somehow builds levels atop itself in order to keep expanding and growing, it's Boston.|`|ncojw5ttaa	Boston is full of history. It's one of the oldest cities in the US. It's considered the unofficial "Capital of New England." Some major events include the Boston Massacre, American Revolution, and the Boston Tea Party. We have tons of colleges including Harvard, which was the first US college. And the first subway system (we call it the T). The population in 2007 was estimated to be 608,352. Read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston    But the best thing of all about Boston is the sports! Boston sports fans are so dedicated to their teams. We have the Red Sox, Pats, Celtics, Bruins. And we have Fenway Park, the oldest baseball field. Nothing beats baseball games at Fenway, especially against the Yankees! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_spor...    And nothing can compare to the Boston accent. We do not pronounce our R's and most of us don't even realize it. Pahk the cah in havid yahd. Love it! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_acce...    Boston is simply gorgeous, especially in the fall. We are right on the Charles River and also a city away from Revere Beach, the first public beach. And you will not find Italian food anywhere as good as you will in the famous North End. If you haven't yet visited Boston, I hope I have convinced you to!

Try meetin.org, 214area.com, meetup.com or I changed my myspace zip code a month before I moved and stated on my profile that I would be moving to the area. That one was the most effective.

pm2EeEgiaa	Year 2009:<br>  <br>  "Taong Dalawanglibo't-siyam" (Tagalog)<br>  "Taong Dos Mil Nuebe" (Spanish)<br>  <br>  Both are understood quite well, with the Spanish version being popular among radio announcers. <br>  <br>  Among friends and family in Manila and urban areas, the English term "two thousand nine" is the most popular to use. You use the Tagalog version only among rural folk.|`|9VsVJ7djaa	Sometimes a single english word has a long translation in Tagalog, U see, tagalog or (Filipino as the official language) has been a mixture of several asian, spanish and even english words.<br>  Monday        -  Lunes<br>  Tuesday       -  Martes<br>  Wednesday  -  Miyerkules<br>  Thursday      -  Huwebes<br>  Friday          -  Biyernes<br>  Saturday      -  Sabado<br>  Sunday        -  Linggo<br>  <br>  In months, the translation is basically spanish-- enero, pebrero, marso,abril and so on...<br>  <br>  The translation for the year is a little bit complex. 2009 is `taong dalawang libo at siyam`.<br>  <br>  Taon or taong     -   year or in the year<br>  dalawa               -   two<br>  libo                    -   thousand<br>  siyam                -   nine<br>  <br>  A bit of advice, if you want to say to an ordinary filipino the complete date with day, month and year, just say it in english because almost all filipinos understand english especially calendar dates. Dont say it in complete tagalog translation or they might find it funny and unusual. Most probably they will laugh at you. Good Luck.|`|lemCTR2Waa	Just say it in English, most Filipinos do it instead of the cumbersome Tagalog. You are better understood that way.|`|OxS3UVE6aa	Dalawang libot at siyam. Dalawa is two. Libo is Thousand and siyam is 9.|`|h6ZR61e3aa	2009 in Tagalog is dalawang libo at siyam. dalawa is 2, libo is the Tagalog term for thousand and siyam or syam is 9.<br>  1 = isa<br>  2 = dalawa<br>  3 = tatlo<br>  4 = apat<br>  5 = lima<br>  6 = anim<br>  7 = pito<br>  8 = walo<br>  9 = siyam<br>  10 = sampu<br>  <br>  note that when a number ends in a vowel the letters "ng" are added to denote the numbers connection to the next word like in 2009 (dalawang libo at siyam). when the number ends in a consonant the Tagalog word "at" usually follows the preceeding number (e.g. 4001 = apat na libo at isa).|`|FBAmSYKKaa	Hi! I am from the Philippines and TAGALOG is our national language. You say: Taon ika-dalawang libo at siyam."Taon" = year, "(ika)-dalawang libo" = 2000, "at" = and, "siyam" = nine. Email me if you want more translations in Tagalog or Cebuano/Visayan/Bisaya, the filipino dialect that I speak at home. Tagalog is spoken by filipinos from the northern part, while Cebuano/Visayan/Bisaya from central and southern Philippines. We have many dialects in between, though. If you come to my country, you won't get lost! More than 80% of the Filipino population can speak and understand english.

mRLYY14Yaa	Gee I didn't know human rights was so bad in China until...the media told me it was so bad. I've stayed in China on and off for a while and have experienced nothing different than here in the States as far as personal freedom went. Opposite in fact, I saw people go up to the police in China and curse them out while the police just stood there, while in NY, I saw NYPD kick and punch out people over trivial things or even NOTHING other than being drunk and mumbling at cops, let alone try cursing. <br>  As for working for low wages and being unfair, I think people need to step outside of their Ivory towers and open their eyes to reality. Because of all the demands of our Unions, jobs have left America. And really who do you think is doing all the work that no one wants in America? Illegal immigrants! Ha, many don''t even get minimal wage and many live in crammed housing like cockroaches.<br>  You know there are many people in China who now lament that China is too free! At least under Communism they were guaranteed a job, now it's each man for him/her self. People are not forced to work, they work if they don't want to starve. As for children working, in some areas, it's very poor still, would it be better for them to sit there and starve to death instead?? Perhaps they should act like Africa and beg?<br>  In America we are not as free as you think. In China it is not as not free as people think. Of course in China, one main difference is you better not stand up against or be caught conspiring against the govt, deal drugs or anything seriously criminal. Because then there's hell to pay. You know that may not be such a bad thing, maybe we'd have less crime in the USA if we followed suit. It's sure a lot safer to stroll down the street at night in a big city in China than in NY any day/night!|`|xvtufc7faa	I don't think importing products from China have anything to do with human rights in China.<br>  <br>  I'm Chinese, and we do have our own rights in China. Other people from other countries are always complaining about human rights in China, but have they ever lived here? To be honest, we make a lot of our decisions now in China. Everyone can do whatever they want as long as you're not doing something stupid. When you're watching the news, do you ever see the own Chinese people going on strike? No, because its always the people who's against the government or from other countries. Some people from Tibet, Tawaian, and Hong Kong are always the one who's against the Chinese government due to the fact that they were independent. But the monks in Tibet, do others know how they survive? It's because the Chinese government give money to them each month. But they're the ones who started that strike last year killing hundreds of innocents. <br>  <br>  I honestly don't see what's wrong living in China and being a Chinese citizen because I'm proud of it. I think others should try to visit China and visit this beautiful country.|`|1LlhqADoaa	western medias always distort the facts,<br>  OR Only report the negative things,ignore positive things .in each nation,There are good and bad things.You must have an open and equal mind to them.<br>  I admit that we chinese can learn many things from you westerners.<br>  But this doesn't mean that you can blame us in a very unfair way,and make some baseless accusations.<br>  <br>  Another  you are saying "children are made to work "............<br>  where you get to know this?<br>  All children are in the school. <br>  they dont need pay any tuition untill they graduate from middle school. <br>  SO Why not stay at school?|`|TXaMOQo6aa	i think they should stop importing stuff but the U.S. probably are not able to make their own goods as good as the Chinese, besides, I think the U.S. will be too stubborn or lazy to do that. but that's just my opinion.|`|vHpoGpQYaa	Thousands of the world's biggest corporations from USA, Europe, Asia are operating in China because it is cheaper to produce their products there and therefore increase their profit margins tremendously. And there is NO WAY IN HELL that these thousands of corporations will pull out of China just because self-serving people with their own agendas and ulterior motives say China's human rights need to improve.<br>  <br>  And there is NO CHANCE in hell that consumers in the USA, Europe and elsewhere in the world will stop buying made-in-China just because some people think that China's human rights need to improve.<br>  <br>  Corporations exist only to make money, lots of it; "human rights" is none of their concern.<br>  <br>  Btw children are NOT made to work. China's democracy has to serve the nation's objectives and not the minority; western-style democracy is NOT suitable for China and other countries; therefore the west go all out to criticize China's human rights record based from their viewpoint of democracy.<br>  <br>  China's social order and harmony must prevail in order that economic activities can flourish.|`|4HJMgQUDaa	I think that aside from yourself, most people don't think about where their toys or shoes or leather jackets come from.

In all honesty, I never thought to look.<br>  <br>  More than that, most of us in the Western world are so far removed from the way people live in other countries that it is very easy to just ignore the problem.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you asked this question.  I recommend you read some of Naomi Kleine's[1] work.  She wrote a book called "No Logo" that sheds some light on the plight of Chinese sweatshop workers.|`|d52d762550191151e6a8c64945c375f6aa	importing things from china is cheaper, because of the low labor fees there.|`|YBbumuyFaa	You are right. We should stop importing from them to put pressure on them to improve.<br>  <br>  But this theory is eons apart from practicalities. You cannot just ignore one sixth of humanity living in China. If we don't import surely they will get many other nations who are ready to do business with them and human rights does not figure so high on their priorities list.<br>  <br>  And there are business interests as well. We as consumers buy what's available. But the businessmen who are interested in maximising their bottom line choose to outsource their manufacturing to to China. They too don't have much thought about morality. Haven't you heard of Yahoo and Google compromising their mission and vision statements to please the communist party of China?|`|TDjlNgrGaa	making a product has nothing to do with human rights. Just because they can produce toys, it doesn't mean it correlates with human rights.<br>  <br>  I'm an american, but lived in china for several years (dad worked at the military abroad). The human rights is not as bad as what people in america believe. The american media is putting propaganda to brainwash the public because they want you to believe communism is horrible. The chinese people have very fair laws and the people are happy (about the government, at least). <br>  <br>  BUT it is the Tibetens that are unhappy (which are the monks and the western part of china). They were their own country, but china took over them a long time ago. Now they want independence, but china says no (it's the same as hawaiians saying that they no longer want to be a part of America). Tibetien monks protested without a warrent, so the chinese government fought back and the clips of it are all over youtube, making china seem (in the eyes on america) an evil place. This is not the case. It is no different than the LA riots over here in america. <br>  <br>  Don't be a confromist to the american propaganda. America wants everyone to believe that anything besides themselves are evil and unjust. Imagine how the rest of the world views us? lol probably worst

The passport card is cheaper, by close to $100 and if you are going by car or foot that is all you will need; if you want to fly in you need a passport. You need your birth certificate, license and need to know your social security number, but do not need th card with; and also need to know both parents date of birth and were they were born.

They hate black people because they believe they introduced alot of diseases and crime. (Africans) blah blah blah    God they even hate themselves.

Sooner or later, they'll learn and we will all live in harmony...someday    I guess the young nationalistic Koreans still hate Japanese people.

Just like how you see some old people in America disliking Japan because of Pearl Harbor, but you never see younger people in America disliking Japan (unless they're just racist to all Asians).|`|fYFNTbHbaa	if they hated Japan, then why do most of the sushi stores are owned by Koreans?

What you see on the screen was the second attempt to film the area, the first time the helicopter went out and was hit by a freak wave, and while all the people got out of it, the helicopter is apparently still there in the sea, mind you by now it's probably in bits because of the strong currents there.

I dont know where you could get dressed up and go there but i do know you could pop over the mnt to cherokee and gamble you can rent a cabin through www.cabinsforyou.com  starting at 75.00 a night less the 500.00 a week for some of them or you could stay  at a motel for less then 300.00 a week {during the winter only]you could have some of your meals in your room and take advantage of the breakfast at the motel.there are coupons every where that you could use to save more money and remember some of the best things in life are free|`|RrEESD6Paa	Whatever you do, book your flight, hotel, and car together. It will be much cheaper.     How about Atlantic City, New Jersey? Great casinos.    Las Vegas? I guarantee you that you can find something in your budget there.     Check out BookMe dot com. You can compare ALL the reputable travel sites from one location, and save tons of money. Good luck!|`|vfqaiqvfaa	Ok, this could be a long shot....but, have you considered going on a cruise to the Bahamas?  I know it's a little last minute, but alot of cruises right now are under $300.00 per person for 3 or 4 nights and it includes your food and entertainment...AND there's a casino on the ship!  No need to go to Vegas =)  AND you'd have the formal night on the ship for dinner, so you'd get to dress up as well!  So, if you could find some cheap flights into Orlando, Ft. Lauderdale, or Miami, you may be able to pull it off within your budget.  Also, I think right now with cruises to the Bahamas a passport is not necessary and only requires your original birth certificate (or certified copy) and your ID.  Anyway, it's only a suggestion, but I'd consider it =)  Good Luck!

ZcpUrwI1aa	Daily Candy's website gives you good fashion info- including sample sales, etc. 7th, 8th and 9th avenues between 32nd and 38th is probably the best area to find good shopping- Also good is the area below Delancey on the lower east side for bargains. Yes, go to 5th ave and see all the high end shops for fun too, but the bargains are on the side streets.     New York is full of great restaurants. Just be prepared to spend some money if you go for something more well known. There are less expensive places too but they don't have the big names. You have to be willing to chance it. Still, I have rarely had a bad meal in NY.   If you like Latin food with a twist, my favorite restaurant is Rayuela (on Allen btw Rivington & Stanton).   Les Halles is great for laid back bistro food and not too pricy.   Casa Mono has great tapas and is one of the many Mario Batali owned places in the city- you can't go wrong with any of them.  Thalassa is good Greek/mediterranean food  Amalia is good but expensive and the bar D'Or is fun too. Just go in to take a look at the place. The decor is amazing.   Le Souk is fun- eat dinner there and then stay for drinks and dancing to middle eastern music.  For an authentic and cheap dim sum weekend brunch in Chinatown, Jing Fong is great.   Pop Burger is great for middle of the night mini burgers and fries  Another middle of the night favorite is Mamoun's Felafel, in the village, which is a great area with lots of fun bars and restaurants. The W 4th St. subway stop is kind of the epicenter.  You can also check out what's left of little Italy on Mulberry St.   You can go to South Street Seaport and do some sight seeing and then cross the Brooklyn Bridge to go to Grimaldi's (literally right by the bridge) for pizza, then go next door for ice cream.     For clubs, check out David Jaffee's suggestions. If you sign up and get on his list (it's free), you get free or discounted admission as well as drink deals at some of the best places in the city. I know his site looks a little homemade, but he is for real- I have gone out with girlfriends using his list several times and never had a problem and I have met him at one of his parties and he is a gracious host.|`|g8LLIeXKaa	Herald Square is a great area to go shopping.  Since it is February, it will still be cold in the city.  Very tall building like the Empire State building helps to block out some  of the sun and since we are near the coast, when the breeze blows through, it can be chilly.    Times Square is NOT the place to go shopping. BIG tourist rip-offs.    If you have a BIG budget and plan to get a lot of things, carry an empty travel bag on wheels so you can tote them around easier while walking.    Speaking of walking, don't forget to wear comfortable shoes.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Listed below are some excellent restaurants you should definitely try out.

However, I did find a website where you can find some different places to shop, and you can narrow it down with what you want to shop for: http://www.ny.com/shopping/  Remember that these shops can be anywhere in the city, so be willing to go to Queens if need be.|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, if you're looking for some discounted items, may I recommend the Woodbury Common Premium Outlets, located in Central Valley, NY. There mall is located about an hour from Manhattan, but I hear it is the best place to find closeout item at a budget.    There are two ways to get there.    Option 1 - you can take a Gray Line New York motor coach directly to the mall. They depart from the Port Authority Bus Terminal several times. Full information on obtaining ticket are found at the link below.    Option 2 - You can take NJ Transit from Penn Station to Harriman where a shuttle bus will take you from the train station to the mall.    In regard to restaurants in New York City, well, that depends on you price range and you taste. This city has millions of restaurants and there is a very helpful link below that will help you out. You can choose by either location, price range or cuisie.    I hope this information is very helpful.    Good luck  Native New Yorker|`|qdzz6ZJkaa	If you love shopping , then a trip to the Woodbury Common outlets is a must    http://www.citysightsny.com/page.php?id=...

cxNLOPHNaa	If there's something that you really want to see, and especially any Cirque du Soleil show, get there just before opening, then snap up your tickets as soon as possible. Any available Cirque tickets go fast!<br>  <br>  However, if you just want to see any show, for something to do that night. Late afternoon is the time to go. They post slightly deeper discounts closer to show time, but not on every show.|`|Tb1LvlhBaa	Whatever you do don't see Believe by Criss Angel and Cirque du Soleil. I saw it on Saturday at 9:30pm and it was horrible and boring. My friends and I went to tix4tonight at around 12pm that same day, there was a small line but we still were able to buy 7 tickets. The Luxor was not packed there is always seating because they have more than 1 show a night.|`|j7vfbwVUaa	They actually open at 11am but the shows for the day are posted at 9:30am. My advise is to get there at 9:30 and if your shows are on the list, stand in line right away. There are no guarantees Cirque du Soleil show tickets will be on sale but there is no way to find out until that morning.|`|xif22nwoaa	If there is a show that you really want to see, show up at 9:30 when they post the day's listings and see if your show is one of them for sale that day.  If so, stay in line.  Cirque tickets tend to go quickly.  But there is a chance that they won't have any tickets for the show you want to see.  If it's something that you really want to make sure you can catch, it's best to buy the tickets in advance.  But Tix4Tonight is fantastic if you're open to seeing any show.

G2h8g2g1aa	Your best bet is to stay at a hotel in the Loop and take the CTA trains or buses to Moody: <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF8&q=moody+bible+chicago&fb=1&split=1&gl=us&cid=0,0,729069129862529412&ei=aeulScCSCpDZnQeI6dWdBQ&ll=41.898476,-87.632232&spn=0.00805,0.013733&z=16" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&ie=UTF...</a>  The Brown Line, Red Line and #22 & #36 buses are very conveinent to Moody...in fact the buses drop you off right in front.  <br>  <br>  You can save money if and only if you drive your own car to a hotel in the burbs, and drive to Moody.  Taking the Metra makes no sense because you're going to either have to drive or take a cab to the Metra (money for your cab or for parking), and Metra is more expensive (and less convenient) than the CTA.  <br>  <br>  So realisitically the only way to save money is to bring your own car and stay in the burbs.  Otherwise it all evens out so you may as well make it more convenient for yourself and stay downtown.<br>  <br>  I would look into: <br>  Hotel Monaco, Crown Plaze, Hyatt Regency, Palmer House, Hotel Burnham, Hapton Inn (on Madison) or the Sax (which is just north of the River).  Book now so you can get a good rate, and check a few sites like Hotels.com or Expedia.com.|`|hel4ebsoaa	Yes you can staty outside of Chcago proper near the Metra lines . These trains will take you directly into the city at either Union Station or Ogilvey Station. Neither one of them are convenient to the Moody Bible INstitue ( assumeing that you are going there for the conferences) HOwever at that point you can take the CTA ( Chicago subway system trains) or a taxi. <br>  <br>  Be sure to get a hotel near the MEtra lines if you stay outside og CHcago. Also be sure to factor in all the issues before you jump  to the conclusion that living outside of Chcago will be cost efective. Finally when you analyze all teh cost comparativley be sure to factor in your time wasted traveling back and forth on all thse trains. You rtime must be worth something to you as well...Good luck and have a great time here in Chicago|`|Amzmj242aa	If you stay in downtown Chicago, take a cab.
