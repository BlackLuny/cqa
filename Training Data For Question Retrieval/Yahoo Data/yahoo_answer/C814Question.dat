20071224125354AAiTpbR	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	?Es mejor comer pescado que carne?	Uno podría todavía incluso pensar lo siguiente: los peses viven libres en el mar, por lo tanto viven una vida buena antes de ser capturados.   En realidad, el mar se está vaciando, el Mar del Norte ya contiene sólo la mitad de la cantidad de peces que solía tener. El salmón, la anguila y la trucha son procreadas en grandes tanques, como en la industria agrícola, donde se utilizan antibióticos. Muchos peces del mar sirven de alimento para estos peces.   Dado que en las cercanías de las grandes urbes la pesca es cada vez menor, y debido a que los camiones son cada vez más grandes y menos dependientes del puerto local, los pescadores tienden a navegar mucho más lejos para poder efectuar su pesca. Por ejemplo, en las costas africanas, pescadores europeos les roban la pesca a los pescadores tradicionales a través del uso de enormes redes de dragar. Y, aparte de privar a la gente de su sustento, estas redes llegan hasta el fondo del mar y destruyen completamente el área desde una perspectiva ecológica.

I already disliked pork and all red meats, and now it seems that even chicken, seafood, and any other meats have lost any appeal to me as well. I'm not sure if this means by body/mind are encouraging me to be a vegetarian or if this is just going to pass. For the past month just the thought of eating any sort of meat has made me feel sick to my stomach. Has anybody else had this happen? Does it pass?

20081025174706AAZBC7s	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	What are some ideas for an easy vegan snack to make tonight?	My roommate and I have seen very little of each other over the past month, since we're both full-time students, and she's working full-time as well.  She's a very good friend of mine, and I want to do something nice for her tonight.  She normally gets home from work way after I've gone to sleep, so I was thinking I could make her a little snack to leave out for her to find when she gets home.      However, on the weekends, one of her coworkers that she is very close to stays with us.  He's awesome and I love him to death, but he's vegan.  Since neither myself nor my roommate are vegan, I have no ideas for baked goods or snacks I could make to leave out that this vegan friend of ours could eat.      Any suggestions?  I'm looking for recipes or links to recipes - I want to do this tonight, and I don't have the time or money to go buy a cookbook or anything.  Baked goods or other kinds of desserts are ideal; I'm way better at baking than "regular" cooking, hahah.      Any ideas?

20090226130403AAo11rI	Food & Drink;Entertaining	What can i do for a party?	its my 16th soon and i dont have a clue what im going to do.   i was going to have a biggish party and invite like about 30 people, but i wouldnt know who to invite, and its not that im like a geek with no friends but its that i speak to loads of people - just not friends with them and theres different groups and stuff.   i could invite a few people round but this would be kinda boring i suppose because i have my best friend and as i said before i speak to lots of groups so nobody really speaks to each other :P   so i dont know what to do! its in april so an outside thing wouldnt be too good.   by mum says that i could take a few people to a holiday park thing for 2 nights (with her but she would stay out)   my friends have already done or planning a:   alice in wonderland party and going for a high tea   making brownies and playing twister party off of skins if you didnt know.   recording a song   gothic fairytale   candyworld (sounds bad but it was amazing)   beauty and the geek.   so i dont know, any ideas at all?

20090226130204AA3ztZ3	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	My husband is an alcoholic - Help?	Hi there      My husband is an alcoholic and its doing me head in now....I know that its an illness.  But he has been in hospital 3 times now over the last 2 years, because he has had fits because he tried to stop drinking and ended up being sick for days and brough it on.  The first 2 times he didn't admit the drinking, but on the 3rd time he did and it was really good.  He was detoxed and was doing really well, but now he has started drinking again and I am at the end of my tether and don't know what to do.      I have thought about leaving many times but I am still here.  I am so stressed that I am now ill from it all.  I cant take it anymore.  He is 34 and I am 32, we do not have any children luckily!!  The hospital referred him to Aquarius but we have not heard anything from them and he wont contact them.  Any suggestions other than to leave him??  His parents are really upset also by it all and they are ill to.   Thanks   Sue
