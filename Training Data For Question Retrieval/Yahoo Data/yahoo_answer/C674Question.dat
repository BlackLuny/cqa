20090307165642AA3lM7Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can I do in this situation?	Im dating this guy called ryan and i think hes cheating on my friend stacey because i found her underwear in the back of his car last week but stacey denies it because she told me that shes sleeping with my friend anna's boyfriend, mark, and i asked mark about this and he said he was and he tried to come on to me but i said no and he called me a lesbian which put me in an existential crisis for a while and i thought why do i like men not women so for about 2 weeks me and stacey went out but then i got back on the winning side and started going out with ryan who was going out with laetitia whos sister, alapecia was on tv this one time and all the guys wanted to get with her and either ryan or andrew, who is going out with laetita now, was the father of her baby, when he turned out chinese she gave him up for adoption and we have no idea who the father is, anyway i really think that ryan is sleeping around, plus ive been feeling really ill recently and my food has been tasting all metallic and ive been really hungry recently, am i diabetic? or is it something else?
20090307170204AACzK40	Family & Relationships;Friends	Past best friend inexplicably ignoring me?	I've been taking some time out of college this year, and my best friend at the college I attended was on spring break this past week.  Our friendship did sour a bit towards the end of last year and we had a few confrontations over the summer, but the last couple times we met up it seemed pretty clear that we had both put that behind us.  Also, he was/is by far the best friend I've ever had, and he seems to consider me to be about the same.      So, this week, I was pretty excited about him coming home for spring break (we live in the same town but our college is a few hours away). I tried to contact him a few times over the course of this week to to try to get together and he hasn't answered my calls, text, or facebook comments.        I'm now very frustrated and confused about the whole situation.  What do you take of all this?  And what should I do at this point?

He's only 16 and has extreme problems with depression, drugs, and violence.   He's never actually hurt himself before, but his psychiatrist is admitting him anyways.   It's only for a week, but he is so, so scared.   I don't know what to do for him.   Will I be able to visit him?   I'm a 17 year old girl if that helps.   Thanks to all who answer.

20090307184841AAcozRM	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm having feelings towards a friend, but I'm very shy and scared to tell her. What do you think?	That's right, another dating question. I'm 17 and in grade 12. For the longest time, I've struggled with feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. I isolated myself from people for a very long time. Last year, I decided to take a risk and I joined a club. I guess it's a good thing I did because I met this very nice and pretty girl. We have a lot of things in common. We pretty much like the same things and we have similar personalities, although she's much more social than I am. She was in grade 12 last year and came back for another semester this year. She's gone now though and I still try to keep in contact with her. She's going to university after the summer.      Something that kind of surprised me was when she opened up to me about problems she was having and has had in the past. It made me feel good that she was comfortable enough to tell me this, but it was hard for me to figure out why she was exactly. She hung out with a lot of her friends at lunch and I was there too. The nicest thing she said to me was that I was one of her close friends. I've even told her some things about myself and she has listened. She's pretty much everything I've ever wanted in a girl. She gives me hugs a lot and I give her some affection too. She told me I made this one guy jealous that had a crush on her because we were able to do this.      Basically, I think I'm in love with her. I have no idea what the future holds for us, but I want to try to get closer to her. I care so much about her and I want to do whatever it takes to make her happy. I'm going to wait a little bit until I'm comfortable, but I can't wait too long or else she'll slip away from me. I'm worried she may not return my feelings though. What do you think about this?
20090307184704AACQZK1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does this girl keep comign to my house? I wanna tell her to go away but I can't?	This girl I haven't talked to in over a year came to my house yesterday.   I stopped talking to her over a year ago because she was saying a lot of crap about me like that i was ugly and lame and how no one should be my friend so i stopped talking to her completey.       So I was getting on with my life and after track practice I came home and got a slice of pie and it was 11:30 at night and I heard the doorbell rung. she came too my door and she looked suicidal. i thought she got raped so i asked her what was wrong and she took about 2 hours of my time to tell em that she got cheated on by her 18 year old boyfriend (she's 14) with her best friend. she told me all this stuff like      -She's bisexual and shes's had sex with a girl (she wasn't a year ago but w/e)   -She thinks all black men have aids and she only dates white me (Idk why she said this,her white bf cheated on her she's black)   -And she's gonna jump this high schooler (she's in  middle school)    and a bunch of other nonsense. Annd now she thinks we are friends. she's coming to my hosue every day ad i feel kinda sorry for her but i don't want her to keep coming over here.       It's 3 part question...      (a)What can I say to her without coming off as a beeyotch?      (b)Do you think she is a bad influence?      (c)What can i do to help her,or reccommend some places for her to go if she needs help?
20090307191713AAFw5Xl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: would you think this girl is wierd?	Lets say she is an attractive girl and you saw her walking and looking at herself in a small mirror she has in her purse and then you saw her fixing her hair and checking her eye makeu... while she is walking..       would you think she is wierd? what would you assume? would you think she is trying to look good cause shes walking to see her boyfriend? where do you think she would be walking to if you saw her fixing herself up like that?       now keep in mind this girl was carring a gucci purse and wearing gucci sunglasses.

20090307193619AAoy72i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why am I over thinking everything?	I take the little things very seriously. It aggrivates me because I can't control myself and I just get upset/mad and don't know what to do.   For example:   When the person I like says, "I think", I get bombarded with tons of thoughts telling me that their lying or that they aren't sure of what they're saying. I over react and get upset with them but later realize, like now, that I need to stop over analyzing the little things but it never seems to stop.       Another thing that gets to me is when I ask a question and I want them to tell me how they feel and I get this...   1) I ask something only to get a yes or no question when clearly the question I asked needed explanation.         I sound like Im whining I'm sure but it's really been getting to me. I trust this person, but the second I hear or read those two things, I lose the trust. I don't want to tell them not to do that because that is just how they are. I'm not going to change them, I think I'm putting past things together with the present.   How do I get over it?   How do I stop over thinking?

Ok so one of my friends (who we can call sue) is going out with a guy named Zack. Now joe decided he wants to go out with Sue, and he has apparently liked Sue since the beginning of the year. He also says that he is friends with Zack and doesn't want to make him mad.      His plan was to wait until Zack and Sue break up, then ask Sue out. I told him that He should definitely NOT do that and he should get over her.       My question is, what do you think the right thing to do is, and what is a good way to get over someone?

20090307191702AAaNOG1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I take Plan B?	Alright I know what I did was dumb, I don't need to be told that. Now, with that said:      My boyfriend and I had sex last night without a condom, because we didn't have one slash decided this was at the time a fine idea.    We stopped after about 10 minutes, he didn't ***.   Now, I finished my period last Sunday, and he usually doesn't pre-***, and he didn't *** in me last night. So I'm not toooooo worried.    But still...   Basically what I'm asking is do you think I should venture off to RiteAid and get PlanB? I would have already, but what's stopping me is my bad past experiences with it (i was allergic)   So I want to know if i should just deal with the horribleness of it again to be on the safe-side, or if you think I don't really have much to worry about...      Thanks, don't judge please.

20090307190431AACfYmT	Family & Relationships;Friends	Who is right and who is wrong?	My friends and I wanted to shoot a movie.  We ended up shooting at my apartment and i kept asking them not to shoot all the stuff i have in my room and all the areas of my place but they kept doing it.  We shot for about 4.5 hours and a lot of scenes were in areas away from my house.  I was okay with those scenes but I didn't want them shooting all of my room for the entire internet to see what i have and since nearly all of the people at my school know where i live (past party) I am feeling very uncomfortable about having all of my possessions and what not displayed on the internet.  The fact is, is that they wouldn't really let me help with the video and I am also feeling used.  So I told them they cant use the footage of my room.  Now they are telling me that I can never help with any movies ever again unless i let them use the footage.  So my question is who is right and who is wrong in this situation?

20090307191316AA9sWkO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do guys like in a girl?	Just curious... I have a crush, but I always act like a jackass around him. I make jokes, I curse occasionally, I call him 'dude' and 'pal', I play around like we've been friends since we were born, and generally act super-duper laid back. But he isn't really responding, and I've already given him several "ideas" that I might just like him. For example, I told him to sit in my seat when my other friend was at a competition, and and even down right told him that I like him as a person. Clearly I'm doing something wrong. So dudes, what do you like in girls? And what am I doing wrong?      P.S. I'm not ugly, at least, in my educated opinion

20090307193223AAHShZ2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do u understand? I'm confused and I need opinions!?	So lately I've been really smothering my boyfriend because I'm having a hard time with life right now and I look mostly to him to get support. He's been really great and really nice but I think I'm starting to freak him out because he thinks I'm gonna be like this forever but I'm not. I know that most of the time its better to just talk about it with him, but I think in this case I need to figure it out myself. Basically I've been trying to stop smothering him without being to distant but I'm having a hard time figuring it out. I would just like to hear what you have to say or what you would do or anything. Thank you so much for helping!

20090307200609AAX0frm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HOW in the world do I start a conversation?	I'm really frustrated right now. There's this guy I really like and have liked for a long time, and I know he likes me too, or at least did like me. But the problem is, I only have one class with him and sit across the room from him (assigned seats) and that makes it hard to talk to him. The other problem is that I just don't know what to say to him. I'm kinda socially awkward - I just don't know how or what to say. Since I'm usually really quiet in that class I have with him and have barely talked to him before, it would probably be obvious and awkward if I was to just suddenly say something. Even if it was "What was our homework?" .....I don't know...I think the whole class thinks I'm really really shy, but I'm just quiet.       I keep telling myself to just get it over with and say something, but I'm afraid to and then it seems like it would make it worse cause I would be all awkward and not know what to say.      Any advice is appreciated greatly!      I'm in 9th grade. And please don't just say "Oh, you'll get over him." or something stupid.

His hours are long and hard, he is a restaurant manager/waiter and we have been married a year and half now... I'm getting real tired of his late night hours and I try to encourage/ask/talk to him about his future plans... he always talks about owning a home and having children, but common sense here... I tell him that is not possible as long as he is working as a waiter, and if he wants kids then he needs to find a job with regular hours because i honestly don't want to be with the kids alone every night.  i just want to encourage/motivate him to do something better career wise... and i don't know what to do... is this bad of me?  i'm really concerned about our future.. its impossible for me to think of a future as long as he works in this industry... right?  anyone else have experience with this?
20090307222846AAwqbXw	Family & Relationships;Family	What's worse honestly rape/molestation or physical abuse or are the both just as bad?	Ok so the ONLY reason why i'm asking this is cuz just yesterday i was talking with my grandma about those kinds of things cuz my dad has both been physically abusive with my mom. And has molested me in the past when i was younger now im 17 yrs old but he still lives with us (kinda a long story). Any way's then i was just curious so i asked my grandma honestly what's worse rape/molestation or physical abuse? then she say's abuse is then i tell her well isn't rape just as bad though? then she say's well in america (cuz shes born in greece she says that) ppl prolly think abuse is worse cuz if a women's married and her husband rapes her then ppl are going to think its her fault cuz she shouldn't of kept denying her husband. Then i told her what its still wrong and what if a person that isn't married gets raped how about that? she says something i didn't get, so i said do u even know what im saying when i say "rape"?cuz i was telling her it in greek. she says yeah then after i explained it to her more she finally was like yeah it is a bad thing but it kinda looked as though she was just saying that to drop it. But im just mad that she would think something like that about rape and all and how others may think it sometimes might be the women's fault for this kinda stuff or that it isn't as bad ad abuse, but i just wanna get more opinions to see what u guys think about this? be honest...

20090307201705AAN0lEo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When you know you'll love someone forever, how do you keep living your life normally?	Long story but maybe I can make it short.    Me and my boyfriend broke up [shocker huh?] and I don't know exactly what to do. We were together for 6 months and broke up 3 months ago. I can easily say he was my first love and possibly my first real boyfriend.      When it first happened I was too numb to understand he was gone. He left and I haven't heard from him since. I deleted his phone number out of anger and never really got to memorize it - didn't feal like I needed too- so now wherever he is I can't reach him. It's almost like he's dead.       There wasn't closer. His last words to me were "Don't cry for me, I'm not worth it."    I was in kind of a blur for a while. Maybe a week before I actually felt the pain. I don't really remember what happened in that week but Idc.       Now I rely too much on my friends to keep me from having time to think. By the time I get home I'm too tired to think so I usually fall asleep fast. The only time that's really bad is when I wake up in the middle of the night or I have a dream about him      I cried over him for the second time tonight and I literally had to curl up in a ball so I wouldn't fall apart. I don't want to be this way. Not after how well I've been doing but I don't know what to do...       If anyone can tell me how they handled their worst break up or tell me how to get through this it would be greatly appreciated. I don't really know where to go on this road anymore.
20090307223058AAxbIwP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have a psychological problem. My relationship is falling apart and I might have gotten myself pregnant :(?	So my boyfriend and I are on the verge of breaking up and I've been telling him for a few weeks that I want to break up, but he's been talking me out of it... I don't think he loves me though.... he doesn't say it, just tells me that he cares and needs time to work through family issue. I've been feeling neglected by him, but even though I'm telling him to break up, I have strong feelings for him      The worst thing that happened is last month I was 2.5 weeks late and I was going out of my mind, he called me once during that time. His dad is in the hospital and he couldn't deal with anymore stress :( He's been an @ss. All that time I was going crazy because I don't want a baby, but when my period started 2.5 weeks late I found myself crying... I'm 24 years old, all my friends are getting married, but I'm on the verge of being single again... I feet hopeless and so miserable. He tells me that he want to make things work but doesn't show me that he cares...      I'm alergic to latex and hormones literally make me sick and miserable, I've tried everything, the best thing for me is still the natural methods of preventing pregnancy. We talked about it and the risks, but this has worked for me for 6 years and I've never gotten pregnant. The problem is, the last time we had sex I told him that I was ok, but I miscounted the days because of being late last month and he literally asked me on the middle of us doing it. So I told him I was ok, later I realised that I was within days of my ovulation. I stared at emergency contraceptive for a few days, but I didn't take it... part of it was because I know it will make me sick for a few weeks, other thinks is that I'm afraid I will never have a baby... Now I'm so restless, I hate what I've done and I really don't think its working with my man... Its too late for Plan-B and I might get laid off any day now      I was thinking about it, and I think i have some serious psychological problem to make me act like that.... Wh?at can I do to help myself
20090307223523AA91B7a	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I need your help brides..?	OMG!! I have to book my venue 2 or 3 months before my wedding!!   My wedding is on Sept 12, 2009.. and my parents (who are paying for everything) just told me that is way too early for us to book a place..    After my fiance and I have been looking around all the area..   They think that with the way the economy is, i should wait a few months before the wedding and they're sooo sure i will find a great deal..   This has put a lot of frustration and stress on me.. because now i'm not even sure that i will get the place i want..    And there is no power on earth that will make them think otherwise..   We already reserved the church though..   My fiance and I don't have the money to reserve the venue..   My mom has explained to me that even if we don't find a better deal during the summer, we will go with what we want (she promised)   But, it has put a lot of frustration on my because of course, i want to have everything guaranteed by now!!   What do you think i should do??   Are they right??   Will i be able to find a place for the reception 2 or 3 months before my wedding??
20090307204413AAnHwM8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! what should i do if im in love with my best friend?	i think im IN love with one of my best friends. i know he has felt the same about me for a long time. it's just that i care about him too much and value our friendship too much to screw everything up by dating. and im certain if we were to date it would eventually end, making things different. he knows i love him but not that im IN love with him. so far pretending like the other person doesn't know that we love them has worked out pretty well. and really he just isn't the type of guy i want to date. I don't understand why i love someone i dont want to date. i felt this same way in the beginning of our friendship but it eventually went away. but now its back and i think it has something to do with the fact that i was recently dating another guy, which just makes me realize how much i care about him more than other guys. i guess ill just wait for it to go away again. anyone have any thoughts or advice?

I put my arm around her like half way through... she liked it im guessing since she leaned way into me etc. Everything seemed to be going pretty well, she was laughing at my jokes etc. then after the movie, we were sitting at a bench together talking... she was leaning against me again. I kissed her on the cheek and she just lay on my shoulder for a sec but no response. When saying goodbye, she didnt wait for a kiss or anything, it was just hug and goodbye (i kissed her on the forhead.... so ******* stupid) I also said i had a great time and we should do it again. She said yea cool.    Also she is pretty shy       Why did she not respond after I kissed her on the cheek?       I'm a senior in HS..

Well, he just texted me right now (7:30pm Saturday) that he is out having dinner with a friend (a male friend who I have met) and is asking if I am free later on. I feel a little mad like he takes me for granted, but on the other hand I don't want to be too picky because he has taken me to very expensive restaurants and does things no other guy has done for me. What do you think I should do? Reply? Not reply? Agree to see him or ?

Always been the type of gurl that gets what she wants, never been the one to cry or beg for a guy to stay, however,  I have been in situations that made me stronger and wiser, and I never wanted to feel hurt ever again so I made sure I kept my heart on lockdown. Lately, I have been falling into my bad habits all over again. This guy was so sweet to me in the beginning, but it was something very strange how I start having feelings for an asshole. I wanted a relationship with this great guy but he didn't want me, so I ended up with this jerk, I think I may have lost everything because of this jerk... I stopped talking to him for 3 weeks and he ended up calling me the other day and I want him back! Why am I so stupid?

20090307222852AAw8ZGA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok questions about boys?	Ok. I'm 18, turning 19 soon. When I was in junior high I had a boyfriend for 2 years, then 8 months after we broke up I dated a guy for 1 year, it's been a year since we broke up and since then I've managed to find really awful guys to date. They just don't treat me very well. My guy friends (and ex boyfriends) are always telling me how I'm the best looking girl , how I'm a 10, (I'm not trying to sound cocky I swear, I'm just trying to tell the story haha) and all this great stuff about me. I would say I'm fairly smart, I have a GPA of 3.7, I work hard, but I love to party and go out. I have a unique personality and I don't care what anyone thinks of me. I have some really close friends that I love and when I'm dating a guy I treat him like a king.   So now to my question, if these guys all think I'm so great why don't they want to step up to the plate and actually treat me proper when we're "seeing" eachother.   And 2, is it just because guys at this age really don't want a girlfriend, and would rather just have random hook ups??

20090307202234AA1vO5V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over this girl, or get her to like me?	There's this girl. Duh, bet you saw that one coming. I've been pretty loyal to a feeling that I think is greater than just liking somone for some 1 and a half years. She knows this, but she's also a very close friend, and she has made it so very clear that she will never like/love/think of me in that way. She likes this older guy who is one of my friends and he's very intelligent and kind and didn't want to upset her. She asked him if he would take her to the prom and he declined. I want to do something nice for her....but I don't know what I can do without her getting mad at me.... I've tried giving up on her many times. I've tried dating other girls, just being friends, ignoring her..... None of this has worked. What can I do that will improve the situation?

20090307202759AAS66WC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Breaking the touch barrier?	How do I do it in the best possible way? I’m seeing a guy for Easter and want to do this to give him a sign that I really like him. We are both extremely shy (he says something to me and he blushes and I’m even worse where if I just see someone I like I blush).       I was thinking of either touching his arm if we’re eating or (if we’re at his house watching a movie - hopefully), perhaps patting his knee.       Two questions:      1) What is the best way to do this without making it look choppy and robotic?      2) Do guys like this and is it a universal sign to guys that the girl really likes him? In other words, if I touch him will he finally get the picture?

20090307223719AAa0AMN	Family & Relationships;Friends	I seem to have too many different "groups" of friends....?	Well now that I'm in 9th grade most of my friends are in different classes than me or I just see some of them at lunch. And then their friends I don't know are with them so it's all a big mess. My whole social life is like crazy.       I sit with 2 sometimes even 3 different groups of friends at lunch on A days and on B days I sit with 2 different groups. All of this is with careful planning ontime haha not but I tryto split my lunch time up with my different friends at different tables all in 30 mins.       Then in my classes I have made new friiends and so there are more groups to deal with lol. In my geography pre ap class and my regular English class I don't really talk to those kids cause they just aren't my type of friend material.  (among other things). But in the other classes it's kind of crazy.       I just wish I had like maybe 2 or 3 groups of friends and not like 50 haha (exagerating of course but you get the idea).       Also I would love to have a really good friend like a bff but I don't really and it bums me out.       I need help.       Also do you think this means that these popular girls don't like me or what I'm a little confused:      I have a juicy couture purse and wallet. 2 coach purses and a wallet. Halston $50 sunglasses and nice cell phone (Moto Q) and an itouch and ugg boots and American eagle clothes and crap like that. (not to brag. ) I use my Christmas money and brithday money to buy my coach and juicy stuff and I get lots of gift cards for Christmas so it's not like I'm rich persay. But does this male people think I'm rich?      Also what does it mean when popular girls look you up and down or stare at you like they hate me??? I get the most awful stares!! LOL      Also I do my hair nice everyday. I just want to be presentable. It's not like I slave over the curling iron or straightener like some people think lol          I'm 15 btw   Anyway thanks
20090307210605AAmx8rz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Men and Women, whatcha think?	If you are going out, and you ask the opposite sex if he/she would ever cheat on you, and he/she would raise his/her voice saying NO (at the end of the relationship he/she did cheat on you) would you say that person can be abusive? Yes or No.
20090307194515AAhurJh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get my boyfriend to be better in bed without hurting his pride?	i've been with him for about three months and i'm very sexual in bed. I LOVE sex anywhere any position. but for him i KNOW he loves sex. he tells me all the time all the things he thinks about and some of them are really kinky and i want to try them too but he gets so shy in bed. He also wont go down on me anymore :( and he doesnt last that long. How do i get him to try some of these things he wants to do? i know he has it in him. I dont want to compare him to my last boyfriend who was like a god in bed. I really like this guy and i sex is important for me. I want to enjoy it too. I have tried everything and i cant orgasm while just having sex. I need him to go down on me and he wont. so basically i make him come and that's the end of it. I think he feels bad that he cant make me come but no man has. they all go down on me to do it and he wont. i just dont want to hurt his feelings. he gets real defensive if i criticize him. the worst part is that i'm 20 years old and he's 27 and he acts like he's never had sex in his life sometimes. What do i do!?
20090307221434AAv7Kxi	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm a 15year old girl and i have no relatives?	Hi everyone.   i'm 15yrs old and i have never met my relatives, like cousins, grandparents, etc.. well, i met my granddad twice once when i was like 4 years old.      I know barely anyuthing about them.. I don't even know their names. I don't understand this.. But recently it's made me very upset knowing that other people get the comfort from their grandmas and I dont.. I really wish I had relatives I can talk to. :(      I'm almost crying now.. No one knows what it's like to only have your mother, father and brother in your family.. Besides my parents don't talk to me now either.. my brother hates me... long story.      can someone explain this to me
20090307195251AAPpWDv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my mind off him?	During the day, I hardly think about him, but at night, sleep's impossible. It's been so long, and it's gotten better, but will I ever be the same as I was before?
20090307200650AA8bHRM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I talk to him, or not?	We talk on and off, but it seems like he's purposefully not talking to me lately. I kind of miss him, but should I act like I don't notice. I pretend not to like him, but I miss him like crazy (we dated for six months). Would it be weak to say hi over the internet? Or should I just keep my distance, and pretend it doesn't bother me.      He's got a girlfriend, by the way, but he flirts with everyone he meets.
20090307201649AAJC61i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HE'S ONLINE! should I talk to him?	Should I talk to him? We dated for six months, and there's deep down hard feelings, but neither of us talk much about them. Sometimes he's chatty with me, but other times (like now and the last few weeks) he's ignored me. Should I be 'strong' and act like it doesn't phase me?
20090307212223AAeLMw9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help-I think my boyfriend is an alcoholic?	Alright so I'm worried about my boyfriend because I think he might be an alcoholic. A little background information: We're both in our early twenties and in a long distance relationship (about seven hours away from each other when I'm away at school, four/five hours away when I'm at home.) So, I don't get to see him all that often (once a month or so, maybe once every two or three weeks if we're lucky.) We've been together for five months, though I've known him for well over three years.      Reasons why I think he might be an alcoholic:   -He goes out and drinks with his friends ALL the freaking time. Like, several days a week.   -Sometimes, when he doesn't go out with his friends, he'll drink by himself, alone in his house. When I've asked him about this, he says that he thinks it's fun to do household-y things like make spaghetti and clean dishes while being drunk. He also told me once that he doesn't need people to drink with if he wants to drink-he's very independently minded.   -The time I do spend with him he often wants to pick up alcohol each night. Now, while I do like to drink and go out and party sometimes, I definitely don't like to do it all the time, and I don't think I have the physical stamina to do it as often as he does.   -He really doesn't have a lot of control over how much he drinks, and he will often drink to the point where he doesn't remember half the night. He doesn't do this on purpose, but he doesn't seem to have any boundaries and doesn't seem to be able to stop himself.   -I also don't like him most of the time when he drinks, especially when he gets extremely drunk...he does stupid things, and sometimes hateful things. (Stupid such as kicking a trash can into the middle of a  New York City street near where I live, just because he can. Hateful because he's said some very mean things to me while drunk that he's had no recollection of whatsoever the next morning. He's never physically hurt me, of course.)      He knows that I have a problem with his drinking, but like I said, he's extremely independent and immediately rebels whenever he feels like anyone's trying to change him and/or tell him what to do or how to lead his life. He says it makes him feel like I'm his mother when I try to talk to him about this stuff, and it turns him off.      We've talked about it, and he's gone through periods where he hasn't drank but he always goes back to it. He knows I think he has alcoholic tendencies and that I don't like it. I think some of it might be because he's going through a difficult time in his life-he's unemployed,  can't find work, and is trying to find a job that will enable to him to finish college. His mom is being really hard on him about it, and I wonder if he's relieving stress or fear and is trying to escape a little bit.       It just kills me cause I care about him a lot and he is like legitimately full on in love with me (I'm almost positive he is, and I'm not being narcissistic), and he is SO good...he has so many aspirations and so much he wants to do, and it breaks my heart that he spends what little money he has (and owes me!) on alcohol because he is SO much better than that. I know, however, that if his drinking continues to this extent without him showing any real signs of change, I will need to break up with him, no matter how much it breaks my heart to do so. Please...what do you think? Is he an alcoholic? What should I do? We're trying to plan a visit for this coming week, if that means anything. And sorry, I know this is a book...

In my opinion he's funny and outgoing and great. But in others opinions he's an obnoxious weirdo.  Everyone knows that he is really attractive, but the still think negative things about him. I know that one of my friends likes him also, she's gonna get someone to tell him she likes him.  (she thinks anyone will like her) And I'm kind of scared he will start to like her and not me!

When I turned back to look at him he was still smiling at me which that's really weird.   Later he turned to and said "I Play The Piano" i nodded my head and smiled.

20090307211531AAZ0hMm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with a love letter PLEASE?	I'm 16 years old and i fell in love with my best friend. I'm writing her a letter to tell her how a feel. some of it you'd need to know our entire situation to understand. I just want to know what you think and how I can improve it. By the way, I posted the same question a few months ago, but I never went through with it. I definitely will this time.      Dear *******,      I've known you forever,   And of course,   I've always loved you...      Like a sister,   And as a friend...      However in the past few months,   My feelings have changed...      We've been spending a lot of time together lately,   And something’s happened,   Deep inside me,   I find I've fallen for you…      I value our friendship greatly,   And I don't want anything to come between us,   But I cannot hide these feelings any longer...      I may not speak with an accent,   And I may not be perfect,   But I'm me,   And I really like you,   I hope that’s enough...      Love *******

20090307205949AAWiqnj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help with this shy girl 10 easy points?	im saying everything without changing anything, coz im really confused of the situation.      so this girl and i usually see each other for 5 mins a week just when we walk from our lockers to the caf or b4 going home, we dont really see each other that long and not everyday. at first i thought she liked me too and so evn though im really shy i tried to be closer to her. i talked to her everytime i had the chance, but the thing is she never starts the conversations with me, so i always have to go to her to talk to her. and so i knew she was at the library during break with her bestfriend. so i said one time if i could go with them. were both really shy and so when i got to the library we didnt really have a steady flow of conversation( also because we were both trying to do our homework) but we did talk, had a few laughs but it wasnt really that great as i thought it would be, me hanging out with her wasnt really a fail but it kinda is. then after that i see her after school and walked her to the exit, but this time we didnt evn talk, it was awkward i just said hi then walked with her while b4 we usually talk. then today, i didnt go to the library anymore i saw her at the cafeteria then went to the lobrary and i just decided not to go with her. and when i saw her after school today, i said hi as ususal, but she didnt walk with me anymore she just walked away :( i dont know whats happening, we were close b4 i went to the library she talks alot to me when i go to her, but then this time she just left help!!!
20090307222834AAIDNoG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me?	I bought this girl a rose for valentines day in school. She said "thanks" and asked me why I gave her one with a smile on her face. She asked me online and I told her I liked her and thought she was the prettiest girl in school. She didn't believe me and said "lol" a few times throughout the online conversation because she thought I thought she was mean, so I gave her proof that two of my friends know that I like her. After math class, which is the only class I have her, she walked out the classroom first and I was behind, she looked back which she rarely does. My friend told me she asked him privately after math class if i liked her to confirm probably, and my friend said yes. So does she like me or at least is interested? Does asking her out (I'm gonna say hanging out) increase my chances of going out with her than asking online?

20090307201955AAJYSIT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do i get him to notice me?	i work next to this guy and i have for about 8 months now at least. we have been pretty good friends. a month ago we went out on a date, we had a pretty good time, kissed several times. well a few days after that i said something that sounded like i was rushing things or something when that was totally not my intention. since then things have been different we don't talk outside that much like we used to. the last couple weeks i thought i was getting some signals that he was warming back up, but hes hard to figure out. i haven't seen or talked to him since last sunday and im wondering if he notices it at all. my friend keeps trying to tell me he still likes me but i don't know. what are some things i can do to make him notice me or something? get his attention? another friend of mine tells me to be vague. me and this guy are friends on facebook and i kinda thought that putting up a picture of me and a guy-friend might get his attention but that might be a little juvenile. ideas?

20090307221431AA5Js8p	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i let them get away with this?	im at high school year eight and i was friends with this girl who went to my primary school. She is in year seven. I started having a clue she started to not like me. She started to think she was all cool and stuff. I found out from this girl, who is her close friend that she wrote a book, about all her friends and people she knows and put them into catagories: like b...i...t...c...h...e....s, sl...uts, sook, no it alls and all those mean catagories. I have not done anything mean to her and she put me in the bitc.....h section. I know im not one, because im too quiet and i just know. She put all her so called "friends" in each of those mean catagories. She put my other friend who is the nicest person ever and she is smart in the no it all section. I know this is true because she picked on a girl who was overweight and wrote a whole book on how much she hates her. I don't want her to get away with this and im not sure what to do. should she get in trouble for this?
20090307204153AAqrEuA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I deal with my relentless ex?	My ex gf wont stop texting.  We broke up over 3 months ago.  We have hooked up once since but she started seeing another guy and is now dating that person.  She still continues to text me though.  Telling me she misses me and is afraid of losing me completely and how she cant live without me in her life.  But I can't have her in my life anymore.  The relationship has taken a huge toll on me and I'm still very emotionally scarred from it.  She says she has all these feeling for me but she is with this other guy who she claims to be happy with.  I really don't get it and its making it hard on me.  I feel like I'm the one caught in the middle and i get nothing but pain from the whole situation.  I told her to leave me alone and let me be, to just let me go.  But she won't.  It still goes on.  I can't move on myself if this keeps going on like this.  How do I move on from this situation myself and how do I get her to let me be?  I just can't do it anymore.

20090307195545AAVfK0z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Intresting Situation I Need Help With?	When she had a bf we'd talk alot but at the beginning of class shrled keep to herself and do her work. Now she's single and nstead of doing her work nonstop talks to me. She changed the banner of my phone to her name and gets mad I try to change it. I changed her banner to my name a couple of days ago and it's still there. But today she kinda of acted strange. She just listented to her ipod and ignoered everyone. I tried to talk to her, and she smiled a little at te beginning of class, but as the class went on she seemed annoyed and wouldnt even looked at me, so I left her alone. Is she mad at me for something? Does she like me?         Now, I know it may sound like she likes me but I'm really not sure. She doesnt flirt that much, and I'm usually the one starting up conversations. But I've seen her with other guys and she doesnt really flirt with them either. She's extremely hard to read, and seems like she wants the guy to make all the first steps.      But, on the next day, it was our most interactive day ever. We never stopped talking/flirting the whole period, and she made her first obvious signs that she liked me, but I'm still uinsure. So what do you think? Does she like me?

20090307222234AAL6mDx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is my husband so controlling?	My husband and I have been together for 3 years now and married for 7 months. During that time we had a beautiful child together...But one problem, he's gone from bad to worse with his personality. He is always negative, painfully shy, very boring and dull, un ambitious and seems to regulate where I go and what im doing. When I first met him he was a heavy addict but a person full of life and dreams....now his addictions are mostly gone thx 2 me. He says i cant go anywhere cuz i dont have gas money(im a stay at home mom) or some other excuse about the car not working. He always suspects me of cheating when I'm not, I despise cheating but I often thought about it as a way out so that he can finally divource m becuz he just DOESNT GIVE UP! Whenever he's not happy with something I do, he blames me all for it, yells at me, throws a fit and grabs me really hard. No punching slapping, or kicking. just grabs me really hard or somethings throws me on the bed and yells. It scares our son and I repeatedly beg him not to display that behavior in front of our baby but he says he cant control himself and i caused him to behave that way. no matter what I do or say to he always forgives and wont let me go. I nearly cheated on him a couple of times but he still wouldnt let me go. I dont have anywhere else to stay and would be severly struggling with my child that he's incapable of taking care of, if I left my husband. Theres no one with any available space for me and my one year old. I fel so trapped! What should I do?      He blames his controlling behavior from the lost of his bro in a car acident, his cheating ex b4 me, and being adopted in a houseful of kids. he would befriend the kids and thn they would leave soon after.
20090307200548AA96TEA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I think about this guy?	This guy and I have known eachother for almost four years now, and I really liked him at one point in time, but he would always ignore me when we were in school. After 2 years of being friends with him, we had sex, but we never dated because he didnt want a relationship. Im not stupid I know he was just using me. About 3 months ago we got in a big argument, he eas putting me down saying ****** up things that werent even true trying to make me feel like ****. Just yesterday he texted me and asked if he could get somethin I had of his back, and he asked how I was doing. Why the hell is he doing that? Why does he care if he thinks all this bad **** about me?
20090307200726AAWgQqc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(GUYS answer) What should I say to a guy?	Okay, I'm a preteen soon to be teenager and I have a crush on this guy. What should I say to make small conversation. We're in the same class. He's a pretty nice guy, kinda popular, but he's not like arrogant or a jerk about it or anything. I need some pointers. Should I talk about school, ask him a question,(if so could you suggest what kinda casual questions to ask a guy) I'm a girl and I've never been in a relationship and it's very new to it so I'm basically clueless.  Could you please help me out?
20090307204822AAsSCpS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does he always pat my head?	It makes me feel like I'm his little sister. He hugs other girls, he flirts with them, and he treats them like girls. With me, he pats my head, he tells me, "your so silly. you have to learn more about guys." and treats me like his little sister? And the thing is all of my friends and his friends knows that I like him...and so does he. Why does he have to treat me like that though. I like it when he gives me some attention, but I really prefer if he doesn't do it that way. I rather him just be a normal friend then to treat me like his little sister, because it makes me feel gross to like him, since you know...brother-sister = incest

20090307195504AARArYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl interested in me?	I know this girl for about a month now and we talk almost every day after class on our way to our dorms. And we have got together a couple times outside of class to study and get lunch afterwards.       Last week I asked her out on a date. And at first she seemed somewhat taken aback and said yes but when I asked if she was sure she said that she "kind" of have someone and that it is "really weird" between them. When I asked her to clarify she wouldn't elaborate on the "someone" and just said her life was really complicated and she isn't even sure whats going on. So I got the "not right now" but "I'll keep thinking about it." response.      I dropped it and and avoided the topic but we continued to talk everyday after class as if I haven't asked her out.       But during the last few days she seemed to be a bit different when we talk. She would laugh a lot more and smile at me when we bid goodbye and give me really random details about her plans for this weekend(busy) and started telling me things about her family.       I'm just really confused if she likes me back or not. She is really shy and innocent so idk if her initial response was just her way of outright rejecting me. Should I ask her to clarify her feelings again or just keep talking to her and perhaps move on?

20090307211629AA4HhOs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to reject a guy that is really nice, sweet, smart, and funny?	He just asked me to be his girlfriend and go to prom with him yesterday and I really don't think I want to go with him. He's an amazing guy and I know that I will feel completely bad if i hurt him. It's just that yesterday as well, I just went through a break-up (this week hasn't been a good week for our relationship)...and it's really too much for me to agree with someone else right now. I told him "no" yesterday, but he seems really upset and he's refusing to befriend me today. His friend says that he's embarrassed. What can I do to make him feel better without saying yes? I know that even if he is to ask me at the right time, right place, I still wouldn't want to be with him either though, because I don't feel that way about him...at all. I feel really bad though. BUT the thing is, I know that there are tons and many girls out there who would love to be with him. Any advice?

20090307211801AA2Yx67	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't be friends with my ex's ?	Ok so i'm usually really good about picking the guys i date i end up becoming like their best friend. Like my first boyfriend i told him "i can't date you but i can be your friend ok? you're just too not my type i'm sorry" and then we ended up being friends and what happened was I got him hooked up with one of my friends and they've been dating for like a year and we only dated like a month.                So my problem now is well i usually hook my ex's with my friends or family member cause i know they're good boyfriends. So recently my break up with my boyfriend hes been ok with me coming to his house to like do study dates and w/e and i asked him if he was ready for someone new yet. we've been pretty good friends. but yesterday i went over to his house and i talked to him about this girl i've been talking to in class one of my friends and i showed his picture to her and she liked him and i told her i could get him to date her. So when i went over to his house to talk to him about the girl in my class. we talked laughed a little then he kissed me. When he kissed me i stood up and left.  i think i said somthing like "ummm... i'll talk to you later about her then ok?" and i left     What should i do? And now i think i might still like him (like i said i pick pretty good boyfriends)

20090307202722AAdLHjP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Who should I pick? Should I pick?	Okay, so when I started middle school I started going out with this girl named Danielle. We really liked each other but I broke up with her over the summer because we were really different. (she was shy and quiet and I was popular and outgoing) Well, fast forward to 7th grade. We started going out again and it was great. We really had more chemistry this time and I loved her. Over the summer, we broke up again because I was supposed to be going to a different school. I continued to attend the same school with her, still having feelings for her. I watched her go out with guy after guy during this year. (8th grade) So, I recently confessed to her that I still liked her and she said that she still liked me. But for some reason, she wasn't saying no to me and she wasn't saying yes. I realised that she has changed dramtically, now popular and prettier. She acts a lot different and is now more "experienced". So, we continue to flirt during school. Then, we both go to a birthday party for my friend. We continue to flirt but she reveals that she likes someone else. So she leaves the party and we continue to chill at his neighborhood. When, walking around, we run into his neighbor. So, I turn on the charm and we flirt alot. (she is homeschooled and in 9th grade) I really start to like her and it turns out she likes me too.  But I find out that my best friend (birthday boy) and his neighbor also likes her. I don't know what to do. I really like them both. But one has changed from the person I used to love and one is homeschooled so I wouldn't see her often.

First of all I am a 20 yr old male who has had many Girl friends although I remain a virgin by choice. Why is it that I cannot seem to find anyone like me.....someone who has had the opportunity but decided against it. Who chose a different path for a different reason. Someone who does not believe they should have sex for the simple matter that they do not want to mix Love and feeling.

20090307200534AAnmSfG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I WANT HIM IN MY LIFE, WHAT CAN I DO?	This guy and I have been great, practically best friends since sixth grade along with a great connection and physical attraction. We never pursued everything. I started dating someone at 16 and he told me he would wait for me...well we lost touch and we are both now 21. Two years ago we started talking again, met up, while my boyfriend and I were broken up and had a great night. He called and called and called after that night. I finally told him my boyfriend and I got back together. We lost touch again. A month ago I called him and he told me he had a girlfriend and she screens his calls so I cant talk to him. He is different because of her. She isnt good for him (I know her), and deep down I have and will always have feelings for him. We got together again once more and now I cant get a hold of him after he said he would call. I'm guessing they are back together, he wont even tell me if they are? I dont know what to do...I'm guessing nothing until he realizes what a phsycho she is and how much she controls him and screens his calls. I am only trying to be a friend to him, nothing more...although if it were to be something more than that, it wouldnt hurt :) He wont contact me like he did 2 years ago...it really hurts. He is different.but anyways any advice?

I've never had the courage or the opportunity to talk to him. He always sits in the row in front of me and he's all buddy buddy with my old lab partner (but I don't really talk to him).

20090307202901AAyub2x	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long Distance Relationship... Romance Tips Anyone?	My boyfriend and I are very much in love. He's a family friend and we got together last summer up in Montana. James is 3 years older than I. People say I'm way too young for him because he is 19 and I am 16, but our relationship is very serious and it will most definitely work out.       I know there are going to be many skeptics reading this and probably want to say things like: "LDR's don't work", "He only wants sex", "He's probably cheating on you"...      I've heard them all, but what we have for each other is nothing but unconditional love and that's why we've made this LDR work for the last year. He is moving down to California, where I live, in only a matter of months...      My question though is what can we do to bring more romance to one another?      We have phone sex, but most the time it isn't satisfying enough (since we can't do the real thing). If there's any tips on how to make our late night conversations any better, I would really appreciate it.      Please no hate-mail, or bashing, or anything of that sort. I would like only positive tips, no bad opinions.

20090307205705AAf95Vv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im asking for your opinion...help please =]?	i'm sorry for the long message, but it would really be cool if someone would try and help me out      ok, i live in a small town and at school i never know what to believe because what is being said a lot of times isnt true or actually right.  im 15, almost 16 in about a week, and theres this girl that i dated last year (also 15) and we broke up after about 4 months because things seemed awkward and now we're really good friends still [which im very happy that we're still good friends at least].  i think it was because i asked her out when school was close to getting out and we didnt get to see each other during the summer but only a few times and then when school started again we were together almost the whole day all of the sudden.  i still liked her and had feelings for her after and then i asked her out later on and said that i was a fool and a jackass when we dated and i changed now and im not the same as i was before -in a good way- and im asking for another chance. but she said that shes not looking for a boyfriend right now but prolly in the future...prolly in high school still....not like 'future' future...thats prolly confusing so you can ignore the future thing.  then not long after that, one of my best friends sucks up to her like he does with every other girl that he will all-of-the-sudden like and she goes out with him...so much for what she said about not looking for a boyfriend huh.  then he was sayin that i was mad at him because hes dating her and i still like her but i really wasnt. now we're not friends and i hate him because hes the biggest dumbass i've ever met...dont need to explain about him.  then they broke up not that much long after they started dating and a bunch of my friends were saying it was because of me, because he asked her if she likes me and she said "well...idk...maybe...yeah..." and he overreacted, broke up with her, and was a complete *** hole to her.  so i talked to her about this just the other day (about 2 weeks after they broke up) and when i started talkin to her i told her i heard that she maybe liked me again, she says "well he thought that i liked you, but i really didnt and he overreacted" and somethin else.  i wanted to tell her how i feel and other things but i figured well that would be pointless, so i just asked her out so i could leave.   i asked if she would go out with me again and she said the same thing as she did last time "i'm not lookin for a boyfriend right now but maybe like in the future and stuff".  i think shes giving a stupid excuse/stupid excuses and not cutting the bull **** and actually telling me why. this kinda pisses me off.  we have almost every class together and we talk and text all the time and flirt a little everyday. i know, your thinkin that i should just let it all go and move on and stuff like that and its just high school...but she makes me feel like no one else does and she is an amazing person and i dont wanna let it go. i actually look forward to going to school just so i can see her and stuff...and its surprising for me to look forward to go to school lol.  and no, it is not an obsession. i'm not like that..      can someone please help me with this...im not gonna ask my friends this time because i dont know who to listen to right now with hearing different things

I would say we know each other very well. I have started to have feelings for him, but I don't think he feels the same way. We always talk and text, except the thing is, I am always the one to start these conversations usually. I have asked him to hangout twice and each time he could not. We did hangout once though but with other people. I just do not understand, sometimes he acts like he likes me and stuff, but if he did why does he never try and make plans with me? Like you would think if a guy likes you, he would make time for you right? Or am I just over thinking these things? Should I just remain friends with him and just see what happens?
20090307200658AAUR74k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best friend gets all the attention?	This one kid I used to like for a year left for another country for a few months. He gave me the biggest heartbreak by asking my best friend out. He also mentioned he doesn't like me back and never will. But he never really knew the real me. He's back and I see him tomorrow. I'm afraid him and my best friend are just going to become even closer, even though they broke up and I am just going to feel like a third wheel. She always gets attention from all the guys and no one ever pays attention to me. I even thought I could have just this one guy, but then he ended up asking out my best friend. How do I get more attention from these guys instead of my friend, and how do I win back that certain guy? I still think I like him..   I don't think I'm ugly, in fact I think both my best friend and I look alike. I just don't understand why they all love her, and ignore me.

20090307203020AAsY3i5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When should the girl offer to pay?	I have heard there is a dating rule that when a girl asks a guy out, she should pay. I have also heard that it is always considerate to offer to pay, regardless of who did the asking (that way, you don't like your demanding he pays).      However, when I have offered to pay, the guy has reacted really awkwardly/slightly flustered.      So, what do you think I should do with the following scenario:      I asked guy to lunch. Started out awkwardly (especially when it came to order, since I wasn't quite sure if it was a date [or just a casual lunch], so we went dutch). However, it ended well, and he told me that he wanted to do lunch again. After waiting to see if he would call, I called him to do lunch and he seemed enthusiastic.      So on the next lunch: Do I offer to pay? Do I try to go dutch? Expecting him to pay seems a little inappropriate, but should I give him a chance to? Why are guys so awkward when the girl offers to pay?

20090307211323AArlWqc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i just do it ?	ok, so i know this is a really long story, but im really confused and i have no idea what to do.   recently i discovered that i had a huge thing for my best friend  (erik) of over three years. we both talked about this and he told me that he doesnt see me as more than a sister, which at first hurt really bad, but ive come to accept it and i really just dont want to loose him in my life. however, a few days ago an old hookup of mine (mike) contacted me and wants to hang out again. but, i know that if we "hang out" i'll just end up hooking up with him. (no strings attached) which i kinda want to, because i feel like i need to release my emotions and sexual tension with erik because they've been building up for quite some time. but the bad thing about this is erik HATES mike and has told me that he doesnt want me seeing him because he knows that he's just gonna have sex with me and then hurt me. and i really dont want to disappoint him since he's my best friend, but i really want to just do something physical just to get it out of my system; maybe as some sort of closure or something... so should i just hook up with mike and not tell erik ? or should i just not do it at all ?

20090307213320AAHfMY2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I ask a girl out?	Okay, here's what happened.  I like this girl in school, but I don't know her very well, so I asked a friend of mine for help who happened to be friends with the girl.  Apparently the girl already knew that I like her, because of some kind of "vibe" she gets whenever I talk to her (I chat with her on Facebook once in a while).  Anyways, she told my friend that I liked her, and my friend basically confessed to everything I told her.  So, anyways, the girl told my friend that she's puzzled why I liked her, because I don't know her very well.  Also, she told my friend that she might've liked me back if I just approached her directly instead of asking my friend for help.  She said that she doesn't like shy boys.        Anyways, I don't know what to do.  I think I should just give it one last shot.  I'm thinking about asking her out up front, but I dunno if it is too late and that it's not gonna help.  All that would happen is massive humiliation (currently, nobody except those mentioned knows about this) because then everyone would know.        So the question is, should I take this last shot and ask her out?  Or am I screwed and just not bother and save whatever's left of my dignity?  If I'm not screwed, how will I ask her out?  If I still fail, what should I do after that?

She asked me if i had mine still and I said I thought so then she said, "well I might need it cus i cant find mine" I found this slightly presumptuous but didn't make too big of a deal about it.

She then said "K can we pick up the discount card?" I don't understand her reasoning behind this, its my card for one and secondly why would I give it to her when I'm not going to be there and she doesn't even want me there? I told her I wasn't home and she didn't reply then a few hours later she asked "k can we come pick up the card in ten?" by this point I was fed up and didn't respond, a few phone calls followed but I didn't answer.

20090505182759AA8dLEj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Being a Pharmacy Specialist?	I know I posted this in marriage and divorce but the category it belongs nobody ever answers. I have to say this as to what its like as a pharmacy specialist for walgreens. It will make you hate old people and the public in general. All you get is a bunch of old b*stards (some of them being incredibly ignorant and racist) who have nothing better to do with the rest of their life than to wake up each day and bug the heck out of doctor's, nurses, and pharmacist for NO d*mn reason. All because they ASSUME or THINK something is wrong with them and they need a prescription or refill. The rest of the public is no better by the way, thinking that everybody and the world itself is suppose to stop when they need something, NOT realizing there are others ahead of them. Being a fiend for a prescription is not necessary. Thinking that you are going to die or have problems if you dont take the d*mn pill or whatever right then and there is just being melodramatic. Man up and quit being a little b*tch about it. Then people get even more crabby when they find out their insurance doesnt cover something. This is AMERICA, we have the worst healthcare in the world. What may have been covered last month may not be covered this month. Keep up with your own d*mn insurance so you wont blame us like we're the problem. The same goes for your refills too, so quit telling us you have refills when you DONT. Also know EXACTLY when its time to refill again and quit trying to refill everything EARLY (especially you a**holes that go out of town on vacation every day). Old people and the regular public are not all the blame, its the young as well. Especially young women. You young chicks go out and party, be stupid, and f*ck until your accepted as the most popular (and sl*ttiest wh*re) in school or college, THEN expect to get the Plan B morning after pill the next day thinking it will wash all your wh*rishness away. I dont think so. Its no telling how many times they have done this, so Im sure they just do it because they love sex and screwing guys at a bar or club and catch as many STD's as possible. It must be a contest, because every pharmacy in america is selling herpes medication by the boatload. The streets are making more money off that than they are cocaine. If its not that then its the birth control. Yes some women have it to control their periods or whatever but you can tell the one's that want it so they can screw that night without a condom (or in case the condom break). Because they be fiends demanding that sh*t, with that lame excuse as to "they need to start it today". How the h*ll would your body know a monday from a freakin wednesday? Birth control does not protect or permit you to screw without a condom nor does it protect from an std. How many commercials have you seen that preached that same message. They probably was screwing through them. Yet they wonder why they have all these std's. Last, let me just say to everybody who is an a**hole about the walgreens call center. This includes, patients, nurses, doctors, whoever. They have a call center now , it helps the pharmacist with the patients who are actually in the store instead of being flooded with all the dumb a** phone calls from the public that are about NOTHING important. They take thousands of calls each day. With all those calls, the pharmacist would never get all your crap done for you so be grateful. Yet nothing is ever fast enough for the public. For all those who want to complain about the new system and say how crappy it is, screw you. Its not going anywhere so get use to it. Instead of being so SELFISH did you ever think about how many JOBS this has given people during this recession? No you havent because all the public cares about is itself. Walgreens or ANY other pharmacy for that matter (CVS, Rite Aid, Walmart, Target, etc) or its employees does not give a d*mn about your opinions or complaints so stop it, we're already stressed enough. The fact is nobody is going anywhere when they threaten to leave because each pharmacy has millions of customers and one a**hole leaving wont hurt any company. You still need prescriptions filled somewhere so the business is needed. I know Im going to get plenty of hate mail with this but I just had to say this, Im sure this is what any nurse, pharmacist, pharmacist technician or specialist or doctor has been wanting to say for years.

20090307231001AA6lWQs	Family & Relationships;Friends	Drunkenness and affection?	i have a friend who i would like to be more affectionate with but i only seem to do it when i'm drunk. When i'm sober i don't even seem to hug him much, but when i'm drunk i'm all over him, nothing really sleezy, kind of cuddly.      i'm not sure which state is the problem, too much touchy-feely when drunk or not enough when sober, i would like more affection but i'm not sure if it's appropriate, but i'm relatively sure there's something a bit unhealthy about only when drunk.      i think i may even get drunk for it, but i can't quite see what my motioves are. Maybe i'm a bit shy round him sober and need a bit of dutch courage to express myself, or maybe i want a nice excuse to get a little closer than is socially acceptable?      Whatever my motive i've gotta stop it, i have a terrible hangover today.      background: We've known each other about 3 years. I do have somewhat romantic feelings for him, but it can't go anywhere. We both have partners, i have a boyfriend i've been with for 4 years and have just moved in with, he has only just started seeing his girlfriend but they were friends before then and it seems quite serious already.

20090307223948AApVDtb	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Starting to get depressed?	i'm starting to get really depressed about the whole dating thing. i just ended my first real "serious" (it was only one month, but it had really been going on longer than that) relationship a couple months ago, and i'm beginning to doubt that i can have another relationship at all. i'm not the type of guy girls tend to be interested in - i'm the "nice" guy, and i tend to be pretty quiet and reserved until you get to know me.      i pretty much never even talk to girls. i just tried to start up a conversation on facebook with a girl i know recently, and that was a miserable failure. i never really get the opportunity to talk to girls (i'm in college right now), and i don't really know what to do about that.      I feel like i'm pretty much just gonna be alone from now on, and that really sucks. the one thing i want the most right now is to have a girl to be with and to be able to talk to, and it seems like i just can't have it. that's all it would take for me to be happy, but right now, i'm kind of miserable.

She used to be my lover when I was 20 years old. We are now both 50. I gave her my email address, and she wrote me. But I have   been unable to write back. Each time I try, I get butterflies.    After about 4 days of trying to write, I wrote her a short email and   said, I have been thinking about you, but I haven't been able to write you because of butterflies. How will this be accepted? To me,    it is a sign of weakness, a potential turn off.  She was so excited to hear from me.

20090307232036AAqwhq2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to make of this, ex gf.?	I have this ex gf that broke up with me, and immediately started seeing some other guy.  I stayed in contact with her for awhile, but it seemed like the new guy was a complete loser.      Anyway I met her on a online dating site, I log on tonight and see she created a new profile and she's online.  She pops up on Yahoo IM, and starts chatting with me.      Right away she tells me everything is going great with her new bf, she's getting married in May, etc. etc. etc.      I go back to the dating site, and the new profile of her is gone now. lol      Don't care, but found it odd that she'd sign up on a dating site.  Talk to me when she hadn't in probably a month.  Then delete the profile, all in like an hour or so.      When I was with her, I sometimes wondered if she's crazy, this really seems to come across as crazy to me.        What do you guys think?

20061111102139AApYoym	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just friends?	A guy I like very much.  I am somewhat older than him so in the beginning I tried to keep a distance from him but he didn't give up and we became very close and he wanted me to meet his buddies, family and told me once all he had wanted to do that day was be with me.  But he had an out of town weekend gf so it was constant mixed signals from him & I tried to keep a distance. I  e-mailed and told him I was confused about how things were between us & said some things to give him the idea that I liked him as more than a friend & he answered back that he just wants to be friends. But he continues to act in a confusing way and say things that make me think he does like me as more than a friend.  I don't know if he still has the gf---we don't talk about that.  So I'm wondering---has anyone out there ever told someone they just wanted to be friends when really you did like the other person?  Were you confused or scared and is that why?  Is it the age difference that's the problem in my case

My daughter is 14, ive tried to be the best mum in the world,i know shes at an age where friends seem to be the only people that matter( I was her age once too) But lately things are troubling her at school, and shes confused about this on then  off again BF she has, I only ever try to be nice to her when shes like this... and she does talk to me about stuff when she is ready, but lately she just keeps treating me like Crap, in the past Ive taken her mobile or ipod or banned her from the net and she just abuses me, she always feels bad after..I sometimes try and talk sternly to her and end up yelling because she is so horrible to me .. other times i just keep my cool  like today.. but  today  I just couldnt take anymore, so i sent her off to my mothers with no ph, no ipod no internet, just so she can have some time away from it all and have a good think about how her behaviour is affecting me and everyone and herself. She has been cutting her self a little as well.. she is such a great kid,and I do tell her this often, have i done the wrong thing sending her to her grandmothers. PS shes only 5 minute drive away..I felt if i didnt do this i was going to SNAP sometimes i think ive let her get away with too much, just to keep the peace. help.. is anyone else going through the same thing?
20090308000317AA8mVeP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do i handle this friends with benefits situation?	i dated a guy for two months, and then broke it off because he does not want any relationship and he's moving out of the city soon.  well, i decided we could keep it friends with benefits style.  i'm ok with that, i don't think we had a huge connection, but the sex was good.   i like him, and we hang out and then..ya know.     but i'm not sure the etiquette on this.        can we hang out normally, like go to a bar with friends and not have sex.     or does every time i'm with him mean we have sex?     how often should i call him to have a rendezvous-as in how much is too much?      this is very confusing because i don't know 'the rules'         and anyone who's going to say something judgmental about sleeping with someone needs to grow up and not answer this question!!!  that is not constructive for me.
20090307230955AATN0he	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls please answer!....Need your opinion!?	I've liked this girl for some time and my friends said it was time for me to ask her out. So it was an assembly n i was next to her. Her and I were havin a good time just messin around, you know flirting. Then my boy was like i'll help you so he told me tp pass some fake *** rumor about him and I told her she laughed n passed it on. When I got the balls to do it I got her attention and whispered in her ear, "There's another rumor, its supposedly i'm going to ask you out.....so I was wonderin if you do". She was surprised, at first she didn't believe me cause i joke around alot but I told her I was serious, n she just said idk with a big smile on her face while blushing. This is where you all come in, did I take the right approach in askin her out the way I did? Should I have done it another way? If so, then how? N last, was it because I joke around alot that she wont go out with me?

IM scared cause they might tell secrets of me cuz Angelica and Carlotta still talk to eachother      Carlotta and Angela are at the same class as me      Angelica isn't , were all year 5's      Im not feeling safe on telling them secrets like whjos my secret crush etc.      !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Angelica still talks to CARLOTTA      if their not real friends/friend what should i do:????      I also HAD another 3 friends ( one my cousin and the 2 others are just friends ) but they were leaving ME OUT ALWAYS so i really wanted to cry and i did and my teacher said wahts wrong ( Told her the whole thing ) now i broke up with them ( the other reason was my cousin was being a major showoff ) I always waited for my other friend louise if she was the slowest one to eat when my cousin and another friend put away their lunch box.

So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

20090307225911AAufcIW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Blaming husband and his family for past mistakes?	My wife was blaming for some mistakes like they didn't actively participate in our marriage as our's was intercaste marriage. Since they wanted my happiness they agreed for marriage. I accept that it is my parents mistake and my mom was angry since my wife's parents didn't greet them well. Later they realised there mistakes and started to respect her parents.Even my mom helped her sisters for their education by giving books and other materials. I was very happy since my mom and her parents were joining together. My mom accepted my wife as her daughter and was treating in the same way as she will show to my sister. mom helped my wife whenever she asked for help. But my wife has grudge. She was scolding me and my mom for our past mistakes. We were living in separate house and my mom and sis never poked their nose into our marital life. on the day when she left my home, she scolded my mom for not bringing me up correctly. My mom thought me how to respect woman, not to be dependant on others in any way. In our married life, we both did mistakes like we both were lazy, she has desire for shopping, I had desire for reading books. There was communication problem as I know. I accepted my mistakes, but she was never ready to accept her mistakes and she refused to work on our marriage.

20090307234554AAUNnXz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask him to the dance?	My school is having a semi formal dance soon. I was considering going, but I don't want to go alone unless I can find a group of friends to go with. There's this boy in my class that I really like, but I am too afraid to make a move. He is the complete oposite of me...He's outgoing and funny, whereas I am shy and reserved. There's another guy in my class that is just like me...He's shy too. I don't think he has a gf, so I was thinking of asking him if he wants to go with me. I mean, you live once, and the worst he could do is say no, right?
20060825155505AAmmMHO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cómo sabes si la ex dejo de ser importante en la vida de tu novio? y que se puede consider como infidelidad?	Hace unos cuantos minutos descubri que mi novio sigue llamandole por telefono a la ex, quien esta en Ecuador cuando nosotros estamos en Estados Unidos. Esto ya ha pasado antes y sé que antes se decian palabras de amor (no sé ahora). Cada vez que traigo el tema con él, él se molesta y dice que ella sólo es su amiga y que no me preocupe porque ella esta allá y nosotros aca, pero sigue molestandome porque sigo pensando que es infidelidad... aún asi no sé si hacerle caso y creerle que no es nada importante.
20090307224337AAqGBr7	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Ending contact with Ex Girlfriend?	My fiance still gets the occasional message from his ex-girlfriend, just birthdays, christmas and new years, that kind of stuff. As they have been broken up for 4 years and we are now getting married I feel that they are unnecessary as they don't keep in contact in any other way and he doesn't send her messages, I feel she just wants to keep herself in his life.   Is it ok for me to ask his to request that his ex not send any more messages? or is this going a bit over the top?   Thank you.

20090307224811AA84nDe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need REAL advice, from ADULT men and women?	So my ex and i have been broken up for a while, (i am pregnant with his son). But since we split up he has been out sleeping with his ex's and doing things like that, but when he "needs" understanding or has something bad happens he calls me. He has lied about our son to people sayin he isn't his, and really dragged my name thru the dirt.      So my question is why does he still call me and tell me how much he loves me and wants to make things work? Especially when he is out with other females. (he knows i have no one else in my life so it's doesn't seem to be a jealousy thing)      Please someone help

20090307230042AANbRCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How young can I date?	I am 16 years old but, I am a senior in high school about to graduate. I am not going to be 17 until AFTER I start college. So, guys my age are sophomores and guys a year younger are freshman. I have always been attracted to guys my age and a but younger but, that would mean being with guys who are several grades below me. Plus, my friends are all basically freshman to juniors, a fewww seniors. So, my question is, how young can the guys I date be without it being super weird?      I am smart but, I am not a know it all. Also, I don't plan on having sex with any guys that I date so, that isn't an issue. Also, I want to keep up appearences as well. I don't want people to freak out because I am a college student dating a sophomore or junior, if that makes sense.      What do you think? Would it be too weird? How old is the youngest I can go?

20090307230523AAIVd7V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy-BF-BFF Problem.... guys and girls help please?	ok, i'm in a really awkward position right now. so my best friend has a crush on this guy, lets call him Max and she's Jess. So Jess has liked Max for god only knows how long, and Max definitely does not like her back in that way. they are really good friends and would make a totally bitchin' couple. but he doesn't like her that way so that sucks. but lately, i've been texting Max and we've been getting to know each other. turns out we have more in common than either of us thought w did. now i'm pretty good at ready signs and signals given off by guys, and he is hinting that he likes me. and it's really weird because (a) i have a boyfriend, and i totally love him. and i would do anything for him. and (b) Jess, my best friend, is totally infatuated with Max. it's like WTH??? he shouldn't like me, he didn't when i did. and i don't know what to do. i don't want to stop texting max because that'd be mean, and i don't want to tell Jess because she'd be ticked. and then if i tell my boyfriend, who is really protective, then things could get bad. so basically, there is a guy that my best friend likes, who likes me, even though i'm taken. but i used to like this guy, not that Jess knows that. so who should i tell, if anyone? do i just deal with Max? it's not like he is doing anything bad, but it makes me feel weird because he is friends with my boyfriend and yeah... i'm confused, and i don't really know what i'm asking.   sorry if you read this and got really confused, just know that i'm just as lost as you are. (in the event that you actually made sense of what i said, please feel free to comment and help me. that would be awesome)

20090307234625AASQXIi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would it be like to marry a Muslim man?	I am dating a ma who is Muslim from Pakistan but who spends most of his time living in Canada. I am non Muslim and from Canada.  He always talks about us getting married but he is also engaged to someone in Pakistan already through an arranged marriage that he said he will no longer do.  What would life be like?  Is it bad for a Muslim man to marry a woman who is not religious?  Would it even be possible for him to get out of an arranged marriage?  If he did tell his family that he didn't want to be part of the arranged marriage, would they hate him for it?  I don't understand many things that are Muslim because he doesn't really talk about it very much.  He makes things sound very peachy and the future bright, but I have a hard time believing it is.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this.
20090307231635AARfrWS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you get past the anger and terrible thoughts of a spouses affair?	I am new to this.I found out 5 months ago about his 4 year relationship/affair.We have been in therapy since I found out.My husband says he wants to salvage the marriage.The therapist wants me to write down all my bad thoughts.She says I am just traumatizing myself everytime I have these thoughts.   All I think about constantly throughout my day is what my husband did to me and our marriage.So I am screwed and digging myself into the deepest depression.I also think of the sexual acts,intimacy between them and how they could do that to me and my children.I speculate about a lot also.I know this home wrecker very well and she knows me and my children very well too, so it makes it so much harder.I would like it very much if she fell off the planet.I just don't know how to stop my brain from always having these horrid thoughts.It seems to me that the therapist and my husband never want me to express these things except on paper.Well, I don't work like that.I talk to my close friends but I  don't know if it helps much.I would like to talk this out with my husband but he would like to forget the whole thing and move on naturally.Does anyone have experience with what works getting rid of all the bad thoughts?

He has made is very clear to me that he is "very interested" in a sexual relationship with me. He has also made it very clear to me to allow my feelings for him to grow naturally. Which I have.

20090307231843AAwf7Iy	Family & Relationships;Friends	Bad Apple Girl Scout, what to do?	What can a leader do if there is one girl who is misbehaving so much that it's making hard on everyone? This girl is hitting the other girls, being rude, obnoxious, talking when she's supposed to be listening. When she's asked to stop doing something by the leader, lets say wait to eat until thanks have been said, she blatantly takes a bit in the leaders face. She talks back with the leaders and other adults. And when her mother is present, the mother sits idly by and just lets it happen. The girl just doesn't listen. The leaders have been very patient with this child, but it has gotten to the point where the leaders are hoping she doesn't show up to meetings and events because of the trouble this girl causes.       What are the options? Do the leaders have the ability to kick the girl out of the troop for the sake of the other girls? Especially after the girls mother has been approached about the situation and still hasn't stepped in to check her own daughter's behavior?      What's the professional thing to do?

My parents are way too over-protective and don't trust me, and i'm sick of it. i haven't done anything for them not too and for the past 2 years of my teenage years i've been sitting at home during my holidays. if they can't trust me, then how can i trust them.   if i want to go somewhere they'll just make excuse after excuse why i can't go even if i've proved them wrong. they ask question after question after question after question...it's SO annoying.i'm not allowed to stay over at my friends house and when they do finally let me go somewhere they'll call every 10 minutes. because of this, i find it hard to have friends, since i'm not allowed anywhere without being tracked down to make sure i'm where i'm supposed to be. my friends are allowed to go anywhere as long as they're home by 6.00 or whatever time. i'm not an only child or anything like that, but i just get so annoyed when they don't trust me that it makes me just want to leave. i'm 15 so it's not as if i'm some 10 year old trying to act older than my age. they don't listen when i talk to them, i have to repeat everything over and over until i get so p*issed off that i just walk out. what do i do, i'm sick of this?
20090307231030AA5WN7a	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do?!?!?	okay so there is this girl named maggie that i have known since 5th grade. last year we started talking and we instantly became best friends. we did everything together and had sleepovers every weekend, and we shared clothes and makeup and we had all of our classes together. we got into little fights, but we would make up after about an hour. but then about a week before school ended, she told me that she couldn't hang out all weekend because she was grounded. but on friday night she accidentally called me and i could hear a lot of our friends voices in the background. i texted her and asked if she was with any of them but she said no and i later found out that she was. we got into a huge fight over that and made up a few days later, but on the last day of school we got into another fight and didnt talk all summer. then right after christmas, we hung out again for the first time and i realized that she had changed a lot. she now has a boyfriend that is really nice and the most mature guy she has ever dated, but she spends ALL of her time with him. it really annoys me how much she ignores me and all of her other friends when she is with him and she is a totally different person from the best friend i had a year ago.    i want to talk to her about it, but idk what to say! can you help me out please?

20090307232404AAGVBNm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Did I do the wrong thing by ending the friendship?	Weve been best friends for about 5 or 6 years and I feel awful that i ended the friendship.It all started this year when she entered 8th grade (im in 10th). She got this boyfriend who was 15 (she was 13) and still in 8th grade. He was a druggie, alcoholic and always tried to argue with me. We got into a huge argument over her being wit him and in the end she chose him over me. I didn't talk to her for a while but she would still try befriending me again by iming me and stuff. She wouldn't give up and in the end we were friends agin. A month later we kept getting into arguments because of how rebellious she was. She even started carving things into her arm , stealing, taking large amounts of pain relief pills, talking about trying out drugs and it all really upset me, she refused to stop and said I was trying to change her. Some of her friends even told me it was "Art" that she was carving things into her arms and told me not to judge her and to leave her alone. She also always lied to me, and wouldn't be honest with me because she was afraid i'd get mad and disaprove, which is true because half the time I did. She had lost her virginity to the 15 year old on New Years eve, when we were talking about her and relationships she admit to me that she had dumped her previous bf for the 15 year old because she knew she could lose her virginity faster with the 15 year old. She said I had to respect her more and that it annoyed her that i couldn't accept her for who she was. She was all "at least my other friends accept me for who I am." But the things she did just bugged me so much! I feel awful because I feel as if I did the wrong thing. Another thing is that my friend whose comp she used to log on myspace had went on her myspace becuase she forgot to log off there computer read through some of her messages and she told people i was her only real friend. I felt so awful afterwords that I felt like crying, since I called her a lot of awful things when we stopped being friends i tried to apologize but she said shes sick of it. Did I do the wrong thing?

20090307225158AAkON4D	Family & Relationships;Family	Stripping father rights?	My ex went to court over a year ago to fight for joint custody of his 3 year old daughter. He was awarded weekend visits, sat 2pm to monday 6 pm. How ever shortly after he got custody he got a second job the second job made him work saturday overnights so he would sleep all day, leaving his mother to pick up his daughter then keeping her until sunday 5 pm because he got off at 7 am. and he wanted to get a little sleep. Well when she was at the house he would either make her sleep or she would spend the whole time with me. anyway when i was 2 months pregnant he cheated on me, he had the other girl come to the house while i was at work. While his daughter was there. the other girl got pregnant and had her baby 2 months after me. I didnt leave him i tried to make it work because he told me he wanted me to stay, he didnt want the other girl. so i stayed. Well that drama never ended she was so annoying and wanted him to be with her and evern threatened him that she would get an abortion or give the baby up for adoption. So the more he told her he would rather have the baby if she didnt want it the more she twisted him around her finger. He assured me he would never leave me because i was the only person in the world to put up with his crap, so i stood by him while they fought and he asked me repeatedly if i would stay with him if he took the baby away from her i said yes. Well he was working 2 jobs coming home to me and sleeping so i took care of his daughter, payed the bills bought the food, made sure the house was in order, and reminded him of the important dates and events he had to be involved with with his daughter. he was mean to her, he didnt want her to talk, if she did he ignored her and i would get mad at him for doing that. if she cried he yelled at her some times cussing at her. And when he did actually go out with her it was to his job to show he was a "good" father. After i had my son he pushed us all away, he because mean even to his daughter i asked him why he was acting this way he said he was keeping eveyone away to protect him self and he threw him self in to work. a few days after the other girl had her baby he pushed everyone out of his life, he told me he didnt like coming home to us and he felt guilty for everything so i left. I warned him that if i eft he wouldnt not see his son because i would not ask him for help with anything. he said that was fine. Now he is threating me to take me to court to get visitation, I have stable living arrangements, i have a car, i provide everything for my son food clothes dipers im working full time and my mom watches him while im at work. I never leave him with anyone for any reason (except once when i was take to the emergency room 2 weeks after he was born and that was one night.) people see me with him all the time. The only reason im not gonna get him for child support is because hes currently paying child suport for 3 other kids... so yes thats 5 kids for 5 diff women. He skips jobs every 3 months so that his wages dont get garneshed. Right now the only way his bills are getting paid is because he moved another girl in to the house 2 days after i left. his bills are more than 2000 a month he only gets paid 800 a month with both jobs combined. how ever his first job, has never notified child support he is working ther mainly because the rgm is his best friend. He also receives tribal checks every 3 months he dose not claim as income.

As he still continues with this relationship I had no option but to file for divorce. I have allowed him regular supervised access and have tried to remain amicable but he is just so nasty. He has demanded more contact and his solicitor has sent me a letter threatening if i dont comply I shall be brought to court. His new partner has a violent temper and due to her job she has access to a gun and I'm terrified of what could happen. My ex is rubbing it in that I cant do a damn thing and when he gets access he can take my baby anywhere he wants. She has never been away from me for any length of time and if she gets upset I know he wont phone me. I feel like he looks upon her as a possession and only wants contact as its his right.

I’ve lost friends in the past for various reasons like life changes or they just didn’t find me interesting anymore. However this time everyone feels different to me. I’ve been working and going to school almost full time so I have no time to chill anymore. Could just a few months apart tear apart a friendship that has lasted years? Am I the one changing things?

20090307230915AApDxoI	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Too many kids in one spot!!?	Okay my stbx is currently living with his girlfriend and her 2 children in a 2 bedroom apartment. My 3 children go there for his weekends and weeknight visitation. I have a serious problem with 4 kids in one room while my daughter is forced to sleep in her playpen. She will soon be out of her playpen then where is she going to sleep?! The genders for all kids are 4 boys and a girl, 2 of the boys being hers. I have an issue with my kids on school nights having to sleep in a room with 2 other children they aren't even related to! They have 2 beds in the room both of them being trundle beds. As a whole what's the legalities of 7 people in a 2 bedroom apartment? I would think the fact that he did not take my kids' living arrangements into consideration (they have no place to keep their things and basically live out of a suitcase every time they are there) is going to hurt him when it comes to our divorce. I provide adequate housing for them as all 3 have their own rooms. Anyone who knows anything about mixed genders in a bedroom (like I specified above should they put my daughter in the room with the boys too) as well as the current living arrangements my kids are forced to accept when they see their father help me out!

My mum and dad don't really get on and my mum tells me that my dad wasn't the best dad in the world; not helping with me and my brother or something about paying child support for me.   My dad says **** about my mum too...so I get two different sides to the same story some times.      My dad has had so many 'flings' that I have lost count and whenever he has another one I just feel sorry for the girl he is dating; remembering all the crap my mum says about my dad and the way he treats women.    Whenever he brings another girl into the house I get both mad and sorry at seeing the girl. I hate seeing him be the same old guy he's always been with woman and not changing and I feel bad for the girl because I know how it will end.       What do I do about this? I don't want to 'share' him anymore and see another girl crushed!

So this past summer, I met a guy that I really connected with on a friendship level.  A few months later, we started hooking up and developed feelings for each other.  However, he had liked a girl all of last year, and this other girl told him that she had feelings for him too.  He decided to pursue that, because he said the he had stronger feelings for her.  Well, it didn't work out, and a few weeks later, she broke up with him.  We still remain friends, but he said that he would rather keep it that way between us, and I don't think he wants to get back together.  Doesn't he see that it means something that I still want him after all of this?  What do I do to get him to see that having a relationship with your best friend is ideal?!

20090307233005AA9IkAp	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I stay, or should I go?	I have been working with y parents for 10 years now (I'm 29). In those 10 years we have expanded into 4 stores and then back to 2 stores. I have received less than 5 dollars in raises in these 10 years, but have gained a lot of experience. With there being a recession right now our sales have slumped. So I choreographed a major changed in the company, both on the floor and with the staff. It has worked and our business is getting back to where it once was. My issue comes from the fact that they still treat me like I'm the 18 year old who started with the company (even though I'm the "General Manager" now) I make only $13 an hour, salary. I pull a lot of overtime, while they skip off to their cabin at weeks at a time. Am I being duped? Should I take my experience elsewhere? Do you think they are taking advantage of our family ties?
20090307233052AAQBdMn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys help! does he like me or is this normal behavior?	does this mean this guy likes me or is this normally what guys do?   ok so this guy in my photography class, he has talked to me a couple times randomly and was smiling at me when he did, mentioning my eyes and random things only we would know (because we're both Irish), about nothing important, and seems to pop out out of nowhere directly in front of me or to my half of the classroom when we have free time to take pictures, more times than not. He hasn't talked to me again besides the first few times, but sometimes it seems he is looking my way, during classtime or lunch or when he is surrounded by his friends. I only have one class with him though, and i pass him every day only once in the halls, and he will only look at me once like he would i suppose to any person walking that way, and just keep talking. hes done somethings that are very strong pointers to him liking me or trying to get my attention, like being show offy, and when i move to a new area, moving subtly along to be loud again when he's close enough to me. the thing is that we are in different groups at school, and he hangs out with a lot of girls the majority of the time in his group (during lunch only). I haven't actually heard of him dating anyone, but what he does seems like he may actually really like me, and other times like i'm no one special. he will look my way a lot, and slometimes make a show of something or another when i'm near, and he's talked to me before. i don't know why he stopped either; i wasn't intersted at the time, nor boring. He is very outgoing though, so that also confuses me as to why he stopped talking to me all of a sudden. i really don't know, and any help whether this is normally how guys act or not, thanks to whoever answers, points to whoever makes the most sense-meaning please tell me honestly. i know everyone is different, and i'm aware that he might be a player, but i haven't seen the guy openly flirt or dating someone, and i'm actually pretty shy myslef, so i'm not going to aks him, but i don't know if i should act interested or just ignore him, and whether this is normal or if he likes me. Thanks!

My boyfriend and I have been together for 15 months now and he has NO interest in sex at all! I don't know what is going on, but its really taking a toll on my self esteem. I am 23 years old and he is only 28, when we first started dating our sex life was great, we never rushed into sex, we made sure we got to know each other very well before we ever had sex. I just can't understand what happened, it started about 7 months ago, we use to have sex around 3 times a week, now I am lucky to get it twice a month! we get along great, we have the same personality and we just "get" each other. he loves his job and he doesnt seem to be stressed out about work or anything else for that matter, he doesn't have many bills to pay, and he always pays his bills on time. he doesn't seem depressed about anything, he is usually very cheerful and goofy with me like he always has been. everything seems fine with us EXCEPT the sex! I really dont think he is cheating on me, he seems to love me very much & when he's not working he is with me. he just has no interest in sex with me at all, I've tried to initate it, I've went out and bought sexy lingere. I always tell him how much I love him and how attractive he is, I still have a brand new lingere set that I bought 5 months ago that still have the tags on them! another lingere set I bought, when I put it on he just didnt seem to be into it at all, he never complimented me on it, it didnt seem to turn him on at all really. we always cuddle and kiss, but other than that our sex life isnt there. he says I want sex too much, but thats not it I just want us to be normal again like we use to be. we have had arguements over this, and it doesnt seem to phase him at all. but its really bothering me alot because I feel ugly and un-attractive. there have been many nights when I cry myself to sleep because I cant understand what has happened to us. when we are together all we do is watch tv, if I try to turn the tv off so we can talk he ends up falling asleep and nothing gets worked out. my appearence hasnt changed at all since we started dating, I havent gained or lost any weight, I consider myself an attractive person! I'm still the same person I was. can you please give me some advice?? I'm desperatley seeking answers! thank you!

20060810132059AAOkmri	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I do the right thing...?	I’ve dated 2 guys this summer…the first one was an instant connection and we were really perfect for each other… he was a year older than me (just graduated… heading off to college this fall), had a decent job and was waaaay cute…well we’d been dating almost a month and then I went on a mission trip. This is where things started to get complicated…I hung around with a couple of friends (guy and a girl) who I see at school everyday but generally don’t hang around with because they’re a year younger than me… well, after being around them for practically 24/7 I started developing feelings for the guy… at first I tried to suppress the feelings thinking that my head was just messing with me…but after awhile it just got worse and I started flirting real bad with him (actually he started it… and I just didn’t have the willpower to stop him)… I was never technically the first guy’s gf… I just felt bad ...and he still doesn’t know. Well, when I got home… I just kind of shrug it off as … “what happened on the mission trip, stays on the mission trip” … after a couple days the guy I was dating decided to break things off because he didn’t want to be in a serious relationship with college around the corner….so instead of bawling my eyes out like any normal girl who is dating a great guy would do… I heaved a big sigh of relief… cuz I really didn’t even know what I wanted yet…so about another week passed and after numerous times of trying to get in touch with the second guy… I finally got a hold of him…I told him about the “break-up” and we almost immediately started hanging out/dating … this made my parents extremely uncomfortable because they thought I had just lowered all my high standards for dating boys and thrown them out the window… this boy was a year younger than me… we really didn’t have all that much in common (true) and could I really see myself in a long term future relationship with him? (not much past high school….) so after 2 weeks of this hanging out/dating/making out relationship… I decided that I couldn’t take things any further… and so I broke up with him…I didn’t want to get too deep in a relationship that I know would not end up as serious… and I didn’t want to lead him on and break his heart later (like at the end of the summer) … I just don’t know if I was truly acting on my feelings… or just taking the easy way out because I’m not comfortable dating someone whom my parents don’t approve of… I’m not sure if I did the right thing or not…       Additional Details      2 seconds ago   the fact that he is a year younger than me really had nothing to do with it.... my mom is a year older than my dad... I have no problems with dating a guy younger than me...except for this one had no car of his own... (not even his license bc of grades...) and not much of a job either ...

20090227120640AAiibKm	Family & Relationships;Friends	My girlfriend is an angel!!!!??? how can I repay her?	I need some nice ideas about what I can do for my girlfriend.   She's so amazing, she's such a sweet and caring girl, the most important person in my life. This is really important to me so let me tell you what ade me feel this way.   Don't get me wrong, I don't love her more for what she did but I guess I just fell in love with her one more time.    I was diagnosed with appendicitis on sunday. I've been cramping real bad all night and I threw up a lot. It was definitely disgusting but she was there with me all the time. She took me to hospital and was there all monday, she was there before I had surgery and right after it even before I woke up, she helped me with everything and has been so nice. I was released on wednesday so she took me to her home since I just moved to the city for college last summer and she didn't want me to be alone.    She's caring for me literally all the time, before school, she makes sure I'll be fine while she's gone preparing lunch and all that, she skips all her extracurriculars so she can be home with me early and when she's here she's taking her time talking to me, keeping me distracted from the pain plus keeping me entertained, telling me over and over again how much she loved me and she hoped I was gonna be fine soon. I always knew she was an awesome person but this is like miles above my expectations, like she's like my personal angel or something. I keep telling her how much I appreciate all that but I feel like it's not enough sicne there's nothing in thi world to show her how much she and all she does means to me. I mean she's only 17.    Any ideas about what I can do for her, something nice and lovely, I'm not really creative and besides that I'm kind of physically limited for th enext couple weeks.    Thanks!

20061216201128AAMQ1Ou	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are some ex-boyfriends so mean?	My boyfriend and I broke up a few weeks ago- we supposedly ended on a good note and the feeling was mutual since we were both pursuing different goals in our lives. I thought it would be mature. I have to accept the fact that we might bump into each othre once in awhile since we live in a small town and our jobs are almost right next to each other, so it's inevitable. I have been doing well eversince he and I broke up- while I do have my sad moments, I have been doing well in school and have even had an article (political-related) published in my local newspaper in the past week. This week when my ex and I bumped into each other around my workplace, he completely tried to ignore me, rolled his eyes at me and was rude even though he wanted to read the article. I haven't even called him nor have acted mean towards him and have tried to be nice to him during the times that we have been in each other's path. It's hard but I am still moving on.

20070108164657AAubUrV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys give me your honest opinion please?	A guy that I have a kind of friends or maybe more? relationship with did not get an e-mail I had told him I would send him.  He called me and we had talked for about a half hour & there were more things to talk about but I was still at work so I said I'd e-mail him.  He had told me he'd e-mail me back & of course I didn't get an answer but figured he just didn't want to bother answering me (he doesn't always answer when he says he will).        I had to send out another e-mail to a group of people (him included) & he used answering that group e-mail to let me know he didn't get the first e-mail I was supposed to send him.  He said he just wanted to let me know he never got it and it was no big deal.        I think he didn't want to send me an e-mail asking where my e-mail to him was but was happy to use the second e-mail to ask if I had sent it.  And to let me know it wasn't a big deal.  But is that the truth?        Guys--honest opinion.  Big deal or not to him?
20061211181508AAY6xJt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think he is still just playing with me.  Guys how often do you just play a girl?	We worked at the same company & he barged into my life & would send me music, showed me his buddies website, & talked to me about everything.  We spent as much time together at work as possible.  He had an out of town gf but he did things that looked like more than friends. Constant mixed signals including wanting me 2 go with him one Saturday night & meet his buddies.      At a co. function we thought we'd get 2 go 2 together it turned out we couldn't & he called me afterward & said all he'd wanted 2 do was be with me that day but he couldn't figure out how 2 make it happen.  He treated me like I was special 2 him but I told him since he had a gf I couldn't spend time with him much anymore & he said he just wanted to be friends.  But he wouldn't stay away from me & the mixed signals continued.             He has left the co & still calls me. We talk but not about what  happened. He's said when he can't deal with something he just doesn't. So, is he confused or am I just fun to play with?
20061226193225AA9dJmI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls pursue the guys most times now?	My friends and co workers tell me that for the most part girls pursue guys now and that guys kind of expect that girls make the first move.  They say girls call a guy they like all the time and often ask the guy out first.      I am shy and I don't do this and I wonder if that hurts my chances with guys.  It seems like a guy is interested in me and we talk alot but he doesn't ask me out.  My friends say guys are waiting for me to ask them out or in some way pursue them so they are sure I like them.      Do you agree???

Now, the thing is we were never a couple or spend any real time together for her to feel like that. We did see each other here and there, but most of the time we talked on the phone and that was over a span of 2 years!! If anything she was the one who always took a step back, if I came too close. We did see each other the other day, after 1 1/2 years that is, and after that she kept on rambling on via email how much fun she was having and the statement above. What the hell is going on with this girl? Plus she is not a warm or kind person by any means.

20061217154316AAWujSs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need a way to tell my boyfriend that he's being too controlling?	Okay here goes..   My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over a year and for a while he was perfect. At the beginning of last summer he made this "rule" that when school started I wouldn't be allowed to get into "deep conversation" with another guy. I could still talk to them about schoolwork or whatever. About a month went by and he changed the rule to say I couldn't talk to any guy unless I absolutely had to. Then it changed again to saying I couldn't talk to guys unless it was about my boyfriend. (This rule also applied to him and other girls, although it wouldn't bother me if he talked to girls, but he wanted to make it fair) Now the rule says I can't talk to any guys for any reason at all, I can't answer any questions they have and if one talks to me I have to be MEAN TO THEM. WTF! I've told him I didn't like this stupid rule and he'll ask "so you want to talk to guys?" What am I supposed to say to that? Please help!   Yes I know he doesn't trust me, he tells me!

I have a friend who has been through a lot—he has been divorced, his fiancé left him, his car broke down, he lost his job and even his girlfriend. The other day he told me something that I have never heard anyone tell me. He told me he heard the television talking to him. I was like that’s weird. Is stress doing that to him and is he depressed? Its like he is dazed or in another world because when I call him by his name he doesn’t respond sometimes.

20061203214233AASwHaG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible for a guy who professed his love to a girl to just stop loving for no reason?	I know a friend who is just facing a big problem, it is affecting her life and I am very worried about her. She and this guy met and started talking over the phone over which they both professed their feelings for each other. She is in college and he is working. After their last call she tried to contact him but has not been able to get thru. She thinks that he is avoiding her and that maybe he has moved on, however she just can't understand why he would just leave her in limbo like that? i keep telling her not to overeact but she can't help it/\. Now i am having doubts...why hasn't he tried to contact her? And how could he just suddenly fall out of love with someone like that?   This is baffling, I just want to know what you think...I just want something to tell her so she'll stop being so depressed.

My boyfriend is considerably more sexually experienced than me (this really doesn't bother me, and he's mine now anyway), but I am obviously more comfortable with my sexuality. He always seems uncomfortable after we have sex. After a romp yesterday afternoon, I was dozing off in the bed still unclothed. He jumped up and left the room (which he always does) and hollered at me to "put some damn clothes on." Anyone have suggestions on how to help him overcome this issue?

20061212112316AAmBkWh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it true there are no more good men out there?	People are always saying there are no good men out there in their 30's~they are all taken..(?) I'm thinking..its not that they are taken..they just don't exist.  You may think I'm cynical, but I have reason and those reasons, unfortunately are based on the men that I do know (friends, family members, co-workers, classmates...etc). It is so hard being a 30-something yr old single woman. I'm beginning to get discouraged. What do you think? Men or women?

20061210151332AAFLTpk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me?	Okay, so theres a really hot , and were pretty good friends. (he's really nice and quiet around me, but not with his friends which confuses me.) Sometimes we'll talk and have an real conversation.  But when we walk next to eachother to go to our next hour he'll walk really fast ( one time he was doing that and started racing me to class) and if i have something hanging off my pants he'll  come over and start playing with them. I'll catch him looking at me (even thoughone of my friends says he's not and the other one says he is .) and in music he moved behind me one day and it was a free day. I was writing a note to one of my friends and he was really quiet resting hishead on his hand "watching t.v." ( he wasn't) then these other guys lean over to try to read my note and i asked why they were reading my note and then my crush removes his hand and said I already read the whole note( see why he wasn't watching tv?) it was kinda embarrising because i said my butt hurt. so what do you think

20070105183330AAYAlla	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Best way to say you like a girl?	Hello again. Following my other question, I want to tell a girl that I like girl. Basically, heres the thing. We are 17, know each other for 6 months, and will be neighbors for a long time. I'm kind of sure she likes me, and I like her. I'm trying to find a way to tell her I like her, but I Really don't want to ruin the friendship if she doesn't like me (since we'll be neighbors for a long time). Should I wait, or should I tell her? I'm thinking of something like this: [I like her but if she doesn't like me we can still be normal friends, and just forget about what I have told her.] Is this possible? Staying friends after I said I like her (assuming she doesn't like me as a lover). Again, we'll be neighbors for a long time, I don't want our friendship to be awkward. So yah, thanks again.

Ok i'm on holidays up here at my dads place and I run into this girl that I like (Steph), and her mum (my mum knows her mum and they where up here because it was a family thing) so I am talking to her mother, and Steph didn't know who I was. Now I think she likes me, becuase her sister told me and becuase I have been getting signs like smiles and she always looks at me and laughs around me. She could have forgotton who I was because she only sees me with my mum and I hadn't seen her for about 6 months. After I told her what my name was she remembered(her own mother even said how can she forget me). But how could she forget me if she likes me? and what should I do?       P.s.

20070123133556AAEJZ9p	Family & Relationships;Family	What's a good name for our website that will follow our adoption from China & our new family life together?	As most people nowadays are doing blogs, I thought I would register a website and blog our journey to adopt from China. I would also like to keep up this blog when we return so that people can watch as we grow into one big happy family. I'd prefer to use my own site and not a .blogspot or similar site as I could get one of those right away. With security and anonymity being important, I'm not going to use my name or anything that would identify me to people.       Any ideas for a good website name? www.???.com
20070124001512AAyMAS2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Does he like me?	There's this guy i really like. He's the type of guy that doesn't tell you who he likes..and if he likes someone he wont approach her. he hangs out with his buddies a lot, and tends to just forget about girls. when i was hanging out with him i asked him who he likes and he said he can't tell me..so i asked him if i know this girl and he said "i think you do" i also asked him if he's going to tell this girl that you like him..and he said i don't know.      i text him the other day asking him if he would ever see me as more than just a friend. he said " he doesn't know..he never knows..its as possible as liking anyone else...we can only see with time" what does that mean.      before i left for christmas break, i gave him a kiss on the cheek and he kissed my cheek back..after i came back from my break..i hung out in his room for two hours for one day..i gave him an hour massage..we were really close..like i was kinda cuddling with him.      Does he like me??

20070126104933AAKZP1M	Family & Relationships;Family	Tengo un metodo para saber si el primer hijo de una pareja va a ser ni?o o ni?a!!!?	solo necesito saber el nombre completo de ella y el de él. enteros,con el nombre completo y los apellidos de ambos. si alguien quiere que yo se lo haga, encantada, la verdad es que es muy fiable.este metodo ha ido pasando de generacion en generacion por las mujeres de mi familia, y con el hemos calculado el sexo de todos los bebes que nacian, primos, sobrinos, y de amigos y conocidos. nunca ha fallado. ademas, sabiamos el sexo del bebe incluso antes de que la pareja pensara en casarse y mucho menos en tener ni?os. si alguno no me cree (que me ha pasado mil veces) pues que me escriba el nombre de alguna pareja que conozca y que ya tenga hijos (por ejemplo, el nombre de sus padres, o de sus tios...)y ya vera como yo se si el mayor es ni?o o ni?a.   este metodo no tendria nada de especial si no fuera porque no es necesario estar embarazada ( quiero decir, si ya esta embarazada, lo mejor es la amniocentesis o la eco, y ya esta) muchos besos a todos!!!!

20070127162941AAbtTJO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me?	I like this guy who is my best friend. We talk everyday and always end our convos. with an "I love you". He is very protective of me and when i say something about another guy he gets upset at me. I have been talking to another guy recentley and he has been really upset with me. He can talk to and about girls with me though "which make me mad". We have never met each others families before and over the holidays he was wanting us to meet one another and i just couldn't handle it, because that seemed a little weird to me. But, we have known each other for quite a long time now, but everything seems to be getting confusing. He has asked me to do sexual things with him, but i just can't. I really care about him and like him, i just don't understand the relationship he is wanting. Does he want to be just friends or does he want to be more than that?

Then someone yelled out "grab his c**k!" She laughed as several more girls egged her on. So she grabbed it and then all 20 or so girls started chanting "Stoke, Stroke, Stroke!" So she keep going stroking him until he orgasmed all over her hand and arm, then the women exploded in applause.      What should I do? I am shocked my girl could get wild like this.

That evening will be normal except he will touch, kiss, fondle, talk really dirty. Go to bed, no sex. Next morning, he will get me to the OH GOD jumping off point, but I don't finish. That evening is when the AWESOME sex takes place. (I know why am I complaining, right?) He never drags it out for more than 2 days, and he doesn't do it very often. Maybe once 2 months or so. I even try my best to get him to put out, but he doesn't. He holds his ground. No matter what I do, it's a no go. WHY DOES HE DO THIS????? HE'S DRIVING ME NUTS!!!

So this girl I really like was at a movie with me and we've been kinda on and off the past few weeks, and a week ago she told me she just wanted to be friends. A few days ago we were at a movie with some friends and we leaned in and started kissing each other.. which kinda went on throughout the movie. But sometimes she wanted to and sometimes shed move in then backoff... we burshed hands and held them for a bit but shed always take it back after about a minute and at the end of the movie she held my hand for like 20 minutes then on the way home in the car... yesterday my friend said he was talking to her and she told him that she just wanted to see if she liked me as more than a friend and wanted to see if there was a spark and she said there wasnt, even though the kissing went on for a long time and she seemed to like it... I definatly liked it. She told him she wasnt gonna kiss me anymore now that she knew and just wanted to be friends... AGAIN?! I feel played...

We recently decided to get back together. When we were apart he had met someone else and said they went out a couple of times as friends. When we were married, he never cheated. He said he called this woman and ended the friendship but he still sees her at work as she's a customer. I asked him what's her name and he told me it's irrelevent. I don't know why but I can't let it go. Why do you think I'm having an issue with this?

I'm 14 years old Male, and facing many things ...............      My mom treats me like s***t, she never listens to me, she always make me feel hopeless, terrible. She never made me a happy birthday for like 5 years, and yes that's right ! Fu*king 5 years with no birthday and event. When I try to talk to her, she doesn't listen as if I'm talking to nobody. She always swears when she says each sentence to me. and When I tell her about things about me, she keeps saying things that aren't right, like when I tell her, I'm more interested in health and fitness and exercising she keeps saying I'm stupid and other stuff, I really ignore but it's really annoying because I keep reading and reading about things I like. Another thing is she always keep telling me to do tiring things and she never thanks me. What do you think should I do ? Would be going to a psychiatrist a good idea ? I really need help A.S.A.P . Thank you.

20090227122033AAGjQvG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should my landlord be responsible?	rent an apartment, and I pay $60.00 a month for underground parking. I noticed that there was always water around my SUV, and not around anyones else. Then about a month later I started to notice these marks on my front and rear passenger side windown, and as well as the paint going down where the marks are is changing colour. I wrote a letter to the office of the building telling them what was going on 10 days ago and requesting a new spot to park in, no one got back to me. So today I wrote a letter to the property management, explaining what happen, and that no one got back to me when I wrote a letter, I feel as though they are not giving me a new spot because I gave my 60 days notice as well. But regarless I still pay to park my car, and it is getting damaged.    I provide picture of my truck, and the ceiling about that is falling apart, with mold and mildew on it.   Do you think that the landlor should be respoinsible for the damages? casue if I damaged the apartment of anything else in the building the would hold me accountable.    Does anyone know, cause I am very upset, this is my new 2008 truck.

I want to talk to her in person, like hanging out. how should i go about a low pressure way of getting myself back into her life again? I thought of saying to her: "i don't expect us to be a couple again,but i still care for u, and i'd like u as a good friend again, how about we hang out sometime, maybe go swimming too.?" Anyone have better ideas?

Should I call him and ask him if he got my text message, so I'll know for sure?  Should I wait a few days?  Should I assume he's not interested or just shy?

El gana mas que yo, pero su dinero se va en las cuentas. Se que se presiona mucho porque tiene dos trabajos, pero ya no se que hacer, no se preocupa por mi.

I talked to the manager & he told me to call in two days and ask for peter, and by then he would have reviewed my app and will schedual me for an intereview. However, I got offered a job at restaurant B about 10 minutes ago, and I accepted it. My question is, what should I tell restaurant A? I don't want to be on bad terms just in case it doesn't work out in job B, I can go in for an interview still. I'm thinking I won't call restaurant A tomorrow, but what should I say if they call me? I'm not sure the job I just acepted will work out because it just recently opened and I might not get very many hours, so I want to still be eligible for the job at restaurant A.   Thanks!      BTW - I'm a college student that's looking to get some extra cash...so please no mean comments about getting a better job.

The thing is I still feel like i love him so much. EVeryone thinks i can do better and i should move on but in my heart i dont feel like it should be over. What should i do??

20070725183645AApvGy6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I too picky in finding a girlfriend?	I see girls and I don't know why, but looks are important to me. I like a girl with good looks - not ncessarily dazzling, but beautiful (and on the OUTSIDE, the inside is imortant but I only check out the inside if the outside is good)    Girls with ok looks (that don't do it for me) but have good insides become good friends in my book   I'm very flirtatious and I flirt with everyone. I'm a great talker and perfect listener (I shouldn't brag) but I just don't search around seriously. I don't go places to find girls - I'm not that type of guy. I go to clubs to have fun, not to pick up girls!! Some say I'm a charmer, but you wouldn't know that from where you're sitting so that's no use... but the fact is, I can't find who I'm looking for. And well, like any 18 year old, I want a gf, to spend my time with when I want.    So, what is it? Am I too picky? I haven't found the right one? Or maybe I'm not taking it too seriously

20090227122853AAvhazQ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Reception entertainment ideas?	I've come to the conclusion that there won't be too much impromptu dancing at our reception (looking at the guest list). Does anyone have entertainment ideas that are relatively inexpensive that might be fun and keep people occupied?        I've seen ideas such as hiring a dance instructor to teach basic dances and get everyone involved (line dancing? polka? disco?) for an hour or so, and hiring a caricature artist.      I just don't want people sitting around staring at an empty dance floor!

20070530101857AAmZW5r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are men so cold?	I have been dating this guys for a couple weeks. I have known him for 6 years. We also dated a long time ago, we were both different people then and it didnt work. This time around everything was great for the first couple weeks. We live about 2 hours apart, which has become an issue. He talks about having me move in with him, but I am not ready for that. Now he has become distant at times, then in a flash he misses me. I dont understand? When we are together he wants me to live there and he's sorry and then when I leave he doesnt call when he says he will, goes out drinking and calls me in the middle of the night. At this point I have had it, I am tired of this erratic behavior. I dont understand, I have been nothing but nice and honest. I feel like I am being played for a fool, and thank god I didnt make a bad choice and move.. Any ideas on what to do at this point would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

20070418161457AAbStw7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me or is that the way he is?	Well there was this one time when I was studying he came over and asked what i was doing I was also very stressed for this big test, and I told him and he said don't worry about it he also came back later to ask how it was going but I had my headphones on. He also stood there forever after that.      - Before I went to the star thing I had choir practice, and before we left he came over with his friend, to ask us where it was going to be at. My friend and I didn’t know either so we called my friend who knew about it. The weird thing was was that his brother was already there, who he came with, at the star thing. When I came with my friends I saw him there and so when we came we sat down we were going to sit on the floor but we moved to the chairs he did the same and sat right behind me and there were a lot of other chairs open. During it he would make fun of the pictures and what not. At the end I chucked my scarf at him and he kept pulling on it and wouldn't let me have it back. We went outside to look at telescopes. One of the kids had problems with his so I went over the kid I like went over to look at it he couldn't see so i pulled out my cell phone for the light and I saw him smiling. When we went over to look at the big telescope he and his little brother were running around me I guess playing not sure, but the kid next to me “guys stop being flirts” so yeah…      - On New Years eve I went to a Black tie party, I went out side after dancing and when I tried to get back in it was locked I then called my best friend to chat and to keep my mind off of being out in the dark (I hate the dark) so I called and asked if she could help me to call my friends or something. And well he was at her house. I asked if should could like come over and rescue me and what not and then he got on the phone and said he would come and save me. This was a minor story, but I felt like sharing. ^.^         - Ok so during school I had to do a play, it was really for the older class but they needed more people so I had to even though I didn’t want to. After my part was done I didn’t have to go back up. (Thank god!!) He was talking to much with his friend so he got moved. I thought he was farther from my chair, but he was right in front of it. So during the play he would keep turning around to comment on the play. I had a meeting with my teacher to sing some song for something, after that I when back to get my jacket and he came by to ask me what he said who knows why because he came in not to long into the convo. So that was one of the moments.      - While at my graduation he gave a speech and while he was up there I could feel someone stare at me and when I looked at him he was staring at me even almost during the entire time he spoke to.

I get jealous when i see that they are having a good time, like one big happy family and i don't have that no more. He says i can't let him be with his family without us fighting.

I am a good looking guy who is hard working and motivated but I cant seem to get any relationship going. All my friends at school who are girls are in relationships and anyone who is single isnt my type. I tried online dating but all that made me even more depressed. Any girl I was interested in wasnt interested in me and any girl who was interested in me I wasnt interested in them. I feel so lonely. This really affects a lot of aspects of my life. What should I do? I feel like I am a loser, ugly and pathetic and I will never find a girl
20090227124257AAs1QQ1	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I Just A Really Jealous Person?	Well Here's a Few Examples..      - My BESTEST Friend,Georgia, Asked if she could get 2 yahoo accounts (in one of her questions) for asking 'private questions she dont want her friends to see'   We have been best friends for 11 years and i have never kept any secret from her, and i didnt think she had any from mee..   And i was sitting there thinking    'So she would rather complete strangers know about her personal problems than her best friend?'   :'(   Or am i just a Jealous Person? Or am i going way over the top?      Another example;   - Me and my other friend walk home and have really funny times and i go round her house quite a lot and i do feel out of order for leaving Georgia out but i always forget when we play the Playstation2.. But if i here them talking about something funny that happened beetwen them i always try really hard NOT to listen or to change the subject... Coz i think i get a bit jealous.. even thou georgia doesnt see her as much as me..   Am i a jealous person ? :(
20090227124336AAGzstG	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is so mean to me?	okay so yanno how like everyone is really concerned about weight. yeah well i think im fine, im 5 foot and 4 inches and weigh 110. but sometimes out of no where she'll be like, your so fat. and for no reason. honestly she is fat, like bigger then me. and like now im starting to compare myself to yanno celebs and models and im starting to think im fat. and when ever i get in fight with my brother, she just blames me. she doesn't listen to either side of the story, always me. and im like how bout u actually listen to me. but then she goes crazy on me. and my brother is older, im the youngest in the family.and she yells at me for no good reason like all the time. when i try to tell her she just yells at me more. and like every once in a while she notices im hurt by her comments, she pretends she didnt do anything and calls me like sweatie or honey. i mean dnt pretend what u just said never happened. i mean she never says that besides those times. she doesn't care how i feel she only cares about my brothers. i mean im the 1 who's going to a charter school and got in 1 of top 100 high schools in america. but my brothers dnt and dnt give a crap about grades. when they graduated middle school they got like presents and all this love from her. but she hasn't said a word about it to me. and sometimes she hits me, not like lighty touch. like aggresive slap, never to anyone else. and no reason what so ever either      what do i do?
20090227124541AAbXxjM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	New last name method?	As I see it, there are various ways people could go concerning their last name when they get married or decide to live together, etc.      In my examples I will use March and April as the last name of the two hypothetical people.      1. One last name would is used. These two are now known as      Mr. & Mr. March     Ms. & Mr. March     Ms. & Ms. April     Mr. & Ms. March   2. Both keep their individual last names.      Ms. March and Mr. April   3. Both last names are used.     Ms. March-April      Mr. April-March   4. The two combine their last names.     Mr. and Ms. Aprich     Ms. And Ms. Marril     Etc.      Not too hard to understand, I hope.       I personally think that 1. Suggests dominance of one of the partners, intended or Not.    I find that 2. preserves the individuality of the two.    3. Fosters togetherness  somewhat.    4.  In my opinion represents togetherness the most since it is     A product of both names combined. Some tinkering may be needed to produce an  ideal name.               I realize this isn't anything really new, but nonetheless the name combining thing is not something I hear much of. It's mainly just the name of the guy is given to the wife and that's it.            But perhaps this isn't looked at much with good reason...maybe.       But whatever. It’s not like I know anything. Though it may seem a small thing,  and maybe it is, I tend to look at all the facets of the gemstone. Hah!          What do you think about this? What do you think would be the ideal way    to go about this? Who knows, maybe my opinion may be changed.
20090227125213AAyNbHi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can an insecure person, like my humble self, build confidence to make friends and approach women?	I'll be brutally honest.  I have no confidence, or self esteem.  I used to have it, i think, a long time ago, but somehow i lost it.  Not only am i unable to make friends and meet women, i don't even know how to approach strangers, and start talking to them.      I am 100% socially inept, and quite self concious about everything to the point that i have become neurotic and paranoid.      With all that, i am willing to pick up a hammer and start fixing this, but before i start whacking away in a aimless frenzy, id like to know some tips to improve myself from you fine folks.      So lay it on me, what must i do?      Thanks
20090227124711AAHR89i	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be feeling guilty for what I did to my ex?	My ex-boyfriend dumped me recently and I told one of my good friends about how he did it a week after we had sex for the first time. I told her that I felt pressured into it by him, which I was, and that I regret it a lot. Although he was really pushy about it, I did agree to it though... Well, turns out she told one of her friends, who told another and it just spread.       He also dumped me on the same day that his ex(and best friend) broke up with her boyfriend. And I did tell several people that I thought that the timing with that was suspicious. It was wrong, it was gossipy, and I regret it. I was just really hurt and wasn't thinking when I told certain people that. It got back to my ex and now he's furious with me. He thinks I'm trying to ruin his reputation.       Even though what he did to me was really messed up, I still feel really horrible. My best friend(not the one who spread the rumor) told me that I shouldn't though, and that it's not my fault. And deep down I really do think that he probably wouldn't get together with his ex. But I don't know, it was suspicious, and I was pissed off so I blabbed...      Is what I did really that bad though? Should I be feeling guilty? What's the best way to handle this mess?
20090227125650AAF4lwa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i learn how to stop being jealous? Serious answers only?	Me and my girlfriend have been going out for 3 months and we've fought about this a few times.. i always get jealous when she talks to other guys or calls them and she doesn't call me.  should i be jealous?  I've come to realize that i'm getting jealous every time she talks to another guy.  I absolutely trust her i just don't want to loose her.  I always try to realize im getting jealous of the guys she talks so and i realize again that i talk to other girls a lot.  We get along great and besides that we've had a great relationship.  Could this also be because my mom left my dad when i was 12? And could i be scared my girlfriend will leave me like my mom left my dad and broke a 18 year marriage?  I also trust all of my friends and were always hanging out together and i don't think any of them would do things with her like flirting and stuff.  Thanks.

20070522040303AAbOOjm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	?Que puedo hacer?	Amigos, soy un hombre de 50 a?o, estoy casado desde hace 18 a?os y tengo un hijo de 14. En la época en la que conocí a mi esposa, yo tenía un bajo concepto de mi mismo y muy baja autostima, por lo que aún si estar enamorado me casé con ella, ya que no esperaba que ninguna mujer se pudiera fijar en mi. Ahora las cosas han cambiado, he hecho varios cursos de mejora personal y he aprendido a pensar de manera más positiva. Bueno esto me está creando un  problema, pues ahora vienen a mi vida personas que antes ni so?aba que pudieran acercarse. El caso es que he conocido a una mujer estupenda, posee todo aquello que yo siemplre he deseado, es positiva, llena de vida y encima es bella. Ella me gusta y yo se que le gusto, en realidad nos hemos enamorado el uno del otro, pero esto me crea un gran sentimiento de culpabilidad con respecto a mi esposa y no ser como actuar, estoy hecho un lío. Creo que haga lo que haga habrá sufrimiento. Ahora que empezaba a pensar de forma positiva.

20070528145847AA2OGPX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you love more than one person?	I have the most wonderful boyfriend in the world. He treats me great, he's fun to be around for the most part but lately he's been depressed about some things and it feels like he's pushing me away. In that time, I've started to talk to a friend of mine that I do have a romantic history with and we are getting closer. I love my boyfriend and I know that he's going through a tough time right now and I know he loves me, I feel horrible to even say that my feelings for my ex are resurfacing but I'm torn between the two of them.  My boyfriend has never done anything to hurt me, where my ex has hurt me in the past but lately we seem to have an incredible bond. I haven't done anything with my ex, but the feelings are there. I know its not fair to my boyfriend and I want him to be the only one I love but I'm not sure what to do right now.  They are both a huge part of my life and I'm afraid to hurt both of them. Does this make me a horrible person?

It is a shame that no matter what you do for the man, he can not appreciate you.  You know Steve Harvey said it best, he said that "You should not be with a person to make you happy, You should be with them because they make you happy."  Very strong words.  I have come to the point that I'm not happy in my present relationship, so what do I do??  I love this man with all my heart, but he consantly does **** to make me say damn, what da ****.  Well I guess that is just how he is, so I hope he finds a woman that doesn't mind feeling like second.   Now matter what I have did, he would show me **** to let me know that is not going to work.  I guess you can't love someone who doesn't really have love for themselves.  I am really struggling with this, if anyone has anthing  that will help let me know.

20070611081634AAYg5u8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does my ex girlfriend post weird messages?	she'll make her msn message things like:      "Sticks and stones may break my bones but whips and chains excite me"      " I had the best night on saturday, WHOOOOT!!!"

20070612161550AAb6CaF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell her and when?	I've know this girl for about 3 years and we've been hanging out with each other a lot lately, like an entire 26 hours together and we slept only 4 of those, we spent the night in the same bed and I believe she was giving me signs to kiss her, I was like 95% sure, but I held back. A few days after that we hung out and I said, there is something I have been meaning to do for a long time, and I leaned in for a kiss. She pulled back and I said what can I not kiss you? She said don't make it any harder and don't be disheartened, and she said she was going through drama and I asked if that mattered and she said she didn't know why it did but it did. She then said she's thought about it and held it back, I said I had too. She then said don't worry it'll happen. We've hung out since then and everything seems normal. She called me out of the blue one day after that and asked if I wanted to come over to her house and hang out for a while and I came over we watched TV and talked until she had to work. I’ve visited her at work as usual. I asked her out to dinner recently, not really as a date but not really as friends, it wasn't classified. She asked if her married friend could come along, I didn't want to be mean and said yes, because it technically wasn't a date. While we ate she seemed more flirty and touchy feely towards me then usual. Then her and her friend were throwing peanuts at each other and one went down her shirt, I’m not sure if she was joking but she said do you want to get that to me. I was laughing too hard and said I’ll get the next one. She goes oh you'll get the next one? I said yes. Then we went to hang out after dinner and while she was telling a story, she kept touching my face to prove her point. Then we went bowling, while we were bowling she said something to her friend, when I asked what she said, her friend said she said she likes you. Then the girl I like said that’s not what I said, then I asked her what she said and she said oh your falling behind the bowling game. Then once we were on our way home she mentioned this other guy she likes that her dad is trying to hook her up with, that she has mentioned before and she keeps telling me she likes. I'm not sure if she's telling me that to make me jealous or what. But she has went to where this other guy works and left her number for him, and when she mentioned him she said I wonder if he got my number. Then when she got home and after I got home, she called me to say thank you, we talked on the phone for another hour, then I told my mother goodnight and I love you too while I was on the phone. Then the girl said oh you do? I said well yea, but I was actually talking to my mom. She said I know I just wanted to see what you said. The next day I visited her at work and we discussed going out again we didn't set up a time or date we just ensured that we would. I talked to her the next day on the phone for a few minutes about getting a job where I work and how to apply then about random stuff, then her mom said something, then she said I know and said she had to go. I’ve talked to her since and we had planned to go out tonight to dinner. Then when I called her she said she started dating another guy this morning, which isn’t the guy who her dad was trying to get her with. I can’t just ignore her like many of my friends have said I still love her either way, she’s a friend. Now she wants me to go out with her and the other guy tonight. I’m planning on going, because she wants me to and not to be mad at her. I’m not really mad just disheartened. I was wondering if tonight I should call her after our outing and tell her straight up, why aren’t you dating me? Is that the way to go or should I write a letter or leave it be or what? Or should I call her right now and tell her?

Well that day came and I chickened out and didn't do it. The thing is I'm kind of glad I didn't, because I hardly talked to him all year because I was so embarassed. I always think I look ugly. x_x So it would be so weird to just go up and say "Hey wanna go out with me?" because that's the only thing I would've said to him pretty much all year. Also, I don't know what I'm supposed to do if he says no. HELP! ='(

Now I have become very self conscious and feel that this guy is a bit out of my league? How do I approch him, and i am the kind of girl that when there is a guy I like I tend to frown as opposed to smile. I dont feel very attractive at the mo lol any ideas?

And sometimes I catch him looking at me, or staring at me. When I look his way he just sits there and still stares. I was in an elavator with my friends and we were all talking and I go "I need to get to my room and dress into my nice clothes" and he turns around and goes "you need to get undressed is what you need to do." Then were at the pool and I decide to stare at him, see if he notices and after about a couple seconds he does, and he looks at me. Does he like me? I mean he barely knows me!       He is not much older then me btw. & I really think he thinks I'm 18 because his other friend thought I was 18 untill a few days ago. I've known his other friend for 2 years. Lol. I look older.

He let me know for the time we were togeather that he was happy when he was with me and admited to me that he is scared of his own happiness.

20070710205058AAZn8Ch	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend leading me on?	My boyfriend has a child with his ex and he hangs out with both the child and the ex a lot together. Obviously he needs to be there for the child and I would never want to cause any problems in their relationship.  But he tells me he doesn't want to hang out with his ex but has to because the child needs to see them together and being civil.  About a week ago he invited his ex to his dads birthday party  and not me- I of course was pretty upset about this.  He said he only did because he had no choice and that he didn't want to hurt me.  His ex and him had a very disfunctional relationship and never could get along.  He also says that he's been his happiest in the last 5 months that we've been together.  I am trying to be understanding and would never in a million years want a child to suffer for me being jealous but I can't help but feel that it is weird that they still hang out and do family things together.
20070710221103AAQrWCb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help!! I can't stop crying!!?	My boyfriend and I will both be leaving for college within the next few weeks. We have been dating for two years and have become amazingly close! I can't stop crying because I know that we will probably end up splitting up. We act like best friends not boyfriend/girlfriend so i am really going to miss him. He is the reason I get up in the morning and the one person who can make me smile when I'm sad. He doesn't like to talk about  what we are going to do when we go to college but I am pretty sure he knows (as do I) it won't work out because we are going to be too far apart. We want different things in the future as far as a family goes. He doesn't want to  get married and he hates kids, which are two things that I defiantly want. I just don't know what to do...I cry myself to sleep every night just thinking about the day when we will have to say bye at the end of the summer. I love him so much and I just can't get over the fact that he won't be with me every day to make me smile.

20070724011933AA1vemB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'd had been complaining about all the losers I'd been meeting so a sorority sister suggests *continued...*	I start picking my own guys instead of letting them choose me.  She said to browse myspace (she did and met an awesome guy that she's been with for over a year).  So I decided to give it a try just for kicks, not really trying to "find" a guy and I clicked on this guy's page and got a strange feeling of deja vue and butterflies when I saw him and began to read about him.  I can't describe the feeling.  I've never felt anything like it before and it sort of freaked me out.  We have so much in common its scary.  It felt like I was reading about myself.  I can "see" myself in this guy.  I'm aware that people often feel a connection with those that have common interests, etc. but it was totally different. I sent this guy a message making casual conversation (not implying that I "liked" him) and he just ignored it, but I have a gut feeling deep down not to give up on him, like what I felt is real, its just not the right time to meet yet. *continued...*

20070730214600AADYmsB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend and I had a got into a fight. Who is right?	My boy friend and I have been together for more than 3 years. He lives an hour and a half away from me. He has a lot of personal things going on right now, including that he doesn't have a car. Since I am the only one with a car I am the one that drives back and forth to see him. We both are 19 and still live at home so we don't spend the nights at each others houses or things like that. There is a bus that would take him from his house to mine but it would take about 6 hours round-trip and he would have to take a day off work. I feel like I am putting in more effort in our relationship and would really appreciate it if he would make the effort to come to me by the bus. However, he says that I am just being unsupportive. I try to support him in every way that I can but sometimes I get sick of being the one to constantly drive to see him. Am i right to want him to make an effort or am I just being unsupportive!? Please help I am so confused

Anyway he dated for like 3 years and its been 2+ years since we broke up, im over him there are not  more feelings left, but what i miss is the feeling i got when i was with him.  I have had other serious relationships after him, so my question is.  Do you think i felt this way about my first boyfriend because i was so young (15-17) or have i just not found the right guy after him? thanks!

20070811213401AAYZFe2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My ex's status is on invisible. He says he wants to marry me and love me. What should i think of this?	Well, he has a new girlfriend who's married. He says he loves me, wants to be with me, and still want to marry me. We were making plans to get married last year but i broke up with him because i felt he was lying to me. It hurt me and it seemed like it hurt him. Just a couple of months ago before i found out he had a girlfriend. He was making plans again to marry me. When he stopped he told me he had a girlfriend who was a married woman. Now it seems like he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. He has his yahoo status on me on invisible and when i write to him he doesn't reply. When i do speak to him and tell him how i feel he says i've got him all wrong. That he still has those feelings for me etc. I use to speak to his g/f but stopped because she was hurting me with the things she was telling me. She has access to his accounts. So she was constantly telling me that he doesn't love me, and doesn't want to be with me nor speak to me. But i want him to tell me and he's not communicating.

We've been doing this for 3 years, so i dont doubt we can do it, it's just so hard on us both. Don't be an a.s.s and say it wont work, you have no clue about the relationship and how much we've been through. DONT SAY IT. It's getting to the point where we're just..lost without eachother, i mean really DEPRESSED when we're not talking, which is only the time he's away..He's said he feels like dying, as there's so much pain involved. I really dont know what to do, I've NO plans whatsoever of leaving him, nor him me, just dont mention it. But..we're eachother's life, and we cant stay away from eachother, but we're forced to..Don't know what to do..im sorry if this makes no sense, im just..breaking down. WIthout his love i'd be dead already..Help..

He always brings his credit card and uses it as an excuse not to buy anything. We are going to Six Flags tomorrow and I want a keychain after we ride Kind Da Ka. I asked him if we could get a keychain after we ride it. His answer was "If you have money." We have been together five years! This is ridiculous. We never go out or do anything b/c he doesn't want to spend money. We had to cancel our vacation for next week b/c he had no money. On my 20th birthday he took me to the beach which was nice but he brought hardly any money. He ended up buying stuff on the boardwalk for his Mom! He bought her a anklet and didn't even ask me if I saw something I liked. I am so frustrated he is boring and cheap!

So i feel like im a pretty good lookin guy (kinda on the short-side, only 5'7)  but still I do alright.  I have no problem talkin to girls at a house party when im around my friends and they introduce us and I usually end up doing alright (either gettin #'s or closin the deal).      The problem though is when im in the club or just out and about.  I am great at making eye contact with the girl and she will do it right back but the problem is the next step.  "initiating the conversation is half the battle."  FOr me its more like 75% of the battle.  Any ideas/advice?  I just dont want to seem really awkward or weird when I walk up with some stupid line.  I need something a little bit smoother.  Any advice is greatly appreciated.

20070820084632AAb5Y3U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question- Please provide your honest opinion?	John and Mary was in a trusted relationship. After few months John and mary didnot like when both would talk to their friends of opposite sex. eg. John would get upset when Mary would talk to her guy friend or vise versa. To solve this problem both agreed on not to talk to any friend of their opposite sex. One day John got a text message from his friend (with whom John was cool in college days) for directions to a club and John asked Mary if he can reply to her message, Mary said Ok and John replied.      Another day Mary's friend from college (whom she consider as brother) lost his mother and wrote on Mary's myspace wall couple of times. Mary never replied back due to the agreement. One day Mary asked John if she can reply back to her friend who recently lost his mother and John got upset. John said to Mary that he has lost respect for her. and they broke up.      Whos fault was it? Mary's or John's? Please advice. Thank you

20070827182845AAKID65	Family & Relationships;Friends	Que piensas si tu novia te cuenta que te fue infiel?	si tienes una relación de apenas 3 meces y tu novia te llama un dia y te cuenta que te fue infiel, aunque solo se beso con el chico y tras de eso esta pasando el fin de semana en la casa del chico que pensarias que por que lo hizo o mas bien por que te conto por ver como reacionabas o por amor como ella te dice.   - ustedes como hombres lo contarian que fuerón infieles.   bueno yo le conte por que de verdad lo quiero.
20070827183110AA8OBRZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	?Es cierto que la paciencia es una virtud?	La persona que amo, se siente mal, y quiere estar solo.    El es un poco depresivo, y se aleja para no hacer sufrir. El problema es que el se aleja, y me hace sufrir.   Me pidió que nos separemos, y que espere.   ?Qué hago, realmente debo seguir esperando?.   El es sincero, simpático, me hace sentir bien, no me trata mal y siempre me ayuda en lo que puede. Para mi vale mucho la pena.   Pero que pasa con mis sentimientos y el dolor que siento al no tenerlo. ?Debo esperar?

20070827183530AAAPKtA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	? me quiere ?	Tras casi 5 a?os enamorada de un hombre, hace 2 dias le declaré mi amor. Se quedó descolocado. Le costaba asimilar todo lo que dije. Me dijo que hace 4 a?os se habia encari?ado conmigo, pero yo pensaba que no le interesaba y sali con un chico (del que nunca estuve enamorada), con lo que el me quito de su cabeza. Después de la declaración, hablamos mucho, y me dijo "ma?ana seguimos hablando". En los 2 dias siguientes no ha mencionado el tema, no ha dicho nada y yo no quiero sacarlo para no agobiarlo, a fin de cuentas yo ya lo he dicho todo.   Me gustaria contar con algún consejo sobre su reacción. La verdad es que 5 a?os en silencio son demasiado y ahora no tengo ni el si ni el no. Llevo 2 dias sin dormir y los nervios van a acabar conmigo...

Nada mas q 4 meses de los cuales 2 fuimos "novios", al principio era sexo todos los dias hasta con el correr del tiempo nos chocamos con los sentimientos, formalizamos, vivimos cosas muy lindas, su entorno sabia de mi (supongo) y el mio tambien. Ella venia de romper con su ex 2 semanas antes de conocernos y al toque pense "clavo q saca a otro", le dije, lo nego, le dije de nuevo, lo nego. hasta q un dia ya con mas confianza en los 2 me dijo "si, fue por sexo q t conoci, pero ahora siento cosas" en un lapso prematuro decia q m keria y luego decia q me amaba!, yo m dije "que rapido q se sienten las cosas" yo le creo q me kiere pero q nunca m amó!. Hasta q un dia empezo a cambiar, acuso problemas laborales, fliares, $, y en si de ella, q le pesaba la edad, q yo tenia q estar con chicas de mi edad, que keria cortar xq keria estar sola sin ningun hombre, y si solucionaba todo y si keria estar conmigo me iba a dcir, d ahi en mas todo estaba en mi!

20070908100907AAWbrrx	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you do when a person does not listen to you?	I work for someone and at the same time we are friends.  He works in a field in which I'd like to grow and I often make connections every time I work for him.  At the same time he considers me as a friend except I feel that it's all about HIM.  He's always talking about his wonderful projects, etc.  He will sometimes want to know how I'm doing but as soon as I start to talk he'll often interrupt and continue one about himself.  It's really annoying and disrespectful.  I would tell him to shut it if he were a friend friend-but he's my boss/friend.  How can I moderate the situation to make it workk for me and not against me?

20070914223636AA2FCxi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why does my younger sister think that everyone's so jealous of her?	My sister is 5'6 and a lot smaller. She's tiny. I'm nearly 5'9, bigger chested, and bigger (but not unattractive.) I feel I'm prettier even if she's smaller. I know not EVERY guy wants a short petite girl, some like tall girls.      So why does she always claim that I'm "so jealous" of her? She made such a huge deal of my boyfriend talking to her. He is friendly and chats with EVERYONE. He used to talk to her a lot after he first met her and she of course takes everything the wrong way. Then he didn't have much to say to her after that because she has a habit of making snide comments about people. So, she confronted me and asked me why he doesnt' talk to her anymore, at the same time her boyfriend asked him if I told him not to talk to her anymore out of jealousy. When I confronted them both, they both said, well you have to admit your boyfriend talked to me an awfully lot before, and now all of a sudden he doesn't!      My boyfriend then could no longer stand her because of her ego, and over
