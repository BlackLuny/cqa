Place inside an average sized suitcase.   Is it possible for a person to carry 5 million pesos? Is it not too heavy? Paper os solid, therefore it has weight. I had to argue that its physically impossible for an average filipino/asian to carry such a heavy piled up paper by himself. Let alone fit in a suit case. Am I correct?      FYI - Our biggest denomination is 1000 peso bill, similar size of that of a dollar bill. to calculate weight 1000peso bill is closely the same weight of a dollar bill.

Also is double major only benefical if the two majors are completely different? has anyone double majored in bio + biochem?       the reason for double majoring is because i am about to finish all the requirements for biology degree in my sophmore year if i choose to therefore, it leaves me with a whole senior year and a summer term that i do not know what to do with. there is the option of getting some sort of minor but i have several biochem courses finished and because the two majors are similar the double major seems like a better idea?

Alright, einstein's model of the universe uses the imagery of space being a a fabric on which everything lies to explain gravity. Something with great mass will indent the fabric and everything in it's area will rolll into that indentation. Much like a trampoline. The problem that i see with this though, is when on earth the force that causes a ball to roll to your feet when you stand on a trampoline, is gravity. So what causes objects in space to be attracted to these indentations? It cant be gravity because gravity can't explain itself.         Somebody want to expand this for me so I can make sense of the concept?

Find the absolute maximum and absolute min of the function f(x)= x^3 + 3x^2 - 1      F is defined at [ -3, 2 ]      I put his in my calculator and came up with the table      x- / -3 / -2 / -1 / 0 / 1 / 2 /   y- / -1 / 3 / 1 / -1 / 3 / 19 /      I know they picked (2, 19) for the abs. max. because it is the highest Y value and 2 is an end point.      BUT for the minimum,      Since -3 is an end point, would the absolute minimum be   (-3, -1)?      Can someone please confirm that since the MINIMUM values both occur in two locations, they can only be Relative minimums, so you have to do the first derivative?

Do any of you UFO researchers think that there is a possibility that the Rendlesham Forest UFO (aka Bentwaters) is connected to the Dayton UFO incident (Cash Landrum incident)? The Dayton UFO sighting happened just one day or perhaps mere several hours after airmen at Bentwaters base in England sighted strange floating lights moving through the forest along with a strange craft. Then Betty Cash, Vicki Landrum and her grandson Colby are exposed to radiation coming from a UFO which was pursued by military helicopters which is near Dayton, Texas. These two incidents, though happened about 5,000 miles from each other, both were near Air Force bases and left traces of radiation. Could there be a correlation?

20090305004325AA30L63	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	Is there any way to determine the traits of baby guinea pigs before birth?	What I mean is, if you have a female guinea pig that's a Crested Cavy, and the father is an Abessinian Cavy, is there anyway to know what the babies will or are more likely to look like. Do baby guinea pigs generally look like the mother or the father (whether same type or not)? Or is it like human babies (no sure way of knowing). Is it even possible for different types of guinea pigs to breed, or is that some kind of impossible cross-breeding?            P.S., I am not an animal breeder, NOR AM I interested in becoming a breeder, I am just wondering. I have a female guinea pig (crested) with a very "different" color pattern...one that I've never seen before, and am just interested in their traits and how breeding may influence this.

Here's what I have      original:  ∫((x^2+2x)/((x^2+1)^2)dx      --------------------------------------...      ((Ax+B)/(x^2+1))+((Cx+D)/(x^2+1)^2)      x^2+2x = (Ax+B)(x^2+1)(Cx+D)      x^2+2x = Ax^3 + Ax + Bx^2 + B + Cx + D      x^2 + 2x = Ax^3 + Bx^2 + (A+C)x + B + D      0 = A   1 = B   2 = A+ C   0 = B + D      solving for cof's      A = 0   B = 1   C = 2   D = -1      which gives a decomposition of      (1/(x^2+1)) + (2x-1)/(x^2+1)^2)      ∫(1/(x^2+1)) = arctan(x)       arctan(x) + ∫((2x-1)/(x^2+1)^2)      I know I have to find the integral of the second part...do I have to do integration by partial fractions again?

I am 41 years old and want to finally get a job I enjoy, so I would like to hear from preferably qualified people and get some advice about this kind of work. I don't know much about the field other than it is one of the few things I feel strongly that I have a talent and desire to do.      I'm  a bit of a  failure in the computing field because my heart just isn't in it. I started it for money now feel like it has trapped me there because I'd have to start at the bottom level again with a new career. I am prepared to do this now. I dont want to die wondering.      All my life I constantly find my self looking at objects of all types and admiring or analysing the way they have been made, how they achieve the job they were intended to perform for the given price bracket they were intended.   If I see an item that doesn't do the job very well I find myself daydreaming about how I could improve it or make a better one from scratch.   I see day to day problems that could so easily be made easier by an invention of some sort. I find myself building this machine in my mind, honing it, perfecting it.   I find it difficult to turn these thoughts off sometime but actually I dont want to. I love it.       So.. After all that preamble, my question is.. At the age of 41, not overly good at maths but able to turn my hand to it if I had to, What is the best job/way to satisfy this urge and the quickest route to working in this kind of field that I could take.      I dont know much about what person performs the functions I mentioned, is it the Engineer? or designer? or Steve Jobs / Dean Kamen type that might dictate his idea and pass it to other people to actually implement their inspired ideas into reality??      I am not so interested in the actual implementing side, I like the idea's/researching their validity/efficiency/practicality/ease of use / fit for purpose etc etc. I also see them in great detail but would prefer to be the one who passes this concept to others to map out in technical form.      What job is this? does it exist? do I need loads of qualifications/degrees etc?/ what is some short courses/quals that might help me get a foot on the ladder or get attention..      Ideally I would like to work on projects and not just a 9-5 type job. I dont mind doing long hours but flexibility is important to me more than reliable hours.      I dont want to go and do another 4 year degree but am quite happy to study part time on a permananent basis.            Thank you so much for your help.        P.S. If you are familiar with the Myers-Briggs personality types, I am an INTP.  From what I have read this makes me a suitable type of personality to do this kind of work. INTP's are good at producing/working with ideas in their heads, but dont get the satisfaction from actually implementing the ideas if they can be proven to work in our heads..      I have spent 4 years of my life studying computers and I don't wish to continue working with computers (in purely IT roles at least) but do realise some of those skills are usefull in other fields such as this kind of field.    I want to be primarily designing stuff though, not supporting the computers of those who do.

20090305032523AA95kTB	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	Going off antidepressant?	I really, really, want to go off it. I've gained weight, I sleep to much, and I don't want to take it when I have a kid, which might be soon. I've gone off it for a couple days at a time and I'm a complete wreck. Bawling my eyes out and wanting to just curl up in bed for days. I hate being so dependent on anti's. I went on Cymbalta when I was 14 for 2 years, and it helped the depression, soreness, and panic attacks, but it eventually started to wear off and only helped the pain. So I switched to Zoloft for another 2, which made me do all the stuff I stated above. I want to go cold turkey but Idk if I should. I'm mainly worried about the panic attacks, pushing my fiance away, and avoiding self harm. Does anyone have any tips on how to go about quiting?

20090305033220AAY1g87	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	A few science questions?	Hi guys, got a few sci questions which i know the answer and am not really sure of, so here i am checking with some of you all :D      The conversion of energy for:   1) Using a water heater   2) Using a toaster   3) Plucking strings of a guitar   4) Displaying of fireworks      And this is the tough one!!   The term 'wasted energy' refers to energy that is not useful in production of that energy. For example, chemical potential energy is converted into kinetic energy of vehicles but unavoidably produces unwanted heat, sound and light energy inside engine. How do you measure efficiency of energy conversion process? Give 1 example to illustrate the concept of efficiency!      Omg :(
