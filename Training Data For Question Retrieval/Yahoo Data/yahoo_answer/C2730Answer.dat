oeki94Azaa	When my dog was pregnant, she lost more weight than she gained in the first month and a half.  My vet told me she was fine, but if you can feel her spine and hip bones...it's obvious she's NOT as fine as she could be.  I got a second opinion and a new vet!  Try mixing her puppy chow with a 1 cup of cooked barley.  My dog was a lot healthier by the end of her pregnancy and so were her pups.  Hope this helps.|`|7F9Mzhn0aa	If the vet said she was fine, then don't worry too much about it.  You don't want her to become overweight.  If you're really concerned about her weight, you can feed her some table scraps to help her while she is nursing the pups.|`|LcdaUleUaa	Does she look thinner than the last time you were at the vet?  If not, then don't worry about it and continue on with what you've been doing.  <br>  <br>  If she has lost weight, then you need to call up the vet for advice.  They'll tell you if it can be easily solved on your own or if it is important enough to bring her in.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i would suggest investing in a good daily multi vitamin. i give all my dogs one. along with that feed it dyne either by itself or in food. dyne is a high calorie supplement that will help to add weight on the dog. some dogs like the taste of it but some don't. i had to feed my yorkie dyne because even though he was in great health he was still underweight.<br>  <br>  also it depends on what you're feeding it. holistic brand dog foods are best but most suggest feeding pregnant dogs twice as much as you usually feed them.

That is a scam, and a common one at that. Anything from Cameroon, Nigeria, or prices that are too good to be true with sob stories are scams.

They will run with the money they got and move onto the next person, or they will try to get you for more. They will say something along the lines of "Problems with the airline. They need more money to ship the dog. So it's going to be another 300 dollars." You send that, and they are gone, unless they have the balls to come back and ask for more.

qPPBcWoDaa	Male dogs do not always lift their leg to pee - some never do.  My German Shepherd never lifted his leg.  I currently have a male Australian Shepherd and a male Irish Setter - the Aussie is the older of the two and he does not lift his leg - my Setter does.<br>  <br>  Lifting a leg to pee is not just a male dog trait.  I actually have a female Cairn terrier that lifts her left and she did not learn it from a male dog - she was doing it before I had my males.|`|lNyI0FSCaa	It's normal for a male to -never- lift his leg in fact.  Our own dog didn't lift his leg until he was a little over a year old and he saw another male dog do it.  Poor boy had to be hanging out with the girls the rest of the time!|`|2SgsPKF9aa	I had a collie for 13 years and he never lifted his leg to pee once in his life. It is normal. Nothing to worry about.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Your dog is still very young, give him a chance to mature(akitas don't mature mentally until at least 2).

y0cbLn0Yaa	No, but I think that you should have to prove yourself worthy to be bred from - financially secure, willing to care for the children and not leave them for hours on end in long daycare, assume the responsibility of ensuring they have as good an education as is possible, be able to set a good example by having good morals and work ethics - to name a few things.<br>  <br>  I also don't think it helps that the government is paying for bevans and losers to be out there popping out kids who are just going to end up "in the system", all for a new plasma or playstation.  There is something so wrong in that if you ask me.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Trouble is that the people who don't breed are probably the ones that should!!<br>  <br>  Most of the kids in orphanages are in there because of war or poverty - all caused by humans - not necessarily from overpopulation.  As much as what you are suggesting sounds like 'common sense' at first thought, it is too much like eugenics or selective (non)breeding to be fair or even possible.  Who decides??|`|1bRRODd2aa	I'd definitely be in favour.<br>  <br>  The problem in the world today, is that the people least suitable to have children have loads, the people most suitable, either have none or very few.<br>  <br>  I don't believe anyone should even contemplate having a child/children if they cannot afford to raise them until the age of 18 at the very minimum.  No one has the right to expect the state to pay for their kids, and certainly not have them with the expectation that the state will pay up.<br>  <br>  I believe everyone should be taught parenting skills from about the age of 13 at school, and have it drummed into them what the responsibilities of having children entail and require of them.<br>  <br>  Raising a child is about the hardest, and most responsible thing anyone has to do, and almost everyone stumbles into parenthood, totally unprepared and untrained, and often alone.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Its called to the job right is complete hysterectomy for women,  just getting your tubes tied, you can that reversed, but not the hysterectomy, its pover and done no more kiddies at all..<br>  <br>  and yes if the goverment is gonna regulate good reputable breeders, why not regulate everyone for kids, like the people that have 10-15 kids and only live on welfare and food stamps..put them out to work, and stop having kids....|`|PxJXJKCpaa	I'm fixed by Mother Nature.  I pulled the China rule and only had one.  Roe V Wade rocks.  It should never be gone from our system.  Since doctors won't fix a young person, it's the only way out.<br>  <br>  Some people just have accidents and as long as abortions are legal (maybe not moral) they should be able to get them.  It does keep our population down a bit.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i actually made a t-shirt for my graphic design class with this concept. 2 teens are sitting on a couch making out and a dog is peeking around the couch with a thought bubble saying "why am i the only one neutered?"|`|hCuYxZkVaa	People do get spayed and neutered its called getting your tubes tied or getting a vasectomy.  The reason there are so many unwanted children is because these children came from parents who could not afford to have these procedures done.  There is no way people in third world countries, where most of the overpopulation and children is orphanages exist, have these options available to them.|`|EHF8yYwCaa	My gut reaction to this is "Absolutely".  You've got to have a license to catch a fish, drive a car or build a house....yet any idiot with a working reproductive system can reproduce and be responsible for an entire human being's life, without having to prove themselves in ANY way. <br>  <br>  However, while in "theory" it sounds like a great idea, in practice it sets in place an almost frightening level of governmental control on the reproductive rights of humans.  I'm not in favor of the government making ANY decisions regarding what we can, or cannot do with our bodies...be it anti-abortion legislation, or mandatory sterilization for "undesirable" people.  <br>  <br>  I *do* think it'd be a good idea if it was easier for folks who don't want kids, or who know they can't handle kids.... to CHOOSE sterilization.  Many folks don't want kids & would be happy to have the operation done, but at least in the US most doctors will REFUSE to perform a tubal or vasectomy unless you are married and have already had children (I know, I've tried).   I was even unable to find a doctor who would insert an IUD because there's a .000001% chance of an infection that could cause sterility....I said, "Good.  Icing on the cake!" and the doctor still refused.  I have to go to Planned Parenthood to get one.  <br>  <br>  I'd also be in favor of some sort of system that taxed parents more heavily unless they spent a certain amount of time in parenting classes or obtained "parenting licenses" that proved their ability to parent a child responsibly.  That way there's nobody "controlling" your basic reproductive rights, but it does provide an incentive for folks to be smart about it.  <br>  <br>  Either way, I don't think the comparison is accurate, to compare 1000's of kids in orphanages to the MILLIONS of animals in shelters.<br>  <br>  For the main reason that when nobody adopts the KIDS within 7 days, nobody is EUTHANIZING them!!   Childless couples wanting to adopt will wait for years and pay upwards of $15,000 for a healthy baby.  Nobody is killing orphans due to lack of homes.  I DO get what you're saying, but the comparison between unwanted pets & kids really isn't there, IMO.  <br>  <br>  ADD:  To clarify, I'm also not in favor of mandatory spay/neuter for all dogs & cats.  I do think there is such a thing as "responsible breeding".  Unfortunately, most folks who breed don't fit into that category.  <br>  <br>  But mandatory spay/neuter would only serve to punish the law abiding, more responsible folks who license their animals.  Folks with strays and mutts and unlicensed dogs would still breed litters (whether purposeful or accidental) and would be more hesitant to seek necessary vet care for fear of being found out & subjected to fines.|`|4AoGScP0aa	YES! They absolutely should. If people cannot afford to provide for their children, then maybe....they should stop reproducing. What a concept! But an extra kid means a bigger check to some people. States need to pass laws that enforce mandatory tube tying and/or vasectomies for people who abuse the welfare system, as well as junkies who give birth to babies already addicted to the mother's drug of choice.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	No, only peta, hsus, and ar-istas! Stupid people shouldn't breed! LOL<br>  Good point, and one I have thought about bringing up. Something like, don't give birth till all orphans have homes! Kind of ridiculous when you put it that way. Makes about as much Sense as "fixing" every single dog, both species would die out!|`|pLA8dhkdaa	Oh man, I could not agree more.

gcdMCAfqaa	The "native" breed of dog in Australia is a dingo, which cannot bark, only howl.<br>  <br>  My dog is boxer cross dingo, and while she can bark on occasion, she prefers to howl.<br>  <br>  When she is happy she does this funny howl/growl that comes from deep inside her chest. It does freak some people out at first, but then they think its cute.<br>  <br>  Anyone who understands dog psychology will understand that you can pick up on aggressive behaviour long before a dog "growls". |`|ZmFa6FL2aa	Some doggies are real talkers, we call one cocker spaniel at our shelter a talker spaniel, ha! Our trainer told us that we might not like it when a dog growls at us for any reason but its really good information cause the dog is letting you know what it is thinking about so we're not suppose to punish the dogs for growling cause maybe the dog is saying i'm afraid please don't come closer and now you know to be careful around them. We feed them treats when they growl if they're scared or stressed out and this makes them feel better and sometimes they stop growling and are happy to see us.|`|sBQvubj5aa	I have two rodesian ridgeback/pitbull/staffy/sumthing else crosses and often people are scared of them.

However, my dog doesn't growl when he is touched - if that happens, that is a clear sign of aggression. Sometimes dogs growl when they play, which is what they may do with other dogs and what I consider to be different from a..."Get out of my face"...type of growl.<br>  People are still scared of his playful growl because they don't know the difference and think any growl means that the dog wants to attack. <br>  <br>  He wags his tail when growling playfully, so if people get scared I just say..."Look, his tail is wagging...he's only playing!".|`|CyO03B9Caa	no, it doesn't worry me.<br>  <br>  I spent about 4 years in the Himalayas living among a small pack of dogs that some local monks had brought in. after about year 3 i began to understand their body language, and slowly i understood their actual language. Being able to understand my dog this way has really opened up a lot of doors of communication, and now i longer see growling as just an intimidation technique because i understand what they're actually saying. what my dog says ranges anywhere from "I SMELL BACON!" to<br>  "I SERIOUSLY THINK 24 IS THE BEST SHOW, EVER."<br>  <br>  hope that helps!|`|LfjiNGqbaa	my english bull always makes sounds like that and she's the most soppy dog i have ever known,people are scared all the time by her .i just think that there the ones missing out so we have fun anyway.|`|AA11304894	My dogs growl in their sleep and have a great smile which some inexperienced, around dogs, people think is a snarl.<br>  <br>  Anybody who knows dogs can tell the difference between a contented and an aggressive growl.|`|rMulUAqBaa	ya i encountered same experience as kyle but im not worried just because ive never encountered a dog. hope that helps
jyVCzVlDaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Try these tips:<br>  <br>  1. Take rest stops. You know your pet best--learn his signs of motion sickness and stop accordingly. Some dogs travel fine for hours; others need to stop frequently.<br>  <br>  2. Open the window enough so your dog can take in some fresh air, but not so much that he can jump or fall out of the window.<br>  <br>  3. Letting your dog ride up front can help, since there's less movement. Be sure he's strapped in with a dog safety belt. Some travel kennels also buckle in.<br>  <br>  Check out this informative articles about car sickness:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/keep-dog-getting-car-sick-ohora-faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/keep-dog-getting-car-...</a><br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/car-sickness.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/car-sickness.html</a>

Dogs do not shed because it's hot out, nor because they are hot.  Dogs shed out their coats twice a year.  In the spring, they lose their heavy winter coat to grow in a summer coat.

Then they will shed that when it warms up and replace it again with the lighter summer coat again. <br>  <br>  My dogs shed worse after winter, they generally have more hair to lose!|`|3ULQIRH9aa	same with my american bulldog, i'm pretty sure its nothing to worry about. i think its just that these breeds get seasonal coats and just lose the hair a little slower so it seems like not stop shedding but at the same time they're growing the coat. im sorry if this is a little confusing.|`|a72cc9094600797a6084b6d93880dde6aa	Certain breeds blow their coats twice a year.  When the weather gets colder they shed their 'summer coats' for a heavier coat.  Vice versa when it gets warm.  It's not backward at all.  Just the way nature intended it.  :)|`|dZiPdsRyaa	Now that's it's colder, yes, she has.  Especially when you pet or scratch her.  I don't necessarily mind, but my Dad hates it.  Oh well, he'll have to live because our vacuum is broken! lol|`|Um8osMNuaa	They seem to go a couple of months without shedding, but when Amy stops, Milly starts, so l never seem to get a gap with no shedding, l just have a change from yellow hairs everywhere to chocolate hairs.<br>  l find they tend to shed more during the winter months because the central heating comes on, so their body seems to think it's summer so it's time to shed.<br>  So l end up spending a lot of time brush them and vacuuming the house, as they say a woman's work is never done, especially if you've got dogs, although that applies if you've got kids and an hubby as well, l don't know who makes the most mess!|`|eDySIDPQaa	Bo, my Newfie is blowing off now...and his new coat is under it....<br>  <br>  he does not shed much at all in summer, keep him brushed and combed.<br>  <br>  My Akita's, Koda and Kiko, shed very little........<br>  <br>  
veDvtYhJaa	Small dogs tend to be somewhat more nervous because of their size.  A papillon can be a good dog with children if you are a good Pack Leader and you train both the dog and the child how to treat each other right.<br>  <br>  But you should not depend on us and our answers totally.  Before you buy a papillon, you need to learn ALL you can about the breed, to make sure it fits with your life style and activity level.  You should google:  papillon breed traits and read a bunch of the websites that will come up as they will tell you about the breed and help you learn what the dog is like. -!-|`|lmSffrNuaa	Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child's hands and injure himself if he's not being held correctly, and he won't hesitate to defend himself if he's being mistreated. Many breeders won't sell puppies to families with toddlers for fear that the dog will be injured.<br>  <br>  Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Papillon if they're sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.<br>  <br>  Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/papillon/children-and-other-pets" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/papillon/c...</a><br>  <br>  Hope it helps!<br>  |`|CkYTyGkTaa	Papillons are usually only best with older considerate children but every dog breed can be trained to love children. The temperament of a Papillon is hardy; some people find that their Papillon is very capable of handling a good five-mile walk. One aspect of the Papillon that has led many to believe the "big dog" assertion is this breeds surprising athletic ability. Perhaps people are surprised that in contrast to its staid and stately representation in the Old Master portraits, the Papillon is highly energetic and intelligent (Stanley Coren, in The Intelligence of Dogs, rates the Papillon eighth among all breeds). This makes Papillons very easy to train as they are so quick to learn. Provided their genetic structure is sound and they are healthy, Papillons are built for movement, and most do not need any encouragement to apply their energy to athletic activities. Papillons are easily litter box trained, making them the perfect apartment companion. Like any other breed, an owner must be very attentive in order to house train the Papillon.<br>  <br>  Well Good Luck and i hope this helps!! :)|`|KaQLLLXfaa	All breeds are good with children and they are very protective on the children.Best wishes|`|6dXbWGQAaa	any breed is good with children if they are trained correctly.|`|e5izRIYxaa	alll dogs are|`|ptl6QAzZaa	Firstly its Papillons *<br>  coming from the french word butterfly, as their ears resemble a butterfly's ears.<br>  it would all depend on the dog, if you getting a rescued papillon its more risky as you never know how there previous owners behaved with them, <br>  i have 3 papillons and they were all very scatty as such when i first got them, since then 2 of them have become used to us and the other 1 runs away still when you reach out to him, i know they had a rough past with their previous owners, <br>  but will pets its not so much that they don't get on with children its more how to children act such as sudden movements that can scare the dog away, <br>  one of my papillons had its teeth kicked out which makes him very cautious when i go near his mouth and another one of them used to get swung around by his ears by a child so he isn't so keen to be around them, <br>  i find papillons are willing to play with young children you just have to keep in mind previous traumatic experiences they may of had, <br>  |`|2c126e57d6d174fbf2ab1aa3c58465a2aa	Papillons are great with kids as i have two (i am a papillon breeder) and they love everyone.Papillons are people dogs and love to be sat on someones knee,they would be perfect little dogs for children when full grown but a little care is needed  when they are puppies as they can easily be trodden on.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i assume you mean papillons. if you mean the small butterfly eared dogs. they are good with children but can't really deal with a lot of rough housing. teach your child how to properly hold a dog and play with it and there should be no problems|`|DMX0tSDGaa	They are usually good with teen aged children. Younger children may be too rough for them and hurt them. Danger of injury is to the dog not the child. 
K8t1lPXsaa	it is recommended that the dog get a yearly booster once they are an adult. also check how long the rabies vaccine last. some rabies shots are only for a year others are for three years|`|9kTejB0uaa	Lots of new thinking about the need for yearly boostering and some suggest this is actually harmful.  However, if you are going to be using boarding kennels, they do require up to date boosters (within the current year).   Obviously rabies boostering is dependant on the local laws for where you are.  Personally I gave my puppies their full vaccination course, then boostered at around 18 months.  After that, depending on whether the pup was being shown, bred from etc.etc. during his/her life, would dictate what boosters were done, and how often.   <br>  <br>  Suggest you take your vet's advice as to what specifically needs boostering (eg. parvo sometimes crops up regionally and your dog will need protection).|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	yes she needs boosters for every year you have her |`|IcYXQlf9aa	You dog should see a vet at least yearly for a check up and heartworm  and fecal tests (and I do complete blood work every year , too). Vaccinations are another issue- at the most, boosters should be given every 3 years, but most dogs don't even need that, except for Rabies as required by law. I'd urge you to do some research about vaccines- you can start here:<br>  www.homevet.com|`|A9qDWpXUaa	Here in the UK you would have your regular boosters (or part of - DHPPI/L) and bordatella every 12mths. If you vaccinate for rabies for a pet passport that is every 3 yrs but the best people to speak to are your local vets in order to get the correct information for your area.
K8t1lPXsaa	most dogs get excited about getting to go outside. instead of taking the leash off as soon as you get in wait a while. let it relax and lay down and calmly take it off. you can do the same before going out. you don't have to go out immediately after putting the leash on. also if you speak to your dog in an excited manner that also contributes. it's always better to say nothing until they calm down|`|zcL0BOJiaa	your pet is just so excited he can't control his bladder most dogs out grow this in time some never do, its just that he is so happy, and full of excitement

2a6f5d805ecd07579b35f24fb39ece2eaa	What a lucky dog and her pups!  It's best to wait until after the pups have been weaned and a few weeks after.  You definately want to take mom and pups into see a vet as soon as possible for a post natal check over.  At that time you can ask your vet when they want to spay mom.  <br>  <br>  As for the pups ask them if they will spay and neuter them that young.  Often vets want to wait until they are at least 4 months old before putting them under for surgery.  But that would be up to you and your vet.  <br>  <br>  You might want to prescreen potential adopters.  Alternates to having them spayed and neutered before adopting them out are to have the adopter prepay at a vet for the spay and neuter as part of their adoption fee.  Also have them sign a spay and neuter contract, stating that they must have the dog spayed or neutered before 6 months of age.  Keep in contact and make sure they follow through with their end of the contract.<br>  <br>  Good for you and good for this dog for finding a great new home!|`|K8t1lPXsaa	you can spay her as soon as the pups are weened. most have no problems neutering males before they go to their new homes but most usually want females to be older. you could always hold the females back a little longer or consult with whoever will do the procedure first|`|uSdmh2d7aa	GOOD FOR YOU!!!!! talk to your vet about the mother, but the pups can be spayed by 12 weeks or earlier...I'm glad to see some one want to spay their dog!|`|ITnQEUQTaa	When the pups are weaned - she won't come into heat again for about 4 months after whelping so there is plenty of time.  <br>  <br>  There is a great deal of argument about when to de-sex pups.  I personally think that an animal should have reached sexual maturity and full growth before this is done but many shelters and/or breeders de-sex puppies.  Talk to your vet about this one.<br>  <br>  Have fun and well done!!|`|Bw18seFqaa	the mom can be spayed as soon as the pups are weaned at 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Pups can be spayed and neutered as early as 8 weeks if they are at least 2 pounds..  you will have to find a vet that is willing to do a pediatric spay/neuter tho.. some vets dont like to speuter until closer to 6 months of age.
AA11585182	A pit bull, even one bred for fighting, will get along with other dogs provided that it has been properly trained and socialized, and that it is not encouraged to fight.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like the pit bull in question has met that criteria, since it gets along with the other dogs.<br>  <br>  But they are both still puppies.<br>  <br>  Pit bulls don't come out of the womb wanting to fight other dogs.  Most puppies will get along fine with other puppies.  Most pit bulls will get along with dogs they've been raised with.  3 months old means nothing.  Dogs are still puppies until they are two years old.  They will steadily grow into their temperment until about that age.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, it depends on the dog itself, and how it has been raised.  Pit bulls, in general, tend to be aggressive with other dogs.  I have owned pit bulls since 1991, and I have had some that wouldn't fight back even if the poodle jumped off its porch and attacked it; and I have had others that couldn't be trusted around other dogs no matter how hard I tried to socialize them.  Most pit bulls fall into the middle.<br>  <br>  The Golden Rule with pit bulls is, NEVER leave a pit bull alone and unsupervised with another pit bull, or with another dominant dog of any breed.<br>  (It isn't JUST pit bulls that are aggressive with other dogs, you know.)<br>  <br>  At the age your dogs are now, any fight they get into is HIGHLY unlikely to be serious, and even if it is you shouldn't have too much trouble breaking them up.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry much about it until they are both about 1 1/2 or 2 years old.  Even then, I wouldn't worry much since your dog and the others are not pit bulls.<br>  <br>  I have a two year old female pit bull that I've aised since she was 8 weeks old.  My friend moved into a spare room of mine and brought his 9 month old German Shepherd.  When we ffirst introduced them, my female put her on the ground and growled a lot, and even mouthed her, but never bit down hard.  My friend's GSD never got hurt.  My dog wasn't trying to hurt her.  She just wanted the GSD to know that she was going to be the boss.  My friend's dog submitted, and now they get along fine.<br>  <br>  I don't fight my dogs, and I discourage it when they act aggressive with other dogs.  That is the key.  Another key is realizing that certain actions one may do to discourage a dog from acting aggressive actually encourages it.  Most dog owners do the exact wrong thing.  One episode of the Dog Whisperer is enough to give you several examples of that.<br>  <br>  But here is the thing...<br>  Someday, that GSD (German Shepherd Dog) is going to grow up, and she may not want to submit to her authority anymore.  When that day comes, they will fight, and it will be for real.  With a non pit bull, it will usually submit again after a few minutes, the pit bull who wins will stop hurting it, and they will go back to being friends, as long as there is no more challenge to the authority.  If you are talking about two pit bulls, the fight may last for a while, and both dogs could seriously hurt each other.<br>  <br>  You aren't likely to have to worry about that.  The breed you have is not normally very dominant with other dogs, but again, individual dogs of whatever breed can have totally different personalities than what is standard for their breed.  Your dog, upon maturity, could be more aggressive and dominant than the pit bull.  You won't know until your dog is mature, and at 3 months, it is impossible to tell.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, you have to go by how your dog behaves, how the other dogs behave, and how well each of you are able to control them.<br>  <br>  Without knowing each of those factors, it is totally impossible for anyone, including me, to be able to predict how things are going to work out with them.<br>  <br>  At 3 months of age, I can safely say that you needn't worry.  They may growl and wrestle a bit to establish who is going to be dominant, and after that is settled, they will play.<br>  <br>  If you are good at understanding dog behavior and psychology, they won't fight at all, because you, being the "alpha" will not allow it.  But when you aren't around, it may be different.  Now that they are puppies, it's no big deal.  When they are both 2 or 3 years old, it could be a different matter.<br>  <br>  Last, it is highly unusual, even for a pit bull, to find an adult dog that will hurt a puppy.<br>  <br>  You can send me a message if you need more info or have other questions.<br>  <br>  El Chistoso|`|NlvghuIkaa	Introduce them proper and slowly. Let them sniff, greet and anything else a dog needs to do. Because they are both puppies they will want to play, there will be no dominance problems and as the two grow up together, they will become best friends. |`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Make sure they get a proper introduction, I know this sounds strange but find something that they have in common such as a favourite treat, give them one each, then give them both the same of everything they like, make sure you watch them for the first time they meet, given time, they might come to like eachother.|`|CexCRxjraa	Dogs can be gathered and live together without worry of fight, if they all live from puppy. But for more secure, since your friend's dogs are large while yours are still puppy, you better put your rottweiler puppy separate from them.  |`|GFwCm69Jaa	Dogs respond to the way humans respond. If you guys are all worried about whether the dogs will get along the dogs will feel that and it will make them nervous. I moved in with my friend who had a pit bull and I had just gotten my boxer/pit mix pup. I brought her blanket over a few times for the pit bull to get used to her scent. When I brought my pup over they sniffed around and the adult female played very gently with the pup. Many dogs will realize that she is just a baby and will play .. but very lightly. I would try and bring a blanket or shirt or something with their scent on it to introduce them first. |`|K8t1lPXsaa	since the dog is a puppy there shouldn't be many problems. most well balanced dogs will readily accept a puppy. and puppies raised together bond closely. make sure you supervise them for about a week or so before leaving them completely alone though. <br>  <br>  i had my rottie shepherd mix and then when he was close to 2 years i got my pit. no problems what so ever. it's not the breed it's the individual dog's social skills. |`|dkpaiZcTaa	Yes, we have a female APBT (4 yrs. old) and a male Rottweiler (1 yr. old) and they are wonderful together!  <br>  As long as they're both well trained and have been properly socialized (and introduced), it doesn't matter what breeds they are, they should get along fine! :)|`|XOtKkIpxaa	male will get along with female straight away will take time for male on male puppy will be fine they will get their pecking order together|`|eAHKGI6Zaa	as long as you control all the dogs on the first few introductions......some dogs become very protective of their owners|`|hQUe3o6Raa	I'd be worried about the adult females first and foremost, far more than the puppy.

The whole situation sounds like a recipe for disaster, unless you're all extremely vigilant about maintaining order.|`|layEITfcaa	As long as your don't applaud fighting and teach them to be peaceful, they should be okay in the house. What you should do, before you move in. Have the two dogs meet in a neutral place, like a park or something. Do this several times before you move in. In fact you really should have a group meet with all your dogs and all their dogs to make sure no fights break out.|`|vJCFfJmHaa	As long as ya'll set some boundaries and don’t let them run around like wild banshees you should be fine. And I hope the females are spayed.|`|whQ282QTaa	they should be fine. they will both still be somewhat puppies when you move in. just watch them really close and any little thing that suggests fighting stop them and punish both of them. maybe like putting them in a crate or something. usually pitties and rotties do good together. its just getting pitties and pitties together that can sometimes trigger bad fighting
jU3HWCUBaa	Hi - when my puppies were small I gave them weetbix with warm water, natural yoghurt and honey. You must make sure the water is cool enough before it eats.  You don't want to burn the dogs mouth.  Also dried dog food with warm water and a little raw mince.  Watch you don't give the pup too much.  Mine were labradors. You can also buy cheap cans of sardines - I get the ones for 55cents a can; also raw eggs - twice a week. They will eat the shell and all.  You might have to break the egg a little at first, but they soon learn quickly to break it. Sardines and eggs are really good for the dogs coat. Feed him 3 times a day up to 6 months old and reduce to 2 times up till the pup is a year old then reduce to 1 feed a day.  Make sure you provide lots of fresh water. |`|m3ThrbDMaa	Go with some Primo puppy food they sell at Pet Stores only...<br>  <br>  Or even what the vet sells...<br>  <br>  Don't feed it cheap stuff...|`|kay9DFbdaa	you can buy special puppy food.<br>  also people say not to give dogs human food, but i got my rottweiller cross german sheppard when he was a pup, and he always ate anything we ate. he lived the life expectancy of those dogs so i dont know|`|K8t1lPXsaa	holistic is always best. i personally feed my dogs innova. it has food from all the food groups, providing great nutrition. when you buy food make sure that the first ingredient is some type of meat-chicken, beef, etc. avoid anything that that has a bunch of different colors or says it contains by products. this is just fillers and dyes. it's basically feeding your dog saw dust. also stay away from wheat, it causes skin irritations and allergies for the dog. avoid the commercial dog food you can find in a grocery store. science diet, bill jack, beneful, etc. these foods are all ranked F for nutrition.|`|AcvSost8aa	We are feeding our Ovcharka pup the grain people make slop for pigs from.

NX23JRGEaa	    Depends on your vet and area. Dogs only need their shots including rabies every three yrs now after they are 1 yr old. If you buy reg heartworm preventative then a yearly test is needed for the Federal Regs. An exam can run $15-$60 depending on vet and a heartworm test runs $15-$25. Neutering can run from $150-$300 and you can buy flea stuff cheaper from online places such as K V Vet. Heartworm meds from a vet cost more then from an online place as well. I use Ivomec for my 7 dogs and it runs me $36 for 3 yrs. A well bred,  neutered dog fed top food that has a great temperament, lots of exercise and is well socialized is less sickly then a poorly bred dog with a nervous temperament. Mostly white dogs such as Boxers and ABs have terrible allergy problems so mucho $$ there. |`|scNgYAW7aa	I have my dogs on a Wellness plan and it covers all their shots and test and gives me a discount on things it does not cover.

gbNwqlZNaa	BYB are people who do not care what breed, as long as the puppies are cute, tend to use the dogs (in vogue-such as now with smaller breeds).. they do not health test, they often cross breed, they do not show, do not care about the adults conformation, as long as the puppies are cute and can sell them for a larger amount of money.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, there are reg breeders who are the same, they do not show thier dogs yet because they are registered, people assume they are decent breeders.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Accidental or not, designed or not, if you do not health test, you are liable for any and all vet bills needed for those puppies for thier life. <br>  <br>  If you do not breed to better the breed, why do you do it? <br>  <br>  Im a reg breeder and i do not make money, in most cases i loose, high cost of health testing, with a average litter size of 2.  I breed my females only once a year, ive seen back yard breeders sell a litter every 6 months, until the female either dies in whelp, or until its too old to fall pregnant, what kind of life is that for a dog?|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	You know I have been thinking about this a lot lately.  IMO a backyard breeder really is someone who really doesn't know, or stop to think about, what they are doing.  They are not bad people, just not well educated when it comes to dogs.  They probably bought their dog from a backyard breeder and aren't aware of any of the genetic conditions which can inflict dogs.<br>  <br>  I think that their dogs could be registered with the reputable national registry and so they naively believe that what they are doing is more than acceptable.  They aren't breeding cross breeds.<br>  <br>  I don't think they are necessarily breeding their dogs to make a profit.  In many cases they are probably just getting back the cost of their dog, again naively believing they are doing nothing wrong or detrimental to dog-kind.<br>  <br>  I say this because my 1st 3 dogs were bought from backyard breeders.  I knew no better at the time.  I just wanted a purebred Border Collie and the papers were a bonus.  I then bought a female, and probably if they had lived long enough I would have naively and innocently bred them.  Not because I didn't care but because I didn't know.<br>  <br>  My 3rd dog, another from a backyard breeder, Belgian Shepherd Groenendael actually was a fantastic dog.  He was an Australian Champion, multi in group winner, reserve in show and had obedience titles.<br>  <br>  It wasn't until I bought dog No. 4, a Belgian Shepherd Groenendael female, that we actually did some research looking to get a female with good show potential and met Gypsy's breeders who taught us so much.  We fell into showing the male and learnt what those registration pedigree papers really mean.<br>  <br>  We were going to breed the female, but not with our existing male as, despite his titles and wins, we were far more knowledgable and could recognise his faults and realised that he wasn't the best choice to improve the breed.<br>  <br>  It is about now that we became aware of genetic testing in dogs and I learnt that, through research on the Internet - now possible, my female Border Collie more than likely had Ceroid Lipofuscinosis .<br>  <br>  Dog No. 5 came from a reputable breeder in Canberra - though we were only after a pet we now knew the pitfalls.<br>  <br>  Dog No. 6, also only wanted a pet quality but to do obedience / agility / watch dog, came from a reputable breeder.  We ended up with the pick of the litter, not by choice.  We may or may not show him.  I got a bit jaded with the bit*chiness and artificiality of dog showing years ago.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I think that you shouldn't slam most BYBs, but try to educate them.  There is an old saying that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar.<br>  <br>  By the way, I never did breed my Groenendael bit*ch as she came into season at the wrong time to use the chosen mate.  Can't say I am unhappy about that really.|`|9kTejB0uaa	Simple answer - a BYB is somebody who is breeding dogs (ie churning them out) primarily for money, not for the improvement of their bloodline and their breed!!   One step back from a full-on Puppy Farm so possibly not involving multiple breeds.|`|cRN6TRVPaa	Theres plenty of good animals needing homes through ACCIDENTAL breeding, and of course in shelters, so in that respect, they are lessening each animals chance of getting a good new home. <br>  <br>  If they treat their animals well, (not that many do), then fair enough. <br>  But if they don't (as is the norm), then they are scum, exploiting animals to make a quick buck. <br>  Especially if they don't even bother getting whatever they are breeding vetted before selling, because this can cause so much pain for the new owners, if the animal is sick or even dies.<br>  <br>  However, some vets say to let your dog hae one litter of puppies before you neuter it, so, if you happen to have a dog with a really nice temperment or something, then i think the ONE litter is ok. <br>  We didnt let our dog have any pups before spaying her because she is deaf, and does'nt have the best personaltiy haha. <br>  <br>  But yer..

YnWwcUPTaa	Fleas do bite and carry disease.  Bubonic Plague was caused by fleas.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure  if there is a bomb for fleas.  I would remove all bedding including the dogs and thoroughly wash everything in hot water if you can, put a flea & tick collar in your vacuum bag and thoroughly vacuum all furniture carpets floor, cracks and crevices matress both sides then spread lightly with a duster everything with diatomaceous earth (food grade) also your yard. leave it in your house for awhile and then vacuum again dispose your first vac bag immediately and use a fresh one if you like you could put the earth in the fresh bag maybe a tbs worth and again dispose of the bag,  Other than that I don't know what to tell you maybe hire an exterminator.|`|ebuxHnScaa	First, learn a valuable lesson -- you have to keep your pets free of fleas.

These are cans of pesticide.  You leave the house (with your pets) while the cans of spray release their contents.  Don't come back for a couple of hours.

Make sure you scrub your pet(s) THOROUGHLY with a flea shampoo (Not flea dips, they're dangerous). Wash them once a day for three days and make sure you wash all their bedding/wherever they sleep in hot water.

L6C66lAJaa	I had a Pit Bull for many years. We adopted him when he was about 2 or 3 years old. He had been abused his entire life, and was our neighbors dog, but came to our house all of the time. We ended up keeping him when the neighbors moved because they didn't want him anymore. He was such a love. And so loyal. People told us that he would turn on us, and attack us. He never did. He was such a great dog even after everything he had been through.I was so upset when he passed away at 12 years old. He didn't get along with other dogs either.  Sometimes that is just the way the dog is. Its not usually the breed, just the dog in general. Pit Bulls have a bad reputation, and I have found that it is usually because people only hear the bad and not the good. Truth is, there are many stories out there about Pit Bulls that do good that you just don't hear about. Instead of looking for videos, why don't you try searching for Pit Bull websites.  Here are a couple of links that might help get you started. Also, try Dogster.com. It's like a myspace for dogs. Check it out, and get into the breed of dog you are wondering about, and check out the forums. There are many people that could help you out there too. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nbc11.com/news/14434675/detail.html?dl=mainclick" rel="nofollow">http://www.nbc11.com/news/14434675/detai...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pitbulllovers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbulllovers.com/</a><br>  <br>  If this one doesn't come up email me and let me know I will send another link to it. <br>  <a href="http://www.pbrc.net/misc/PitBullBook8x101.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbrc.net/misc/PitBullBook8x10...</a>|`|inLtru7Laa	<a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitb...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pbrc.net/breedinfo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbrc.net/breedinfo.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bulldogbreeds.com/americanpitbullterrier.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bulldogbreeds.com/americanpit...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.badrap.org/rescue/breed.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.badrap.org/rescue/breed.cfm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pitbulllovers.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbulllovers.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wellbredpets.com/American-Pit-Bull-Terrier-breed-information.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wellbredpets.com/American-Pit...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pitbull.org.au/about_the_breed.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbull.org.au/about_the_bree...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vrcpitbull.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrcpitbull.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.karmarescue.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.karmarescue.org/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck with your adoption, i am sure you will make a good choice and be a responsible owner :)|`|kbkbDhwLaa	Dogs with a high prey drive will kill a rabbit, squirrel, bird, etc. if given the opportunity, and inclined to do it. My Shepherd/Lab/Dingo mix killed a rabbit at one point. Even Golden Retrievers and Border Collies have a prey drive.<br>  <br>  However, I agree that a Pitbull isn't appropriate for a first timer, unless you have had some sort of experience with the breed, or are knowledgeable on them. Research can give you said knowledge and prepare you for the breed. We have owned Pitbulls and obviously at one point, we had a first. He was just lovely. So do your research, determine whether the breed fits into your lifestyle or not, if you can handle all of the training and socialization a dog needs, and go from there.|`|pTYbhKf5aa	Of the three dogs we have, our Golden Retriever mix is the most prey-driven! They are all great dogs.  I loved the documentary on the Vick dogs that were rehabbed and many were placed with families.  I'd be curious about why the dog is recommended for a single dog household.  Even the trained fighting Vick dogs were rehabbed and got along great with other dogs after proper rehab.<br>  <a href="http://www.badrap.org/rescue/" rel="nofollow">http://www.badrap.org/rescue/</a><br>  Could be that the shelter is just worried about any issues that might arise because of the smear campaign on the breed. Otherwise, there could be some more serious problem with  this individual dog.  APBT's have a high drive to please their owners! They were historically bred to be very people friendly.  Many of them get along with other animals.<br>  One thing that surprised the people that rehabbed the Vick dog was that in spite of them being used as bait or fighting dogs, they not only were friendly towards people but almost every single one of them was good with other dogs as well.<br>  I wouldn't recommend any dog of any breed for a first time owner if it had a history of attacking other dogs with little to no provocation. That's a dog with a bad temperament which is not usual for an APBT.<br>  I'd ask for specific information about why they want this specific dog to go to a one dog household.|`|wTH9gKVsaa	their great dogs but they have sucha bad rap you have to be aware your taking on a great responsibility and probley will have to stand up for your dog and yourself. and it's not in their blood to kill small animals but without enough exercise their excess energy can come out in not so great ways i.e attacking small animals but that can happen with any dog so good luck and email me if you have question : ]|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	They need lots of excercise and things to chew|`|KXzUgTE0aa	Pit bulls are no first time dog owners.

tdiyhf68aa	you know, if you want to get around any animal, the easiest way is with food.........youll have to supervise this[probably w/ a leash] but skip a meal, for the bulldog.......then explain to your kids whats going on, [assuming they can understand, so they wont be scared] and hold the dog 3-5 feet away, have one w/ the food bowl, and the other w/ water, and put them down, and back up 6ft and watch....give the dog enough slack to reach the bowls, everybody watch for 20 sec and leave.........nx time 45 sec and so on, building both sides confidence, til you feel comfortable along with the dog an kids...............sooner than later the dog will accept the kids...............|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	This is so sad and the trainer was right when he said that the children's screaming causes the dog to react in this way.l have a rule and have followed it for many years l never sell pups to people with young children unless they have had one from me before and raised it with a young child competently.You are not to blame really as it is difficult to stop such young ones from screaming but on hindsight you should have laid down some ground rules to your little ones and explained how puppies and dogs react when a human squeals as they have very acute hearing and what you hear the dog hears a 100 time much louder and as a result this is the catalyst for the dog to attack out of fear and agitation not real aggression.You obviously love your dog but your love for your youngsters must outweigh this affection and the dog should be re-housed for your sake and your children's as one day the dog will give one then a bite on the face that may scar for life.l hate to tell you this but in life we have to face facts and you have done everything in your power to solve the terrible situation.If you decide to re-house the dog make sure it goes to a home where there are no young children even though they might be used to dogs as your pet has a pattern of behaviour now and will not change ever.|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Aggression is born from anxiety and fear. Something unfamiliar appears--be it an object, person, or other animal--and your dog interprets it as threatening. Genetics certainly affect a dog's capacity to tolerate the new or unexpected, and some breeds are just naturally more skittish than others. On average, for instance, Rat Terriers are more anxious while Labradors are more easygoing--but breeding is only part of the equation. <br>  here's what you can do:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/aggression-toward-people.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/aggression-toward-peo...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|MuD5oXQQaa	You need a new trainer.  As a trainer myself I wouldn't put up with that regardless of what the kids were doing.  The dog needs to be trained to ignore what the kids do.

Give it to someone who has the time and knowhow to train it. |`|0tCYtnPUaa	I don't necessarily think you need to get rid of the dog immediately, but biting ANYONE is unacceptable behavior for your dog.<br>  I would get a new trainer immediately if you can.  The dog needs to learn that you and your children are the alphas to him and a good trainer can make that happen.<br>  on the flip side, <br>  you have to protect your children, that comes first and foremost.  if you have reached the end of your rope, consider a bulldog rescue. I would be happy to help you with finding a good home for him where you can know for certain he is going to be cared for.<br>  I wish you well, and please let me know if I can help you.|`|AE5SkoE1aa	Have you considered A) having her fixed to cut back on some of her agression, and B) taking her to training or having private training done in your home with your two youngest children?  If I remember correctly, english bulldogs are very expensive, so I can understand why you wouldn't want to rehome her without trying to find another solution.  <br>  We had both of our dogs trained at Petco, and their trainer did do private sessions in home when needed.  I would look into a private trainer who will come to your home and work with the entire family to stop the aggressive behavior.  She will help the little ones learn what to do around the dog and what not to do around her.  <br>  I wish you the best of luck with this problem, and I hope I helped alittle.<br>  |`|K8t1lPXsaa	as the trainer said your kids haven't been properly socialized to be around a dog. you have to work as patiently with your kids as well as the dog. it won't happen overnight. for one exercise have someone hold your dog and sit down with your kids and just have them softly pet the dog. have the dog looking away from them so they are only petting the dog on the back and sides. use your own hand on top of theirs to guide their movements so they don't tug, poke or hesitate.<br>  <br>  look for other exercises you can do with your kids with a google search|`|Kz2jEQX7aa	The safety of your youngest children is obviously very important. The alarm bells started to ring when you said that your dog actually bit the kids. This is an absolute no no. May be it's a pecking order thing. Maybe the dog is still young. Nevertheless the combination of your two younger kids and this dog's temperment isn't working. Please find this dog a better life somewhere else. This situation is way too risky to try to fix it. Otherwise there's a real chance that something unspeakable might happen - and then it will be too late. <br>  Footnote: I just read your additional details. I am sorry for under estimating you. I am gob-smacked at your husband's blatant ignorance of this situation. Please follow your first instinct. Things might appear to get better, then one day when you're not looking, there's a real possibility of something dreadful happening to a defenceless child. This dog has a seriously bad trait towards your young kids. Please don't think it will get better because it won't. I used to have two "ferocious" Belgium Shepherd-X. Male and female (brother and sister). People would think twice before approaching them. But young kids would run up to them and fall all over them fearlessly, squashing their tails accidentally. You would hear a "Yelp" but there was no biting. My dogs just seemed to know these were just young kids. This is the calibre of dog you should only allow access to your precious kids.|`|L6C66lAJaa	Secluding your dog from the family will only make it worse. She is still very much a puppy. I have a puppy the same age, and I taught him not to do that stuff by squirting him. Whenever he did something bad, I got out the squirt bottle and shot him with water. I know it sounds cruel, but really its not. It is very effective, and doesn't hurt them, they just don't like the water. Never Ever shake a puppy or any dog. That will only teach them to be more aggressive. Someone taught your dog to be like that, because they aren't born knowing it. Perhaps your children played with her to rough, and she thinks they are playing with her now. She doesn't understand what she is doing wrong. Please try the water bottle method, it works trust me.

They suffer through a lot of health problems.  Teacups are bred by people who only want your money and don't really care about the dogs.  There is actually no such thing as a teacup dog.  It is just a very small, undersized member of a breed.  Pocket puppy, teacup, same ripoff.  A raze of dogs?  What's that?  Do you mean a breed of dog?  The Chihuahua is the smallest breed.  For good quality puppies bred by conscientious, reputable breeders, go to <a href="http://www.akc.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org</a> but first do a lot more research about dogs and which ones suit your lifestyle, personality, time and space available, income level, age, etc. best.  Read some books!|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	Teacup is puppy mill talk for sickly runt that's going to cost thousands in vet bills before dying before it's first birthday.<br>  <br>  Dogs do not belong inside pockets, purses, teacups, coffee cups, or anything else.  They belong on the ground on four legs, and it works better if they're sturdy enough to walk without breaking their own legs.<br>  <br>  A Chihuahua weighs no more than 6lbs full grown.  If that's too big for you, guess what?  GET A HAMSTER!!  |`|K8t1lPXsaa	there is no such thing as a teacup. it's a marketing term for smaller than normal aka smaller than healthy<br>  <br>  yes a lot of these dogs are either unhealthy, easily suffer from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or are easily injured. for anyone that wants a teacup i always tell them of the story of an owner who had a "teacup" yorkie. she accidentally dropped the a regular tv remote which landed on the yorkie and sent the dog into a coma. that's no joke. you have to be VERY careful<br>  <br>  because these dogs or so small they can't spend too much time playing. they need a lot of attention and will have to have 3-4 small meals throughout its entire life. you will. if your dog doesn't maintain its energy it could easily slip into a sugar coma like a diabetic <br>  <br>  don't get a "teacup" chihuahua. get a regular one with a healthy background. chihuahuas were born to be small. why go through the unnecessary hassle or a self proclaimed "teacup"?|`|kbkbDhwLaa	Yes, they are unhealthy. They are bred to be exceptionally tiny, when a Chihuahua is usually only 4-6 pounds to begin with. Their internal organs aren't as large and developed as others, their bones can easily break, and you're looking at quite a bit in vet bills throughout the life of the dog.<br>  <br>  Yes, they need a lot of special care. They cannot jump from even a sofa as they risk breaking a bone.<br>  <br>  Neither. There is no such thing as a teacup. It is a word used to describe them to make more money. It's a scam.<br>  <br>  No such thing as a pocket puppy either.<br>  <br>  As for being smaller than Chihuahuas, why in the hell would anyone want something smaller than 4 pounds? The Chihuahua is the smallest dog breed in existence. You cannot find a breed smaller.|`|6XTETdJaaa	SG was right on. They dont really exist, they are just sickly little dogs, bred by poor so called breeders. You would be hard pressed to find a long lived healthy tea cup. They cost way to much and cost even more in health bills. You want a real breed, bred by a real breeder who heakth tests her dogs. <br>  <br>  Regular chihuahuas and toy poodles are already small dogs, go for those. <br>  <br>  All dogs need lots of attention, its part of being a living being. <br>  <br>  A dog key chain is very tiny and low maintenance|`|B462BQYzaa	if u want something smaller than a chihuahua consider getting a guinea pig - teacups or in other words, runts are not suppose to bred and slap on a cute name for ppl to buy - they are unhealthy and many owners freak out when they accidently step on them.  please do us all a favor and get a regular dog or dont get one at all.|`|7e3CgdDHaa	1. Are they unhealthy?<br>  Very. Teacups are the sickly too-small runts of the litter, probably the ones that have the most problems and shouldn't be bred.<br>  <br>  2. Do they need a lot of Special Care?<br>  Vet bills will rise and you will find that the precious little teacup you bought just isn't as cute when it breaks out in hives because it is allergic to every possible thing<br>  <br>  3. Give me some tips?<br>  Try getting the same breed, but in the actual size. For example, just get a chihuahua, they don't grow to be too large, and instead of a teacup poodle, get a miniature poodle, they are smaller and much healthier :)<br>  <br>  4. It's the same as a pocket puppy and teacup puppy?<br>  Basically. There are no differences aside from the name<br>  <br>  4. Another breed?<br>  Try this site- <a href="http://www.puppyfinder.com/breedselector.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.puppyfinder.com/breedselector...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck in your doggie search :) |`|jGcFfnCSaa	You're not going to find anyone on this board that is supportive of the idea of 'teacup' dogs.<br>  <br>  The truth? There's no such thing. 'Teacup' dogs are, in reality, sickly runts that poor breeders slap a cute name and a high price tag onto. They are often riddled with health problems because of their state and poor breeding. Please, don't be drawn in by the so-called 'teacup' dog fad. If you want a dog, buy one from a reputable breeder or adopt from a shelter.|`|qN6PU5PLaa	i have to agree with that answer, they are runts with severe health problems, greedy breeders put a fancy price and stupid buyers fall for
Xw5A7ObVaa	My dog does this too!  We're not sure why, but I was reading something about wild dogs a while ago, and apparently they bury part of the meat to come back to it later (like some dogs bury bones in the garden) - so maybe our dogs are doing that - but it looks wierd because its inside the house instead.|`|IDQVXU7Laa	He's probably trying to hide some of his food. My dog does this all the time and goes back later to finish it off. Don't worry, it's normal for dogs to do this.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	he's probably searching just to double check that he didn't drop any of it on the floor. especially if he eats in a hurry|`|SsOvxYckaa	My dog always eats in a hurry then spends the next 10 minutes checking that he hasn't dropped any!  <br>  <br>  Maybe your dog is just been more efficient and checking as he goes?

hbj6vGE4aa	1. Make sure that the dog has NO mats in its hair. Try to untangle them with your fingers, or be really gentle with a comb. They are impossible to remove if the dog gets washed with them.<br>  2. Bathe the dog. Try to avoid sulfur based shampoos. You will probably have to special order a shampoo, as most commerical stores have cheapo shampoo (I use buddy wash ordered from kvvet.com. You can try petedge.com as well) I use herbal essence conditioner on my shih tzu, and it seems to work fine. I like the smell :)<br>  3. Blow dry the dog using a comb and/or slicker brush. It is easier to do if you have a dog grooming table with a noose. Be patient, it takes a while for a dog to get used to a blow dryer. I use a forced air dryer on my aussie, and a human blow dryer on my shih tzu and schnauzers. It depends on how thick the coat of your lhasa is.<br>  4. Trimming. Using a blunt nosed scissor, trim between the paw pads. Brush the hair straight down and trim around the paw, so that the hair doesn't brush the ground. If you are going for this kind of a look: <a href="http://www.dogsindepth.com/nonsporting_d..." rel="nofollow">http://www.dogsindepth.com/nonsporting_d...</a> Then don't trim the bridge of the nose, top of the head, tail, legs, etc. Leave them be.<br>  5. Nails. Invest in a grinder. I use a dremmel, some use pedi paws. They are both the same idea. You can get much closer to the quick than you can with clippers, and the finish is much smoother. An added bonus is that the grinder doesn't split the nails.<br>  6. Teeth. Brush them. Get them cleaned yearly by the vet.<br>  7. Ears. You will need to pluck them. I use a curved hemostat. This is a necessary evil to prevent ear infections. My dogs cry, because it hurts. Put a tiny bit of ear powder in the ears, and grasp a little bit of hair at a time. Please be careful that you don't hurt the dog, or go to deep with the hemostat. You could just try and use your fingers, this works well with one of my schnauzers.<br>  <br>  Whew, I think that is it!<br>  <br>  Just a note. Keeping a dog in a long coat is a TON of work. I really like to keep my dogs in tip top show coat, if it is possible. My shih tzu was beautiful, with a long flowing coat and perfect little top knot. But, since he is not a show dog, but just a pet, I opted to shave him down, for a couple of reasons. He was soooo hot in his full coat. And, brushing out the mats was litterally hell for me to do, and it made him cry. It was too much work for me, in addition to the other dogs I have to care for. I cried when I shaved him, but he is happier for it. <br>  <br>  If you have more questions, you are welcome to contact me.<br>  |`|RZzMse3Haa	Those de-shedding brushes REALLY Help!!! You know those kind that pulls the hair out of the undercoat? I see them all over the place called different things, so I hope you know what I'm talking about.<br>  <br>  |`|K8t1lPXsaa	you'll need a slicker brush, a metal detangler  brush/comb, a metal comb and a fine tooth metal flea comb to prevent matting. that's what i use for my yorkie's hair. depending on the length you'll need to brush about every other day at minimum. if you want it to nearly drag on the floor daily combing at least twice a day.|`|BWtjfkCdaa	You should brush like once every day or one day his/her hair will be very tangled and his/her hair will fall out because you will be pulling to comb a spot. You don't want that to happen.<br>  OMG!!! My dog is yorkie mixed with lhasa apso!!!<br>   Hope this helps :)|`|okdPuy1Kaa	Brush it every day! There are conditioners you can use after shampooing, that help keep it slick and easier to brush. <br>  <br>  I could never do it.... I tried but it was hard!!! Lots of upkeep. Good luck!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It depends on the dog's breed and coat type.  But with long haired dogs, daily brushing is necessary to prevent mats.|`|EcjfWdsbaa	If you want to grow the coat out, you will need to brush and comb your dog every day. Don't wait until the coat gets longer, you need to start now while its shorter. If you don't take care of the coat and it gets matted, the only option may be to shave it all off and start over.<br>  You can't just use a slicker brush on this breed, you must make sure to also use a comb. You can get a metal comb at the petstore. The brush will only get the topcoat, using a comb will get down to the skin, which is essential in making sure your dog doesn't get matted.|`|2co8VRwMaa	I've got a long haired dog (a Samoyed) and the trick is to give it a really thorough grooming to get out all the knots and matts, maybe give it a bath if necessary, and then to regularly brush the dog, a quick brush once every day or 2, then a really good brush once every week.|`|XHNURm6Xaa	Well first of all you would need some shampoo & conditioner, if you live in the country than wash him about every other day.  If you live in the city you can go for maybe every three days.  Then you will have to comb him about every day if you live in the city or not.  I recomend a fine pet brush for dog's specialy!!!<br>  :)|`|f0RsoN13aa	brush your dog everyday to keep the coat nice and not matted
yh3OBqyTaa	I'm 51 years old and have heard this story many times. It happens all the time. A dog is a descendent of the wolf, and has it's homing instincts. Dogs have a very keen sense of smell, too. We had a Bull Mastiff that was stolen. She came home after about 3 months, had a heavy rope tied around her neck, had lost about 20 pounds and and had worn her paw pads down to raw red meat, but she came home. It is just the miracle of being a dog that knows where it's home is and wants to get there to be back with his pack. |`|MGAmNxddaa	Dogs have a sense of direction that is untouchable.I don't understand it,I'm not sure if there is actually any scientific reason for dogs to be that far from home and still find their way.I would just hope that if I ever lost a dog that it would be able to find me.|`|ydshiNrKaa	It has to be some kind of built in radar system animals have in their head.

I would keep the outside door open a little bit so he can get into your hall or mud room or even garage. So he has some shelter.  When you wake up I hope little Puffer will be waiting for you.

6XTETdJaaa	There is no one best brand. There are qualities that are  desirable in a dog food, but no one food is best for every dog.<br>  <br>  Good brands to try inclue: Merrick, blue buffalo, wilderness, Canidae, chicken soup for the dog lovers soul, innove, evo, fromm, now, wellness, wellness core, orijen<br>  <br>  If your dogs not already on a good food here are some things to concider (condenced version) <br>  <br>  You want a dog food that is free or corn, by-products, long lists of chemicals and unpronouncable words, BHA, BHT, and ethoxtquin, sugar, and coloring. All grocery and department store brands contain these. <br>  <br>  You also want to see a high protein content from quality, named, meat sources. For example beef, beef meal, chicken, chicken meal. Not poulty or meat meal. This can mean litterally anything that walks or flys. The word by-product essencially means the entire animal was thrown in the blender, feathers, fur, beaks, undeveloped offspring, yummy. Check out the label on Iams, purina, or Pedigree and see what I mean. You also want to see at least three of the first five ingrediants be these quality protein sources.<br>  <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com</a> for more info. You can look up any dog food, get the rating, pros, cons, and full list of ingredients|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Anything with corn, wheat, gleutens, soy or by products in it are JUNK foods and should be avoided.  I used Canidae til they changed the formula and didn't tell us about the change so now I dont' trust them.  Now we use Wellness adult.  My dog is doing better on it than the Canidae.  You can get it at Petco.  Other good foods all available at Petco are Merrick, Eagle Pack Holistic, Innova, Natures Balance, Solid Gold.  You can get Blue Buffalo at Petsmart.  Stay away from Science Diet, Iams, Eukanuba and all other foods that you can get at a grocery store or Walmart as they are just over priced corn and by product meal.  Nothing by Purina either, garbage. <br>  You dont' necessarily need to get a high protein dog food, just a good quality one with meat or poultry as the first and second named ingredients and none of the other stuff that I said before.  Sometimes too high of protein gets the dog kidney problems so watch out.  You dont need anything above 26%-30% protein...any more is just waste.|`|26PPwzrWaa	I feel the quality of Evo makes it one of the best foods on the market, but that isn't saying dogs dont disagree with the food either because I know many that can not live off of it. <br>  <br>  Here are some dog food sites that will help you figure out what ingredients to avoid and what foods to look for. <br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=betterproducts" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a> <br>  www.dogfoodanalysis.com(stay in the 5 to 6 star range)<br>  A good forum for dog food or nutrition is www.bigdogsporch.com<br>  <br>  If you are going to feed premade dog food, I highly suggest reading as much as you can about it, the dog food project site will help you the most, but the forum will as well because there is a canine nutritionist on the site.

The air dried version is 85% meat and organs from only hormone free, antibiotic free and naturally fed protein sources.  It's the highest quality commercial food available on the market.|`|D6EJ9MVxaa	Not Iams (as stated above) it has corn and wheat which is not good for a dog. To get the best food you are going to have to spend money. You want to make sure that you choose a food that has a meat listed as 2 of the top 4 ingredients. Preferably chicken because it is nutritious. <br>  <br>  Honestly, the best food is not sold at Wal-Mart or grocery stores. I feed Diamond Naturals Chicken & Rice formula. My dogs do very well on it.

OwrycBfAaa	Actually demodex or demodectic mange is caused by mites, an external parasite ie: mite. The severity is based on the dogs immune syndrome. <br>  Younger dogs can be affected more than older dogs who's immune syndrome is naturally more developed. In most cases this is actually transfered at time of nursing and in most cases really does not become an issue. If it does you will see areas of hair loss. In the Miniature Pinscher being that the breed is prone to skin issues such as dry skin, this is than referred to as alopecia. General treatment in the past was with Mitaban. This medication is considered generally not available any longer though was very good at resolving this problem. Many assume that alopecia is only found in the Blue and Fawn Miniature Pinschers but in fact all colors are subject to it. <br>  There are Mitaban dips that can be done by vets and are usually done weekly until skin scrape show negative for the mite. <br>  Other options are Ivermectin and Milbemiycin. These though can have side effects so best to discuss with your vet. <br>  I have never seen an issue or heard of one where the mange was worsened due to stress and mine are crated for long periods. <br>  This breed though if exercised completely will have no problems sleeping for long periods of time when crated and it is a breed that does need to be crate trained early. This is in fact a "Terrier" not a Toy breed. It is high energy and high prey drove if it lives up to its true breed so one minute it can be moving 100 miles an hour and the next it can be sound asleep. <br>  Good Luck<br>  ps...I would stick to the crating, the breed by nature is mischievious and very intelligent and can find a way out of anything but a crate if at all possible. |`|NAGiNKFWaa	It is usually 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a 2 month old puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 3 hours at the most.  <br>  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.

OwrycBfAaa	It is true that shock collars should not be used on such an undersized dog as the one you have. If you want an alternate solution, try covering the crate when you are gone and see if this does not curb much of the barking.

AA11323924	Once a day, if that. Since they are native to the southeast united states, it doesnt rain several times in their natual habitat daily. If you want to simulate the rain as closely as possible to their natural environment, mist 1-2 times per day during the summer months, 1 every other day in the spring/fall and 1 every 3-5 days during the winter months. Dont just mist the frog. If you use a normal spray bottle, just hold it at least 12 inches from the top of the tank and mist the whole area evenly. |`|4wPGdPryaa	Try and keep it at a steady pace all day

The teeth tend to fall out back to front, starting at 3 months and ending at 6 months.  The back ones usually get swallowed and go unnoticed.  At 5 months, the front teeth are getting loose.  So at this age, it's more likely you'll notice when one falls out.|`|lhbpBnBAaa	Yes, kittens will lose their deciduous teeth and grow in their adult teeth, right about your kitten's age.|`|pMUZVP1Oaa	Yes, kittens, puppies and kids lose baby teeth.

Gc94X8Cjaa	Rearing is a very dangerous habit for a horse to get into.  I agree with  Richard K, get some professional help and figure out what's going on with Winchester.   I'm glad that you have checked your tack and gear and that it's not causing the problem, this shows that you're on the right track.  However, rearing has the potential to injure or kill both you and Winchester.  Have a vet look at him, and make sure that Winchester isn't in pain when you're riding.  A well fitting saddle (or any weight) can cause pain if the horse's back or spine is injured.  Also, please tell your Mom that it's not ethical to sell Winchester without disclosing his rearing problem, and that many people will not buy a horse that rears. Also, if she doesn't disclose this problem, and the new owner is injured due to rearing, she could be liable for those injuries.  So it's in Winchester's, your and her interest to get to the bottom of this issue.  <br>  <br>  And please be careful when you are working with him, either riding or on the ground.  I understand that you really love this horse, and you sound like you are doing a great job trying to figure this out.  Kudos to you for your concern.  And good luck.|`|YzwuDRfYaa	You don't say how old he is  ...  but it sounds as though he has not been completely broken.<br>  <br>  Try and find an experienced horseman to handle this problem.|`|YN2sI8sfaa	The reason why he might be bucking is because of your saddle. It might be hurting his back or he might have a back problem. The girth might also be pinching him and that might cause him to buck. Now for the rearing it could be is bit it might be too sensitive for his mouth. But i dont  know what else to day. Im sorry|`|ckThq20Faa	Okay, I don't know how to fix the rearing but i do know how to fix the bucking. Now when you ride him carry a crop on you. When he bucks, pull back and stop him right away and him him with the crop and say "no!" (its more like a yell though).Make sure when you pull back he stops dead right away. Then continue going. Now I know this because my old appy used to do this. I may sound sorta harsh but it's effective!|`|0e4717adeb40245dca1e15c4ff227ed6aa	Have a chiropractor take a look at him. Horses rarely act up to such extremes without good reason- like being in pain. If his back is hurting him, bucking and rearing are not that surprising. My horse had back problems and as a result she became unruly under saddle, but it was because she was trying to tell me she was in pain, and that was the only way she knew how to do it. Also, have a saddle fitter check your saddle to see that it fits. Unless you are very experienced in the area of saddle fitting, it's best to have a professional take a look at it. If these things don't help get the assistance of a trainer to help you- one who actually has previous experience correcting these problems- not one who just says that they are a trainer.|`|Vh4HpFPdaa	If the horse was sweet when you got him, and isn't anymore than it IS you. <br>  <br>  Call a trainer, clearly you got a horse that's way too much for you, and you need some serious help, before you get hurt or before you hurt him.<br>  <br>  Call a professional, get some help.<br>  <br>  And saying that it's 'not you' is like a blinking neon sign that says 'This is my fault! I did something wrong! I need some help!' <br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be mean, but that's the reality of it. I've been through something similar, and it takes a professional's help when you've gotten to this point. Especially when you're in denial and too ignorant to clearly see what's going on. A good rider says 'help me fix what I'm doing wrong,' and not 'fix my horse.'|`|TuRwRamhaa	It sounds like he may be confused. Horses typically buck b/c of pain, balance issues, confusion, or freshness, same goes for rearing. There is two things you can do ride him through it (please whatever you do do not stop him) just make him go forward and don't yell. Both bucking and rearing are not bad behaviours they are a reaction. And also I would get a trainer I know he's nine but it may be that he has not been trained to do what your asking of him, or he has behavioural problems. Hope this helps!|`|99bqB5bTaa	As lots of people say, get him checked out, but also you could try doing lots of parreli groundwork. This worked miracles with my horse, an 8 year old gelding who used to take off bucking. I am only 13 and now I can control him really easily. Parreli is natural and it encourages you not be hurtful to your horse. It got my horse to listen to me a lot better and he is now WAY more respectful!|`|EZ9zcTNraa	you need to take SMALL steps and get your horse comnfortable with the saddle or w/e|`|KSPLR265aa	First, check for pain. Have him examined by a vet. If he was sweet when you got him, maybe he's developed a painful problem. He may refuse because it hurts, then buck or rear to make you stop hurting him.<br>  <br>  If it's not pain, you can handle a rear by throwing your body weight on one rein to one side. Be ready to jump off if he falls.<br>  <br>  For bucking, keep his head up. Again on the single rein, pull his head around to your knee and make him turn in circles.<br>  <br>  Remember, in all horse "control" (when you have to muscle him around) one rein is more powerful than two, His neck is strong going straight, but not so much side-to-side.|`|PQop22Tuaa	i completly agree with the person who stated if your horse is moving forward he can not rare on you, just keep pushing for forward motion<br>  <br>  also what gear are you using, sometimes people put so much gear on horses that is just not needed because they think its a suitable vice when really it could be a problem for you horse??<br>  the other is if he is bucking definatly get a chiropractor have a look at his back, generally its a pain thing, but it also comes down to he knows that he can do this with you, and nothing really seems to be happening, you have to make him understand that what he is doing is not allowed.. you are the boss of him . he will soon understand..<br>  <br>  My horse used to buck, from bad back problems, but his biggest vice was reversing, even if could not do anything he would still go backwards if he did not want to do it.. for other people and 20 times 0ut of 20 times if others were riding him would get straight off.. it took alot of work to stop him doing this...<br>  <br>  dont give up ..YOU ARE THE BOSS!! <br>  keep moving forward, get him looked at for sure..|`|xvuiJTnLaa	LISTEN TO THIS ANSWER!!!!!!  there is one fix to ALL horse ridding problems. its not pulling the head up, or turning in a tight circle. are you listening???? you Have to keep your leg on and send him FORWARD!!!! for rearing, he can't rear if he's GOING SOMEWHERE!!  you have to be able to have a good enough seat and stay on to be effective. if you don't, you can't be effective. you don't need a different bit or anything, what you need is some one to ride him and work with you. he knows he can get away with it so he's going to do it. PLEASE invest in a good trainer that can help you!!!

UQoSNUyQaa	Parvo is transmitted by fecal matter.  You could walk through a tiny amount and have it on your shoes, and take it back to your place and expose it to your dogs and puppies.  They can get it on their paws and then lick their paws.  It's a very serious illness and can be picked up easily.  Symptoms include vomitting and diarrhea, as well as the puppy/dog being lethargic (very tired).  It continues to get worse until it takes the puppy's/dog's life.  It can be fatal.  If you get the puppy/dog to the vet immediately with first symptoms, there is a chance it could be saved.<br>  <br>  Nursing puppies do have some maternal antibodies, if the Mom is up to date on her vaccations.  But, this is not a guarantee that they won't get it.  Even puppy shots given before the age of 16 weeks are no guarantee, but the shots are given about every 3 weeks starting around 6-9 weeks (depending on your vet) to catch when the maternal antibodies leave the puppy's system.<br>  <br>  If you are suspect that something is wrong with the puppies, it would be best to have them taken in and checked, especially if you feel they may have been exposed to parvo.  |`|ZnjWMOq4aa	my dog had parvo.<br>  <br>  Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV2, colloquioally parvo) is a contagious virus mainly affecting dogs. The disease is highly infectious and is spread from dog to dog by direct or indirect contact with their feces. It can be especially severe in puppies that are not protected by maternal antibodies or vaccination. It has two distinct presentations, a cardiac and intestinal form. The common signs of the intestinal form are severe vomiting and severe haemmorhagic (bloody) diarrhea. The cardiac form causes respiratory or cardiovascular failure in young puppies. Treatment often involves hospitalization at a veterinary centre. Vaccines can prevent this infection, but mortality can reach 91% in untreated cases.<br>  <br>  There are two types of canine parvovirus called canine minute virus (CPV1) and CPV2. CPV2 causes the most serious disease and affects domesticated dogs and wild canids. There are variants of CPV2 called CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. Types 2a and 2b are quite similar to the original CPV type 2 but 2c is more distinct and this has led to claims of ineffective vaccination of dogs. However, studies have shown that the existing CPV vaccines based on CPV type 2b, provide adequate levels of protection against CPV type 2c.<br>  <br>  |`|Uy7XEqcpaa	omg its the worst thing ever!!! parvo sucks..its sad...like when they die all the blood comes out their bodies and they get really skinny until they are sucked dry literally. i dont know how they get them ...but when i lived in Las Vegas my dad bread dogs anand theets out there said its really common for dogs to get parvo out there...but the vets out here in cali say its not so common..sometimes different environments are more likely to get parvo than others..i will look into it!!! 6 to 8 weeks they can get their shots for it.|`|rbgwALtVaa	check out this site, it explains facts about Parvo. symptoms, causes, treatments...etc.|`|AA10720479	Dogs will vomit, and they have very smelly diarrhea, wont ear or drink. They will get very skinny, in about 3 days they will die. Dog can get it from other infected dogs by saliva, or fecal matter. I lost a dog to this, she was fine one day the next vomiting,Diarrhea, and the next I had her humanely put down, because she was so bad the  vet E.R. said she wouldn't make it. This was the Absolutely hardest thing I ever had to do. This disease is extremely pain full, and contagious. The vet said that she had a very powerful strain of the disease, and the puppy shots she got didn't affect it. If your mother dog had all of her shots and she is still nursing the puppies, you shouldn't have anything to worry about, but they need their puppy shots when they get old enough|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Parvo is easily transmittable and can be carried to unvacinated dogs by people who have been around dogs sheding the disease or where those dogs have been on clothing and shoes.  It can live for 6 months or more in untreated environments that have been infected.  <br>  <br>  Parvo attacks the digestive system.  Early signs are diarrhea, vomiting and lethargy <br>  <br>  It should also be noted that for reasons unknown Black and Tan breeds  tend to be more suceptable to parvo than other breeds and are often less likely to recover.   <br>  <br>  If puppies (or any dog) becomes infected they should be taken to the vet immediatly.  90% or more of untreated puppies and dogs do not survive the disease.

pRnUS4dDaa	Wow.  You have an unaltered female dog that you didn't watch vigilantly when she was in season?<br>  <br>  If a male dog was able to get to her, it's a good chance she's pregnant.

XdlsbLrLaa	It could mean a few things. If a cat isn't drinking water ( or eating ) it's a sign that they don't feel well. Don't allow your cat to go too long without any water because dehydration sets in fast with cats. <br>  <br>  If your kitty is simply not drinking water yet seems fine otherwise ... still playful etc, then you could have the same problem I have with one of my cats. All of a sudden one day ... one of my 4 cats stopped drinking the water out of the 5 water dishes around the house. After a while I tried to change the water dishes around ... tried new ones ... still nothing. So I called my vet and my vet said to try putting a glass dish up on the counter or a nightstand ... somewhere off the ground. So I got a little glass water dish and put it on the nightstand next to the bed where she normally sleeps and ... VIOLA! She started drinking. <br>  <br>  According to my vet, some cats don't like the smell of plastic first of all. A lot of water feeder type things are plastic. Secondly, some cats are selective and don't like drinking their water off the ground. So if you raise the water up off the ground, they prefer to drink it that way. <br>  <br>  Hope one of these two suggestions helps!|`|uKhe48Npaa	It probably prefers milk|`|b8f51eff5dbe2bc310be76585193bb07aa	What Does It Mean When you don't drink water? to the post above it wasn't directed at you rather the OP!

I'm not sure if that is actually the reason, but for whatever reason alot of cats won't drink from their water bowl if it is kept near the food bowl. <br>  <br>  If this still doesn't work, you might want to feed them wet food at least once a day so that they are getting adequate water in their diet. |`|qGfvRJsbaa	Noooooooo don't give your cat milk. <br>  <br>  <br>  My cat threw up EVERYWHERE when I gave it milk. =/|`|pDVDe4p2aa	It probably does drink water and you don't see it.  
K8t1lPXsaa	8-9 hours is actually considered too long to be crated unless it's time to sleep. 4-6 hours should be how long the dog is in there based upon his age. also you should clean with a solution that states it's a pet stain odor remover. the crate should only be big enough to comfortably go in and turn around. i'm guessing based on the general size of your dog you should have a 19" or 23" kennel|`|p7swtBYzaa	You are "only" gone 8 to 9 hours ???   Are you crazy??<br>  <br>  No pup can be expected to hold it that long and sure shouldn't be crated anywhere near that long.<br>  <br>  You're an adult and I bet you don't "hold it" 8 or 9 hours - now I've heard everything - talk about cruel and unusual!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|a9YfUGzSaa	Either he CAN'T hold it for that long, your crate is too big.|`|cChQmoiKaa	dogs usually do not go inside their crate. Your dog is obviously too young to hold it in and is desperate to go to the bathroom! Get someone to walk him during the day.|`|d12wIp3faa	I agree. Your crate is probably too big.A crate serves as den to the dog. The crate should only be large enough for the pup to stand up and turn around. Otherwise the pup will use one end for sleep and the other for business. Either get a smaller crate for now until he grows into the one you have, or block use of one end with a box or something immobile (you may be able to find a crate divider) so he only has enough room for sleeping. Good Luck!<br>  <br>  o, and at 6 months...a pup can hold it for a while. when they are in their kennels their bodies go into a state of rest and their bodily functions aren't as active. My pups hold overnight easily, even when around 6 months.|`|l3uihdgVaa	<br>    Ok, don't crate your dog all day long. That's considered neglect & your dog is most likely showing signs of seperation anxiety. This can turn into a life long habit, so you need to stop it right away. Purchase an X pen (new or used exercise pen) and put your pup in there during the day if you don't want him wandering around the house. Put puppy pads in the pen, away from his food. When he needs to relieve himself during the day, he should have a designated place to do it & if you don't provide that for him, you can't expect anything more than what you're getting- which is a confused puppy!!<br>  <br>    When your puppy is older, you might want to invest in a doggy door so that he can come & go as he pleases while you're gone during the day. For now, provide a soft place for him to lay on in the pen, along with water & a chew toy. Don't stop crating him at night...just make sure the crate is ONLY big enough for him to stand, stretch & lay down. Block off any excess room or he will continue to use it as a toilet. He's confused...just un-do it & you guys will be fine! When he goes outside, praise him immediately w/ treats & affection.<br>  <br>    As far as your pup eating his "stuff"...this should stop when you adjust his bathroom habits. It's also possible that he's hungry! One time, my dog ate my 2 yr old's poop (long story) and I was HORRIFIED to say the least!!! We have to realize that dogs are animals, creatures of instinct. Who knows why they do the things they do sometimes! In conclusion, never stop learning about your dog & dogs in general. This will make you a better owner & your dog a better pet. Congratulations on your puppy & hang in there!! Good luck :)
pDKm9Wmgaa	No, it is not true. Cat bites are usually bad because of the bacteria in their mouths, and if someone is allergic to cats, a bite can be doubly bad. People can get 'Cat Scratch Fever' which is a misnomer, from a bite. Cat Scratch Fever is an immune response to cat saliva, which in a person who has been bitten, makes the bite far worse. The immune system goes into overdrive and the person gets very sick, hospital sick. <br>  But a cat just licking you will not cause Cat Scratch Fever. If you are allergic to cats, I don't think you'd be able to be in the same room with one, let alone have it lick you. <br>  The other thing that cats do carry is Toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is a parasite that can cause flu like symptoms in some people. Others have no symptoms at all. But if a woman who is the early stage of pregnancy contracts Toxoplasmosis, it could induce miscarriage. <br>  BUT that does not mean you have to get rid of your cat. Toxoplasmosis is passed in the feces. If you have a cat, wearing rubber gloves or having someone else clean the litterbox will take care of the problem. |`|RN1wGlWWaa	No - I've never heard that before, but its false information.|`|4TX26viFaa	If you believed everything you hear you'd be very vulnerable to con men, a perfect target.<br>  <br>  No, cat saliva isn't making anyone sterile. It's mouth secretions just like we have, or like dogs have or any other mammal.  I suspect someone's feeding you a line of bull to see just how naive you really are.  <br>  <br>  If this were true about cats don't you think it'd be all over the papers and internet? As well as every cat book on the market?  Get real.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	I know way to many women that have cats and continue having children for it to be true.<br>  <br>  Letting a cat lick a wound is more likely to give an infection than a cure. Cats carry bacteria that can cause problems for humans.|`|b752fd6326ba18cebce3a336a9e16a09aa	i doubt dat very seriously, cuz if dat was true<br>  i dont think sum of the women be doing wut they usualy do!!!|`|Ep7fwAtFaa	probably not if you are worried talk to your doc|`|Pe4UkyUnaa	I know that it can help heal a wound, my cat did it to me.

jTeDpBjlaa	The cage doesn't have to stay warm when the snake is not in there.<br>  <br>  BTW, It's ok for the temperature to drop for a short bit. That's how it is in the wild, anyway.<br>  <br>  You move the lamp while you play with your snake. (Your snake will absorb heat from your hands!) And when you place the snake back into the cage, you place the lamp back on the cage. The temperature will rise slowly back to normal.<br>  <br>  FYI, a snake that's at normal temperature (between 70 and 90 deg) will always feel cool to your warmer hands (Remember, your body temperature is ~98.6! Anything cooler than that will feel "cool.")<br>  <br>  If you are still worried, you can get heating pads from the pet store to put under or stick behind the cage. <br>  <br>  Also, ignore ignorant people who tell you to "release the snake into the jungle." That snake was probably captive bred. It would be like releasing a pet dog onto the interstate, ESPECIALLY if it is a special pattern, such as albino or "Pie-bald."|`|oUTb1zNkaa	It's ok for the cage to get a little cool while you have the snake out. Just put his light back on when you put him in. It doesn't take long to heat up. If he's cold he'll instinctively find the warmest part of the tank and hang out there.|`|O1VcREmJaa	Don't mind Alex. He is obviously bitter. It is ok to ask questions. No one knows everything.<br>  t is ok for he temperature to drop slightly. Your snake will be fine. Next time you take him out just leave the light on setting on top of the lid while you handle him. I'd get an undertank heater and place it under the tank (make sure it is on the outside so the snake cant physcally touch it or he could burn himself).|`|brcEtJjGaa	highly suggest either a ceramic heat emitter with a rheostat to dim down the temp over night.<br>  <br>  OR a under tank heating pad with a rheostat so you can. adjust temps for the day and night one it.<br>  <br>  i used to leave the lamp on in the day and ceramic heater on low art night.  but then i got a big heating pad that covers half the tank and that alone keeps the tank at 80 degrees belly heat.  thought i dim it down at night for it to reach 76 degrees.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helps.  don't mind alex.  obviously doesn't know one thing about snakes.  if a captive bred [which yours could possibly be] will not survive in the wild.|`|P0FKlVRGaa	i think u should use a reptiheatpad its sticky on one side and you put it on the bottom of the tank and he gets a lot of body heat so when you take him out he holds his body heat and just keep the lamp over night and get it tomorrow|`|s23zbrxjaa	Simple process for warming your cage.<br>  <br>  Remove animal from cage/tank.  Place cage/tank in oven on 200 degrees F.  After 26 minutes remove the cage/tank; it is no warmed up.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Except for Alex, good advice given.  Temp should be okay, but you may want to look at investing in a heater that works from the bottom if you find it not working with you as is.<br>  <br>  And don't let your pet go in the wild.  After being domesticated, they normally don't live.  It's such bad advice like that is the reason we have animal shelters filled to capacity and pets being put down.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Turn the lamp back on!
vJg5k342aa	Yes, it's actually rather easy.  The easiest way to do it is through shaping by clicker training.  Go to <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com</a> and do some reading about clicker training in itself and "shaping".  <br>  <br>  You can achieve the finished product by combining several smaller skills like training him to retrieve, hold the toy in his mouth, go to the basket and put the toy in the basket.  All these skills should be taught separately and shouldn't be combined until each one is completely learned.|`|wosqwK3Daa	Just a question, what breed of dog is this? Not that it makes too much of a difference, just some dogs are more servile than others and would be easier to teach. Dogs like Chihuahuas (that behave more like cats) would be a challenge. |`|2G4qmjyKaa	yea it is, my dad tought a cat to use and flush the toilet over a long course of short training sessions. So a dog is easier to train and so it is possible. |`|opVutvuWaa	yes|`|wOCMcnMZaa	defiantly. there is a way i just don't know what way|`|NX23JRGEaa	     I know of dogs that are trained to recycle and put stuff away so yes it is. Clicker training seems to be the easiest way to teach tricks such as these. There are many clicker books and sites online plus classes. You can teach a dog anything he is physically able to do, you just have to be smart enough to figure out how to train it. My youngest dobe is trained to pick up the MinPins' dog dishes after they are done and bring them to me at the sink to wash. German Shepherds are, IMHO, the most veratile breed, they do police work, lead the blind, herd sheep, find lost people, find gas leaks and also fetch shot ducks. I have owned several GSDs and they always did well in the obed rings. Plus they trained very quickly. |`|Ai8NrXB8aa	German Shepherd? Yes,  you can sure do it.|`|9Y56hQRlaa	yes its possible but its a lot of training but it'll pay off in the end.|`|2iRkXJ4oaa	First walk him over to the basket and tell him drop-it. Then once he gets used to that put a word with it, say like "Basket" then walk over with him and then say drop it. Slowly stop going with him, like don't go all the way there with him.<br>  <br>  Soon he should be accustom to going over and dropping the toy in the basket whenever you say "Basket" Or whatever your word may be :)|`|DU0F48B3aa	yes my three dogs are they are a standard poodle, shiba inu, and a golden mix|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Better yet, teach them to play with their toys in the toy basket.<br>  <a href="http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/blunderpic/dogs/Picture029.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i396.photobucket.com/albums/pp43/...</a>|`|K8t1lPXsaa	if you show him what to do like you did with regular obedience and make it into a game it can be easy. i refer to all my dogs toys as a 'chew' i'll tell them go get the chew. they'll run for the closest toy and i'll say go put it in your box. a little stow away container. they rush towards the box and plunk it in there. when they come back they get a treat. sometimes they get a little too excited and miss the box or it falls out and still try to get the treat. so i tell them again to go put it in their box and they'll usually get it right the second time if they didn't get it right the first time.in the beginning you should reward any attempt to put the toy away whether it misses or falls out.<br>  <br>  i have a rottie/shepherd mix, pit, husky and a yorkie and they can all do it
4aAhEK9daa	Weruva and Tiki Cat - another very good canned food brand - both process foods in Thailand but with human-grade ingredients in human-grade factories.  Read the labels or check the info on their site.   The foods that were recalled because of melanine in them were those with inferior pet-grade ingredients and processed in China.  If you look at the list of brands that were recalled it was all brands you'd find at the grocery store or WalMart.<br>  <br>  My cats are NUTS for Paw Lickin' Chicken.  Penny, my Exotic, will lick the plate completely clean!|`|FC34jxiaaa	The pet food recalls, from what I understand, were the result of contaminated vegetable proteins (wheat gluten, etc.) Those are nasty ingredients anyway, so I wouldn't feed any food that contains them. But I don't worry quite as much about where a food is made. My cat mostly eats EVO, but I do give her one cat treat that is packaged in China (made from Alaskan salmon).<br>  <br>  I haven't purchased any Weruva products, but I know they *claim* that their pet foods are fit for human consumption. Personally, if the cat really loves it, then I would probably keep feeding it.

He probably did not announce his need to potty this morning because he was not crated, therefore could go potty somewhere, and not have to lie in it.

If you wish to leave him out of the crate, get him a litter box and train him to potty in that.  <br>  When he is older and potty trained, assuming he can be potty trained, he should be fine.

Also make sure you know how to contact your vet during the holidays in case your dog breaks his stitches.  Get an after hour number you can call, for example, my current vet you have to call twice before they pick up the phone after hours, so if there are any things you need to know, make sure you find out.

BwIBMDfLaa	a terrier is defenitley not the way to go then.  they are hyper loud and crazy.  you have to have lots of energy and patience to care for one.  <br>  <br>  and an older dog would be a great idea.  go to a local shelter, the older ones need homes more than the babies.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	look on petfinder.com type in your zip code.<br>  terriers are a handful,no matter what size.<br>  the calmest,but rarest terrier is the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.maybe look on petfinder, if there are any Dandies are available?<br>  Beagles can be a handful too and some are very vocal:howling when excited or bored.|`|NlvghuIkaa	Terriers are full of energy. <br>  <br>  They are attention wanting and tend to dig when bored. Sure they are small, but in reality, they act bigger than they are. Barking and snapping is quite common along with heel nipping and the like.<br>  <br>  I would say Spaniel for sure<br>  <br>  You said you want a calm dog, not so full of energy. I have only really had experience with owning spaniels but they are excellent dogs. At the moment I own a  Springer and yes, he is full of energy. <br>  <br>  Before Loki, we had a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. He was clam, and very lazy. Always ready to go walking but alwyas happy to follow you around the house.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would do some serious research on the little Cavalier :)|`|jKDZlgMiaa	Terriers tend to be territorial and will bark their heads off. <br>  <br>  I have a rat terrier and I adore the bejeebers out of her but I'm about to get a muzzle for her. I've tried training her but she still freaks out and barks every single time someone comes to the door or if someone in the family approaches me. <br>  <br>  I'd do a lot of research online and maybe ask a vet. My bf became something of a dog expert just by doing that and we've ended up with an awesome choc lab. <br>  |`|dWed21jUaa	def. not a terrier. They're packed full of energy and don't seem to ever stop. I'd go for 2 hr hikes, play games, etc with mine and he'd still be jumping off the friggin walls.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i have a yorkie along with a rottie/shepherd mix, pit and a husky. he's the youngest out of the bunch but indoors he's definitely the calmest. really i find most terriers to be pretty lazy indoors. outdoors is a completely different story though. very excited outdoors, always looking for things to chase and very inquisitive. they are fast so you'll have to be on your toes. he barks when there is someone at the door or when he's "telling" on one of the other dogs. that's it. <br>  <br>  he has a very high pitched bark though which can probably be more annoying. when they want your attention they will make sure they get it. they learn basic commands easily but housebreaking is a big problem with most terriers. i know you're planning on getting an older dog but that could still wind up being a big problem. be prepared to  invest in belly bands. |`|yKEnTWrUaa	Terriers are very active (sometimes hyperactive) and friendly, while spaniels tend to be calm but need your company less. So if you can handle a 'crazy' dog who will be your really good friend, go for a terrier. I'd recommend a Jack Russell Terrier, I have one and I love him!|`|58bwiRufaa	Hmm, American Cocker Spaniels have been terribly overbred and have a tendency to neuroticism and biting (not true of English Cockers, which are harder to find--esp in a shelter situation). Other spaniels (like the Clumber or Field) are ok, but are harder to find. Terriers are LOADED with energy. Beagles can be barky and tend to roam. Have you considered a small herding breed, like a Corgi? Or maybe a mini poodle? Poodle mixes are very popular and are usually pretty smart and trainable.<br>  <br>  As you said, shelter dogs are usually mixes and it's often hard to tell of just what. ;) Have you considered a breed rescue? There are rescue groups for every breed imaginable, and you can usually find an older dog in need of a home. Look online for dog breeds to determine your mom's compatibility (for example, does she plan to exercise the dog a lot, does she want to do a lot of grooming, etc.), then go from there. You can even look up rescue groups online and any reputable breed rep will give you the skinny (both good and bad) about the dog you are considering. There are hundreds of breeds out there and such research can be fun (and necessary for a dog you plan on spending up to 14 years with).<br>  <br>  And don't rule out just visiting shelters and letting that one mixed breed speak to you and steal her way into your heart. 
fYT2kOhqaa	What about a gargoyle gecko? Those are very cool to look at and play with. Unfortunately because you don't have a very big cage you can't have animals that will get very big unless you want to pay for a whole new tank.<br>  Frogs,Geckos, and some turtles are good ideas for your size tank. There are some smaller lizards that you could keep but none like the Bearded or iguanas.<br>  <br>  Edit: I think a Kenyan Sand Boa would be a fine idea.|`|af7bjTa9aa	If you are planning on getting a bigger tank, then go for a breaded dragon. another pretty cool lizard is a sand fish, their pretty fun too.

bIaywrBCaa	my chihuahuas love their doggy door and it is the easiest tool I have found in housebreaking. My pups by 3 months old are going out to potty. Get the smallest door. It will be just right.<br>  <br>  My dogs love it also because they can go in and out and play when they want to. Even on the coldest days this winter, you can find them out in the backyard running around. Not for long periods but they do enjoy going out when they want.<br>  <br>  It should be used with a fenced yard. I wouldn't allow the dogs free run if my yard wasn't fenced. We have a wooden privacy fence that the dogs cannot dig under or jump over it.<br>  <br>  They come with a magnet on the bottom to hold the flap closed but we had to remove it because the dogs wouldn't use it with the magnet on. The flap still stays in place well without it.|`|r9wrDGm2aa	Housebreaking problems: I would put the Chihuahua on my Top 10 List of "Hard to Housebreak." Consistent crate training is mandatory. Sometimes a doggy door is necessary. And some owners never do get their Chihuahua fully housebroken.  They are hard to housebreak but its a must with chihuahuas so take the effort to teach him to go in and out of it. A small one would do as long as its not too small for her to get in and out of comfortably.|`|giCUEYsJaa	First, look into getting a cat door.  They're smaller and cheaper.<br>  <br>  We've had doggie doors, but I wouldn't recommend them.<br>  <br>  My dog actually got stuck in our doggy door and hurt her neck so badly we had to take her to the vet.<br>  <br>  We never used the doggy door again.<br>  <br>  Your dog is small enough you can train her to use a litter box.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Dog doors come in a array of sizes.<br>  Yes, you will have to train your dog to use it.<br>  I just hope you have an area that your dog can not escape or wander off from if your not monitoring your dog outside with the use of a dog door.<br>  I have one but my backyard is completely fenced.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|SbLeCOjZaa	Is your yard completely fenced in? Does your dog dig?|`|NEWbh3Plaa	I would only suggest a doggie door if you have a fenced in yard with a lock on it.  Believe it or not a doggie door is a great way for burglars to get into you house and if you only have a "7 lb chihuahua" for protection you might be in trouble!  Also with a dog that small the door itself is going to have to be made of lightweight material so that she can push through it.  Not to mention that she might be scared to even attempt it.  Im not sure how to test it without actually installing the door.  Maybe you know someone who has one and you could try that?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|W20KslFzaa	One thing to keep in mind...if your dog can get in and out, so can other animals that can fit through the door.<br>  <br>  I think they work well, if you have a large enough dog that would keep any local animals out.  But a 7 pound chihuahua wouldn't keep out much of anything.  <br>  <br>  If you're only worried about her using it, just stand on the other side with a treat and entice her to come through with that.  Once she knows how it works, she'll use it.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	I love them, it's so much easier.  Almost any dog will use it so that's not a problem.  You just have to show them how.  Put her outside and hold the flap open a tiny bit and call her.  Let her come up to it and push it with her nose then let go so she comes in by herself.  She'll get used to it and understand what she's supposed to do.  Small or extra small should be good.  Don't go too big or she won't be strong enough to open it.<br>  <br>  P.S.  This is only if you have a fence, I wouldn't recommend it for a free roaming dog.|`|JMnu0rBiaa	I didn't install the one in my back door, since it was there when we moved in. But, your dog -will- use it, my dog, my roomates dog, and even my cat use it. I'd say get like a 1 1/2 - 2 Ft. Door. And if you don't want anything coming in or going out, you can put the little panel over it.<br>  Best of luck.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Depends on your area...<br>  <br>  Owls or hawks or other raptors will carry away a dog as small as yours.  <br>  <br>  Also, is she spayed?

You don't have to get up and let the dog out during the most dramatic part of the tv show or movie. You don't have to wake up to let the dog out. You don't have to worry about accidents while you're at work if the dog is left inside or bad weather if the dog is left outside. <br>  There are a few great scenarios for you to consider. If you have a door that leads to the back yard from the garage, that one is a great one to have the dog door on because then the dog can just stay in the garage but get out when she needs to. That way the cold air that may escape in will only effect the garage. <br>  Or, if you have a sliding glass door, then you can just get one of the doors that goes to that so it makes for easy set up and take down in casee the dog doesn't like it. <br>  As far as what size. Currently, you only need a small cat sized door. But if you want to get a larger dog some day or if you welcome friends bringing their larger dogs around, you may want something a little bigger. <br>  Be sure to get a door that has a plate so you can close it off. If you know you don't want the dog in or out for any reason, you can slide the plate in and it closes that door. <br>  <br>  As I'm sure you're reading, only get one if your yard is fenced so your dog won't wonder off and it will help prevent other animals from getting in. However, in the many years I've lived with dog doors, only one cat came inside the house and that was after the dog died (no one to chase the cats out of the yard anymore). Or, if you are really concerned about that, you can get the sensored dog doors where a chip in the collar opens the door for the pet. I've never owned one of those, but they seem useful if you live in a highly pet populated area.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|510MC9SVaa	There are doggy doors that the dog wears a collar that opens the door. This protects you from having stray dogs or people comming into your house through the doggy door. As for which size, when you go to the store, tell them the size of the dog and they will get you the right size door.<br>  Once you have the door and have it installed, all you have to do is train the dog to use the door. Once they are trained they will love the freedom of being able to come and go as they wish.|`|BFmZq29Qaa	You might try leaving the door open and see what she does (when the weather calms down).<br>  <br>  I think doggie doors can go either way.  I would not get one for me because I would not like the idea of other animals making use of them or providing someone easier access to my home.... I also have this thing about electric bills and extra holes in doors.  I dont care how tight you seal things, they just seem like more hassle than they are worth.<br>  <br>  Your dog, however, might love that freedom.  Plus, if you cant jostle home right away, fido will be able to do it fido's way on fido's time!|`|btgxidCUaa	only get one if you have a fence around your house. you want to make sure that your dog doesn't run away. the door should be pretty small since your dog is small and make sure its a size where a human cannot fit through. you should also get a lock on it to make sure your dog cannot go out when you don't want her to. there are ways to train a dog to use the door..i'm not sure of them but you could google or ask a vet or pet store. she also may just use it herself through curiosity|`|c6c85b646236492bfffb8c6214e77406aa	if you have a fenced in yard- a doggie door is so liberating for both you abnd your dog. they can go out as soon as they need to go weather you are home or not. no more worrying about potty on the floor. she will deffinately use it once she figures it out. make sure when you get it you lift the door from the opposite side she is on and call her over maybe with a treat. she will get the idea in no time|`|BjNFtk0Caa	She'll use it eventually. Just make sure you show her what it does. Pros: No mess in the house<br>  Cons: Pawprints in house...She can also get loose if given enough time left alone...<br>  <br>  I'd just get a standard cat door for her. I have a Jack Russel and he uses the cat door just fine.<br>  <br>  I say get it. It gives them something to do other than tear up the house when you're not home<br>  <br>  MAKE SURE YOUR YARD is doggie proofed too. Cover up any holes and pick up anything you don't want her chewing on|`|v5o6NZxRaa	i found that having a doggie door lets your relax a little if your yard is fenced in and is tall. maybe your dos has to go to the bath room during the middle of the night then it wont wake you up. it is very convenient. if the dog is 7lb. and  small i would get a 1-2 ft. door.|`|9rImqrdsaa	I would! <br>  I think there's a pretty good chance of her using it, especially if you work with her a little with it in the beginning.<br>  If, at first she seems a little unsure about it, you sit on one side with a treat and call her from the other side. <br>  She'll get the hang of it!|`|kmO1wgQGaa	NOT TO DO!!! Never get one. I had one before and my dog just couldn't handle it. My friend doesn't like them either.|`|AA10720479	I have a doggie door, and think it's great. You never have to open the door to let them out. I would advise that you have some kind of small fenced in area so no critters can get in.  My chihuahua is 9 lbs and I have the small door. It is well worth it. They can go out side when you're not home and relieve them selves. I don't know what I would do with out one. As far as if you dog will go out using the door, you will have to put the dog in your hands the first few times to  show it that it can get out. After they realize they can go out on there own, you're all set. I have never had one accident since I put the door in.

XurYYreBaa	Ferrets are sweet, charming & very playful, like kittens who never grow up.  When they're real happy or excited they do this wild sideways dance, which actually intimidates some ppl the 1st time they see i.<br>  It was quick & easy to teach our ferret not to play-nip.  Every time she'd nip, I'd say "no" firmly & the game would immediately stop for a while.  Although I handled her the most often I made sure that everyone who interacted with her did the same thing.  She learned in less than 2 weeks that biting=no more play & she was still quite young so she never hurt anyone.<br>  Good luck with your ferret this Christmas.|`|CEChcfKwaa	Ferrets are so much fun but they can be a handful. They do nip but usually in play and I've never had one break the skin but their teeth are sharp so it's always a possibility. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to get a young one and handle it often so it is very tame.<br>  <br>  I let mine loose to play but beware, they can fit into the tiniest of holes and gaps and they love to explore everything so they can be hard to find when they disappear. Letting them out to play means tracking them down when you're ready to put them back because they don't sit still for a minute.<br>  <br>  I love my ferrets. They make me smile and laugh with their playfulness and funny little actions and noises. Just don't expect them to be trainable or as affectionate as a dog, although they do show affection.<br>  <br>  |`|4dntstR9aa	Ferrets are a lot like cats.

And, it can hurt.  But, you can break them of it and they will grow out of it.<br>  <br>  They are more like hyper little dogs.  They are FUNNY!  You can let it out on your bed, but they are extremely nosy and adventurous and it will get down.  We have a room with a door on it (nothing in the room that he can get hurt on) and we just turn him loose and let him run and play.  There are different toys you can buy then to play with at pet shops and online.  Mine likes balls really well.  They like to "wrestle" your hands and feet to play.  Some can be trained to walk on a leash like a dog (mine always gets off of his, so I quit).<br>  <br>  They are tons of fun and I am sure you will love him/her!  But, if you get a chance, get two of them.  They really like having a playmate and companion.  Not that they need one, they just prefer it.  <br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy your new pet!  We sure love ours!|`|DZEH63wsaa	They like to play nip.<br>  <br>  Take to vet to get rabies, and ferret distemper. <br>  <br>  <br>  They are known for getting caught in cords, they are very smart they know how to get into stuff. So baby proof your house before letting them roam around free. They can easily eat anything.<br>  |`|biA2bvwfaa	It will all depend on the personality of your ferret, so make sure to choose carefully. I've known a couple of people with ferrets and they took them out to the park (Might not be advisable because I don't know exactly what would happen, again depends on the personality). All in all they are nice pets to have, very playful.<br>  <br>  Hope it goes good for you<br>  Ryan|`|sP4KSFvQaa	Ferrets are great pets. They need socialisation like any baby animal.<br>  They can bite or nip. They nip when they play but they may bite if they feel threated. <br>  I live with two. They nip occassionally but don't bite at all. My husband loves ferrets. The first one entered our home after I broke down and got her for my husband for Christmas.  After a while and some handling(30 minutes every night with some tapping to the nose gently if it nips).. Two years later...we got another! Yes we did!! The bigger male is actually a big cotton ball. If we place him on the floor he follows us around the house with the two dogs leading the way.<br>  The first one is emotionally sensitive and needs reassurance from my husband(he's her parents).<br>  It really depends upon the temperment of the ferret. Be sure to handle it daily.<br>  Have fun!! 
d2nbgWz4aa	Try taking the her outside and letting her pee on the grass. She possibly could like the grass because its nice and comfy for her feet.Give her lots of praise and treats if she does pee. After, play with her outside or take her for a walk. Keep doing this and she might associate that if she pees outside she gets lots of praise, treats and a walk full of adventures!|`|K8t1lPXsaa	she should learn by example. having two dogs show her the way will usually be much easier than you trying to teach her alone. go out frequently with her and the other two dogs so she gets the idea. praise her when she does her business. <br>  <br>  if she absolutely refuses to go on anything but the pads then place the pads by the door you use to let them out. keep it placing them there for a day or two. then start placing a few in the grass. once she consistently uses the pads outside you should be fine to take the pads away|`|hbiKKm7Taa	She should learn through example however you will have to treat her like a puppy learning to use grass. <br>  One of the things that you can do if she is reluctant to use the grass is put her wee-pad on the grass. The fold it smaller and smaller until it is tiny, then remove it. <br>  <br>  Remember to give her chance to unlearn a habit that has been in place for over 3 years. Practice patience and persistence and you and your dog will definitely get it right.
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	The first step is you learning how to teach a dog.<br>   Do you have a Rottweiler and a Pit Bull? |`|K8t1lPXsaa	it depends on what you mean by training and how old your dog is. if it's a puppy start of with basic training, sit, lay down, stay, come. etc. make sure it gets a LOT of socialization around kids, other dogs,and anything else that may make it nervous later. loud/strange noise, car rides. make sure it walks well on a leash and doesn't pull you. depending on the age if it pulls invest in a prong collar. <br>  <br>  i would suggest you take the dog to at least 1 obedience class. socialization and obedience is the biggest thing with these breeds. they need to learn early on how to listen to your commands and not acting to new situations in a fearful or aggressive state of mind|`|2sOOgiWBaa	What kind of training specifically...?|`|AyJ3xXgYaa	first step is getting a crate i would guess if you want to potty train
2sOOgiWBaa	Yorkies have a weird temperament and dogs in general get weird in the evenings. My puppy gets all riled up at night for the same reason kids do, they don't wanna go to bed and they go nuts trying to stay awake and keep your attention on them.<br>  <br>  Also, he might actually be jealous of the attention you give your husband and son, that could be why he's like that with them and not with you. If your family time is in the evening this really might be the case.<br>  <br>  ADDITION: I really think its a jealousy thing, if he gets upset when your husband is on the bed, think about it, your dog knows that your husband gets affection in that bed and your doggy doesnt like it one bit! Dogs are really expressive animals, use the classic rocks in a water bottle shaker whenever he shows attitude.<br>  <br>  well you left the tail wagging part out haha, he's playing in his own strange little way, but you do need to break that thought process and he needs to realize its unacceptable...<br>  <br>  and he hides behind you because youre his mommy, youre his protector, if when my tiny jack russel puppy is playing with one of the foster dogs it gets too rough, he comes hopping to me and hides between my feet|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	that could be the reason he is aggressive as sometimes it can hurt the dog the next time use a water spray and see what that does sometimes that or a can with pennies in you can rattle the noise will shock him into stopping |`|K8t1lPXsaa	do you perhaps baby/spoil your yorkie a little too much? how does your hands/son react when the dog acts like that. are you anywhere nearby when the dog begins to act like that? an overly pampered dog can easily become territorial over one specific person. if you are in the area when he's acting like that then he's letting everyone else know that he doesn't want them getting too close to you. growling and snapping is not a tolerable behavior
K8t1lPXsaa	if the dog is being fed food with corn or wheat as an ingredient in it then it is very likely food allergies. the symptoms you described sound like allergies|`|AA12128656	the most common allergens in pet food are corn and soy. you might (with your vet's help) consider cutting these two things first.<br>  <br>  dont switch the dog to a new food right away, switch it gradually so that its stomach does not become more upset.<br>  <br>  i have an older lab mix who is a rescue dog and he is allergic to many different foods. he does well with lamaderm, which has no corn or soy and is lamb and rice based.<br>  <br>  some dogs can also be allergic to preservatives, so you might consider a raw diet.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Yes it could be a food allergy.   Finding out what she is allergic to is a process of elimination.  Corn is one of the most common allergies so you may want to start with a diet free of corn.  However the quickest thing to do is switch her to diet designed for dogs with allergies which have a unique meat and carb source such as herring, venison or kangaroo and sweet potato or oatmeal.  These formulas are available from many makers of premium and super premium dog foods.    |`|s76aC4G8aa	It could be the food.  chances are the dog is allergic to either Wheat, corn or soy.  Check the food you feed and look to see if it is full of grains such as Corn, corn gluten, wheat, wheat gluten, rice, soy protein etc.  If the food has those then chances are it's the food you are feeding so you would need to look for a food that is 100% allergen and grain free.  Examples of those foods are: Orijen, Solid Gold - Bark at the moon, Pinnacle Trout & Sweetpotato, Pinnacle Duck & Potato, Wellness Core, Artemis, Merrick, Timberwolf and The Honest Kitchen.<br>  <br>  compare your food to others at www.dogfoodanalysis.com and see where it rates.  It will take a month or more for you to notice a difference so don't be quick to change again after only 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  also you can have them tested at the vets to see if it is food allergies.  I know of a dog that is allergic to everything BUT food so try that first and see how she goes after about a month or so.  If still the same then chances are it's not food, but it's the cheapest way to start eliminating what the problem might be.|`|lmSffrNuaa	Allergies are caused by an immune system that overreacts to an everyday substance, such as fleas, pollen, or a certain food. The three most common culprits.<br>  <br>  1.  Atopic dermatitis is genetic. An affected dog inherits a tendency to develop skin problems from pollens, grasses and trees, dust mites, or mold spores. <br>  2.  Flea allergy - an allergy to blood-sucking fleas--or rather, to their saliva--is the single most common skin disease in dogs.<br>  3.  Food allergy - dogs can be allergic to several types of food, but the most common triggers are chicken, beef, corn, or wheat--all typical ingredients in commercial dog food.<br>  <br>  A visit to the vet is in order if you spot these allergy warning signs:<br>      * Frequent scratching, licking, and chewing<br>      * Recurring skin or ear infections<br>      * Red, thick, or flaky skin<br>      * Hair loss<br>      * Chronic stomach upset<br>      * Reverse sneezing (sounds a bit like the dog is inhaling sneezes) <br>  <br>  Treatment plans vary depending on the allergy, but they usually involve medication, managing the environment to remove the allergen, or both.

gz5O9Tbpaa	Dont leave them alone together. My mother's GSD used to do the same mouth thing with my yorkie. It does take time and a LOT of training, but it can happen... everyone can live together in harmony. I know you have the urge to pick up the yorkie to protect it, but that doesn't help anything. Leave the yorkie on the ground and discipline the GSD. Even if you have to use a leash on him all the time. He will soon learn he doesn't get anywhere when he's harassing the yorkie.<br>  <br>  But on a side note... you have a 10 month old yorkie that's only 1lb??? Why would you do that????<br>  <br>  Added: um... yeah... because the yorkshire terrier is in the toy dog breed category... all yorkies are considered a toy breed. Perhaps you are confused...|`|K8t1lPXsaa	the easiest way to end this is by making your gsd respect your yorkie and end any dominance challenge. which means you set the pecking order so they don't have to set it out amongst themselves. it's not uncommon for the smallest dog to be the dominant dog. but others base it on seniority. i have a rottie/shepherd mix, pit, husky and a yorkie. the dominance goes in the that order from oldest to youngest. the bigger dog has to learn how to safely play with the dog. <br>  <br>  try holding the yorkie and having the gsd sit next to you. have the gsd sniff the yorkie and say something like gentle. set the yorkie down and see how they interact. if the gsd gets too rough say gentle. if she keeps up the rough housing make her lay down. this will be something that all of you have to get used to. my big dogs had to learn what was acceptable behavior around the yorkie. it does take a while. there are no quick fixes. most little dogs don't really seem to realize they're so little so they don't usually mind trying to stand up to the big dog. unfortunately this can get it hurt. <br>  <br>  at the same time don't let your yorkie get away with murder. hold the yorkie accountable as well. i noticed my yorkie would try to act like top dog and boast a little after the bigger dogs were made to lay down so that contributed to the problem as well. so sometimes the yorkie brought it upon himself. so that was hard for the big dogs too. they had to learn they don't get to give out corrections, i do. <br>  <br>   i would not use the crate to send the dog to when it acts up like the op suggested. a crate should be a good experience for the dog. also because your yorkie is so small it is a lot more fragile which means you really have to keep an eye out. my yorkie is slightly above standard at 7.5 pounds, a half pound and 1 inch above standard. that did make it somewhat easier on my part because just accidents can cause injury. my rottie/shepherd accidentally rolled over on my yorkie in his sleep and the yorkie yelped but he was ok. that could be deadly for a dog your size.|`|juU6nJqUaa	It sounds like you need to take a lesson from Ceasar.  You need to become the dominant leader in your household and not allow the shepherd to control the yorkie.  <br>  <br>  Put the shepherd in her crate everytime for about 10 minutes, if she continues to be a bully.  She will get the idea if you don't allow her to trap the smaller dog.<br>  <br>  Calmly correct your dog every single time!  Never laugh when she does this.  She needs to see the humans as in charge and she needs to KNOW that you won't tolerate her bullying.
AA12083992	Our pets need quality pet food. Read the ingredients list and learn what the stuff on there is and what it does (or does not do) to/for our pets. A quick pet food 101. If the pet food contains corn/corn products or by products it is a poor quality food. Corn is a filler that can trigger skin problems. (allergies, skin problems, itching and excessive shedding) By products is anything from an animal not fit for human consumption, including cancerous tissue. Do not pay attention to advertising, they all say there food is great. "Vet approved" means they have a vet on staff to approve their product. In other words, someone paid to approve it. Same with foods most vets recommend. Salesmen "gift" vets then the vet recommends the food. Most vets are not nutritionists! Quality foods have meat as the first ingredient. Wellness, Solid Gold, Innova and Merrick are a few of the best brands available.

Since yours is an older pup, adult food for small breeds should be fine. Take time to educate yourself on dog food brands, because most of the stuff on the market, is a bunch of junk not suitable for dogs to eat. The majority of dog foods contain corn, which is no good for dog's nutrition and some dogs (like mine) develop digestive problems with foods high in corn and flour. Find a food that has the first ingredient with a meat (not a meat meal, you never know what they put in those). Stay away from Walmart and other department stores, they sell a bunch of junk (Ol Roy, Walmart's brand, is terrible). Petsmart is great (if you have one in your area). Blue Buffalo, Nature's Recipe, Taste of the Wild, Canide, and Pro Plan are all great starts.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	Any good quality puppy food.

8NSh1D4Maa	I always opt for bloodwork, just to be on the safe side, but it would be rare for a young dog to have a problem that made surgery dangerous.  I would personally have my vet do the bloodwork, then have the SPCA do the neuter procedure.  A neuter is a very simple procedure and the dog is under for a limited amount of time.  Complications would be unusual.  |`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	The SPCA is a great place to get a dog neutered if you are trying to save money. They use qualified vets and have a lot of experience, but due to the low cost, they just can't dedicate the same amount of servicesand time to your pet. For instance, in a vet's office, the dog would likely get IV fluids and pain injections that they would not get at the SPCA. <br>  It's just a matter of preference.....do you want to save a bit of money or do you want all the extras. If your dog is healthy then the extras aren't all that necessary but it is nice if you can afford it. Neither way is a bad way to go though.|`|ac92f82f4d5b3f3af2d01d0117d482cbaa	$95.00 sounds good to me.<br>  ADD: A veterinarian does the neuter at the SPCA also.|`|AA10990734	Lets just say this - you get what you pay for.  What drugs are used, what equipment is used, what monitoring is used (EKG, SPO2, blood pressure, IV fluids, etc).  What sterile field is used (some doc don't where gowns and some don't drape in patients which increases risk of infection).  What staff are assisting or monitoring your pet?  Some one who has a license like an RVT or CVT, or someone who was just promoted from being a receptionist and has no idea what a linea alba is.  Ask your vet what is involved and ask to see the facility and see what you feel comfortable with.  <br>  <br>  Some shelters and humane societies are able to run really nice spay/neuter clinics due to county and state funding if you live where having your pet altered is required.  Some places where this is not required, have to skimp to get by. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't choose by money alone.  Get recommendations or ask around.  And go with your intuition.  If you think you can't trust them, then don't go there.  It you think everything will be okay, then go with it.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	 a vets office will always charge you more. do it at the spca. they have the same credentials to do the procedure as your vet. they make it low cost so that more dogs are able to get spayed and neutered. sometimes they ask for a small donation fee- like an extra five bucks. i got my dogs neutered at a local low cost spay and neuter clinic like the spca and they did low cost 1 year rabies shots for $5 bucks  |`|bPgvMO98aa	$95 sounds good to me too.  There might even be an organization in your area that will offer a coupon or voucher to help you save even more.  It's worth a couple minutes of googling to find out.|`|4VhVIM2Taa	$309.00 seems kinda high. I paid $274.00 about 6 months ago. But no blood work was required. Not sure why they are wanting the blood work. I have been going to this same vet for many years. I say check around to the clinics and other vets. The dog goes in in the morning and you pick him up that night, they are a little drowsy and wants to rest. You have to make sure they don't over lick or scratch the area. And they have to not rough house or anything for  about a week. Even with me being with this vet for years, I still shopped around for the prices. I would say the SPCA is just as safe as the vet. GOOD LUCK!!|`|MjO10LbRaa	400 bucks seems outrageous, would you pay that for a procedure for yourself if you could get it for 1/4 of the price else where? <br>  I thought what my vet charged was the top of what i would want to pay, I got it easy!|`|610456f280f1b8dd6671473b7857e7e7aa	My dog was neutered at a low cost spay/neuter clinic for $25.

OUq8Wi9saa	When my first hamster died, I was pretty upset because my mom said I couldn't bury it and I just had to put it in a shoe box (tie it closed) and threw it out. I was pretty upset about that for a long while, so I don't advise just throwing it out!<br>  <br>  When my second hamster died, I put her in a kleenex box and went outside and buried her. I took a small shovel and sort of cut a piece of the grass and pulled it up, then dug the hole and put the kleenex box inside. I filled the hole and then simply placed the grass back over it. You can hardly see the lines were I peeled the grass back unless you know where to look.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped!

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I agree with you that it was probably due to stress.  I'm sure going to the groomers and being handled by people they don't know is very stressful for dogs.  She was probably too stressed to pee until she settled down.<br>  <br>  I groom my two small dogs myself now.  They were getting stressed out at the groomers.

I KNOW this sounds like it might be "Stretching it" alittle... -But little Dogs get VERY "Dependent" on their Masters... And it can be VERY Upsetting to them- psychologically- to be "abandoned" someplace- and have NO idea WHAT's "going on"- or IF you're ever coming BACK !!!  :o   So give her alittle extra "attention"- the next few days, to reassure Her, and She should be Fine ...  :)|`|gAOAdOHraa	Oh sh*t call the cops...I mean come on she is 8, not a spring chicken anymore and accidents do happen, get over it.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	I would say she was upset and nervous and when she got home she calmed down and it just accidently happened.<br>  <br>  Petco sells these pills called NaturVet Quiet Moments..they are all natural and work on the nervous system to calm the dog before stressful events.<br>  I have not tried them yet but i want to.

She could also be making a point to you that she is upset that she had to go to the doctors, or maybe another dogs scent was masking her bed and she wanted rid of it, so she peed to get her own scent on it.  Another thing could be that she has a bladder infection and she can't control it.  I hope shes feeling better soon!  I would say take her back to the vet if it occurs again.|`|Z0PqY7soaa	Maybe she just had to go to the bathroom lol. one time my dog threw up  in the dining room for like no reason.. and my friend's dog just pooped on the floor because it was like hyper|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Dogs get very stressed at the Groomer's.  <br>  So more than likely the reason she did that was just caused by stress from her traumatic experience.|`|AA11314631	She probably drank too much water at the groomers or was having an "anxiety" dream about being there earlier that day.|`|Hjny2ducaa	If she was stressed they hold there potty then when they are in a safe place and they can relax then they pee and poop|`|JCNEP903aa	I still groom clients that have special needs due to age, health, and  behavioral problems. But, I have alot of clients that I do because there were signs of abuse from the previous groomer. Check to see if she has any bruising . The psychological damage they can do is horrifying. I have scars on my arms and hands from bites from groomer abuse victims that I am VERY HAPPY to report that they now get all excited (the good way) when their owners bring them to me it's supposed to be nice for them, too These dogs need extra care and tenderness their trust has been broken. It's supposed to be a day at the spa for them|`|YVS53aksaa	Yes, sometimes dogs can be so scared that they will try not to release any emotion. They may be so scared/stressed that they will not relieve themselves for a couple of hours. Blossom may had waited a little too long, and once she calmed down she needed to go to the bathroom. At that time she was on her bed, and may have still been too shaken to get up to give you a hint. You shouldn't worry about this though, she should calm down and go back to normal. Just make sure that your dog has a chance to use the restroom before you bring her in for the night.
AA11166069	PARVO is a gastro disease that mainly infect pups 2yr or younger. symptoms are loss of appetite, being lethargic, diorria, is extremely dangerous and needs immediate medical attention.|`|AA12285725	My puppy recently got over parvo. He was one sick little puppy. Diarrea, wouldnt eat, dry heave, I mean you name it. Its very serious and I suggest that anyone who has a dog with unusual symptoms like such, should get their little one to the vet. It is a dangerous desease that not only affects your dog painfully, but can kill him. I am just glad that we caught my puppies parvo soon. He is doing much better now, and plays like you wouldnt beleive.|`|AA10194187	I've been volunteering at the Humane society this summer, and just yesterday a dog came in who had the systems for palvo.  he wouldn't respond to movement, was emotionless, was found with a puddle of blood surrounding him, he drank a little bit of water, but wouldn't eat.  he came out positive.  problem though, the test that they gave him usually takes about 10 min.  but it only took 4 1/2 min.  for it to come out positive.  its untreatable, like a virus.  you can help the systems, but not the disease itself.  its very dangerous, it can kill a dog, if not found out right away. and its very contagious, if another dog was in the same room, he would most likely get it too.  humans can't get it, but it spreads rapidly with dogs.

K8t1lPXsaa	yorkies are extremely stubborn when it comes to potty training you might want to reconsider crate training. it's only to help regulate their small bladders because it goes against a dog's nature to pee where they sleep.<br>  <br>   I got my yorkie at 14 wks so he didn't need to go out as much as younger puppies. i crate trained my yorkie and even still it was hard at first but now he uses it like a little den and it's only whenever he wants to. sometimes he chills out in there when he wants to get away from the other dogs.<br>  <br>  the biggest thing is to keep at it. don't get discouraged. set up a schedule and take them out often. stick to the schedule as closely as possible. i'm not sure where you're getting your dog from but if it's from a breeder most responsible breeder won't let it go before 10 wks just for developement purposes. around this age they should go out 5-6 times to avoid accidents at minimum. <br>  <br>  if you are very against crate training i would suggest a puppy play pen to avoid making messes everywhere. you can line it with newspaper or puppy wee wee pads. make sure you invest in a good pet stain remover. remember don't reprimand the dog if you didn't see him doing anything, he won't know what he's being punished for<br>  <br>  yorkies are very energetic so you can use almost anything as a training tool. my yorkie responded very well to treats but not clickers because the sound scared him<br>  <br>  edit-crate training in the beginning is letting him get familiar with the crate. put a treat at the back and let him walk in to get it. don't close it the first time he goes in you just want to get him used to it. if he becomes whiny when you finally put him in then take a used shirt of yours and put it in with him. i had my yorkies crate in my room so i didn't have to do that. <br>  <br>  never leave a dog in a crate for more than four hours unless it's to go to sleep at night. cut off food and water around 7pm so they can sleep through the night. <br>  <br>  here is a site with additional info on crate training<br>  <a href="http://www.digitaldog.com/cratetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitaldog.com/cratetraining....</a><br>  <br>  here is a good site to help with learning tricks and commands <br>  <a href="http://www.bullwrinkle.com/training/dogtricks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bullwrinkle.com/training/dogt...</a>|`|wX3RzHaRaa	There is no easy way to potty train a Yorkie other then crate training it.

xwUzmMsKaa	from the sounds of i think u need to start a puppy class. training should start day one. huskys are not as trainable as someother breeds they are more thinkers. she's still young so she's gonna explore there are many thing for her to learn she picks up a rock remove it and tell her no...and teach 'GIVE". take her out more. u have to catch her pottying on the floor. walk up firm NO and pick her up by the scruff of the neckhold under her butt (most pups stop what ever they are doing if u pick them up like this) set her down outside. she should finishig peeing. also if hse poops in side place it out side so she smells it out there. <br>  <br>  let her out right after she eats, plays or takes a nap. lots of prasie for going out side. even a treat.|`|mU5wCI7Aaa	The best answer fro you is to go find a good obedience/schooling class.|`|2Gjqr7GVaa	bribe it with dog treats and speak really specifically and lots of love|`|AA10449254	I hope this excellent training article by Vivian Bregman helps!<br>  <br>  CIVILIZE YOUR DOG  by  Vivian Bregman<br>   <br>  For most dog owners the following three things are the most important for the dog to learn:<br>  <br>  1.  Housebreaking,<br>  2. Coming when called and<br>  3.  Walking on a leash without pulling.<br>  <br>  Everything else varies from owner to owner.<br>  <br>  The following are the most important things to remember when you start out to "Civilize Your Dog":<br>  <br>  1. NEVER tell your dog to do anything that he can evade. <br>  <br>  2. REWARD whatever you want the dog to continue doing while NOT REWARDING (or penalizing) whatever you want the dog to stop doing. <br>  <br>  These two statements will help you train the dog for the rest of his life.  Remember that rewards are not what YOU consider a reward, but rather, what the DOG considers a reward.  For example:  if your dog runs out the front door, he is being REWARDED with freedom.  When you call him and he comes and you put him back in the house he is being PENALIZED for coming to you by being put back in the house.  <br>  <br>  For training purposes a Reward can be verbal praise, petting, food, a ball or whatever motivates your dog.  YOU know your own dog -- you know if he would sell his soul for food or for a tennis ball.  Make his Reward whatever turns him on, and the time spent finding out what really turns him on will be well worth the effort.<br>  <br>  Please notice that I said "Penalize" and not punish.  Punishment makes people think of hitting the dog -- which is rarely necessary.  The only reason to hit a dog is for anti-social behavior.  "Anti-social" is not only biting.  A puppy that growls when you go near his bone is threatening you -- definitely anti-social behavior.  If not stopped it will probably become a bite.<br>  <br>  A "Penalty" can be anything that the dog does not like.  It may be a leash jerk, not moving when he's a on leash so there's no walk, or just ignoring him.<br>  <br>  If you think that your dog can't or won't learn, think about the things that he has already learned.  If you dog has been with you for a few weeks the chances are that he has learned when food is going to be available -- the sounds of the can opener or the opening of the closet door where his food is kept, or even, if he is fed from the table, to beg at dinner time. He has learned that a leash means a walk, that if the front door is left open a crack he can dash out and run for a few hours, and that when he is left alone he can destroy things in the house because he has never been caught in the act.<br>  <br>  One of the most important things for you to learn is that it IS possible to teach the dog what you want him to learn.  The dog is always learning.  You have to learn how to reward the dog so that it is in his best interests to do what you want him to do.<br>  <br>  If your dog is destructive when left alone, it is because he has not been caught in the act of doing wrong. <br>  <br>  If your dog dashes out the front door, it is because he has been given the opportunity to escape and then is being rewarded by the freedom to roam the neighborhood.  If this is your problem, put a ten foot rope on the dog and let him drag it around the house.  (called a house line)  Just before you open the door step on the rope, or, for a big dog, leave a loop in the end and loop it over the inside door handle.   <br>  <br>  When the dog dashes out the front door you have a handle with which to jerk him back in.  After a few times or a few dozen times (depending on the dog) he will catch on that it is painful to dash out the door and he will stop.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations!!  You have just taught your dog a lesson that *may* save his life, and *will*l save your hours of chasing.<br>  As long as he is dragging this rope around the house, if you have a problem with him jumping on people you can solve that too.  All you have to do is to step on the rope where it hits the floor.  If he jumps up, the rope tightens, giving him an automatic correction.  If he doesn't jump up, nothing happens.<br>  <br>  Every dog should have two names.  One for talking  TO him and one for talking ABOUT him.  If you use his name when you are talking about him you will desensitize him to the use of his name.  Every time you say his name make it a happy occasion for him.  Use his name when you feed him.  If you want to give him a snack, instead of saying "snack" say his name.  Every time I say my dog's name she thinks that I am saying "snack" and she comes running.  Much better than yelling "snack"  or "cookie" whenever I want her to come.  Much more dignified!!<br>  <br>  Most people have a life, aside from training the dog, so that I'm not going to tell you to train the dog for one hour a day.  Also, if you have a very young puppy one hour will be much too much for him.  Five or ten minutes at a time, two or three times a day will be far better to get the training into the dog's mind.<br>  <br>  One of the biggest problems is catching a dog thief in the act.  That is, a dog who steals food or other stuff off a table or a cabinet when you are not watching.  The trick is to catch him.  For this you will need several empty soda or beer cans.  When the cans are empty, wash and dry them.  When they are dry inside, put about ten pennies in the can and seal it with tape.  Line the cans up on the edge of a counter about six inches apart. Put a piece of food, or napkins, or whatever it is that he grabs off the table BEHIND the cans.  When the booby trap is all set up, leave the room, but stay within earshot.  When you hear the can hit the ground, come running in screaming.  DO NOT EVER SET THIS UP UNLESS YOU CAN COME RUNNING WHEN YOU HEAR THE CANS FALL.  Otherwise the dog will learn to spring the trap and get the bait.<br>  <br>  The purpose of obedience training is to teach your dog to be a well-mannered companion, who is responsive to your commands and who looks to you for leadership.  The process of training should be enjoyable for you both, and enhance the bond between you as well.<br>  <br>  How Dogs Learn<br>  Dogs learn by associating an action with a consequence.  If the consequence is pleasurable, the dog will tend to repeat the behavior.  If the consequence is unpleasant, he will tend not to repeat the behavior.<br>  <br>  In training you show your dog the action you wish, helping him to perform it by luring him with food or a toy, or by collar pressures.  When he performs the action, you immediately provide a pleasant consequence, by rewarding him with a special praise word and giving him a small treat. This is called "positive reinforcement," and will cause your dog, after several repetitions, to repeat the action.<br>  <br>  If you give your dog a command word at the same time that he performs the behavior, he will learn to associate the behavior with the command.<br>  <br>  For example, in order to teach your dog to sit, say the command SIT as you help him to do it.  This can be done by luring his head up with food or a toy held in your hand, which will cause his rear to sink into a sit, or by use of collar pressure coupled with the pressure of your hand on his rump.  The instant he sits, say his special praise word and give him a tiny treat.  After many repetitions of this he will make the association between the command word SIT and the act of sitting.  He will learn to obey the command by being positively reinforced by your praise word and a treat.<br>  <br>  Using A Special Word to Speed Learning<br>  You can speed up your dog's learning a lot by using a very special praise word reserved for the purpose of telling him that the action he is performing is correct and that he will be reinforced for it.  You can also use a "clicker" instead of a special word.  (Dolphin and killer whale trainers use a whistle for this purpose.  You've probably seen this at dolphin shows or on TV.  The whistle tells the dolphin that what he did was correct, and he can get a fish to eat.)  We suggest using a single word such as "great" or "yes" or "wow" that is different from general praise words like "good boy."<br>  <br>  You dog will first need to learn that this special sound, called a "conditioned reinforcer" means something.  Teach this at home by saying the word (or clicking your clicker if you are using one) and immediately giving the dog a tiny, succulent food treat.  The order is very important.  FIRST you say the word, THEN you give the treat.  Your dog shouldn't be doing anything special, just say the word and toss the treat.  After several repetitions of this you will see your dog startle and look at you when you say the word.  That means that he has learned that it means "a goodie is coming."  Now you can use your conditioned reinforcer to clearly tell him he has performed an action correctly and will be reinforced for it, with food, a toy, praise, play, or all three.<br>  <br>  In order for this to work, you must find something your dog likes and will work for that you can couple with your conditioned reinforcer.  For most dogs, tiny pieces of soft, tasty food work best.  We suggest tiny pieces of hot dog, cheese, soft-moist cat food, or lunch meat.  Buy a cheap belt pack to carry the food in when you are training and at class.  Once your dog has learned commands, you will not need to carry food, and can reinforce with praise, petting and play, but using food initially will help him learn much faster.<br>  <br>  Remember that your conditioned reinforcer must be given the instant the dog obeys your command and while he is still performing the behavior, and not several seconds later.  You will need to train him daily in order for commands to become part of his long-term memory.  <br>  <br>  He needs to be quiet and controlled while you are teaching him.  He can't learn if he is wildly excited or not paying attention to you.  Therefore, begin his training in quiet, familiar places, and add distractions later as he becomes proficient in his commands.<br>  <br>  As you start this obedience course, it will seem like there is a huge amount of things you need to learn and remember - new words, new ways of handling your dog, and new ways of relating to him.  Don't worry about trying to learn it all at once.  It will all be repeated over the weeks of the course and you'll find it becomes second nature as you gradually train your dog.  <br>  <br>  Just relax and have fun.<br>  <br>  And remember these three things that form the cornerstone of dog training:<br>  <br>  PATIENCE                        <br>  <br>  PRACTICE              <br>  <br>  PERSEVERANCE<br>  <br>  It should take a while to teach the dog all this stuff. I am being vague on purpose!! Don't panic if the dog doesn't seem to be catching on in one week.  Training takes time.  If you doubt that the dog is making any progress, keep a training diary.  This will help you see just how often you are training (once a week won't work) and you will be able to see that you ARE getting somewhere.<br>   <br>  Best of luck!|`|ZDSJ42Piaa	OK obedience classes, and try researching behavioral analysis training.  and I don't mean for dogs.  when you start to look into it you will notice alot of it pertains to children, but keep digging.  However, our dogs are like our children and alot of the same principles apply. it's all about positive reinforcements, and keeping a schedule.  Puppies need routine (just like children)  they need to know what to expect from you and what you expect from them.  Just keep doing the things you are doing and acknowledging your pup for the good things it does.   He/she will eventually learn what you want.

En el acuario come todo tipo de alimento granulado de peque?o diametro, escamas, alimentos liofilizados (larvas de mosquito, artemia, tubifex, etc). Pero por favor nunca le des tubifex pq contiene muchas enfermedades y bacterias q se las contagiaran a los peces!!!! Las larvas de mosquito les gustan mucho y son saludables!!!

Su alimento favorito son las larvas de mosquito, también les gustan mucho el tubifex (no son recomendables) las dafnias y las artemias. Además cabe recalcar que aceptan escamas sin ningún problema pero para que crezcan bastante y coloridos deben tener una dieta variada. <br>  <br>  <br>  suerte....|`|wTxTcZXqaa	alimento en ojuelas.. o puedes darle trocitos peque?os de acelga cocida... les gusta mucho...|`|91e27e9b223253549c2d05fb1c04d092aa	en las tiendas veterinarias  venden productos especificos para alimentar a los peces (pide para peces tropicales), son a base de harina de pescado y minerales, se les da muy poco una o dos veces al dia, no mas porque se hecha a perder tu agua con los desperdicios de comida. suerte|`|88ac09bebf3f6091dee462826b8f18ddaa	Pues normal como cualquier otro pez, dale hartemia ó tubi, tambien alimento seco..|`|e605fc3aa3e030315b03565e5768007caa	pues me imagino que cualquier otro pez<br>  <br>  o no se exactamente lo que sea un guppy

8f4e718f0cfa08e474b02fc5ffaa802baa	Un metodo que me funciona siempre es pasearlos de mano en mano, claro, a estas, sacarlos de la jaula o casa será dificil, y al principio cuando no tienes experiencia, te llevaras una o dos mordidas, no te enojes con ellos! lo unico que pasa es que defienden su territorio, y tu olor no es comun para ellos en ese momento. Asocia tu mano con algo agradable para ellos, un trozo de manzana, pan con miel, un pedacito de alegria o algo que no le des en su comida diaria. poco a poco veras que en cuanto vea tu mano se acercará a ti, y sacarlo para pasearlo será mucho mas facil.<br>  En cuanto a los hamsters chinos (enanos, rusos) su temperamento es mas enojon, asi que te recomiendo que uses un tubo de papel como conducto para sacarlos fuera de casa, ya afuera, son de lo mas tiernos y no muerden para nada, pero igual, el mismo procedimiento de caminarlos en tus manos no te fallará. 7 a?os y mas de 10 hamsters me avalan :D|`|09768e0299049d5c9d909f94a05a7702aa	no mucho<br>  solo paciencia y cari?o|`|aZPwqw69aa	Para diestrar hamsters??<br>  Son zurdos acaso??<br>  XD|`|1e21bfd13e3c93b4573012c214be87c8aa	Es poco probable adiestrar un hamster.

IKBb3oE8aa	è normale ne ho uno anch io ed ho preferito farlo uscire dalla gabbia solo sotto la mia supervisione o in giardino. essendo un roditori deve sempre rosicchiare tt cio che trova scarpe, buste e via dicendo in gabbia nn lo può fare essendo un ambiente stretto, ma quando lo libero è una "belva" in tt i sensi addirittura si mette a rincorrere i gatti x giocare con loro che si spaventano a morte e scappano. addiritttura se il tuo ti sembra strano proprio l altro giorno mentre gli cambiavo la lettiera nella gabbia mi è entrata la micia più piccola di 3 mesi e lui ha iniziato a darle delle liccate sul muso come fossero dei bacini. ma ci pensi!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2A5d8SYwaa	ascolta Federica...<br>  io ho 3 coniglietti, e anche loro sono molto vivaci...solo che, vivendo liberi, non hanno la necessità di "scappare" appena li libero, ma godono della possibilità di esplorare il territorio quindi sono più docili, in più sono sterilizzati per cui molto più calmi e non sentono l'esigenza di marcare il territorio!!!<br>  E' importante che controlli che il tuo veterinario sia esperto in esotici..<br>  sul forum del sito www.aaeconigli.it<br>  troverai comunque persone che sapranno indicarti quello a te più vicino...<br>  <br>  mi raccomando...non lasciarla chiusa in gabbia, piuttosto dalla in adozione (parla con le volontarie dell'associazione) soffrirebbe di meno, te lo assicuro!!!!|`|5jRdVCX6aa	ho avuto un coniglio per 6 anni e ti posso dire che i conigli sono un po skizofrenici, sono un po matti, è normale;il fatto di saltare come un pazzo e correre e fare scatti improvvisi è sintomo di felicità,dopo tempo nella gabbietta è questo il loro modo per divertirsi,il fatto di fare pipi sul divano bhè a me non è mai capitato, ma magari è solo un coniglietto un po agitato,tranquilla...il fatto di mordere e laccare avvicinarsi e non, fa parte del suo carattere e del carattere in generale del coniglio, di solito i conigli bianchi hanno questo atteggiamento..cmq non ti preoccupare magari con il tempo cambierà, non provare ad educarlo, è un coniglio ed è un impresa assai improbabile..ciao|`|AiHlyR8raa	Dunque liberalo in altra stanza no dove c'e il divano mettigli una cassettina per la pipì con un pò di sporco con la gabbia.<br>  Non corrergli dietro siediti per terra e aspetta sarà lei che si avvicina.

C'è un solo modo per farla tranquillizzare ed è la sterilizzazione: in questo modo sarà meno aggressiva perché avrà meno ormoni in circolo..

L'altra opzione sarebbe sterilizzare la bestiolina. Ma non è la soluzione migliore. Ha bisogno di accoppiarsi. Ciao da fulmine.|`|iFFVj7vGaa	prima di tutto, il suggerimento del collare e lo strattone è completamente sbagliato, le punizioni, i rimproveri e/o scappellotti vari, con il coniglio *non* funzionano. <br>  Con i conigli si usa il rinforzo positivo, cioè, premiala quando fa qualcosa di buono.<br>  Le corse e i salti improvvisi sono normali nel coniglio! In più se lo tieni chiuso sente anche il bisogno di scaricare tutta l'energia accumulata.<br>  Non rincorrerla, il coniglio è una preda in natura e se tu la rincorri per casa le dai l'impressione che tu sia un predatore (a meno che non lo prenda come un gioco, a volte lo facevo con la mia coniglia ^_^). Se vuoi che venga da te, mettiti per terra, con un pezzo di mela o altra frutta o uvetta passa, insomma, qualcosa che le piace, e aspetta.<br>  Quanto tempo ha? Può anche darsi che sia nel pieno della sua adolescenza e come per noi è un periodo di ribellione. I conigli raggiungono la maturità sessuale intorno ai 4/5/6 mesi.<br>  Gli ormoni sono tutti in subbuglio, sono nervosi, segnano il territorio. Se ha fatto pipì altre volte lì, magari continua a sentire l'odore e ormai lo considera suo.<br>  Al contrario dell'utente che ha detto che ha bisogno di accoppiarsi e sconsiglia la sterilizzazione, io te la consiglio caldamente.<br>  Soprattutto perchè hai una femmina. L'operazione la calmerà molto, non segnerà il territorio e soprattutto, non avrà gravidanze isteriche, che a lungo portano a problemi uterini e tumori.<br>  Il tuo veterinario è specializzato in esotici?<br>  Altra cosa... cerca di tenerla chiusa il meno possibile, il coniglio non è animale da gabbia, se puoi allestisci una stanza per lei.<br>  Io ho tutta la casa a prova di coniglio, pensa che ho due ex coniglie da pentola e sono bravissime, sembra di non averle!

Tambien nos cuidan, en mi caso tengo dos Schnauzer gigante que me siguen y vigilan por fuera de la casa donde vaya se quedan sentados o mirando hacia la ventana hasta que me voy a dormir ^^U, lo mismo con el poodle de vive dentro de la casa que es de mi madre pero me hace mas caso a mi que a ella por que pasa mas tiempo conmigo -.-<br>  <br>  Conclusion, entre mas conosco a los hombres (humanos) mas quiero a mis perros.|`|XgCF2WKnaa	el ser humano,como animal que es,es egoista por naturaleza,ademas,como nos consideramos "seres superiores" pensamos (estoy incluyendo a toda la humanidad,disculpen,es que no encuentro otra forma de explicarlo que no sea hablando en general) que el dinero debe de ser usado para ayudar seres humanos en lugar de ayudar animales (que,al fin y al cabo,tambien son seres y mucho mas humanos que nosotros) y con el tema de llevarla todos los meses al veterinario,a mi me parece genial,me encantaria hacer lo mismo,pero no alcanza el dinero para pagar la consulta de mis dos gatas y mis dos perros,son cosas que pasan...y eso de sacrificarla o abandonarla lo dice la gente sin capacidad de amar a otros seres,si tenes una hcarla con alguno del unico tema del que te van a poder hablar es de ELLOS,los animales merecen tener la misma calidad de via que nosotros,por brindarnos amor,acompa?arnos,cuidarnos,e incluso hacer trabajos para nosotros (los perros de policia,los de los bomberos,los perros rescatistas,preguntales a esos si alguna vez se pusieron a pensar que pasaria si quedaran atrapados debajo de 5 o 6 metros de nieve)|`|r2CcWSzOaa	Los seres humanos somos egoístas por naturaleza.

Un animalito necesita educacion, si los sacamos de su ambiente natural y los metimos a nuestras casas (que fue lo que hicimos con los perros y los gatos, aunque en ese entonces no han de haber sido casas -sino cuevas!) lo minimo que podemos hacer es procurar que esten sanos y bien alimentados... aunque tambien hay gente que exagera (Yoga para perros???) pero yo creo que si alguien es bueno con los animales tambien lo sera con las personas.<br>  <br>  Y a final de cuentas... cada quien hace con su dinero lo que se le de la gana!!!
03zGxw9xaa	Your dog certainly loved that one! Like said, perhaps it was the wrong size for your dog. Try another, maybe going to the vets for advice on the size! How about giving your dog a natural kong? A bone!

The pastel ones are made for puppies, the red ones are for slight chewers and then there are the black ones. The black ones are for the dogs that are power chewers.

On the Kong website they have a satisfaction guarantee. That if you are not satisfied with the kong within 30 days, they will refund your money.

bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	Until you can get him to a vet (which you cannot avoid, and it's best that you not try to avoid it because if you somehow wind up with a dead bird because of it, at least you'll have the comfort of knowing you did something other than watch him suffer in illness - <a href="http://www.aav.org/vet-lookup/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aav.org/vet-lookup/</a> ), I would put him in a smaller cage, if available. If not, move the food/water bowls nice and low along with perches and toys so if he falls, he doesn't fall far. Sick birds may have poor balance, and the last thing you want on top of all of this is an injury. <br>  <br>  Keep him warm. I would say 75F is around a good temperature, and also, a slightly higher level of humidity would be nice. You should never leave a bird in a cold, dry place, especially since parrots are native to warm, humid areas. If you can't get him to a specifically heated area, get a hot water bottle and lay it on the bottom tray of the cage, then lay a towel on top. It'll keep him warm without burning him. Call a vet and see when you can go in. Until he begins acting like his normal self or he sees a vet, keep him in this "hospital" cage setup. Be sure to check the water bottle often so it doesn't get cold on him.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11767019	You have two choices at this point, and I don't mean to be cruel or sound mean, but this bird should have been to a vet days ago, when you first noticed signs of illness.You can either find a VET, or watch it DIE.

Your bird is sick and needs medical attention.<br>  Best Wishes|`|754bd6b84d968f8022ac25421d9a5394aa	If he's in the cage, you should take him out and give him some attention.

Este tipo de se?ales son producidas por secreciones odoríferas, llamadas feromonas, contenidas en la orina, las glándulas anales, las glándulas sebáceas, las glándulas sudoríparas de las almohadillas plantaras y los oídos. Debido a que estas secreciones son utilizadas como medio de comunicación entre diferentes individuos se denominan "feromonas sociales" y a los olores que emiten "olores sociales". Estos olores identificatorios son  específicos y característicos de cada individuo y a través de los cuales los animales se identifican entre sí. Por eso cuando dos perros se encuentran, se olfatean mutuamente tanto la zona anal como la genital y los oídos. También gracias a estos olores cada animal puede reconocer tanto su grupo de pertenencia como su propio territorio.|`|2463920d80644431caac0959a40bba60aa	Dicen que hace muchos a?os los perros cuando morian también llegaban al cielo  ,una vez en la tierra  se produjo una peste que eliminó a millones de perros  y uno de los requisitos para entrar al cielo era que tenian que dejar la parte de atras en  informes , una vez adentro se produjo una guerra entre los perros  y los echaron del cielo y como salian despavoridos  cada cual agarraba el primer cu-lo que encontraba  de resultas todos salieron con la cola equivocada.....es por eso que ahora cuando un perro ve a otro lo primero que hace es olerle la parte de atras para ver si es la suya|`|6fad7056f6c95bd5734b9d4e9c06f484aa	Creo que asi se conocen o identifican.|`|fAVb5uNmaa	bien  te dire  el motivo...esto  data  ya  de los tiempos de la  prehistoria...se  dice que  el burro  que no tenia que hacer se le  ocurrio hacer  una fiesta  de perros...para ver que tal se comportaban  juntos..logico era  para limar  diferencias  entre  ellos...bueno  pues   fueron  todos  los  perros  invitados  ..obligandolos  bajo  juramento  de  decir  verdad.. a que  se portarian  bien  y los  hicieron  firmar  la entrada a dicha  fiesta..y los    condicionaron a  dejar  en ganchos  colgados  su  c.u.l.o  ( su  a.n.o.) al salir  se los entregarian...ya sabes  por aquello de algun  pleito..pero la corrupcion que todo lo mueve  provoco que alguno  con  algun  dinero entrara  sin  quitarse  su  c.u.l.i.t.o..y bueno...todo  se  llevo a cabo  en buen termino  hasta  que empezaron a hacer  efecto las  copas...ya sabes  la musica  con la  banda  perra..y  no  falto que perrita  ya medio  embriagada  empezara  a   subirse  a las  mesas...a mostrar  sus  miserias..y  bueno   logico  que  algun perro  medio  morboso  le  toco las  nalgas  y  zasss  que  resulta que  el novio  vio  y que  viene a reclamar...empesaron las  discusiones  los  mordiscos  las mentadas  y que  se  suelta  el zafarancho   perruno...se  hiso  un autentico  d.e.s.m.a.d.r.e..y  se  generalizo  el desorden  en  el lugar...el burro  no sabia q ue hacer.. y  pues   l?e hablo a la policia...y  todos  al oir  las  sirenas  salieron  de estampida  a  empujones  tomaban  el que creian era  su  c.u.l.o  de los  ganchos   y  se lo ponian  y  a correr...como te imaguinaras  al  llegar a casa   y  recobrar  la calma  se dieron cuenta  que  el c.u.lo que habian tomado..no era  el propio...y  desde entonces  cada  vez que  ven a un perro  se le hacercan  y lo huelen  pensando   traera  este  mi c.u.l.o???  y asi  por  los  siglos  de los  siglos...bye.....|`|ptCyxkMwaa	es su forma de reconocerse
539092666d4e4398d6b300451aab4d88aa	C'è da tenere presente, innanzitutto, che gravidanza e parto per una cagnolina chihuahua non sono mai una passeggiata. Essendo così piccole il rischio maggiore è che possano sorgere gravi complicazioni e mettere a repentaglio la vita sia della cagnetta che dei cucciolini. Quindi, il primissimo consiglio è: o si è allevatori più che esperti (ma anche in quel caso...massima attenzione a ogni possibile sintomo di disagio) o farsi seguire passo passo dall'accoppiamento fino al completo svezzamento dei cuccioli da un veterinario. (e purtroppo non è una cosa di poco costo,lo ammetto) <br>  Quindi, se non si ha possibilità di poter spendere,io consiglio di evitare l'accoppiamento tra cagnolini tanto delicati.<br>  In ogni caso,la cagnetta in buona salute può essere giudicata idonea all'accoppiamento a partire dai 20 mesi di età, quindi, poco meno di due anni e si consiglia di non farle avere più di 3 gravidanze nell'arco di tutta la vita. (l'ideale sarebbe al massimo due, comunque intervallate da almeno un anno di riposo)|`|AiHlyR8raa	Quando la femmina è in calore.|`|G1SmI6oBaa	Per il maschio non c'è problema: può accoppiarsi sempre. Per la femmina è consigliato dopo che la cagna abbia compiuto i 2 anni di età; altrimenti potrebbe morire per complicanze da parto. Essendo la testa dei chihuahua molto grossa, molte volte succede che si debba ricorrere al taglio cesareo. E' bene quindi che l'accoppimento avvenga con un maschio di taglia minore rispetto a quella della femmina.

Essendo che i cani sudano attraverso la lingua respirano a bocca aperta per ventilare a volte fanno davvero dei versi da paura. Prova a mettere degli asciugamani umidi per terra in modo che lui si possa sdraiare sul fresco, bagnagli sempre la testa e il muso è molto importante.è anche un cane piuttosto piccolo potresti metterlo in vasca a fargli un bagnetto fresco!Per quanto riguarda il fatto che zoppichi ti posso parlare della mia esperienza con il mio cane che d'estate (vivendo noi in una zona con tanta umidità) a volte zoppica all'improvviso e mi hanno detto che è un pò di artrite che viene con l'umidità.Ma ovviamente lui ha anche già 6 anni ed è molto grosso e pesante.Potrebbe essere il caso del tuo che in proporzione i bulldog sono belli tarchiatelli e magari con l'umidità e il peso succede.Prova a vedere se le articolazioni sono più gonfie o se si lamenta quando le stringi un pò. Se non migliora vai da un altro veterinario e non aspettare troppo! Ciao!|`|p9ggzfRIaa	prima di prendere un bulldog ti dovevi informare della razza|`|wwyfOTFNaa	ciao!io cn il mio pikolo amico gerry per evitare di farlo morire dal  caldo gli passo sul corpo delle salviettine fresche...così soffre di meno...e cerco di mettergli del'acqua fresca più volte al giorno...in bocca al lupo!un mega kiss

AOOehKmPaa	Ciao Kiara è successo pure a me! Ho due cani e tutti e due certe volte ringhiano quando li coccolo ma col tempo ho capito che non ringhiavano tutti e due per lo stesso motivo: Jessie ringhiava perché non aveva voglia di coccole ma Toma ringhiava per manifestare quanto gli piacevano le mie coccole, sembrerà strano ma è così! Secondo me col tempo si possono capire le reazioni dei cani.<br>  Ciao e spero di esserti stata utile|`|AiHlyR8raa	Anch'io mi chiedevo come il ringhio.

Un cane può manifestare gioia in questo modo mentre invece non si può assolutamente permettere di ringhiare con cattiveria al padrone. Ma può anche essere che in quel momento gli facesse male qualche parte del corpo che gli hai toccato accarezzandolo. Prova a farci caso... nel caso non lo facesse per gioco allora devi intervenire con un po' di disciplina adeguata, facendoti consigliare anche dal tuo veterinario. Se non si corregge in fretta un comportamento del genere rischi che prima o poi voglia prendere il sopravvento. Fammi sapere. Baci  :)|`|IZpXWCPvaa	secondo me si anke il mio ROCKY a volte lo fa ma magari lo fa x'vuole semplicemente essere lasciato in pace 2 minuti poi tornano ad essere dolcissimi :) ciau|`|c037f96a03224b8ae729434f00ecf9c9aa	mmm....ringhia o ride.....ti spiego, la mia piccoletta quando la coccolo mi mostra la punta dei denti e fa un verso simile al ringhio ma....ride, scodinzola come una matta e si gode le coccole.<br>  se il ringhio è cattivo e non scodinzola probabilmente gli stai dando fastidio.....capita anche a noi il momento in cui gli altri ci danno fastidio e non vogliamo essere toccati o disturbati.|`|tiFWqxwWaa	Beh forse non le vuole le coccole!!! ihih si si gurda gli animali te lo fanno capire quando c'ê qlc che non gli piace !! ciao ciao

Se non c'è una vera necessità di prenderlo in braccio, ma vuoi solo coccolarlo, mettiti alla sua altezza. Siediti per terra, tieni a portata di mano un po' di leccornie (frutta, la sua verdura preferita) e aspetta che sia lui a venire.<br>  <br>  Puoi provare ancora ad abituarlo ad usare la gabbia, ma avendo già più di un anno lui fa i bisogni in giro per casa anche per segnare il territorio. Dovresti pensare alla sterilizzazione, ridurresti il problema bisogni in giro, sarebbe meno nervoso e ridurresti possibili problemi ai testicoli.<br>  Per abituarlo a fare i bisogni nella gabbia dovresti tenerlo chiuso in gabbia per un paio di settimane, senza farlo uscire, per dargli modo di capire che deve sporcare lì. Quando fa le palline in giro, prendile e mettile nella gabbia. Non sgridarlo, non funziona e lo spaventi. Se vedi che ha un posto preferito dove la fa più spesso, l'unica è mettegli una lettiera proprio lì.<br>  Ma prova ad informarti anche sulla sterilizzazione.<br>  Hai un vet. specializzato in esotici che puoi consultare?<br>  <br>  Altri consigli... beh, per evitare un romanzo, ti do dei link<br>  <a href="http://www.casafreccia.it" rel="nofollow">http://www.casafreccia.it</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bunnies.it" rel="nofollow">http://www.bunnies.it</a><br>  <a href="http://lacollinadeiconigli.net" rel="nofollow">http://lacollinadeiconigli.net</a><br>  più il primo sito che ti ho consigliato.

Le prime volte è meglio se gliele fai tagliare al veterinario perché (soprattutto se è di colore scuro come il mio) rischi di tagliargliele troppo corte e fargli male. Vai dal veterinario (il mio lo fa gratuitamente, altrim non ti costa + di 5€) e ti fai spiegare bene. La volta prossima compri una forbicina apposita che trovi nel negozio di animali e lo fai tu!<br>  <br>  2) Non c'è modo per abituare i coniglietti... sono affettuosi ma molto lunatici (soprattutto quando sono più grandi)... se non vuole farsi prendere in braccio non c'è verso di abituarlo... fagli le coccole senza prenderlo in mano! Si vede che gli dà fastidio... <br>  <br>  3) Per abituarlo basta che prendi i suoi bisognini con la carta igienica e glieli rimetti in un angolino della gabbietta. Vedrai che dopo due o tre volte che l'hai fatto inizierà a farli dove glieli hai messi!<br>  <br>  Per quanto riguarda i consigli....<br>  Per giocare prendi un rotolo di carta igienica vuoto e riempilo di fieno... vedrai come si diverte a tirarla fuori! Oppure prendi dei rametti di prugno, albicocco o pesco e faglieli rosicchiare!<br>  <br>  Spero di esserti stata d'aiuto, un saluto anche a Lolli!|`|gpkphcV1aa	1) quando vedi le unghie del coniglio troppo lunghe è meglio tagliargliele: una volta al mio se ne è staccata una perchè troppo lunga e doveva essersela impigliata da qualche parte; puoi tagliargliele te con una forbicina apposta per le unghie dei conigli che trovi al supermercato (ma se il tuo coniglio è tranquillo anche cn una forbice normale, ma atento a nn tagliarle troppo ma solo la parte in +) o se t senti + sicuro farglielo fare dal vet...però nn so quanto costa.<br>  2) per me se lo prendi in braccio e cerca di scappare può darsi che abbia paura per la sensazione che prova, o semplicemente perchè preferisce gironzolare da solo per casa a curiosare; <br>  3) per sta abitudine ti capisco perchè anche il mio, quando lo lasciavo libero, ha sempre fatto i suoi bisogni fuori dalla gabbia e sopratt quasi sempre nelle stesse zone!!...credo che lo facciano per marcare il territorio. adesso che è diventato vecchiotto è raro che lo faccia ancora...ma prima nn sono mai riuscita ad evitare che lo facesse.<br>  <br>  come altri consigli posso dirti che una volta sn dovuta andare dal vet. per il mio cane e già che c'ero gli ho parlato del mio coniglio: ha detto che è meglio abituare i conigli a mangiare solo fieno e nn dargli cibo in scatola; poi ogni tanto di dargli qualche foglia di insalata - non fredda e non bagnata- o pezzi di carote.<br>  <br>  per quanto riguarda i giochi: ho notato che al mio, quando era + giovane, piaceva un sacco saltellare e rotolarsi su una vecchia coperta spiegazzata sul pavimento.|`|oiPbjryjaa	ciao!si le unghie vanno tagliate perchè si può fare male, le puoi tagliare con un semplice taglia unghie nella punta se l'unghia è bianca guarda bene dove inizia la parte più rosa che è la parte irrorata che non devi toccare (se l'unghia è pigmentata e non si vede non andare troppo in fondo ma se sanguina un pò basta tamponare e passa); non c'è bisogno di farlo fare a un vet!<br>  se non si vuol far prendere in braccio non costringerlo perchè scalciando si può fare molto male e poò caderti, i conigli sono molto fragili, se lo vuoi calmare lascialo a terra, accarezzalo, tappagli gli occhi delicatamente con la mano e lo prendi così si dovrebbe calmare (non prenderlo mai per le orecchie).<br>  dopo un anno si dovrebbe già essere abituato a farla nelle gabbia, per un pò non farlo uscire in modo da fargli fare sempre i bisogni dentro e poi appena li fa lo fai uscire, mentre se il problema è la marcatura fallo sterilizzare e previeni anche i tumori all'apparato genitale che possono colpire i maschi!ciaociao:)|`|EjUFEMWkaa	Alcuni suggerimenti:<br>  <br>  1) Qualche volta puoi far uscire il tuo coniglio dalla gabbia (sempre che lo faccia spontaneamente) per sgranchirsi un po' le zampe.<br>  <br>  2) Puoi integrare la sua dieta con lattuga, radicchio o mela.<br>  <br>  3) Non è consigliabile fargli il bagno: potrebbe ammalarsi.<br>  <br>  4) Di solito non ama i rumori molto forti: lo spaventano.<br>  <br>  5) Come lettiera puoi usare la segatura: va cambiata almeno una o due volte alla settimana.|`|Mo2G09bsaa	ciao, so risponderti solo alla 2a domanda, per prenderlo in braccio lo devi prendere da dietro al collo e poi devi mettere la mano sotto le zampe così vedrai che non scapperà.|`|QKgrYkSCaa	ciao.. anche io ho un coniglietto nano... all'inizio è normale che sia diffidente... non andarlo a prendere xke si spaventa ancora di più, devi avvicinarti con calma magari con un mazzetto di fieno che a loro piace molto... devi acquistare la sua fiducia, e avere pazienza. non ci vuole moltissimo se gli eviti i traumi da inseguimento per prenderlo... anche io ho fatto cosi e ora mi viene incontro ed è anche fin troppo avventuroso... per il discorso dei bisogni prova a mettere una pagina di giornale dove li fa di solito poi dopo un pò cambi il posto del giornale (quello sporco) il coniglietto tende a fare i bisogni nel posto in cui lascia i suoi odori, se questi odori li sposti  lui cambierà posto fino a quando tu non metterai il giornale nella lettiera facendo capire al coniglietto quele è il posto della pipi e altro... è un procedimento lungo lo spostamento del giornale non deve essere fatto in tre giorni, ogni tanto devi cambiare il foglio senno poi ti puzza tutta la casa.... spero che questo sistema risolva il tuo problema.... un salutone!!!|`|aGCSciImaa	I conigli nani sono animali molto paurosi quindi non ti meravigliare se non si fa prendere o toccare, è normale; vedrai ch epiano piano si abitueròà alla tua presenza e diventerà meno diffidente, ma non credo che si farà mai prnedere. IPer quanto riguarda  le unghie invece dovresti tagliarle, esistono delle forbicine adatte , se le lasci rischia di graffiarsi da solo. E poi per quanto riguarda i suoi bisogni devi abituarlo sgridandolo, magari nella gabbietta mettigli qualcosa a parte dove andare a fare i suoi bisogni, man mano imparerà anche quello.

rEZEemufaa	First you need to find out if any of them are fertile.  Do this by holding them over a flashlight that is on.  If you can see any dark masses in the egg then there's a baby in there.  You need to leave these with the parents and plan on giving them to a pet store when they're weaned.<br>  <br>  Secondly, remove any infertile ones (clear inside).  Throw them out.  If there are no fertile ones at all then keep 3 or 4 of them.  Boil these and place them in the bottom of the cage.<br>  <br>  If she sits on the eggs she will eventually realize that they are not fertile (you made this happen but she doesn't know that).  Boil any additional eggs that she lays the day she lays them to keep them infertile.  With patience she will eventually stop laying eggs because its pointless in her birdy mind.<br>  <br>  While she is still laying eggs you need to provide her with extra calcium so that she doesn't deplete her own stores too much.  She can become very ill if she does.<br>  <br>  If after about 2-3 months she is still laying eggs like crazy take her to an avian vet for a consultation.  They may have some other tips that I don't know of.|`|647e8a48ad9fe5f5763a7ce619d1e9ffaa	you'll have to raise them till a certain age.|`|B9nMe9DCaa	The only thing you can do with the eggs is eat them or throw them away. If you let her keep them and she nests on them, then she'll eventually stop laying. The females have a "maternal instinct" that tells her if it's good or bad. She'll most likely roll out the bad ones. If they hatch, then let her care for them, give her enough food. <br>  If you feed them to her or she cracks one open, she'll most likely eat it. The shell is good calcium for her and the newly forming eggs. She might develop a nack for eatting them, and it's no problem. The eggs won't be waisted and there will be no new hatchlings to care for. <br>  Or, if left for her to nest, you can alway bust one open around the fourth day from the egg was laid (and sat on) to see if it's fertile. (Or candle the eggs)|`|ym9nSmgcaa	try to hatch them then sell 'em and get money to!!!!|`|a9f92fdb4295b3c519cee5655b96e57faa	Just throw them away. Finches do this all the time. Even one single female will sometimes keep laying eggs. Throw them out and if you want them to raise babies, they will start anew. Also, even if you didn't have a nest in the cage, she will probably lay eggs anyway. I actually had a pair of finches lay eggs on the bottom of their cage and they sat on and hatched the eggs. If you don't want babies, you must throw the eggs away as soon as she lays them so as not to destroy a growing embryo.|`|bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	Jonergin's answer is great, so I'll just add onto it:<br>  <br>  To avoid situations like this in the future, cover the cage for at least 12 hours at night. Make sure it's totally silent and dark for those 12 hours. <br>  Only feed them what they'll eat per day, no more and no less. You don't want t starve them, but you also don't want them to think they have enough food to feed babies. <br>  Rearrange the cage so that all of the toys and perches are changing, food bowls (if possible) are moving, and not one thing stays the same in the cage for more than a week. An environment that's always changing is good for birds because they need mental stimulation, but not stable enough for hatchlings, so birds won't want to hatch babies in that environment.<br>  <br>  Since she's laying an awful lot already, after this clutch, you may want to take her into an avian vet anyway just for a checkup. If needed, they'll give you medications or tips to help her body recover from all of the egg-laying.
c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	#1- probably nothing to worry about.  if it's mainly clear, it could just be that he ate or drank too fast.  my puppy does that too.<br>  <br>  #2- watch him closely.  if the vomit is white, and he seems to whine a lot or be in pain, you need to atke him into the vet ASAP.  my puppy threw up 4 times in 1 hr, and whined in pain.  it turned out to be pancreaitis, and neede to be treated ASAP.  <br>  <br>  i don't think you have anything to worry about, just watch him, and make sure his condidtion doesn't change.  feed him a little at a time, split his food up into smaller meals, and see if that helps.  don't worry, just keep an eye on him.  i hope he feels better.<br>  <br>  ps.- no bones or rawhides!  limit his treats.|`|26c308298cd79e088e37b6a6057affb1aa	when my puppy vomits  i go to petco or another animal store and buy the grass the comes in a pot. it's good for there intestines, and helps him with tummy problems, this is good for mine, you may want to take him/her to the vets.<br>  <br>  what does his feces look like, maybe he's getting too much water.|`|8hDrARwGaa	Don't act like it's an emergency so just call the vet and ask what you should do.

It is an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Since these hormones are essential for life, this is an extremely serious disease and it must be treated as such.<br>  <br>  Adrenal insufficiency can be primary or secondary. Primary adrenocorticism affects salt/potassium balance in the body and glucorticoid as well. Secondary adrenocorticism usually only affects the glucocorticoids. It is not known why primary adrenocorticism occurs but it may be an immune mediated process. Secondary adrenocorticism probably occurs most often when prednisone or other cortisone being administered for medical reasons are suddenly withdrawn. It can occur as a result of pituitary cancer or some other process that interferes with production of hormones that stimulate the adrenal glands.<br>  <br>  Most dogs with Addison's disease initially have gastrointestinal disturbances like vomiting. Lethargy it also a common early sign. Poor appetite can occur as well. These are pretty vague signs and it is extremely easy to miss this disease. More severe signs occur when a dog with hypoadrenocorticism is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function. Dogs with this problem will sometimes suffer severe shock symptoms when stressed, which can lead to a rapid death. When potassium levels get high heart arrythmias occur or even heart stoppage which also is fatal. In some cases, especially secondary Addison's disease, there are no detectable electrolyte changes.<br>  <br>  This disease can be picked up by changes in the ratio between sodium or potassium by accident at times. When this happens it is still extremely important to treat for it. It is confirmed by an ACTH response test -- administration of this hormone should stimulate production of adrenal hormones. If this does not occur then hypoadrenocorticism is present. In cases in which the electrolyte levels are normal this is the only test for the problem and it will be missed unless it is looked for specifically. At times this disease can be hard to differentiate from renal failure because the symptoms and even the bloodwork can be similar ---- so the ACTH response test may be necessary to differentiate them.<br>  <br>  Treatment for this disease is usually done by oral administration of fludrocortisone acetate (Flurinaf), salting the food, and administration of corticosteroids like prednisone. In a crisis situation this disorder must be treated more aggressively with intravenous fluids, IV glucocorticoids and correction of acid/base balances.<br>  <br>  You have to pay close attention to a dog with this problem. Don't ignore any changes in appetite, GI disturbances or anything else that makes you think your dog is ill. If you work with your vet and are careful about following his or her directions this disease has a good prognosis when it is discovered before a crisis occurs. <br>  <br>  My 11 year old Westie was diagnosed with this 3 years ago. He is doing well with daily and monthly treatments. We thought he has an intestinal problem and then after cancer surgery it was discovered he had addisons. It is a hidden disease and can go undiagnosed.|`|by8Dh8E8aa	It could be a variety of issues. If he isn't being feed in a certain amount of time dogs can get upset stomachs and puke bile before and even after they eat. If he is getting fed on a regular schedule or has access to food at all time it could be a variety of other reasons. He might have gotten into something, might have chewed on a plant, grass or come into contact with something that has upset his stomach. Also, if there is stress in the household or something new that can stress him can cause this issue. I would just watch his behavior, weight and if he can keep most of his food down, if it continues more then a week then take him to a vet. Otherwise, he should be fine. Dogs get acid reflux just like humans do.|`|393a1477f16a23f178dc66390c901f65aa	You may not need to RUSH him to the vet..........but you may want to take,him.<br>  He may have some kind of intestinal blockage which will require surgery.<br>  Or.........he may just have a bug.     <br>  It's hard to tell........could he have gotten into something in the yard??<br>  When I worked for a vet we had a bull terrier come in for constipation and after a full workup and barium X-ray, did exploratory surgery and found that the dog had eaten the owner's leather vest.  (could have taken it to the dry cleaner, it wasn't even mouthed)<br>  I'm assuming he is up on his vaccines?<br>  An office visit, if nothing else is wrong, will run you less than $30, at least in my area, and may help to ease your mind.|`|2c864bf754de60c67fb58c4bc031c57aaa	If you're concerned and it sounds like you are, then I would suggest that you give your vet a call.

VOGX6orvaa	I would separate (quarantine) it for at least 2 weeks. If you don't, the sickness might be contagious and could spread to the other.

This is important, it helps them life longer happier lives.  They can also help to find a bun that will suit your lifestyle the best.  Even though most of their buns are full grown, they are in great need of a home.  They also can tell you things like the bun's likes and dislikes.  Pet stores are only about making money and provide poor care instructions.  Buns are not something you can put into a cage and just feed some pellets everyday.  They require complex care and grooming.  A rescue will talk with you, give you excellent advice and provide you with a new member for your family, not just a pet.<br>  <br>  <br>  PLEASE DO NOT GO TO A PET STORE!!!!

The show ring is the proving ground for breeding quality, so a dog that does not achieve it's championship is not of a quality to be bred.

o0Oy7muGaa	I mean no offense, but I would have to disagree with a lot of whant devlishblue eyes says.  I do not know what he typically feeds his rabbits, however in my experience, many breeders feed their rabbits at the lowest cost possible.  Therefore many of them feed a diet consisting mainly of pellets, little to no fresh veggies and some hay.<br>  <br>  Your rabbit should have an unlimited amount of hay.  I don't want to say it doesn't do anything to effect the weight of your bun, but it makes less of an impact than pellets do.  For a bun your age, it is time for Timothy Hay.  If you bun is on alfalfa, mix the timothy and alfalfa, decreasing the alfalfa and increasing the timothy daily.  It should take a about 10 days to make this transition.<br>  <br>  If you feed a set amount of pellets everyday, slowly decrease that amount until you reach a acceptable amount.  For example, if you normally feed 1 cup of pellets throughout the day, say in the morning, and leave them for the day.  Divide that amount in half and feed it twice a day.  This will encourage your bun to graze on the hay and veggies (I'll get to that) through out the day.  Gradually decrease that amount every other day.  By gradually- it should take probably 2 weeks to get down to your goal feeding amount.  The average weight for a mini-rex is 4-5 lbs.  For a bun that size, your goal feeding amount should be 1/2 cup.  But this 1/2 cup should be divided into two 1/4 cup servings, morning and evening.  <br>  <br>  Is your bun eating fresh veggies on a daily basis?  If not, he should be.  The goal amount for his weight would be about 2 cups of fresh veggies daily.  Again, you will have to introduce this to him slowly.  I would start out with just a few peices of leafy greens (say the size of a spinach leaf) a day for a few days, then a few more and so on.  Indroducing the veggies too quickly will surely give him the a poopy behind.<br>  <br>  As a note, your pelleted food should be a high quality food without all that "junk" in it.  This is what I feed my bun, which my vet OK'd.  Though when he was a little "chubby"  the vet advised me it would be best to pick out the orange things and use them as a treat.  (1-2 daily).  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/global/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441777395&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302047887&ASSORTMENT%3C%3East_id=2534374302023695&bmUID=1180727289408&itemNo=1&In=Small+Pet&N=2047887&Ne=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/global/product_d...</a>  You can get it only at Petsmart.<br>  <br>  <br>  Remember corn encourages 'bulking' up as it is given to animals (rabbits, cows, horses) in order to build fat- with horses, mainly to help them stay warm in the winter.<br>  <br>  You should also increase the excersise time that your bun has.  Laying around just stores calories.  If your bun is in a cage, he probably needs more room to move around freely.  I suggest buying a puppy play enclosure ( <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/global/product_detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441781990&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302035803&ASSORTMENT%3C%3East_id=2534374302023689&bmUID=1180727599219&itemNo=4&In=Dog&N=2035803&Ne=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/global/product_d...</a> ) and use that as a cage instead (that is what my bun is in).  This is assuming your bun lives indoors.  It would not be a safe enclosure outside.|`|Ectn7tkSaa	I would ask the vet what a rabbit if that age should be eating.  But are you sure it is over weight?|`|m28K16Diaa	well baby rabbits eat a differnt kind of hay if your baby rabbit eats alfalfa hay that is the fattining hay for babys!  adult rabbits eat timithy hay which is less fattining.<br>  <br>  also have your rabbit eat more timithy hay and less pellots|`|6Fj4u158aa	well, buy diet bunny food and start feeding it a little less everyday.|`|AA12106467	Your vet may need to learn a little more about rabbits.<br>  <br>  Don't judge your rabbit as being fat based upon its weight.  You can have a heavy rabbit and it can be perfectly healthy.  On the other hand you could also have a light weight rabbit and it be totally fat.  My point is that you shouldn't direclty correlate weight with being fat when it comes to rabbits.<br>  <br>  For a good starting point as far as feeding your rabbit goes.  Feed your rabbit just what it will eat in 24 hours.  Feed it rabbit pellets once a day.  By the end of 24 hours that feed should just barely be all gone.  A Mini Rex should eat about 4 ounces of food a day.  That means if you weighed the pellets on a dietary scale they would weigh about 4 ounces.  This equates to about a two-thirds baking cup of pellets.<br>  <br>  Rabbits unlike a lot of other animals will stop eating once they are full.  The main reason why you control how much they eat is not to prevent them from getting fat but to avoid the feed from going stale inside their bowl or feeder.  Rabbits do not like to eat stale food.<br>  <br>  Since weight does not correlate to a rabbit being fat, you may be wondering how you can tell your rabbit is fat.  Here's how:<br>  <br>  Grab your rabbit around the back or sides of the neck and see how much loose hide you can grab.  The looser the hide is the fatter your rabbit is.  This works because the majority of fat that a rabbit accumulates is accumulated directly under the hide.  The rest normally accumulates around the internal organs.  Normally the easiest place to tell is right around the neck/shoulder area.  Sometimes this is also exhibited by a large dewlap (flap of skin) under the chin of female rabbits.  Normally the bigger the dewlap the fatter the doe.<br>  <br>  So how do you control your rabbit from getting fat?  You control it not by how much it eats or by how much it excercises, but by WHAT it eats.  <br>  <br>  To avoid your rabbit getting fat, you have to avoid giving it foods that are high in energy.  That means avoiding giving it things like fruits, vegetables, and snacks.  Not only is it good to avoid these things to keep your rabbit from getting fat, but by avoiding them you can also help prevent your rabbit from getting diahrrea and from loosing fur quiet so easily.  When a rabbit's diet is too high in energy it has a greater chance of getting fat, getting diahrrea, and blowing its coat.<br>  <br>  Also compare the amount of fat in the rabbit pellets you buy with other rabbit pellets.  The amount of fat should not be over 3%.  Also compare the amount of crude protein with other rabbit pellets.  Crude protein is protein that your rabbit's digestive system cannot use.  So you don't want a feed with a lot of crude protein.  Also look at the ingredients of your rabbit pellets.  You don't want corn near the top of the ingredients list.  Corn is a high energy ingredient.  The closer it is to the top of the list, the larger the portion is that it takes up in the feed.<br>  <br>  I raise New Zealand rabbits and show them nationally.  New Zealands can very easily get fat.  And in good competition, if your New Zealand rabbit is fat or blowing it's coat, it can really hurt how your rabbit places.  Feed in that regard is very important.  In competition, fat rabbits are often referred to as being "soft in flesh".<br>  <br>  If you treat your rabbit regulary (once every 1-2 months) for parasites such as fur mites and fleas with Ivomec and your rabbit molts fairly regularly, then your feed may be too high in energy.  I've used one or two feeds that were that way and had to switch.  Too much energy in the feed increases the metabolism of the hair follicles on the rabbit, which causes the rabbit to molt or produce new fur to replace the old fur.<br>  <br>  Your rabbit feed should contain about 16-17% protein.<br>  <br>  To decrease the energy you feed your rabbit.  You can slightly reduce the amount of feed you feed your rabbit below what it will eat in one day.  But if you do that replace it with a little timothy hay.  Timothy hay is high in fiber and will help in that regard.  Replacing part of the feed with timothy hay will decrease the energy your rabbit consumes and also increase the amount of fiber it consumes.<br>  <br>  If you just work at reducing the amount of feed it eats and reducing its weight, all you may be doing is reducing the amount of muscle the rabbit has.  If that is the case, when you run your hand over the rabbit's back, the back will feel boney.  Once you get a rabbit to the point where it feels boney over the back, it is hard if not almost impossible to get the rabbit so where it no long feels like that.  The reason it feels like that is because it was not fed enough or quit eating and lost muscle.|`|sH6NyISJaa	Take it for a walk and quit feeding it so much....Wait, a rabbit can become over weight eating frickin carrots and lettuce?|`|Rz5e5dQIaa	what kind of breed of rabbit is it? this answer would help alot
K8t1lPXsaa	some breeds of dogs aren't recommended to have other dogs in the house however if properly socialized things should work out fine especially if you're getting a puppy. a puppy and an older dog have already established the power struggle for dominance. <br>  <br>  when you get your new dog it's best to restrict where it goes for a little while. the older dog gets the privileges because it's alpha. Don't ignore your puppy but when possible do things with your older dog first-feeding, treats, toys, etc. <br>  <br>  you will need to monitor your dogs together and you should not let your dogs meet each other face to face. If you can hold your puppy in your hand it'll be easier. have your older dog on a leash and let it sniff the puppies rear. if all goes well praise them and let them just observe each other. Light pawing and soft noises are acceptable but no barring of the teeth. <br>  <br>  If your older dog has a big size advantage over the puppy then make it lie down after they've sniffed each other. it's recommended that both dogs be on their leashes inside and out for the first few weeks just to make it easier to separate them if need be|`|OWnXNdGgaa	yes|`|Sh6u3qfAaa	Let her play with the pup.

Most people aren't too fond of them because they have a bad reputation, but really they are the most social and wonderful of all the rodents in my opinion. I have two and I got them young so they are very social with me, we take naps together and everything.

Antibiotics are started to prevent secondary infection like pneumonia.  The longer a dog goes untreated the more risk you take in it developing into full blown pneumonia.  More than likely your older dog is taking it harder.  The older you are the worse the symptoms.  The only way to see if it has become pneumonia is to do chest x-rays.  The vet is doing a good job by prescribing antibiotics.  If not better in a couple weeks, I personally would seek a second opinion.

If you only get two the dominant female will focus all abuse on the other. If you get more females, the abuse will be spread out among all of the others.<br>  <br>  Bettas are tropical fish, meaning they need their water to be 72-76 degrees fahrenheit, if they are not kept warm they will be lethargic and eat very little, they are cold blooded after all.<br>  <br>  Bettas need some swimming space, if they don't they could get bored and nip at their own fins (like some people chew their nails when bored, or some bird pluck their feathers). Also, provide him with some plants and decorations to help keep boredom at bay. DO NOT put a mirror in the tank. He will attack his reflection, and as entertaining as it may be for some people, your little betta could injure himself.<br>  <br>  Be sure the tank is on a level, sturdy surface that wont get bumped or jostled, as that can put stress on the fish, and he will be more susceptible to disease. Add some aquarium salt to the water too, NOT marine salt. Aquarium salt is for fresh water fish and will help your little guys stay healthy. Marine salt is for brackish and salt water fish, and is not what you need.<br>  <br>  Make sure you get a filter to maintain water quality, and be sure to set up the filter so there are no strong currents. Strong currents can tatter his fins.<br>  <br>  Okay okay, I know what you are probably thinking, "Why put one little fish in his own tank, thats so lame." You don't have to just have your betta, you could get him some tank mates. The tank mates cannot have flowy fins like his (ie: guppies or veil-tail danios), as your betta may attack. The tank mates should not be fin nippers (ie: danios, barbs, certain tetras) because they will go after your betta.<br>  You could get some bottom feeders (ie: cory cats) as they stick to the bottom, and won't bother your betta, and the betta won't bother them. Algae eaters could be possible tank mates as well.<br>  <br>  Don't get a common pleco though, they are sold at many pet stores, and many pet store staff members will tell you they will do fine in a 10 gallon...but plecos really need a large tank, as they can grow to considerable sizes.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little fishie :) best wishes.|`|R8BFzkzPaa	if you're in a country with a tropical climate year-round, your betta should be fine in a tank that is at least 3 gallons, and you won't need a heater. If you live in a place where the temperature drops below 25*c, you'll need a tank that is big enough to put a heater in. I would suggest that, heater or no heater, you get a tank of at least 5 gallons. Bettas like their swimming space too. Make sure the tank is covered, bettas DO jump. My betta Ajax jumped out of his tank the first day I got him because the lid didn't fit over the tank tight enough. He must've been on the ground for a while, his body was almost dry and he lost the ends of his tail, but he survived. Lucky little guy :) Anyway, getting back to the point, if your tank is 5 gallons or larger, you will need to cycle it. If you don't know what this is, a quick google search on 'cycling an aquarium' and 'the nitrogen cycle' will clear things up. If you cycle your tank, you'll need to buy a gravel vacuume and siphon out 20% of the water each week. If the tank is under 5 gallons, you'll have to do a full water change every week. You should get by fine with tap water, but you'll need to buy a water dechlorinator. That's about it, i think.... I hope I haven't left anything out! Email me if you have any further questions. Good luck!|`|3n60UxgQaa	Here's the short answer:<br>  <br>  The list of awesomeness:<br>  2.5+ gallon tank<br>  Heater<br>  Sponge filter<br>  Water dechlorinator/conditioner<br>  Betta food (or any food made for "tropical fish")<br>  <br>  Water should be tap water that is treated with water conditioner/dechlorinator.<br>  <br>  Bigger aquarium means more fish.<br>  You can put any fish (generally) that is not aggressive, colorful, or a known fin nipper.  Of course, compatibility depends on the betta as well.  Some bettas are more tolerant than others.<br>  <br>  Here's the long answer:<br>  2.5+ gallon tank.  Not a bowl.  Bowls are terrible, terrible, terrible.  Contrary to the popular belief, bettas do not prefer nor do they like bowls.  Unless the bowls are 2.5+ gallons and are able to fit a heater and filter (which are only a few), the bowls are not okay.<br>  <br>  While a betta does not need a heater or filter to survive, it is most definetely recommended.  It will improve water quality and lengthen the life span of your betta.  Without them, it's a lot easier for your betta to get sick.  The filter should be a sponge filter.  Any regular filter is too powerful.  Bettas prefer still water.  They take oxygen from the air rather than using their gills.  You can imagine how hard that would be if water was sploshing around every where, can't you? =]<br>  <br>  Bottled water is inferior to tap water.  Use tap water (the one from your sink).  It contains many minerals that's good for the fish.  The only problem is the chlorine in it, which can easily be fixed by adding dechlorinator/conditioner.<br>  <br>  Food is kind of self explanatory. =]<br>  <br>  You can generally put with male bettas female guppies (males are too colorful and may be mistaken for another betta), various tetras, platys, and swordtails.  The bigger the aquarium, the more chances they'll get along.  Even the most docile betta will become aggressive if it has to fight for space.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Technically we can drink tap water from the sink, and using this water is fine so long as you use water conditioner.<br>  <br>  At least a 2.5 aquarium, a gentle filter, and an aquarium heater is necessary for a betta.<br>  <br>  If you wish, bettas can be great community fish, so long as the fish chosen to be with them are compatible. Buying a ten gallon aquarium will give you the option of adding more fish in the future.

29Um8OCvaa	Actually, most feeder fish (which is what you have) get to be about 12-14 inches long, so you'll need a 25 gallon AT LEAST, and that's the bare minimum.

Just to give you more of an idea of what will happen if you keep him in a small tank - his growth will be seriously stunted, meaning - his organs will keep growing, but not his body. As a result, your goldfish will only live for a couple of years instead of 20 or 30.<br>  <br>  Cheers!|`|AA10344737	That 32 cent goldfish you got could potentially grow up to 2 feet and live for 20 years or more, depending if you take care of it correctly.<br>  <br>  Goldfish actually require at least 20g for the first fish and then at least 10g additional per extra fish.  They produce a lot of ammonia in their waste and are very dirty fish.<br>  <br>  A good treat would be tubifix worms, brine shrimp, bloodworms, etc either live or frozen.  These can be purchased at petco or an independent animal store. <br>  <br>  Make sure you have a heavy duty filter on your tank.  Cleaner water=healthier fish.|`|TjLCnxkKaa	Kept in the bowl he probably wont get much bigger than his present size.<br>  <br>   Get the largest tank you can afford, including filter, gravel etc.<br>  <br>   Common goldfish can grow to over 1 foot and live over 20 years given the space and water quality needed, however in a small tank they will be stunted and their lifespan greatly reduced.

And they eat anything pretty much|`|n5VnN73raa	Believe it or not, it is the single tailed goldfish that grow the largest! They need more space than the fancy goldfish because they are stronger and faster swimmers. You need to keep it in at least a 10 gallon. As stated above the little guy or gal is going to get big. <br>  You can feed it veggies from time to time, blood worms, sinking pellets, but never ever bread or crackers, they swell inside the fishes stomach and can kill your fish. Keeping a steady diet is best, really the store bought food are the way to go, they are made for the fish and will keep it at its healthiest.|`|Si3N2X90aa	I have a 10 gallon tank that I purchased from Petsmart for about $35 on sale. It came with everything that I needed except for gravel and decorations. It even came with some goldfish flakes and water conditioner to put in the tap water. <br>  <br>  When you are in the pet store, look for Freeze Dried Bloodworm;  or some Freeze Dried Baby Shrimp. You may need to crush them up a little pet because they may be too big. You could try some peas with the skins removed and some leafy vegetables. <br>  <br>  Think about getting some more goldfish. Goldfish can easily and fast pollute a tank, but even just a few more would not hurt.|`|XF1ctbrkaa	at .32 I'm thinking you are referring to the feeder comets..   (the biggest ones petsmart has are .26).. <br>  These can get HUGE.. <br>  <a href="http://www.aqualandpetsplus.com/Live%20F213.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aqualandpetsplus.com/Live%20F...</a><br>  that is one that was kept in a pond, so was given a chance to grow fully..  <br>  <br>  I've seen some that were over 12 inches long before..|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	One goldfish needs at least 20 gallons with a very strong filter
AA10455526	A. l have a pair of sun conure's that react the same they bite their babies to force them to stay safe under them when they feel threatened and no matter how none threatened they are before breeding season it always changes after. So basically she is trying to protect them from you you are an intruder to her nest...<br>  B. Same bird cut her toe not sure how used cue tip and cleaned area with peroxide and rinsed with water and applied neo sporn after talk to some local breeders in my area and they said l did good needless to say her toe healed really fast..|`|OyNJTWaiaa	My serious answer to this is<br>  REMOVE THE CHICKS ............no parent at all is better than a parent that attacks its own babies. <br>  Pull the chicks and foster them to another hen with chicks or hand raise them. The hen either doesnt have the right temperament to be a mother or she is sick or fed up and tired to be the best she can be right now.<br>  Cuts on chicks in nests is highly prone to infection as nests are poopy. <br>  Remove the chicks. I dont know why you havent already.
8XxMQyksaa	heck yess, adalusians are famous for their manes, just wash it every month and keep it nice, clean, braid it (helps it grow) and comb it alot!!<br>  <br>  :))|`|LAXxaxAZaa	It really depends on the horse. Some will, some won't. I'm guessing it's mostly due to not being cared for properly. Ask to see photos of the sire and dam. If they have long, thick manes and tails, you can safely assume that the horse will also have a long thick mane and tail... with proper care.<br>  <br>  Another thing... Andalusians mature much slower than other breeds. A 6-year-old Andalusian is equivelant to about a 3 or 4-year-old Quarter Horse. So their manes are probably not even close to finished growing.|`|8bTder08aa	The truth is, at least some of the photos you see of Andalusians with long, thick, flowing manes and tails are of horses that have had their manes and tails augmented artificially.|`|bab6060e2ef3646bb2232cead47e2b3daa	Someone said to comb it alot- all that does is pulls out all the hairs and makes it thin. I never brush my horses tail. <br>  I keep his mane pulled so I brush it sometimes, I don't mind if hairs are pulled out.<br>  <br>  Applying virgin coconut oil once a week will help.<br>  <br>  I think you can also apply MTG to the tailbone to help with growth.<br>  <br>  Tails seem to grow incredibly slow..|`|AA10776535	I have a Andyx he will be 1 in April...He has the thickest beautiful mane, it amazes me every time i see him.  I have seen some that naturally don't have a lot of mane, with a cross you never know, i got lucky.  My guy is graying, 4 matching white socks and a black mane and tail...He is a beauty.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Just like human hair, horse hair continues to grow throughout their lives. You will have to be willing to take extra care with the mane and tail though (Ex: bagging it up) so that it doesn't break off.|`|RloOJ43haa	They can grow if you take careful care of them. After all, it's hair. Hair seems to be a pretty shallow reason to reject a horse.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	Yes, a horse's mane will grow out.  However, typically when a horse is being shown in dressage or over fences they will have their mane pulled to about 4-6" in length.  Best wishes!|`|I66g7igDaa	A horse's main and tale are just like that of a human with careful conditioning, trimming/ pulling, and a lot of care & work you can make the main what ever you want.|`|nXxdvgwLaa	I think Andalusians have longer manes than most horses. I'm sure they will grow out more than they already are.
B6zl0AJDaa	Sadly for that amount of money what's you're getting is a saddle made in India.  The leather and craftsmanship are REALLY inferior.<br>  <br>  For your money, it's best go to ebay and check out a gently used Stubben, Crosby or Crump.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sporting-goods.shop.ebay.com/items/All-Purpose__stubben-saddle_W0QQ_catrefZ1QQ_flnZ1QQ_fromfsbZQQ_sacatZ111280QQ_trksidZp3286Q2ec0Q2em282" rel="nofollow">http://sporting-goods.shop.ebay.com/item...</a>|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Oh I love greenhawk stores.<br>  Vala- I have heard nothing but good about that brand.<br>  I like that saddle alot.  I ride dressage, that saddle would look silly in dressage, but yes, i suggest that you go ahead and buy that.  I think they have a good return policy, too, if it doesn't work like you think it would.  But I think its a good brand and saddle.|`|xi6avrGgaa	ya its good. If you want Horse saddles, western saddles, English saddles, Pony saddles, then i have a good reference for you. Visit the site saddleonline.com for getting saddles online in a cheap price.|`|BiUNuyfFaa	I think that will position your leg a little wrong... sorry|`|psNR7hDJaa	I regularly shop at greenhawk and I like that saddle. It seems pretty good, just my opinion.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	love it!|`|peDwXmQJaa	I have a friend who LOVES hers, it did take a while to beak in though.
UFn9eMYvaa	when hamsters are babies, they are very energetic. He probably just grew out of his baby stage. Also, hamsters are nocturnal, so there's a good chance he is up when you're asleep. Because he is still eating and drinking, he is definitely still healthy.|`|EzxeHsLHaa	Is it maybe very cold where his cage stands? Sometimes that "petrifies" them.<br>  <br>  Also, how old is he? Usually, when they get older, they are not quite as active any more. I think he will be alright though. Usually animals know what's best for them, but you might want to take in consideration that they only live for 2 years or so.|`|QrPKC7sPaa	same here with my hamster. She always did this. How old is your hamster? When my hamster hit 2 years, she started acting like an old granny and doing this xD It's just a hamster thing and yes, he prolly gets up when you go to bed.
YRJFo6K0aa	He looks like healthy, happy little fellow in the picture, though many of the health issues that tortoises could have would not show up easily in a photograph. Just take him to the vet for checkups just like any animal you are responsible for, make sure he's on a healthy diet and kept in an appropriate habitat, and make sure you know his normal behavior and appearance you'll know if anything unusual ever happens. If you haven't already, I would suggest getting a book and learning more about your pet -for his sake and for fun! They're cool little critters :-)|`|7Q7qHw5raa	i think your tortoise looks fine dont worry about it he looks just like any other tortoise|`|bOtk6QfIaa	Yah its so cute I love turtles!<br>  Hes BIG|`|tgROmqffaa	he looks healthly.  He doesn't have any bad markings on his shell such as soft spots or anything like that.  His eyes look bright and hes holding his head high and moving around.  He looks like hes in good shape and he'll continue to be your pet for a long time.
BkJ7pxQZaa	Almost all of my friends have 1 including myself, as we live in Wisconsin where it is also wet and cold. I personally LOVE my wintec both English and western are super comfortable and you never have to worry about rain, snow or water crossings. So far none of the 5 saddles I know of have had problems and are extremely durable.|`|3bzaDhReaa	I have had my western wintec for five years.  It is light and easy to clean. If you get one in brown it is hard to tell from leather unless you pinch it.  I have had an assortment of old western saddles. The Wintec has been the most comfortable.  A good custom leather saddle starts at around $3200.00 so $500.00 for a Wintec is not at all bad.|`|peDwXmQJaa	Well I have had two of them and they didn't hold up very well and I take very good care of my saddles. So I would not buy one if I were you.|`|BiUNuyfFaa	Wintecs aren't good saddles. They hurt your horse and they cannot be cleaned very well.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	all wintecs at the stable I board at are hard to break in, they are hard on horses (trees are too odd-shaped) and all of it is just odd.<br>  I suggest you dont buy one.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Well, I have never tried a western Wintec (I ride english) but they tend to be cheap, crummy, low-quality saddles in general. Viewed around here as the saddle for the rider "Too-new-to-know-better".... Although hey, if it works for you and your horse I guess it works. Could you get a trial saddle? Some companies will send you a trial (After you put in a deposit, of course) saddle to try out. This saddle might be a bit banged up (They have saddles they only use for trials- they just circulate them around) but it should be the same model and you can just send it back and buy a new one.
qdtU1Q1Laa	I like GPA, IRH, and PROtector helmets. They're expensive, but I feel safer with them than I would with a Troxel. <br>  <br>  I really like Irideon breeches. They feel true to size and last a long time (I've had mine about a year, and they show no wear). <br>  <br>  I look for quality and how they fit. If you can't go custom, go with Ariats. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|uNIHqmH8aa	For all of this, it depends on what kind of riding you do and how advanced you are. <br>  <br>  Helmets:<br>  If you're English and showing I would suggest and IRH or Charles Owen.<br>  <br>  Breeches and boots:<br>  Ariat, best brand for almost anything horse.If you aren't at least thirteen and you don't show, I wouldn't suggest tall boots. In fact, I would even wait until sixteen, they are EXTREMELY expensive! Um, panty lines? What? Just deal with them, it isn't important, especially because no one cares.<br>  <br>  -Nov<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>   Don't go for style first, if that's what your focused on get out of horses and into fashion. I talk safety and function. Style comes after these are a guarantee.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	my favorite brand of helmets for everyday use are tipperary. they are sleek and light weight, super comfy and durable. as for shows, it trust international riding helmets. they are classical looking but breathable. my favorite pair of breeches are devon aire, but they tend not to hold up well for everyday use. my ariats on the other hand hold up super well, and the heavier (winter weight) ones hide panty lines. but if there are everyday breeches that hide panty lines, i'd love to know! haha as for tall boots, i look for comfort and durability. they need to last through several show seasons in order to save money. i like real leather opposed to synthetic material, because synthetic tends to break down and crack faster then leather. i also prefer spanish tops on my boots, because of the classical look. and i like to have good spur rests. normally i don't ride in spurs (at least not everyday) but when/if i use them for a competition, i need to know that my spurs will stay in place. <br>  <br>  hope this helps & good luck!|`|x787hJbBaa	I have these:<br>  An ariat helmet I have had for four and a half years that has survived four falls<br>  Devon-Aire, EQ and Tuff Rider breeches<br>  I have pleather saxons. Don't get me wrong, they're good boots, but I want a pair of ariats which I am going to buy once my feet stopped growing. I am thirteen and I wear a nine!! I jumped from a three to a six two years ago, and then a seven to a nine 6 months ago.<br>  Get boots that are comfortable, fit you well, and are correctly sized for you. I have extremely thin calves (Well, actually my whole body is thin. I am 5 feet 4 inches and 95 pounds) and slim calf boots are too loose on me. Not by much, but they are.... Sorry I rambled......|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	Well i'll give you my favorites, they aren't promised to be cheap though.<br>  <br>  helmets i prefer charles owen.<br>  breeches i prefer ariat full seat - not that im aware of, tho there are undies made for riding that are supposed to "hide" them.<br>  my favorite brand of tall boots would be hands down ariat.|`|bab6060e2ef3646bb2232cead47e2b3daa	I wear Ariat tall boots. I also had a pair of EquiComfort a while ago that I liked. <br>  <br>  I like FITS breeches. DevonAire has some nice stuff, also. I have a bunch of Elation breeches. They're fairly comfy. They don't last too long, though.|`|peDwXmQJaa	Helmets- go sunk stripe FEI all the way they are the most stylish right now.<br>  Breaches - tailored sportsmen, kerrits, and Dovers beaches are good too. No Panty lines can't be fixed unless you want to wear a thong.<br>  Tall boots - Dublin, Ariat my Favs<br>  When looking for boots hight and calf size are the biggest thing|`|HfCSNRHzaa	always make sure your helmet is SEI/ASTM approved. This is for safety. <br>  <br>  i like Kerrits rand reeches, because theyre thin and great for the summer, but pantyline is inevitable in them. If you want to avoid panty line i would suggest some full-seat breeches like these: <a href="http://www.adamshorsesupply.com/browse.cfm/4,5433.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adamshorsesupply.com/browse.c...</a><br>  <br>  adams horse supply is a great site for this type of thing. hope that helped.
ZN686EhIaa	If he is as good as you say, are you sure they want to sell him? Horses like that are pretty hard to find. Also, they are making A LOT OF MONEY out of you with the current system. If you love him to bits, then you don't need us to tell you what to do, just go and buy him! Although I would be thinking about medical insurance for vet bills if you can afford it.<br>  Only buy an advanced horse if you think you want to be more ambitious. Why be more adventurous when this horse gives you so much joy? Stick with him, make him yours.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	hes a bit old, the horse I bought (17) is just 20 now and she's ill.  I suggest a younger horse.  If he gets a good vet check, then I think he sounds good enough.<br>  He sounds like you love him, and people competing in Maclay?  wow!<br>  okay so If you love him, if your vet gives you the okay, then you should follow your heart (I'm thinking that you want to buy him) and what you want to do the most.<br>  =]<br>  It also depends on price of this guy.|`|oR9ZODGtaa	I think you should buy him. He sounds great and you could work on getting him better too. Since you have been working with him like forever you already have a good relationship so that's even better. This he doesn't have any vices, that just makes it an easier choice. If your worried about his age, don't be. He's only 18. There are lots of older horses still in the show ring too.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	if you really like him, buy him! you can always find someone that want to show there horse and needs a rider!|`|peDwXmQJaa	If you really like him then I think you should buy him|`|x787hJbBaa	If you can afford him and you won't outgrow him abilities wise for a while, buy him. I feel the same way about the horse I half lease. I love him so much, but 4 other people ride him for lessons. I want to buy him so bad but we can't afford it. Buy him if you love him, even when you outgrow him he will be your friend for life.|`|xzJi0bcSaa	If you feel like you can advance on him more and you guys get along really well and you can afford it, I dont see why not buy him, you sound like you would be giving him a much less hectic home. He is 18 and thats getting up there, not to say he doesnt have a lot left in him but, think about that. If there are other places that are good but cheaper, maybe consider moving. If you think you can get a few years more out of him but want to continue jumping competitive, maybe I would consider a younger horse. I might not be helpful but, some more things to think about if you havent already.|`|mU4pXMIeaa	the question is could you live without him, if your only leasing thats always a possibility. If the answer is no, buy him and secure your future together|`|ZAMhyAQ9aa	If you love him, you should buy him.  It makes sense financially, and if you get to a point where you want to go further than he can take you, you could either lease him out to a beginner and lease (or buy based on your financial status) another horse, or you could free lease him to someone, or sell him.  I would buy him, because then you have the ultimate say in what happens to him, and it is cheaper in the long run. If you love him and want to make sure he is happy and well taken care of his entire life, then buying him is the answer.  <br>  <br>  If you are a person that only cares about competing and jumping high and going as far as possible, then I would just keep leasing him because then when you surpass his level you can get a horse that can do more. you dont seem like this kind of person though|`|zfyOhvnNaa	I am never a fan of buying a horse at your level, in my opinion you should always look to buy a horse just beyond your capability.  It will help you learn as well as increase the amount of time both you and your horse enjoy you time together.  If not, I feel the rider is always inevitably disappointed when they are soon ready for more and there horse is holding them back, and the horse is upset because A)he's not pleasing his best friend (you) and B) the work is too hard and therefore unfun for him.<br>  <br>  If you are genuinely happy with the level your at, go for it!  But if not, or if you feel in time you may want to excel higher, appreciate and love the lease and relationship you currently have with your horse, but don't buy.  Also, at 18, he may be slowing down in the next few years and his current level may decline.  Unless you will be happy potentially performing at a lower level than you do now, I feel this may not be the horse for you.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide, and sometime the special bond you get with your horse outways other things.  Just think about it as objectively as possible and make the right choice for you!  ^^
n5VnN73raa	Some fish are just more aggressive than others. It is best to keep the males apart if they are already fighting. Just keep the set up you have.  The more fish your aggressive male has to pick on the better, that way he won't kill any of your fish or just keep harassing one. I know the feeling of walking in the pet store and seeing all those fish, and the want to buy them. ( :<br>  But I think you have solved you problem, they only think you need to worry about now is about you molly population! haha i have a feeling you are going to be a proud parent very soon. <br>  If you really want all your molly's in the same tank just watch them closely at first. I had male platy's that fought constantly but neither fish was ever harmed. Its really just the roll of the dice. <br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|FIRIiz3Zaa	Dont worry about it I have 2 male mollies and they wont kill each other or rip each other fins apart, the only thing that worries me is the 4 females, I dont have any female mollies in my tank. I would wait it out and see. Good Luck!
4XUUVDM3aa	It depends on what other exercise riders in your area are making. I agree with charging extra if the horse can be dangerous. Around here in va a ride is 25-30. It also depends on how many horses you want to ride a day and the length of time. I would charge a flat rate per horse and try to work them all for the same amount of time.|`|TTLIp8Beaa	it depends on the horses really.<br>  i would say a minimum of $30 a ride (max $50), but if the horse has bad habits, like bucking/rearing/bolting i would charge extra ($10 -$15). make sure you have legal consent to ride her horses, (as in documented proof) stating that you know you are riding at your own risk.|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	Well depending on how far you plan on taking these horses in their training i'd charge at least 40/ride.|`|MBwln1m7aa	A couple years ago I was doing something like that when I wasn't working and I was being paid about $20 or $30 for each horse I rode and I'd generally ride for about an hour, maybe 2.<br>  When I started breaking in a 3 year old I was paid double for each session with him.<br>  I discussed with them what they wanted done with their horses and how often and then I let them decide what they thought was fair and what they could afford. If they couldn't afford to pay me for whatever reasons I was paid in horse tack which was great coz my riding boots fell apart and I got a free pair!<br>  By the end of the month I was able to pay my phone bill and public transport costs to go to job interviews so I was happy with that!|`|47Sn5nnxaa	I think you should do minimum wage hourly, PER horse . That would be enough
AA11938604	Okay; Let's say the instructions are as follows:  Mix one part sugar to two parts water.  That means for every measure of sugar you use in your mixture, you mix TWO equal parts of water.  Example: One cup sugar to two cups water.  Or if you want to make a bigger batch, mix one pail of sugar to two pails of water.  A "Part" is any unit of measure you want, just so long as the other "part" is of equal measurement.  <br>  If the instructions say 1 part water to 1 part sugar, just add equal amounts of sugar and water (a cup of each).<br>  If the instructions say 3 parts sugar to 1 part water, then it would be 3 cups of sugar to 1 cup of water.  Or for a bigger batch; 3 gallons of sugar to 1 gallon of water.<br>  As for the food coloring, just add enough to give it a nice red color without overdoing it.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I'd recommend the water be hot when you mix the sugar so it dissolves easier and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved.  Add the food coloring last.  Let it cool down before putting it in the feeder.|`|u5S5jc88aa	i was told the red dye is not good for hummingbird,  unsure why so you might want to leave the red dye out.  i know for sure its not necessary they will still come to it i have 5 in my backyard at a feeder and there is no dye|`|iJtuhLMTaa	You shouldn't add food coloring.  The mixture for humming bird feed is 1 part sugar to 4 parts water.  Basically what that means is for every 1 cup of water as 1/4 cup of sugar.

K8t1lPXsaa	make your dog lay down. look where your dog is looking and hold a treat on the opposite side, just a little behind the head. it should turn to look for the treat which will most likely make the dog roll half half way. when it rolls on it's back praise it|`|4KTe107Yaa	really easy. U said ur dog can lay down. Next step tell her to roll over and you actually roll her over. She will learn to do it herself eventually. Just praise her everytime she comes close and also when you do it for her. Should take her 10 minutes to learn. Ans do it alot once she does it on her own.

K8t1lPXsaa	don't fall into the "teacup" scam.  yorkies are born small. the standard yorkie doesn't get bigger than 7 pounds. it's not recommended to buy a yorkie under 3 pounds. <br>  <br>  pros<br>  <br>  They love being near you be it by your side, in your lap or at your feet. they will always be happy when you come home<br>  <br>  they're little so they don't need as much exercise. 15-30 min is usually more than enough, <br>  <br>  they don't eat much food so one normal sized bag will last at least a month<br>  <br>  they like to please and can easily learn new tricks (my yorkie knew his name and responded to it the same night i brought him home. he knew how to sit on command by the second day)<br>  <br>  they make good watch dogs and will alert you when they sense someone.<br>  <br>  all dogs shed but yorkies don't shed much. most of their hair will only come out when being brushed and combed. <br>  <br>  -cons<br>  <br>  the biggest problem is yorkies can be very stubborn so potty training can be very difficult. most yorkie owners will need to invest in a crate and belly bands to avoid accidents. you'll need to stick to a very tight schedule so your yorkie gets in the habit of going outside to potty. <br>  <br>  grooming and teeth cleaning. if a yorkie has problem having it's adult teeth come in it will need to see a vet so the baby teeth can be pulled. you need to brush their teeth regularly to avoid tooth decay. if their teeth rot the vet will have to pull them out and the dog will only be able to eat canned food. <br>  <br>  in the "puppy" cut, the way you see yorkie puppies their coat is easy to manage. you have to brush and comb them every other day to avoid matting and they need to be washed either once a week or every other week. their ear hair needs to be plucked. <br>  <br>  they can be yappy but they can be taught not to bark or to only bark when necessary-my yorkie only barks when someone is at the door. as soon as i get up to see who it is he's quiet.<br>  <br>  yorkies aren't a breed that do well being left alone for extended periods of time. they are more likely to develop separation anxiety. if you're away from home more than 6 hours a day many suggest getting a second dog to to keep the yorkie company.<br>  <br>  many people want "teacup" yorkies. These are runt yorkies who are usually very sickly and injure easily. yorkies and other small breeds can easily get hypoglycemia(low blood sugar). even more common with the "teacups". this becomes less of a risk when it reaches a year old but it is still a risk<br>  <br>  this is a breed that will need a dog sweater in the winter(i don't know if that is a pro or a con). you don't have to go overboard with the clothing if you don't want to. one sweater and a rain coat should be just fine.|`|IdSqunZuaa	I decided to share with you this link, <a href="http://dogtime.com/yorkshire-terrier.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/yorkshire-terrier.htm...</a> instead.

xRaGyugTaa	coucouc angel , désolé mais je n ai aucune idée mais j'ai fait une petite recherche sur le net , je te donne ce que j ai trouvé et j'espère t'avoir aider <br>  On estime qu’environ 1 chien sur 500 souffre de diabète. Rassurez-vous, vous n’êtes pas le seul ma?tre à avoir un chien diabétique! <br>  <br>  Le métabolisme du glucose chez le chien non-diabétique<br>  <br>  La nourriture se désintègre en composants que le corps utilise. La conversion des hydrates de carbone (amidon) donne des sucres et notamment du glucose. Une fois passé à travers la paroi intestinale, le glucose circule dans le sang et fournit de l’énergie aux cellules du corps. <br>  <br>  Le passage du glucose dans la plupart des cellules dépend de la présence d'une hormone, l'insuline. L’insuline est produite par une glande spécifique appelée pancréas, qui se situe près des intestins. <br>  Qu’est-ce que le diabète sucré?<br>  <br>  Le diabète sucré est d? à un manque en insuline disponible.<br>  <br>  Les causes du diabète chez le chien: <br>  <br>  Le pancréas des chiens diabétiques ne produit pas suffisamment d’insuline<br>  Les cellules du corps n’arrivent pas à répondre à l’insuline<br>  Les conséquences du diabète chez le chien:<br>  <br>  Une incapacité de la part des cellules à absorber suffisamment de glucose <br>  Des concentrations en glucose bien trop élevées dans le sang<br>  Tous les chiens sont-ils susceptibles de souffrir de diabète sucré? <br>  <br>  L'affection atteint plus volontiers les chiens d’age moyen et les chiens agés. Les femelles non-castrées sont les plus touchées. <br>  <br>  Les races qui semblent conna?tre un risque accru de diabète sucré sont : <br>  <br>  spitz-loup <br>  caniche <br>  samoyède <br>  teckels<br>  malamute d’Alaska <br>  schnauzer nain <br>  chow-chow <br>  beagle <br>  doberman <br>  labrador retriever<br>  puli <br>   golden retriever <br>  pinscher nain <br>  bobtail <br>  cocker anglais <br>  schipperke<br>  berger finnois de Laponie <br>  west Highland white terrier (westie)<br>  cairn terrier<br>  <br>  <br>  une 2 recherche <br>  Quel traitement ?<br>  <br>  En ce qui concerne le traitement d'un animal diabétique, il varie suivant le stade de la maladie.<br>  <br>  1. Lorsque l'animal se trouve en état prédiabétique, des mesures alimentaires sont mises en place. <br>  En effet, un régime hypoglucidique et hyperprotidique avec une quantité de fibres importante s'avère nécessaire pour limiter l'apport de graisses et de sucres dont l'excès aggrave la maladie.<br>  <br>  Dans les stades précoces de la maladie ou lorsque le diabète est peu grave, on peut utiliser des comprimés qui diminuent le taux de sucre dans le sang (sulfamides hypoglycémiants par exemple). <br>  Mais, ces médicaments sont rarement suffisamment puissants et sont parfois mal tolérés par le chien.<br>  <br>  2. Lorsque le diabète est déclaré ou assez grave (glycémie élevée, glycosurie, prise de boisson augmentée ...), un traitement à l'aide d'injections d'insuline est nécessaire.<br>  L'insuline est le meilleur moyen de traiter un diabète sucré.<br>  <br>  Le vétérinaire ajuste d'abord la dose nécessaire à l'animal, ce qui peut prendre plusieurs jours. Puis doit s'effectuer ensuite un suivi régulier qui est fondamental pour le traitement, les besoins en Insuline pouvant changer au fur et à mesure du temps.<br>  <br>  Il faut en effet réaliser des injections d'insuline une fois (avec de l'insuline retard) ou deux fois (avec de l'insuline semi-retard) par jour et ceci durant toute la vie de l'animal.<br>  Il faut absolument respecter du mieux possible les heures d'injections de l'insuline et d'administration des repas (qui se fait au même moment).<br>  L'alimentation doit être adaptée : un régime avec des fibres, peu de sucres rapides et beaucoup de protéines de haute qualité (ce sont elles qui constituent désormais la source d'énergie de votre chien).<br>  <br>  Si le traitement n'est pas bien respecté, le chien risque de faire ce que l'on appelle un coma diabétique (forte baisse de l'état général, vomissements, ...) qui débouche sur la mort de l'animal si aucun traitement n'est mis en place.<br>  <br>  Le traitement à l'insuline est donc indispensable pour la survie d'un chien diabétique.<br>  <br>  3. De plus, il faut veiller au poids du chien car l'obésité est un facteur aggravant.<br>  mais je te conseille de consultr un médecin|`|L7n3YZe1aa	jamais entendu, le veterinaire est mieux placer|`|XqXMJyi6aa	A yadh, ce n'est pas la question, si tu as les nerfs, passes les ailleurs!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Quant au diabète, ma chienne (malinois) en a eu et mon grand-père lui a fait une piq?re tous les soirs jusqu'à sa mort (?a a duré 5 ans) elle n'était pas aveugle mais pas loin et n'a jamais souffert! <br>  Mes grands parents avaient eu un chien aveugle qui n'a jamais souffert non plus!

Your cat's eyes are irreplaceable and once her sight is gone, it's gone for good. You need to have the cat examined by a vet so he can accurately diagnose her.  She could have a cut in her eye, the start of a URI, feline herpes, or a number of other ailments.  Putting drops in her eyes without vet approval can make things much worse. The vet usually gives an eye ointment for this along with oral antibiotics if infection is detected.  Most every cat is infected with Feline Herpes.  Ask your vet about L-lysine supplements to help if he feels this is the cause of the flare ups.  Don't put off having the vet take a look.  Your cat deserves proper care.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=chronicherpesconjunctivitis" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|SWv7QWzKaa	You seemed to be doing all the right things with the compresses. <br>  <br>  Maybe your local pet store has an eye wash for cats?

9kceDOTraa	Males are supposed to be yellow yes, but are you sure they came from those Kenyi?  Did you actually see the fry going in and out of the mothers mouth?  If they did, since I have seen your photos, I can tell you this much.  It means you have a hybrid.  There is no male Kenyi in all your shots, nor any Jack Dempsey unless the shots you posted don't show every fish in the tank?  Most likely, I think the Kenyi crossed with the Flavus.  In this case, I wouldn't do anything to help the fry.<br>  <br>  Cross breeds in Africans and pretty much cichlids in general are highly discouraged as well as worthless, except for something like an OB peacock.  Not much you can really do at this point, but keep in mind this.  If you intend to grow out and raise that hybrid, DO NOT SPAWN IT BACK WITH ANYTHING.  What you'll end up doing is introducing some screwed up bloodlines down the road and really piss off some hobbyist that will have no idea this Kenyi carries Flavus genes in it, and you wouldn't want that done to you.  Take measures to prevent the hybridization now and don't isolate that fry.  At some point in time, a male will get it and take care of it naturally.  It sounds harsh or mean, but it's a fact of life.  In the wild, MANY fry are eaten by males in African. This isn't a fish you want to raise to adulthood.
xLNzdxsOaa	Horses crib mostly as a result of boredom. Some scientists are saying that it might be an inherited behavior, or a result of OCD, but this hasn't been proven. It mostly effects stalled horses, but I know some horses who are in large outdoor paddocks and still crib.<br>  Cribbing is  addictive, like a drug, because when they suck in air a chemical is released in their brain, which activates the horse's pleasure center and suppresses pain. They get high off of it, and once they've discovered it it's pretty hard to convince them to stop. I've heard that the feed supplement Quitt helps some people, maybe try researching that?|`|px27V5N9aa	We had a stud colt start cribbing.<br>  We are not sure if it was because he was stalled next to a cribber or he just needed more time out, more than the others.  Boredom caused him to give it a try.<br>  The other 30 horses never cribbed.....until after he sold and a filly started doing it. Again not much pasture time.  Bored to death.<br>  <br>  Even when turned out into a herd of 8 others in 20 acres she wanted to do nothing but crib.  She did it so much she quit eating and her eyes were 'glazed' and she started losing weight.  She was 'high' all of the time on the endorphin rush she got.<br>  <br>  Now Cribbing and chewing are different.<br>  Cribbing is when they push their teeth on a solid area, arch their neck and suck wind in.  They don't chew wood but they can wear it down with their front incisors!  Crib collars are about the only thing that will help unless you get lucky and get one that stops just by giving him 24/7 turnout.<br>  Wood Chewers just go around munching on wood.  Paint the wood with Chew Stop and it will help a few days.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I've had cribbers, and there is no cure. Some tools manage it, but it never goes away. First, it affects their teeth. The constant use of the teeth to crib creates problems there. We have been able to manage our cribbers, with no weight loss and all that. It also can damage fences, barns, or whatever they can get their teeth on. But, I do agree with the above poster, if there is one inch of a spot in a wide open space where they can crib, they will find it.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	What is Horse Cribbing and How can I get my Horse to STOP?<br>  <br>  WHAT IS CRIBBING? <br>  <br>  Do you know that CRIBBING is not only rough on barns and fences, but it also may be detrimental to a horse's health? The horse wears down his teeth and swallows air, which can lead to inappropriate digestion and colic. Cribbing can lead to serious health problems, such as poor digestion, colic, and various dental problems. <br>  <br>  Cribbing is an obsessive-compulsive behavior when a horse chews on wood and swallows air. The cribber uses its upper teeth to grab a stationary object, such as a fence board, and then arches its neck, pulls backwards while swallowing air and grunting. Other horses crib by resting their incisors on an object without grasping it; still others rest their chin on an object and swallow air. <br>  <br>  WHY DO HORSES CRIB?<br>  <br>  It's not known what causes cribbing in horses.<br>  <br>  There appears to be an inherited susceptibility to STRESS in horses, so genetics are part of the answer. When a horse cribs, it is believed that his body releases endorphins, which stimulate the pleasure center of his brain as why it is such an addictive habit, and such a hard one to break. This may explain why horses crib when under stress, as well. A horse's INABILITY TO GRAZE can be a significant stress that is commonly thought to lead to repetitive cribbing behavior. <br>  <br>  IMPROPER DIET AND FEEDING PRACTICES are commonly cited as factors that may lead to cribbing. Improper diet and feeding is also thought to contribute to cribbing, perhaps because it may cause a horse more stress.<br>  <br>  Another popular theory is that cribbing is due to BOREDOM, AND LACK OF EXERCISE. Horses kept stalled are more likely to become Cribbers than horses that are allowed to roam in a pasture. Semi-wild horses or horses in the wild or in the pasture naturally spend 90% of their time grazing and are less likely to crib.<br>  <br>  Every horse handles stress differently, some better than others. It appears that susceptibility to stress in horses is INHERITED, so genetics may play a part also. <br>  <br>  WHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR A CRIBBER? <br>  <br>  Food - Horses need to eat throughout the day and keep their minds active lest they become bored and stressed, since boredom is the most common reason why a horse will pick up the cribbing habit.<br>  <br>  Cribbing Straps - Crib straps aren't perfect but they do succeed in suppressing many cribbers, so it's an inexpensive option that's worth a try.<br>  <br>  Electro-Shock Collars - These collars are worn around the upper neck just like a crib strap; the strap emits an electric shock to shock the horse each time he takes hold of a fence to crib. <br>  <br>  Electric Fencing - Stringing electric fencing along the top of any paddock and/or pasture fences is an effective way to stop them from cribbing on fences. Electric fencing is highly encouraged since it will effectively stop cribbing in its tracks on the protected locations. <br>  <br>  Chew Stop And Related Products - Some Non-Toxic Products are now available in the market. These can be sprayed or painted on popular cribbing areas to lend a very unappetizing taste and smell, thereby discouraging a cribber from taking hold of the area. These products are typically recognized as the most humane and cost effective methods to stop your horse from cribbing.<br>  <br>  Surgical Procedure - This procedure entails cutting some of the muscles and nerves in the ventral neck region as well as the removal of some muscle tissue. <br>  <br>  Anti-depressant - It is an injected to the animal, which prohibits the creation of endorphins, thereby suppressing the natural high a horse gains when he cribs. This is not a practical solution since the effects are short-lived, but further research is being done on similar drugs that may have a longer lasting effect. <br>  <br>  MORE TIPS AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES<br>  <br>  Once a horse starts cribbing it is difficult to get them to stop. The best thing is to try to distract and prevent it from occurring in the first place. One of the most common aids in breaking your horse from the cribbing habit are: <br>  -Allow your horse as much pasture time, in as big a pasture as possible<br>  -Spend time training and handling the horse to help prevent boredom. <br>  -Provide your horse with a companion, preferably another horse, but goats also often make good companions for horses. <br>  -Distract your horse with multiple feedings; pasture time and toys before the habit becomes ingrained. <br>  -Allow your horse access to fresh grass, or grass hay at all times.<br>  <br>  To date we know of no proof or studies that indicate a horse learns to crib from being around a cribber, and it is likely that several factors come in to play to cause this disorder.<br>  <br>  Finally, if your horse suddenly picks up cribbing and doesn't seem to have developed it from one of the normal causes, it would be a good idea to ask your veterinarian to check your horse and make sure there isn’t a medical cause for the cribbing. <br>  <br>  For more helpful information on cribbing please visit www.horse-cribb|`|wi1klRdMaa	Some horses crib from boredom, but some crib because they are in pain. I would suggest getting a vet check and an equine dentist check to make sure your horse isn't in some kind of pain. As for finding a way to stop it, there are several supplements on the market.

I had a quarter horse who had a large meadow to graze in, as well as a pasture buddy, and she managed to find the only piece of lumber in the area (a single piece of board connected to the gate) to stand there and crib.  It was rediculous!  There is no cure.  Trust me, I tried. Nothing works!  Except maybe hunger. She would stop for a few minutes to snack when I threw some flakes of hay in the pasture.
WEl6BvXOaa	Being the leader is basically all a state of mind. Certain horses just have the "lead horse" personality and they make their presence known in the field so that all the other horses know. They tend to be more assertive and may even be aggressive when it comes to food, companions, and their place in line.
px27V5N9aa	The alpha needs to be:<br>  <br>  1.  Strong<br>  Has demonstrated that he can 'take on' any other horse there in a fight and win.  He has the muscle and athleticism over the others.  He may also show that his 'muscle' is in the way he plans his strategy and out maneuvers the opponent before he can be out muscled.<br>   <br>  2.  Confident<br>  Willing to be the first out in front on their hunt for food. <br>  Steps up to an opponent and is sure of himself.<br>  Commands the others with no hesitation.<br>  <br>  3.  Attentive to details<br>  Knows where everyone is or close to it.<br>  Aware if someone is too close to his 'grazing' area and lets them know before they even get there.<br>  Hears every crack of twig and alerts others by snorts or flagging his tail with head high.  First to run to tell others LETS GO..FOLLOW ME! and picks the direction<br>  <br>  Now..I had a herd that was run by a tough old mare.  She was mean to the others and herded them around. <br>  When the chips were down though the herd ignored her and focused on another mare, the third in command.  SHE was the true herd alpha.  She was soft and lenient but well respected and when she was needed to take over in the times of trouble, she was elected.<br>  So our herd had TWO herd mares.<br>  <br>  The herd alpha gets to choose which pile of hay or spot of grass he gets to eat from.  He'll walk up to a horse, pin his ears as he's doing so and that horse will flick her tail, pin her ears and walk away from him.  He's dominant over her.  <br>  If he is ever moved away from a spot, he is NOT alpha.<br>  <br>  Herd dynamics will change from one day to the next so you should pay close attention.  One day the second in command could have fallen to the third due to a squabble that left her less dominant.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	The leader cares for all of its herd-mates.<br>  It's a huge job, my horse is the leader, and sometimes during late fall I see him pouting because the grass isn't as rich and its more scarse.<br>  That is part of being a leader.  The horses like being leader, but its hard for them.<br>  I think its great to be at a barn where all of the horses are together.  it resembles a real herd situation.<br>  Also, the leader makes sure that everyone stays in their positions (the bottom of the pecking order cannot boss around one higher than them.<br>  Again, its a tough job, but its fun too.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|u1HahCoqaa	The "leader" as you put it, basically should be watching out for the herd. They are the ones you often will see watching and spooking while the others eat. They can basically get the best of  what is there, because they can boss the others away. They gain the position basically by fighting their way to the top- also, if it was a stallion, he gains top breeding rights. However, the top mare or stallion or gelding is always challenged by some individuals, just like human societies (There is always the leader-type who isn't, and will fight the current) and everytime you add another animal it messes up the social order.<br>  <br>  For riding I have noticed that the Alpha-type horse is more headstrong. Not braver, although sometimes that is true as well.|`|xLNzdxsOaa	I don't know what your situation's like, but my horse is the boss at my barn's mini herd, and he doesn't really do much as a leader. He chases the others around and gets first pick of food/shelter/etc. I personally think it's just the most confident/intimidating horse, and they're asserting their position as boss. If he's scared, that's probably his personality, and all horses are always looking for grass. Because that's what they're born to do. Hope that helps, that's just the way I see it.|`|x787hJbBaa	The leader eats first, always runs at the head of the herd, and can "boss" the other horses around without getting hurt. My horse is third in 6 horses and he gets bit and kicked by the two above him. He still is higher up then my friend's horse. He's at the bottom of the pack, which is funny because both my horse and another horse are newer then he is.|`|dBRxfRGqaa	leaders are confindent, they are trusted and respected by the herd members. you say he gets scared easy, but what you don't say is does he get scared around you or when he's alone or with the herd? if he gets scared when he is with you, that means you are not truly the leader. you know your horse trusts you when he spooks and calms down within a second after he relises that you are there. the fact that he is always looking for grass, i'm guessing when he's with you, tells me that he doesn't have total respect for you. if he did, his attention would be on you the whole time unless you let him graze. i'm not telling you to never let him graze when he's with you, just make sure it's your idea when he does.|`|3O6CTb3saa	The leader is established through the pecking order as we call it.  And that usually boils down to the one horse who is big enough, strong enough to fight off everybody else or to at least buffalo them.  Once he has become the leader he is looked up to and expected to alert the herd to danger. (Just like a stud would do).  He is the one that will lead them to water and to good patches of grass to eat.  Beings he is the leader of the herd you need to make sure he realizes that you are the boss of him and not let him become the Alpha to you.|`|TblG3s89aa	a leader eats first and can push another horse away if that horse has something he wants and then the other horse can just give it up or fight for it, in which case the horse that wins is dominant over the other.<br>  as for the grass your the leader is looking for food for the horse and as for getting scared the leader can and is challenged at any time their fore he must be ready also he must look out for the whole herd their fore spot dangerous quickly. the leader does everything first and can get away with taking form another horse|`|peDwXmQJaa	I have had this problem with my horse. The leader is called the boss it will normally be a mare because in the wild stallions do not travel with mares and foals. Geldings are normally lower in rank because mares are mean.<br>  If your horse is the boss and you are having dominance issues then you need to take it out of that situation, that will likely solve the grass problems.|`|rz9uM9Gpaa	My horse is also the leader of her herd, their main goal is to provide for the herd. If they can't find water, food, and shelter they are questioned as a good enough leader. If the herd decides the leader isn't good enough, another horse will usually try to take their place. A horse probably won't want this to happen though, which is why your horse is most likely acting this way.|`|ZN686EhIaa	The reason he gets scared easily is that he has to be more aware of dangers than the rest of the herd. So he is constantly checking everything around him. You will find the ears will be constantly active. He is always looking for grass because being 'on his toes' all the time is burning up his energy. Leaders can get a bit barn sour because they do not like to leave behind their herd, which they expect should be with them.
hIyjdXr9aa	Separate him from the other fish he's with.  One of them tore the first half of his fin off, and you don't want to give it the opportunity to tear off the other half.  <br>  Then put the goldfish in a large hospital tank and head out to the fish store and buy some anti-stress coat to put in the water and make him more comfortable.  The fish will heal if you keep the water clean.  Buy an ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate test kit and test every other day.  <br>  A twenty gallon tank or larger would help him recover best, but not many people have spare large tanks hanging around.  If you have to put him in something as small as a ten gallon (ten dollars at your local fish store.  Don't tell me it's too expensive.), at least make sure the water is always clean and treated.  Use that test kit. <br>  <br>  Good luck.  Your fish's tail will heal if you do what I just described.  What did you have it in the tank with?  Somebody tried to eat him.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Making daily water changes is actually a bad thing because such frequent changes stresses the fish.  It's better to monitor with a test kit and change the water once the levels rise.  Also remember to dechlorinate the water before adding it, and keep the water that is being added the same temperature as the water already in the tank (use a thermometer).<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel better, know that I've seen fish recover from pretty bad inuries.  I once dropped one of my fry, twice!, on the floor from a large height when I was changing the water.  It was hooooorible.  And then I was worried about all the other fry so I didn't pick this one up for like three minutes and it flopped around on the floor.  When I finally picked it up, I almost squished it (tiny fry baby fish) so I had to use toilet paper so it would adhere to the toilet paper and I could get it off the floor.  It was horrible.  I thought the fish was going to die at first.  In fact, I thought it was already dead.  My other thirty fry were all swimming around doing fine, but this one was just floating there, not moving.  Then, after I watched it for a few minutes, it started moving (jerkily and slowly).  The fish made a full recovery, I know for sure because it was the only of its species at the time I had that fry, so I  know it was this fish.  It now lives happily, almost fully grown, in my main tank.  <br>  So fish really can recover from some bad injuries.  Yours will heal if you take very good care of it.|`|H06PtiIAaa	move it to a seperate tank with a sponge filter.<br>  <br>  Make sure the water ois very clean, to avoid infections. <br>  <br>  You will need to do a 15% water change everyother day to keep water clean.<br>  <br>  Treat with medications to prevent infections and then add some aquarium salt in the aquarium, to help it heal.<br>  <br>  it is a 5050 chance, but avoiding infections is key if you havent figured that out yet.
sdOMcaI9aa	I use Flukers DIGITAL hygrometer and thermometers...dials are unreliable.|`|oUTb1zNkaa	I mostly use the flukers. Make sure it's in an appropriate spot. If it's just hanging on the side of the tank you're not really getting the tanks temp and humidity but the air directly around the guage.
Bpc1kPqpaa	You must distract the snake. Get a branch and be sure the snake is looking at it. In one motion, grab the snake's tail and put the stick on its neck (with some pressure). Then, with your other hand, grab the snake's neck, but be cautious that it can't bite you. If you don't really want to do that, tip a garbage can on its side and sweep it in.|`|b9610cdca9c953260b26bc2dd476eab7aa	most snakes wont eat in captivity theres a very good chance it will die...go buy one|`|2qgg2G8kaa	Well you could grab it by the tail and catch it that way. I don't really know a great way because I don't chase after wild snakes. I don't see your point in catching a grass snake. If you catch it and keep it, it won't live long. Since it is a wild snake it isn't used to being in captivity and may not eat the food given to it. They don't like being in a tank where they can't get around. Best not to catch one.

I used to have that cage for my rats! It is very big...but there are MANY MANY MANY cons about it.<br>  <br>  First of all, it is SOOO hard to clean and the shelves are just a PAIN because they don't come out once you put them in and it is so hard to clean it is unbelievable.<br>  <br>  Second of all, my rats CHEWED right through the plastic and escaped about 4-5 times, literally. They ate all this stuff that was bad for them including chocolate, a suction cup, plastic, MONEY, tissue, stickers, etc. <br>  <br>  They could also push the doors open and escape.<br>  <br>  It was a truely horrible cage. Please do not get it! After I threw away that cage, I bought the Ferret Nation Model #141 or #142 I can't remember. I had to modify it because numerous people said rats could fit through the bars. It was ok except my rats started gnawing at the plastic pan at the bottom.<br>  <br>  PLEASE try to find a cage with a metal base!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Three year olds can be shown in hand.<br>  <br>  British Hunter classes come in several categories:-<br>  Novice (snaffle bridle), Small, Lightweight, Mediumweight and Heavyweight, depending on their bone.  There is also Ladies Hunter - ridden sidesaddle.  ALL Hunters are expected to gallop on the go-round, behave impeccably when ridden by the Judge which will include an extension and have excellent conformation, immaculate turnout (rat-catcher) and perfect manners.  They are also expected to 'strip' and trot-up in front of the Judge for him/her to assess it's conformation and movement.<br>  <br>  As a previous post has said, Hunter classes here do not include jumping.

The horse might look great on it's own. But if the rider is not well enough to handle him or her, the whole look goes downhill. If a rider cannot give correct cues, then the horse becomes confused. And if the rider's legs and arms are all over the place, the horse can become irritated. Basically, in the end, everything becomes quite a mess.<br>  <br>  So make sure that you and your horse are fully prepared. Decide on a show you want to enter, and really practice for it. Make sure you and your horse are a good match, and that you can handle him easily with no major problems.<br>  <br>  Normally, it is more based on the horse, yes. But it is just as important that the rider is good.<br>  <br>  Other basic tips for shows-<br>  <br>  1. Plan ahead of time on what level show you want to enter, and prepare for it well.<br>  2. Make sure your horse, not only you, is ready and not too stressed to be showed in a higher level.<br>  3. Make a list before going to the actual show. Do not forget anything.<br>  4. Make sure your horse is well groomed and you have clean tack for the show.<br>  5. Throughout the show, it is important to "check" your position. Make sure you look good, and that your horse does as well.<br>  6. Breath!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

6KxBqnstaa	If this just happend she could have a very bad head trauma and may be ok with time. Best advice is to take to avian vet asap and get her looked at. Until then put a heating pad under the bottom of her cage and cover cage with a blanket half way. Put in dim room and let her rest. Often times within 4-6 hours they will be ok. She does not look good though I have to say. Please take to vet can always get money for another bike but if this is a loved pet getting another one of her is not a option. And if she is terminally injured do the kind thing and get her put to sleep. I know it is hard but have to do what is best for your bird. So sorry.  Also offer her some food and water. She may be in shock.|`|5zaHlQtzaa	I am sorry about your birdie, She looks to be really uncomfortable. I would get her to a VET asap. Just in case she is in any pain.

K8t1lPXsaa	getting him fixed right now might calm the urge to hump things but not necessarily. humping comes from the male hormone which is why they tell you it's best to get them fixed before they're a year so the testosterone hasn't made them reach sexual maturity. <br>  <br>  neutering after sexual maturity may or may not help, it depends on the dog. as for the peeing, many yorkies are stubborn about that but at 6 yrs he should have been well broken out of it. i would suggest going to see an obedience trainer to help you|`|HA00AnmWaa	Even when their fixed they still have the urge to hump.

That being said, you should stick with an insect and veggie diet. I've tried the pellets with mine, but he did not like them at all. Even if yours will happen to eat the pellets, it's not good to be the only food. It still needs the protein from insects as well as the hydration and other nutrients in the veggies (and fruits). Dragon pellets do not provide all the nutrients, but it will cover most. So you can use it along with the other needed foods. It's really a choice that's up to you.<br>  <br>  So, in my opinion, I would forget the pellets. Actually, I still use my pellets, but I don't use them with my dragon... the crickets that I feed my dragon love them, so I use the pellets as part of the gut-loading process. Your dragon should be getting a mixed insect diet of (but not limited to) crickets, cockroaches, wax worms, butter worms, silk worms, etc. Never feed mealworms or pinkie mice as they are huge threats to the health of your dragon. Veggies/Fruit include (again, not limited to) collared, mustard, and dandelion greens, kale, escarole, oranged-fleshed squashes, strawberries, blueberries, peaches, apples, etc. These foods will provide your dragon with the best natural nutrients available.
zfyOhvnNaa	My best advice would be to look her up online.  She surely has a following.  Perhaps you can find her on Facebook or Myspace (probably not her personal one, but a fansite)  Those sites also will likely have clubs dedicated to her you could join.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, if you look up her history and found what college she went to, you might be able to call there to see if she ever does speeches, seminars, things like that.<br>  <br>  Meeting famous people/you idols is hard these days what with stalker rampant -_- Best of luck!<br>  <br>  Here is a facebook one<br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jockeys/50283435162" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Jockeys/50...</a>|`|1OBjkX9vaa	watch jockeys lol|`|9ycJ261daa	here ya go a whole page search till you cant search no more<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Chantal+Sutherland+how+can+I+learn+more+about+her%3F&btnG=Google+Search&aq=f&oq=" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=Cha...</a>|`|5nSVdasNaa	She is featured on the Animal Planet show "Jockeys"....but I am sure that you know that as she is your hero.  <br>  <br>  I would just plug her name into different search engines and see what turns up.<br>  <br>  With a show on television, there is bound to be hundreds of good sites.
vbEkYH2haa	I have 8 tiels, 6 live in an aviary and 2 live inside. <br>  <br>  My two inside tiels live in the same cage, but are so tame that they only have eyes for me and will fight with each other.<br>  <br>  Male cockatiels can be very noisy, you may prefer females. <br>  <br>  The key is to get the birds to bond with you before they bond to each other|`|tqUQclm4aa	hi im sierra smith and i have 3 cockatiells i 1 cage there names are tago-pareis-gacey they love each other and im sure your birds will love you toooooooooooo dont worry about them they will be fine thank you very much!|`|IxuMTGd4aa	I have twenty eight cockatiels (I am a breeder) and my BREEDING pairs are mean, but that's a good trait in birds to defend their off spring.<br>  <br>  But, I do have PET cockatiels, some are caged together, and not all of them are mean. Depends on the bird and how much you love it and play with it.
UJ4heej6aa	Usually, the minimum cage size for a cockatiel is 18" across, by 18" wide, by 24" high. But as with any bird, the bigger the cage the better. He should have plenty of room for plenty of toys, food, water, and a little space left over for flying around. Birds are made to fly, so they're always happier when they have more space to do so. However, if you find that you cannot afford a large flight cage, just make sure that he has plenty of time outside his cage to stretch his wings. If you get two birds, I suggest a cage no smaller than twice that size. BOTH of the birds must have enough room to move around and fly. Keep in mind that the birds cage is where he/she will spend most of his/her life. Spending a little extra money on your birds home will keep him/her happy and healthy for a long time. Don't skimp on your bird's home...they're living creatures with a need for entertainment, companionship, and plenty of living space. If you have any more questions, I suggest you check out some of the links below :) I put a few FAQ pages about cockatiels, as well as a few cages I suggest.|`|K0tpQoHRaa	cage size really is a biggy just be sure that both cox fit and have room to get around and every thing should be jsut fine. you might have to just keep an eye out on the two at first to be sure that they get to know each other at first,,,but the should be fine,DONT WORRY!!!!<br>  good luck!|`|tqUQclm4aa	hi im sierra smith and im 10years old i have 3 cockatiels all in 1 cage! i went to pet smart to get a cage. if you think a little BIT try to think how big your birds are?look at cages try to fit your birds in that cage not for real butt just try . if you think all your bids would fit in the cage then get the cage if you don't think they will all fit then look at other cages. i hope it gos well. i hope you pick me thank you very much!
8i90ov0Gaa	I have probably used over a hundred bags of cypress mulch, all bought for $2 from Home Depot, and never had any bugs in it, although I still spray it and with Provent-a-mite as a preventative. On the other hand, I have known several people who have gotten mites in bags of aspen bought at pet stores. Eco-earth is just another overpriced pet store product and isn't worth the money. In my opinion, cypress mulch is the best bargain and is great for humidity, and aspen is fine as well. You won't have any mold problems if you regularly change it. I've never seen mold in cypress mulch.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Any one of these substrates can grow mold if they are kept too wet. I use fir bark that has been heat treated to remove parasites. I use Repti-bark by Zoo-Med during the warmer parts of the year. In the winter, when the air in your home becomes dry from the heater, I add a little Eco-Earth to the Repti-bark in to enhance the humidifying properties. Cypress bed is a pretty good floor. T-Rex makes a decent one. I feel aspen does better with heavier snakes. It cushions their underside and will not scratch or irritate a heavy snake's belly scales. Depending on what species of snake you plan to keep ( tropical, desert, forest edge, savannah, closed forest etc..) has a lot to do with the type of substrate you will need. The 3 substrates you mentioned are all exceptable for most snakes. A rosy boa, for example, would not thrive well in Eco-Earth. As long as you keep your snake's enclosure clean regularly and not water logged, I recommend repti-bark, fir bark, orchid bark, aspen and cypress bed (not blend) for most snakes.|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	Aspen bedding will only mold if you are not cleaning out your tank every two weeks<br>  I use aspen bedding and my snake loves it<br>  he always plays in it<br>  The other two you are correct on what you have heard, i would not recommend<br>  but if you do get aspen bedding you can go about 3 months before it molds<br>  but you should be cleaning your tank every two to three weeks so that shouldnt happen<br>  i hope this helped|`|jTeDpBjlaa	A decent alternative that I found at Petco is a substrate made from recycled paper. It kind of feels like those gray paper towels except been formulated to be substrate-like (lack of better description) and it's packed in small bales. It's also pretty cheap AND you can flush it (a scoop at a time). I've added the link in the "Source box." My hognoses, corns, and ratsnakes love to burrow in it.<br>  <br>  We also use regular newspaper, especially as a liner.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm allergic to aspen. I've never used cypress nor eco earth.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped!|`|O1VcREmJaa	All of those beddings can grow mold. Depending on the snake will depend on which substrate is best. Eco earth is better for tropical, where aspen is what I'd sugest for no tropical such as a python. Aspen in my oppinion smells more fowl when itgets wet than any substrate I have ever used. This includes when water from the water dishes spills onto it. We use all of these beddings at my job. Eco earth is my favorite|`|HyWeOyT4aa	I have kept snakes for many years, and IMO the best bedding is newspaper, and it's very cost effective. Nearly all breeders/experts agree that newspaper is the safest, and best all around thing to use. Not very attractive but it works very well.
EJpiaCMQaa	Light blue most likely means you have a female.  Males will have only bright blue ceres.  I once had a female who I thought was a male when I bought her years ago, just because she had some blue on her cere.  I was wrong, and he turned out to be a she.  She had a light blue cere just like yours.  I thought it would get darker in color, but it didn't.  I always thought ANY blue color, meant boy, but that's not true.  Adult females will have a pale or whitish-blue, tan, or brown cere.  Female baby budgies have opaque white ceres, with a bluish tint.  Male babies have translucent pink ceres, with a purplish tint.<br>  <br>  You can get the budgie's wings clipped at a petstore or at a vet.  A clipping can run from around $5.00-10.00 depending on what area you live in and if your vet is a specialist.  <br>  <br>  Give your budgie about a week to get used to its new surroundings.  It should start chirping within a few days.  It will take at least a week or a little longer for it to get used to its new home.<br>  <br>  Any kind of music your budgie enjoys is fine.  Some budgies like loud, energetic music, while others like calm, soothing music.  Play whatever kind of music it likes.  Some budgies also like to hear birds singing.  I've sometimes played a "singing birds" tape for my budgies.  <br>  <br>  On taming, first build a bond with your bird and then start taming.  Don't rush into it, or the budgie will be scared and nervous.  Start by finger taming, then tame it out of the cage.  Start talking to it and putting your finger near its tummy for it to step up.  Make sure there are no distractions.  You may need to offer the bird some of its favorite treat to get him on your finger.  Once he's comfortable with your finger, you can try taking him out of the cage.  I recommend getting the budgie's wings clipped so its easier to tame.  Also, there is much less chance of the budgie getting injured by flying into something.  Wing clipping makes them easier to catch, too.<br>  <br>  Here are some links for more information:<br>  <a href="http://www.budgies.org/info/taming.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgies.org/info/taming.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.budgietalk.com/taming.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgietalk.com/taming.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.budgieplace.com/basic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgieplace.com/basic.html</a><br>  <a href="http://birds.about.com/od/breedsofbirds/p/budgerigars.htm" rel="nofollow">http://birds.about.com/od/breedsofbirds/...</a>|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	He is a boy since the cere is light blue. You do not have to go to a vet to get the wings clipped. A local pet store will do it for $5-$10. Vet will charge a visiting fee and that might go up to $50. Skyler is perfect name. Budgies do not "sing" just like that. He needs to get used to you first and be happy first. <br>  <br>  Music is great but buy a playpen and let the bird hang outside. Birds NEED wings! They need to fly around and be happy. Do not clip the wings. Make sure all windows and doors are locked and let the bird play around. That way he will be happy and might chirp and be comfortable quicker.<br>  <br>  For training/taming follow these instructions and get millet as a treat:<a href="http://www.lisashea.com/petinfo/articles/bird_hand.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lisashea.com/petinfo/articles...</a><br>  They are step by step instructions from the basic to eventually hanging out with your bird.|`|MR4LFMY0aa	wow you have a lot of questions! but its good to wnat to know everything.<br>  ok first if you just got your budgie itll be like a week before he'scomfortable maybe a little longer. if his cere is blue itsprobally a boy however you never know for sure. dont jingle the toy yet let him explore on his own. most vets charge 15 to 20 dollars to clip wings. and to cut nails and trim beaks. classical music orflute music is my birdies favs. of course sophie likes rock but shes the odd one! they dispise my trumpet!!! of course i dont like it either! ya but dont put ur hand in the cage just yet. sit by the cage and talk to hime softly. itll take like a week for hime to warm uptoyou and the new place, hope that help!<br>  <br>  the pic would help! ya good luck with your bird, after you train him youmight wanna get hima friend, or else their lonly. my birds wouldnt know what to do w/out the rest of the flock!<br>  <br>  sklars agood name! he's defintly young if the rings are up to his eyes, mine were 6 months when the rings were up to their eyes!<br>  lookup lisa shea parakeet<br>  on google, its an awesome website!!!
OrvTG44laa	Hamsters are solitary animals, meaning they prefer to live alone.  Although pet stores will sometimes keep them together, it is not suggested.  They don't want a 'friend' or a 'buddy' to keep them company.  They like to be alone.  This is a thing to consider before buying one.  You may want a more social animal instead.<br>  <br>       There are many fancy and complicated hamster cages out there.  They usually consist of long tubes and small ladders.  Though they are more entertaining for the both of you, they do have disadvantages.  One is that they are a lot harder to clean.  They have all these different parts so it can be very annoying.  Another is that hamsters may get stuck in the tubes.  This could cause your hamster to die, so it is a thing to seriously consider.  Glass aquariums are a lot easier to clean.  They are suggested because of this and for safety reasons as well.  The very minimum of a cage for a Syrian hamster should be 40 cm wide, 80 cm long and 40 cm tall, but bigger is better.  For other hamsters, you can go a little bit smaller.  Keep the cage out of direct sunlight.  It should be in an area where the temperature is between 65 and 80 degrees.  A good bedding would be alfalfa.  Pine and cedar is toxic, so don't use it.  A small hiding hut is good to put in to, since hamsters like to hide.  A wheel is also a good idea.  However, since hamsters are nocturnal, they will usually be running on the wheel at night.  The ones that squeak are bound to keep you up, so the silent ones are heavily suggested.  It should have a solid surface, to avoid your hamster's feet getting caught in between the rungs.  The cage should be cleaned every week.<br>  <br>       Water should be provided in a water bottle.  Hamsters are omnivorous, meaning they eat plant and meat.  In the wild, they'd eat grains, seeds, plants and insects.  However, pet hamsters should not be fed insects as they wouldn't react normally to it.  Food should be put in a small dish to keep the cage cleaner.  A good type of diet is a mixed diet made for hamsters.  The food should be changed daily.  They also need something to gnaw on.  Hamster's teeth will constantly grow.  If they don't have something to keep the growing down, thier teeth can go through the roof of thier mouth|`|7AI58IS8aa	Hamsters are tiny, nocturnal rodents covered from head to toe with different colours of fur. They are great pets to keep in a cage and are easy to take care of. If you would like to tame your hamster the best time to do so is when he is still young. The older he gets the harder it will be to make him trust people. Start by talking to your hamster and do not pick him up until you are sure he isn’t frightened of you. Hamsters will bite when they are frightened so be careful. If he shows any signs of being stressed, leave and try stroking him after a while. Cup your hands gently around the hamster to pick him up, or pick him up at the scruff of the neck, the way the mother hamsters will carry her babies when they are still young. It will take about three to four weeks to tame a hamster so be patient. Hamsters need a cage, food, water, a hiding place, toys and soft bedding materials. <br>  <br>  <br>  For the cage, make sure it is not made of wood. The hamster would just eat his way through the cage, escape and might hurt himself. Never keep the cage near heaters, direct sunlight, on a fridge, next to a television or a radio. All these will harm the hamster and will cut his life expectancy down very much. Get the largest cage you can afford since the larger the cage is, the happier the hamster will be. Another great way to keep your hamster is in a glass tank. The hamster will not be able to gnaw his way out, and will not feel as cornered as the metal “prisons”. Ventilation is provided from the top, and a tray can be used at the bottom to ease the cleaning. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Hamsters will eat a variety of food such as apples, nuts, chicken, rice, eggs, hamster food, eggs, pasta, and bananas. Make sure you avoid any citrus fruits since they will be harmful to the hamsters. Make sure the hamster has a healthy diet with some fresh vegetables and fruit on every day. Store the store-bought hamster food in airtight containers in a dry dark place to ensure it stays fresh. <br>  <br>  <br>  Fresh water should always be supplied to the hamster. The easiest way to do this is by getting a water bottle especially designed for hamsters. You can also use a bowl with fresh water, but make sure it is a heavy bowl so the hamster can’t tip it over and so you don’t have to refill the water as often. If the bowl tips over the bedding will also get wet and you will have to clean out the cage. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hiding places are also important to the hamster. They love to hide under a log or inside a cardboard box. They will chew on the cardboard so something out of wood will be better. Don’t take the hamster out of the hiding place since he will feel safe to sleep in there and he needs a place of privacy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hamsters like to play with at least one toy and a great one to get is a wheel. The metal ones will last much longer since he will probably bite it once in a while. Keep it oiled to ensure that it will not squeak and keep you up at night. Hamsters love getting a new toy, so instead of having many toys crammed into the cage, periodically give him a different one to play with. Keep the wheel inside the cage at all times though since it will help the hamster exercise. Good ideas for hamster toys are underground tunnels (such as a toilet paper roll on the bedding), swings, bridges, tubes, and mirrors. <br>  <br>  <br>  The bedding material should be plain pine wood shavings, or saw dust or straw. Do not buy any scented materials since the hamster might develop an allergic reaction to those materials. Give the hamster at least 2 inches of the bedding to make sure he is comfortable. For nesting materials give the hamster paper flakes or shredded paper, but make sure it isn’t newsprint since that will contain harmful chemicals to the hamster. Paper is inexpensive and safe for the hamster. <br>  <br>  <br>  Something to look out for is that the hamster doesn’t get temperature that is lower then 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If this happens, the hamster will start entering hibernation and the hamster may appear to be dead. Hibernation can last from just a few minutes to an entire week. Usually the hibernation will last about two or three days and the hamster will probably get up to feed about once every twelve hours. Hamsters have been mistaken for dead since their body temperature will drop a few degrees, their heart will only beat about 4 times per minute and they will have less then one breath per minute. So if you are in doubt whether your hamster is in hibernation or dead, make sure you bring him to the local pet store and don’t bury him by accident. If he is in hibernation keep fresh food near him for the time he feeds, and slowly increase the temperature back to normal to help him come out of the hibernation. Do not do this too quickly though because he might go into metabolic stress and they might die. The best way to ensure your hamster is well and happy is to keep him at room temperature.|`|TUFoB5RMaa	Providing it with all the basic things <a href="http://www.hamster-club.com/housing_cage.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamster-club.com/housing_cage...</a><br>  <br>  And providing lots of play, love and caring :) hamsters will know when it's owner cares for them.

Yr4eBnXlaa	This is the second time you've asked the same question.  The answer is still, YES, they are hard to breed.  Their needs are not easy to meet, and not just anyone (not even fully experienced breeders) can get them to mate and successfully produce enough babies to pay for all the expenses and time involved.
taLD45Sqaa	The kind of dog you like is not really suited to living in an apartment. Huskies need lots of room to run and I bet Germans Shepherds do too. Maybe you could get something else for the time being or wait until your situation is better suited to the kind of dog you want. I waited forever to buy my first house so I could get dogs! It's so much better knowing your doggies are truly happy. Maybe someone has some smaller dog suggestions for you that wouldn't be so bad? Poms are part of the Spitz line, which basically makes them mini sled dogs :)
9kceDOTraa	I would have to agree that South Americans like the ones you have listed, would not work very well with a Front.  Fronts are from lake Tangyangika and the water in Tangyangika is VERY hard and high in pH, much higher then any of the other rift lakes.  The difference is close to 2 complete pH points which is 20 times more alkaline then typical South American waters.  That aspect alone would make it very difficult to try to mix South Americans with any Tangyangikan.<br>  <br>  Green Terrors and Jack Dempseys are also rule the whole tank type of South Americans as well.  Just to keep the stock you have now, if they are in anything under 150 gallons, that's playing with a ticking time bomb, it's just a matter of time.  Throw in a pair of Oscars, and just to house that size of fish total, you're talking over 200 gallons easily.  I don't see this idea working out very well.|`|H06PtiIAaa	no, frontosas are african cichlids and like seperate tanks with higher phs.<br>  <br>  oscars GT and dempsey are also way to aggressive for frontosas.|`|oMINgkuiaa	no, the frontosa is an african cichlid and should be kept with others. also it is way to timid to be with something like a oscar or a green terror.
44kEtDvIaa	Do it the way you'd introduce a cat, or another dog.  If you're concerned, keep your dog on a leash so you can control the situation.  Normally they will get along, but depending on the age of your dog, it may take a little while.  Be patient with them.  Let the dog come around the cage where your ferrets live so he gets used to seeing and smelling them.  Ferrets adapt well.|`|EuX56kmraa	i know someone who's ferret runs around with the pit bulls and hes fine! u just have to introduce it like any other animal.
aeonmRR2aa	That's not generally useful, but it could be in some cases.<br>  <br>  The mid-level intake will just suck in mid-level water in addition to bottom-level water.  Normally the detritus (poop, plant leaves, fish scales, etc) floats around closer to the bottom when it is disturbed, so a low-level intake will get more of it.  But if your flow circulates such that you see lots of stuff floating around at the mid level instead of at the bottom, you could open that port.<br>  <br>  There are a couple additional cases.  First, if there are algae wafers or small bottom-dwelling crustaceans that keep getting sucked into the filter, opening the middle port would help by reducing suction at the bottom.  Second, the Bernoulli effect and short path may slightly increase total flow with that hole open.  However, when doing a partial water change, the mid-level port will cause you to lose suction when the water drops to that level, so keep it closed at that time unless you shut the filter off.<br>  <br>  Overall...  one of the better marketing gimmicks, but still a gimmick - one more part that can fail or cause problems.|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	The flow of water should be roughly the same volume the velocity at the intake(s) will change.
juyA6HUJaa	If you're after a guinea pig you should always buy 2, they're herd animals and get very lonely when theres only one. Fleece (although can get smelly) or carefresh (which doesn't smell AT ALL!) is a good bedding don't use sawdust it can cause infections (URI's) etc, they need unlimited hay and water, 1 cup of veg per pig and about 1/8th of a cup of pellets everyday. Don't feed the mixed food with nuts seeds or colours.. they could choke and arn't good for piggies. They should be kept in very big cages.. especially boys to stop fighting. Pet shop cages arn't good enough for even a baby guinea pig, look at guineapigcages.com for good ones :) with recomended sizes etc. they should be kept inside, have a lot of time to play etc, NEVER put one in a ball or wheel it can make them disabled, don't feed them salt licks or pet shop treats they're also very bad for them.

Or, if he's an older piggie, it could possibly be molar issues. Young piggies don't usually have dental issues.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Is it more like a "wheek" (squeal) or "whoople" sound?

It must  be kept in a safe place where it can not harm others.  There must be a comfortable habitat for the alligator.  There are regulations, but most likely no one will come to your house and check to see if your up to code.  Use your common sense and make sure no one gets hurt.  Oh and another thing, no homosexual alligators.  That would be a federal offense.  All homosexual alligators must be executed on sight.   Get a male and female and make sure it is not homosexual alligator.  If its an albino alligator you will know right away that it is a homosexual.|`|0H0HVuwvaa	ummm. why do you wana alligator and look at this it might help you change your mind (CRAZY)O_ no offense|`|JfsN4FSraa	well im not sure if you google it you probably will get your answer! hope this helps!|`|nSIMwm9zaa	im not positive i think you have 2 have a lisence for it
UFn9eMYvaa	-feed her what she usually eats. make sure she never runs out of food. also give her diced carrots and pieces of hard boiled eggs, this will give her the protein she needs (without the extra protein, she could eat her babies!)<br>  -if she doesn't have a little igloo or a house, give her one now. give her extra bedding (preferably a paper-based bedding, like carefresh)<br>  -anywhere from 16-23<br>  - her regular cage is fine. if you are keeping the babies, get another cage for when the boys need to be separated in a few weeks.<br>  -her regular bedding plus an extra handful. <br>  <br>  -remove the male hamster soon after they're done breeding! she might be temperamental while she's pregnant. also, don't touch the babies or change the bedding after they are born, until they are about 3 weeks old. if your hamster mommy is too stressed out or needs the nutrition, she will eat her babies, and that's never fun!|`|JNnSMh64aa	1. What to feed her?<br>  Make sure your hamster has plenty of food to eat. She needs all of the food she can get. Give her healthy food like lab blocks, green vegetables, and colored vegetables. I would also give her whole wheat grains so she gains weight during the pregnancy. Also, make sure she has plenty of water.<br>  2. Let her make a nest out of soft material, and keep it as natural as possible. I would not give her tissue or cotton, for these could strangle the baby. I would use peat moss, play sand, or soft litter.<br>  3. Hamsters gestation periods, I think, last around 2 or 3 months<br>  4. Her cage should be a 15 gallon aquarium. Do not get a wired cage because the babies could easily escape or get their heads stuck in the wires.<br>  5. Make sure there is plenty of bedding for her to feel comfortable in. I'd say about 3 or 4 inches.<br>  6. Make sure her pregnancy and birthing are normal, if anything goes wrong, immediately call a vet.
rdcxVqfxaa	Well first of all, Rocky may not be a he, but rather a she. Your bird may be trying to nest, and her food bowl just seemed to be the most appropriate place to do so. She may be ready to lay an egg, or she may just be trying to get comfortable. I suggest purchasing a nesting box and placing it in a corner in her cage and letting her nest there instead. If she does lay an egg, it would be best not to bother it, as you wouldn't want to cause harm to the baby bird. Good luck. :)|`|lMSAyTm6aa	maybe rocky is nesting? my canary did that right before she decided to tear up her cage papers and build a nest in her food bowl. There are three babies in there now :)|`|K0tpQoHRaa	firt off he might be a she,and if other birds they could be its mate.most likely trying to push out an egg in a place it feels is suitable for nesting.get a nesting box for it and see if it goes in and tries to lay.she would be in there most of the time thats how yould know.<br>  <br>  BEST ANSWER!!!|`|7MzldDHYaa	If it is the water bowl,then he is just bathing.If he is in the food bowl,then he might be nesting or thinks the spot is cozy,like my bird!

wLgGD63raa	Here is a slurry recipe from Marcia at GoldenGateGeckos.com. This recipe is for emergency situations only and is not meant to supplement your gecko's regular diet. Once he is back on his feet you need to switch back to a regular diet.<br>  <br>  In a blender, combine:<br>  1 small can Hill's A/D pet food (available at most vets)<br>  1/4-1/3 cup Ensure (not chocolate)<br>  1 jar baby food squash<br>  1/4-1/3 cup Pedialite<br>  2 tablets or contents of 2 capsules milk thistle (herbal supplement, liver purifier, found at most drug stores.)<br>  1/2 tsp. each calcium powder and herp vitamin powder<br>  1 large handful of mealworms, added slowly while mixture is blending<br>  <br>  Puree all ingredients until completely smooth, and pour into ice cube tray(s) and freeze. Store cubes in zip-lock bag in the freezer until ready to use, then thaw out 1 cube at a time and store in fridge for 2-3 days. I use the empty baby food jar for this purpose, washing it thoroughly after each batch.<br>  <br>  Using this mixture, draw a full dropper (eye dropper type) and place a drop on the gecko's nose. It will lick it off, and as it does, slowly squeeze out a little at a time. Most geckos love this food, and will lap it up.<br>  <br>  If he does not start to do better in the next couple of days you may want to consider taking him to the vet.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, to the person who said mealworms are bad for Leo's, sorry to break it to you but you've been misinformed. Crickets would be more harmful to a Leo than anything, because they can bite your gecko. As soon as a gecko eats the mealworm, it is kind of dead, if it's not dead by the time they swallow it, the stomach acid would kill it. All it is is a silly urban legend.|`|ENVJAX6caa	mealworms are actually bad for the leopard gecko because they can actually eat through its stomach. Personally you should just leave him be and throw in a few crickets, most likely its about to shed and if not it still has a lot of fat stored in its tail so it should be good for a few days. If he still doent eat after a few days go to your vet and get him looked at.|`|l0ktQUnWaa	Yes, you can force feed a lizard. Is it a good idea? Only if absolutely necessary. Is it fun? No.<br>  Force feeding is a temporary solution. It can prolong life, it can also prolong suffering. You have to find out why he isn't eating. You need a vet for this. I have included a link that explains force feeding. Get the Gecko to a vet, a rescue, or the humane society.<br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/emaciation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/emaciation.html</a>|`|1vgseyCqaa	Dear tkoolpal,<br>  As I believe you are aware, I am a very hip and contemporary man when it comes to all things important, and all things to me are important.<br>  Back to the leopard gecko...<br>  The main thing in considering what to feed Mr. gecko is global warming.<br>  Al Gore is very clear about what foods geckos eat leaving the least carbon foot print.  Al Gore prefers that you would get a lizard instead because lizards have tiny toes and not the large carbon feet and toes of the leopard gecko.<br>  But, it is too late for that so...<br>  back to the gecko...<br>  It you consider the need for all of us to pull together and save the globe then Big Al, (that what I like to call him), Big Al suggests feeding him recycled toilet paper dipped in a very light mixture of toilet water and carbon free cow urine.  They seem to love that especially if it is followed by 1/2 oz of cheap brandy.  Big Al is known to give hard liquor to all his pets on the farm where he grew up.  Somewhere in  upper Manhattan I believe.  Call me if this doesn't do the trick and I'll give Big Al a call for you.|`|XF1ctbrkaa	best idea is to monitor crickets.. (try disabling the crickets or holding them in tongs to feed.. sometimes they don't eat because they can't quite catch them)..  <br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, find a vet that deals with reptiles.. have a basic exam done, they will probably give you some science diet A/D food to force feed.. (this is easier than it sounds.. you use a "syringe" and hold the body in your closed palm, hold head between your fingers and just nudge the side of the mouth.. (slipping one side of the tip under the ridge) ..it will open its mouth..
b70c76c680f23b7b2d94815940d49450aa	Chickens aren't supposed to eat chicken meat as they're largely vegetarian (worms and grubs don't count). Just like cows aren't supposed to eat beef and pigs aren't supposed to eat pork etc.<br>  <br>  Chickens will eat pretty much anything even things which are poisonous so your chooks may have wanted more but it doesn't necessarily mean it's OK for them!<br>  <br>  My advice is to keep them on a diet which offers them good quality nutrition.|`|AA11569882	Chickens will want anything, just as long as you don't feed them the brain they'll be alright (I don't know why you might want to give her the brain, but hey, just don't!).<br>  <br>  Do you think it might be time to put them outside?  They'll be happier there, and so will you - you must spend hours cleaning the floor!

EJpiaCMQaa	People once thought that a duck's quack had some special kind of sonic quality that made it not echo.  However, a duck's quack DOES echo.  A duck's echo just isn't that noticeable.  Research was done at the University of Salford at Manchester in 2003 that proved that a duck's quack does echo.<br>  <br>  Here's the link to that research:<br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/duckecho.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/duck...</a>|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Sure it does...doesn't it?|`|SoUDkOejaa	hmm.. i've never heard that before? who told you that
YnCUyvK7aa	I would doubt that you could use powder, the particles would be so small, they'd go right through you floss or foam or whatever you were using to hold them and make your water look dirty.  You have to have a way to contain the charcoal so that the water flows through it.<br>  <br>  And I don't know how you would make the powder into pellets.  If you were to use any kind of glue or binder, you'd be blocking water from getting to that part of the charcoal, so it wouldn't be as effective in removing anything from the water in your tank.<br>  <br>  You could glue it to something, like gravel or an ornament, but charcoal only absorbs so much, then it can release what's bound to it back into your water.  So you'd have to replace whatever you glued it to each month.<br>  <br>  While it might sound like a good idea and a way to use the powder and not have to buy this for your tank, it really isn't very practical to do.<br>  <br>  And most aquarists don't use carbon/charcoal in their tanks all the time, only when they need to remove medication, or have driftwood that's discoloring their water.<br>  <br>  ADDED  Actually I was thinking of aquarium grade silicone, gel cyanoacrylate [super glue], or marine epoxy would be used as the glue.  All are aquarium safe when dry and cured, and some kinds can be used in the water.  But it's still not practical to use them.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Yes you can. <br>  Go to any store and buy small cloth bag. You can find these in hobby shop or make one. If you have the money to spend go to pet store and buy one.<br>  <br>  Then put the charcoal in and close it tightly and hang it next to a high water flow area.<br>  <br>  By the way activate means high degree of microporosity. And just that. <br>  <br>  There are many form of activated material sold in the form of fine powder. Once put in the bag and closed tight, they simply cannot escape and pass through the cloth material.<br>  Seachem has many product sold including the bag.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|aeonmRR2aa	No, you can't use charcoal powder; only use well-rinsed granulated or pelletized activated carbon.  Powder will dissipate through the water and hurt the fish.  There is thought to be a connection between hole-in-the-head (HITH), a fish disease, and carbon dust.  But regardless, it will make the water black.<br>  <br>  In general, you only need to use carbon right after medication, or to remove other specific contaminants (such as if you prefilter tap water before adding to the tank).  Some people use it to remove dissolved organics that gradually turn water yellow, but water changes will work for that and remove nitrates, too.<br>  <br>  @Black Kat.  The glue is an interesting suggestion (though impractical, as you noted), but I'd like to comment that most glues would probably saturate the carbon with organic vapors and other chemicals, and coat many of its pores, too :)  Commercial air filters have carbon stages with fine charcoal dust stuck firmly on fibers, but I don't know how it gets stuck there.|`|grJG2c8jaa	You should only use special filter (activated) carbon for your tank to make sure it will absorb all impurities. Not all carbon forms i.e. charcoal powder will be able to do this.<br>  Hope this helps :)

If the surgery is arthroscopic, your vet will be looking through the fiber-optic scope viewer and the rest of your horse will be draped with sterile surgical dressing.  Your vet might or might not let you scrub up and get close enough to watch;  it depends on your vet and his insurance policy (some policies prohibit anyone but necessary surgical personnel in the operating theater).<br>  <br>  Induction of anesthesia would be interesting and you can probably see that.  <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would ask the vet directly how much you will be able to watch, and how close;  and ask the teacher who is giving the test if you can re-schedule, explaining the circumstances.  (If you're a good student and the teacher is reasonable, I would say you have a good chance of having the test re-scheduled.)<br>  <br>  Word to the wise:  some people, even people who very much want to be vets, can find that their first experience with surgery at close range can be a bit unsettling.  If you go and if you for any reason start to feel lightheaded, sit down and get your head down at once.  In one of my high-school ag classes, one of the toughest farm boys in the school went to a vet's to observe surgery.  It was a cat spay, no big deal, but this guy had never seen an animal opened up like that and he fainted.  Fell forward and hit his forehead on a countertop on the way down.  Had to have five stitches of his own.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Just go to school- it won't be as great as you think. All you will see is the before and after, not the procedure itself. They do not have viewing rooms, you know.<br>  <br>  Besides, if you want to be a vet you will eventually see or participate in such a procedure- and really, just seeing one performed when you were 14 will mean nothing to such a career. Concentrate on school- being a vet, large or small animal, is comparable to becoming a doctor, med school and all. Don't get in the habit of throwing school by the wayside for frivolous reasons now.
v4vyq9Thaa	I would separate them to make sure the little one gets enough food. Also leave a dish with mealworms in it so that the gecko can eat even when you're not around. He is probably stressed and shy and will be more likely to eat when you are not around.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|wLgGD63raa	In case you didn't see my answer in your other question:<br>  <br>  You need to separate them. You've already figured out that the bigger one is eating all the food, the worst part is you are allowing it to happen right in front of you. Leopard geckos are solitary creatures by nature and should remain so in captivity. You are not doing them any favors by getting them a friend, companion, mate or whatever you want to call it. Chances are all you are doing is stressing them out. It may seem they're getting along well but you may wake up one morning to an injured or possibly dead gecko. There are too many bad situations that come from housing solitary animals together and it is just not worth it, the best thing for yourself (unless you like wasting money on vet bills) and your leopard geckos is to separate them.|`|0Is8sJj0aa	could be stress I suggest separating them to avoid fights and the stress that is probably going on
V7AAba8Laa	Double yolks are pretty common in younger layers, and usually stop after the bird is about 18 months.  You may still see one every once in awhile.<br>  <br>  Double yolks and "monster eggs" as we call them are simply the result of a still developing reproductive system in a younger hen.  Generally they slow or stop this random occurrence by about a year or a year and a half.  <br>  <br>  Make sure your birds are getting plenty of crushed oyster shell for calcium, which will help ensure that their eggs have strong shells and reduces the risk of a bird becoming eggbound.  Enjoy your birds and your fresh eggs!|`|UtwcSsfpaa	Check out www.FeatherSite.com

Aspen is ok, though.|`|HU2DIscZaa	well mine had the same thing i gave it fresh cold water and it worked|`|7SyCZnM9aa	You can try giving her echinacea and yogurt. This will help boost her immune system. Also treat her with foods high in vitamin c. Try keeping a humidifier about four feet away from her cage and leave it running whenever she is awake and active. Also you can try Rabbit Rx, it's basically vapor rub for small animals. Just take a small drop and rub around the nose. If you see a reddish substance around her nose, it's called pyrothrin. It can be a sign of stress or illness. If it progresses any further, she needs to see a vet immediately as this could be a condition called mycoplasma. This is ultimately deadly for a rat. If it is, then she will need antibiotics the rest of her life. If you simply stopped the antibiotics, the infection can reoccur at any time. The vet will most likely (or should) give you baytril and doxycycline for it.|`|t6jYdWJkaa	take her to the vet, the herbs may mask something more serious. Your rats heath is too important. Good Luck!

Some gets really huge and others do not. <br>  <br>  According to what you said about the white thing, i stongly beleive that she will give birth within a week maybe even sooner depending on how long the white opening was there.<br>  <br>  Please do not move her back and forth from net to tank because that stresses fish alot and she might abort the fry (babies) So just leave her in her breeding thing.<br>  <br>  I took a video of one of my female platy when she was only three days away from giving birth, so take a look:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GrKfuZTSU4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GrKfuZTS...</a><br>  You can't see the white thing but that's how a platy will look like if it's ready to give birth the following 5-7 days.<br>  <br>  If your platy looks like that you need to place her either in a separate tank or in a breeding box called Lee's Multi-Purpose 3-Way Breeders and it looks like this:<a href="http://www.petco.com/product/7449/Lee-s-Multi-Purpose-3-Way-Breeders.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/7449/Lee-s-...</a> and keep her there and do not move her back and forth.<br>  You should place her there as soon as possible and feed her as usual so that she doesn't get stressed out by being bothered my other fish.<br>  <br>  I would strongly recommend that breeding box because platies do eat their fry as soon as they are born, but if you manage to get that breeding box the fry (babies) will be safe from the mothers reach because there's a separator that keeps the babies from mother as soon as they are born, i personally never tried the next i've always used the box so that's up to you....<br>  You should remove the mother from that box as soon as she is finished (she will look really skinny) I usually let mine there for 24 hours after seeing the 1st fry to make sure she really finished but keep a close eye on her so she doesn't try to get to the fry.<br>  <br>  I have a video of my platy (the pregnant one) when she had fry, so that you can see how the fry are kept in that breeding box: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0Uo-a22uU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mM0Uo-a22...</a><br>  Note that it took my platy 28 days after mating to have babies and she has them every month and it's always either a day sooner or later then she had them the previous month.<br>  <br>  You should buy a food for the fry called "first bite" : <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikari-First-Bites.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikar...</a> and feed them it three times a day, for about 3-4 weeks and then you can crush some flakes in a ziplock bag into small pieces and feed them. After about 1 month and a weeks you can move them into another tank (not the same as their parents or other big fish) so that they will have more room to grow....When you notice that they are about half of the size of their parents, you can put them in that tank if you like, but note that they do breed like crazy so i would recommend keeping the male from female once they get big if you don't want more babies, but if you do, just leave them all there....Well i talked about but this is really all you need to know, good luck and don't forget that platies fry need a heater just in-case you don't have one and keep it around 77 degrees Fahrenheit|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	Stop moving her.<br>   That will stress her out and you will loose the fish, she could abort them as well|`|kSyhfGhqaa	I don't think you should put her into the breeding net just yet. She may die because you just got her and you keep shifting her from the main tank to the breeder net. So she might get stressed out, also because the breeder nets are small and she won't have a lot of space. If you have lots of plants and places for the fish to hide then leave her in there. She will probably hide in something and give birth then you can scoop the fry (baby fish) and put them into the breeder net. <br>  Do you have any other fish in the tank? Are there lots of places for the baby fish to hide?
xyPpruSjaa	Of course you will need TONS of toys to prevent your hamster from getting bored :D Make sure you have bedding in your cage too! It's the substrate that goes in the bottom of the cage. I like sunseed freshworld bedding, I wouldn't get aspen though because hamsters can develop skin allergies and it hurts their feet, and it is sometimes very dusty. Care fresh is a nice alternative, but it's pricey. You will also need chew toys. Hamster's teeth continuously grow throughout their life and if they don't have something to chew on, their teeth can get too long and cause them a lot of pain, if this happens call up a vet and see if they can trim them! I seem to notice that hamsters like flavored chew toys, also ones made out of treats/food. They seem to ignore plain wood sticks, talk about picky :O <br>  <br>  Good luck! You're going to be an excellent hamster owner :]<br>  <br>  If anyone needs any help or has any questions on gerbils, hamsters, mice, or rats email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|GMvzUYbSaa	You're doing everything great. They definately need a wheel. And make sure you have chew sticks for them. Like blocks of wood you can buy at petstores. And you can also get a little ball for them to run around. But that isn't needed for life :P And of course, bedding. But you already knew that. Don't get wood chips. Especially cedar. Get aspen or recycled newspaper stuff like carefresh. It comes in a green bag.  MAke sure to play with it lots!|`|Ghp39K4Kaa	Chew toys.  These will help keep the teeth trim and entertain the hamster.  Otherwise, play with the hamster every day and clean the cage every week, and your hamster will live a long and happy life.|`|JNnSMh64aa	Ya I would get chew toys and a food bowl.|`|iasOicRjaa	Something to chew on to control tooth growth...|`|3PzVT6RNaa	Get bedding, the synthetic kind is better than the wood chips because the wood chips normally aggravated their respiratory tract. Also get some chewing stones or wood, otherwise it might start to chew on the cage. There are little edible log houses that the hamster can hide in and chew on. My rats love them.|`|BnCHahruaa	ME, its called wood shavings lol<br>  food<br>  running ball<br>  protection from any bigger animal(dog, cat, etc)|`|HU2DIscZaa	what everyone else said|`|ubC1reIraa	the chipped wood thingys that you put down on the bottom of the cage so they can walk around in
o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  You just need to wait a couple of days. She is getting used to you and where you live. Just whistle to your new budgie. When i got my birds they were so quiet and never talked at all! I whistled to them everyday and then about 5 days later they started to talk. They are so noisy now! I like it though. Good luck!|`|UdHnRULiaa	its prolly nerves. but female birds aren't really vocal. its usually the males attracting mates. not saying she wont chirp, its just not as often as males|`|b3ZLY5osaa	im sure shes just adjusting still|`|CQww1c2daa	She's new to her cage and her house.  She will chirp in a few days.  I have had many birds.
IRqccZQeaa	I had a female parakeet when I was young.  I have pix of her sitting nicely on my hand, on the brim of a hat that I was wearing, on my shoulder, & on a ladder I was holding.  But I also had a male parakeet that I could hold on a ladder.  Probably depends on how much you work with them & your patience.  You gain their trust after perseverance & they are very social to their human pals.  :)  <br>  <br>  The new female that we have now is pretty nice. (I may have a female & a male or two females.) They were pretty hand tame when we bought them (from Petsmart -rare parakeets.)   My boy was able to put his hand in the cage & pull her out while she was sitting on his hand.  The other one also... until I rigged a real branch (from outside) between our pendalent lights.  They sat up on that thing & looked like they were in Budgie Cloud Seven or Cloud Nine :)*.  They were rubbing their heads all over it, nibbling on it, & their feathers around their beaks were puffed up like they were smiling. :)  After that we had the hardest time putting them back into their cage.  Beforehand we could put them nicely on our hand & talk to them, put them on the carpet to run around, etc.  Now since they've had a taste of feeling like they're up in a real tree, they want nothing else to do with us or cooperating with anything.  At least for now.  ~like taking a favorite bone from a dog.  Long story short... I think they are both equally tameable.  ~Depends on the bird & circumstances.  :)|`|1omgPICKaa	Often, males are considered to be easier to tame. However, both genders can make very loving, tame pets.<br>  Make sure you buy a hand raised budgie if you want it to be tame.|`|MqoAtxZYaa	Hi,<br>   I would say male as hens will become aggressive when they become mature and want to breed.|`|yet0QXKQaa	Males are always easier to train, regardless of the type of pet.|`|Qas05nZraa	males|`|CtwGOAykaa	Males are more content than the females seem to be.
r2kfmiq3aa	PRECIOUS.|`|djACi5Braa	I think either rainbow or skittles.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Zelda<br>  <br>  Bonnie Blue<br>  <br>  I liked the suggestion of Rainbow. That's very cute for a multi colored bird.. Aurora would work too.|`|1e1eUHr3aa	is it a girl or boy?<br>              Girl                                       Boy<br>       Lala                                          Greenie<br>       Rainbow                                    Rainbow<br>       Blu blue                                     Blue<br>       Greenie
VXZLYJzSaa	The tank doesn't look overstocked, but when the Angels, Pictus and Goldfish grow then if they can catch the danios they'll become a snack, my monies on the pictus getting them first one night...<br>  <br>  Salt will do an Angelfish no good unless you have a high amount of Nitrite in your water, and then only because it detoxifies the Nitrite and reduces the chance of it causing a type of anaemia which effects fish which are poisoned by Nitrite.<br>  <br>  Angelfish are Amazonian fish and prefer soft acidic water, something impossible to accomplish by adding salt of any sort. You should check your tank's water is fine because you lost a fish recently. Make sure Ammonia and Nitrite read at 0ppm or mg/l, Nitrate is 50-100mg/l as an absolute max, but the lower the better and pH is about 6.5-7.5, though I'd aim for 7.5 if your keeping danios and goldfish.<br>  <br>  Preserve the fish corpse by drying it off on paper towel, then freezing it in a sandwich bag or similar in your food freezer.|`|AA11151670	Put the fish in the freezer, when ready to return, rap in newspaper. Angle fish need lots of room to grow, they can get over 7 inches. They are also aggressive and Territorial. When putting fish in your tank, lower then into the tank in a bag of water for a half hour, then open the bag and release them. If you wont to have fish that stay healthy, read some books on them or do a search on computer about each type.|`|XF1ctbrkaa	well, Angels are fairly hard to keep to begin with..  they thrive in more brackish water.. (saltier than freshwater, but not as salty as salt water)  <br>  .. <br>  <br>  You already know that the goldfish is a problem.. but the fact is, goldfish are the biggest waste producers..  get a water test done .. (I believe petco requires a water sample for a return anyway)  Look at the ammonia levels.. if they are high, you will most likely have to find somewhere else for the goldfish... or syphon the gravel and change the filter at LEAST once a week to help keep it clean. .. Honestly, Angels being a bit more aggressive I'd never put them with danios anyway..|`|OblSdMaaaa	put the dead fish in  your freezer (in a sandwich bag). <br>  <br>  Your tank isn't overstocked, but I would get rid of the goldfish.|`|dXLMDGqDaa	you need at least 100 gallon tank your tank is ove stock|`|BwiJpmYQaa	No your tank is not over stocked. I don't know what kind of system for filtration you have but Angels are VERY sensitive to Ph levels and other chemicals. It's VERY hard to keep them. And with a goldfish it's even worse. I love Oranda's so don't get me wrong. Just Goldies are dirty fish. Need a very good filtration system. <br>  <br>  I don't know who told you cats eat danios because I have a tank with JUST Dainos, pictus, and black fin shark cats. They're bottom feeders that only eat bottom feeder food.  I've never heard of Pictus eating Danios or any other fish for that matter.<br>  <br>  You have a TON of room left. I would say that if you want to get angels to move your Oranda to it's own tank like a 20 gal or something. This is because of amonia levels have to be Zero like you say and the P.h. needs to be alkaline for Angels like 6.0 They are acidic fish. <br>  <br>  I think you have a very nice set up. I'd go so far as to add some more fish like the black fin cat sharks, tin foil barbs, silver dollars, or Hatchet fish. You have a nice tank.<br>  <br>  Angels are hard to keep, don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Oh and from experience... I hate Petco fish too.
UFn9eMYvaa	Yup, the gestation will take 16-23 days. Sometimes it will be a few days early or late, though. <br>  <br>  Mostly, you just want to leave her alone. Don't pick her up much, it can damage the babies and also she will be more temperamental than usual. Make sure she always has plenty of food and  water, as well as extra bedding and an igloo/house. After the babies are born, try not to touch them or change the cage until they've opened their eyes.|`|3fGZMZkTaa	16 days|`|wq5elE1zaa	Well it kind of depends on when she got pregnant. Otherwise a normal hamster's gestation period is 16-23 days. Gestation lasts 16 to 18 days for Syrian hamsters, 18 to 21 days for the Russian hamsters, 21 to 23 days for Chinese hamsters and 23 to 30 for Roborovski Hamsters.

ggilREqfaa	Well it depends I am a dog person. <br>  What do you want from a pet?<br>  I think that if you want an inside thing that cuddles and stuff then get a cat.<br>  But if you are getting a dog you should get a medium to large breed.<br>  I like Alaskan Malamutes, but if the hair is a problem then I would get a lab, german Shepperd, or a blue healer.|`|TblG3s89aa	i like both but which one you get depends on your lifestyle for example if you want more of a solitary pet you should get a cat but if you want a more social pet you should get a dog. Which one you get also depends on your level of activity because you usually don't walk a cat but you should walk a dog (more or less depending on the breed).Also if you have friends overaltot and youwantn a pet to greet them when they come or if you want a pet who will always wait for you to get home and greet you at the door you should get a dog and if you want a pet who will do anything for you and if you want to train it to do tricks or to even teach it help you by bringing you a soda or turning off the lights you should get a dog<br>  I PREFER DOGS|`|SZdSFi1raa	I would buy a cat. Mine are great even though they are insane.One of them knows when I am sad and will stay by me till I cheer up at bit. One of my other cats will lay with you when you are sick and become a heating pad, it is great.  I had a dog once she was great so. She was probably the best dog anyone could ever ask for. So I guess its up to you. If you have the time you should get dog but if you don't have a lot or time then I cat will be better. Cats can be a lone longer then a dog can they are more independent.|`|cNYugr5raa	depend on what you need it for. A dog for protection and loyalty, a cat for a cuddly pet.|`|ikTT4GkHaa	I have a cat now<br>  So i think i would want a dog :]<br>  Two to be exact|`|7i8ZKUQZaa	Both well i already have 5 cats so id get a dog|`|XUZ17OOraa	DOG :D<br>  <br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  CAT :D<br>  <br>  but if i had to pick t'would be a Doggio :D<br>  <br>  there awesomsauce <br>  <br>  SA.... ul     x]
OrvTG44laa	So your dad thinks that it'll just die again?  Give him evidence that the guinea pig's death wasn't your fault- maybe find some facts online about how many pet store animals are sick.  Convince him that you took care of it, but it was sick and wasn't going to live.  Show him how you take care of your other pets, so you could obviously have taken care of the guinea pig, but it was sick.|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Maybe just explain to him how badly you want one. And the biggest thing is pay for them yourself. Maybe he just doesn't want to spend the money one them. Save up and offer to pay for everything they need. Good Luck|`|JNnSMh64aa	Is your dad put off because your guinea pig was sick and died? Well, explain to him that shelter guinea pigs have a 90 percent chance of being healthier. Because they do not come from places like APET  or Rainbow Farms, they are almost never diseased. If you want to do some serious convincing, show him a video of one of those two places, and he will understand.|`|b3ZLY5osaa	dads... tell him you will learn more responsibility and pay for it yourself and take care of it yourself
6xijgfxDaa	500 bucks a hour or just loot the house while they are gone|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I also dog-sit on a regular basis.  Although with my 'client', her dog comes to my home and I dog sit 24 hours a day for the whole weekend.  She's a very well behaved and well trained dog though, so its actually a joy to watch her.  The original agreed payment was going to be $15 a day, but I love that dog so much, I now do it for free.  Since the gasoline reimbursement has already been discussed and all you are doing is letting the dogs out and feeding them, I would assume that roughly the same amount would be fair.<br>  <br>  Since its such a long drive and you'll have to be doing it twice a day, is it possible that the animals could just stay with you?  It would probably be easier on everyone.  Or perhaps you could spend the weekend (or week or however long she'll be gone) at their house.  You could give the dogs lots of exercise and attention and also keep an eye on the house.  You'd also save on gas money.  My sister use to house-sit all the time and really enjoyed it.  Since she was also watering the plants and making sure the house was securely locked up and such on top of the chores with the animals, they payed her $30 a day.
ld2vmypNaa	TWO  RES's in a 72 gal tank is plenty!!  ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their  is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  ""Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for all land and aquatic turtles<br>  <br>   Great site !!<br>  <br>  <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. <br>  All species are different in sizes to their kind.<br>  Sliders for the basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ year’s plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And  are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across.<br>  Maps and musks are smaller.<br>  <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle. ** When I got these two girls 37 yrs ago all we had to feed them back them were brown worms, tadpoles I caught  and goldfish. And my girls are still going strong and  just turned 37 yrs old this month.<br>  As one of THEE best top guys 'Oikos' says, You can that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it that’s fine!! Toss in a cuttle bone or chick of plaster fore the added calcium.<br>  Calcium is for their bones and will not cure fungus.<br>  <br>  **Add 1/4 of a cup of aquarium salt per 5 gallons to irritate and hopefully kill fungus. The addition of sulfa drugs such as those sold at pet stores under the name "Dr. Turtle" also should help kill fungus. Here is one source that sells Dr. Turtle. They also now sell a Sulfa dip by Zoo Med to treat bacteria and/or fungus.<br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell from dirty water.<br>  Respiratory  sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose.<br>    Swollen eyes due to lack of vitamin A fruits and veggies.<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin go to petco and get some fungus meds.<br>   Metabolic bone disease means an  inadequate calcium and/or a vitamin D3 deficiency. The earliest symptoms are the softening of the plastron, underside of the shell, and the rear marginal’s, back edge of the shell. When examining for metabolic bone disease, apply slight, gentle pressure to these areas. Applying too much force and pressure can injure the turtles. Be gentle!

You need a fungicide that is designed for use on turtles. And do it quickly. You should also drain the tank, clean it with bleach (10%), then rinse it several times before putting the turtles back in.|`|ptKp7mBJaa	Do not add another turtle the two you have have not finished growing. Red ears live about 50-100 yrs so they will be growing more just very slowly. The key to keeping RESs healthy lies in how often you change the water and the temp. of your basking spot. You need to change the water minimum of once a week no matter how powerful the filter because of the ammonia. A powerful filter will keep the water looking clean but will not remove the urates (turtle pee). So although the water looks clean it isn't which can lead to skin issues. As for the basking spot, you need it to be big enough for both turtles to fit on and it needs to reach a temp. in the 90s and provide both UVA and UVB rays. Your RESs need to be able to get completely dry to keep their shells in good health. Not having the proper basking spot can lead to shell rot, fungus and other skin/shell issues.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to get another turtle you will have to up your water changes to about every 4 days and increase the size of your basking spot considering that RESs tend to get about 8-12 inches though it takes about 8-10 years to get there.<br>  <br>  more info on RES caer: <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilesturtles/a/reslidercare.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/reptilest...</a>|`|O1VcREmJaa	Their RES will have a shorter life if they are stunting its growth.

You shouldn't actually have two in one.
LQLx0fGGaa	I have worked with Bostons for 15 years. First off there is a product you can buy called "Bitter Apple" it comes in a spray as well as a cream,  I perfer the spray, and I've never had it stain anything, it is great for puppy biting of your hands too!! it just tastes nasty, so if you can put it on "whatever" he tends to be chewing and this may discourage the behavior without you even saying a word. Secondly, make sure he has tons of things of "His own" that he CAN chew on, when he has something that is "off limits for chewing" simply remove it from him, and take his toy and put it in his mouth, using your thumb in the corner of his mouth will open his mouth, so you can put his toy in it gently, then he will eventually figure out what is his to chew and what is not. There are many many ways to teach a puppy what you want or don't want them to do, but some things work with some pups and some things just don't. Just be consistant and you will see he will "Get it"...He's a Boston, he simply wants you to be the happiest owner on earth! ENJOY! I hope this helps!!|`|enC9TvxUaa	He is just overly sensative.  Better this way than to be bull headed and not listen to you at all!|`|K8t1lPXsaa	the boston is labeled as a "sensitive" breed. so raising your voice from your normal level like a stern no or even looking at them like you're upset can make the dog sad. some have a higher sensitivity level than others. build his confidence so he won't be so shy about it. proper socializing helps with a lot of issues|`|S5Lz35myaa	I've raised Boston for years, and they are all different - some very stubborn, some very fragile.  For your dog, definitely discipline him when he does something wrong, however, tone it down just a little.  The dog still needs to know you are not happy with them, assuming you catch them in the act of doing something wrong. <br>  When the dog goes off on their own, just let them be.  By you telling them it's okay, you are confirming that he is doing right by hiding.<br>  Just correct him when he's wrong, and let him be.  He will soon learn what he can and cannot do, and will still love you even when you correct him.|`|wPbKdsM3aa	He's just different than the other dog.<br>  I have a boston terrior too! He chews on a lot too. Once he gets older he'll stop if you train him right. When he's chewing on something he shouldnt, tap him on the nose and give him his toy that way he knows what and what not to chew on.|`|fd128e6dd53f23c458b122434b95af0baa	He is probably just a little more sensitive that your other dog.  Try a less firm hand or a less direct approach to discipline.  |`|v5Hopf0Kaa	Boston Terriers only want to please you so when you say no firmly it does think you are going to give it away. Try keeping you things away from him and get some chew toys.  |`|ikJRVGfzaa	I like the look of a miniature pinscher.

Abitava al quarto piano di una palazzina e non le andava l'idea di tenere il gatto sempre chiuso in appartamento.<br>  Così fin da cucciolo lo ha abituato ad andare in giro col guinzaglio (la pettorina e il guinzaglio estendibile). <br>  Il gatto non si è mai ribellato, anzi, mi raccontava che quando aveva voglia di uscire attirava la padrona dove era appeso il guinzaglio.<br>  Magari non era completamente libero di fare i suoi giri e le arrampicate sugli alberi, ma almeno non è mai finito sotto un'auto che, in quella via, passano davvero veloci.|`|NaGbV8Dkaa	Sì ma occorre abituarli ed è difficile. Dovresti utilizzare la pettorina e non il collare normale e dovresti abituare il micio fin dai primi mesi di vita, da grande difficilmente imparerà. Inoltre secondo me è meglio usare quei guinzagli allungabili.|`|f7TGgy4oaa	se li abitui da piccoli si!<br>  mia mamma ha raccontato che fino a una decina di anni fa portava a spasso la gatta persiana di mia nonna con tanto di collarino e guinzaglio!!!!|`|oD3BdfRvaa	Io quando ho avuto un gatto ce lo portavo...

What you are likely seeing is his floppy sack that is going to slowly start disappearing.. if that's not what you see, then you should be taking him in  to the vet for a check up.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	a neutered dog will have swelling in the area where his testicles were but after a few days to a week there should be no swelling or odd coloration. if it looks odd in that area i would suggest taking him to the vet|`|M29CSlm3aa	If your dog was neutered he doesn't have testicles.  If you are referring to the fur over his sheath then it may just be his coloring.|`|NEpjg6JPaa	Got no idea why but my puppy's sack is black as well. He went to the vet to have is stitches out last week and they didn't say anything so I presumed it was ok....|`|QMwluxdBaa	If your dog still has testicles he is not fixed , at least not properly. And if they are black go to an emergency vet. Sounds like he is starting to get an infection.|`|TkWw5kWcaa	When I had my pup desexed, I noticed that afterwards the area where his testies would have been were swollen and and kinda purle blackish- I rang the vet and they said that's normal coz it was swollen and the black/purple were bruises- though I think by the time stitches came up, the area was not swollen and the colouring was back tp pink.<br>  <br>  I mean it just doesn't sound right if this has continued for 1 mth post surgery- can you ring the vet just to ask him what's going on and if your pup needs to go in for a check up?
MxXuuooaaa	they are defently dying....<br>  <br>  are you keeping them in a bowl or an unfiltered tank??? please do research before you get any type of fish.|`|ea073a7e51b6c89785bcfc0713212cf2aa	You probably have them in a tank that is too small and poorly filtered/aereted.<br>  <br>  Goldfish need:<br>  <br>  20 gallons of water PER FISH.<br>  <br>  A filter twice the size of the suggestion on the box.  (I.e., the filter box says 100 gallons, use it on a 50 gallon goldfish tank.)<br>  <br>  Very powerful aeration (think bubble rods) because they put so much ammonia into the water that all the oxygen is force out, and needs to be put back in.<br>  <br>  COLD water!  If you have a heater in there anywhere, you're boiling your goldfish.<br>  <br>  Frequent water changes to help keep the water clean.<br>  <br>  I'm sure if you look at your set up, you'll see that you're missing one or all of these requirements.  That is why your goldfish are dying.|`|cIdnmGcTaa	Killing them with boiling water is horrible. How would you like to die in such an inhumane way. And don't just say 'they are only goldfish'. They're still an animal. My fish done that, but it was because the water was too cold, and also because it was overweight from being loved too much. It eventually died, so i'm afriad there is probably nothing you can do. Try switching it's water, put it in fresh water, see if they improve. Just try anything with temperature, to diet. Do they still eat?<br>  <br>  Wish you the best for your goldy's!|`|6tchyPCbaa	They probably are dying.<br>  If you wish you can end it quickly and put boiling water in the tank.<br>  Maybe there is something wrong with the filter and it's causing problems with the water so the fish can't breathe?<br>  Try putting them into a bowl of water(not tank water) and see if they improve.<br>  If not do step one and boil them.|`|8WqXRV4Oaa	Unfortunately it is hard to diagnose why fish will suddenly die. A few people here have given you several good reasons, I have put a website below for you to check out, it lists symptoms and causes for goldfish deaths.  Please, like several other people here have mentioned if you do need to hasten their death don't do it with boiling water.  I read years  ago in a book about koi and pond fish that if you must euthanize a fish the "kinder" method is to put it into a plastic bag filled with cold water and add a tbsp. of salt and then place the bag in the freezer. This will slow down the fish's heart until it passes away.  I know it sounds cruel too, but not quite as bad as the boiling water method.|`|trbNJrJbaa	their dying, theres nothing you can do id sound stupid if i said take them to the vets, if there going to die unfortunatly they are. there is nothing you can do.|`|y1lMex7Faa	there dying

VOGX6orvaa	Dogs are very perceptive that way, they remember little things for a very long time. If someone saved your life, wouldn't you remember them?? I agree with you. Like, when our family first went to see my grandparents new dog(samba), samba didn't like my dad. she cowered and was very tense whenever he came around. However, she didn't do that with my brother (who is the same size as my dad) or anyone else. I think it was because my dad used to work at a pound and he used to put dogs to sleep ( i know =( so sad). I think samba knew somehow about his past...kind of a long shot, but i believe it!|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	You are right & your old man is wrong.  They remember a lot.  A dog I hadn't seen in about 4 years remembered me.  Dogs are pretty smart & they do remember who had done them wrong.<br>  <br>  Did you ever see a dog cower to someone but be so over joyed to see someone else?  They remember.  <br>  <br>  Woman right !!! Man wrong !!!  Yea, Yea, yea
VOGX6orvaa	Well, male dogs tend to be more cuddly, but females tend to be smarter. It also costs more to get a female fixed. From my experience (owned 7 dogs), i prefer male dogs, they just seem to have more rounded personalities.
wyKtaAiTaa	Have the vet check it out to make sure that it isn't a sign of gum disease or anything like that.  Otherwise, you can brush his teeth with doggie toothpaste (don't use the human stuff) and give him dental treats.  Bright Bites are a good brand to use - they have the VOHC seal.<br>  <a href="http://brightbites.com" rel="nofollow">http://brightbites.com</a>|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Raw meaty bones - nature's toothbrush. A good bone for a dog the size of yours would be a chicken drumstick or thigh cutlet.<br>  <br>  The meat flosses between the teeth and massages gums while the edible bones scrape plaque and tartar off the teeth.<br>  <br>  And yes it can be something to worry about, this is a sign of build up on the teeth and gums which can lead to periodontal disease which has proven links to organ failure and auto-immune diseases.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	i would not feed a dog that size bones or rawhides. it's more of a choking hazard than for medium to large breeds. you should buy a dog toothbrush kit with toothbrush, finger brush and dog toothpaste. brush weekly. if you don't feel comfortable doing this most groomers and vets will do it for you. vets will charge you more though because they will typically put the dog to sleep with anesthesia.<br>  <br>  get greenies, they're slightly expensive treats but they'll take the plaque off. some dogs simply don't like the taste of greenies though and in that case look around a pet store for other biscuit type treats that state it fights plaque. if you don't take care of the plaque your dog will be in danger of losing all of its teeth|`|jyVCzVlDaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  If there's a problem with your dog's teeth, the first sign is often bad breath, caused when bacteria begin to multiply in food trapped between teeth or at the site of an infection.

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Oh my, you're just full of questions today. :-)<br>  <br>  1.) I believe dogs begin to lose their puppy coats at about one year of age. It varies from individual to individual, though. Some may be as early as eight months, and some as late as a year and a half.<br>  <br>  2.) As she gets older, you'll have to watch out for the same problems as with any dog.. resource guarding, territorial behaviors, shyness, aggression..<br>  Shelties have high herding instincts, so as she grows older, you might have to watch for that. They love to chase and herd, so be sure not to let her loose in an unsafe area because her instincts might overpower her.<br>  She's five months old, so watch for dermatomyositis, which occurs between four and six months of age and presents itself as alopecia in certain areas. Shelties are also susceptible to hypothyroidism, epilepsy, Von Willebrand disease, eye problems, hip dysplasia, or skin allergies. Mini aussies are susceptible to hip and eye problems, too.<br>  Both breeds are extremely intelligent and energetic, so as she grows up, you'll really have to exercise her well. She'll need LOTS of stimulation, both mental and physical, to stay happy and well-behaved.<br>  <br>  3.) I do not have this mix. The closest I have is a friend with a mini aussie, who does love him.<br>  <br>  4.) Mini ausland sheepherd? Mini ausland shepdog? Australian sheepdog? Mini australian shetland? Shaussie? Austie? Ooh, I like mini austie (Mini aussie and sheltie).<br>  <br>  5.) I think the most valuable way to help her learn how to train the puppy would be for you both to attend puppy kindergarten. Most of them encourage the whole family to come so that everyone learns the same thing, I bet you'd have a good time, too.<br>  <br>  6.) A sudden, loud distraction usually make a dog stop barking. Try a short, sharp blow on a whistle, airhorn, banging something, whatever, but make sure your timing is good, and make sure you're loud, abrupt -- and out of sight! <br>  Both dogs in her mix are extremely intelligent, so it might be a great idea to train her out of it. You can train a dog to bark on cue, and then you can teach them to stop on cue.<br>  Anticipate when she is going to bark, or do something that you know will make her bark. Juuust before she barks, say "Speak!," or whatever command you choose. Then she barks, and you throw a party with treats and praise. Once she has "Speak" down pat (which probably won't take long), start on "Quiet." Since you've been rewarding her for barking, she'll probably be pretty confused when you suddenly stop throwing a party every time she barks. Unless you specifically command her to bark, ignore her if she does. She'll wonder what's up, and that's when you throw a huge party for being quiet. Slap the command on it, and say it just as she hushes up, then reward her. <br>  <br>  7.) Be the leader of both pups. When she's barking at the other puppy or growling at him, come between them. Don't punish her at this time, because that may give her the wrong message. She might think that she's being punished for the other puppy being around, which would then make her increase her attempts to make the other puppy go away so that she doesn't get in trouble by growling and barking.<br>  Anyway, stand between them. Break it up, and distract them, you know, "ah-ah-ahh" or something, kind of like two squabbling kids, even though she's the trouble-maker. The barking probably isn't much of a problem, but do intervene when she growls, at least. Just block her until she is redirected and no longer focused on the other puppy.<br>  <br>  8.) <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?rls=com.microsoft:*:IE-SearchBox&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=ie7&rlz=1I7DKUS&um=1&q=Interlachen,+Fl+dog+park&fb=1&view=text&sa=X&oi=local_group&resnum=4&ct=more-results&cd=1" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?rls=com.micr...</a><br>  I recommend that you only bring your older chihuahua there for now. A five-month-old puppy is too impressionable; a bad encounter with a nasty dog there could really traumatize her. For now, socialize the heck out of her, but only with dogs you know won't try to kill her!<br>  <br>  9.) Yes, clicker training does really work, especially for such intelligent dogs.<br>  <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickertraining.com/</a><br>  <br>  10.) Will she be using the puppy pads for her entire life? If you expect her to ever relieve herself /outdoors/, do not use them now. You will confuse her. You'll be effectively teaching her only to eliminate indoors, and she'll be totally lost when you suddenly decide that it's wrong to go inside and that she must only go outdoors. <br>  I don't advocate using them, but if you must, then just correct her when she plays on them. Make a sharp noise ("EH-EH!"), separate her from the pad, and put it back. Every time she tries to play with it, stop her! Teach her that it is only for doing her business on. Hopefully she'll catch on.<br>  <br>  11.) Wait, who does she growl at? The cat? Okay, that's not too bad.<br>  If she ever guards her food from a human, that's a big problem:<br>  <a href="http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/resource-guarding/" rel="nofollow">http://ahimsadogtraining.com/blog/resour...</a><br>  If you dislike how she goes after the cat or |`|x6GIgJ5caa	I love the personality of a australian shepherd.

Bad breeders mix small aussies with shelties, poms, and chihuahuas to get small aussie-ish dogs they call mini aussies.<br>  1. Shelties and aussies both dont get their full adult coat until after a year<br>  <br>  2. Take her to training classes and you should have a well behaved dog, both breeds are very intelligent breeds. Health issues would worry me though with her being from what sounds like questionable breeding.<br>  <br>  3.

I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old.<br>   <br>  REVISIONS: <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you.<br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever.<br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them. <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak of
a9YfUGzSaa	Dogs manage GREAT on three legs, they adapt beautifully.  I took a three legged dog out at my shelter today and I went into her cage, petted her, attached her leash, and brought her across the grounds before I even noticed.  She can run and play just as well.<br>  <br>  She has a video with one of our walkers on the grounds here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=12030804" rel="nofollow">http://search.petfinder.com/petnote/disp...</a><br>  <br>  We wouldn't adopt her to a home with other animals or kids just because she probably would have a hard time with rougher play, but you will have that problem with prosthetic, too.|`|AIQ6taIUaa	The dog doesn't need a prosthetic leg.  They're capable of running at the same speeds with 3 legs as they are with 4.  Also, the dog will gnaw on the leg.  To the dog, it will be in the way.<br>  <br>  If you need one, you could talk to a vet.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	dogs can get around just fine with only three legs. though they might have a little difficulty at first. i'm not aware of any prosthetics for dogs especially if it's only one leg
AA11545997	If  you can afford it, deffinatly ship the dog by plane, its a lot quicker and less stressfull for the dog.<br>  Call the airline and ask how much to ship the dog.<br>  It shouldn't be more than you'd pay for a ticket for yourself.<br>  Also, the dog will need to be in a pet crate. Are you buying it or is the seller giving you one with the dog?|`|MuD5oXQQaa	Ship by plane.

AA10421992	I wouldn't feed neither one.<br>  I feed my dogs Natural Balance.<br>  |`|j2albguDaa	compare the ingredients and do some research.  science diet is definately better.  beneful is not.  |`|aCqSF87Raa	I agree - most brands that you find in commercial stores (wal mart, price chopper, etc) are not good foods. Purina, Pedigree, Beneful, Science Dite... all are poor foods. They contain very little meat and contain fillers , by-products, and corn (which is not easily digested by most dogs and is a common source of allergens.)<br>  <br>  The best kind of food to get is food that has actual meat listed as the top five ingredients. There should be no corn and very few grains (rice and a few others is okay though.) Here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Healthy-Dog-Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Healthy-Do...</a><br>  <br>  I feed Canidae. Wellness, Innova, EVO, and California Natural are a few foods that are good.|`|I5iWaBVwaa	Abbyful gave you an excellent answer.  I hope you really take heart of the info she's given you.<br>  <br>  As for those who say their dogs eat it & are "fine", think of it this way.  You *could* eat McDonald's, Taco Bell, Wendy's, etc every meal, every day and seem *fine*, but how do you REALLY think you'd be doing?  Especially if this was your habit for years.  You would continue walking, talking, breathing but would you truly be okay or would you be developing serious health issues and experiencing nasty signs & symptoms after a while?|`|AA11178252	They both suck. Vets recommend science diet because they get paid to. I use california natural for my dog. it doesnt have a bunch of fillers in it like science and purina.|`|G11IZ2HLaa	I agree 100% with Abbyful.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	nutritionally science diet and beneful are terrible. they both have been graded an F for dog nutrition. beneful has been listed as the worst dog food to feed. it is nothing but fillers and dyes. basically you'd just be feeding your dog colorful sawdust chips. <br>  <br>  some vets will tell you science diet because the get funding from the company. i always recommend holistics. it's a little more but it's worth it. just feed a weeks worth of holistics and see how much better they look.<br>  <br>  personally i feed all of my dogs innova|`|kUnvlr3Oaa	Hi! :)<br>  You got a lot of great answers, like from Abbyful.  My vet recomends Eukunuba and Pro Plan more than Science Diet but endorses them all very much.  They are all full of "fillers" though like corn.  Beneful is to.  You can find high quality puppy chow with fruits and vegetables.  Some examples being Merrick, Solid Gold, Blue Buffalo, etc....|`|hB1SkPqRaa	What does your dog like and do well on? That's what you stick with as long as it is a good, brand name food. Science diet is fine too and is sold by many vets maybe that's why he recommended it. Switching around the diet can upset the dogs system and encourage pickiness. |`|bUtl3fDkaa	Neither Eukanuba or Science Diet are very good, and Beneful is absolutely horrid.<br>  <br>  Vets aren't nutritionists, they are animal doctors. They get very little schooling in nutrition, and what they do get is written by Hills, the makers of Science Diet.<br>  <br>  Some examples of GOOD foods appropriate for a puppy are:<br>  * Merrick Puppy Plate<br>  * Wellness Just for Puppy<br>  * Innova Puppy<br>  * Canidae All-life-states<br>  * Artemis Fresh-Mix Small breed puppy<br>  * Chicken Soup for the Puppy Lover's Soul<br>  <br>  === ===<br>  <br>  Read the ingredients before you buy.<br>  <br>  Here is my "short list" of rules when I am looking at dog food ingredients:<br>  1) When I chose a dog food, I chose one high meat content. I want to see preferably at least 2-3 out of the top 5 ingredients be meat or meat meal (first ingredient must be!). Meal is simply the meat with the moisture removed.<br>  2) I want to see higher quality grains, such as barley, brown rice, and oatmeal, instead of seeing wheat and corn. Or an alternative starch/carbohydrate such as potatoes or sweet potatoes.<br>  3) I don't want to see any byproducts.<br>  4) I don't want to see a lot of fillers (brewers rice, beet pulp, etc).<br>  5) I don't want to see preservatives that are believed to be carcinogens (BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin).<br>  6) I don't want to see artificial colorings such as the Red, Blue, and Yellow dyes.<br>  7) I don't want to see added sugars (sugar, corn syrup).<br>  8) I don't want to see mystery meats (meats identified only as "meat" or "poultry".)<br>  <br>  Here is an article about byproducts:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=ingrd" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  And an article on what ingredients to avoid:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  There is no food that is the *best*, different individual dog may thrive on different foods. What is best for one may not be the best for the next. And just because a food is good quality, it doesn't mean it will jive the best for your dog.<br>  <br>  What you want to find is the HIGH-QUALITY food that *your dog* does best on.<br>  <br>  Here are some examples of GOOD dog foods:<br>  * Artemis Fresh Mix<br>  * Blue Buffalo<br>  * California Natural<br>  * Canidae<br>  * Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul<br>  * Eagle Pack Holistic Selects<br>  * EVO<br>  * Fromm Four Star<br>  * Innova<br>  * Merrick<br>  * Nature's Variety<br>  * Orijen<br>  * Solid Gold<br>  * Taste of the Wild<br>  * Wellness<br>  * ZiwiPeak<br>  <br>  Or check this website; the 4, 5, or 6 star rated foods are all good foods. <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Higher quality food may seem more expensive at first, but it evens out. The higher quality the food, the less fillers eaten (and therefore the less poop comes out the other end). Your dog eats more of a low-quality food to try to get the nutrition it needs, and most of the food just passes right on through. Also, higher-quality food will make your animals healthier, so you save money on vet bills in the long run.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  What *NOT* to buy:<br>  <br>  Stay away from grocery stores brands. They are low-quality foods chalk full of fillers, preservatives, dyes, etc.. (Grocery store foods are those like Beneful, Old Roy, Alpo, Pedigree, Purina, etc.)<br>  <br>  Beware "premium" foods. "Premium" does not always mean good nutritionally, and is not a nutritionally high quality food. Most of these foods have the same types of ingredients as grocery store foods, just a bit better quality of those not-so-good ingredients. (Premium foods are those like Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Bil-Jac, Royal Canin, etc..)<br>  <br>  Another thing to be wary of: A lot of vets will recommend what they sell in their office. They get profit from the brands they keep on their shelves, that's why they push it. Truth is, vet schools don't focus a lot on nutrition. It's not saying that a vet is a bad vet because he recommends those foods, a lot of vets just are told "this is good food", so they pass the message along without proper nutrition knowledge. Also, some dog food brands (like Hills) support vet schools, so vets have heard of it from the time they start college, which makes them think it's good as well.<br>  <br>  Hills company, the makers of Science Diet, are heavily involved in vet schools. "Hill's scientists author more than 50 research papers and textbook chapters each year and teach at leading schools of veterinary medicine" (Source of quoted section: <a href="http://www.hillsvet.com/hillsvet/ourCompany/ourCompany.hjsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hillsvet.com/hillsvet/ourComp...</a> )<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "Big box" petstores like Petco and Petsmart rarely have quality foods. (There are some higher quality foods at those locations, but most of the foods aren't.)<br>  * Blue Buffalo<br>  * Castor & Pollux<br>  * Eagle Pack Holistic Selects<br>  * Natural Balance<br>  * Solid Gold<br>  * Wellness<br>  <br>  Also, grocery stores and Walmart aren't good places to buy food either.<br>  <br>  Your best bets for getting quality dog food are:<br>  - small, locally owned petstores<br>  - dog boutiques<br>  - farm supply stores<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  When switching foods, do it gradually. I do this over about a two week timespan:<br>  25% food A, 75% food B<br>  50% food A, 50% food B<br>  75% food A, 25% food B<br>  100% food A<br>  .|`|rfI3CrwQaa	Sometimes, your vet is just not the person to go to when you're concerned about your dog's nutrition. When I had concerns about my dog food, my vet merely suggested the dog food (Eukanuba and Science Diet) which they sold in the lobby. So I went elsewhere for information.<br>  <br>  I feed one of my dogs Solid Gold and the other eats Blue Buffalo. There's an interesting book you can read called "Food Pets Die For." It's pretty informative about the way dog food companies regulate, or don't regulate, the production of dog food.<br>  <br>  Please stay away from dog foods sold in grocery stores and places like Walmart if you want your dog to live longer. They are there just for your convenience and their price is attractive to people who do not know better.<br>  <br>  Dogs may like Beneful, but some also enjoy eating garbage and feces. Beneful dog food has GREAT advertising. They can put just about anything they want on the front of the bag, but it is the ingredients you should be reading.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	The information you are missing here is that vets are paid to promote Science Diet. Of course he would say that--he'll want you to buy from him as well.<br>  <br>  Both are junk foods. Eukanuba is a pretty bad food too. He has something with the vegetables--you want to keep veggies to a minimum, but a few are good. You'll most definately want to avoid corn, and *all* those foods you listed use corn as a filler.<br>  <br>  Here's a great website that rates dog foods, you'll want four star and higher. It will also tell you what to avoid in foods, and exactly *what* is right and wrong with each food.

ydshiNrKaa	Put him in his crate while the people are entering and leave him there until things settle down.  No contact with him whatsoever.  Once he is settled in his crate, then let him out.  If he starts running and jumping around, back in the crate until he settles down.  Also tell your guests not to interact with him either. No eye contact, no talking to him, etc.  He should eventually get the idea that when he's calm he's allowed out of the crate and when he's jumping etc. he goes into the crate.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Well one suggestion is to make the dog do a sit stay and enforce that with treats if need be, many dogs are food driven and as he learns better reduce traits and use praise.  The other suggestion is to take him outside to greet guests making sure they go into the house first and that they turn there backs at his behavior and when he calms give praise and treats but it takes time especially in a young high strung dog...He wants attention and if he does not get it he will learn the  right way of doing it.Also do not pet and cuddle him and get crazy trying to restrain him..just have quests turn away and ignore bad behavior for awhile. Should take a few weeks of this 3 times a day. You can also condition him by having a roommate or friend ring the doorbell or knock and if he stays put he gets rewarded, the other person does not enter until he is calm.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	take your dog to an obedience class. if need be find a place where you can tie the dog with the leash and still be looking at the door. have someone come over or a family member knock at the door to fake a scenario. address his hyper activity immediately before you welcome your guest in|`|SxUKHL6gaa	don't get rid of it!<br>   you should take him to a trainer or puppy school or something but don't get rid of him unless you absolutely have to!|`|pVyw8xqeaa	my dog does the exact same thing!

My dog jumps all over the guests and its very embarassing! hope this helps :)|`|Suo7eHjiaa	teach it to heel <br>  it will bark to alert everybody but its just what dogs do|`|izZjI7jFaa	Crate him while you have guests, and don't let him out unless/until he is calm; I recommend waiting at least 20 minutes after they arrive. This may mean that he gets re-crated when he isn't successful in calming. Reprimand him with a sharp loud "NO" and one loud startle noise (hand clap, coin can rattle, newspaper popping) when he misbehaves.<br>  <br>  Ignore him and don't pet him while guests are there. He should be made to lay down away from all of you. Don't let him sit in between or anywhere in the conversation area.<br>  <br>  Watch The Dog Whisperer for more tips.

So avoid getting him hurted even if it is by accident.<br>  Feed him on time, and usually dogs don't like being watched when having food.<br>  Don't scold him unnecessarily, or long after he has made any mistake. He will get confused.<br>  Take him out for round daily on fix time, he will be waiting for it.<br>  Reward and praise him when he does a good job or he is nice to you. Dogs understand all these.<br>  Don't fight at home in his presence.<br>  Don't disturb him when he is sleeping, dogs also do require good sleep.

Take him back to the vet and have him checked.|`|K8t1lPXsaa	bruising and swelling should heal after 2-3 days as long as you follow the vets recommendation for after surgery care. he should't be running, jumping or licking the area for about a week. if he is get him an e collar. otherwise take him back to the vet
K8t1lPXsaa	it depends on the breed as well as the individual dogs. a lot of little dogs can be yappy. some have difficulty being trained not to bark others are easier. many say yorkies are yappy but i own a yorkie and he only barks when someone is at the door. as soon as i get up to see who it is he doesn't make another peep. it did take a little training but he got the concept pretty quickly and he had three older dogs(big dogs) to help. with proper training most little dogs can be taught not to be yappy but screaming at them to shut up is not training and if that is your method then don't bother.<br>  <br>  your best bet is to find a dog that meets your other requirements, not just size but also activity level, grooming, exercise, temperament etc. observe a litter and see how they react to new people. if they're really loud, yappy and happy expect the dog to greet newcomers like that. if they come up with a wagging tail and is quiet that's your dog. if they're shy and just look at you or go huddle in the corner you don't want that one either.|`|jiwTWNNtaa	I can't speak for all rat terriers, but mine is not yappy.

They are a Golden Retriever in a little body only not hyper. They are the perfect breed of dog. I have 6 Cavaliers and none of them are yappy. One of them doesn't even bark at all. The neighbors dogs will bark and mine don't ever join in. I take some of my dogs to work and they hang out with a Dachshund that barks aggressively at other dogs. My dogs are tied next to the Dachshund and my dogs don't bark. They just look at the Dachshund as if she is nuts.|`|69GgJhnWaa	It's not a matter of dog breeds, it's a matter of going through the trouble of training your dog to bark once or twice when someone is at the door only. However, if you want a dog that is fairly small and automatically quiet, there is a breed of dogs called Basenji's. They are bark-less.|`|re06t6zvaa	Papillion. they are sooo adorable ! look em up. |`|mlmSRkhGaa	one with no voice box|`|Z6itbzHZaa	It depends on the dog's personality. My mother has two Chihuahuas, a mother and a daughter. The daughter will bark and bark at anyone who comes to the door. She barks when she has to go out, she barks when she's hungry. She barks when she's ignored.  The mother, on the other hand, rarely makes any noise. She'll bark if she is startled, and when she wants attention, she'll sit on the floor and make quiet little whimpering noises, but aside from that, she's pretty much silent.<br>  If you want a small dog that's not yappy, I would research different small breeds, and when you find one you like, go to a reputable breeder, or a shelter, look over the puppies, and pick the one that seems the quietest to you.|`|y7NxQcIIaa	if you train a small dog and teach him to have manners he will be a good small dog.

V7AAba8Laa	You shouldn't try to stitch any injury on a rooster.  If it is a deep and penetrating wound, the area should be cleaned thoroughly and bleeding stopped with a clean piece of gauze to staunch the bleeding, followed by either styptic powder (for a smaller cut) or red kote.  For a larger or gaping wound, you can also dress the wound with clean surgical gauze and self-adhering medical tape, but avoid red kote, which can really sting.<br>  <br>  Do not apply any type of spray or wound heal on an injury around the head.  It is too easy to injure their eyes or cause respiratory damage.<br>  <br>  Chickens are pretty resilient, and on the rare occasion that someone gets injured, often times I've found it's best just to clean the wound and follow up with a round of powdered vitamins and antibiotic in the water for about a 3 day cycle.  Separate the injured bird from the rest of the flock to prevent others from picking on it.<br>  <br>  Trying to stitch a wound is more likely to cause further injuries or infection.  And rushing to seal the wound up can also seal bacteria or foreign matter inside the wound, ultimately causing more infection risk.  Clean the area, stop the bleeding, dress the wound and monitor the bird for several days or until it's on the road to being healthy again.  <br>  <br>  You also need to correct the problem that caused the injury in the first place.  Check for broken fencing, jagged wire, or if multiple roosters are fighting, either pen or pasture birds separately or consider culling the aggressive ones.  You are more likely to see fighting among the boys this time of year (spring is in the air and hormones are in overdrive), so if you can't separate them to keep the peace, consider getting rid of some - especially if the fighting is causing serious injury.|`|AA11371251	how did the rooster get that cut? from cock fighting cuz that's illegal and if your doing illegal things then...well hopefully you get caught

9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	There are many reasons why parakeets chew. Parakeets have a natural instinct to build nests out of whatever they have available. It helps keep his beak from overgrowing.   He most likely is just living in a cage where he gets bored sometimes and it's fun for him to shred his sandpaper.  I have a cockatoo that loves to destroy phone books, just for his enjoyment.|`|lAjgMFTTaa	could b because its bored - maybe get it some toys and let it out more often. it could also be that its trying to grind its beak, but has nothing to do it on - your supposed to put a pot of special bird sand in its cage for it to grind it's teeth.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|r7I7FoNMaa	Sandpaper?  Hope it is NOT on the perch.  Get it out of the cage.  Inhumane for hookbills who do not need grit of any kind.<br>  <br>  This may also be a nest making activity.  Remove it anyway.|`|emQL8faEaa	maybe coz its bored with all the toys it as get them some new 1s|`|7MzldDHYaa	That is just their natural instinct.They LOVE to chew and chew some more!

Maybe put some toys down there instead.|`|7sb7QqAEaa	Sandpaper shouldnt be in their cage anyway unless its on a grit/cement perch ( and in that case it should have another perch that isnt a cement perch).<br>  <br>  Your bird might be bored when its not in the cage, try adding a few toys.
nlRr07dRaa	you made the mistake of giving him a partner...... Cockatiels are Mono whatever it's called only one partner.. when it was just you and the bird, you where birds of a feather. when you got him a female, she's now his significant other. if you would have acclimated them both together inside, and kept the relationship, youd' probably be like three's company. since you put them both outside, they 've made their family without you part of it. you need to keep trying to make your way into the family. or you can just let them be....|`|r7I7FoNMaa	You created this by getting him a mate and leaving them alone outside.  Do you live in Florida?.  He 'wanted' a mate???  If that is true, he was not getting enough love from you.  Now you have given him back to the wild. He is fearful - that is what hissing is.  A fear response.<br>  <br>  Remove him from the large cage and put him back into his old cage.  Find the female a good home.  Begin, again, to tame your little friend.<br>  As long as the female is in sight/hearing, he will be bonded to her and not you.  This is a common mistake single bird owners make. Sad to say the bird transfers his love from YOU to her.  Then being left alone for a long time added to his wildness.|`|9696d265a6939e3f0b0d367627909159aa	Think about how long it has been since he was in this environment.  His natural instincts are to be afraid of anything new and unfamiliar.  <br>  To tame him down, the easiest is a couple of step process.  1.) Separate him from his girlfriend.  Put them in two different cages beside each other.  Then in a few weeks separate the cages in the same room.  Then, in a few weeks put him in a different room.  2.) Get his wings clipped.  If you don't know how, take him to a vet or pet store so they are done right. You can let them grow back after he has tamed down, but it's much easier to tame him with them clipped.  <br>  3.) Start letting him come out of his cage on his own.  Eventually he will be less afraid of you.  When you get here he should start back to being the bird you remember.  He's hissing and running away in fear, but eventually he will start to remember what an awesome time the two of you used to have.

Try checking on ebay for a pessoa gen x or a/o. I had a gen x and loved it. Also, ebay may seem fishy to some, but i bought a 3,000$ Butet for 1,500$ and i absolutely LOVE it. Ebay worked for me, i would check it out.

Try a second hand saddle from a friend (if theyre selling it...) or go to your local tack store and ask to try one if you find a suitable saddle. You could also buy one from the internet, but makesure it is a respectable make (wintec, jeffries, albion, black country...) and see what theyre returns policy is so that you can send it back if it doesnt fit the horse too well.|`|503d9ec02105447e5fb64bf3f4d54952aa	horse.com|`|xi6avrGgaa	Donot waste your time more.

1JT6wjzraa	Depending on where you live, If you adopt an animal you could be saving a life. (there is a no kill policy where i am)<br>  The animal will already be fixed (usually), it is cheaper than buying froma  breeder or pet store.<br>  The animal will most likely be mroe social due to being in a shelter and being around other animals.<br>  <br>  But for me the biggest one is that you could save it's life! :-)|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	Because all animals deserve a loving and safe home and for many if they stay at the shelter long they will be put down.They did nothing to earn or deserve this but it is the way it is.Some should be put down I do agree with that.However the most of them are just there because they were not wanted.I have 3 rescues one was slated for put down.She has health problems and seizures but so loving,makes up for it.It is not her fault but bad breeding,she is purebred Shith tue,with papers and all.Still she was a result of bad breeding or so the vet says.There are 50 dogs for every one who wants a dog already alive and living in the world,if people would stop buying and discarding just like an old shoe then every dog could have a home.Just because you pay money for one doesn't Always mean you get quality.My dog's original owner paid $400.00 for her.And since that was over 8 years ago and in my state that was on the high side of the pricing.Well thats how I feel about it,it won't change anything I know but you asked.|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Great idea for an essay - there are so many reasons!<br>  <br>  1) Adopting saves lives, buying causes death!<br>  <br>  To explain.... Most pet animals suffer from overpopulation (more animals than homes). When you adopt an animal that is already "in the system" you reduce the overpopulation. When you buy an animal from a breeder or dealer / store you encourage more breeding - so you increase the overpopulation by a whole litter!<br>  <br>  Unwanted animals may end up in a "kill" or a "no-kill" shelter. If you adopt an animal from a "kill" shelter you literally save that animals life.<br>  If you adopt from a "no-kill" shelter - you save the lives of the next unwanted pet. No-kill shelter are always full because they don't put animals to sleep. This means they have to turn animals away- these animals end up killed at the vets, in a kill shelter, or dumped on the streets. Adopting from a no kill shelter enables them to save another life.<br>  <br>  When you buy from a breeder (directly or indirectly) you give them the "demand", by encouraging them to breed, giving them money etc. So the breeder breeds more. Every baby animal bred and sold takes away a home from a rescue animal.<br>  <br>  2) Dealers are the WORST place to get a pet, you should never buy any animals from a pet shop.<br>  <br>  When you buy an animal indirectly like this you have no way of knowing where or how the animal was bred and raised. You could be funding the most abusive mill breeders or back-yard breeders. You could be funding neglect, iresponsible breeding, even abuse.<br>  <br>  Pet stores also encourage impulse buying. Animals bought on impulse without any thought or research are the ones most likely to be neglected or dumped. The stores know this and do not care - they only care about profit!<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to stop puppy farms, breeding mills, etc is for people to stop buying animals from them!<br>  <br>  3) In most cases you are more likely to get a healthier / more suitable pet from a rescue.<br>  <br>  For example - small pets... Small animals bought from pet stores are frequently mis-sexed, pregnant or sick. They will have been housed in unsuitable cages, probably fed crap food, exposed to lots of other animals, and not given vet care.<br>  <br>  In a rescue, animals are given a thorough health check, and given any treatment necessary. All animals will be the correct sex, not pregnant and generally healthy.<br>  <br>  The decent diog / cat rescues are also very careful to match the right animal to the right home. They assess their animals - see if they are ok to be left, good with kids, other animals etc.... Animals with behaviour problems will only be sold to suitable homes capable of coping with them, or will go through "rehab" before they are put up for adoption.<br>  <br>  4) Rescue animals often work out better for your wallet too! <br>  <br>  For a start, adoption is usually cheaper than buying (especially dogs). Not only that but with dogs and cats, neutering, microchipping and vaccinating is included in the price.<br>  Many rescues have special schemes in place for elderly dogs or those with health problems - eg they offer to pay for the required treatment for the rest of the animals life.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|qxrr69bnaa	You'll be saving a life.  Most shelters allow their animals to be there only a few days before they're euthanized.|`|BljwgBNUaa	ADOPT ONE..<br>  ITS ALWAYS A LIL BETTER TO ADOPT A PUPPY OR DOG..<br>  MY POINT OF VIEW|`|yFwc1RqNaa	To help i tout<br>  <br>  plus its cheaper|`|HyqS3KFraa	aside from puppy mills... (research that!)... here's an eye opener that a BREEDER once gave me.<br>  <br>  I was strongly considering getting a husky from a breeder, instead of adopting.  I emailed a breeder, who said this...<br>  When you adopt from a breeder, the dogs are kept in a room or cage or confined area with any number of other dogs, other litters, etc... then many times they are shipped to you.  These dogs always end up sick and here is why<br>  Consider that we take one person from every single country in the world, and put them all in a room together.  Then everyone leaves, and the next day, that room still has not been cleaned, but the room needs to be used for another group of people, and so on and so on, every day.  SOMEONE, if not many people will end up sick from all the germs.  <br>  <br>  Similar with puppies.  Their crates are not cleaned, but re-used all the time. Dogs end up sick, vet bills go up, dog gets surrendered, owner finds another dog from another breeder... etc etc.  <br>  <br>  There are millions of reasons to adopt instead of buy from a breeder, but theres just one example.|`|HULRxii5aa	There are so many unwanted pets left to roam the streets where it is cold and windy and they are abandoned, alone, afraid. So they get taken into a shelter where they are kept in tight cages until someone finds a space in their hearts for the animal no-one loved. When they aren't, they are killed for taking up spaces for pets that have a chance. Now think, would you really want to buy an animal which is the exact same as one you can adopt, but they'll charge you for it and you don't give it a better life - a chance to know what real love from an owner is like. To save that puppy which was tied to a pier ready to die, or the kitten left in a box in the rain, waiting for someone - anyone to provide shelter from the harsh weather? I know which I would rather do, don't you?|`|5RXYx9c4aa	Because the poor animals that are in the homes (if they're older than a puppy, say 6, 7 years old or older) are going to get overlooked because they won't last as long, and that means they're spending the rest of their lives in shelters. That's harsh, because they don't get a long term loving home.

Try to remember when you have been real sick maybe with an ear infection and on antibiotics, it takes a few days before they  really get the job done. The next big thing to remember is just because she may seem well she must continue the medication the full course or she ill get  sick again.<br>  <br>  as far as having surgery at her age thee is nothing wrong with it. She should do just fine. Sure she is older and sure she probably only has 2 or 3 years left don't you want her to have pain free years? I had a older girl that had to have surgery and she did just fine.Sadly something completely differently took her life not much later but i am happy for the time she had pain free, even though it was very expensive.

MhW3pLhLaa	Yes, go get her friend. :) Guinea pigs are much more better off in pairs or groups. they are very social animals. But make sure that you get the guinea pig that was in the cage with the one you have now when you adopted her. If not, then you will have to put the new guinea pig in a separate cage to make sure it doesn't have a cold or anything that your guinea pig might catch. The cage will be big enough for them now, but when they get older, you will definitely have to get something larger for them.|`|OrvTG44laa	Guinea pigs are incredibly social and do best in pairs.  Getting two will definitely improve your guinea pig's health and happiness.  Get the other one.<br>  <br>  That cage is way too small, though.  Two guinea pigs need 10 square feet of space to live comfortably.  That isn't even close to the size they need.  They definitely shouldn't be kept in there, even for a month.  If money for the cage is a problem, you can easily build one for very cheap.  I don't know what they are called, but they are these flat, square grids.  You can connect them together, and they can be used to make a cage.  Then just put down a mat and some bedding.  <br>   <a href="http://www.guineapigcages.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guineapigcages.com/</a> <br>  The link above has cage size requirements and shows a picture of the grids for the cages I'm talking about.  But definitely get rid of that cage, it is way too small.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Get a bigger cage. That cage is WAY too small for two guinea pigs, even temporarily. They need space to run and play since they roam and graze in the wild. I don't feel guinea pigs need other pigs to be happy. All my guinea pigs I've kept separately and they were all perfectly happy. One even lived to be seven years old. They would basically be sitting side by side the entire time they were in that cage and had no room to move. This would be better for them temporarily, it would be equivalent to them having their own cage of that size. <br>  <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3057125" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  This site has helpful information as to how much room you would need per guinea pig.

I think it was like $26.49.|`|juyA6HUJaa	Guinea pigs are better in pairs but that cage you have isn't even big enough for 1 guinea pig nevermind two, which could cause them to fight a lot. Look into getting a C&c cage before you get the other one, plus if you don't get the other in the next day at most... they will have forgotten each other and you will have to re introduce.|`|5SN8R3GEaa	you have to get another guinea pig, they get very lonely if they're alone<br>  your cage size should be fine while they're small, but get a bigger cage in about a month|`|D75FlRukaa	Ye that cage is fine temporarly.. go get the other guinea pig so its not lonley.

w8v7AhOBaa	Ok, is your gecko on sand substrate and under 6" long? because impaction is quite tipical at that size and substrate.  Next, check the temp in the tank, if its 2 low during the day and night, then they will have issues with digestion.  Most important, is do not feed them nething that is larger then the size of their heads, due to the fact that it can cause them to become constipated.|`|WyMd0zlqaa	The temps in his tank might not be hot enough. It needs to be about 90* on the hot side. When I first got mine, I the pet store told me it only had to be 80*. My leo didn't poop for 5 days, and then I discovered that the tank needed to be hotter. Get an under tank heater, and a red heat bulb that's about 50 or 75 watts. I use a 75 watt. He poops every day now that it's hot enough in there. lol!<br>  In the meantime, try dipping his food in some olive oil and give put him in some warm (not hot) water. Make sure it's shallow enough for him to walk in though.|`|TmEoTapDaa	Depends how long it has been. Give it 2 drops of olive oil in the mouth.|`|tgROmqffaa	good thing that you are aware.  Put him in the tub with lukewarm water that goes up to the bottom of his neck.  The water will help losen him up and result in a clean up on your part.

TUFoB5RMaa	Approximately 6 - 8 or more!! When the female hamster gives birth, it is very important not to touch the nest or babies and avoid cleaning the cage for the first 3 weeks or else the female hamster could panic and kill the hamster babies. If it is really necessary to 'clean' a cage area while the mother hamster is nursing her babies, you should only use a small piece of tissue to 'clean' the cage but avoid touching the nest area. Provide additional bread soaked in milk in a small food bowl as this will provided extra proteins both for the mother and baby hamsters. The cage should be placed in a quiet room and out of noises since noises can cause the mother hamster stress. The babies can be separated from the mother hamster when they are 4 weeks old since at that age they are sexually mature.|`|GMvzUYbSaa	Well they can have up to 20. But the average would be around 7. But of course the mom may eat them. The reasons the mom would eat them is either if you touch them or disturb the mom. YOU don't take care of the hamsters. You shouldn't even look at them too much. The mom takes care of them. And she wont eat them if you do everything right. You only need to take care of the pregnant mommy. Don't hold her too much, don't even look at  her too much, either. Just go into her cage to give her food. The most important thing is to not touch or get your scent on them<br>  <br>  It's pretty simple. But I didn't tell you everything check out some websites and make sure the hamsters have homes! :)|`|lRcPouCbaa	They can have up to 20 but most of them time between 10-12 is a normal sized litter, best to leave them alone for about 2 week til their eyes open then after that you can handle them.

boOi7xJJaa	There is a lot to know before breeding your hamsters.  You will want to do some research and really think it through. <br>  Here is a link about sexing hamsters.

There is an odd combination of great risk to your pets and some rewards when it works. You really want to think about it.|`|Hdip83cTaa	Give them an alcsetzler tablet to nibble on if there in heat they will make aqeaky sounds after eating. But only a few tablets.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	Usually someone breeding small animals out of their home doesn't end well. Pet stores (like Pet Smart) have specific breeders they buy from and don't purchase from anyone else. Other local places or smaller companies have only certain numbers they can purchase and they order from breeders. I've seen many cases where the "excess" animals end up being snake food. And the average hamster litter is 8-10 babies and you could easily become overwhelmed with constantly breeding hamsters. So please reconsider breeding.

It is not okay to feed them paper as their diet, but if they accidentally got some, that's okay.
OrvTG44laa	When you bought them, were they in the same the cage at the store?  Are they both males?  If so, this is your reason.  Males, unless littermates, will fight each other if they share a cage.  <br>  If they are littermates though, or aren't both males, they might be playing.  But if you are sure that it is fighting it is best to just separate them before one of them ends up getting killed.|`|JNnSMh64aa	Are they male? Even male mice will fight from time to time. Also, is there a competition for food? Make sure they get plenty of food.|`|7SyCZnM9aa	What genders are they? If they are both male they will fight no matter what.

90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	This is why the state should have never messed with it's permitting process. Used to be you had to have 1000 hours documented experience to get that permit, and after you had gotten that experience, you'd most likely know where to get one. Sorry. Do your own looking around, and consider the long-term... what are you going to do with it when you can no longer keep it? I'm just not going to get into this right now... maybe I'll edit later if I'm feeling more cooperative, but I've already been through inexperienced alligator owner answering today...<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't expect them to be cheap, true, there are more expensive reptiles, but it's not like you're gonna pick one up for $25 or something stupid like that.|`|8i90ov0Gaa	<a href="http://gherp.com" rel="nofollow">http://gherp.com</a>|`|5HsbzThwaa	Go alligatoring.|`|nSIMwm9zaa	try by a swamp or there delars like dogs
n5VnN73raa	A molly and a goldfish cannot be in a tank together. A molly is a tropical fish that needs to be kept in a tank that is around 75-78 degrees, while a goldfish is a cold water fish that needs to be kept in water around 68-72 degree. <br>  <br>  Also orandas are the largest and fastest growing goldfish, the tank is already overstocked it needs to have at least 10 gallons to itself.|`|7erjLpuWaa	I would be more scared of ammonia poisoing than anything.  Basically, your tank is too small for either of your fish, much less for both. Your Oranda needs about 30 extra gallons of water.  Not to mention that your MOllys and goldfish don't thrive at the same temp. .
2Z7u3Fksaa	When ball pythons shed, they usually look dry and milky<br>  Do not try feeding him while he is shedding, ball pythons like to be left alone during the shedding process<br>  also another way to help along the shedding process is a bath<br>  Fill your bath tub up only enough to cover his body but not his head with luke warm water and let him swim around<br>  When you take him out put him in a towel and cover him up...not too tight<br>  let him squeeze his way out<br>  The next time you should feed him is the day after he is done shedding<br>  He will get milky caps on his eyes and when those disappear about 72 hours later he will start shedding<br>  the next day when all of his skin is off, you can feed him<br>  I hope this helped|`|niztxto9aa	They are supposed to look as you described. Crunchy, saggy skin, milky blue eyes...etc. Shedding is a stressful time for any snake so hiding is normal. It's also due to it being a ball python in the first place. They are natural hiders. When his eyes clear up you know that he is close to the actual shed. I usually don't recommend trying to feed while in shed. Shedding works up a nice appetite but takes a lot of them at the same time. So you can try feeding after a couple hours when he's done. In terms of the actual shed, bp's don't shed full pieces. They have odd scales that don't allow them to do so. So let the snake work off all it's going to on its own then soak him in a tub filled with luke warm/room temp water for about 10 minutes. After he's nice and moist take a rag and slide it down his body. The excess shed will come right off with ease.|`|ENVJAX6caa	soak him in water for about roughly 6 to 8 hours, it will help the shedding process go faster and when snakes shed they like to be left alone so dont handle him or try to peel of the skin yourself. You could damage his scales.
H06PtiIAaa	enough said....<br>  <br>  common pleco gets about 26 inches byfar too large for a 10 gallon, there is no shark that fits in a 10 gallon, bala sharks for example need at least 125 gallons as they get about 14 inches ea.<br>  <br>  7 tiger barbs at least 29 gallons.<br>  <br>  <br>  DO NOT STOCK BASED ON THE SIZE FISH ARE NOW.... IT IS BASED ON HOW LARGE THE FISH CAN BE|`|29Um8OCvaa	Are you serious? Or are you just trying to get attention!?<br>  <br>  You could only fit all of those in a 100 gallon!|`|QxJVD1Flaa	Yes, too many fish. Pleco itself grows quite large. You can have 7 tigers all on their own. I would reccomend upgrading to a much bigger aquarium, like a 55 gallon.|`|FIRIiz3Zaa	Yes you do have an over crowded tank I would sell some or give some back for a refund or upgrade to a bigger tank.
Si3N2X90aa	If your fish tank has lights in the hood, this will help raise the water temperature. If it does not, you could even point a desk lamp at it.<br>  <br>  Even though sunlight does cause algae to bloom, the temperature of the water is more important. If you have goldfish, they prefer cooler, room temp. water. Tropical fish however, such as Platies, Barbs, Danios, Glofish, Guppies etc. prefer 74 to 80 degrees. <br>  <br>  Heaters are not very expensive. Talk to whoever is saying you can not have one and explain that the fish need it. They have a very long life, are fairly inexpensive and don't use much electricity. Most heaters have an automatic shut off, and you can set the temperature to your desired level. The heater will turn off and on as needed. You just need to make sure that the heater is submerged to the water level marked on the heater.|`|I4BimUCwaa	Warm the space where the fish tank is? Like warm your room up? If you place your fish tank near a window with constant light this will help warm the tank also, <br>  <br>  Good Luck   <br>  <br>  <br>  my recommendation is to get a heater for your tank there is many different types available|`|W5W29lP5aa	if you can raise the rooms temperture water works real slow so if your room is 82 degree thans it's 77 degree in your tank NEVER put it near a window sun light mean algae|`|Ti9tKWigaa	Hot water?|`|Pw1y449Daa	1.

oUTb1zNkaa	You have to entice him. Give the mouse a little jiggle to get the snakes attention. Or try dipping it in some warm chicken broth.  Or you may have to brain the mouse (expose a piece of its brain to entice the snake.)<br>  And you DO NOT have to feed him in a separate container. This is one of the biggest beginner myths when it comes to keeping reptiles, and one of the worst pieces of advice ppl give. Use tongs and common sense.|`|KM5MNRJmaa	ball pythons are pretty picky eaters! sometimes mine won't seem interested, but if i warm it up more (use a blow dryer) she'll snatch it! just make sure the mouse is nice and warm and move it around a bit. (use tongs or something so you don't get accidentally bitten)<br>  <br>  if it still isn't interested, just try again in a couple days|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	Ball Pythons only eat when everything is right<br>  You cannot feed them in their habitat (i feed mine in a critter cage)<br>  It has to be warm<br>  It has to  be at night with the nocturnal light<br>  They will not eat if their environment is changed or if their stressed out<br>  and also they will not eat is they are about to shed<br>  Its nothing to worry to much about<br>  wait three days and try again, if hes not shedding that is|`|7k5EC2Tcaa	Definately make sure it is warm enough. Encountered a problem before where mine would not eat for about a month or so, but he went straight for a live one if you would be interested in trying that. Also, when mine was younger he would be very picky..now that he is older, he eats willingly every time. good luck.
6j9EZXGWaa	Here are some choices for ball python bedding: cypress bed, fir bark, orchid bark, repti-bark. Place a piece of reptile friendly wood in his tank when he is about to shed so he can rub up against it. He is burrowing around his water bowl because his tank may be too dry He is reaching for humidity. Get a hygrometer to measure the humidity level in his tank and keep the level at 50-60% regularly and up it to 70-80% when he is about to shed. This can be done by misting the tank with WARM water and covering the screen top 3/4 of the way. Remember, your ball python is a tropical-sub tropical snake and that is the environment you are trying to replicate in his tank.|`|KM5MNRJmaa	i line the bottom of the terrarium with newspaper just so its easier to clean, less scrubbing. but i cover it with aspen bed, because like you said, they like to burrow!  other good choices are coconut bark, cyprus bed, and desert snow. just make sure you change it often, like once a week, or right after shedding. maybe you can get a rough stone or something for him to rub against too. but i don't think using just newspaper alone is a real good idea...<br>  <br>  also, when i notice my snake starting to show signs of shedding, i'll keep a spray bottle near her tank and give her a light misting a couple times a day. try a bath too! it helps! he'll dart around the tub faster than you've probably seen him move!  lol|`|lT3Aqt1Caa	if hes having trouble shedding try using shed-aid and giving him a luke warm bath for about half an hour to an hour. if you see the skin coming off its ok to gently rub it in the direction of the scales but dot pull it off. also try raising the humidity in the tank. as for substrate try dirt instead, it hold humidity better. there are also sprays that help control mites.|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	Use newspaper as a base<br>  on top of the news paper instead of the aspen bedding, use potting soil<br>  its heavy so he cannot burrow in it and dig underneath his water bowl<br>  also scatter some moss around his hide spot<br>  My python loves that|`|P0FKlVRGaa	u should keep it with aspen i have an albino corn snake that loves it|`|ptKp7mBJaa	The main reason you are having shedding issues is because Ball pythons are tropical snakes which need higher humidity and aspen bedding tends not to retain moisture well. You can spray water onto the wood to make it more moist but you have to be careful to watch for mold and you have to change it more often. If you want to stick with aspen then I suggest adding a shedding box which you would put into the tank when your snake is getting ready to shed. <br>  <br>  Shedding boxes are easy to make. You can use a sandwich box, sterilite container, rubbermaid, etc. of appropriate size for your snake. Get something that your snake can easily coil in but is not too big, snakes tend to like tighter squeezes, it makes them feel safer. Cut a hole in one side big enough for your snake to fit through but again not too big because you don't want the humidity to escape. Then inside the box put a damp towel, paper towel, Eco earth, damp terrarium moss, or just some wet aspen and change it every day or so.<br>  <br>  What I've found works best is making sure the bedding is damp the day before they shed. When their skin turns clear about a week after they blue out then I know they will be shedding in the next 12-48 hours. I will either pour some water onto the bedding (I use newspaper, it's free and easy to clean) and put in a wet paper towel for traction and they will shed just fine. For snakes I know don't shed too well I will put them in a sterilite container with a wet paper towel over night.
YtBzRAxMaa	More Hay. <br>   4 flakes a day is not enough for maintenance let alone growth. 730 pounds is a real low weight for a horse at 2. <br>   Feed your horse based on the weight of the forage (hay) not on the width of the flakes (slivers/leaf). 10 -15% of her body weight should be what you are feeding her in hay as she grows - which she will continue to do for at least another year or 3.<br>   So 8 to 10 pounds of hay per day - you are feeding less than half that.<br>   Youngsters here get free choice hay available 24/7 - none are "fat" as growing horses will rarely get fat from hay.<br>   Put a bale (yes a whole bale) in a hay net and see how much is eaten over night - I'll bet most is eaten - I'll also bet that in a few weeks of proper hay feeding you will see her have a growth spurt.<br>   She needs a growth oriented pelleted grain fed once or twice a day. This provides the vitamins she needs.<br>   Dieting a baby is not good and she will be better able to gain muscle if she has enough hay to GROW on.<br>   I'd also slow down on the work load if you are working her in a circle an hour a day. I'd go with every second day - untill her weight improves or 20 mins to 1/2 an hour every day.<br>  Is she an Arab type? Even then 730 is about 75 to 100 pounds too light. <br>  What is her height?|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi do you feed her any grain?  She needs to be grained every day especially if she is in training now.  Purina makes some excellent grain feeds for horses and for the different stages and ages.  Is she a pony?  730 pounds seems small for a 2 year old.  Is she thin at all?  Have you wormed her?  Be sure to not push her too hard on her legs if she's just two.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	i wouldn't go any farher if shes two and ya she needs grain but i usually dont suggest riding till they r 3 1/2 because it can cause so many physical problems|`|AA11570905	I would make sure she has plenty of roughage.  Alfalfa provides plenty of nutrition but that is not all a horse needs for optimum health.  A horses digestive system is designed to work continuously so provide plenty of good quality grass hay in addition to the alfalfa.  I gave my young horse a scoop of Strategy pellets am and pm as well.   I wouldn't be working her under saddle at all yet, let alone cantering.  I know that a horses skeletal system is no where near mature enough at two to go into training.  I prefer to start saddle training at 3 coming 4.  Here is a very informative article that every one who deals with young horses should read:<br>  <a href="http://www.equinestudies.org/ranger_2008/ranger_piece_2008_pdf1.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.equinestudies.org/ranger_2008...</a>|`|0474910698a964873e0ea0d9f3879256aa	First off what kind of horse do you have and what you plan on using her for?<br>  A performance horse would need more than a regular pleasure riding horse. It also depends on how many times a week she gets ride time and what her workout/training regiment is.<br>  <br>  I have an Arabian colt which gets Omelene 300 along with Grow Colt, a vitamin/mineral supplement, probiotics, and good coastal hay. Plus a mineral and salt block in pasture. He hates anything with alfalfa in it.<br>  Along with fresh water everyday no matter how much water is still left in the waterer, it gets dumped out and replaced. Freshwater is a must in growing horses.|`|2bde4413eb2d92e3071651631a2d58e5aa	This might sound like ducking the question... but have you asked your vet for advice?  A two-year-old should be able to handle a little grain, but vets are trained to know these things--and they tend to know the horses they treat regularly.  Best to be safe than sorry...<br>  <br>  My horse is a 9-year-old QHxConnemara cross; he gets hay of course, and two scoops of feed each day, and of course plenty of water and a mineral lick.  :)  But he's at his full growth, and is worked daily under saddle.  Your mileage, with a youngster, may vary.  What breed is she?<br>  <br>  In any case, good luck--and I really suggest you speak with your vet for the very best of advice.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The last thing you want to do is put extra weight on a two year old, which can damage her growing legs.  I hope you are not riding her yet, as she is too young.  It would be best to talk to your vet about what to feed her to assure she gets the right nutrients without putting excess weight on her.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I would not be riding a two year old at all..it is doubtful her knees/plates have closed.  She can be severely lamed at this time in her life. Also if you feed too high of protein, it can mess up her bones and growth. I would not be riding her at all!!! <br>  As for feed, don't depend on the size of a flake.  Your hay and grain need weighed. And if you are feeding a high protein alfalfa, she probably does not need any grain. 21 percent is pretty high, which is about the average for good alfalfa.<br>  Wait til she is at least 3 full years old to ride.  I know some do.cause they just gotta be in the futurities and get that money, but it is at the cost of their horses!

Her muscle will be more developed but it really depends on the horse and how fast they mature. Usually you can bet a colt will mature faster than a filly.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	What you need to do is talk to the owner about what they are expecting you to do with the horse and what they want accomplished.<br>  And then decide accordingly.

V7AAba8Laa	They are wattles, which are just a genetic leftover in some goat's DNA.  They don't really serve any purpose and can show up on different areas of their body - including necks, udders and even by the testes.  They're just there and don't do anything.<br>  <br>  We have Nubians and pygmies, and a couple of my pygmies have wattles on their necks.  Genetically, the one doe with wattles produces offspring that have wattles as well about 50% of the time. <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question!|`|cqLYkuz8aa	They are called wattles.

I would think that if she isn't in any kind of discomfort or pain, and isn't bleeding then waiting until the morning to see the vet would be ok.  do you have an e-collar for her?  if so put it on her so she leaves the incision alone.  usually there are two sets of stitches - one inside and one outside.  keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn't lick her incision.

Part of it is genetics & breeding & being from a mill where they have no regard for faults like bad teeth alignment. She need to have a vet look at them to be sure.  They may just need a cleaning & scraping.  She needs to get him more things to chew on like raw bones or give dental treats/bones for teeth cleanings. Plus learning the proper way to brush his teeth which the vet can show her is very important.  The vet will be able to give more info since they will be examining the dog in person.
g6zbKojDaa	Hi Ashley,<br>  I think if you changed the water it'll be fine.<br>  Aquarium thermometers don't contain mercury. If yours had a red liquid, it wasn't mercury. Mercury is silver colored.<br>  There may be bits of broken glass somewhere in the tank so be careful.<br>  I use the plastic LCD stick-on thermometers...they stay in place and don't break. (o:<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  David|`|azDWmNxcaa	If its a marine thermometer it not mercury, its just red alcohol, remove most of the water and clean the gravel, make sure u use chlorinated water so your cycle is effected.
8owlj2xHaa	Your tank is way to small to handle even the clean up crew that Rohn the wrong recommended. It would be overstocked with just cleaners. <br>  You are the best cleaner for your tank.  But if you insist go with a few small snails a couple cerith and a couple of nassarius.  You can not put crabs and snails together, the crabs will kill the snails, some say for their shells, but they are omnivores and will eat snails also.|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	Get about 6 or 7 blue leg hermit crabs, around 12 turbo or astrea snails.

Allow the tank to establish itself for at least 8 months. during this time you need to learn about saltwater and all about reef tanks.<br>  <br>  You want to start with about 75-125 gallon tank with live sand and live rock around 1 pound per gallon. Set up the tank with all of the equipment like the filter and the  protein skimmer. allow everything to run for 2-4 weeks until the tank is done cycleing.<br>  <br>  Then you can start adding fish.<br>  <br>  it is 100% important to start with a large tank. 97% of beginners want a reef tank or saltwater and they want a small tank like a 10 gallon, 96% of them fail due to because they dont realize the smaller you go, the more of an expert you need to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  The problem with corals and reefs is you will need alot of money for stuff. a lighting system is easily 200-500 dollars at least. power compacts will limit you on corals, but it is the cheapest. then you have T5 and Metal halide lighting which are best but more expensive.<br>  <br>  Then you need to learn about supplements like calicum, magnisum, strontium, iodine, and carbonate for starters. you will need to learn about them and test for them as well as add these supplements on a weekly bases.<br>  <br>  There is alot of work that goes into a coral reef tank.|`|azDWmNxcaa	Start with a heap of money, and a big enough tank as small tanks are hard to keep stable...

yTjOTVTfaa	I'm sorry about your hamster. What I do is leave a little hand full of hamster food where your hamster is hiding. Try to leave the food far enough away from the hole so when the hamster eats it so she would have to come out far enough so you can grab her. But make sure the food is close enough to the hole so she is able to smell the food. I recommend you do this at night, or when ever your hamster is most active, because if she sleeping in the hole, she won't realize that there is food. You can also try to stick a piece of a carrot in the hole and try to lure her out of there. (I tiny piece of a carrot) Good Luck! I hope you get your hamster back! <br>  BTW-I have a hamster too, and I named him Oreo! :D|`|zZVpj4Ftaa	Cheese..<br>  !!!|`|qo2u1BCoaa	you might turn out the lights. darken the area. your hamster will come out.especially if there is food.|`|EW7mVhlRaa	Calm down,<br>  Just like you did earlier,<br>  You tried luring the mom hamster with a french fry and it kind of worked,<br>  So, try putting a cloth on where she is, and put some food there, and when she comes out far enough and she is eating just quietly grab her(gently) and there!

And their cage was in a room of the big stable complex my parents have and i was pretty sure i wouldn't see them again. But i left the door of their cage open and kept putting clean fresh food in their and about 10 days later the whole mouse family were all home safely!! I could hardly beleive it!! Oh yea and it was quite strange cause the mother mouse had lost her tail somehow and we changed her name to hamster :) good luck!!|`|hK5qzoAVaa	What you should do is go to a pet store or search online for a store that has a Rodent Trap. <br>  These traps are completely safe. All you do is put Little food inside the trap and when the rodent goes inside and touches the food the trap door shuts.<br>  What you should do is put the trap in front of where you believe the hamster to be.|`|74fd94be95e8f69470358249a9e5c950aa	when i was young i put food in a box like a ritz box infront of the hole with hamester food.when it jumped out the hole it fell in the box with the food.Try it good luck!!!!!!
5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	Some horses may know how to lunge because lungeing is an important part of a horse's training when they are younger-too young to be saddled. <br>  But its not  there instinct to run around on a lunge. so you may have a little trouble here. Its would be eaiter to have a round pen, but its not a huge deal if you don't, just keep your lunge a little bit shorter. Bring the whip out with you, but DO NOT use it unless you need it. <br>  I would start by standing next to your horse and hold the lunge as tight as you would if you where leading her out. the turn your your body is parellel to her body, and swing the rest of the rest of the lunge towards her hindquarters using viouce comands "Walk On"<br>  (remember your standing right next to her and you don't need to swing it very hard. she sould start walking around you, but make sure you stay where u are, and ask him to keep going. This way she'll get the idea that when you swing the lunge and ask with your voice it means walk on, keep doing this and slowly give her more and more lunge line. untill you have a small circle. i would sugest you keep it at a walk for the first time untill you've done this enough where you are both comfortable.|`|5750c8ed6e36c08baa63c0651369908eaa	There's a great article on Liverystable.net's home page right now about Training Your Horse To Lunge.

Personally I like to free lunge a horse before I lunge line them, and try to establish join up. After that just take it slow on the line practice walking outward, stopping, and switching directions before you move up speeds. If you need you can start really close, 10 feet so you have more contact and work your way out|`|AnX8QHgHaa	I'm guessing since your mare is 10 that you probably were not the one who started her and chances are lunging was a part of her early training.<br>  <br>  Put her on the lunge in the smaller enclosed pen that you have, see what she knows/remembers and go from there.|`|jVBz3Bupaa	Some horses don't get the concept right away and some never will. usually horses get it right off. all you need to do is...<br>  1. act like your going 2 lunge normally as if your horse knows it. if she does... GREAT!!<br>  2. (only if your horse doesnt know) hav some1 walk your horse around the perimeater as if your horse was being lunged. (you r acting like ur normally lunging)<br>  3. c if ur horse will walk the perimeater without the person walking her around.<br>  4. then go 2 a trot without some1 walking her. if she doesnt get it still hav the person trot around with her. then go to a lope.<br>  <br>  <br>  i put up barrels in every spot my horse tried 2 cut the corner so she would hav 2 go around it. hope this helps!!|`|peDwXmQJaa	she will probobly know how to already

I would get a different cage. The hamster won't get very much bigger from the time they're babies till they are adults. One inch is very easy for a hamster to effortlessly squeeze through.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	My friend had a pet rat who was able to squeeze through the bars in a cage like that so I am assuming that a hamster can as well. Why not keep the adult in an aquarium as well? They are easily cleaned and safer than barred cages that can be chewed. If you really want a barred cage then consider reinforcing the space with a mesh or wire screening. This also may pose a chew problem so be selective.

AM7CgQ4daa	the best breeders wait for 2 years, since it takes that long for a dog to mature both physically and mentally.   Before breeding, the dog needs to have its nature assessed for good temperament, and needs all the health checks done for the known physical faults (vet test) and for conformation faults.    This is why a dog must be properly mature, and still not growing.<br>  <br>  Just a point to ponder,   with the recession coming, the market for puppies may be affected, make sure you have a waiting list before breeding as it would be heartbreaking to have to give them to substandard owners or give them to dog refuge homes.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	He needs to be at least after he has been x-rayed for hips(which is at 2yr) & other testing done on both dogs before breeding.  He is still a teen & not an adult til 2yr.  Just because  you & your family has 2 registered dogs is not a good enough reason to breed.  There are many boxers available right now.|`|X7i59NeIaa	It is best to wait until they are at least 18 months to 2 years because they will produce stronger healthier pups.|`|bJh1MesQaa	Well I'm glad at least you are going to make pure bred puppies.

Good Luck!|`|Bw18seFqaa	must be at least 2..  genetic health tests are not valid until the age of 2.<br>  <br>  Besides health tests thru the OFA, CERF, BAER, Optigen and PennHip, both dogs also need their CH titles and a brucellosis test.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Then dont ask and breed the underage dog. <br>  <br>  Min is two years. <br>  If they are registered, what championships have been won, tittles, working anything?<br>  Any health testing been done in her boxer. (Yours is too young to breed)<br>  Any genetic testing?<br>  What about breed specific testing?<br>  Got a mentor that knows what you will go through and when to get to a vet?<br>  Got 5 grand for a possible c-section or pregnancy/birth gone wrong?<br>  <br>  Please consider the time and money reputable breeders put into the dogs they produce. It is not a whim decision of my aunt wants to breed her boxer or my friend thinks my dog is cute and wants a puppy but cant afford one from the shelter. (not saying that is you, but you should be asking your mentor not YA) and to note: your male may not complement the females characteristics. Just like you would avoid mating a light golden to another light golden or a dark golden to another dark golden. You want to fit in with he standard and if you produce a too light or too dark color, the pups will be pet quality only. <br>  What will be done with the puppies?<br>  What contract will they be sold on?<br>  What resources do you have to enforce that contract?<br>  Are you planing on selling limited registration or full registration? How will you know if the dog you chose to breed next generation will produce quality pups. <br>  <br>  If you want to breed, make sure your dog is full registration, AKC or reputable registry registered, and get into conformation or working. And once your dog gets some tittles/championships, you will start to see others offering you breeding opportunities. Thats when you consider health testing and genetic testing to see if your dog passes. <br>  100% healthy when breeding a dog to better the breed is not a vet visit stating he looks good, it is so much more. <br>  <br>  If pups dont sell, what do you plan to do with them? If you dont keep them you are not helping anyone but your aunts wants, not the reality. I dont want to have to clean up a mess. <br>  What do you feed too? Breeders should know about diets for dogs and have a good diet, not purina, iams, or science diet crap. <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com</a>|`|fTQmn5V3aa	Just because they are "registered" doesn't mean they are suitable for breeding with each other. How far back have you cleared their respective genetic histories? You should go back AT LEAST four generations, further if possible, on both sides. What dominant or recessives are they carrying? Have you checked for corneal dystrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial septal defect, progressive retinal atrophy, and the host of other problems that boxers are notorious for having? <br>  <br>  If you haven't done your research, then don't breed. The one and only reason to breed is to improve the breed. It sounds like you (or your aunt) is only after the money.|`|wUg7iYU1aa	IDIOT...did you listen to that? because that is what you are, why ask questions and then not listen to good advice. Do not breed, if you do not know the basics, then you are not ready, why bring more pups in this world that will more than likely be killed in shelters. Has both dogs been health tested, hips eyes etc. have they earned any titles? You know nothing about breeding so have your dog neutered, and tell your aunt to grow up and quit trying to make money off of her dog.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	The AKC (American Kennel Club) recognizes studs at the age of 7 months.  I'm not an expert with Boxers, but I do raise champion line large breed hounds.  With the larger breeds, sometimes the males can't actually mate until they're older.  But in my opinion, if he can do the deed, to go ahead and let him.

Makes me sick.|`|d04x3IaWaa	Well, do a TON of research... just because you have registered dogs doesn't mean they should breed.<br>  <br>  I breed working German Shepherds.  I absolutely WILL NOT look at a male until he's at least 3 years old.  Look at it like is like a 14 year old getting a girl pregnant... it just isn't right.  Another reason I don't even consider a male under 3 is because even if they look fine, most males testicles are fully developed until around 3.  Also, I want to see what the temperament of the dog is, not what the activity level of a puppy is.  I know how puppies are.  Boxers also tend to stay in the puppy stage for longer, making it harder to tell the personality of the male. I also refuse to breed my females to a dog who doesn't have EXCELLENT OFA ratings.  I'm iffy about good... I want excellent. <br>  <br>  If you're going to breed, get his OFA checks done for hips and elbows and make sure your aunt knows the cost of breeding Boxers.  Prelims can be done, but the actual check isn't done until 2.  This is you getting numerous xrays of his hips and elbows and then sending them to get checked. <br>  <br>  You need to do a TON of research about breeding... then do some more until you can give me a few facts that I don't know about breeding... you'll just be being unsafe and producing low quality puppies, AKC papers mean nothing if the breeding of the parents doesn't 100% BETTER the breed standard.|`|5yhitoY0aa	It is up to you whether to listen to the advise or not.It is better to bread after 2 that will be the best time for healthy breeding.

9kceDOTraa	You got some nice input from most of your answers, there is just some low life and low self esteemed person who hates people smarter then they are downing everyone, yet, while your last few answers had greater value then the first couple, no one said anything incorrect.<br>  <br>  You want to know your species even more then the location, as that you know the species, you get the location at the same time if you study them.  One GENERAL and I say in general because in this hobby, there are alway some exceptions, Africans that come from the major rift lakes, Malawi, Tangyangika and Victoria, come from waters that are very alkaline and high in pH.  Not all Africans come from just these lakes though.  There are some riverine types, as well as Madagascar, and the waters in these locations are slightly different.<br>  <br>  Now you will get some newer as well as older hobbyists that swear this doesn't mean as much as we make it out to be, but it is with common sense.  Even though many people buy stock of tank kept species, and not wild caught, the species itself has spent 10,000 plus years evolving in these types of waters, and evolutionary change doesn't occur in just 1 generation removed from that habitat.  You should strive to keep them in conditions as close to the natural habitat as you can.<br>  <br>  Now South, Central, and even the few North American types, generally have evolved from waters more softer and acidic then the African general waters, though it is worth saying, many Central American natural habitats are VERY similar and close to that of Rift Lakes in Africa.  However, across the board, many SA and CA types, and all the NA's (which I think only the Texas Cichlid is the only NA, just not sure) get significantly larger and display aggression, as well as breed in quite a different way then Africans.  Usually, when young, you might have some level of success mixing the groups, but when full grown, the Africans won't have much of a chance.  They could either be swallowed whole by something like an Oscar, Jack Demspey, Green Terror or Jaguar cichlid, or just literally beaten to death.  <br>  <br>  Dietary needs are often quite different as well as spawning techniques matter.  I can tell you from primarily keeping mouthbrooding Africans, that these do NOT mix very well at all with the substrate spawning types.  I have a few Madagascar species that do this, and it's also worth noting, these Africans have many close similarities to that of South American substrate spawning.  Both mom and dad watch over a brood closely and drive off ANY fish of any size that comes near it.  This poses a big problem when you try to mix in mouthbrooders that dwell mostly in the substrate area.<br>  <br>  These are just a few of the reasons why it's important to know the species you are getting, long before you get them, and as well, make sure your tank is cycled out first.  It's not going to kill you one bit to read read read and read again over all the sites to get a greater understanding of proper keeping.

There are river cichlids that are still african(like jewels). their water is different from the lakes. <br>  <br>  <br>  none are "worse". some are more complicated to keep than others.

Smaller aquariums will cause aggression, poisoning, and stunted growth.<br>  <br>  You need to move your koi into the pond asap. They are pond fish and should achieve at least two feet in length. I would not classify a four inch koi as "big" He is under two years of age, and still very small. A six inch koi can be estimated to be about two years old. After two years their growth will slow down.

rdcxVqfxaa	You will need to purchase another cage for the new bird. Put him in the new cage, and let him get used to that environment for a week or two. Don't put the cages right up against each other, as they may start fighting. I'd leave them a few feet apart if you can so they can see each other and get used to the other bird's presence. While they are living alone, take them out separately everyday for play time. Do this for a few days, and then start letting them play together. Once they get to know each other a little better, you could put the new bird in the older bird's cage for a few hours. Just let them hang out and get to know one another better. Do this for a few days, then let the new bird have a sleepover, meaning let him stay with the other bird all night. If it goes over well, then you could continue doing this. If they get along pretty well but start fighting later on, do it about every other night for a few days. After this process, they should be fine together. I'm not sure how you tried to introduce them before, but you may have just frightened the older bird a little. Another bird invaded his territory and he may not have understood why, which may have confused him. Are they the same sex or male and female? If they are male and female they may pick and fight a little on occasion, but it shouldn't be a problem. If they start injuring each other, separate them immediately. Hope this helps, and good luck.|`|Z9kCzIkyaa	id suggest buying a cockatiel taming book from our pet store.. buy another cage and put it next to the older birds cage

1i8HiHHeaa	when i looked for my puppy i knew i wanted to find the 'right' dog as opposed to 'a' dog which it sounds like you are doing. this is a commitment to a life you will be responsible for for a long time to come. <br>  <br>  from the website it appears that these people are responsible breeders & seem committed to the betterment of the breed. they offer health checks, guarantees & their dogs are well proven in many arenas: conformation, hunting & dog sports. their dogs are also well socialized which is very important. <br>  <br>  i would try to establish as much of a relationship as is possible with the breeders - you should be able to ask them anything! remember there are no stupid questions & i'm sure they will respect you for your inquiries. (the breeder i got my dog from has been a huge help & a wealth of information over the last three years.) they should be ready, willing & able to help you in any way. after all they've made a huge investment in their dogs & want only the best for the pups they've brought into this world. <br>  <br>  a good breeder will also want to know everything possible about you & the home you will provide. describe your situation, ask their advice & beliefs about everything: training, feeding, development, socialization & show handling are just a few of the things you should discuss. find out if they are willing to mentor you if they are close by or can recommend someone to do so in your area. <br>  <br>  i never intended to show my girl in conformation but it was encouraged by the breeder for my particular dog. it has been both frustrating & rewarding. be prepared - it's not easy! even with a dog meeting the standard you will not win every time. it can also be very expensive: entry fees, travel expenses, equipment, time & energy all take its toll. you should be eager to learn as much as possible about it before you start: read some good books, go to dog shows & talk to people, study the breed standard & continue to ask questions through out the process. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Chxoncy7aa	I would start going to shows before you choose the breeder.  You are going to meet a lot of people at the shows, and you may very well change your mind.  Ask a lot of questions, watch how the dogs do, then make a decision.  You are more likely to be sure you have a good breeder with quality dogs this way.  Good luck.  BTW, Agility is very addicting!|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	Many breeders who have quality pups will keep track of how the pups do in their new homes. Find out if this line of dogs is good for the activities you are interested in. Also make sure that you learn what type of inherited diseases Vislas are prone to.  Then make sure the breeding dogs are checked to prevent passing any inherited problems on to the pups. I think that genetic testing of breeding stock is what separates hobby breeders with serious breeders. <br>  <br>  If you are able to go to many shows. meet the dogs and see which ones seem best to you. Meet lots of breeders and see their dogs.  It is good to take your time.  Vislas are lovely dogs.

Asking the same Q over untill you get a answer you WANT to hear doesnt make your stocking choices OK......<br>  <br>  <br>  ''''I would have to agree that South Americans like the ones you have listed, would not work very well with a Front. Fronts are from lake Tangyangika and the water in Tangyangika is VERY hard and high in pH, much higher then any of the other rift lakes. The difference is close to 2 complete pH points which is 20 times more alkaline then typical South American waters. That aspect alone would make it very difficult to try to mix South Americans with any Tangyangikan.<br>  <br>  Green Terrors and Jack Dempseys are also rule the whole tank type of South Americans as well. Just to keep the stock you have now, if they are in anything under 150 gallons, that's playing with a ticking time bomb, it's just a matter of time. Throw in a pair of Oscars, and just to house that size of fish total, you're talking over 200 gallons easily. I don't see this idea working out very well.'''|`|g6zbKojDaa	Hi pollita,<br>  Yes, a 150-gallon tank is a good-sized tank for most larger fish. But I would be careful with combining aggressive cichlids that get large, as some don't care for each other and you'll have a war on your hands.<br>  If you can find a pair of larger cichlids, that may be your safest route. But even male and female pairs of large aggressive cichlids sometimes don't get along. Raising pairs of cichlids together from a younger age may help keep the peace.<br>  Discus are specialized fish and pretty much require a species tank. But you could possibly add cardinal tetras or other tetras to a discus tank. Just make sure the discus aren't hungry. (o:<br>  <br>  Happy fishkeeping,<br>  David|`|w23w2pZ8aa	A 150 gallon tank is a good size but its still not enough for all the fishes u have chosen. This tank should just about be enough for your oscars n the dempsey. If u don't wish to remove any of your fishes then its OK but definitely don't add any more. Oscars are a lovely fish to keep but ply be sure to provide them with a good filtration and water quality.

wUg7iYU1aa	I do not understand hating an entire breed for ANY reason...So dogs bite...thats what happens..no need to take it out on an entire breed because of 1 dog.

My dog wouldn't hurt a fly.... so yes i agree with you.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	You can't be racist towards dogs.<br>  Main Entry:    rac·ism<br>    1  : a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race<br>  Note the clear usage of the word "human."<br>  <br>  People absolutely should judge breeds. It's necessary in order to choose the best match for your lifestyle. You must consider the dog's prey drive, grooming requirements, exercise requirements, tendency towards dog aggression, tendency toward human aggression, wariness toward strangers, size, shedding levels, responsiveness to training and more.<br>  <br>  I do agree with you, though. While people should pay attention to a breed's typical characteristics, they certainly shouldn't make hugely generalized assumptions about them. An aggressive Lab (and I assure you, they exist) does not mean that all Labs are aggressive. The same goes for Pits. (Of course, you do have to be aware that Pit Bulls do have often have a considerable prey drive and tendency toward dog aggression that must be considered. Plenty of Pits are perfectly fine toward small animals and dogs, but it's quite natural for problems to occur without the proper socialization.)|`|WIFKeDBgaa	There is a difference. Dogs for generations (ahhhh...the good old days) were bred for a specific purpose. Therefore, each breed had specific temperaments, personalities and abilities that were desireable and targetted for breeding purposes. Other than the working GSD, field trial lab, coon hounds and various cattle dogs, there isn't much "breeding for a purpose" going on any more....but the roots of the behavior are still in a majority of each individual breed. The humaniacs can cry all they want about being prejudice toward a "breed" as a whole, but once you've had your hands on 4 or 5 thousand dogs, it's actually pretty easy to "generalize" each breeds temperament, nerves, drives, etc. It's pretty clear that 99% of chows & char peis are "fear biters"...that jack Russel's are "gamey" little bastard$ that have no concept of their size and will fearlessly go after anything from a mouse to a  D9 bulldozer....white shepherds are "nerve bags", dachshunds suck at housebreaking, afghans are arrogant, stubborn & stupid, border collies are very intelligent, active and NEED a job...and dalmations are best kept in an "animated" form.<br>  This doesn't mean thay I condemn any of those breeds as a "whole", but I've done more "hands on" than any scientific study.<br>  <br>  So, I guess what I'm saying is "NO", I don't think that having an opinion on a breed has anything to do with discrimination in people.  <br>  <br>  Then again...if the people that want to own pit bulls & rotties were required to pass a "MINIMUM" IQ test, those breeds wouldn't be in the trouble they're in today. So I guess I discriminate against people that are too ignorant to own a dog.|`|91nAPOLtaa	now thats a good question. when it comes to those dog shows.

As much as i agree with you. things just dont work that way. It is a scientific fact, that pit bulls are more aggressive than other breeds, i owned a pitbull, she was the sweetest dog on the planet, i cried for days after she died, but the thing is, people are ignorant, were animals, just like monkies, gorillas, sheep, cows, and tiger, and sharks etc etc etc. Sharks and tigers get a bad rap, just because they attack humans, because they are carnivores, we then turn around and eat a cow or a pig. The world will never be peaceful, because of the ignorant people. Mainly the racists that hate for no reason and just want to go kill people who are different.

If you're unsure about her house manners, make sure all doors that lead outside are kept closed when her collar's off.<br>  <br>  My dog responds well to commands and has never shown the slightest interest in "escaping" the house. (Plus, it's pretty hard for a 156-pound dog to squeeze through a partially opened door without anyone noticing.) So, we only put his collar on if we're having guests over or if we're leaving the house. I agree, I doubt collars are very comfortable to wear all the time. They can also pose a hazard as they can be caught on anything protruding about the house or yard and choke the dog. (An uncommon occurrence, yes, but genuinely possible.) Thus, I think it's more than acceptable to remove her collar when she's safely sleeping at home.|`|ydshiNrKaa	My dogs collar is on all the time.  He doesn't mind it and it's safer especially if he should somehow get out of the house he'd have his tags and his collar on for identification purpose.

vbEkYH2haa	So sorry to hear one died :(<br>  <br>  if you get it a friend you need to still quarantine them from each other in another cage and in another room for 30 days.|`|C59bTKO2aa	Sure, parakeets are flock birds in the wild, so one bird will be lonely.|`|1omgPICKaa	So sorry to hear your bird died. :(<br>  <br>  Yes, certainly get another one. Birds are highly social and can't live a happy life without a friend (which would be either you if the bird is tame, otherwise should be another bird preferably of the same species).<br>  <br>  When a bird losses its partner, it is common for them to grieve or feel down for up to two weeks. Anymore and there may be a problem.<br>  <br>  Here are the steps you should take when introducing them:<br>  1. When you bring your new bird home, it is reccomended to quaratine the bird for a few weeks (or more) so that it doesn't give your other bird diseases.<br>  2. Put them in different cages next to each other so they can meet each other. Watch their reactions. You may keep them like this for one day to a few days.<br>  3. When you think the time is right, you can introduce the new bird to the cage. If possible, it is a good idea to rearrange the perches, toys, etc to make it look like a new cage. This way, it helps prevent your older bird getting territorial and start attacking the new one.<br>  4. Monitor them closely to make sure they are getting along.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. :)|`|yet0QXKQaa	I suggest that you do get a parakeet. too many times i've seen the surviving parakeet die of lonliness....
dLhRrTlRaa	If you contact an Irish Wolfhound rescue chances are they may have mixes, I work with Samoyed Rescue and we have purebreds as well as mixed breeds.

zqVDJxUIaa	A fish will go into a period of 'rest', but won't technically 'sleep'. This is why it is important to have at least 8 hours of darkness in the aquarium, to prevent stress to the fish. Fish need darkness, too! When they rest, their fins will be moving slightly to keep them afloat, but they will be very still. Their eyes will be open, of course, because fish don't have eyelids!<br>  All animals (and fish) sleep. Except for the beneficial bacteria that grows in aquariums...they are hard at work 24/7 keeping your aquarium safe.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|EJxVyd0Baa	Fish Absolutely sleeps!!

gzpaMVnqaa	My goldfish also developed black on its fins, not from ich but after a time of poor maintenance :s.<br>  I have searched for an answer but haven't found much.

1gDTiPVyaa	Scaly-face mites? Maybe. Go to www.birds-online.de and look up the pictures of what a scaly-face mite infestation looks like. It's a budgie-specific site, but the photos are really good and clear. If your bird's beak looks anything like the pics, you need to get to the vet.<br>  <br>  It might be nothing--he might just be growing in new feathers or he might just have an itch, but you might as well check it out since it doesn't take but a couple of minutes to look it up.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	First you need to have the vet do an exam to see if it's actually allergies or something else.  She may need antibiotics, ear mite treatment, a grain-free food, or something else.  If the vet diagnoses allergies, he'll go over treatment with you.  My cat has allergies and I run an air purifier for him which helps alot.  The vet gave me Temeril for his symptoms because I opted out of giving Benedryl (it causes messy foaming at the mouth). The main thing is to get a diagnosis so you're sure you're not letting your cat suffer from a URI or other condition. Sneezing is a general symptom for respiratory issues. Treating the symptom will do nothing to cure the condition.<br>  <br>  Never, ever give any medication to your cat without your own vet's approval.  Most human medications are toxic to cats and those that aren't require proper dosing to prevent overdose.|`|2947eqSGaa	My vet instructed me to give my cat benadryl for his allergies. Don't just pour benadryl down your cats throat, call up any vet and just ask how much you should give her, it's only a few mililiters. This will patch her up, but be extremely careful and maybe give her a little less than what the vet says, I know someone who accidentally gave her kitten too much. As for her ears, take a peek inside. Are they clean or do they have black dots inside? The black dots are ear mites and they are a nuisance. You can buy wipes or drops to put into kitty's ears to keep away or treat the mites.

All American females but my current is German descent, working line male with boundless energy and intelligence.  Every one of them have been fantastic with children. Smarter than we were as parents.  <br>  <br>  They are extremely gentle with kids especially little ones. They are very gentle with furniture. They will not do what you don't want them to do if they understand what it is. They have prey drive but adore all living things. The prey drive is used to train them.<br>  <br>  They are great guard dogs. They warn first by barking. That's all they have to do. No one crosses a GS barrier. My male knows what's going on in his yard from inside the house even during the night as did the others. Wonderful hearing and scent. If I don't speak to whoever has come onto my property he will back them off slowly until I speak to them. If I speak, he accepts them.<br>  <br>  They will body block one child from another if they perceive either in danger. They will quietly lie down between your wife and the service people in the house. Quietly, silently protecting. <br>  <br>  They will protect you from aggressive dogs. My first sidestepped two aggressive dogs, touched her nose to their flank and they immediately fell and rolled away. I was amazed.  <br>  <br>  My male will give a short low growl to unsocialized dogs he meets that are going out of control Every one of them go no farther, settle down and quit. I wonder what he's saying. The first GS that talks to me with growls and  body language. None have ever bitten anyone or thing.<br>  <br>  GSs need 1-2 hrs of off leash exercise daily or they'll become despondent. They're fun to train because they learn so quickly and retain what has been taught. They're owner pleasers. Mine will do anything to hear the word 'good'.  None have been treat driven.<br>  They require a Pack Leader and learning through out their lives. They will mirror your activity level any time anywhere.  <br>  <br>  Amazingly they don't eat much. If not neutered, they'll keep their exact weight through exercise. <br>  <br>  All my GSs needed a home except the first one who came from an excellent breeder. It was my gift to that first wonderful GS to always give a homesless GS a wonderful life.<br>  <br>  If you decide to go the breeder route be very careful, visit as many as you can first.  After my current male, I've come to prefer German exports. Germany has an unbelievable screening process for their dogs. His parents had to pass a Cholesterol test before they could be exported.  Many screens in Germany before his parents could breed.<br>  <br>  GS Rescues have great GSs too. I've found all mine there.<br>  <br>   I would not recommend American show line GSs though that's exactly what our first GS was. Germany is appalled at what the AKC has done to the American GSs.<br>  <br>  A good place to learn about GSs and how to be a Pack Leader  is www.Leerburg.com. A very well known GS breeder focusing on Schutzhund and Police trained dogs, supplies and training DVDs, ebooks, a very interesting forum too. Where I learned to use a Dremel tool for toenails while they fell asleep as I filed away.<br>  <br>  Another excellent website is the German GSs pedigree website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pedigreedatabase.com/gsd/info/14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pedigreedatabase.com/gsd/info...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You might fall in love with the breed as I did 7 Shepherds ago.<br>  I don't think you'll regret your decision of a GS, I never have.|`|lmSffrNuaa	Hi!

They will even stop the parents from using physical punishment on the kids.  They are very adaptable and highly trainable.  They'll readily and knowingly give their lives to protect their family.  They are the epitome of problem solvers.<br>  <br>  But this very trait can be a drawback too.  If bored, GSDs will get into mischief and become destructive.

To be dragged through hedges and muddy rivers at the end of his lead. <br>  <br>  I have friends - no lightweights - who chose a larger breed of dog that then decided to grow more than expected to about the size of a small horse.

Good guard dog?  Good in obedience, agility?  Good as a quiet companion?  Each would lead to different breeds.<br>  <br>  Aussies (Australian Shepherds) are a medium size breed.  They are very energetic and need lots of exercise and mental stimulation.  Walks, even long ones, don't constitute lots of exercise.  If your not willing to devote lots of time and energy into the dog, don't get one.<br>  <br>  Saint Bernard's can be quite intolerant of children.  The last time I checked, they headed the list by percentage of numbers and severity of hip dysplasia (HD).  They also drool and are heat intolerant.<br>  <br>  Great Danes are true gentle giants.  Though they will protect their home too.  They are gentle with kids and usually get along well with other dogs, cats and animals in general.  They can't be expected to keep going as long in playing frizbee, flyball or run marathons, like aussies, but can be energetic enough to compete in agility or go on jogs.  They are also inveterate couch potatoes.  They are very conscious of their body size and almost never sweep a table with their tail like a lab will.  They do tend to have average lifespans of 10 to 12 yrs, which is shorter than most smaller breeds.<br>  <br>  Consider your lifestyle before choosing a dog breed, then look for reputable breeders, not pet stores.  Shelters have ups and downs as a source to get a dog from.  If you're not experienced in handling and training, remember that many shelter dogs are there because of behavioral reasons.|`|LaqT3K4Gaa	if you want a big dog, then the suggestions would be some of the ones you listed or a golden retriever. golden retrievers are really sweet dogs and they absolutely love water. on the other hand st.bernards have a  drueling problem  and ive seen great danes when i was walking down the street and they were half the size of me! another suggestion would be a retired racing greyhound they're pretty cool and once they retire from racing, if no one takes them, the get put to sleep TT^TT but  greyhounds are not as big as the other dogs you mentioned but they're still real sweet ^^<br>  hope i helped ^^|`|t8GjNSgDaa	Myself I would go with either an aussie or a lab or perhaps a mix of the two.

We had to get rid of him though. (not because of his behavior)<br>  i hope you enjoyed the story of my doggie ^^|`|6M1Z3XIdaa	i won a cute little puppy at a church fair. took her home, made a little bed for her, put a clock in it. gave her food and water. played with her and held her for awhile. then closed her in the room for the night. <br>  she found a can of white paint. the lid was not on tight. the next morning our black puppy was white. the walls of the room were white. the floor was white. her bed was white. it explained why she was so quiet all night. <br>  the vet said that the paint did not do any harm to her. the bad part of taking her to the vet was that he wouldn't wash the paint off. he gave us a shampoo to get it off and my mom made me clean everything up because i won her. <br>  30 years later i can finally see the humor in it.|`|WWEYx00Eaa	When we first got our dog, she went into the yard and leant over the pool, drinking the water.

Hmm well the latest story that comes to mind is about my sister in laws American Bulldog, he is the cutest dog in the world, has a face to die for, anyways we went over for dinner the other night and my 3 year old son got out my brother in laws guitar to play it (actually play with it, it was his first time) well her dog (Ruger) jumped on the couch next to him started howling/barking and then nudging my son to play more when he would stop! 3 days later Ruger goes in the room gets the guitar starts pawing at the strings and singing tooo!|`|3A9Rboaaaa	my dog fluffy(whose looks like a long haired chihuhua or short haired pomeranian) always chases the car when i take off to school. dont worry i dont go in the traffic i go through the neighborhood. she looks so cute from the rearview mirror when shes running. But then i have to go and put her in her kennel. im  going to go play with her now lol.
IMPvzBk1aa	Typically the tendon would be examined using ultrasound after a certain predetermined time period to determine how well healing is progressing.  There is little likelihood that she will be anywhere near ready to ride before the 3 to 4 month period, and could require rest for months longer than that.  A tendon sprain is a very serious injury, and one that takes a very long time to heal.  The best thing to do is exactly what the vet who attends to her tells you to do, and not some stranger on Yahoo Answers.  Be patient and do what is best for your horse.|`|RloOJ43haa	The best thing to do it to do exactly what the vet said to the letter. Tendons take a very long time to heal. It will take longer if you do not give your horse the time she needs up front.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	um follow ur vets advice. u can also hand walk her around the property we had a horse with that and u have to be very careful. depending on how high she has a tendency to get u  may need to invest in some ace to keep her calm while she is resting<br>  god luck and this will only make u 2 stronger me and my old horse were stuck with groundwork for about 9 months aft surgery and we had an awesome relationship, i knew him inside and out<br>  good luck|`|oQmL4IdWaa	Follow your vets advice exactly.<br>  <br>  You could also put her on MSM which is an anti-inflammatory supplement, and rub her leg with some ligament or mineral ice.<br>  <br>  It is totally worth it to give her some time off, even though you may be impatient and it seems like she is fine.  If you work her you might make a minor injury into a major injury which will take a longer time to heal or may not heal at all.|`|AA10726599	We use water therapy. Run a cold water stream up and down the leg for 20 minutes twice a day. Start with light stream and get stronger. You don't want her to be in pain with it, if she flinches back off the stream to a comfortable stream. Stay off of her as the vet said. The water treatment will ease the heat in the leg.|`|4EuvWkFXaa	Listen to the vet! The horse needs some time off to make a full recovery. You can also pour about 50ml cod liver oil over her feed once a day, I did this when my horse sprained a tendon (the vet actually advised me to do so) and he recovered beautifully.
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	No particular breed of cat is completely hypoallergenic to everyone.  Allergens are produced in the skin, saliva, and urine of cats so even the hairless ones can cause some people's allergies to flare up.  The amount of allergens produced by cats is cat specific and the only way to find a cat who doesn't cause your personal allergy to flare up is by trail and error.  Some breeders claim to have hypoallergenic cats.  The fact is, some breeds MAY have a tendency to produce fewer allergens but all produce some.  The fur samples they send to you are bogus.  We already discussed where the allergens are produced and fur isn't one of them. Many Siberian and hairless cats have ended up in the shelter because the owner bought it thinking it was hypoallergenic and found the cat caused flare ups.  Allergy specialists can work with you and give you medication to help with your symptoms. Many an allergic person has become able to live with a cat through the miracle of modern pharmaceuticals and regular house cleaning. Here's a good article with info and tips on allergies and how you may become able to live with a cat.<br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=015" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a>|`|44kEtDvIaa	Don't believe there's any such thing as a totally non-allergenic cat.

B3qjtZuRaa	Just keep doing what you're doing, but PRAISE HIM A LOT when he does what you want him to do (pooping outside).  Tell him he's a good boy; give him a treat.  The idea about putting him into a cage at night (above) is also a great idea.<br>  <br>  DO NOT "rub his nose in it"!!  That will only hurt, frighten and confuse him.  It doesn't help anything -- it only makes the training process harder.<br>  <br>  You'll get a lot further with positive reinforcement.  Be patient.  Be calm.  Be a good pack leader.|`|iZS3ydHEaa	Use a crate for at night until he has more control over it. At only 3 months he definitely isn't fully developed. You may need to do that until he reaches a year. My dog turns 1 this month and in the past 2 months has finally gotten control of that. Plus the crate will come in handy when he reaches the chewing stage and decides to eat everything when you leave him alone. Make it nice and comfy and a good experience when you put him in. My dog loves hers and will go in it to take a nap during the day when I am around the house. Give him time and he'll get better. Good luck.|`|vw201sblaa	maybe you should take him out later, like right before you go to bed.... unless you go to bed at 8:05...... if you do, get up one time during the night, about midnight or something, and take him, it takes like 2 mins... whats the big deal? you go to the bathroom when you need too right? why should it be any different for the dog? it can cause health issues if he holes it too long. so be careful of that.|`|1JsWMX0daa	you need to put him in a kennel (a little cage) all day when you are not home. that is how you potty train a dog. if he has to sit next to it all day he will learn to hold it in untill he goes out. just don't forget to lay down news paper.|`|C1cd0KvSaa	Send to professional trainer.|`|YUgBySaNaa	have your parents take him outside, or maybe he is just scared.|`|LaqT3K4Gaa	well maybe he just doesn't have to go then...and i can assure you he does not hate you but you can try calling ur vet and ask him what you should do<br>  sorry i didnt really help TT^TT

ElyP5kLMaa	Mollies are a hardy and highly adaptable species .. thay do like water temps about 75F to 80F. Just by what u say...Thay come up for air, Running into the walls, Stop eating.. It sounds like thay are stress. You can put some Aquarium Salt into the water to allow their bodies time to adjust and minimize stress.<br>  No, fishes DON'T eat there poop!<br>  Good luck and hope helps!|`|LhQ8TYoHaa	fish can actually go a long long time without eating. like you could no put food in there for a week and they'd live. they find stuff to eat especially if ur tank is planted.<br>  i would wait a day or two then start feeding them a really small amount of food.|`|VXZLYJzSaa	If the tank is cold then they will stop eating, make sure they have a heater set to 24-26c or 75-78f which is pretty much normal for most tropical fish. The next thing to do is clear out any food they haven't eaten as it will quickly break down and release something called ammonia in the tank, this doesn't always make the water smell or change its colour but will quickly kill the mollies.<br>  <br>  If you haven't already got them you will need to buy a heater/thermostat and it would be very helpful to also get an ammonia and nitrite test kit as you will need to monitor levels of these in the water over the next couple of weeks or you might poison your fish without realising.<br>  <br>  Right now your tank is probably sterile and hasn't cycled with the bacteria needed to convert the deadly waste products ammonia and nitrite into the less toxic nitrate yet. If this is the case temperature aside, your fish maybe at risk of dyeing from any combination of ammonia poisoning and stress caused illness such as ich, fungus or bacterial infections.|`|2RTpdE98aa	idk about mollies, but I have currently got a green spotted puffer, and it didn't want to eat like for a day, so the next day I fed it, waited 4 a while, and it started eating.

9kceDOTraa	Umm NO, there is a reason they are called shell dwellers, because the females live inside of a shell.  These are the smallest of all the cichlids there are, females might attain a 1 inch size and males slightly larger, so that the male lives just outside of the shell.  If you ever had a shell dweller outgrow a 29 gallon tank, it would be a mutant and a world record.<br>  <br>  I wasn't looking at the spelling, but if greg is correct, then you mislead people on the species.

At my local Petsmarts and Petco's you can either buy several different types of plants:<br>  <br>  1. Plants from their aquariums: I would not recommend unless you plan to quarantine your plants for a few weeks, even up to a month. These are the plants that have snails, worms and other pests. They could even carry disease if the fish in the store tank had anything icky.<br>  <br>  2. My pet stores have plants in clear plastic cylinders. they have several varieties and they have 2-4 plants in a type of gel. You take it home and rinse off the gel. Then you plant it in your substrate (gravel). They are labeled 'snail free' and I have never had any problem with them.<br>  <br>  3. Plant bulbs: These come in a little package, and there are many varieties available. You can either drop them in your aquarium or bury them in the gravel to make them grow faster. I have used several of them. They grow well and are hardy, but some are slow growing. <br>  <br>  Some people use special lights and co2 stuff for their plants. I personally do not. I do however, feed my plants once every two weeks with API Leaf Zone Plant Food for aquariums.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide on: make sure to research the kind of plant you want before you place them in your tank. You would not want anything toxic to your fish. Also, Some fish love vegetation, and if you find yours do, you may do better sticking to plastic plants. If you want to supplement your fishes diet with plant matter, a friend of mine set up a tank just for plants.
KILFoc6kaa	She could be angry with you, something could have startled her when she was in the litter box so she is now scared of it, she could be sick and unable to make it to the litter box, she may be sick and now associates the litter box with painful bowel movements.<br>  <br>  As you can see it could be many things and these options are only a few of the many, check her fecal matter for worms as a first step, then you can start going from there, if she was scared while using the box it make take a while for her to not be scared anymore, if she is mad at you she will eventually get over it.<br>  <br>  If she maybe sick then it may be time to take her to the vet.|`|AA11280073	Yes, she is showing her anger.

But i do think it was the cats way of acting out.  But another idea is did you change cat litter at all?  My cats like one certain brand of cat litter.  Make sure the litter box is big enough so that his bottom doesn't hang over the edge and that's why there was poop on the floor.  Sometimes we need to keep the litter box totally emptied of any poop or pee spots.  If i don't keep up on the litter box every day i can be guaranteed to have poop on the rug or floor somewhere.  I guess they just don't like the smell of all that dirty litter.  Good luck!
ITnQEUQTaa	As any mother can tell you from (painful) experience the milk ducts need to be emptied so yes feed from the nipple.  Sudden weaning and not draining the milk will greatly increase the chance of abscesses forming; it is vital that the breast is emptied.  <br>  The  nursing of the pups, if allowed by the dam, is very beneficial in the treatment of mastitis since the infected milk is continually drained from the teat. Additionally, the ingestion of infected or antibiotic containing milk is generally not a problem (unless the gland is abscessed or gangrenous) in the young animal. <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/mastitis-in-dogs/page3.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/mastitis-in...</a><br>  <br>  Use both hot and cold compresses alternately as this provides relief - massage is also helpful as is encouraging the pups to feed from different angles.<br>  <br>  Find out if your vet is willing to use ultrasound on the infected site - this treatment is used for humans and really helps.<br>  <br>  This person is asking for information NOT opinion - all evidence shows that continued feeding is best for mother and pups!!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Of course you should not let a puppy drink from an infected nipple, common sense there.|`|X7i59NeIaa	As you said it is obviously painful.

V7AAba8Laa	We live near a lake in OH also, and I always hear geese bedding down in the back fields (they never seem to shut up, not matter what the hour!)  It's possible that something disturbed them or they are just having some disagreements over who is bedding down where.  Both gulls and geese are primarily diurnal, but they are still somewhat active and definitely alert during the night as well.<br>  <br>  This time of year, you are seeing the returning flocks on their northern migration, so there appears to be many more birds than usual.  Some of the birds you are seeing are on a "layover" as they migrate to parts further north.  They often stop over and feed in cornfields, cut hayfields and anywhere they can get a free meal or a little time to rest in a somewhat safe place.<br>  <br>  On a side note, I was happy to see a returning pair of swans fly over the other day (we have a large population of mated pairs on the lake and the local reservoir) and I also saw the first pair of spring robins scoping out their nesting sites this past weekend.  Definitely starting to feel like spring after a long and crappy Ohio winter!!!
e1f14553031ea73247b5b1290c459513aa	Polly...as in Polly Pocket.<br>  <br>  Or how about brand names you see on pockets of jeans like Levi or LEI.|`|wdKsVqbnaa	I am a breeder of hounds, and when I saw the term "pocket beagles" I had to take a minute to comment on the breed.  Here's a little insert that I thought you should read:<br>  <br>  Pocket beagles were bred in the 1300's and 1400's and were said to be about 9" at the withers (shoulder). There is no such thing as a modern-day pocket beagle and in fact, the term "pocket beagle" has become synonomous with poor quality puppies bred for the pet market, and often sold to pet shops. Reputable (U.S.) breeders breed according to the Standard defined by the American Kennel Club, which includes two height varieties: not exceeding 13" at the withers, and not exceeding 15". The light bones, high ear sets and toyish heads that tend to go along with very small sized beagles are listed as faults. <br>  In addition to not breeding according to the standard, the majority of "pocket beagle" breeders allow many of the common genetic defects (e.g., hip dysplasia and epilepsy) to be passed along. The result is often an unhealthy dog. <br>  <br>  It's your own decision on what kind of dog you get, but I felt obligated to inform you of the reputation of pocket beagles.  I wish you all the best!|`|PGwSHENnaa	I am so happy for you! I really don't have a great suggestion for a name, but I did want to congratulate you on your choice of breed. I love beagles, I grew up next door to two of the best.When we decided to enhance our home with one of our own we did our research and learned about the Pocket Beagles. Our Molly is a little under 12 inches, and at 6 years old people still ask if she is a pup! As for his name, bring him home and see what suits him, you will know the right name when it feels right. Maybe you could call him Patrick, in honor of St.Patrick!|`|CcESWX5vaa	what the heck is a pocket beagle?never heard of that breed heard of a beagle which can get up to 25 pds|`|bJh1MesQaa	Hmm....

zYiTRHtHaa	just give him lots of love.<br>  and try not to get frustrated if he's slow at getting things.<br>  maybe talk to someone at a vet about it. <br>  <br>  That's horrible what happened to him,<br>  it makes me sick to hear things like this actually happen.|`|qEy34ueZaa	Persons who do not properly treat animals, do not have self respect either, and have a sick sense of humor.<br>  The puppy gradually will get use to it, and will live a normal life, well as normal as possible. Just be patient, as it is not familiar with its new status and surroundings. The sense of smell and hearing will be heightened. Voice, clapping, will be of great use. My son's dog lost her eyesight due to infection. After initially bumping on things, the same way you described, the adjustment came eventually.<br>  There are a lot of sick people out there!|`|ydshiNrKaa	You need to take him to the vet immediately and find out what happened to the dog.  Then you can either decide to keep him or to give him to a rescue group who deals in handicapped animals.  Blind dogs can lead normal healthy lives if you take the time to train them correctly.|`|nHP9Jq1Baa	I'd say if you can, keep him. And how do you know he was deliberately blinded? Because, depending what country you live in, you might be able to report it to the RSPCA or police or whatever.<br>  As for the blindness, try not to move the furniture around too much, and maybe use a special word for when he's about to bump into something, so he learns to stop when he hears it.|`|xM3iQwhaaa	okay, well if you have steps get a different kind of fabric so that he knows oh theres steps here, like if you have hardwood floors puts a piece of carpet at the top and bottom of the stairs so he knows there stairs here. <br>  <br>  take him to the vet ASAP i can;t stress that enough... <br>  <br>  just guide him and get him use to your voice. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|EgRt4LMfaa	if u keep him keep things the way they are so he knows where everything is. if u play ball go to kmart n get those t ball sets wer the ball is on thick band-not rubber-when u play ball he can smell the rope to the ball. good luck|`|umzuADEkaa	Just like a blind person.He can live a very happy life,at first he will bump into things until he gets used to the lay out of your home.if you are going to keep things DO NOT move your furniture around etc as he will get used to it eventually and changing it around will become very confsuing.just help him all you can but let him become independant also :) good luck!!|`|mfOwtsOOaa	It would be good for you to take it to the vet if you're going to keep it to get it checked up anyhow's but it will need time to get used to your place by scent. Try not to move anything around the areas the puppy is in: objects, furniture etc.. so it has time to adjust to its new surroundings and it will learn where everything is and by scent find its way around.|`|tevQtlrcaa	For one thing try not to move furniture around, eventaly it will learn its way around things. Sorry if thats not quite the answer you are looking for. But for the record, it might help you if you give it a collor with a bell just so you can easily find him incase (heaven forbid) he is def too and wont be able to hear you call his name. <br>  <br>  that is just cold that some one could harm an animal!  =(|`|LaqT3K4Gaa	i was at a petco at a dog adoption, and the was a blind golden retreiver puppy, that broke my heart too because no one wanted him. anyway the owner told me that blind dogs use their smell and ears to live a normal life. so you could take it to a special training class or something.<br>  I hope i helped ^^|`|WKxi3gWBaa	aww im so sorry... take him to the vet tell them you dont want to put him down and you want him to live a good life and ask them on advice or numbers of people who can give you better advice.... poor puppy... take good care of it and lots of snuggles and love!|`|brcuJxkdaa	omg thats so sad i dont now how to care for one but i'll look it up but you should go to a pet smart or petco tomorrow and gget a book on it they probable have one|`|8gFujGXbaa	This puppy deserves to live just as anyone else, even if he is blind. Don't do what I am thinking about, because you will regret it.|`|QPnBOom2aa	thats really sad.. and im glas you took it in.. <br>  i am raising a seeing eye puppy.. and although he is not blind, he has a specific schedule to fit a blind person one day.. i suggest you take him to the vet as soon as possible... and im sure there are suggestions your vet or a pet specialist can give you.. my advice is that you start to get him on a very strict schedule.. he should get up at a specific point, go to the bathrooom right away, and then have his first meal of the day. then about 20 to thrity minutes later, go otside again. you should also teach him to sit before he goes outside by saying to him sit, push his butt down, then put his leash on and give him lots of praise. also make him sit before giving him his food.. <br>  other things like making sure he eats 3 times a day.. once when he gets up, once midday, then once anytime before five oclock.. also make sure his waterbowl is down all the time, but take it up after around 7 to make sure he doesnt have any accidents in the house before he goes to sleep.. scheduling and praise is key.. .he should be on a leash with you most of the time since he is blind.. but for independence, close off one room in the house and puppy proof it, dont switch around any furniture.. and above all give him lots of praise. <br>  <br>  hope this helped!!!
4jyAH75vaa	Definitely wait until they've been exposed to bright lights. <br>  <br>  I heard that the general rule is no flash within 10 feet of young puppies.  Most point-and-shoot cameras have a flash range of about 12 feet, so they'll be illuminated but far enough away from the intensity. I'm not sure exactly when the cutoff of "young" is reached though...<br>  <br>  In the meantime, try to set your camera on a stable surface to take pictures.  Turn off the flash manually, and your camera will probably auto adjust to a really slow shutter speed...that's why the pictures you're taking now are blurry, the shutter speed is probably slow enough that the slightest hand movement will be noticeable.  Setting your camera on a stable surface, and taking photos when they are relatively still, should work in the meantime
B6zl0AJDaa	It's actually pretty easy to do.  You can find the rivets and such at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tandyleatherfactory.com/</a><br>  <br>  They can even give you general instruction on how to apply each piece.|`|8bTder08aa	I've seen a couple of very good leathercrafters do this sort of thing, and my personal preference would be to only experiment with it myself on a piece of tack I was willing to throw away.  If you mess up, you're tack is toast.  <br>  <br>  Also something to be thought of:  if you believe you might ever want to sell any of your tack, this might make it harder to sell.<br>  <br>  You might check to see if a local junior college or adult education program offers a class in leathercrafting;  even if what they do in the class isn't exactly what you want to do, the instructor might be able to help you.  If there's no school near you that offers classes, check hobby shops and craft shops (particularly those that sell leather to crafters) and see if they can direct you to someone who can help.  <br>  <br>  FWIW, my very brief overview of leatherworking led me to conclude that unless you're going to limit yourself to stuff you just punch and lace together, you have to end up buyings some tools that can add up to a fair amount of money.  I wasn't enthusiastic enough about it to spend the money.|`|peDwXmQJaa	A hammer is what I use
AA11716381	This problem is common. Both my cats have had this. <br>  <br>  If it's not too bad, there isn't much need to worry.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned, take your cat to the Vet. They will take a swab of the kitty's nose and test it. They also may prescribe some upper respiratory medications that would help a lot with the breathing and discharge.|`|wZuBbA2Xaa	If she is an orange cat, many orange cats have this condition, but Im not sure why.  If it's interfering with her breathing, it's always best to bring her to the vet and make sure it's not some sort of allergy or anything|`|2uFMBCk8aa	Yes the cleaning is good. I cleaned my cat's nose when she was a kitten and the gunk in her nostrils went away.|`|2947eqSGaa	I just recently learned something interesting about kitty colds from my local animal shelter. <br>  First of all, your cat probably just has a cold, but even if it goes away - it will always be dormant in her immune system waiting to strike again. It's almost like humans and herpes. Even without her showing symptoms, she's going to have it for life. Most cats have it, and there's no way of knowing unless you've raised your cat from birth or have seen her sniffling. My kitties sometimes get their colds, and they go away in good time. The best I can say is just try to keep her nose clean and be gentle - you know how painful it is to wipe your own nose when you're really sick. <br>  If it gets to the point where she's really having difficulty breathing, I say you take her to the vet immediately.
rXMTdUg4aa	Its called an eye cherry. puppies tend to get them. Its a simple surgery at the vet. You can get this done the same day you get her spayed:)|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Its called a "cherry eye". Lots of dogs get it. Sometimes if its small enough it can just be worked back into place. But if its too big it will need to be surgically removed. I would see a vet just to confirm if im right or not since im only guessing cause i can't diagnose your dog online.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Get her to the vet as soon as possible. it sounds like cherry eye which is very painful to a dog and the longer it is left untreated, the worse and more painful it becomes.|`|5yhitoY0aa	This is called cherry eye.You have to take him to the vet as soon as possible.If it is the beginning stage then it could be treated easily.But if it is little big then it has to be removed surgically.So better get to the vet before it is too late|`|e1f14553031ea73247b5b1290c459513aa	Regardless, an infection can cause eye damage.

azDWmNxcaa	You can get products that raise the ph, you would constantly have to keep adding them though, research fish that can live in that ph range and put them in will be easier though.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	If this is a new aquarium you could work around the pH you have. There are fish that prefer a lower pH.<br>  <br>  Or you could buy a product from the pet store to raise the pH. I don't personally like to use these. <br>  <br>  RO water is another possibility.|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	Small,frequent water changes. Don't waste your money on those additives,they don't work. If your tap water has a pH higher than 6.0 you have allowed the tank to "sour". The safe way to correct this is by doing small (20%) water changes every day or two until the water returns to the normal pH. If 6.0 is your normal tap water pH,then just do the water changes weekly.|`|VXZLYJzSaa	It would depend on the types of fish you're keeping. If its mainly Tetras or other South American fish, Gouramis or Rasbora then probably nothing if its holding at 6.0 stable. If it isn't these types of fish or you want to raise the pH to a more neutral 7.0 for a community tank start off by checking what your tap water's pH is and also check your tank and tap waters hardness - the scale you use will depend on the type of test kit you buy or use.<br>  <br>  Generally if your pH starts off higher then drops quickly due to a lack of hardness in the water then you might want to buffer your tank by adding a teaspoon or two of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda - buy one without an anti caking agent) into the fresh water you add for a normal water change.|`|fMiLQnSJaa	Buy a pH buffer at the pet store.  I use one that keeps the pH at 7.0 all the time.
igRC4Scqaa	There ARE those who have indeed "mixed" the pug  breed,making the offspring unregisterable by AKC standard.  FACTS do need to be made "VERY CLEAR" however, Black and Fawn are ONLY "standard"colors (meaning the standard  ONLY allows the Fawn and Black Pugs "to be shown in AKC sanctioned conformation events",) .... it does NOT mean that black and fawn are the "only" AKC registerable Colors found in the Pug Breed. Non standard AKC "registerable" Pug colors do include Silver, White, and, Brindle.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Thats just it reputable breeders do not breed for this. its against standard and reputable breeders only breed true to the standard.

8e13291b33ff9fcfc620b014d57ead81aa	Your best bet is to stick with what the cat prefers.<br>  Otherwise at anytime he could decide not to use it.<br>  <br>  Research has shown that cats prefer sand like,non clumping and unscented litter.<br>  <br>  Inappropriate elimination is one of the top reasons cats are relinquished.<br>  <br>  If you know that he will use one type do not change it.<br>  <br>  Is a flushable litter that important?|`|DXzI2jrEaa	It's unlikely your cat will adjust to the new litter.  Some cats don't seem to care what litter is used, but your cat apparently does, and you'll find it's not worth the effort.  Your cat is already letting you know the only way it knows how to communicate that it's not happy with the new litter.  For both of your sakes, it's probably best to stick with the old litter.|`|FC34jxiaaa	I use wood pellets, and they are awesome -- very low maintenance, and very inexpensive.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pelletheat.org/3/residential/fuelAvailability.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pelletheat.org/3/residential/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.felinepinelitterbox.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinepinelitterbox.com/</a><br>  <br>  The bottom of this page has a recommended method for transitioning to a new litter:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.naturesearth.com/felinepine/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturesearth.com/felinepine/</a><br>  <br>  Personally, I wasn't quite that cautious.

That worked ok with my cat, but I'm sure some cats are harder to please.<br>  -------------<br>  "If he uses the box when the old type of litter is in it then why switch the litter?"<br>  <br>  Wood pellets compared to clumping clay litter:<br>  <br>  * Flushable<br>  * Easier to maintain -- when used with a sifting litter box, you never need to clean the box or perform full litter changes. Wood pellets are lighter than clay, dust-free, and aren't messy.<br>  * No tracking -- the pellets are too large to be tracked, so you won't find them all over the house.<br>  * Cheaper -- Only about $6/year for one cat (60 lbs of pellets)<br>  * Completely safe for all animals -- Not harmful if swallowed, no dust that can be inhaled.<br>  * Environmentally friendly -- Wood pellets are made from waste product (sawdust), while clay is mined. Wood is biodegradable, while clay is not. Optionally, the used litter can be composted.<br>  <br>  So... why would anyone use clay?|`|DtsxooZUaa	I totally understand your dilemma. I am not sure which flushable   you are trying but there is more than one now. I personally use the flushable kind myself. <br>  <br>  There are 3 that I know of: <br>  1. Feline pine: This one takes some getting used to. My cat hated it then slowly would use it. <br>  <br>  2.Yesterday's news: Sure it works but smells ungodly. <br>  <br>  3.Swheat scoop: (personal fav) My cat loves it! it took Zero getting used to. and it does not smell. you should be able to find it in the grocery store also, so if going to petsmart is a challenge its an easy find. <br>  <br>  If you cat continues to be stubborn...immediately after eating- pick him up and lock him in your bathroom (or wherever you keep the litter) for 15 mins or so, it sounds like you need to get back to the litter training stage for a couple of weeks or so. He'll catch on.|`|2947eqSGaa	If he uses the box when the old type of litter is in it then why switch the litter?<br>  Anyway, I use tidy cats multiple cats litter. I haven't actually flushed my litter in ages, I just find it easier to scoop into a grocery bag and toss it into the outside garbage can.
9kceDOTraa	You usually are  better off isolating a fish in most cases for treatment.  While some medications like Pimafix and Melafix aren't quite so harsh on a bio filter like a strong antibiotic, you can reduce the amount of med you need by moving an afflicted fish to a smaller isolation tank for one, and as well, have little worry about damage to the main tank bio filter doing it that way. <br>  <br>  Medicated "baths" are also highly effective in recovery, depending on a couple things.  The overall health of the fish to start with as well as the extent of the injury itself.  If this is just skin damage, I would treat as follows.  Isolation tank with use of Melafix, combined with giving the fish a Methelyene Blue "bath" in a bucket for about 20 minutes, and use of salt in the isolation tank.  The Methelyene blue has properties in it to prevent infection and promote good recovery on the site itself, as well as increase the O2 uptake ability.  Salt will induce your Oscar to start some slime coating going over the site also to help prevent any infections, and the Melafix is a natural tonic to help the recovery.<br>  <br>  Post some pictures though.  I'm just taking a guess at what might work for a minor injury.  It's worth while to examine how and why this happend too. Are there any tank mates with him/her in this 125, what diet are you feeding it, and what does your tank water look like in terms of water chemistry?

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  While you are quite excited about getting a new kitten, this baby is far too young to leave its mother and litter mates. Please do not listen to folks who tell you it is fine! It is a bad idea for both you and the kitten.<br>  <br>  Years ago I was a registered CFA breeder of Siamese and Oriental cats and I never let my kittens leave home until 12 weeks of age. The kitten still needs immune protection from mom's milk, as she still is nursing, and needs to be socialized with people and her litter mates to become a fully developed kitten.<br>  <br>  Kittens that leave their mothers too early are open to disease, can be withdrawn and very unhappy. 4 1/2 week old kitten's eyesight is not fully developed either. They more than likely still are not fully litter trained. It is just not fair.<br>  <br>  It is one thing to rescue an orpan whose mom has either died or abandoned them.. or worse.. been tossed out by the owner to fend for themselves. but to purposefully get a kitten this young is really not wise. The cat's owner doesn't really understand the make up of kittens and just wants to be rid of them.<br>  <br>  So perhaps offer her a few bucks to hold the kitten for you until she is at LEAST 8 weeks old, or find an older kitten at a shelter or adoption center. <br>  <br>  As far as caring for a kitten this young, they have to be fed every two to three hours, and no milk meant for humans offered at all. You will need Kitten Milk Replacement, and slowly begin to give your kitten moist kitten food. By the way, that every to to three hours is around the clock, so you will have to set your alarm clock and get up to feed her. She may still need some help "peeing" so may possibly have to stimulate her elimination processes after feeding, with a warm moist washcloth.<br>  <br>  Just so you know about kitten developmental stages and that I am not "daft" about the age that kittens should leave home, here is an article by a very reliable website about the topic.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/kittendev.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/kitten...</a><br>  <br>  Please wait another 4 weeks at least so that your kitten is old enough to be away from Mom, and has had a chance to learn how to be a cat. Mom will be teaching her things, and being able to interact with litter mates is essential for normal development.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|mgiJVjaKaa	You need to wait until she is 8 weeks old. Kittens *need* their mother for nutrients and they are not fully weaned until they're 6 weeks. Yeah they'll eat "solid food that has been watered down and made mushy" at 4.5 weeks, but they still need nutrients from their mother's milk. Mom cats and other kittens in the litter help socialize them. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if the people are giving her up are completely oblivious to her needs and will give her to someone else (who may be completely ignorant about her needs) right away if you say you want to wait, you can keep her at 4.5 weeks. You need to get her a warm bed, a water bowl, and some kitten replacement milk (not cow milk!!!!) and wet food. Mix some of the wet food into the milk and show her how to eat it off your finger so she'll know where it is. Do *not* get her clumping litter (kittens that young eat it - clumping in their intestines is not good). Get her non-clumping litter and a small litter box that she can reach. And kitten proof your house. No strings, wires, sharp objects that could hurt her, etc. Keep her in one room until she's more stable and able to move about.<br>  <br>  To wean her completely, you can slowly lower the amount of milk you put into her wet food as she gets older (5 weeks to 6 weeks) until it's just the wet food.<br>  <br>  As for wet vs. dry food  - only wet food at the beginning. When she's older (8 weeks+) you can slowly mix in solid foods, but wet food is healthier for cats if you can afford it and keep up with it. And use a high quality kitten food. For all the nutrients that it'd be missing from it's mother, you don't want to be further depriving it by giving it something inferior like Friskies or Kitten Chow.<br>  <br>  Our kitten has been on Wellness canned food since we first got her. We mixed milk in it until she was 6 weeks. At 8 weeks we gave her a bowl of solid food (also Wellness) in addition to her wet food (did not mix them together) since she likes crunchy foods.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	I'm not sure about where you are, but in some places it's illegal to take kittens from their mothers till 6 weeks old. A 4 1/2 week old kitten is still nursing to some degree. Even if it's not, the kitten needs to stay with it's mother till at least 10-12 weeks old. After weaning, mom cats teach their kittens important survival and social skills. Kittens taken from their mothers too soon often have issues with inappropriate scratching and biting and with aggression.  Sometimes they are very shy. Tell the owner what I've told you and ask her to hold your kitten and the rest till they are old enough to be sent to new homes.  You want to spend your time playing with your new kitten, not trying to make him stop biting you or attacking your feet as walk by him. A kitten hiding under a bed is no fun to deal with either.  The wait will be well worth it. Ask the owner if you can drop by some days to visit your kitten.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi i have grown up cats from baby kittens that the mothers just dumped in the barn and left.  You shouldn't have any problems just make sure you have a good kitten food and some wet or canned kitten food.  I would also still feed him milk for a while yet as he needs to develop his bones etc.  He will just be lonely so get a stuffed teddy bear and a warm water bottle and he will be just fine.  Just make sure that the kitten is drinking from a pan too.  If not you might have to feed him by bottle for a couple more weeks.  Good luck!|`|gU34xa9vaa	Hi again, just realised this is the same kitten I've already answered about once, so you'll already have my answer recommending you take notice of Troublesniffer, be assured she does know what she's talking about !!!|`|98213410df5614ac2608fd2a80978670aa	I found my kitty L.K  (Little Kitty) last year, think she was about 5 weeks old.<br>  I bought kitten chow (think it called that) comes in a yellow bag or box, don't buy the stuff in the blue bag/box (has milk in it) will give your poor kitten bad bad upset tummy and the runs. Any vet will tell you, it's not good (kitten can't have milk).<br>  <br>  I also bought at Wal-Mart a blue/ white can of cat milk replacement ($9.89) it's powder cat milk, i made it up with warm water and feed it to her off of an old measuring spoon ( mix it in a small cup, and put her on my lap) i would feed her the milk 3x a day Am/midday/PM.<br>  <br>  She loved it and got use to eatting it, as time went on i would up the amount of water and powder (as she got older).<br>  I would add a little bit of water to her dry food (it's a little hard) but she didn't like it like that, so i would add a little of the replacement milk.<br>  <br>  After a short while i bought small cans of can cat/kitten food. Make sure you make her a little bed and get some toys.<br>  To make it feel welcome, and try to feed and play with it before you go to bed. So that way it is tired, make sure you keep putting it inside it's little box.<br>  So the kitten will know where it's box is. The first few days might be a little hard, until it gets use to not having it's mother there (so it is going to cry a lot) make a point to make a fuss of it and playing with it a lot.<br>  <br>  And let it sleep with you, and be near you............<br>  <br>  P.S As odd as this may sound, baby kittens. Need their mother to simulate them to go to the bathroom (#2) if it is not going, and you notice it's belly getting big.<br>  take a warm wash cloth and hold it under it tail. I learned that with LK (when her tummy, ballooned up) called the vet, and was told what to do. It take a while, i had to keep wetting the cloth and rubbing it under her tail (and no she didn't like it).|`|RMmh0aimaa	I have looked after cats as young as 3 weeks old. If it is eating solids already you are fine - but at that age I would think it should still be on wet food - not dry food. And make sure it is food specifically for kittens so it has all the right nutrients.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on them as they are fearless at this age and will do anything, even if it will kill them.|`|8TufRFxIaa	i got mine at four weeks. he is fine now. u just have to have the time to watch them ALL the time. and get up every two hours then go back to sleep.
16xFfHvuaa	Is there new carpet on the floor?<br>  This is very strange behavior.<br>  Does he smell something you don't?<br>  Maybe he senses a ghost in the room.<br>  you better get out of there before it gets YOU!!!|`|UETAqR8Taa	gee thats sad. Something definately terrifies him in the room.<br>  <br>  Has this gone on long? or have you just moved?<br>  Could you also get him a cuddles blanket, that you wrap him in on the bed?<br>  What if you tried leaving a light on ?<br>  Not to scare yo, but I have had an experience in ghosts, but not a scary one. It is possible that is what he picks up.<br>  Also dogs dream, maybe he has had abad dream or he has fallen off the bed at sometime and hurt himself.<br>  <br>  The other easier alternative is to consult your vet and get the little fella an anti anxiety or relaxant before bedtime.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck, It sounds so sad for the little or big dood.|`|ydshiNrKaa	He may just feel very uncomfortable in that room for some reason.  Anything that could be putting off an electro magnetic field like a fuse box, or lots of electric wires somewhere, could be causing this feeling in the dog.  Why make the dog sleep in there when there are other rooms in the house where he feels safe and comfortable.|`|JCNEP903aa	you need to instill a sense of security in him. Keep reassuring him by patting him on the head genlty and in a calm voice, tell him it's ok. Don't get excited because he will pick up that vibe and start having anxiety problems that can lead to harmful behavior and even health problems. Remember that dogs are pack animals and he looks up to you to be the alpha dog. Be strong for him and he will come out of it. Talk to a local pet trainer.You and your pet will benefit from this I promise.Please don't yell at him. This will only make it worse.|`|6M1Z3XIdaa	he obviously does not like your room. either there is a smell that he associates with something bad or something bad happened to him there. (i'm not saying you did anything, it could have been a twisted ankle that hurt him or some sound scared him) anyway, is there another room he can sleep? does he go in your room during the day? if he doesn't, it would probably help if you brought him in for short periods of time to let him know everything is ok. <br>  also is he afraid of the dark? my dog is and i have to sleep with a nightlight in my room for her. <br>  good luck.|`|SWv7QWzKaa	Perhaps a smell from something a previous tenant had in that room disturbs him. A doggie nose is about a thousand times more sensitive than a human. <br>  <br>  Have a look at this article -<br>   <a href="http://www.animalhealthcare.ca/kidscontent.asp?id=6" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalhealthcare.ca/kidsconte...</a>|`|7fsqT04Iaa	no
XurYYreBaa	If you're talking about a pet rat, all you need to do is keep the wound clean & watch for signs of infection.  Bites from wild rats should be checked by a dr. & you might need a tetanus shot.<br>  In either case, rabies isn't a concern.  Rabies is extremely rare in rats. For an animal to become infected with rabies, she or he would need to have been bitten by another animal who has the virus, which is highly unlikely for a pet rat.  Also rat would usually die from the bite before being able to give the disease to anyone else.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Rats and other rodents have a nasty bite that can lead to a serious infection. Care should always be taken to contain any rodent after a bite to determine if the animal has rabies or another infection.<br>  Difficulty: Average<br>  Time Required: Respond quickly and watch victim for 10 days<br>  Here's How:<br>  Stay Safe. Don't approach a wild rat -- generally, they're more afraid of you than you are from them. If the rat is a pet and its owner is around, instruct him or her to secure the rat. Rats will bite or scratch if frightened or handled, so leave them alone.<br>  <br>  If you are not the victim, practice universal precautions and wear personal protective equipment if available.<br>  <br>  Control any bleeding by following the appropriate steps. Avoid using a tourniquet unless there is severe bleeding that cannot be controlled any other way.<br>  <br>  Once the bleeding is controlled, clean the wound with soap and warm water. Clean inside the wound, being sure to rinse away all the soap, or it will cause irritation later.<br>  <br>  Cover the wound with a clean, dry dressing. You can put antibiotic ointment on the wound before covering. Rat bites often lead to infection. If the injury is on a finger, remove all rings from the injured finger before it swells. Watch for these signs of infection: <br>  Redness <br>  Swelling <br>  Heat <br>  Weeping pus <br>  <br>  Always consult your doctor. The wound may need stitches. Since they are often deep, rat bites are of particular concern for infection.<br>  <br>  Wounds on the face or hands should always be evaluated by a physician because of the likelihood of scarring and loss of function.<br>  <br>  Any wild rat runs the risk of carrying rabies. If the rat is not a pet or the owner cannot show proof of rabies vaccination, the victim must seek medical attention. Rabies is always fatal to humans if not treated.<br>  <br>  Rat bites may be contaminated with Streptobacillus moniliformis or Spirillum minus. S. moniliformis is most common in the US. These infections may lead to Rat Bite Fever. Symptoms of Rat Bite Fever may appear as much as 10 days after the bite, and are likely to happen after the wound itself is already healed. Watch for: <br>  Fever <br>  Headache <br>  Vomiting <br>  Pain in the back and joints. <br>  2 to 4 days after the onset of fever, a rash may occur on the hands and feet, and one or more large joints may become swollen, red, and painful.<br>  If the victim exhibits any of these symptoms, see a doctor immediately.|`|ac3fc5e6008c283e53c70e18ca5042e1aa	if it is a wild rat go to the emergency room for treatment. if it is a pet pour a cap full of bleach into a sink full of warm water and soak the bitten area for ten minutes. then just watch and see if there is any redness and swelling. if so go in for  antibiotics. domestic rats don't carry rabies unless they are infected by one of your other pets that had it and you should know that the other pet had it.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	Okay, i am not yelling, i just want to make sure you read this:<br>  <br>  RATS DO NOT CARRY RABIES. THEIR METABOLISM IS DOES NOT SUPPORT THE DISEASE AND IT KILLS THEM LONG BEFORE THEY EVER GET THE CHANCE TO SPREAD IT TO ANY OTHER SPECIES.<br>  <br>  There is not case of rabies in a rat or mouse and just for the record no case on file of a possum either.  Your concern should be an infection from germs. Clean the bite very well and keep an eye on it for swelling pussing or redness. I have read the other responses and am sorry you are getting so many different opinions. However i work for a vet and called my boss for a confirmation on this.|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	If you are talking about a pet rat then no, don't worry. I have rescued rats for a while and i can't even count the times a scared one has bitten me. Not once has there been anything wrong. However keep it clean, any wound from any animal can become infected so treat it like a typical wound. However if this is from a wild rat then get to the doctors NOW. It may not have rabbies however there are many things that a wild animal may carry. Good Luck|`|eEeCIRDaaa	if it broke the skin then yep, you had better get a shot.  You don't want to take the "wait and see" approach to rat bites|`|AA11709878	it depends if its a pet rat or wild rat if its a wild rat yes if its a pet then  no just clean it  and put ointment on it u will be alright   hell my pet rat has bit me and look im still alive and well  u will be fine if its a pet they  normally don't carry anything that wild rats do cause there kept in a clean invioment|`|jqBEPiQDaa	For one thing rats do not spread rabies.In fact rabies is spread through the saliva of infected dogs.Its best if u visit a local doctor and get an antiseptic injection because rat bites can cause plague|`|cSNBibQeaa	dnt wait...immediatly go to doctor to get an injection...dnt wait for nethn to occur...especially nw its disease season...get a TT
7j4IJi1Qaa	This could be a number of things.  Stomach upset, parasite, etc.  Anything really.  The grass didn't make her poop blood.  <br>  So your dog is dragging it's butt, pooping more, has loose stool, blood in stool, and isn't acting like her normal self.  You need to see if a friend can take her in sooner for you or something.  Your dog is obviously very sick.  And needs to see a Vet soon.  Wednesday may be too late.<br>  How long as this been going on?<br>  Make sure she drinks a lot of water.  To keep her from being dehydrated.  <br>  Put her on a bland diet:  Cook some white rice and hamburger.  As that should help quite a bit.<br>  <br>  And try to get her to the Vet sooner.   <br>  <br>  Good Luck to your dog!<br>  <br>  Edit:  To the people who say she needs her anal glands done.  <br>  Did she start sliding her butt before or after she started pooping a lot?<br>  If before.  Then yes that probably is her problem.<br>  But if she started doing this after she started pooping a lot.  Then from pooing so much, and having loose stools.  The reason she is sliding her butt is because it's irritated.  My Vet told me this.<br>  But it still is possible that, that's her problem just unlikely.<br>  <br>  I would say she's sliding her butt because it's irritated.|`|eiGVEPPfaa	she might have ate something that really irritated her stomach, gotten into a chemical or something?  also could have a bad stomach virus or something.. but either way your right.. you HAVE to get her to the vet ASAP.. could be something serious if it was blood coming out|`|Pnh6Vlzyaa	Dude, go to the vet ASAP!!!<br>  <br>  Blood is never normal, especially if it's coming from inside your dog. This could be a serious problem.|`|zS5bCHW1aa	Go to the vet NOW.  u can't wait with something that serious!|`|9zclkqNyaa	If she is dragging her butt, her anal sacs need to be manually expressed.  You can do this at home but it smells horrible and is gross, so you might opt to have a vet do it, especially since there are many other symptoms.  The enlarged glands are also probably the reason for some of her unusual behavior.  She is pooping more often because pooping presses against the glands to release some of the fluid, however, if her poop is soft it won't press against the walls of her colon enough to release this fluid.<br>  <br>  Unfortuantely this doesn't explain the red stool or other unusual behavior, so I'm guessing the anal glands being swollen is only a side effect of the problem.  However, manually expressing them will relieve some of her discomfort and stop her from dragging her butt.  You can find more information on how to do this by googling the question or you can email me.  Hope this helps.|`|JNr6qPGiaa	My dog had the same runny poops and alittle blood and the vet said it was coxcidia and it was dangerous and gave medication for it and I had to have my other dog tested. Pleaseeeeee get your dog checked immediately. That much blood it so bad. Don't wait till Wednesday even if you have to get someone else to take her . She sounds like she's really got a serious problem and is probably feeling pretty bad. Your baby is pretty sick especially with the blood.|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	I would get her to the vet and have an x-ray ordered.  She may have ingested a plastic toy or something that is obstructing her intestines.  This would most likely need to be surgically removed.  If she's dragging her behind on the floor, it could be a sign that she needs her anal glands expressed.  They fill up with fluid over a period of time.  If not expressed, it could turn into a serious illness. Some dogs can do this on their own by dragging their behinds or rubbing it on something, but most need a vets assistance about once a year.  good luck.|`|qfGXtF5taa	She may have a stomach bug of sorts. The poop might be red because her stomach is not able to process out the dyes in food. Or she may be bleeding from her digestive tract. If the poop looks tar-like at times it may be blood. It's probably nothing you did, she may have just eaten a dead frog, or some bad garbage. If I were you I'd look to see if there are 24 hour vet hospitals nearby to take her to in the evening after work. I hope she feels better soon!|`|AA10628838	This could be anything.

I felt horrible for her but we found out if you switch food you have to do it slowly..<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope you can get her in soon.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Your dog has a case of diarrhea and an upset stomach.  The blood in her stool is probably because she has the diarrhea and it's irritating her intestines to the point where they are bleeding.  Stop feeding her and put her on a bland diet for a day or two.  Just give her plain white cooked rice mixed with boiled chicken or hamburger.  give her small portions of this mixture several times a day.  make sure she has plenty of water and that she is drinking so she doesn't get dehydrated.  after a day or so of this mixture her bowel movements should become more solid.  if they don't then take her into the vet and he can prescribe some medication to stop the diarrhea.
1omgPICKaa	Sorry to hear about your finch. :(<br>  <br>  When a bird losses its partner, it is common for them to grieve or feel down for up to two weeks. Anymore and there may be a problem.<br>  <br>  Your peach face may appreciate being introduced to another peach face. Here are the steps you should take when introducing them:<br>  1. When you bring your new bird home, it is reccomended to quaratine the bird for a few weeks (or more) so that it doesn't give your other bird diseases.<br>  2. Put them in different cages next to each other so they can meet each other. Watch their reactions. You may keep them like this for one day to a few days.<br>  3. When you think the time is right, you can introduce the new bird to the cage. If possible, it is a good idea to rearrange the perches, toys, etc to make it look like a new cage. This way, it helps prevent your older bird getting territorial and start attacking the new one.<br>  4. Monitor them closely to make sure they are getting along.

If it's been more than a month pick up some Advantage or Frontline from the vet & reapply it.<br>  <br>  The food they're eating could be contributing to the problem. Lots of cat foods are loaded with things cats don't digest well. <br>  If you buy their food at the grocery store it is poor quality.<br>  Go to the pet store & read labels. Look for the foods with the highest meat content & without corn, wheat or soy. Also avoid BHA & BHT.<br>  Get the best you can afford to regularly buy.<br>  Change the food over very slowly!<br>  <br>  Cats also need canned food. If you feed them only dry start adding some canned to their diet.<br>  <br>  You can also add a supplement like salmon oil that's high in Omega 3 fatty acids.

They do need veggies and fruit daily, i give veggies in the morning and small piece of fruit at night. <br>  <br>  Is he able to eat his hay alright,  i can't see that he can and that is a must for him so you should get him to a vet have the tooth check so it is not lost permanently|`|VdeV0jUqaa	Without taking your little piggie to the vet I dont know what you could do- never seen that kind of a problem in them before. Maybe if you can just describe it to a nurse at your local vet clinic so they can ask the vet if they think you should bring him in.<br>  I really wouldnt know what the treatment would be for that problem.<br>  Yes its true that guinea pigs should get about a cup of fresh produce a day- they really need it for all the vitamins- especially vitamin C. You would be surprised at how much they can eat!|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	It looks like a really bad infection to me. Please take him to the vet or he could stop eating at anytime from pain.<br>  <br>  If guinea pigs don't get food for 36hours MAX, then their systems will quickly shut down and he will die.<br>  <br>  And yes, guinea pigs need at least 1 cup of fresh veggies a day.
OyNJTWaiaa	Here is the answer I gave you on your other four questions exactly the same...<br>  <br>  Check under his foot for sores. If you have sandpaper sheets in the bottom of the cage or sandpaper perches...remove them. They are harmful to budgies. Have natural wooden perches made from safe non toxic branches of differing diameters so his feet get better exercise.<br>  <br>  Four questions the same .....<br>  So, assuming you get 5 points for asking a question....four times five is 20 points...is that the plan ?|`|AA11089301	it hurts!!!

XoAavDz8aa	There are a lot of grants you can get.  I know Petsmart has one.  Also, donations and volunteers are very helpful.  Service groups at high schools can help raise money and will often supply mounds of volunteers.  Also, talk to a social worker and they can set up people for community service to help with cleaning or feeding.  As for vet care depending on the state you can get vaccinations and deworming medications shipped in the mail or you can talk to a vet who might just charge for medications and equipment.  It's always best to collect some foster home volunteers just in case.  Trust me, once you get your feet in the water dogs will start rushing in.  I had a friend who did St. Bernard rescue and she got two dogs her first month and when the second month came around seven dogs fell into her lap on top of the other two and after that they just started coming in left and right.  So if he can develope a network now it would really benifit him in the long run.  I think it's great that you guys are doing research and helping such a good cause.

nmejm9Nmaa	You're supposed to make them drink first. Cats naturally will pee in a litter box, just make sure they know where it is. As for dogs just bring them out side shortly after they have drank some water, get used to the signs that your dog has to pee, younger dogs can't hold it very long. Take your dog generally where he/she or other dogs has pee'd before. Some pet stores sell a neat device that you stick in the ground and it makes them pee in that general spot when they sniff it.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi again, Victoria!<br>  <br>  I can see how impatient you are about getting THIS kitten, but my answer is the same as the other one I posted. This kitten is far too young, even at 5 weeks-of-age. If you read the developmental stages necessary for kittens to go through, you will see that you are taking this baby from its mom much too quickly, and you are begging for problems. Again, if someone finds an abandoned kitten and rescues it, that is one thing... there is no choice on the matter, but taking this baby from mom who is giving it all the essential nutrients, even nursing far less than when born, antibodies to diseases, and training it to be a CAT with its litter mates,is just wrong.<br>  <br>  Please re-read the stages that your kitten needs to go through: <br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/kittendev.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/kitten...</a><br>  <br>  A 5 week old kitten is still considered to be an "orhan" if not with mom. Here is another article that talks about taking care of orhpans.. and while this is from birth to five weeks.. "your" kitten falls within the guidelines.<br>  <a href="http://www.feralcat.com/raising.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralcat.com/raising.html</a><br>  <br>  Additionally, this kitten is too young to receive its first kitten vaccines. They start at 8 weeks-of-age so your kitten will be unprotected for another 3 weeks at least. This can cause major problems with diseases that are very hard to treat in such youngsters.<br>  <a href="http://cats.suite101.com/article.cfm/kitten_vaccinations" rel="nofollow">http://cats.suite101.com/article.cfm/kit...</a><br>  <br>  So please wait until this kitten is 8 weeks old at the youngest.  Again, offer her a small deposit which may help her feed the kittens and hold onto "yours" for another three weeks. It can make an entire difference in the health and welfare of this baby.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association<br>  Former CFA registered breeder of Siamese and Oriental Shorthair cats<br>  <br>  Edit: When you get your kitten, start feeding what the owner of the kittens were feeding, no matter what it is. Then slowly start introducing a high quality kitten food, such as wellness brand- ( we don't do dry food at all because we don't think it is good feline nutrtion) but Wellness comes in both moist and dry. Mix the new food in slowly with the old food. Whiskas is not a great food, nor is IAMS.  It is best to stick to one food and not add new ones once a week. Kittens and cats have very sensitive digestive systems, and abrupt changes in food will cause tummy upsets and diarrhea. Also you should have your kitten's stool checked for parasites, and have your vet treat her if she has them.|`|YBcB0732aa	I found a kitten that was 4 weeks old. All he did was hide under a dresser until I pulled him out. He needed help going to the bathroom, I had to stimulate him to urinate.<br>  ~~~<br>  Now he's a scaredy cat. He hides whenever a stranger comes. Attacks me. Doesn't know how to be around other cats.<br>  <br>  ~~<br>  Some cats taken away from their mother early have problem like the start sucking on things like fabric.<br>  <br>  "ISSUES: POTENTIAL PROBLEMS OF EARLY SEPARATION<br>  <br>  Problems with immunity and health<br>  <br>  "One of my main concerns with early separation is that kittens' immune systems are really developing between eight and twelve weeks of age," says Dr. Arnold. "The immunity from their mother is wearing off, and the immunity from vaccination is just starting to take over. During this time, they are more susceptible to illness, such as upper-respiratory problems and diarrhea." Kittens generally receive vaccinations against panleukopenia, rhinotracheitis, and calici viruses (commonly called the "distemper combination" shot) at six, nine, and twelve weeks of age. However, immunity from vaccination does not happen immediately; shots can take up to ten days to be effective. Up until this time, kittens receive some measure of immunity through antibodies from their mother's milk, but this is also the age where they are beginning to wean. Their immune system "kicks over" from immunity from mother's milk to immunity from vaccination. During this time, their immune system is busy with this task, leaving the kitten less able to fight off other illnesses. "The stress of going to a new home and being exposed to different germs can make the kitten more susceptible to illness during this time," adds Dr. Arnold.<br>  <br>  At six or seven weeks, a kitten has only received his or her first shot series; the new owner must remember to give the second boosters. Sometimes they forget, and this can have disastrous results. Himalayan and Persian breeder Barbara Redalia of Tuleburg Cattery recalls, " Once a pet purchaser bought a kitten from us, neglected to give it the second vaccination, and when their son became allergic, returned the cat to us. Unfortunately the cat had contracted rhinotracheitis at their home and exposed a pregnant cat to this virus at our house. This cat, whose own immunity to rhinotracheitis was apparently waning, became extremely ill, miscarried her litter, and was eventually euthanized."<br>  <br>  "I have spoken to many new pet owners who have purchased their kittens at eight weeks of age, which is the minimum legal age in Florida," says Susan Geren, who breeds Persians and Himalayans under the cattery name Pyewacket. "The overwhelming majority of them had health problems with their new babies, probably caused by the stress of being separated from their siblings and mother at such an early age. I have explained to them my reasons for not placing my kittens early and suggested that in the future they use this as a gauge to ascertain which breeders are more interested in the income provided by kitten sales than they are in placing healthy, well adjusted kittens. It is most definitely more expensive to keep kittens until they are four to five months old."<br>  <br>  Some studies have shown that vaccination at six weeks might be too early. "I once lost a 10-month-old cat to panleukopenia (feline distemper)," recounts Mary Tyson of Thaison Siamese. "After long discussions between the vaccine manufacturer and my vet, Pittman Moore's research head concluded that it was not a bad batch of vaccine. Cornell [Feline Health Center], which had done the post mortem analysis (and also analyzed blood samples taken while the cat was still alive), concluded in conjunction with Pittman Moore that some cats do not develop lasting immunity from vaccines administered earlier than 16 weeks of age, and this cat had had his last shots at 12 weeks. Thereafter I maintained a policy of not letting kittens leave home until they had had their shots at 16 weeks old." "The most important reason I place kittens at 12 weeks of age (or older) is because kittens can be extremely fragile, and putting them in a new home and environment puts additional stress on them, upping the chances of getting sick," says Burmese breeder Jaina Wendtland. "When this happens the kitten buyer blames the seller, and rightly so in many cases."<br>  <br>  When a kitten is ready to leave may also vary from cat to cat, or from breed to breed. Some cats are simply not big enough to go on their own until they are a bit older. Devon Rex breeder Carole Goodwin notes that cats of her breed are small and need a full twelve weeks to mature and socialize. Amanda Bright, who breeds Russian Blues under the cattery names of Kyina and Talisker, notes that her breed tends to be slender and she feels the cats need more body mass to handle vaccinations. She feels it is wiser to vaccinate them a bit later so that the cats can better handle problems if they occur.<br>  <br>  From a health standpoint, it is best to allow the kitten to receive its entire first shot series, including boosters, while at home in familiar surroundings. First shots are not enough to confer immunity, and the kitten needs time for its immune system to change over completely from one system (mother's milk) to another (vaccination). They should also be of a sufficient size and physical maturity before they are ready. <br>  <br>  Problems with eating and eliminating<br>  <br>  "Weaning isn't an event; it's a process," says Dr. Arnold. "They don't just start eating food one day. They eat a little food, nurse, eat a little, nurse, and so on. Eventually they eat more than they nurse, and then stop nursing altogether. This doesn't happen by six or eight weeks of age."<br>  <br>  Left to their own devices, mothers will eventually stop allowing kittens to nurse. With most cats this occurs naturally anywhere from eight to twelve weeks. However, this process is very important, as it teaches the kitten to learn to deal positively with frustration and denial. As the mother starts refusing to allow the kitten to nurse, which the kitten very much wants to do, she teaches the kitten how to cope with that frustration. Kittens who do not learn this lesson may develop behavioral problems.<br>  <br>  Weaning is not simply a matter of getting a kitten to eat solid food. It's an important time when the kitten begins to assert its independence from its mother. This needs to be a gradual process. "For the most part, my babies still nurse at 9 and 10 weeks, and sometime beyond," says Rosi Carroll of Bengals by RoJon. "I have never had a customer call me up after picking up one of my kittens, complaining about the kitten meowing for its mother. They settle right in to their new environment."<br>  <br>  It's also common for too-young kittens to eat poorly and have litterbox problems. Many kittens at age six to eight weeks aren't consistently using the litterbox. I have found that my own kittens can take up to ten weeks to have litterbox habits down pat. And diarrhea can accompany the changes in diet and stress that come with a new home. Diarrhea can be life-threatening to a small kitten; severe dehydration and rapid weight loss is a serious problem when one has so little body mass to start.<br>  <br>  Problems with socialization and behavior<br>  <br>  People often express a desire to have a younger kitten because they are afraid the kitten will not bond with them once older. This is simply not true. As Ann Segrest of Kiriki Korats says, "The older kittens bond with their new humans just fine. Cats do not have, nor do they need to establish their place in the "pack" like dogs must do. This is the myth that must be dispelled so that kittens will have the opportunity to learn from their mothers and be as healthy and stress-free as possible when they go to their new homes."<br>  <br>  It is true that kittens who are separated at a young age from their mothers will often bond to a person as a surrogate mother. This may seem cute, but it's unhealthy. Such kittens will often suck on blankets, clothing, buttons, even earlobes or on themselves. They may become dependent upon humans to the point that they become fearful or neurotic when left alone. Many hide or run at the sight of unknown people. Most commonly, however, cats who are deprived of proper socialization don't learn how to be with other cats. This makes them especially inappropriate as house pets in a multicat household.<br>  <br>  The kitten socialization phase starts at about four weeks of age and can continue until up to fourteen weeks old. Kittens learn to explore their world through this period, under the comforting guidance of their mother. Between nine and fourteen weeks old, they learn from their mother and siblings how to interact with other cats. They learn how to recognize and interpret cat body language. Quite literally, a cat who misses out on this important social step may not learn how to "talk" to other cats.<br>  <br>  It's also during this time when the kitten needs to be exposed to variety of people in a positive way so that it doesn't become afraid of different types of people. Improper early socialization is why some cats seem to be afraid of men, or of people with glasses, or other odd quirks.<br>  ..............."|`|AA11589437	1. So young kittens get diarrheas easily, so it is better not to make too many changes in food. When you find a food that she eats and her poop is fine, stick with that.<br>  2. Boiled boneless chicken is a good treat.<br>  3. Milk is not necessary, in fact it can cause diarrhea. Once they start on solid food, they stop milk altogether usually.<br>  4. Give her a good brand of kitten food.<br>  5. Keep in mind that kittens separated from their siblings so young may develop socialising problems. When I say problems, I mean like they may bite and such, but not because they are mean, they just haven't learned where playing must stop, they only learn that by playfight with their siblings. My cat was an orphan, very small, and although he is very connected to me and thinks I am his mummy and is cuddly etc., I am full of bites. It is better to wait a few more weeks. Or get 2 kitties(siblings). Also at 4-5 weeks some are not even weaned yet!|`|W02kTOqmaa	Well, the cat isn't even weaned yet. SO,,,<br>  <br>  Tell the owner they NEED to keep the kittens until at least 6 weeks. Even at 5 weeks, most kittens aren't fully weaned, and you run the risk of death.<br>  <br>  Tell the irresponsible, idiotic owner that it IS illegalin a lot of places to sell/rehome puppies or kittens before 8 weeks of age, and for a good reason! If they have a big problem with it, you need to contact animal control.<br>  <br>  Stupid people should not own pets.<br>  <br>  As for the kitten, if you DO get it before 8 weeks, take it to the vet ASAP, and they will guide you better then anyone on here can. Canned food (wet food) isn't good for any pet, let alone kittens. It's an ok treat, but should only be fed after your kittens leaves the kitten stage and is a bit older. For now, either a specifically formulated kitten milk or a dry kitten kibble. Just get the poor thing to a vet as soon as you get it.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: I just read your other question. It doesn't sound like the other person is the bad party here. It sounds like YOU are the selfish, idiotic pet owner. Boo hoo, I don't care that you wan't it now. I had my kitten picked out before he was born, and I had to wait 13 weeks before I got him at 9 weeks old. I visited him 3 times a week, and the patience was worth it, because I received a healthy, well rounded kitten. If you can't even give this kitten the proper developmental time, then you shouldn't be getting a kitten. End of story. You've heard 8 weeks is the minimum, you KNOW 8 weeks is the minimum, stop making excuses.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Your kitten has the chance to stay with it's mother and nurse till she feels it's time to wean her.  In cases of orphaned kittens, it is necessary to hand raise them but this kitten is not an orphan.  It's very selfish to take it too soon.  <br>  <br>  That said, please return the Whiskas food and buy some high quality kitten food like Wellness.  If you feed her a high quality diet, she won't need milk supplements, just food and plain water. She'll need to see a vet as soon as possible to make sure she's healthy and to be dewormed at 6 weeks old.  Please don't buy dewormer from the store.  It's dangerous for young kittens.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of websites with info on caring for young kittens and articles to help you with your kitten as she gets older.<br>  <a href="http://www.kittenrescue.org/pages.php?pageid=15" rel="nofollow">http://www.kittenrescue.org/pages.php?pa...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <br>  When you bring her home, have a nursery set up for her in a small room.  Plunking her down in a big house will overwhelm her and she'll likely run to the nearest sofa or bed to hide under it. Use non-clumping cat litter till she's 10 weeks old.  Young kittens taste everything and clumping litter will cause intestinal blockage. As she gets used to you and becomes more confident, gradually let her explore larger areas of the house. Get a stick toy with a feather to play with her and never let her play with your hands or feet.  That makes her think it's ok to scratch you.  Have her spayed when she's 3-4 months old.|`|gU34xa9vaa	Hi Victoria, please take notice of Troublesniffer who knows such a lot about cats and kittens.There isn't much more I can add to her post except to agree that 5 weeks is too young for a kitten to leave her mother, she needs longer to develop her immune system more and to give her a good start in life.The very earliest a kitten should leave the mother is 6 weeks and that's only if there is no alternative.<br>  I hope the person you are getting your kitten from is going to have the mother cat spayed as she doesn't sound a very responsible owner, letting kittens go so young.|`|xHxKDQ80aa	the kitten should go home with you at minimum 7 weeks of age. To me, that is even too young.taking it so young can cause behavioural problems in the future. you kitty needs to socialize with mum and learn how to be a cat from it's litter mates... please please hold off until the poor thing is at least 7-8 weeks old.<br>  <br>   DO NOT FEED CRAP LIKE WHISKAS!!! Feed a food like Wellness, Evo, Now!, Taste of the Wild... Performatrin Ultra, Natural Balance...|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Pretty Kitty and Troublesniffer are right.<br>  <br>  A kitten should stay with its mother for an absolute minimum of ten weeks and preferably twelve. Although they may be "weaned" prior to eight weeks, they will still have the occasional need to nurse. Kittens taken from their mom cats before this time often develop nursing behavior on themselves, other cats, humans, or fabric, and these habits will often continue throughout adulthood.<br>  They also need this time to learn proper cat behavior from their mother cat, including use of the litter box, socializing with humans and other cats. The time they spend with their mother and siblings is very important. Try to imagine how a human would be affected if you took him away from his parents at a very young age, and he didn’t have the proper role model to learn from. Often kittens that are separated from their mother too soon, have problems learning to use the litter box, or will be very withdrawn and shy, and/or have social problems with other animals as well as humans.|`|ztlYJtwGaa	my cat (toffee) had babies and when they were almost 5 weeks old toffee got attacked by a dog and had to be in the vet for 2 weeks.

I know it doesnt sound nice, but you need to get her to eat something. <br>  If youre still having trouble getting food in her, make sure she is hydrated.. that is most important!!<br>  Good luck and I hope things turn around for you and youre family|`|mh17M1B1aa	I would suggest that you take your iguana to a vet for a check up. There might be some internal problems.<br>  <br>  Believe me, most people who have been hired at a local pet store have no background education on caring for animals. You need to go to a qualified vet, who has earned a degree that enables the vet to diagnose the problem.|`|oUTb1zNkaa	TAKE IT TO A VET!!!<br>  <br>  And don't buy a pet that you can't afford the long term care of.|`|wZKb8egaaa	You need to save up some money for a vet (they do have payment plans, you don't have to pay it all up front) because I've never heard of an Iguana going this long without food. <br>  Be sure to take in a stool sample when you go to the vet. If she has stool, if she hasn't eaten AT ALL then there wont be any stools and you'll just have to tell the vet that when you take her in. But if you get a fresh stool, put it in a plastic bag and put it in the fridge and take it in with your ig ASAP. <br>  A month is way too long for an Iguana (and any animal aside from snakes) to go without food.<br>  <br>  P.S. She looks horrible because she is starving. So, she needs to see a vet ASAP. You need to find a way. Like I said most vets have payment plans. This is a recession, everyone is suffering but people still get by. Try. <br>  <br>  P.S.S. That sucks, but guess what? Your not the only one going through tough times. Me and my mom just got finished taking care of my premature (born 3 months early) nephew full time for almost a year before his mom could take him on a fixed income (it means we only get a few thousand a month) and I am a full time student in college. We live comfortably, not the best. But you can get a job and try to help out. I had a job when I was 14 and had been trying to get a job since I was 7, and not because I needed the money because I don't like begging for money from my mom who can barely support us as it is. <br>  And like I said before, times are rough for everyone, you are not alone. But, you know what? You are young, and jobs like young people. Get a part time and start helping out with the finances.<br>  Good Luck and I hope the best for your iguana.|`|wzEcTMBjaa	I am not an expert but from the wierd positions you say she is putting herself into it sounds like something might be stuck in her digestive tract.  she really needs a vet bad|`|lT3Aqt1Caa	try investing in an appetite stimulant.|`|aY08TZIaaa	add something that she likes instead of shitty food :D|`|m8QfHC7uaa	Pull up the internet specific's on your iguana, and look for signs of distress; look at her eyes and her actions. she is probably still reacting to the injuction. However, has there been any other changes in her that you have noticed?  Please talk to a Vet that specializies in reptial behivor, and call them, they will or should be more than happy to help you.|`|K6rZmVmAaa	My iguana did this. I put her a little mushed up food in her mouth by a syringe, then put in a little food with her. After a couple of times she began to eat again.<br>  <br>  Is she drinking?
bEQn0Vrtaa	Call your vet in the morning and get what is called Critical care. It is a powered food that you mix with water and feed with a syringe. They usually take to it quite quickly. I am guessing his mouth is still hurting him and that is why he is not eating. This food is for ill pigs so is very high in nutritional and should pull him out of it quickly.|`|AA11457471	All natural apple sauce is even better. Try wiping some on his gums.<br>  If he's still not eating by tomorrow call the vet again.|`|Z2vlRSzpaa	By all means, try get him to eat! If guinea pigs don't eat for 36 hours MAX, their Systems will shut down quickly and they will die!<br>  <br>  This happened to my guinea pig, she was in such pain. But it was too late.<br>  <br>  You can feed him all Natural apple sauce using a syringe to feed him. Feed him 10mils morning, lunch and night until he can eat again.<br>  <br>  Please don't give up on him, 'cause if you do, he will as well.<br>  <br>  I give you ALL the best of hope!!!!|`|nrHY3JRMaa	i suggest you dont give it baby food. give it a range of different foods including carrot, lettuce, fresh grass, hay and leafy greens.<br>  And probably stop giving him antibiotics completely.<br>  hope this helps<br>  good luck<br>  :D
ld2vmypNaa	NOPE..it won't work<br>  Frog will be gone in days..<br>  <br>  Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care. Sliders are MEAN !! <br>  <br>  Andd eat anything that flies,swims crawls...garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small FROGS  slugs, tadpoles, ghost shrimp , dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples cut up.. <br>  <br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows, just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days!.. They can all be eaten by theses turtles.<br>  <br>  Austinsturtlepage.com’ has all info on care and feeding for all land and aquatic turtles.<br>  <br>  ***They all need different enviroments.***<br>  <br>  Turtles need water only and a basking area for 8 to 10 hrs and fresh food and veggies and fruits.<br>  Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10“ in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ year’s plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And  are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You can’t start sexing till about 3” across.<br>  <br>   ***You need a 100 a gal plus  for 3 turtles, a tank for the frog and a ytank for the anole<br>  <br>  ....And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their  is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Way too small and cramped. Get a larger tank for the turtles. The anole is probably too cold. Does it hang around the heaters?
aeonmRR2aa	Did you buy White Clouds?  They make the water White Cloudy! :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Cloud_Mountain_minnow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Cloud...</a><br>  <br>  ...but seriously, that's a bacterial bloom.  It is caused by too many nutrients in the water.  Be sure to cycle your tank before adding fish, and to do a 30% water change weekly (ideally), vacuum the gravel with a siphon when you do the partial water change, and of course, use filtration.<br>  <br>  Causes of bacterial blooms from excess nutrients include overfeeding, killing filter bacteria, skipping water changes, overstocking the tank, and using sinking wafers that cloud the water.<br>  <br>  Don't worry - the bacteria causing the white cloud are harmless, though it can be a sign that the water is unhealthy.  Just do a partial water change now and check your water parameters (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate) yourself or have your fish store test a sample of your water.  Also, the bacteria consume a lot of oxygen, so keep an eye on the fish in case they start gasping at the surface for air.<br>  <br>  @Buzzsaw.  White cloudy water is not caused by algae or excess lighting - you're thinking of "green water".<br>  <a href="http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/Algae/green-water.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thekrib.com/Plants/Algae/gree...</a><br>  <br>  As for filter cartridges - be sure to rinse them in tank water (which you than discard), not tap water.  Don't replace a filter floss (or sponge, or whatever) until it starts to physically fall apart or is no longer possible to clean - they contain good bacteria.|`|jBh36NTzaa	What type of lighting are you using for your tank?<br>  <br>  Incandescent or Fluorescent? <br>  <br>  If its Incandescent then its the algae blooming because of the lighting. I would recommend Fluorescent Lighting.<br>  <br>  If it has nothing to do with the lighting than you may be putting too much chemicals in your tank.<br>  <br>  Another thing may be if you are not rinsing your Filter Cartridge off before putting it in your filter when you change it. When you rinse it off you will see a bunch of black fluid coming out. Once it turns to clear liquid you should be good<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped
