It has cream, chocolate, egg yolks and caster sugar (super fine sugar).  I followed the instructions - melted the chocolate into the cream, beat the egg yolks and sugar together over a bowl of warm water for 5-6 mins, until it was pale and creamy, then beat it again for another 5-6 mins when the chocolate mixture was added.  I got interrupted a couple of times while I was making it - could that have been the problem?  Or was it because I wasn't able to use it until the next day?   Any ideas?
