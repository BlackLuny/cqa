20090307150523AApXE8t	Environment;Green Living	How do I seperate recyclables?	What is the most effecient way to separate recyclables, and what all can I recycle and can't recycle?  I have searched the web but i haven't found a clear list of things you can and cannot recycle.  I want to start but I don't want it to become a hobby and take up to much time.    I know where to take the stuff so that is not an issue.  I just want to be more green I guess.  So basically is there a guide somewhere to everything I can recycle and how to separate it?? I guess is what I'm trying to ask.  Thanks!

They pick the bark off a big oak tree near our house, and the tree is dying. I've been attached to this beautiful tree, but they're killing it, how to I get them to stop.   P.S. They normally are out there around six in the morning, and I'm  still asleep when they go out.

20090307153919AAtmWAs	Environment;Conservation	Why do we need to save the environment/wildlife/etc?	I understand that if we don't it would be selfish in a way, like it may be putting ourselves higher than nature.  Or, that if we don't it will effect us and we will die...      But aren't we a part of nature and everything we do is somewhat 'natural'.  What makes us to be labeled as against nature?  We use our brain to develop electronics and such but then they are labeled as damaging the environment?      Isn't it true that every cause has an effect.  So, what does protecting the natural world really do?   Why would protecting a national park, for example, be important other than to show what our creations our doing damage to the planet and causing people to go green?        My question is, why do people work to save or protect the environment?  Is it because they are afraid to die, or because they think it is how our real world should be, or do they sympathize with wildlife or what...

20090227075847AAYRS9X	Environment;Global Warming	Is the Arctic Ice Mass Data being manipulated by "Global Warming" believers?	Believers in "Global Warming" were warning us that ice levels at the Arctic were dangerously low even when ice levels grew at the fastest rate measured back in October.  Even while ice levels grew, they refused to acknowledge that the ice levels could reach normal levels and it almost looked like they could be right.      However it was discovered that faulty sensors missed at least 10% of the Arctic Ice.        Now the true faithful are still sticking to their claims that this years ice levels are only slightly above last years levels.  However they omit other years where the ice is much below this years and last years levels.      Currently the ice levels at the arctic are quite normal, being almost exactly between the high measured levels and the low measured levels.       http://www.ijis.iarc.uaf.edu/en/home/sea...       Why would anyone make the claim that this years ice is only slight more than last years, when this years ice is more than the ice levels for the years 2005, 2006, and 2007?  Is this done deliberately to make the "Problem" of "Global Warming" to appear worse than it actually is?      Dr. Hansen has made the statement that he embellishes his data to scare more people into accepting the claim that "Global Warming" is a serious problem.  Are the claims that the Arctic ice is in peril part of this same tactic?      Don't the ice levels look normal, and even rebounded this year thanks to the unusally cold climate?

20090307153446AADfH2d	Environment;Other - Environment	Why doesn't ny state have light policies?	Ny state is ugly. especially under heavy cloud cover (which is often) the light pollution is terrible. I live out in the country and it is so bright. There are no light regulations. Is there anyone lobbying to change this? I'm only 15, but I tried writing letters to ppl but nothing has happened. I think only certain lights that dont shine up into the sky should be used like in new mexico and arizona. imagine looking up into the sky and seeing stars when your in the city! Who's with me?
