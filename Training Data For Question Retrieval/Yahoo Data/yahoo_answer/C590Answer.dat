HA2IV3r3aa	There's absolutely nothing you can do to make your breasts bigger other than surgery.  No pills, foods, massage techniques, or hypnotherapies will make your breasts bigger.  They are all scams and you will just be wasting your money.|`|SFoMSEpgaa	Honey, you need to be proud of every inch of your body. Nobody wants what they have, they always want what's just out of reach. Big ones are not so great in there own way too.|`|s4iVl04raa	There is no food that will make your boobs bigger.  And you're only 14! You're boobs will continue to grow for many more years. Mine continued to grow until I was almost 21.|`|hPRPO3qgaa	if you gain weight your boobs tend to get bigger too. i dont think you can make them bigger with certain foods though.|`|WeNWlYT4aa	potato chips, or corn chips|`|tZxVey2baa	If there was I would market that stuff.|`|DQlZIzAFaa	first off, you're only 14 your boobs aren't done growing until you're almost 20.    second, any food you eat to make your boobs bigger will make the rest of you bigger too. ie: you can't choose where to gain and lose weight when you change your diet and exercise. if you want bigger boobs, you'll need a bigger butt, etc. too. sorry.    third, the birth control pill DOES make your boobs bigger without making the rest of you bigger. planned parenthood will give pills to anyone who asks for them, usually for cheap or free, your parents don't have to know. and, fyi, thousands of girls go on the pill to reduce menstrual cramps, avoid PMS, etc. etc. so it's not like being on the pill makes you a "slut." I know girls who are virgins and have been on the pill for years. however, your doctor needs to know if you're on any medication and, because of privacy laws, your parents don't have to know.|`|iGZWeWwBaa	unfortunately no :(, but you can work out to do it.

I don't think there are any specific foods you can eat, but there are some excercises you can do to make them perky-er.  put a dumbell in each hand and act like you're hugging a tree or beachball.

6nvhmx7Aaa	Okay bad news first: There is no magic vitamin, herb, or pill that can make you loose weight magically. (or in a safe way as a matter of fact)    good news: there are things combined with exercise, a balanced diet, and good sleep to help you along.    my favorite is peppers or anything that is spicy...that is if your not afraid of spices. The spicier, the better! Not only does it improve your immune system, but also clears out your sinuses, and best of all, helps you lose weight!    Think about it: eat spicy and you sweat and feel more alive (due to spicy in your mouth :) , thus burning more calories.    be careful not to eat bad things that are spicy, like taco bell or others....just cook what you eat everyday with sum jalapenos, assuming your eating a balanced diet.|`|Ms72jNbBaa	How much weight do you want to lose, Gilliam?  I can tell you that I'm using some pineapple enzyme tablets that are advertised to help you lose 10 or 20 pounds in a month.  If you want to know how to get them, e-mail me. I think they are guaranteed.  At the same time, I've just begun a vitamin regimen that is probably the best one available - the numbers are not high, but they are high enough, and they are well balanced.  It's in powder form, and you shake it in a cup with a tight-fitting lid.  The vitamins and minerals are very easy for your body to absorb.  People have recovered from all kinds of illnesses from using it.  Again, e-mail me if you want more information on it.    There is a tea called Slim Tea that helps reduce your appetite.  It will be good for you to drink plenty of water, exercise, and eat a reasonable diet, regardless of what else you do.

Losing weight can be done by decreasing your sodium levels or just going to the bathroom.  But I'm assuming you mean that last 10-15lbs of fat.    Well it is easy...simple math...and if you don't complicate things you can safely lose it in a couple of months.    Google "free health calculator" and you will pull up a thousand free calculators.  You need to enter you height and weight and calculate your resting metabolic rate.  That is, how many calories will you burn if you just lay around on the couch all day and do nothing.  Then consume 500 less calories than that everyday.  3500 calories = 1lb of fat.  Depending on your activity level, you'll probably burn 1 - 3 pounds OF FAT a week.    If you have other health concerns like cholesterol and stuff like that you need to consult your doctor.  But if you don't, burning fat is simple math.    Hope that helps.  I went from 200lbs to 126 and I never gained back any weight once I learned how calories work.|`|9XmJPjXvaa	If you want to lose weight fast, you should consider making an adjustment to your diet. Im not talking about just changing what you eat, but also change your eating habits. In some cases, the way you eat: the size of your meals, the time of day in which you eat certain food groups, the time between meals, and the number of meals you eat each day, can have a bigger effect on your weight than the amount of calories that you consume.    If you want to lose 9lbs in 14 days, a possible weight loss method for you to use is Calorie Shifting.     Here are the basic principles of Calorie Shifting  1. You eat 4 reasonable sized meals each day based on a specific and personal menu.  2. These 4 meals contain all food groups (carbs, protein, fat).  3. You need to eat the meals at least 2.5 hours apart so theyre spaced out throughout the day.  The menu spreads the 4 meals throughout the day which causes a metabolic effect which maintains the rate in which your metabolism runs. This causes your body to burn calories faster than it does with other diets.    check the review here http://www.14daysweightloss.biz/|`|2so60OEZaa	it all depends on how much you weigh right now but thats a big goal for a month but i hope you can pull it off!   i would say for stomach fat to run and then do a lot of situps then it helps to form abs.   i always exercise while watching my shows at night|`|iGnUYe9Haa	You can only lose 1-2 pounds of fat per week.

vpoP8ksHaa	LOL      sorry for laughing but loosing your virginity to a candle stick is pretty funny.    well i dont know ahahahaha, maybe yes maybe no.  im so helpful ay|`|6VaXVOCZaa	lmfao why did you putt it in? lmfao probably nott   but thats funyy|`|vJxuWyueaa	This should be in the women's health section.|`|UWuVQ9pUaa	Tell me what were you thinking about when you were doing that ???   Well i don't blame you .. i blame the media of these days ... it really spreads a bad knowledge.    Let me see ...  you put a candle in your vagina... and u still ask are you virgin?, i guess no not any more "if you popped your cherry" . If you dint then i guess you still virgin but mostly it appears to me you popped it already.    Listen .. i've always believed that masturbation is a wrong bad idea. I am sure many people will disagree with me... ok lets figure it out  1. Why do ppl stick things inside while its only a masturbation .. not a sex ???   2. What where you thinking while doing it ???   3. Why do u masturbate ???     I am sure you wouldn't answer the above so i will answer you...     Answer 1. they stick things inside coz they want sex not masturbation. they got the feeling to have sex.    Answer 2. To please yourself.. since your mind was into sex... you tried things so it becomes more pleasurable.     Answer 3. You masturbate coz you got lots of free time and you get horny so you tend to do it while you are alone.     So you see .. its worthless .. i know you will not agree with me but its true.    I would advice.. whats been had already been, look for whats coming.. build your future.. look forward to achieve what you wish .. make yourself busy ...|`|gDu53CIjaa	now u have to marry to that candle bcox it;s now ur husband|`|nsVbWXKraa	ur still a virgin... but that is way way to funny!!!!! ha ha ha ha ha!!!!|`|TPP0p13faa	popped ur cherry yes but u didn't loose ur virginity to a candle stick!! you can only loose ur virginity if you have penis to vagina contact.|`|m9dJH32Taa	Yup, sounds like it.    Congrats.|`|YZaynPl5aa	was it lit ? haha ah no ... r u serious ??? hey i don't recommend putting things in my vagina unless i know it will come out eventually :))) like a tampon , hand , penis' duh. and uh this guys health ....|`|AA11301302	There's a chance you did, but breaking the hymen usually also comes with pain, so it depends if you felt pain or not. Also, if there was only a little bit of blood, you could have just broken a blood vessel or scratched yourself inadvertently, etc.     So obviously masturbation is not the best idea for your emotional or spiritual health, but if you're talking about virginity, it really has to do with intercourse with a man, not with an object. I believe a woman loses her virginity when she has sex with a person, not with any type of object, even if it's at the doctor, etc.     I would focus more on staying pure for the husband you are meant to marry, and engage your mind and heart with other things until sex is appropriate for you and in the right context. But everyone struggles with those desires and sometimes people make mistakes and accidents happen in the midst of those struggles. So, try not to worry about it and just move on. God has bigger plans for your life.... Take care :)|`|QkYgrU33aa	where are you from??  and not rlly..it just means that you have masturbated to roughly with it..anything else?|`|fV8cEjtHaa	Brick Tamlin, is that you?|`|TsjqzanQaa	Men's health?

21f607e2a108c7e5f56649beeb4de243aa	Okay, well, sorry to be Johnny Raincloud, but I don't think that you can cure a fever within one day. The best thing to do is to take either a cold bath, or a cold shower. You can't take a hot one, because that's just multiplying the bacteria even more, and you need to get your body temperature down. Also, for your cough, you should drink hot tea as often as possible, which will clear your throat. Drink cold water too, but not too cold, because it could strain your throat. Don't wrap up when you go to bed. Sleep with only a sheet. If your room has poor heating, or if your room is extremely cold due to the weather (don't judge by how cold it feels now, only by how cold it was) then sleep with a thin quilt, but no thick sheets, because that will only radiate and reflect your heat back to you, which is not good.|`|d3sTQIKFaa	Take some tylenol, but you really should rest tomorrow and not go to school.

CNW6eAjoaa	Sometimes when you have a boil or a pimple, you just cannot resist squeezing it.  That may be the worst thing you can do.  Often the pustule will burst under the skin as well as out the top.This will make the bump look smaller due to draining of the pus, but the pus under the skin will spread the infection.  If you feel this is caused by an ingrown hair, and you are normally a healthy young man, then it will heal on its own in a few days.  If you feel you have to drain the pus off again, (better leave it alone though), do it under hot bath water, when the skin is soft and the surface will burst easily.|`|m5hmJMKZaa	it could be an infected hair that only antibiotics can get rid of, it could also be a cyst or a boil, try putting warm compresses on it and see if it helps.|`|I2gMIWDeaa	It sounds as if you still have a hair inside.  The smell is the puss itself.  Take a wash cloth and soak it in hot water.  Place it on the bump to draw the infection to the surface.  Remove any other hairs that may be inside.  Also.  Be very careful to clean the soar.  An open wound is an invitation to an even worse infection.  Put some anti-biotic ointment on it.|`|oUdo4kBYaa	Have my dogs lieck it ad they get better i time the touge heals from the dog.

MhfneF0xaa	Yellowish is perfectly normal. There is a lot of variation in the color / consistency of semen.    Unless masturbation interferes with other activities, there is no such thing as too much. Many teen and pre-teen boys masturbate once or twice a day, and this pattern can continue into adulthood and middle age. More than this or less than this is also quite common.    If you masturbate often, you would want to watch your technique, so as not to chafe the skin on your penis. Other than this, no worries.    It will not interfere with your hormone (testosterone) production, it will not interfere with your growth and development, it will not cause acne, it will not affect your vision, it will not cause hair to grow in your palms, and it won't show. It is also not addictive. Masturbation will not contribute to baldness later in life.    Masturbation will absolutely not affect your future sex life. You will be able to "get off" just fine by other means in the future. It will not cause premature ejaculation (c**mming too fast). You cannot "run out" of sperm or semen, as these are replaced by your body on a continual basis. If you masturbate a good deal, or close together in time, you could notice a temporary reduction in semen, but it will build back up again.    There are some studies showing that regular ejaculation early in life can reduce the incidence of prostate cancer later on.|`|GgB6bLhTaa	Sperm's color and taste has a lot to do with your diet.

Your teeth hurt because they shifted position.  Your retainer is designed to prevent your teeth from moving back to the position they were in before you got braces.

But for now make sure you drink a lot of water. They say having a lot of fluids helps with back pain. I hurt my back a couple of years ago and I went to physical therapy. There was one exercise that really helped me. Lay on you stomach on the ground. Put you hands in push up position and push the upper half of your body up (kinda arching your back) Do it about 10 times. It loosens your back. Try ice instead of heat. 20 minutes. Good luck|`|QPTlQCiSaa	try using your legs more...lay on your back and try to put your knee to your chest and lay them straight out to the side and kick your leg out...if you feel a popping noise than you should go see a doctor but it doesn't hurt that bad when it pops, really feels kinda good, it will be your SI joint in your pelvis ( a lot of people  don't know this causes lower back pain)....good luck|`|AA11707529	if you are having sharp pain, go see a chiropractor... they are back doctors. At the very least,get an x-ray to see what's wrong. Your back is everything, dear, and the more you put it off, the worse it will get. you may have a slipped disk, or something else. in the meantime, try AdvilPM. It works pretty fast, and gives between 6 and 8 hours sleep. But see a doctor ASAP or you may ruin your back permanently.

Daily use of alcohol while using this medicine will increase your risk for stomach bleeding and may also affect how this medication works. Limit or avoid alcoholic beverages"  http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drug-4069-Cou...          I am a nurse and quite a drinker myself.  What the nurses are you telling you is that drinking in it's self is not good.  In actual though if you just limit your intake.  In other words don't drink all the time and don't binge drink as much as a normal college student would and you should be fine.  You have to remember though that on coumadin since your blood is thin if you develop any kind of ulcer, such as the common stomach ulcers or esophgeal varicies that an alcoholic would develop this could be very detrimental for you.       Of course for the final answer you can always call you doctor and ask his opinion.|`|XFB0KTmYaa	I am an RN my friend.  What I can simply tell you is first.  Any drug combined with alcohol is usaully not a good thing.  However, it depends on your intake of both drugs. (yes, alcohol is classified as a drug).  In moderation, there is absolutley nothing wrong with drinking alcohol while on coumadin.  A beer or two, a glass of wine, this is all suffice to consume.  Now if you are downing shots and Sicialian kiss's at your local pub....that is different and WILL cause an interference with your Coumadin (AKA Warfarin).  Now with all that said, follow these steps.  Take your Coumadin as prescribed, get you PT/INR levels checked as often and as on-time when you need to.  Stay away from dangerous activities to avoid injuries that may make you bleed to death.  Buy your self a soft bristled toothbrush.  And most of all, avoid foods and supplements high in Vitamin K, (which reverses the theraputic affects of Coumadin) Foods high in them are green leafy veggies, like broccoli.  Live a normal life, have fun, be safe.  I mean Jesus, your surgury is a big deal at your age, Alcohol should be the last thing on your mind brother.  But when you feel alright, and things are going well.  A beer or two will not hurt you at all.  Remember also, that Coumadin is a slow acting blood thinner (AKA Platelet aggragator)  Which is a fancy way of saying that Platlets wont stick together.  See When clots form to seal wounds in and outside the body, Platlets do the job.  When Cells are injured and rupture in the tissue occurs, Bleeding takes place.  to stop the bleeding Cells release histamine which is known as the panic button for a way of cells to communicate.  When released, these Platlets respond and immedialty mobilize and go to the site to clump together and form a clot.  Fibrin converts to fribrinogen and are clotting factors that allow Platlets to clump.  Coumadin and other blood thinners interfere with the Platlets conversion's of Fibrin to Fribinogen.  Hence, they dont clump up and form clots.  Because you have a mechanical valve, Not all the blood will be pumped out of the heart like before, some will stay behind,  Without proper blood thinner's.  That lagging behind blood will clot and you could have a serious problem called a Pulmonary Embolus if that Clot gets into the lungs from the heart, and this could cause severe complications and even death.  Coumadin helps prevent the formation of clots, (it does not dissolve them)  So yes,  maintaining your therapy is a must for you now,  and remember, ETOH (alcohol) also thins the blood.  SO BE CAREFUL!!  But a beer now and then,  kick back brother, you will be fine.  Just make sure you are chasing it down with food to slow the absorbtion into the blood,  And never ever take your Coumadin at the same time as drinking, take them like four hours apart and you have had at least 1-2 meals consumed.  Hope this helps|`|vVTmJjJDaa	i couldn't find any - yet, i'm not surprised, because the cause of death most likely wouldn't be *directly* due to the alcohol and coumadin, but rather, as an *indirect* result...    for instance, say you had your PT INR tested the morning after a drinking binge - your clotting time would be longer due to the alcohol...and your doctor (not knowing about the drinking binge), would therefore lower your coumadin dose - to a level that could potentially not be enough to keep your body from forming blood clots - thus, potentially causing death due to a clot travelling to your lungs or brain...just as if you weren't taking any coumadin at all.    yet, the opposite situation is a much more common cause of death in regards to coumadin and alcohol consumption...say you hadn't been drinking in several days before your PT INR test - and your clotting time was quite short - your doctor would therefore raise your dose of coumadin....now, say you've been taking that high dose of coumadin for a week, and you decide to go out on a drinking binge - yeah, the average "college partying" drinking binge - you get into a car accident on the way home, and suffer minor injuries, with internal bleeding - what would have been *minor* internal bleeding, is instead *major* internal bleeding - and your chances of death are VERY high - even if you're immediately treated on the scene by paramedics and rushed to a state-of-the-art hospital, your chances of survival are slim, and even if you do survive, the permanent damage that has been done to your body will be quite severe.    same problems arise with external bleeding...say, you and a buddy are camping in a remote area, drinking a case of beer, and decide to take the boat out to go fishing - you suffer a gash on your leg while exiting the boat....normally, that bleeding may have been able to be controlled with proper compression - yet, due to the alcohol, the bleeding is unstoppable...and the nearest hospital is 50 miles away....you die.|`|vrHwx5dsaa	no you should not drink excesive alcohol when your on coumadin

If you wore pads during your period, the chaffing may have simply irritated things as well.  It's not related to your vitamin at all.   For now, if you can, try soaking your bottom in fairly warm water or applying a heat pack or pad to the area.  If you have a cyst, that will encourage it to drain itself.  If it's a Batholin's Gland cyst, expect that it may get more swollen and painful before it does drain.  If it doesn't improve in a few days with using the hot soaks and heat packs, then you will need to see a gynecologist.  If it is a Bartholin's Gland cyst, you may be able to feel a lump along the side that hurts, closer to the vaginal opening.  If you do feel a lump, just leave it be.  Don't go squeezing on it or anything- for one thing it will really make things hurt.  The main reason is that you don't want it to rupture beneath the skin, as that will really make matters worse.  For now, try applying heat.  For the pain you can take Ibuprofen.  I also suggest you go au naturel as much as possible, so as not to irritate matters more.  Don't feel bad, it happens.  It doesn't mean you did anything wrong.  The gland can just get blocked sometimes.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	get to a free clinic then.  you have to take care of your regions!!|`|jH9t3D7oaa	I really think that you should go to a doctor about that.|`|wcWTwFFpaa	If you wear pads it could be from that like an irratation, or maybe u have changed laundry soap?

There are public clinics that takes sliding scale payments which means you pay according to, I'd think because your not 18, your Mom's  income. I know this is very embarrassing to you and I understand that by  experience. I'd suggest you tell your mom or a good friend you trust.      if you don't choose to tall your mom or a friend, go to the public health clinic. They deal with all sorts of medical conditions. I don't think you can treat your condition without a doctor. You could need antibiotics or some other prescription drug to clear what sounds like some kind of infection. the earlier you get treated the early you'llll get the correct treatment. Wish you well!

FTRs5w3eaa	You can get pregnant and have a perfectly healthy baby.    Getting pregnant will depend on your degree of PCOS and how your body responds to treatments. Most doctors will want you to try on your own for a year. After that, they will usually put you on Metformin and/or Clomid. They will start you on the lowest dose of Clomid and work up from there if you are still not ovulating. After that it will depend on your reproductive endocrinologist as to what the next step will be, I just described the most common first step.     I too have PCOS and am currently taking Clomid. I will be starting trigger shots in the next few months if I continue to not ovulate while on the Clomid.     As for the baby, the doctor will watch you closely for your hormone levels throughout the pregnancy. There is a higher chance of miscarriage associated with PCOS, but that does not mean you will have one simply because you have PCOS.      Good luck TTC!!|`|zbkk9iX9aa	what is pcos?|`|cq3TRuSFaa	I'm 16 and I was diagnosed with it this year, although I knew I had it when I was 14.. but never went to get a checkup.  My period are very irregular.  I have skipped over a year before, which was amazing ha!  But sadly, the period needs to get out, so my doctor put me on the Loestrin Birth Control pill, and I have to be on it for six months so that it can regulate my period, and they're gonna see if my period will be regular after the six months, if not then I'm going to have to get back on the pill.    I may not know much lol, but I'm afraid that I may have problems getting pregnant too, but thats way in the future for me, so you should go see a woman's doctor, and they'll be able to help you. =)|`|rymcm91Oaa	About 75% of women with PCOS suffer from problems with infertility to some degree, which mainly has to do with anovulation (not ovulating or releasing an egg). Some women take metformin, which helps to restore normal ovulation by improving insulin levels and glucose metabolism. Other women may take Clomid or Follistim, which are medications used to treat infertility.
0xFQj585aa	Yes, as long as you have taken all your pills (and first started over a week ago) - haven't missed any or taken any antibiotics or had any diarrhoea or vomiting then you are still protected from pregnancy.|`|1db16d6fbfe5a357087104b9885f5c27aa	Yes, you are protected. The active pills protect you throughout the cycle.
a490ba490dd387a7492b03d0a65f007eaa	Ok, first of all, you are 13. I do not know if you are a boy or girl, but either way I must tell you, your body is changing. You may be looking at yourself thinking, "I've got all this fat on my body." What is happening to you is that you are going to discover pretty soon that you start slimming up, probably without even trying! Your body is developing from a child's body to an adult's body, and that makes you look and feel kind of wierd for a few years. If you aren't doing it yet, and it sounds like you aren't, you will probably discover that you are a lot hungrier than you used to be. That is normal!   Also, to limit the amount of calories you eat right now is not such a good idea. When your body does not eat enough calories, it won't let you lose weight anyway! Besides, it is a proven fact that if anyone eats 1200 calories a day, and doesn't do a bit of exercise, they will lose weight. If you aren't losing weight, guess what? Your body doesn't have any weight to lose!       Something else to consider is to look at your parents. What are their heights and weights? What kind of bodies do they have? You might look at them and think about how your body is supposed to look, not what the media or people tell you, but how nature actually designed you to look!       Muscle always weighs more than fat, so if you have a lot of muscle tone in your body, then you will weigh more but actually be slimmer. Right now you should not make too much out of this, other than to think about eating healthy, eating enough, (not overeating here, but I don't think you have that problem) and exercising.       I think it is great that you want to be healthy, but please don't get into your mind that there is anything wrong with your body right now. I promise what you see is just a normal part of developing into a healthy adult.|`|RsOuzdohaa	But you're a good weight..|`|F1ZwUmzYaa	Already eat healthy my ***.    A piece of fruit for breakfast? Lets see, a apple is around 65 calories, so a slice would be what, 5-10 calories? Yeah, that's not going to get you far.    Eat more in the morning like 2 servings of a cereal (2 servings of Special K Vanilla Almond is 220 calories) and a 1/2 cup of 1% milk, which adds up to 275 calories, you'll burn it off later in the day.    Your lunch is a bit..bad? Eat a 300 calorie meal.    How much is that? 575 calories for half the day!    Now have a granola bar, a 100 calorie one.    Now, eat a good dinner around 425 calories.    That in total is 1000 calories, and since a normal human being shouldn't have LESS than 1200 calories, have a bananas or 2 small apples or just a 100 calorie granola bars, like Special K, which is only 90 calories.    Make sure to eat every 2-3 hours.    Don't have too much fatty foods, and only around 20g of Saturated fat every day.|`|rrioRncRaa	i am 13 as well and i started out want to lose about 15-20 lbs. i wanted to look good in a bikini. i started out eating healthy, but then got sick of it and went back to normal eating. then i made myself go on a strict diet. i limited myself to 1000 calories at the most, just like you. i developed the beginning stage of anorexia, not allowing myself to go over 1000 calories. i soon lost my period, my mother became worried, and i am afraid of eating certain foods, like pizza, candy. stuff that kids should be eating! i definately lost the weight. it came off quick, within a month or so. but seriosuly, you need to eat mroe. i am trying my hardest to get to 1200 calories. if you wanna lose it safely and not be like me then make sure you get 1200 calories a day.|`|ClktnBBdaa	You need to be eating a lot more than 1000 calories because you're still growing, you don't want to stunt your growth. Instead of losing "weight", try losing fat and toning up - record your measurements (waist and hips) rather than how much you weigh. Exercise 3 - 4 times a week, both cardio and weight training. Weight training will help you a LOT with toning up.    If you're worried about eating too much, fill up on wholegrains, veggies, fruit and fresh meat rather than deli meat. Deli meats have a lot of salt and can make you retain water, so you'll seem heavier than you actually are. The fibre from fruits and vegetables help you feel full and are good for your digestive system.    Lastly, to lose weight safely you need to do it slowly! at 121 lbs you don't have that much to lose, so you may find that you lose a bit slower than heavier people anyway.|`|wJoMKfvqaa	you are at a healthy weight. don't try to lose any.|`|JCk7F2NWaa	dont even worrying about that ...excersie to young can be bad for you

Some Facts:  Each day 3,000 children smoke their first cigarette.    At least 3 million adolescents are smokers.    Tobacco use primarily begins in early adolescence, typically by age 16.    Almost all first use occurs before high school graduation.    20 percent of American teens smoke.    Roughly 6 million teens in the US today smoke despite the knowledge that it is addictive and leads to disease.    Of every 100,000 15 year old smokers, tobacco will prematurely kill at least 20,000 before the age of 70.    Of the 3,000 teens who started smoking today, nearly 1,000 will eventually die as a result from smoking.    Adolescent girls who smoke and take oral birth control pills greatly increase their chances of having blood clots and strokes.    According to the Surgeon's General, Teenagers who smoke were:   Three times more likely to use alcohol.   Eight times are likely to smoke marijuana.   And 22 times more likely to use Cocaine.   Although only 5 percent of high school smokers said that they would definitely be smoking five years later, close to 75 percent were still smoking 7 to 9 years later.    A person who starts smoking at age 13 will have a more difficult time quitting, has more health-related problems and probably will die earlier than a person who begins to smoke at age 21.    Kids who smoke experience changes in the lungs and reduced lung growth, and they risk not achieving normal lung function as an adult.    Kids who smoke have significant health problems, including cough and phlegm production, decreased physical fitness and unfavorable lipid profile.    If your child's best friends smoke, then your youngster is 13 times more likely to smoke than if his or her friends did not smoke.    More than 90 percent of adult smokers started when they were teens.    Adolescents who have two parents who smoke are more than twice as likely as youth without smoking parents to become smokers      Plus- It is very unattractive. A lot of guys dont want to date someone with stinky smoke breath.|`|HA2IV3r3aa	I think you should to support American businesses.

Your mom just sounds realistic.  My mom never promoted me drinking or smoking but there's really only so much you can do.  I was against smoking cigarettes until on trip down to San Diego right outta HS.  I smoked there (while drunk) and started to really like it.. Now it is almost 4 years later and I can barely drive in my car without lighting up, or drink without going for a smoke break, or skipping a meal without a cigarette.  I haven't had a cigarette since b4 xmas 2008 (except for a little slip-up last night, I had like 4 puffs).  I wish I never had tried it to begin with.  I know HS is hard and all you want to do is fit in, believe me, I was there, I understand, and you will put your health in harms way just to get there.  But it's really not that cool.. Being able to say, "Yeah, I've never smoked a cigarette for 18 years," was really cool to admit.  Now I can't.  The smell sticks to everything! Like my sweatshirts, my car seats, my hair, etc.  And since I have very mild asthma, it's gotten 10x worse since I started smoking cigarettes, like hard to breathe when exercising! (yikes!) I do know some people who tried it and hated it, and it just helped re-assure them to not smoke. But that isn't everyone! Lots of people try it and don't think it's a big deal, until wow! I've been smoking for 4 years! (like me!).  Then it's a shocker.  Plus it doesn't help with not getting wrinkles, like AT ALL.  The smoke/nicotine breaks down the collagen in your face, hands, fingers. (how disgusting!).    It's totally up to you, babe.. I just wanted to put in my two sense because I realllllllly wished I had never tried it.

And despite what you think, you can become addicted after your first try.  Just because your mom didn't like it and didn't do it again doesn't mean you will have that same reaction. I have friends who took their first cigarette at your age and are still smoking to this day (15 years later).    Smoking is gross. It'll make you cough.  It'll make you thirsty. But really... do not try it just because most of your friends are doing it. It's a silly excuse.     But really... if you are seriously considering it then I STRONGLY suggest you look up the long-term effects of smoking. Go to Google.com and just type in Dangers of Smoking and read up a little. THEN make your decision.    Smoking is a gross habit and you don't want to be stuck in that habit. If you can avoid it, I suggest you do.|`|zzrBjrShaa	Don`t be like your friends.

Shes dying because of smoking. I unlike her have never had a cigarette in my life and I'm 15. I recommend that you DONT try just one. Just one could lead to 2, then 3. And soon enough you could be unfortunate like my aunt, and dying in the hospital.|`|62NCGgMwaa	It is the age to be curious.     The fact that you "just wanna see what its like" makes you that much more suseptable to becoming addicted however. from my personal experience those of us who "wanted to see what it was like" and tried it, were those who tended to start smoking....me as a great example. My first cigarette was at age 14 right after 8th grade.    My friends who weren't quite as curious, were those who carried on to not smoking.    Of course there are many other factors into addiction as well, heredity, genetics, stress, surrounding friends, etc.     What this ultimately comes down to is whether or not you want to take the chance (there is no guarantee, just a chance) that you will get addicted. If you believe you have stronger will power than that, and still want to try, go for it.     But remember, there is always that CHANCE that you could become addicted to cigarettes.     I've been battling with my addiction since that first puff I took, though it took me a while to admit i was indeed addicted.    Last night, after 6.5 years I took a stand, and quit. It will not be easy. It will not be fun.    The decision is yours, but coming from a smoker, I would suggest don't try it. It's not worth the battle of trying to overcome it.|`|8d22f5504b495a1272f4ea02029d04f7aa	wtf for....damn I'm sorry but you are STUPID!    go ahead and give me a thumbs down for stating my opinion!  & see if i care lol|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	It won't kill you to try it. It really has no point, but at least you'll be able to say you "tried it once". If that's important to you..|`|PauslbY0aa	try it once to see what its like. you prolly will choke and gag and cough..and never want another... but please dont become another smoker. very unattractive|`|xxSGhywoaa	why not.  it's your lungs it's your mind, it's your body.|`|LDSL0DUiaa	No, dont!|`|rkp6VmVaaa	dont do it my sister started to smoke the same way as u n now she smells bad n she is getting addicted its not good n dont try|`|dRWDV6Rlaa	not the best idea to smoke at such a young age :]|`|MEkhNYcOaa	Nope!|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Curiosity can get the best of us at times, but if you really want to try it, then go for it.|`|v7W8yBP7aa	even if you dont think you will it is super easy to get addicted so i dont reccomend it i only tried one puff then 2 then i started smoking and it was really hard to quit so if you want to be healthy then dont. smoking cause cancer of the mouth, throat, lungs and more - plus emphysema and nasty bad breath and yellow teeth plus you will waste all your money on ciggarettes. you can make your own decision though so good luck with whatever you do just be careful =) hope this helps|`|kAblN2YTaa	dont do it i satarted when i was 13 and im now 18 and kicking me self in the butt for starting i cant quit and i hate it! plus i spend over 100 dollars a month buying them its stupid if you have a half a brain dont do it
DIRbVD5uaa	Its a diet that works with your blood type  For Example  People with Blood type X have low stomach acid and therefore Should not Eat Dense foods  Something Like That.  There is A Type O Blood Diet but im Not 100% where to find it.  Try Google or Ask  Look around, its Probably hard to find Because Type O is Kinda Rare.
zQbvVtgsaa	See your doctor and explain this to her/him. You may need birth control pills, or your ovaries may be bulging in which case the doctor'd need to give you medicine. If you feel comfortable, go to an gynecologist. Don't freak out about this, but don't let it go untreated. One question: are you a virgin? If you aren't, you might have civilis or something like that, so go immediatly to a doctor for treatment.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	You should visit a doc and talk about this.

It doesnt sound normal to have pain down there when your standing with no tampon.. If your to scared to go the doctor maybe ask your mum or a close friend to help you make an appointment. :)
tS9epPiyaa	Hi Caitlin.....Trust me with this one general statement: Do EVERYTHING you can including talking to people in each of the three areas you listed before making a decision.  I found out the hard way and went into Pharmacy/Pharmacology without investigating all that much first.  Although I made it, I HATED the profession, but stuck it out until making a gutsy move to get involved in teaching instead of practicing.  Anyway, back to YOU!! .......One thing to consider is how the job growth is expected to be in each area.  For Diagnostic Sonography, check out http://www.healthguideusa.org/careers/di...  For Radiation Therapist, I found this site informative;  http://www.allcareerschools.com/career-c...  For Nuclear Medicine Technologist, I found two good sites:  http://www.collegegrad.com/careers/proft...  and  http://careers.collegetoolkit.com/career...  I know people working in all three of these areas and can tell you the one person working in sonography, hates her job.  She finds little room for advancement and same-old, same-old every day. The two people I know who work in Nuclear Medicine technology both like their jobs.    If your school can arrange for you to shadow an employee in each field for a few days, that would be a plus.  The issue I encounter with that, is possible violations of HIPAA (privacy concerns).   May I ask why you would not want to be a physician or Certified Nurse Practioner?  Demand is through the roof in all area of nursing at or above a RN.  CNP with specialties in anesthesiology are paying big bucks.  My other suggestion is to have the peace of mind that if and when you get a position in one of these areas, let's say for a major teaching hospital, they will often pay your tuition should you decide to make a change, provided you commit to them for "x" number of years in return.  If **I** had to pick one of the three you listed, I'd go with Nuclear Medicine Technology.  Personally, I believe it offers the most dynamic evolving opportunities with a solid profession.  But that's just me.  What matters most is what YOU feel you could do and LIKE doing it.  Last piece of advice:  While you may be 100% sure you want to go into one of these three areas, ask yourself, "If I could be in any profession tomorrow, what would it be and why?"  ALWAYS follow your dreams.  Best of everything to you and I'm glad you're investigating this before hand.  That shows a lot of maturity and intelligence.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.|`|dKG9URHBaa	This might be helpful. The future on medicine is in the direction of Stem Cells. There are breakthroughs almost every week. Now that Obama is going to reverse all of Bush's Executive Orders on stem cell research this will take off like never before.

46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	I was in a similar situation.     I have scoliosis (upper curve fused to T-12, lower curve not fused, but stable in the 40s). Pregnancy  1, I worked full time as a nurse until 1 mo. before delivering. Pregnancy  2, I was chasing my younger baby around (they are just 14 mo. apart).     Both pregnancies, I never let back pain slowed me. Talk with your OB about taking Tylenol (almost all allow it) and heat vs. cold therapy (most will so ok to warm showers or baths, but NO hot tubs, and will ok cold packs to the back).  These worked for me.    You can ask them about prenatal massage.  I didn't care for it, but other women love it.  See if they recommend anyone.  Most reputable massage centers will have people able to do prenatal massage.    Also ask about prenatal yoga classes.  I would have tried it, but didn't know we had a place in my city until after I'd given birth.  Many of the the places that offer prenatal yoga will also have classes for moms with kids.    Good luck!|`|c68nVKIYaa	Being pregnant alters your posture, and scoliosis is to a great degree a malposture problem. Often the pregnancy itself helps resolve scoliosis pain temporarily, but then you may have worse problems after birth, especially when lifting or carrying a child, laundry, and so on.     I would search the web for a specialist in Schroth physiotherapy. This is a treatment that uses exercises, among other techniques, to derotate your spine and re-establish normal posture. The Schroth method will soon resolve your pain problems if the therapist really knows what she is doing.
Xl0m5mjkaa	use a metal nailfile cos theyre thin, and put it between your face and hand and cut through the glue, it might take away some skin so be sure to put clingfilm on it straight away after your hand is removed from your face to stop air getting to it, it wil also stop the pain, then see a dr.|`|0HxFBueraa	Must have been really hard typing that up with one hand|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	See a Dr...|`|AQmcmW6paa	Oh wow, I can see we have a genius here!!|`|K6fasl6kaa	try not to be too embarassed at how ridiculous this is.|`|550c5a53b855405bd99bf0a3d4eb1075aa	Wow...how did that happen?|`|VOccyg7daa	How did you type your question?

1nINGDC7aa	Keep taking medicines. The antibiotics start having effect from 3rd day. The waiting will not ruin your tooth as infection has already set in. Most probably you will need root canal treatment. For more on that you can read the following... http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...
fLdEOmPVaa	First mistake was that you went to the hospital and did not follow up with a dermatologist.  That's the first thing you should do.  Make him an appointment with a dermatologist.    This condition could be any number of things and no one here, even a doctor, can diagnose this condition without seeing it firsthand.|`|fpDWtmJ0aa	Go to the dermatologist.   He could have serious eczema or something more serious.   Don't ignore it though.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Go back to the doctor. He could have very dry skin. Is it itchy?   You really should go see a doctor. The one you went to see sounds like a real dumbass.
KyAjmaOyaa	Hey, don't feel sad buddy!.. You got us here, and if you need help we can help you out with anything. Don't worry.. You know everyone has these sad days, some people cry it out, others listen to music, watch a funny movie, sleep, or do something else fun. I've been a sad person in school, but after realizing that a lot of other people are like me, it kind of makes me feel better that I'm not alone having hard times. Let me tell you one thing though, killing oneself is a really bad thing to do.. you have to think about your family. It would be pretty selfish to do that, and break their hearts. Hey fella, you should be happy that you have reached this far, be proud of yourself. You will be successful in life, it will only take time. And don't worry even if you hate yourself here, we will still love you here.. I'm all open to hearing whatever you would like to tell me. I would be more than happy to help you out..  God Bless You!|`|lMHy05Lmaa	dont hate your self say good things about your self and you will feel better|`|AA11828525	Talk to someone who'd cheer you up.

I find watching movies like Shrek or love actually work for me. But i think that doing anything that used to make you happy when you were little should work. Or get out of the house off the computer and go for a walk and get your endorphin levels up :) cheer up
FTRs5w3eaa	It could be caused my anything. Most likely its because the membranes in your sinus cavity are dry. It happens to my husband very frequently, especially in dusty areas, extreme cold, as well heat.     Any type of nasal spray should do the trick. But remember, if you think you are losing an excess of blood and/or nasal sprays dont help, contact your doctor or a nurse advisor through your local hospital.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Your mucus membranes are dry.  Cold weather can cause this.  Try saline nasal spray or vaseline in the opening to add moisture.

5f5bdda9f22a52bc94cd6a38f328275daa	Most adult bladders can hold anywhere between 16 and 32 ounces, depending on the person and the situation.  They do vary quite a bit between individual people in my experience.    Mine can hold about 10 ounces (a little more than 8, but not much...) and if I don't wake up to empty it during the night, I wet my bed... so yeah, my guess is that most adult bladders can hold more.|`|605688a34fb9f9adf2785024aac73c00aa	I'm sure most bladders can hold more than 8 ounces!

Once before school,once after school,and once before bed.|`|kM9xoajHaa	i bush my teeth twice day|`|1nINGDC7aa	You should brush atleat twice a day, once at bed time and once after breafast with proper brushing technique. For more on proper brushing technique you can read the following very informative article... http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|R5LuKSUXaa	I brush at least twice a day.  I try to brush after meals too.  Bad teeth run on my dads side of the family..i don't want none!!|`|5jf5tcMnaa	It depends.  If I have only 3 meals, then I will brush about 4 times.  If I have a slurpee in the afternoon and a snack in the evening, then it may be 5 times.  I brush after any snack or meal that would have sugar in it and I brush once before bed.  And I floss before brushing before bed.  I can count on two hands the number of times in my life that I have not flossed in a day since I was about 8 years old.  By the way I am 44 and I have never had a cavity.    COME ON PEOPLE!!  Why are you brushing your teeth??  Bacteria on your teeth use sugar from a meal for their own purposes but give off acid.  Within 30 miniutes of finishing a meal, you will see a decrease in the pH of a person's mouth.  That means the acids are being given off.  Those acids eat through the enamel and into your teeth.  The idea of brushing os to get rid of the sugar and bacteria within 30 minutes of a meal to prevent this acid attack.  Brushing after the acid release is as good as not brushing at all.  Look at Mary Alice J.  When she brushes has nothing to do with when she eats, but when she has the time from school.  Get some dental insurance Mary....you will need it!
8j7FCEOraa	Lotion  Lotion  Lotion!    Put some Polysporn on it too help it heal quicker  And actually, lip chap is a great moisturizer. Buy one for your nose, it'd be alot easier to carry around    And actually, splurge and get those tissues with lotion in them. Puffs? You can get them from Wal-Mart. I even got a box that had vix on them. Worked wonders. The smell uncloged my nose and it was so soft I never got the rodoulh after effect.|`|ScaAyzKHaa	A little Neosporin on a q-tip should help, just rub it along the inside of your nose so it doesn't get dried out. Otherwise the skin may crack and bleed, which is no fun. :(|`|xEa86Bb6aa	Try using soft tissues and put Vaporub in your nose every night it actually works!
RXI8ImdIaa	It's likely that you are building muscle. Muscle weighs more than fat, AND it burns fat faster!    When you start working out, it is normal to *gain* some weight initially due to muscle development. After that phase, you start losing weight at a much higher rate than you would have without the muscle.    Don't automatically react by eating less... give it several more weeks to see what happens.    Keep up the good work!      Edit: also remember that your main goal should not be a number on the scale - it should be a good percentage of body fat in proportion to your total weight. Lean muscle mass is not to be considered overweight, no matter what the scale says.|`|ssbKJ6fCaa	your not doing anything wrong muscle weighs more than fat so your gaining muscle hence weight stays the same but later you will see a difference =]|`|JC3rT6Qraa	your loosing fat and gaining muscle|`|jBgEgMybaa	i agree... your losing fat but gaining muscle which weights more.    same situation right here.    try judging your wegith loose (by the scales obviously) but more so and how your clothes fit. if theyre getting looser your losing cm and thats the main thing.|`|553ac7b7fe128bda796c55a6cfb5544daa	If you eliminate all sugar, salt and fat, drink water, eat 2-3 oz. protein and 1 cup of vegetables (six times per day, 2.5-3 hours apart), and walk for at least an hour (as fat burning is in effect after 25 minutes), you will probably have better success.    Best of luck.
T3Tywywzaa	OMG i had the same problem and am now using certain dri. it works MIRACLES. those "clinical strength" things dont work for me....plz try this i saw results like 2 days after i started. you put it on when you go to bed and then ur reg deoderant in the morning. let me know if it helps!!!!    ~good luck!!!!!!!!|`|kbdkOPHDaa	how old are you? i used to have that problem but i grew out of it. puberty does that... its ok.|`|22484220fe345327ce27dfdc71ad9a95aa	what works best for me, no matter what deodorant or antipersperant i use.. put it on at night, because that way it soaks better into your skin preventing sweat marks the next day.

XL9CUrp2aa	I guess it would depend on where you go.  I am not sure if they even card for things like that, but you can order them online at drugstore.com, or if you go to a discount store they may not check.  I think major stores and grocery stores would definitely check but ordering them online or going to lower class stores would be ok.  Make sure you read up on any of the pills you are planning on taking.  I took some that made my heart beat so fast I though I was having a heart attack and had to stop taking them, but I took the Alli pills and I was fine.    And if you did go up there and they said that, just smile and say "oh really, I didn't realize" and walk away.  I am sure that happens all the time, nothing to be embarassed about.|`|BwDdJp5aaa	Why would you want to?  Even though pills aren't approved by FDA we know that they work but you have to read the fine print. Something along the lines of, "Results no typical", or "Results will vary."  The before and after pictures are of people monitored nearly the whole time they are on the pills. That means they are given a specific meal plan and personal trainer.  If you are trying to become thin, then look at the Eastern cultures. They don't take pills, they walk everywhere or ride bikes and don't eat fast food. The main diet of Eastern cultures is fruits and vegetables. I lived in Japan for 5 years. I've had first hand accounts with the culture. Although meat is becoming used more as the main portion also heart disease and being overweight is rising too within the group that eats meat more.  Try running and staying active and watch what you eat. Hungry? Try an apple.
YQk8zW6caa	eating better is a must, i do NOT belive in diets at all cause it just not logical. i say just cut out fatty foods and limit yourself to 3 meals aday with 2 snaks   but if you want to lose weight, go for a run, running is cardio and burns fat if you dont see resaluts in a month dont worry it takes roughly 6 weeks for you to notice.|`|hfNXDCPQaa	The Diet For Teenagers Only. Buy the book. I have already lost ten pounds.|`|gH7wqHrdaa	The key for losing weight is easy - consume less and move more often - the issues surface when we actually try to put that into operation! There are a lot of temptations in the real world aren't there?! The one method which definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials left, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I shed twenty pounds, it definitely does produce results!|`|BwDdJp5aaa	I guessed your height to be 5'2". With that height, don't get too scared, you are considered obese. The good news is that you only have to lose 49 pounds to be in the normal range.  A life style change is needed immediately. My opinion would be to eat only fresh whole fruits and vegetables. Research has been show that not only will that way of eating make you lose weight safely but will also prevent or reverse diabetes, cardiac arrest, and possibly even cancer. Your body will also feel refreshed nearly all of the time.  DON'T EVER GO TO ANOTHER FAST FOOD JOINT AGAIN!

cf13fa7114cf17f7464b18592631a1f7aa	Just a few questions.    Could this also be a sympton of carpal tunnel?  Possible but unlikely.    Could using the computer/typing so much cause a nerve to pinch?  Yes!    Will this subside? You need to stretch more, and start taking Vitamin B6 capsules.  This is what was prescribed for my similar condition, and it worked.  The stretching helps some right away, the B6 takes time.  The B6 helps the nerve tissue repair itself.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	carpal tunnel yes and may go away or you may need surgery to unblock the nerve|`|9Exa61okaa	I don't know anything about carpal tunnel, so I can't really help you there.

This happened with my sciatic nerve in my back.  It hurt right where my kidney was but I found out it was a nerve by stretching a certain way that made it feel amazing.|`|fLdEOmPVaa	Numbness and tingling is a clear indication that this is something nerve related.  Considering you spend so much time on the computer I would think this to be carpal tunnel syndrome.  But to be 100% certain that what you are experiencing is carpal tunnel and not, persay, a pinched nerve in the vertebrae you will need to make an appointment with a Neurologist.    Carpal tunnel is simple to treat. Go to your nearest pharmacy and see if they have a simple wrist splint.  Wear the splint at night and see if any of the symptoms are relieved.|`|CJvJVNbdaa	sounds more like carpal tunnel than a pinched nerve should contact your doc to schedule nerve conduction study for a diagnosis|`|3YfYWpAsaa	thats carpal tunnel, and you spend way too much time on the computer.

The best advice I can give you is see a doctor if you are concerned and then stop having sex until you are older and ready to handle the consequences.|`|rymcm91Oaa	First of all, you probably aren't pregnant. The linea negra (dark line from pubic bone...) doesn't show up until later in pregnancy. The nipples dont really darker until around the 2nd trimester. And the breast tenderness is also a sign of your period.    Cloudy urine is not related to pregnancy...it is an indication of a UTI. I would drink plenty of water and prolly go get some antibiotics because UTI's are not fun if they get any worse.|`|C0LZRO2Laa	Okay well a couple things.    First of all sometimes you get cloudy urine from drinking not enough water and sometimes from drinking a little more than enough.    Second of all when my cousin would breast feed her baby, you could see that from pregnancy the area around her nipple was brown.    Third of all don't have sex until your old enough to actually have a child just in case.    So, in conclusion you should take a pregnancy test a couple of times so you can get an accurate test, and if needed go to a doctor immediately.

0rpN2419aa	I have IBS, but I also have upper digestive pain, that hurts and burns from the top of my navel, to where my ribs meet at the top and through to my back.  The pain was so bad sometimes, I used an ice pack to ease the pain and nausea.  It was affecting me more severely than it does now as the Dr. gave me a prescription.  I have several more conditions going on that contribute to my tummy problems.  I had an endoscopy done and they found erosions in my esophagus and upper stomache.  I also have gall stones and need to have them removed, however a pre-existing condition makes surgery a little more seious for me...Addison's disease, which I am sure your mom doesn't have.  She needs to get a second opinion at a Gastroenterologist or an Endocronologist.  I have to see both.  Did they do the endoscopy procedure?  I hope that the source of her symptoms are found soon.  I know how horrible that pain can be.  Some times I groaned and Chuck ask me what I said.  I finally had to tell him to not ask, I'm just groaning.  If the pain is burning, an ice pack might help.  If she is out in public she can put the ice pack in a tote bag and put it on her lap.
kogsyGAPaa	Have you eaten something different at all? Since it's at night it might because your stomach has emptied and it is getting upset from a day of eating... Was the bleeding regular? I could be implantation, but since you described it as your period, my guess is not. You could either have some sort of bug going around that is making your stomach more queezy and sensitive, that would be my guess.    Hope you feel better!

Also sometimes, my mom will have come into my room and its startled me awake and Ive started talking nonsense|`|eCngkejDaa	AHAHAH! Normal beyond belief, my friend.

LDMV3WUTaa	YOU could always try wearing multiple condoms, at the same time. To NOT allow your penis to receive SO MUCH stimulation. Because orgasms, can be achieved as a combination of mental stimulus, and physical stimulus. So if YOU wear something to inhibit the amount of simulation YOU are receiving physically, then ALL YOU would have to worry about, is how excited YOU get, mentally, during the act of sex.|`|hoGfJXWfaa	jack off before you have sex, and please your girl first.. that should make it last much longer.. hope i helped..

In the short term, you can try masturbating before you have sex, which should help.  You can also try the start/stop method (stop when you're close to orgasm, wait a little, start going again).  There's also creams and such that can desensitize and that can help you last longer though they aren't very popular because you lose a lot of the pleasurable feeling.    In the long term, look up kegel excercises and give those a go to help you last.|`|YZ3RbfVvaa	Have you tried kegel exercises. They aren't just for women, I've heard they work for men and can help with better orgasms and lasting longer. Actually when I met my boyfriend he always came really fast and now he's much better about it and I believe he practices kegel exercises as well, actually I can tell he does when we are having sex or when I'm giving him oral. Just do a google search on it. There are plenty of videos/articles explaining them. They are also useful for multiple orgasms...They aren't extremely fast working but they'll definitely help. Also I'm sure you're partner will understand if they really care about you and they'll appreciate that you're trying to last longer.

x3PLREEuaa	Due to their fundamentally good natures, the Dukes often wound up helping out Boss Hogg, albeit begrudgingly. More than once Boss was targeted by former associates who were either seeking revenge or had turned against him after a scheme unraveled in any number of ways: Boss' greedy nature, Rosco's bumbling, the criminals simply outsmarting the two or their consciences came to the surface. Sometimes criminals who were even more crooked and ruthless than Boss came to town. Sheriff Rosco also found himself in trouble more than once. On such occasions, Bo and Luke usually had to rescue their adversaries as an inevitable precursor to defeating the bad guys; these instances became more regular as the series went on.

I actually feel like this is the modern day snake oil.  The body is more than capable of riding it's self of the toxins it needs easily and appropriately.  It's taken evolution, or a heavenly being depending on your beliefs.  Thousands of years to develop of body that can handle riding toxins as needed.  So the belief that we need to purge this toxins through other means I believe is just ways to get money out of people.   As far as a colon cleanse the best one I know of it fleets phososoda that we use for colonoscopy procedures.  This should only be used for the clearing for that procedure though.    If you just eat well and have plenty of fiber in your diet you well be fine.

a0CjOWVhaa	HEY OMG I"M THE EXACT SAME HEIGHT AS YOU!  but anyways i hadn't worked out for a while and was in bad shape until 3 days ago.  I'm trying out for my track&field team and it's really rigorous.  I wouldn't recommend not working out for a while and then suddently start running like me, unfortunately my legs are realy sore and i can barely run which means i have to miss a couple days of practice.  I would recommend you to run a while around your block (warmup or stretch first of course). Or if you can't do that run on your treadmill, or if you can't do that either, start each day with a routine like a couple of jumping jacks (stretch first), some crunches, then run around your house and time yourself. (you can do this when your home alone).    Just turn on your music in your house really loud. start from your room and round around your house and jog down your stairs and race back up. if you fall or something no one will notice because YOUR INSIDE!  try it!|`|1s6mQJqOaa	It might be because you are too think! I jog everyday works almost every part of your body! Good luck!|`|OB2JbmFcaa	There is a principle called, FITT. It stands for:  Frequency  - How often you exercise  Intensity - How hard you exercise  Time - How long you exercise  Type - What type of activity/exercise you are doing    Also, the minimum amount of exercise you should do is 3 days a week for 30 minutes. And when you're working out, stop for a sec and count your pulse for 6 seconds and then add a zero to the end and see if you're at you training heart rate zone. When you are at the gym, you should walk on the treadmill for about 2-4 minutes then start running for about 20 minutes. And everyday, you should increase the time you run. Good luck~   If you have any questions, don't hesistate to email me.  And never give up - always reach your goal.|`|zI6cZoAWaa	join a sport that interests you|`|6c1tDSqqaa	Always start out small.

You will get fit fast with kettlebells or exercises like it. And if you stop, it's easy to get back into it.    They are the best way to get strong and toned. You will lose weight, look great, and feel strong. Your strength will be practical, meaning instead of only being able to use your muscles for lifting weights, you'll be able to use your muscles to lift household objects, climb stairs, be more agile, the list goes on and on. Here's a list of reasons why to do kettlebells: http://kettlebells4u.blogspot.com/2008/1...    Here's a resource for kettlebells, and articles about what they can do for you: http://www.dragondoor.com/articler/mode2...    Here's a resource for finding a kettlebell trainer near you: http://www.dragondoor.com/instructors.ht...    Here's a bunch of videos of how to do some kettlebell exercises. Try doing them while holding something that's heavy, but not a kettlebell, since you probably don't have access to bells. You can't do the swing without a bell. http://www.youtube.com/user/kettlebells4...    Check out this video in particular. If you can master this technique, even doing it without weight, or while holding something like a can of soup, can be a good workout - do 3 reps on each side. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rAQ0pcxW...    For something you can do that's LIKE kettlebells, if you can't afford the real thing, read up on Pavel Tsatsouline, Naked Warrior, and other strength training techniques. Check out this link, and use the links on the sidebar on the left to explore articles by people just like you and me who have gotten stronger like this! http://www.dragondoor.com/    Why do anything else, when you can do kettlebells? Your core will be stronger and more toned, and you will strengthen and trim all your muscles. You will look and feel great. And you can do it in no time at all.    For real. I did it just to try it out, and I fell in love!!|`|X9lIF4baaa	well if you're really out of shape you might want to take things slow, such as going for walks everyday and then later on go jogging|`|TqJk5cRLaa	running... swimming...jogging...the gym... playing Wii fitness...tennis... any sports...|`|tfsaxi0laa	Jogging... it's real hard on your lungs and the only way to get better is to just keep pounding at it.|`|bd9l7OSCaa	im about the same.

NWa45ZDIaa	Good question. I have a smaller longer head then average so a lot of my hats are too big. I think it depends on what kind of hat you have, but I've done 2 things that worked for me. On one brim hat I have I actually put a  soft thin sock around my forehead, it fit snugly & it made the hat more comfortable too. It didn't show. & I have one baseball type of hat or cap that was too big, its cloth, so I actually got a huge safety pin & pinned the back, like buckled it together, the pin is underneath & not visible. It works great!  Hope this helps. (But I do know what its like to not have hats fit, I wear a TON of hats, & I end up returning a lot of them because they're just to big. =o/    Not sure why you posted in Pain Management, you should repost this in the fashion category if you want more answers. =)

Rou1ihXoaa	Yes, you can definitely benefit from adding whey protein to your diet.  You should try and consume at least 1 gram of protein per lb of body weight, per day.  Whey can come in handing if you are short on your diet, or don't have enough time.|`|RKMgokm6aa	I would try eating other healthy foods and incorporate whey protein supplements into your daily diet as well. There is no substitute for whole foods.    Also, workout. Your body isn't just going to place muscle fibers onto your chest and arms because you eat more protein. You need stimulus.|`|YgjAXcm3aa	To be safe i should say no, if you look into it diets usually never work.  if you want to lose weight and gain muscle you SHOULD eat a variety of foods rich in protein and low in trans fats. it is not wise to eat mainly whey. but it is still recommended that you eat a diet rich in grains as well as the protein. you should continue to work out and perhaps eat a larger amount of simple carbohydrates for a higher ATP count.  APT (Adenosine Phosphate) allows the process of cell division to go more smoother and you'll eventually build more muscle because the ATP allows you to...well its hard to explain but..you can like sprint longer without running out of energy... its basically like giving your body a higher gear to kick into.  another thing you should think about is a substance called Cretin.  Cretin is also like the simple carbs and gives your body a HUGE ATP count. The best thing to do is eat a multitude of the 5 food groups and consider the Cretin.

At this point, you could pass out at any time, so don't waste a minute, and don't drive. Tell someone to pick it up for you.

W1tx1p2iaa	Surgery only works if they know exactly where the obstruction is. If it is your tonsils or nasal polyps, surgery works well.  If it is farther down the respiratory track, surgery works less than 50 percent of the time.  Some people just have floppy airways.    Really get a few opinions of surgery before making any discussions.  Go to sleepnet.com.  These message boards are strictly for sleep apnea.
f8mLpPXlaa	The metered dose inhaler(MDI) is undiluted albuterol or whatever bronchodilator. The nebulizer treatments dilute the medicine with saline to carry the medicine deeper into your lungs. The saline also acts as as mucolytic (thins out the mucous).   The MDI is used in an emergency to get a brochodilator opening up your lungs ASAP. The treatments are very important also as they help loosen the thick mucous associated with asthma or COPD or other pulmonary conditions. After an exacerbation of asthma or COPD or bronchitis, etc. treatments are given to enhance the other medicine your doctor is giving you.|`|ac1824875bd5b0235707e90dd22614ecaa	some people with copd, such as myself, find the nebulizer gets deeper into the lungs and works better for them|`|ikbHM3tUaa	MDI - metered dose inhaler. This is the typical inhaler you see everyone using for asthma etc. Nebulizer - this is a solution which is put through a nebulizer machine and converted to a very fine mist then inhaled, the consistency is kindof like steam.     They absorption/effectiveness are the same for either. They are also both used for COPD and asthma. Generally speaking because the nebulizer machines are big and costly they aren't used in the community, and mostly are for hospitalized patients.

vGbTKA2Haa	"Because the anorexic are starving themselves, they tend to have numerous health issues, such as low blood pressure, brittle nails, and irregular heart rhythm. Because many anorexics also refuse to drink enough water, they can also experience kidney failure.    Not everyone who suffers with anorexia has the same symptoms, because all people are different. One of the first things to look for is having a body weight that is not consistent with their age and height. Another effect on their body will be an irregular menstrual cycle.     Other effects include psychological problems like anxiety, weakness, dry skin, and shortness of breath. Anorexics also tend to suffer from bone loss due to low food intake. This leads to stunted growth and development of osteoporosis. So the long term effects of anorexia last a lifetime.    One of the worst effects of anorexia includes death. As many as 15% of the people suffering from this disease actually die as a direct result of it, either by heart failure, kidney failure, or other organ failure. Many anorexics even commit suicide as a result of the conflicting emotional problems they suffer from."        I got that off the web but its pretty much true...     if u or someone u know are anorexic or even thinking about it you should get some help, cuz it sucks to be in that situation!! lol|`|9ilXVowLaa	rotten teeth and gums.  lose of menstrual cycle.  the  skin,in later stages,grows a thin white "fuzz".  kidney failure.  heart attack due to lack of potassium.  decrease in urine output and bowel movements.  the body will start to feed off of the muscles to fortify itself.    sounds fun,doesn't it?|`|dl0EpJPDaa	Unfortunately I'm at the other end of the spectrum.
TLPoyMUIaa	Not necessarily. Sometimes the baby teeth can look crooked or really spaced out. By the time the child's permanent teeth grow in, the jaw has grown bigger (giving more space) and the permanent teeth are larger too (filling in spaces), so some problems do fix themselves. Just keep yourself updated by asking the dentist how things look at regular visits.
8oRGz4Anaa	Many things can cause this. Some reasons could be and increase in stress levels, a change in diet, an increase in exercise.    Edit: Smoking doesn't directly affect it, but I think the smoking is causing you to eat less, which is affecting your period.|`|kMEG4tKVaa	well how long have you had ur period? most periods aren't regular for a year or two. also if ur under stress it will make it way late. and don't worry its normal. i sometimes skip a period so chillax stick in a tampon or wear a pad and enjoy not having your period for a while!|`|usb9nzJjaa	It could be a lot of reasons try to relax and make some parsley tea and wait.

6SJ8QHKcaa	No, ma'am, not totally!     It will always be in their minds!  Counseling surely helps, but as long as they have a memory, they will remember.  Their sex life, if they get married, will be like "a chore" for them.  It won't be a pleasing thing.    My heart aches for your children.  I don't even know them & I want to cry.  My prayers are with you & your children.  Get them to counseling, if they want to talk about it.  The  more love they are shown & the more they come to know God, the better chances they will have to find happiness & possibly have a normal life.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	I've gotten past the sexual and physical abuse i suffered from as a child. I still have the mental health problems it caused, but I dont fear that anymore.so i would say yes it is possible with time|`|lGSUToFQaa	i can tell you from a psychologist point of view or from a girl who was molested by her brother for 3 yrs, no you never really get over it, you learn to live with it and you learn to trust people again, it takes a lot of work and years, but eventually you get to the point where you don't think about it that much, just once in a while, you can let your children know they can always talk to you and make them feel safe and they will get over it so much easier than if they had to do it on their own. good luck|`|ETcBRko3aa	No, it is not possible to get over it.  It is possible to accept that it happened, release the shame, and learn to accept yourself.      Scientific studies have actually shown that trauma of this nature to children alters their brain, hence why the majority are diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).   You do not get over PTSD, because the brain has been altered by the stress of the trauma, but you learn to deal with the symptoms.|`|cx5Z5XEtaa	No, I think subconsciously we always know i have heard kids say they remember falling out of a crib at  18 mos  being dropped , 2 yrs of age horrific things and bad things? so i would suggest getting them in family counseling for monitoring.  avoid tv and movies that exhib sexual conitation this may trigger something in them i was a baby 6 mos old and i think i can remember my grandma, she died when i was 6 mos old , but what do i know??|`|7JEojMgQaa	I never did, not fully.|`|OKD0il7Iaa	I do not think that it will ever truly go away completely my wife was abused several years ago and still has problems with it.

Will they be able to function in society? hold normal jobs and have normal  relationships?     you should get them in therapy. don't try to handle this yourself- it doesn't matter how young they are... if they've been sexually abused get them into therapy as soon as you can so that they can deal with these things. they'll never fully move on and forget about it, but with therapy they will be able to function normally in society and not let it affect their relationships with other people.     If you don't get them help you're just asking for trouble. Kids wont forget these types of things. Whether they become aggressive with others or depressed and hate themselves... it will come out.

gIMZaY02aa	Good possibility you still have an infection of some kind, possibly an abscess.  You most likely also have decay on the tooth.    I don't know expenses in australia, but in the states dental work is really pricey.  It depends on what's wrong, and what needs to be done.  It's possible you'll need a root canal, which would probably be fairly expensive.    Definitely not something to ignore, though.  Dental infection can spread through your sinuses and into your brain.|`|jOUsDjfRaa	It may be a wisdom tooth, they hurt your ears.|`|1Sl45kHMaa	I believe the dentist will have to cover where it hurts. My husband was the same way when a dentist checked him out. There was a piece missing and he had a hole next to it. He needs to go back for a root canal... He said it's painful!|`|oCTMqI4haa	it's probably a root canal.  i had one and youre showing all the symptoms.    well, it's not too expensive, but its not going to be cheap either.    good luck! i had one, and it hurt like hellll .|`|nqOqaNIEaa	yea|`|I1wVybUYaa	i think you need to go to a dentist pronto it could need route canal and it sounds like it might be infected too|`|sLgI3cRpaa	it probably will be an expensive process|`|gpBicBEPaa	muffins taste good|`|xFRqtKr0aa	Does it look like the tooth is chipped away and at the same time is black? Could be a cavity. Which means you'll need an extraction (around $200 in the USA) and possibly a root canal (far more pricy)

People with your attitudes are nasty and need to grow up. You're not a doctor, and if you would've read properly, she saw a physician who has a bit better understanding of the human body and how it carries weight more so than you. Think before you speak next time or just stfu.    Dani, I really recommend doing a cardio workout at least 3 times a week, maybe for an hour, hour and a half each, and maybe walking moderately  or so days a week. Anything that gets your heart pumping.    The health section of MSN has a lot of things you might find useful, such as their calculators and articles : http://health.msn.com/weight-loss/|`|EPDi4Z1Iaa	I go by the philosophy of eat like a king at breakfast, a prince at lunch, and a peasant for dinner. It actually helps.  Also, do you have a show that you must watch everyday? If, there is you can run on your treadmill during the show. This way its not so boring and not so forced.|`|AA11938149	Hey Dani    Be smart - lose the weight slowly.  Make a lifestyle change or the weight will come back.  I've recently lost 35 pounds by going to Weight Watchers and Curves 3 or 4 times a week.  Eating sensibly works for long term loss.  And exercising - even just walking or dancing - anything to move your body for at least 30 minutes a day.    Good luck to you!  It can be done!|`|acyhxe8Paa	my moms a personal trainer and says that you really need to watch what you eat and NOT to weigh yourself everyday cause your weight can change daily. weigh yourself llike once a week. make sure when you workout you do something to get your heart rate up (like hiking or going for a walk with your friend) and lift weights (remember muscle weighs more than fat) and it will burn more calorines which means you can calories easier. good luck:))

DIRbVD5uaa	For me No  Its About the same as it is when you drink plain water or milk.
9KQwu3oUaa	1. Don't use always or kotex brand pads. They're so uncomfortable and don't really offer good protection. Stayfree is my favorite brand. For tampons, O.B. is the most efficient (but they don't have applicators).. so for a younger teen or first timer I'd recommend Tampax Pearl or Playtex Gentle Glide, even though they don't work as well.    2. yes, but I really wouldn't risk it. You could get a disease called Toxic Shock Syndrome which is deadly. Overnight pads are the best.     3. At first, yes. Your lining hasn't been shed before this, so the blood is older. My whole first period was brown. If you keep getting it every period, though, ask your mom or someone you trust.     4. I don't know, I don't use medicine. :/    5. there isn't a huge difference. You can use a regular tampon while playing sports or use a sport tampon for regular usage. Sport tampons tend to have less leakage problems and are designed for an active body. But like I said, it doesn't really matter.    good luck :D|`|3YJRqFGJaa	1 idk i dont wear pads but tampons would be playtex gentile glide or playtex sports any that r plastic applicators  2 yes  3 yes  4 mydol or tylenol  5 no difference between that and the playtex gentil glide its 360 and prevents leaking|`|r0ogb4xZaa	1. i like to use always extra-thin overnight. i like the overnight ones because they have the wings so they stick to your underwear. you can wear them during the day too    2. you can, but you really shouldn't    3. yes, it is normal. the brown is just more discharge. its esp. common during the first few periods    4. take what your mother or doctor tell you is best    5. idk the real difference. i can't really tell. it might be that the sport one is more comfortable, but i can't feel any differnce|`|529yXHW9aa	-ALWAYS  -YES BUT WATCH OUT  -YES IT NORMAL  -DON KNOW|`|KHic5rAaaa	1.  I like any super tampons or Tampax Pearl, but it honestly depends on how heavy or light your period is.  My period is never really heavy, but sometimes I'll bleed through my tampon.  It's really weird because I'll take my tampon out, thinking it's completely full and it won't be.  Sometimes I just don't fill up the entire tampon, yet I'll leak a little bit on my panties...strange!  You can also get a box of tampons that have a mixture of light, heavy, and moderate flow tampons.    2.  I do not recommend leaving a tampon in over night.  You should change your tampon every 4 hours because bacteria starts to fester, which is harmful to your health.  You can get toxic shock syndrome from this, so I would definitely play it safe and wear a pad overnight.    3.  Yes, it's completely normal to have a brown spotting.  A brown period just means that the blood is not as fresh as the red blood.  Sometimes you can have blood inside of you that doesn't necessarily come out right away.  Thus, you'll have brown blood when it finally comes out.  When I first got my period, my periods were very very light and I usually had brown spotting for awhile.  Eventually, your period will become more heavier and you'll have more red blood.    4. I usually don't take medicine for cramps, but if I need to, I take Midol.  Basically, you can take any medication, including Tylenol, if on the back is says for "cramping."    5.  I'm not quite sure what the difference between a "sport" tampon and a "regular" tampon, but I would assume the "sport" one is more wider and thicker, so you won't leak when you're constantly in motion.    Hope this helps and welcome to Womanhood! : )|`|DH4o26rIaa	1. I like the Always Infinity Pads because you don't have to change them all the time even if you have a heavy flow    2. Yes, you can keep a tampon overnight, but make sure you don't leave it in over 8 hours. Put it in right before you go to bed and take it out as soon as you get up.  If you sleep more than 8 hours, you can always change it during the night.    3. Yes, periods come in all different colors, don't worry    4.  Midol or Tylenol is the best for cramps. Advil makes your blood thinner, so it makes you bleed more.    5.  I think the only difference is that a sport is more comfortable if you are active and moving around a lot.     Hope I helped! Good Luck!!
p7ZdohGTaa	Do you really want a statistic? Like for a class or a paper, or are you actually comparing to yourself? Who knows how many in 1,000? Perhaps someone who did a study. But as far as ADHD, anxiety, ocd and at least problems sleeping, they can all go together. ADHD seems to have some clusters of symptoms, and sometimes ADHD people have trouble filtering out things that they find irritating. Sleep Apnea can be caused from weight, or chemical things going on in the brain. You could try a couple things to get these a bit under control. First, cut out all caffeine. Cut out all sugary things, soda pop, and wheat products. Try to up your protein intake (real meat, and not fried stuff), and fresh fruits and vegetables. Watch to see what happens. If this helps, great. If you need to, you can also see how removing dairy from your diet works. If these don't help, try to decide if you are under some specific pressure that is bothering you. But do try to eliminate these things, first. It may take 2 or 3 weeks to see the actual result, but it may be worth it. Look up ADHD and candida, or ADHD and food sensitivities, online.|`|1a42bf28fe11e609b0c68795bce43d6baa	about 1000 out of 1000. Those conditions are WAY over diagnosed. Most grow out of the symptoms.

f88077843121730d437a4c79a52d45c8aa	Taking Donatal is not going to stop a gall bladder attack.  For now drink lots of water and if you can get to a pharmacy or health food store purchase Lecithin capsules and take two of them with a large glass of water.  This cleans out the gallbladder.  this will help stop the pain very quickly.      As a general rule, the grain and cereal foods at the top of this list make the safest, easiest, and most versatile soluble fiber foundations for your meals and snacks. Also these have practically no fat.       Rice, Pasta and noodles, Oatmeal, Barley, Fresh white breads such as French or sourdough (NOT whole wheat or whole grain)* Rice cereals, Flour tortillas, Soy, Corn meal, Potatoes, Carrots, Yams, Sweet potatoes, Turnips, Beets, Squash and pumpkins, Mushrooms, Chestnuts, Avocados (though they do have some fat), Bananas, Applesauce, Mangoes, Papayas (also digestive aids that relieve gas and indigestion)    *Please choose a baked-daily, high quality, preservative-free brand. White bread does not mean Wonder.|`|grm23kvjaa	If the pain is that bad and reacts to not a lot of fat such as chicken broth, then go to the doc asap!  I had attacks like that and nothing would help.  Chances are you have gall stones and they may also cause pancreatitis which helps your body produce insulin.  I had mine out not long after I was at the doctor and was so relieved to be able to eat normal foods I loved.  Instead of an ultra sound, or x ray, ask for a Hida Scan right away it is the only thing that would show my gall bladder was not working right and if left in it would make me even sicker.  So go to your doc asap.
v9iUPLxfaa	Ok I am 27 and I know everything about this subject. Women NORMALLY discharge. It's not you ejaculating or "cumming" as people would say it. Girls normally have a discharge. I wouldn't say every day you will notice it, but some days are worse than others. You can even talk to a health teacher and she will tell you the same. I'm sure you see what looks like "***" sitting on your underwear as if you just did that but it's not that. I recently just took a Sex Ed class at my community college and this was one of the subjects. It is totally fine! There is nothing wrong with your vagina! hahaha and masturbation is totally natural. Anyone( who has gone through puberty and such) who says that they DON'T masterbate is LYING.|`|11d28a719b061143141cbe5fe883288caa	its fine dont worry instead learn some grammar|`|77NzfiVkaa	You used predominant wrong in that sentence.|`|3YJRqFGJaa	i did too its normal its just discharge|`|e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	That is just probably a discharge. It is normal when the body starts changing. If it is foul in odor, then there may be something wrong. It should never smell fishy, it should just smell like you naturally smell.    If you are masturbating, just make sure your hands are clean and soap free so that you wont irritate yourself.|`|AA11895447	You probably are not ejaculating, it's probably just vaginal discharge. Have you gotten your period yet? Your body may be getting ready for starting your meses. You also could just be regulating your period if you have had it already, and what you are feeling is the vaginal discharge coming out. At certain times of the month, it comes out a lot more than others, and it can feel like a female ejaculation.    Or, if an orgasm is accompanying this, it's just hormones. You're 15, and full of 'em right now so it could be just simply you're turned on, all the time.

You might want to look into the surgical options.    Diet and exercise methods usually lead to a loss of 1-2 pounds per week.  So in 4 months you could lose about 32 pounds through diet & exercise.  To lose the amount you want to lose and keep it off, give yourself a year or more.

xyWe7BFqaa	That varies a lot from person to person. Unfortunately, we live in a society that strongly discourages women from exploring their own bodies at all, let alone pleasuring themselves. Many girls take this to heart and don't experiment with masturbation until they are much older, if ever. However, some of us ignore this societal pressures and start masturbating at an early age. I started when I was 4 :) First orgasm at 10.
AA11522944	Redness and itching ''down there' is often caused by a fungal infection like 'jock itch'.    Most fungal infections are caused by moisture especially sweat.    If you have jock itch you can buy an anti-fungal cream like 'Hydrozole' from a chemist / drug store. Just walk in and ask for 'a broad spectrum anti-fungal cream for jock itch'.  They'll know exactly what to give you.  Don't be embarrassed... HEAPS of guys get it.    The key to avoiding jock itch is to keep the area dry.... make sure you always dry yourself properly after you bathe.    Wear underwear made out of absorbent natural fibres such as cotton and avoid wearing man-made fibres that dont breathe well like Lycra, or nylon, or elastane.    Never wear underwear to bed and preferably sleep naked.    ps Sleeping naked is not really essential... but it's good for you in HEAPS of ways :)    http://www.kidshealth.org/teen/infection...  http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art....|`|2TEIN3Z3aa	it could be stretch marks|`|xZsGpN9iaa	when u rub there does it have an odor or itch?  Could just be jock itch like athletes foot fungus.   If sounds like that then get some athletes foot antifungal medicine over the counter in pharmacy, then use medicated powder or store brand Tinactin powder also antifungal. Relief if itching or odor should only take couple days after that get seen in ER or family MD take care good luck! cp in CT|`|TsjqzanQaa	Go to the doctor.    Noone can diagnose this over the internet, and in this day and age, when we have drug-resistant infections like MRSA, it's advisable to get to the doctor quick, especially if it's spreading.    Not to scare you, but with the flesh-eating bacteria, and other infections, if it were me, I'd go to the nearest emergency room, and wouldn't be sitting and typing on the computer.    ERIC
ScLAUvYfaa	Classifying bacteria as either gram -ve or gram +ve tells you something about their cell walls: gram -ve organisms have an extra layer of polysaccharides, phospholipids and proteins around their cell walls.       Many beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin) can't get through this layer to attack the peptidoglycan wall (more specifically, to interfere in the process of making the cell wall), making them useless against g-ve bacteria.
d2zGNPUoaa	yuo can sleep with them in, its just not good to do it all the time. i do sometimes. just when you get up in the morning put them in your mouth for a couple seconds so they are wet. don't put them in water cause that will hurt. if you can just create some tears in the morning and that will help. but be sure to take them out for alittle bit in the morning. they will hurt becuase your eyes need to breath and with them on all night they can't.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	Well, it looks like you are stuck.    You can't put them in water, that is dangerous for infections, even if it doesn't make your lenses swell up.    Sooo, this will be a lesson to always have solution or at least your case with solution in it with you at all times when you are out.    You really don't have much choice but to just ditch them , and go without tomorrow until you get home.    If your Dr. specified not to even nap with them on, they proabably aren't a brand that you can sleep with , without possibly finding them stuck to your eyes in the morning.
ILVCgXcYaa	In the 1920s there were an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 cases of diphtheria per year in the United States, causing 13,000 to 15,000 deaths per year.[3] Children represented a large majority of these cases and fatalities. One of the most famous outbreaks of diphtheria was in Nome, Alaska; the 1925 serum run to Nome to deliver diphtheria antitoxin is now celebrated by the "Great Race of Mercy".    One of the first effective treatments for diphtheria was discovered in the 1880s by U.S. physician Joseph O'Dwyer (18411898). O'Dwyer developed tubes that were inserted into the throat, and prevented victims from suffocating due to the membrane sheath that grows over and obstructs airways. In the 1890s, the German physician Emil von Behring developed an antitoxin that did not kill the bacterium, but neutralized the toxic poisons that the bacterium releases into the body. Von Behring discovered that animal blood has antitoxins in it and so he took the blood, removed the clotting agents and injected it into human patients. Von Behring was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for his role in the discovery, and development of a serum therapy for diphtheria. (Americans William H. Park and Anna Wessels Williams; and Pasteur Institute scientists Emile Roux and Auguste Chaillou also independently developed diphtheria antitoxin in the 1890s.) The first successful vaccine for diphtheria was developed in 1913 by Behring. However, antibiotics against diphtheria were not available until the discovery and development of sulfa drugs following World War II.    The Schick test, invented between 1910 and 1911, is a test used to determine whether or not a person is susceptible to diphtheria. It was named after its inventor, Bla Schick (18771967), a Hungarian-born American pediatrician. A massive five-year campaign was coordinated by Dr. Schick. As a part of the campaign, 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company with an appeal to parents to "Save your child from diphtheria." A vaccine was developed in the next decade, and deaths began declining in earnest in 1924.[4]
P01h6jzAaa	first of all the boys that tell you that only light colored girls are pretty.   they're dumb. dont listen to anything they have to say.  some people just like to rain on your parade. mostly because they're insecure about themselves,so putting negative attention on someone else make them feel better. trust me, thats not true.   when you feel really pretty one day and not so pretty the next, well welcome to the life of any girl. it happens all the time. theres always something girls wish they could change about themselves. god made you the way you are for a reason, just remember that.  i would say first you have to tell yourself your beautiful, and carry that confidence with you where ever you go. because you are beautiful girl. dont let people tell you differently. everyone is insucure about themselves. when people tell you your pretty, they arent just saying that. use that to boost you up, knowing that other people think your pretty..is a good thing. and just proves my point.     hope this helps  and just remember, believe in yourself and have that confidence  even if you dont feel it, fake it  and other people will follow =]|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

Message me if you want tips on how to control your appetite a bit!   i'd be happy to have someone to talk about that kind of thing!  x|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	Because "Pro Ana's" are exploiting and glamorizing a serious mental disease.  It insults true anorexics to see people willingly doing this to themselves and bragging about it.  Pro ana's also seem to think they're better than anyone else because they have "self control".  But nope, sorry... you're just going to do this for a while and then you will start having uncontrollable binges.  Soon you will give up and gain more than you lost.  Believe me, I'm a true anorexic and "Pro ana" isn't anorexic.  Anorexia is a horrible disease and you DON'T want it!    I also have known a few "pro ana's" or as the rest of the world calls them "wannarexics" and believe me they ALWAYS fail at their extreme dieting.  So do yourself a favor and stop now before you screw up your metabolism so much that when you DO binge, you don't gain a million pounds and get even more obssessed with crash dieting more often.|`|wPLPMQEqaa	Some people are just immature.  Ignore them, I do.    but to answer your question...  Controlling your appetite takes practice.  You just have to start controlling you portions and stick to the same amount of portions.

kNLi16C6aa	I used to do a gym workout that focused on my abs...and one of the exercises was on a gym ball. nothing fancy, just one of those rubber balls that you sit on...and I used to do my sit ups on one of those. It worked really well, and helped my balance too. The instructer also said to get extra out of the exercise, to hold out a medicine ball (you know one of those really really heavy balls) or hold a weight between your arms, and as you hold it out, do your sit ups. You'll definitly feel it!    I did have good abs, but I've since stopped due to injury, and now I'm a blubbery mess.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	A lot of people like doing exercises with those balls, sure. It doesn't have to be any specific brand, you can probably find difference sizes and types.    I'm concerned about your weight though, I don't know how tall you are but 85 pounds sounds dangerously low for a 15 year old.
0HBXtFo7aa	Hmm from experience I have noticed that exercises such as a spin class or doing a lot of squats tend to build my legs more bulky than lean. I have Incorporated yoga and Pilate's into my fitness and it has certainly made a difference. Yoga and Pilate's makes you much leaner because you are using your own body weight as resistance, so the muscle build up is not as thick. Plus Pilate's targets the abdominal area which is important if you are looking for a flatter tummy. Ignoring ab work until you lose some belly fat may not be a good idea because doing proper ab work will help to tighten the muscles and make your tummy flatter. Keep up the cardio because that is important as well, but maybe try a different type of cardio such as jogging ( which is killer for your thighs and booty and calves) or using an elliptical. Keep at it and DO NOT  get discouraged from not seeing instant results.|`|Afmv2WYSaa	If you dont want to get bulky legs, maybe dont do spinning 7 days a week. Do it like 4 times a week and try another cardio activity the other three days. Like swimming, jogging, dancing, kickboxing, and im sure your gym has some classes you can try. But its really good that you have the modivation to work out 7 days a week! If you do that and eat well then i think you will see changes in two weeks or a month!!|`|n5ib2AC2aa	what is spinning ?  pleaasee let me know now im curious.  [;

Take two with a snack and full glass of water- BEFORE taking a percocet.|`|7p6vyx1Haa	I was prescribed the medication and it made me so ill with nausea, vomiting and dizziness. With side effects that extreme I could no longer stand to take it. However if she lies down immediately after taking it, with limited head movement, that may help. In addition, antihistamines help with the nausea even though they put you sleep for a long time. Hope this helps. If not, talk to your doctor immediately.|`|j8w0oCwZaa	Hi, I am on percocet to due to a broken kneecap lastnight. I am on and off of percocet like it's no ones business. Anyway, the key to not get nausea after you take it is take milk with it, or eat something that has peanut butter or eat something that has at least 6 grams of protein in it. Also, you can take tum, mylanta, Pepito or something like that before you take it and then take alittle more after you take it.

Jlg0ijQEaa	Hi there, as many as six per 1,000 children may be autistic. It's a good idea to keep a weather eye on your young child, because even very young children can be diagnosed. And research shows that the earlier the diagnosis and treatment, the better the prognosis for good outcomes.    So what should you be looking for? According to the National Institute of Mental Health, these are some of the red flags for autism:    Possible Indicators of Autism Spectrum Disorders        * Does not babble, point, or make meaningful gestures by 1 year of age      * Does not speak one word by 16 months      * Does not combine two words by 2 years      * Does not respond to name      * Loses language or social skills      * Poor eye contact      * Doesn't seem to know how to play with toys      * Excessively lines up toys or other objects      * Is attached to one particular toy or object      * Doesn't smile      * At times seems to be hearing impaired     It's important to remember that there are many possible explanations for most of the symptoms listed above. A child's attachment to a particular toy or difficulty with language skills is not, in itself, a sign of autism.    It's also important to remember that a child who does have excellent language skills may still be diagnosable on the autism spectrum. In fact, some children who are diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome have extraordinary language and reading skills.    What should you do if you are concerned that your child might be autistic? The first step is to consult your own pediatrician. It's also a good idea to take a look at How Is Autism Diagnosed -site which you can see in sources.|`|AEAxZEveaa	possibly, have you tried to find a reason for the screaming? Maybe he has food allergies. I think you should speak to a doctor about this.|`|V63jOkvsaa	Are your child's language skills developing well?  Does he have self injurious behaviour when he's acting like this?    That's really not enough information, but you should maybe see a doctor and if there is nothing medically wrong maybe see a child psychologist.

vVfH8yBYaa	There are definitely cancers that are genetic in nature. Translocations in the chromosomes have been proven to cause leukemias, lymphomas and sarcomas.

These markers do not guarantee that you will get cancer but you do have a much greater chance of developing cancer than those who don't.  With the knowledge of the these markers the person can have more pre-screening  to detect cancer at a much earlier time and treat it with a much better survival rate|`|oJ0p2Ietaa	some can be proven to be genetic|`|vXTlqHoKaa	Some cancers are hereditary.  Just because you have a family history of these cancers does not mean you WILL get them, it just means you are more likely to get the cancer than someone who does not have a family history of the cancer.

I know hes cold from the fever, but if he holds that heat in with a blanket, it will only get worse. Just a light sheet. Soaking in the bath is a good way to help the fever, as well as the cool rags.

HXnvvwL8aa	They are all pretty much the same.  They all do the same thing and that is vaporize a nicotine solution and mimic smoking.    The pricing is different because of several different reasons.      First, some companies offer them for dirt cheap, but once you get your unit, you are on your own.  There is no customer service whatsoever and they will not help you if something goes wrong.  There is also a flip side to this in that there are some bigger companies (one in particular - visit the forums below to find out who that is) who say that their expensive prices include warranties when they in fact, do not honor them.    Secondly, you can order direct from China but you will not be guaranteed delivery and your shipping costs will be between $39 and $100 so once you add that onto the price, you are up where the rest are.    Thirdly, some are a bit higher because they have been branded with custom packaging.  These might also have a higher overhead because they have kiosk rentals and so on.    Finally, some are a bit higher because keeping stock on the shelves is proving to be extremely difficult.    What is important is that you find someone you can trust.  Who will help you if your atomizer goes bad.  Who will pick up the phone or answer your emails in a timely fashion.  You will find some great suppliers who are very small in the business... that's where you should be shopping.  They WILL take care of you.

(so if I fell asleep in a class, I was pretty much screwed up).   I had to read 5-6 chapters everyday, 1-2 assignment/labs, going out for group meeting, working 18 hours a day.  IN the end, I couldn't stand it, I changed program.  Seriously, I didn't really learn anything in those 2 years.  sigh, failed education is failed.

Yes, you gain muscle by doing ab exercises and such, but if you have a layer of fat covering it, whos going to see it? If you want to flatten your stomach, you have to lower your Body Fat Percentage. The best exercise to do for reducing body fat percentage isn't sit ups, crunches or curls. The best exercise is something that will burn a lot of calories such as running, biking, swimming and most team sports.|`|cfn8mYF6aa	Build Muscle     Do Crunches. Lie on the floor (with or without a mat) and cross your arms in front of your chest. Bend your knees up as far as they go. (Do not place both hands behind your head. Placing both hands behind your head can cause lower back problems in the long run as it places unnecessary stress on that part of your body from pulling on your head and neck.) Another alternative is to cross your arms in front of your chest and lightly place your finger tips behind your ears, without pulling on your neck or ears to help raise you off the floor. Draw in your abdomen towards your spine while inhaling through your nose. Now raise your shoulders (upper torso) towards your knees, using strictly your abdominal muscles. It is very important not to lift your entire back off the floor, as this can cause back strain, and the extended movement does not help you develop six pack abs any faster. The most important part of the crunch is the initial flexing of your abs as you lift your shoulders off of the floor. As soon as you begin lifting off the floor exhale through your mouth, ending with a gasp once your shoulders are off the floor. Then pause for a second once you are at the top of the crunch and exhale the last bit of air from your diaphragm while flexing your abs. The proper breathing and flexing make all the difference. Now lower back down slowly and controlled while inhaling through your nose, just until your shoulder blades touch the ground. Do not let your head touch the ground and repeat.      Do Sit Ups. Lie on the floor, feet on the floor, knees up and fingers placed behind your ears or hands crossed on your chest. Sit all the way up, lifting your lower back off the floor along with your shoulder blades.Lower yourself down. Repeat. Once this becomes relatively easy for you (i.e. you can do a quite a bit with ease) start adding more challenges. Find an incline bench or do these on an exercise ball. Once you "graduate" from that, do weighted sit ups. Hold a weight on your chest while you do these. As these become easier, hold heavier and heavier weights. You might also try lifting your feet off the ground while doing the sit ups or alternating the leg in the air, like pretending to pedal while sitting up. If your hands are behind your head, bring your left knee up to touch your right elbow and then your right knee to the left elbow.      Do Leg Lifts. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands at your sides. Lift your legs straight up (not bending your knees at all) until they're at a 90 degree angle (or close). Lower your legs and repeat without letting your legs touch the floor. For more challenge there is equipment at most gyms that will allow you to raise yourself up using your arms as support and dangle your legs. You can perform leg lifts there too. If you're using this piece of equipment, you can make it easier by just raising your knees to your chest. It's more difficult to raise your legs to a horizontal position with your legs straight. This helps firm up the lower abdomen. If you're truly a monster, try doing leg lifts with a medicine ball hanging from your feet. Or hang from a pull up bar and raise your legs in front of you all the way up to the bar.      Do Jackknife Sit Ups. Lie down flat on the floor. Place your hands on the ground to your sides for balance; you can pick them up as you get used to the movement. Simultaneously raise your knees and torso so that your knees and face meet on an imaginary line extending from your pelvis to the ceiling. You should be able to kiss your knees at the top of the motion. Your legs will naturally fold bringing your feet towards your hips, much like a jackknife. Lie back down (i.e. "spread out") and repeat. Place a weight between your feet when you think you can handle it.   Do V-ups. Lie on the floor, legs straight out, hands on the floor but this time extended out over your head. Simultaneously raise legs and torso. Don't bend your knees! What kind of V would it be if you bend your knees? Reach with your hands toward the raised feet. Touch your feet if possible (will require some flexibility). Relax, return to starting position and repeat. Add weight between feet to match your taste.      Static Hold and Side Statics. Put your body into the push-up position but with your elbows on the floor, and your whole body flat. This position is known as the static hold position and it trains your core (including your abs) to hold the body in place which is the real purpose of your abs. Hold this position for as long as possible, but you should be aiming to start off with at least 45 seconds, while seasoned ab workers known to achieve over 20 minute static holds. To perform the side static hold roll onto one side of your body and lift into the same position as before, but this time only one arm will be on the ground with the other arm pointed straight up the air and your non weight bearing leg resting on your bottom leg. Once again, hold this for as long a|`|yQn34zO7aa	i want to no too|`|dpst3yD9aa	If you don't like crunches or sit ups then try the bicycle exercise!

eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	I hate to tell you, but all food is a collection of chemicals.  You just don't think of them that way.  But to a chemist, your table salt is still Sodium Chloride.  The vitamin A in your carrot is identical to the vitamin A in the vitamin tablet, except one was put there by nature, and the other was created in a laboratory- your body can't tell the difference.  Sugar is a natural product, derived from plants at least.  There are other sources of sweeteners as well.  One of the newest on the block is Stevia, another one to consider is Agave.  Both of those taste sweet, in some cases several times sweeter than the sugar you are accustomed to.   There is also fructose, which is fruit sugar.  Anything with a name that ends with -ose is a sugar of some sort, although not all of them are as "sweet" as you might think.  In the body, all of the -ose family are converted to glucose for use, no matter where they came from.   Your body was designed to use sugar, keep that in mind.  It wasn't designed to use the other types of sweeteners.  Sugar isn't a problem, it's too much of it that is.  So if you just want to avoid the artificial kinds, look for the stevia and the agave, or simply stick with regular old sugar and just watch the amounts.

5a2XVczMaa	Hey,  When your hart pounded faster were you extremely worried about anything (family or friends). Any sort of stress or even excitement or fear of being caught out by someone (for whatever reason) could cause this.  Do u have chest pains? If so I think you should see a doctor, but i wouldn't stress or panic about it. I had chest pains that started about 1 year ago. I was too busy to see a doctor, and it would only happen every now and then (but could last between 1 and 5 days at a time).    I seem to be okay now and haven't felt any chest pains for about 2 months now. But only noticed that after i started to eat healthier so i'm thinking that that may have been the problem (fatty foods like McDonald's that is). I've never been an overweight person, in fact most people would call me under weight...lol    I'm also a gymnast, which is a very hard on the body so that could play a role.    Do u do any sports like gymnastics or dance?    I found this article about chest pain. Here's the site http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...    Hope this helps.

For positioning, try standing with one foot on the toilet seat, or sit on the toilet with your legs wide open. In either position, make sure to take a deep breath to relax your muscles.

Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice.     If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it, as with the B vitamins, should you decide to take them. Vitamin and health food stores are good sources, because they specialise in this area, and have a high turnover, so their products are less likely to be old.

FvmLoso6aa	It's very easy to be negative towards yourself.  An exercise that I learned in my studies is that every night, before you go to bed, come up with 5 reasons you like yourself and NO negative things.  Ignore the negatives.  If you do this every night, and honestly try to come up with new things, not just reuse things out of ease, you can improve your self esteem.      People will always find reasons to judge other people.  You can't control what people think or say about you, but you can learn to not let it bother you.  As a general rule, people can't stand to see other people doing well in one way or another.  So if you stand out in any way they'll judge you, and if you try not to stand out, they still will.  Just learn to accept that.  Just because people judge you doesn't mean that anything is wrong with you, just society as a whole.|`|2fc1TfiCaa	Since you are twelve, you will probably:    -grow up to be a pretty girl.  -have a lot of friends  -be very talented    the fact is, you will never know what happen tomorrow, cheer up, there are always some surprises waiting for you.|`|A2JbYCWFaa	Well, you knaw what the Truth is, Jesus is your friend, and Jesus Loves you, so you shpuld never feel unloved or friendless, I'll keep you in my prayers and God Bless you and may you find His light at the end of the dark tunnel!|`|6NZeItMAaa	Believe in you and go for what you want.

Focus on your studies and relationships with your family members. If that doesn't work then set out to change yourself. Get a new (perhaps drastic) haircut, try a new style in clothes, if you're not happy with who you are then do something about it. We can not change the ways that others view us, but we can change the way we view ourselves.

There's a lot of criticism and arguments about whether a food can even be considered "negative" in calories. Definitely these foods are great and healthy for you, but I think it's better to east them as part of a balanced diet so you get all the nutrients your body needs to stay healthy. Plus, if you don't change your eating habits permanently you'll just gain the weight back when you quit the diet anyway.

37gKN2z1aa	Acid not as bad as cocaine or heroine?  That's a joke!    It's bad, don't do it.  Drugs are bad.|`|0093869f07845dd527b36638eab7a303aa	It can be a very frightening experience if you find that you are not enjoying it. Impossible to describe the experience, really.    The worst of it is, it can last for a couple of days, and there is no way to make it stop. Nobody ever tells you that. Trying to carry on doing your normal stuff in front of people when in that condition can be very difficult and upsetting (or funny). Make sure you haven't got school in the morning!     It can also mess with your head and leave you with lasting psychological problems, especially if you take it regularly. I had a mate who ended up in the loony bin because of it.    I feel obligated to point out it can also be a blast. People wouldn't take it if it wasn't fun. But it's not for everyone. Personally I always found mushrooms a much more fun night out. Similar kind of deal, but  just something about them agreed with me more.|`|sI5jTpoRaa	it depends on what you want to do later in life honestly.. if you only do it one time it most likely wont be that bad. if you can keep it to one time.. because if you do acid 3 or more times you are legally insane. i consider it as bad as cocaine. but not heroine. Try something else hallucinagenic first and see if you like that feeling. like try salvia or somthing else first because an acid trip can be very very long and if you end up not liking hallucinations well.. that would just suck.|`|jv0BDTNMaa	Acid will trip your balls dude.  Don't do it.  If you do do it, stay in a room where you can't stab yourself with anything.|`|H7kmp0qdaa	Acid is a chemical and therefore is bad for you.    However, that being said so is alcohol, cigarettes, and things we come in contact with every day of our lives. Acid is a very powerful drug that not only makes you see visuals, but makes you look at your life as you know it in a whole different light. It can be very beautiful and cause you to have wonderful thoughts much deeper than you normally look into things. But if you aren't emotionally stable, i wouldn't recommend it because it can cause a bad trip where you think terrible thoughts and see very bad things. Just respect the drug and it will respect and teach you a lot. I am a junior in college and have a 3.5 gpa and no psychological issues and have never had any long term negative effects and I have done acid more than 10 times along with mushrooms and extacy. Don't let these prudes tell you how to live your life. If you want to do it, go for it and you will not regret it!     Peace and love     Edit: I'd also like to add that you should only take one hit. It should cost around 6-7 dollars but can cost up to 12. It will last around 8 hours if it's weak acid and 10-12 hours if it's strong. Just depends. After you take it, it takes around 45 minutes to kick in.    If you have any other questions or would like to discuss it more you can email me :)

Doctors used to think that HSV-1 caused only cold sores (oral herpes) and HSV-2 genital herpes, but they now know that both virus types can cause both types of herpes. Between 50 and 80% of all adults carry oral HSV and about 1 in 4 have a genital HSV infection, although it may be inactive. Most people who are infected are not aware of it, since many people rarely or never develop the characteristic blisters. HSV cannot be cured, although it can be controlled and may become dormant.     Despite HSV being a very common infection, doctors don't believe that the virus causes miscarriages in most cases. Some research shows that women with unexplained recurrent miscarriages seem to be statistically more likely to have an undetected HSV infection than are women with no history of miscarriage, but there aren't any explanations for what that means and whether the virus actually plays a role in causing miscarriages for those women. Most women who are infected with HSV do not have recurrent miscarriages, so doctors need to conduct more research on the matter.     Similarly, a few researchers have found evidence that the virus could cross the placenta and lead to damage of the placenta (potentially increasing the risk of late pregnancy loss), but doctors don't understand what factors cause this to happen, given that the majority of infected women do not have this problem.     Thus, the biggest risk of having an active genital herpes infection during pregnancy is that the baby could acquire the infection during delivery, which could lead to serious health complications or death. Doctors may suggest a Caesarian section for women with active herpes who are about to give birth, and they may prescribe antiviral medications to women with a history of genital herpes infection in order to prevent an outbreak.     The risk of the baby being infected at birth is much higher for pregnant women who acquire genital herpes for the first time in their third trimester of pregnancy than for women who have been previously infected, so it is very wise to take continue to practice safe sex during pregnancy. If you suspect that you have herpes symptoms and you are concerned, the best thing to do is to talk to your OB/GYN or midwife about your concerns. But merely having a history of herpes shouldn't be any reason why you can't have a healthy pregnancy if you follow your doctor's advice|`|LsE1RS0vaa	Some research has tied herpes to miscarriage, but the biggest risk of active herpes during pregnancy is that the baby could become infected during birth. if treated a baby can be healthy even if the mother has herpes. the biggest risk is usually during birth because it could cause the baby to go blind as they are passing through the birth canal. which is why the ob-gyn covers the babies eyes to prevent this.|`|wQJtKx6zaa	No. The risks to the baby only occur during delivery that can lead to blindness, and other medical challenges, but it does not cause miscarriage. I have a girlfriend that I knew contracted herpes in college, and she delivered two babies vaginally with no complications.|`|fk9AvB25aa	Some medicines for herpes are safe to take during pregnancy. I asked the same question at check out babycenter.com and people there say that Valtrex is safe to take during pregnancy. But the only real risk of passing herpes onto a baby is when it comes through the birth canal and there is an out break at the time. There is also a risk of having a chemical pregnancy during the first weeks of pregnancy.  You should talk to your doctor about all of your health concerns. It's better to have an open policy with them then to keep them guessing or not have them help you at all. You should also have regular check ups and if you have an out break in between check ups you may want to mention that to your doctor.
D1jHDQgVaa	Develop a diet and an exercise plan that works for you. Try to cut foods high in trans and saturated fats, as well as sugar. Get more fiber in your diet, which can help you feel fuller longer. Fruits and vegetables are a good source of fiber, and fruits are naturally sweet to curve your sweet tooth. Monitor your calorie intake, and try to take in only the energy you need in relation to your activity level. You eat to live, not live to eat.     Some good snack foods that I would recommend are low-fat yogurt, fiber bars, and 100 Calorie packs. Another thing you might check is your milk. Are you drinking whole milk? You might try 1% or maybe even skim. There are tons of reduced fat and low calorie products out there that taste great.    For exercise, play a sport you love, ride your bike, dance to some crazy techno music, anything! Don't think you have to force yourself to run, join a gym, or do a bunch of boring sit ups. Walking is an easy way to get some exercise. Take your dog for a walk, or plug in your mp3 player and go for it. The best pace to go at is one that gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat lightly. Walk as far as you can, and try to increase how far you go each time.    Some other tips:  - Don't skip breakfast! Chances are you'll feel hungrier later on in the day, and your chances of overeating increase. If you're not used to eating breakfast, or you don't have enough time, try something as simple as a granola bar and a glass of milk or orange juice. Anything to give you that important boost of energy to keep you going through the day.    - Avoid eating 2-3 hours before you go to bed. If you're absolutely starving, have a small snack like an apple or yogurt.    - I've found that chewing minty gum makes me feel less hungry. Mint is a natural appetite suppressant, plus if you're chewing gum, you're less likely to eat something. And your breath will smell nice!    : )     Hope that helps!|`|I54KyS8Laa	Did you think this thing through? If your church is having a "Big Loser" contest, there must be some big needy folk in your congregation who may or may not be motivated to join.

And if any of them aren't motivated to join in the frey, have you considered how silly you will look as the "big loser"? A competition that wasn't even intended for you!    Unless they are offering $500 bucks to the winner and your really need the money to pay for groceries, the game isn't worth it, just sit back and help the real people who need to be the big loser get motivated.

I HATE THEM!    First, switch these things:    White Bread for Wholgrain/Wholemeal.  White Pasta for Brown pasta.  Full-Fat Milk for Low-Fat.  Soda for Diet Soda [Or preferably, no Soda at all].    Get rid of Chips and Lolllies in your house.  [Not in the trash - maybe you'd like to organise a big Hamper at your Church where people that are joining the Competition can put the foods they're trying to cut out of their diet, so people that are less fortunate can enjoy them].    Print out some charts like this:    ______________________________________    Fruit:               1    2    3      Vegetables:     1    2    3    4    Water[glass]    1    2   3    4    5    6    7    8  ______________________________________...    Then stick it up on your fridge, and every time you have a piece of fruit that day, you circle ' 1' on your chart. When you have a second piece, you circle  2 [second piece of fruit], and so on.  The same goes for Vegetable servings, and glasses of water.  This will make it easier for you to understand how much of the good stuff you're having. try to circle everything on that list by 8pm everyday!  [Replace the list everyday].    Corn and Peas are high in Stach [as are Potatoes], so don't eat too much of them.    Go for walks everyday, or if its too cold, run up and down your stairs if you have them [be careful though!].  if it's too hot, swim!    I have been walking everyday for an hour [seems like a lot, but it's actually quite fun] and have been eating healthy, and I can already notice a difference in a week!

If you are going to cut down on weight the you should reduce 500 calories from your normal intake, but do not go under 1,200 calories a day.

The best diet (and I mean diet as in healthy eating not fad diet) is to eat fresh foods. Fresh veggies, fresh fruit, yogurt, whole grains ect.... Try to avoid fatty meats, pastries, ect.... If its mostly sugar or fat then stay away from it! Drink plenty of water and pure fruit juice ( I like the new V8 fusion fruit juice) Don't snack between meals, if thats hard for you then choose healthy snacks like veggies, fruit, rice cakes. Rice cakes are not that bad if you get the flavored ones, I like the low fat caramel ones. Much better for you then cookies or chips. As for exercise cardio is best which means lots of running, skipping rope, and biking. If you eat right, run everyday, and drink lots of water you will lose weight in no time at all! If you want to tone your stomach as well you can throw in an ab workout (crunches, yoga, pillates) maybe 3 times a week. Running is the best way to lose just pounds though. Don't push yourself too hard, indulge occasionally if you want to- one piece of cake at a party never made anyone obese!

With variety you wont get tired of working out, so youll keep at it, not give up in a few weeks, For a good cardio excersize, try soccer, baskeyball, running, or other sports which involve alot of running.

I hope you succeed.|`|qIyTZRWVaa	Drink a glass of bacon grease|`|Ej5ykFwYaa	pilaties tommorow|`|zSOP5hcOaa	try the zumba workouts|`|T5FDeDYDaa	since your a guy  just do squats   those work the best|`|FwZyFTA0aa	Crunches. They hurt after 20 but they give faster results than sit-ups depends how much results you wanna see. :)|`|Inw5heh8aa	lie on your back and try to lift your legs a couple inches off the ground for as long as you can. You'll feel it work. ^_^|`|Lf03hCx4aa	the bicycle crunch is the most recomended.|`|Vpa3cmVyaa	Supine Bicycles, Situps, Crunches, Body Twists, Medicine Ball throw, body twist with a stick, decline sit ups, weighted incline sit ups, weighted oblique bend overs.    See results in a few weeks. Do it till you get muscle failure every two days AT LEAST|`|euAN1gewaa	Depends on how advanced you are.  The best one you can do is the hanging leg raise.  It's where you have elbow straps you can hang from, and you bend your knees up toward your chest.  Youtube it and you can find demos.    The other one is to lay on your back and called the bicycle kick.|`|vqbApPQxaa	you also need to incorporate aerobic exercise in order to lose weight. Ab exercises only build muscle.|`|RdvL6CGmaa	YEAH SKATEBOARDING!!!!  Get a gym membership, run around the block. Healthy diet... A month or two    Please answer my question!!!|`|z88NWKoQaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOri5Tlm2...|`|Jxq4TIavaa	Best way in a opinion is never do regular crunches as most people would start off the ground and land back down. Basically, you don't lose much weight from that. But, have a thick sweater or anything that you would lay on, roll it up into like a pillow or ball, and sit on the ground putting the object behind your lower back near your butt. In that way you dont ever touch the ground and it'll keep tension in your abs making it a 3 week normal ab process but just 5-10 mins a day. Plus, you might wanna do side crunches to get a good rounded shape of abs.|`|El2Hw6fRaa	do 200 scrunches a day . 100 in the morning and 100 before bed. also replace the potato chips with tortilla chips.no actually corn chips, with low salt..|`|iBkSJPmxaa	Yoga, stretching. But the more important is to have a great diet. Nothing to do with low Carole's and low carbs, or starving. What you have to do add good quality food.   1.- Avoid chemicals or diet things  2.- Add good fats to your diet  3.- Avoid stress or foods that can cause stress like simple carbs (cookies, white bread, sugar, cakes, and more)  4.-Add organic foods  5.- Eat organic yogurt  6.-Drink alot of water  well this is some good tips good luck|`|S5caRmvAaa	"lie on your back and try to lift your legs a couple inches off the ground for as long as you can. You'll feel it work. ^_^"    ^That's a good one. It really works if you can make yourself do it for a minute.     Then do bicycles, which is like...in a crunch position reach your right elbow to your left knee, and then switch. Do 15 reps of those, so 30 all together if that's how you want to count them.     Then, lay on your back and put your hands, palms down, at your sides. Pick your feet up a couple inches off the ground and then bend your knees and then stretch your legs out to one side, keeping your shoulders as close to the ground as you can. Then go back to the middle, then the other side..all without touching the floor. 5 sets of those.     The minute drill is really hard at first, but stay with it...Do all three of those 3 times a day. Definite results right there.|`|77b1b9a7c4b01b836dc3452fd6dbdce0aa	try crunches for about a month and you should see amazing results!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	you wont loose any fat doing just ab exercises, you need to do cardio as well.

vkrQ29lOaa	Everyone is different when it comes to this. Some guys are "grow"-ers and some guys are "show"-ers. A "grow"-er is someone whose size increases incredibly when he's erect, while a "show"-er is a guy who has a lot to show when he is not erect and whose size does not increase much when he becomes erect. Sorry if this is not the precise answer you were looking for.|`|0JERmAslaa	some people r growers and some r showers|`|48Yf8tpsaa	These things vary from man to man. Our bodies move blood away from our penis when it is needed to perform other tasks... you know for muscles and stuff.... and blood is redirected to the penis when a sexual stimulus is percieved.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	It depends - a penis which is large when flaccid will usually not grow much when erect. A penis which is small when flaccid usually grows a great deal more.|`|yXDtGo8taa	An average male has an erection of 6" and when a penis is not erected the average size is 2.5 - 3 inches|`|2gdWeMRfaa	i would say anywhere in between 1-4in bigger would be normal, it depends and varies though, there is no definite number

1aJjFrUCaa	don't be so paranoid about it. nothing gets ripped, yeah it stretches bc of his thing going inside of you. but don't be paranoid about it. and it's just discharge. you may have a yeast infection also if it burns when you pee. but usually right after you have sex and go pee it will burn. there's nothing wrong. if your vagina keeps hurting contact your doctor. you have a yeast infection. nothing to worry about.
ZDdUSL2Naa	Breast pain is usually due to hormonal changes in the body, puberty is one big hormonal journey so it is more than likely to do with that. :)|`|goe3y4FPaa	UR A GUY..

7623Hd7naa	Sounds like you are not eating enough calories (probably on the days you do 90 minutes of cardio plus weights). Your body might be in starvation mode, in which case it will hold on to the fat because it thinks it's starving! <br>  <br>  This is not for sure, this is my opinion. You can google it for more information.|`|Fulmgnmsaa	Why don't you start running. It helps. And the weights aren't gona help because It puts muscle on you and you just gain weight.|`|9f3e662ced5c3455403ad740118b4e2baa	The belly was not built in a day or a week or even months. Years of bad habits will not disappear in months. Be patient and keep working the plan. Perhaps you might Google some exercises targeting the Abs.<br>  Perhaps back off on the water a bit as much of that is stored in the abs. The only thing I see wrong here is your wish for instant gratification. Quiting will not make it better. You are on the right path but it is not a short trip. Keep up the good work!

flKkoiwbaa	Ouch!    Traumatic nail avulsions are painful but seldom serious.  If the toenail appears to still be partially attached, then leave it be - it will protect the delicate nail bed underneath.  You may need to carefully clip away small bits of the toenail if it seems they may be just hanging out, waiting to get caught on something else!      Wash the area carefully with soap and water, then apply some gauze or a bandage.  Your goal is to keep the area clean, dry and protected, which can be difficult with your feet!  The toenail will probably fall off and a new one will grow in (eventually)    Watch carefully for signs of infection, which can occur when the nailbed is exposed.  Increasing redness, pain, fever, swelling, nasty looking drainage, and red streaks from the area mean you need to see your doctor.    Good luck :-)|`|L1z5qydSaa	Wait until it heals a bit then use a nail clipper to get rid of it, or wait for your toenail to go, the bit may fol off on its own. In the meantime try not to bump it into anything.|`|8tYTSN3Kaa	wait till the part thats hurting heals till you rip it off... wrap it until then|`|WmzvMgkmaa	I don't know if it'll fall off but, just leave it alone it'll grow back eventually.|`|OYWKu6ouaa	I would cut it down as far as you can and then put a Band-Aid on it.  Just be careful not to hit it.  I know it hurts.  Good luck!|`|6cmQIMnAaa	LMAO. xD You made my day! LOL. Grab a nail clipper and clip it off? LOL. AHAHAHA xDDD LOL. Thanks man! xD|`|o0VyLaPiaa	You should use medical scissors or your nail clippers and trim the jagged edge, so that it doesn't get caught again.  Then, soak your foot in some epsom salts and warm water.  Leave the toe undressed during the day, but put some neosporin or other anti-bacterial on it and a bandaid at night.|`|MSb3gi3Caa	the best thing to do is to cut it and be careful with it, i hate it when that happens, but it happens... good luck|`|XZk6PoD2aa	probably best to tape or band aide the nail to your toe for at least a few days to let it heal a bit and also to let it grow out some. It will eventually grow all the way out, but once its a few days healed it may be less sensitive.

FTRs5w3eaa	It should be completely gone within a week. You dont always need a prescription either. The Vagisil that you buy at any drug store or supermarket/ grocery store will clear up a yeast infection just as fast, if not faster. And its cheaper than going to your doctor and getting a prescription. Vagisil also has the added benefit of the fact that you can pick what dosage and strength you want. (ex: 7 day kit, 5 day, 2 day ovule and even a one day dose)    If you are still experiencing some discharge by the end of the week you started taking it, I would call your doctor and explain that it hasnt gone away yet.|`|aDGOfFfEaa	Normally it takes the first two days for it to go away but normally u get a perscription for at least a week i don't know why you only got 2 days worth

Possible if it's in excess of six months.    Your basically putting yourself on a concentration camp diet.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	yes you will.   ugh, but that will get so gross so fast.   Just exercise and eat what you want.|`|zdIQTA9Yaa	you'll actually lose muscle and because celery actually gets rid of calories and since that's all you eat you wont lose any so it will eat at your protein iron and muscle|`|o43uZSDJaa	You will kill your body, and crap a lot, celery is basically, fiber. You can eat smaller, healthier meals more frequently. It gets your thyroid gland moving faster to burn fat. whatever you do, don't not eat, you will actually gain weight, you will become bloated, and if you eat one meal, your thyroid will not "work" as well, and it will make you gain weight. Also, stay away from energy drinks, they make you fat. Trust me, I'm a wrestler, loosing weight is what we are good at. =D|`|oUxEhbkkaa	It will help you to lose weight but it will also make you sick because you need to have different food groups.

But if you want to reduce way, you better drink juice celery before each meal.

nksewi03aa	There are actually various ways that "crossed eyed" people can see:<br>  <br>  1) Their brain picks one eye, usually the dominant one, and uses just that one.  The other eye is allowed to atrophy and the vision out of it becomes minimal or non-existent.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  2) Their brain "merges" information from both eyes by ignoring the parts of the vision that over-lap.  It can do this because the brain is amazing at adapting to strange visual situations.  A famous experiment in the 1970's had people wear glasses that either showed the world upside-down, or showed them two overlapping images.  In both cases, people gradually adjusted to this type of vision and were able to walk, drive, run as they did before.  Once the glasses were removed, they could not function until their brain re-adapted.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  3) The brain causes both eyes to atrophy and instead chooses to see only the absence or presence of light (and sometime colors).  Basically its like putting your head in a white plastic bag.  You can't see distinct shapes, but you can tell if the lights are on or off.   This is the type of vision that children with congenital Nystagmus, crossed yes, and certain developmental disorders often end up with.<br>  <br>  Having both eyes crossed is usually only seen in children with severe developmental brain disorders these days because crossed eyes is often a muscle imbalance that can be corrected surgically in otherwise physically and developmentally normal children.|`|xvey8ixPaa	Most people with crossed eyes only have one that does that, and usually that eye has shut down early in life and had no vision. So, for the better part they see fine out of the eye that is normal. I have been an optician for over 28 years and have never seen someone with both eyes like this.
01Mu3wUeaa	If your brother had the flu, he wouldn't be vomiting.He would have respiratory symptoms.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he has Noro virus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lysol WON'T work.Only bleach will.<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell him to stay in his room and get him a trash can to vomit in so he doesn't have to contaminate the bathroom.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prevention:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.|`|q0vKbocHaa	wash your hands, and bascially lock yourself in your room, only go out when you need to go to the bathroom and get something to eat. and wash your hands every time you go upstairs.|`|ArKT9O7Maa	LOCK HIM IN HIS ROOM YOU IDIOT.

UZJ7wVc8aa	It will weigh the same when you freeze it. If it's heavy enough then yes you can use them as weights. Just make sure that they're comfortable to hold. You can also try other heavy household objects.    http://straighthealth.com|`|84fm2GXOaa	yes you can use water bottles or buckets of water instead of weights.|`|vLVbVtDSaa	Yes.  I also used to use soup cans before I bought weights.  They are nice too because you can get them in a bunch of different sizes so you have you a little variety from day to day.  And it is much cheaper than buying bottles of water!
xXTUWwzFaa	workout every part of your body..  run for 20-25 mins on the treadmille  20 jumping jacks while holding 2-5 lb weights (will work your arms and legs!)  then, do 3 sets of 100 cruches    try to switch it up while still working the same muscles, try the stair climber machine for 10-15 mins instead of the treadmille for 20-25 mins, find a new type of crunch to do.Try not to get bored with your routinne.  i know this is hard, but it well help you reach your goal faster, dont think you cant do it because you can. just keep thinking of how great you are going to feel when you are done.   For a good workout reward yourself.. a shopping spree! or a smoothie.. just not too many fatty foods!!|`|Q2rJixP8aa	Well, you have to rembmer you can't work  more then 2 muscle groups a day .. so i would plan to do arms on mondays abs on tuesdays and legs on wendsedays and make a patteren. But for abs you can't just do crunches and sit ups that only works one part of the core! I would buy p90x or search differnt ab work outs to help you. Eating right makes you lose weight and only eat when your hungry to you are full!     I hope this helped! Have fun on your cruise|`|43A0U8l2aa	i would recommend 30 minutes of cardio everyday. you can mix it up by one day using the elliptical and the next day using the treadmill. However try to jog on the treadmill because you will get more out of your workout. and put it on a 1.0 incline    As for weight lighting i would do lots of ab exercises  and work upper body and lower body everyday but alternate the exercises/different muscles so you are not doing the same thing everyday. try squats, bench press, etc    hope this helps|`|NyTkZJQ0aa	Well first of all I have to say that exercise alone can be ineffective if your diet is bad, so first make sure that you're eating right.    Secondly, exercise plans are different for everyone.  Try doing things that you're comfortable with, but make sure to fit both cardio and strength training in there.  Next, only work one muscle group daily, or make sure that your muscles in each group get to rest 1-3 days before you work them out again.    Otherwise, I don't know what machines your particular gym has, so just go in, try out each machine, and do what feels right and what works for you.
gERaZGZeaa	To bulk up, you just need to eat lots and lots (and lots) of oatmeal, chicken, lean beef, nuts, eggs, whole grains, potatoes, protein shakes, etc.  Lift heavy weights.    To give you instant weight for a weigh in... there's not much you can do.  There's only so much food your stomach can hold.  A variation of a couple pounds isn't going to keep you away from the coxswain position.

iZEAJGK3aa	you have slowed your metabolism. the only ways to speed up your metabolism are with supplements (like diet pills) or obtaining muscle mass.  do not try taking the supplements. you will screw up everything. you should have a metabolic rate check. you breath into a machine for 10 minutes and it reads how many calories you burn at a resting rate. you will have to eat as many calories above that calculation that you are willing to exercise off. you need to build muscle while exercising, and your new muscles will burn more calories so you can eat normally agian. without having a metabolic check, you will basically have to increase your calorie intake little by little until you see that you have gained a small amount of weight, then you need to see how much exercising you need to do while eating that new amount to stay at that new weight. this will slowly build muscle, and you will be able to even out your metabolism. it wont happen overnight. anorexia is hard to get over, and its very improductive, all the exercise you avoided while in starvation mode, you will need to do now just to make sure you are going to stay at your desired weight.|`|nbNhvJZjaa	Well natalie,just a couple of warnings.

1XFpomQYaa	Drink lots of clear fluid -- no alcohol or caffeine. Milk will usually prolong diarrhea, but it might help provide nutrients for folks with very mild cases. For moderate to severe cases, use an electrolyte solution like Gatorade or Pedialyte.    Eat probiotic yogurt. These active cultures can ease the symptoms of some types of diarrhea and shorten their duration.    Try the BRAT diet: bananas, rice, apples or applesauce, and dry toast. This diet is often suggested for kids, but adults can eat it as well. It's not necessary to restrict kids or adults to this diet, but adding these foods may help shorten episodes of diarrhea.you should eat foods high in complex carbohydrates, such as crackers, noodles, oatmeal, potatoes toast, and soups and noodles. They should avoid dairy products and foods high in sugar or fat.     Avoid diarrhea medications, unless the doctor tells you to take them. The function of diarrhea is to rid the body of bad bugs. Often the only way to get better is to suffer through the loose stools.    If it prolongs, go to the doctor. If it lasts a few more days, go to the doc just incase :)    Diarrhea can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites (tiny organisms that live inside a larger organism)medicines such as antibiotics and  foods such as milk. Usually it is cause something has not agreed with you.  diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease and irritable bowel syndrome can also cause it.  Sometimes no cause for diarrhea can be found.    I wouldnt worry, it will usualyl just go away on its own :)|`|f1174a6f1a9f4cbfe1a8285c6b72ef70aa	OH GEE, THATS THE SH-TS|`|6ch5VRzTaa	GO SEE A DOCTOR AND HE WILL SHOW YOU WHATS WRONG OR TAKE SOME MEDICINE|`|PyeyaDScaa	There is nothing worng with you.Something you have eaten obviously hasnt agreed with you, so the best thing to do is to go to the pharmacist and buy some Dioralyte sachets, these contain rehydration salts consisting of sugars and salts (glucose, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and disodium hydrogen citrate). They are used to replace body fluids lost as a result of acute diarrhoea.    Diarrhoea makes you lose more fluids and electrolytes (salts such as sodium and potassium) than you usually would and can make you dehydrated. Sachets of rehydration salts are used to replace body fluids lost as a result of diarrhoea.    If the diarrhoea doesnt stop then i suggest you buy some tablets called immodium, and this will stop you from doing any diarrhoea. Try that for a few days and if it still hasnt stopped then you best go see a doctor.     Also please make sure that you constantly keep hydrated during the day, as you will be losing alot of water throughout the day. So you should always try to be sipping on water. The last thing you want is to have more problems from being dehydrated.     good luck poo bum
bT0bMxmfaa	Well, I've had braces now since early September, but I started to prepare for them as early as June (I'm 13).<br>  <br>  If you first get braces, the days will be a little tough, but you'll get over the pain within a few days.  Everytime you tighten it, it will hurt for several days.  I reccomend cutting up your food into little bite-sized pieces or possibly eatting soft foods.  Seriously try your hardest to avoid hard foods like pretzels.  If you bite into them, your bracket (the metal sqaure thing glued to your teeth) might fall off and it will take a while to glue back and dry (I'm pretty sure you're familiar with the whole process).<br>  <br>  For me, it only takes me about several days for the pain to stop, usually less than a week.  I think by tomorrow or before the weekend comes, your pain will stop.  However, it's different for every person, but try taking a painkiller like Tyneol.  <br>  <br>  And yes, I did lose weight while I was preparing my braces and when I had them.  I lost several pounds by preparation and several more when I first got them.  Usually, you're not allowed to eat alot of foods when you first get your braces.  But now, my weight is consistent, but its different for everyone.  I wouldn't exactly expect a dramatic drop in weight.  <br>  <br>  You'll be able to eat more foods as you move on, but just remember to brush and floss no matter how bad it hurts.  If your teeth aren't clean, the outcomes won't be pretty.  Especially when you get them taken off.  If something gets stuck in your teeth, gently use a toothpick to remove it.  Chances are, your fingers won't be able to reach it and your fingers are likely dirty.<br>  <br>  If you know you can't eat something, don't eat it.  You'll know that you probably won't ever be able to while your braces are still attached to your teeth.  Don't try either, because something might end up broken or derranged and if that happens, the results could be costly.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your braces!<br>  I hoped I helped (sorry for writing such a long answer, but here's my personal advice and experience).|`|OleVPkJgaa	applesauce<br>  pudding<br>  no bread! it gets waayy stuck|`|m8wMKhOoaa	yougurt, soup, drinks, ice cream, popsicles, hot chocolate, coffee, tea, anything thats smooth|`|TCYrvsaZaa	Eat soup or pudding...and try not to eat anything whole for at least 3 to4 days
AGcwdZGmaa	believe it or not it could be a cyst in your ovaries you need to see the dr either way|`|LMRaSXFeaa	that sounds terrible. :/  i would see a doctor if i were you.|`|zx8cVDqIaa	It might be a temporary thing, I guess it proceeds you may need to see a doctor.|`|s1yXI0MAaa	If it's pain across your abdomen, it could be a lot of different things.    It's obviously not going away, so it sounds like something you need to see your doctor about. It could be serious or nothing at all, but either way, you are unnecessarily putting yourself at risk if you don't get medical attention soon.    Ignore whatever answers you get from Yahoo Answers, and see a real doctor! :) Good luck.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Not always.|`|LMRaSXFeaa	when you break you hymen you bleed. you can break it with fingering and with tampons and things so it just depends.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Not necessarily.  I bled, though.|`|st2zmU88aa	No not always..  Some girls don't bleed at all. Every girl is different, It all depends on ur hymen .|`|Qr7EiDo8aa	nope, if your hymen was broken from riding a bike or a horse ( no not that way sick people) then you will not bleed. or also if you used tampons. but if that layer of skin is still there you will bleed because you have a bigger object forcing its way into a smaller one so it has to tear something to fit.|`|N8AJnAbuaa	thats a terrible disease u MUST see the doctor and MUST tell ur parents there is a rik of gettin AIDs|`|etLfz702aa	yes, most girls do. It's a tiny amount, like half a teaspoon.|`|6YL7yWfxaa	This is from you breaking your hymen. When your hymen breaks, in some cases it bleeds.     Hope I helped,  ?Meg|`|NPy69FENaa	nope.  i didn't :]]|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I didnt bleed. I also know 2 of my friends didnt either. But I also know some that did. So not all women bleed on their first time.|`|2WRrEVYjaa	my personal experience i bleed to much in first time|`|GuOJIftAaa	I didn't and it didnt hurt for me either.|`|VX16L24Taa	You should have done a looot more reading online before your first sex encounter.. i would have informed you better, and you wouldnt be worried.. or asking this question.     But dont WORRY! That just means your hymen was intact, and during the intercourse it was broken causing it to bleed.     People who dont bleed their first time, just means that their hymen wasnt intact from tampons, sports, horse back ridding, or they werent born with one,  or sadly the intercourse couldnt 'even' break it :P    Anywhoo you'll be sore a bit, but fine... just wear a liner for a bit. Hope it was something worth remembering.|`|brSfRLspaa	no, I think less than half of girls bleed, like maybe 40%|`|uWjkYMQpaa	No. I didn't the first time, but i did the third time.  I didn't the frist time i got fingered but i did the second time.
ecOfV8Blaa	Look up on google or youtube fit ladies and the trouble they went through.
PvIFahGjaa	Yeah you should. Take them before or after lifting weights. Or both. I take protein shakes before and after working out. They have alot of protein so it will help build muscle.
nksewi03aa	Soft contacts:  No, at least not on a long term basis.  Sometimes your eyes shapes itself slightly to the curve of the contact, but this effect seldom lasts more than 15-30 minutes after you have removed them.<br>  <br>  Rigid contact lenses: Yes, a special type of hard lens actually "shapes" your eye the same curve it has.  Think "invisalign",  but for eyes instead of teeth.  A doctor uses a series of contacts to remold the front of your eye over time.  This is not permanent though and you have to wear a "retainer" contact at least once a week for the effect to stay.<br>  <br>  Are you actually "improving" your vision though? Not really, what you are doing is reshaping a part of your eye (the cornea) to compensate for the part that is causing the vision problem itself, which is 90% of the time an elongated or foreshortened eyeball (8% of the time the refractive error is in the cornea).|`|xvey8ixPaa	Well, there are ortho K rigid contacts that one would wear at night that change the shape of the cornea so that during the day you have better vision. Yes, it can be done. It is like having braces and then a retainer if you have your teeth worked on. Look up Orthokeratology online and see what you find out!|`|rGci1ehoaa	if you have astigmatism it can improve with the use of contacts... i wore contacts for 9 years and it never improved.. but i got lasik a year ago and now have 20/20 vision so i dont have that problem.. Get lasik its the best thing i have ever done
517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	No, they won't stunt her growth, but it won't help her lose belly fat either. If she wants to fit into her clothes, she'd be better off cutting out junk food, eating several snack size meals through the day of HEALTHY food, and getting regular aerobic exercise (walking, bicycling, swimming, jogging, etc.) She should go at a pace that makes her breathe harder, but not so hard that she can't carry on a conversation.
Vk7kkrcLaa	It could be a brain tumor. this causes the symptoms that you describes plus severe headaches that get a lot worse when the patient lays down. it can also cause changes in personality and behavior of the patient. tumors in certain locations in the brain cannot be operated on as it is too risky, therefore it can be classed as being incurable in that manner.<br>  <br>  All the best with your story|`|yjDAg8v7aa	Brain cancer? Evidently my brain tumor had been there for years but wasn't discovered until I had an mri and mra due to a freak grand mal seizure. I'd had migraines and starry vision on and off for a year before the seizure. Now I'm going through chemo and radiation after already going through brain surgery to remove part of the tumor....some brain cancer is fatal, some is not.|`|99AEKeUWaa	Sounds like brain cancer. If you want to know different types of cancer, just name an organ and put the word "cancer" after it.
FicyC2TXaa	The chances of a 14 year old male getting breast cancer are as close to zero as makes no difference.<br>  <br>  Men do get breast cancer, but fewer than 1% of those diagnosed with breast cancer are male.<br>  <br>  And 80% of all people diagnosed with breast cancer are over 50; most men diagnosed with it are over 60.<br>  <br>  It's rare in women under 40, and almost unheard of in under 25s.<br>  <br>  So you can see how huge the odds against a 13 year old male getting breast cancer are. In fact, if you did have it, your case would be written up in medical journals worldwide because its extreme rarity would make it of enormous interest to the medical profession.<br>  <br>  Most breast lumps in men are actually a condition called gynaecomastia, a button-like growth under the nipple and areola area that can be felt and is sometimes visible to the naked eye and occasionally it can be quite tender.<br>  <br>  This increase in the amount of breast tissue is not a tumour and occurs due to changes in hormone balances at times like adolescence  - your age, in other words.<br>  <br>  It's not unusual and it's temporary. See your doctor for reassurance|`|cc07346154ea873f885bcde6cb7230b9aa	It could be because of something puberty-related, but it sounds like it's worth a trip to the doctor. Better safe than sorry.
QWaspeg7aa	Firstly, I would take a multivitamin with iron in it because deficiency in so many things, especially iron, results in tiredness so if that was a problem that would help it. Give them a couple of weeks though to take effect. <br>  Secondly, you sound really busy so make sure you're making time to eat, and to eat properly. I know if you've got loads on it's easy just to grab some chocolate or something, but the energy from sugar (and simple carbs) peaks and then crashes really quickly which will only make you ultimately more tired. Caffeine is the same, so try to limit that. Stick to proteins and complex carbs, so something like a tuna sandwich on wholemeal or rye or granary would be good, or even just an unsweetened yoghurt if you just want to grab a snack. Make sure you're getting enough fruit and veg too because you need a good mix of everything to make sure everything else gets into you and does what it should. <br>  Thirdly, are you sleeping properly? So, are you getting to bed at a decent time every night and getting up at a decent time too- it's worth getting up earlier a few days to get a regular 11pm- 7am (or whatever time works for you) going because a regular sleep pattern makes you feel really good- make sure that the sleep you get is worth having too, so make sure your bedroom isn't too hot or cold, that you don't drink alcohol or caffeine before bed, that you're as undisturbed as you can be. <br>  Fourth, try and make some time for something you enjoy doing- I know if you're tired and rushed it seems like this is the last thing you've got time for but some time for you is really restorative and is worth doing. If you can combine this with some physical exercise so much the better- exercise is ultimately energising rather than draining.<br>  I suggest these things because if you do eventually go and see a doctor you won't have wasted your time or money because you'll be able to say that you're doing everything you can. <br>  One other thing, I wonder if your tiredness is cumulative- maybe you've been tired since having the baby and because you've been trying to just get on with things you've never really corrected it and have become run-down? Are you able to maybe leave the baby with someone and have a few days or even just one to yourself, just to chill out, sleep and relax in? Ideally, I think you should have these few days and try the things I've suggested, then when the real world returns try to keep them up. If you're already doing all these, then I think you're only option would be to see a doctor, because these are all things that you can do yourself, and if you are run-down these should correct this. They're also pretty much all you can without any medical intervention. I hope you feel better soon (and please don't drive if you're falling asleep at the wheel- seriously. Imagine if that happened while your baby was in the car and you didn't catch yourself in time. I heard on the news today that 25% of all accidents are caused by tiredness. If you're tired, then you're less alert too). A stitch in time and all that...|`|Xuwk853xaa	Get as much resource as you can maybe is one  option,however it could be quite time consuming,here  <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a>  is one resource i have had good experience.
6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	Every hour?     Try a dermatologist.    -----------------    Are you talking about underarm odor?     We had a young man who came in because he had body odor. The doctor and I could not detect (by smelling) anything bad from him.     Another was given Hibiclens (brand name is Hibiclens and  Generic name is chlorhexidine) It's an antiseptic and bacteriostatic. This produce is normally used as a surgical scrub (to clean the skin for surgical procedure). This particular patient could not tolerate deodorant at all. All brands gave him rash under his arms. The doctor suggested that he used this soap (during shower) instead. It killed germs and kept working after it's rinsed (the active ingredient is bound to the protein of the skin). So it kept on working and basically kept him "fresh".     A small bottle of this is not expensive. Although it is over-the-counter, you will not see it on the shelve at most pharmacies. You have to ask for it. (Ask for Hibiclens). Use a little and wash under your arms when you shower. Leave it on for a minute. (No need to scrub and make yourself raw.) Rinse it off.     Dry yourself--and you can try to use "shower-to-shower" powder.     Of course, some people is known to have a reaction (rash) from it. Stop using it if that happens.
cf958f585e81f35dda5c9e48e6f15eb2aa	Most likely it has both. If it's an all natural grape juice with no added sweeteners in it then it should have only fructose (natural fruit sugar). But if it's a regular run of the mill juice it probably has added sugars in it.
7623Hd7naa	It depends on your weight, age and fitness level but in any case it's not very many calories. <br>  <br>  Sleeping is very important for losing weight because your body is actually very busy processing stuff while you are resting, so if you don't get enough sleep these processes are disrupted. There are many good articles online about it. One is below:|`|enbB895Paa	about 500. according to FitWatch|`|0qYCKcEXaa	Calories is a major topic when it comes to weight loss. We need to know three things: the number of calories in our food, the number of calories a specific activity expends each hour, and last but not least our own personal daily limit of calories. The sole thing that really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed twenty five pounds, it really does produce success!

t1FJZ8nuaa	They'll ask the victim to tell them what happened, give descriptions of everything. They'll do an internal exam but only if the victim is comfortable.  If the victim has the clothes that they were wearing at the time they will search the articles for any semen, hair, blood. They will literally check the victim from head to toe for any evidence that could help their case.  <br>  <br>  Also the victim will be given any medication for STIs and they will have them take a pregnancy test.  The entire exam can last all day long.|`|79677842fc75f4c703b1a6bba9de5d48aa	search it on google|`|maAarsJxaa	they do a few medical tests and investigate clothes, area it happened ect...

I mean you can get really fat from eating a lot of anything.  This might make your boobs look bigger.  But the rest of you will be bigger also.  I don't think that's what you're going for.  You're either born with the big boob gene or not.  When you get older (I'm assuming you're a young lady) and your body is finished developing and you are still unhappy there is always implants.
oLsMOmp8aa	I was the same way last summer when I was going into high school! I am 15 years old and I've lost 30 pounds since this June. Here's just about everything I did..    -Stay away from pop, including diet! Diet will not help you lose the pounds. Only drink water and skim milk.  -Eat a lot more fruits and vegetables  -Watch how much red meat you eat. Start eating more white meat, such as turkey and chicken.   -No more fast food. You can treat yourself sometimes but no large fries or whoppers. Eat less than what comes in a kids meal.  -Work out. Start walking or running a few times a week. It will shed the weight if you are eating right.    Tell your cousin good luck!|`|r3o10XbAaa	diet and exercise...|`|AA10018612	Change eating habits and exercise. That's it      No dieting!! You'll gain it back once you stop and then some!|`|aHWDZiLaaa	Atkins!!! and exercise!!!|`|aa29d6a547ed20a22d9f0cb13ee426f5aa	Heres an easy diet and exercise plan you can stick to. Eat a highly nutritous breakfast, oatmeal with nonfat milk or cereal with nonfatmilk with a fruit (apples are my first choice). If you drink coffee dont use sugar but rather a sugar subsitute like sweet and low. For lunch Eat two pieces of fruit (orange and banana) with a nonfat yogurt and water or diet soda.  For Dinner enjoy what ever is being served by your parents but only in smaller portions than you would normally. Do not drink soda or regular milk. I would switch to diet soda and nonfat milk. You will get used to the taste. For exercise, as soon as you get up in the morning do as many situps as you can (3 sets) and do as many girl pushups as you can 3 sets. In the evening ( before dinner ) do something for at least 12 minutes, (walking, dancing, treadmill. eliptical). It is important to do this at least six days a week.  If you stick to this program you will lose weight safeley pretty quick. Remember to be dedicated. Good luck! PS  It is very important not to skip any meals.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Wash your face and do not touch your face at all.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try applying grated cucumber over the acne or pimples for fifteen to twenty minutes and then washing with warm water. Its regular use prevents pimples and blackheads. More such solutions at http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/|`|JI7NQ9TNaa	Whoa.  How old are you?    Keep your skin clean, particularly if it seems oily in spots.  Try not to "over dry" it.  If you want a decent astringent, I suggest Sea Breeze, or witch hazel.  Wash your hands before you wash your face.  And drink eight glasses of water a day...hydration will make your skin clearer...      Good luck!|`|CS3W706xaa	try proactive it works|`|mC8iwbVCaa	I heard that when you have a pimple,  and it's just beginning to start,  to crunch up an aspirin until it's like powder,  and add a little bit of water so it turns into a paste,  and dab it right on there.  but don't wash it off,  just scrape it off when it has dried.    i haven't tried it before, but i heard it works!|`|r4HA3XH1aa	clean ur face daily....or if it gets to bad you can go to the dermotologist for a prescription....i did and i use differin and it works great!|`|hOQcOVjiaa	Get some type of face wash that is oil free..

Rinse with warm water and then quick with some cold water to close the pores.. Make sure you don't touch your face during the day. Keep your pillow case changed, and always pat dry with a towel don't rub your face with it.. I personally, also put on a small amount of     NIVEA FOR MEN   sensitive skin lotion   (no fragrance or dyes or harsh chemicals)     This is OK if you don't have an acne problem, but if you have some type of pimples or anything, I would recommend a very mild (non greasy) salicylic acid based lotion.. Or nothing at all. If your skin is really really bad, than try to arrange an appointment with a dermatologist.|`|PJDqFdX3aa	well right before i leave for school if i have a pimple or black head i but some ice on it then zap it with make-up, then when i'm at school i use a cold water bottle and then zap it with make-up!
IZfi37oaaa	as for ur food choices u are eating really well but today u were in fact not eating healthy.    there are two parts to eating healthy one is eating healthy food the other is to eat enough of that food to give u enough energy to make it through the day.    today for example you ate to little food/calories.. u need to eat more calories believe me (if u don't u will start to notice that ur metabolism is slowing down and u will become more tired then usual)    women should eat anywhere from 1600 -2000 calories a day anything under that is not healthy (and ur calorie count should be higher if u work out or run around alot at work)  men should eat anywhere from 2000-2400 calories a day    this may sound stupid but the key to loosing weight/staying healthy is to eat alot of healthy fruits and vegetables and excersize just cutting back on calories isn't good for ur body.. so try to keep that in mind  kk     good luck on eating healthy!! |`|3VMWTjKuaa	it sounds boring     u need to eat something little everyday   to indulge urself   like a piece of choclate or a little bowl of ice cream -- if u keep eating  and boring   or ull get sick of it and then just pig out one day .  u could also eat something sweet but healthy .

Raisin Bran has a lot of fiber in it too. maybe that would be a better choice|`|pXS9xa1Laa	No, i am a culinary arts major and take a nutrition class. First of all more than one fiber one bar in a day is too much fiber in your diet. Lean cuisine meals are actually worse for you than a lot of homemade foods.        You need to eat some meat like chicken, fish, or turkey for healthy proteins, also fish will give you a little omega 3 which is a good acid you need. Brown rice and beans is a good mix of grains and protein but try like i said to mix in a little meat as well.        For breakfast try more of like oats or wheat toast with maybe like sunbutter (just like peanut butter but from sunflower seeds delicious!)    I hope that helps, need nething else email me :)|`|cfn8mYF6aa	that sounds really healthy.    :)|`|rfOFuGNNaa	yeah, seems healthy too me|`|hvp9goB3aa	you ATE good =) what did you drink?|`|pOYsO3xzaa	hell yeah|`|vkMr3MCzaa	yupp|`|GSEBCYeUaa	you only want to have poweer bars once aa day...its should not take place for other food|`|zNxByOqOaa	maybe a bigger breakfast but still it's pretty healthy. :)|`|rzf4tMXGaa	You ate like you are on a strict diet..good if you're looking to loose weight  But if you're not, you should eat a bit more :)|`|tvOAeGAnaa	Absolutely|`|aGXqSi0Paa	yes you sooooo did watch opera theres an episode on how to eat good.|`|sAr3YV62aa	It looks healthy enough to me.

But I'd suggest eating carbs earlier in the day, not at dinner.  Other than that, there's a lot of protein and fiber, which is very good. Good up the good work!|`|uO3FC4draa	Add some milk, yoghurt or cheese and a green vegetable to round out the nutritional content.|`|jDTapCwzaa	yeah but i don't advise all the fiber one stuff because the cereal is loaded with aspartame really i heard it from a doctor. aspartame is bad for you and i heard the cereal had a ton of it so i don't know what else of the fiber one products have it also. just letting you know look up aspartame and you'll see what they say about it being bad for you

I have OCD, a social anxiety disorder, severe depression, and PTSD. Right now im currently on Fluxoetine and all it does is make me feel like a zombie so i can't express emotion. It does nothing for my anxiety or depression. What I am going to try is a herbal supplement called Kava Kava. It is supposed to help a lot with anxiety and its supposed to be similar to alcohol in effects. Give it a try.|`|68481fc8aad9b5f0e35d98211973ad7aaa	Chamomile calms nerves. B-12 also does this, corn products have a lot of B-12/Niacin in them. <br>  <br>  Sounds like your body is also sensitive to pharmaceuticals. It would be  a good idea for you to see an herbalist and study alternative therapies - legal ones.<br>  <br>  Zoda and others like him/her have probably misused the herbals or combined them with things that cancel them out. <br>  <br>  I am a big supporter of natural medicines because I am also sensitive to pharmaceuticals. <br>  <br>  Not the same issues, but similar.|`|HK30PzNraa	exercise.Seriously-going for at least a 35 minute walk or jog daily eases tension and anxiety.GOD-bless|`|awwz6Q7iaa	melitonin helps alot because it calms you|`|o1SmYvfOaa	Zath:  I couldn't agree more with you on your take on addictive pharmaceuticals that doctors and drug companies push. They work for some people but can be dangerous for others, like me. In my case my doctor pushed me into antidepresants and benzos that made me so tired and out of it that I could barely function.  Not to mention trying to quit taking that stuff. Its brutal.  Anyway I have since found a very good quality herbal remedy called Panicyl that works for my anxiety and panic attacks and allows me to function daily without any problems. You might want to check that out.  Take care and good luck.|`|7VMlrau3aa	You mention ''big pharma''  .herbals are a huge business & they dont work & they make outreageous claims & are also expensive!|`|jeyLZLDGaa	Dietary factors<br>  <br>  Caffeine consumption is one of the most common causes of anxiety. People who suffer from anxiety disorders tend to be unusually sensitive to the effects of caffeine, so even small amounts may cause problems for them. Withdrawing from caffeine can be difficult, as it usually results in severe headaches, lethargy, and other symptoms. I have learned, from a small series of cases, that caffeine-withdrawal headaches can be prevented by supplementing with Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) three times a day, beginning on the day of or the day before withdrawal, and continuing for a few days.<br>  <br>  Reactive hypoglycemia also appears to be an important cause of anxiety. (1) Hypoglycemia should be suspected in patients whose anxiety occurs or becomes worse before mealtime and is relieved by eating. Reactive hypoglycemia can be treated effectively by avoiding blood sugar-destabilizing foods (e.g., refined sugar, caffeine, and alcohol); eating small, frequent meals; and supplementing with chromium, B vitamins, magnesium, and other micro-nutrients.<br>  <br>  Food allergy may be a triggering factor for anxiety in some cases. (2) Allergy should be suspected if symptoms occur after eating or improve with fasting, or if a person has other manifestations of allergy, such as migraines, asthma, rhinitis, or irritable bowel syndrome. An elimination diet followed by individual food challenges can usually identify which foods are causing symptoms.<br>  <br>   Herbal Treatments<br>  <br>  Kava kava (Piper methysticum) has been shown in at least seven double-blind studies to be an effective treatment for anxiety. (6) Although kava kava was generally well tolerated in these studies, there have been rare reports of severe hepatotoxicity from the use of this herb. As a result, kava kava has been banned in some countries, although it is still available in the United States. Preliminary evidence suggests that the reported adverse effects were due to an idiosyncratic reaction, rather than to a toxic effect per se. Because there is no way at the present time to predict who might react to kava kava, people taking this herb should be alert for any early warning signs of hepatotoxicity, such as nausea, fatigue, dark urine, or right upper quadrant tenderness. Despite the rare but serious adverse reactions, kava kava appears to be better tolerated than benzodiazepines.
vEGkSHMsaa	Everyone has them, lower your body fat % to about 10-12% and they will show up. Do exercises that work your whole body and add muscle mass to your frame as well. It will be easier to get a lower body fat % that way, plus its healthier and looks better.|`|G1OSlub8aa	surgery..ab-etching is probably the fastest way, along with liopsuction. Crunches and a clean diet would be the cheaper way to go. A magic marker and some art skills is another way, although that would look stupid.|`|GHnPXNriaa	jack knifes
FPUgQnIFaa	It's probably a very deep bruise or a bone bruise. Sometimes colour will appear a few days later.<br>  <br>  Definately ice it and take it easy for a few days..<br>  They could have hit a muscle in your thigh or a nerve..<br>  <br>  Get well soon|`|YAcwm37Laa	u should use a stick to straighten it because bending it is bad or put hot oatmeal and wrap it around <br>  <br>  i know hes crazy but it works down right serious
sicqapoNaa	If I were you I would sit down with your father and very firmly explain that this is a very sensitive issue and making a big deal out of it is not what's going to give you confidence and helping towards the future, especially when it comes to an issue as important as this. If he can't be supportive then he needs to just hand over the money so you can buy this essential stuff and trust you.   Sorry if that came off a little harsh about your dad (I have some dad issues lol) but I do think it's an option.   P.S sorry don't know about the pills. I don't think you do as you can buy them over the counter at pharmacies.|`|ZpeVGitZaa	OMG! I had the same problem... my mom went 2 a convention 4 2 days & i 4got 2 tell her that i needed sum thingsss n i was like aaww man i only have my dad here with me lol So i was freaking out but i thought about it & i was like oookkk i have 2 do this,i took a deep breath and sat down in the living room with my dad and when i told him he seemed nervous lol. His words were scattered " um o o k umm so umm yeah what do u need ex-exact-ly uuhh what r those things called uumm yeah....Oh god imma call ur mother" LOL he was sweating like he was he was super nervous it was funny though after that day i never did talk 2 my dad about that kind of situation haha i always made sure i had what i needed b4 my mom left 4 a meeting thats farther than across town. So my advice 2 u is just tell ur dad what u need he might act like my dad did & u will get a little laugh out of the situation :) It'll work out fine trust me. But if ur still uncomfortable with talking 2 ur dad do u have a older sis or a aunt or older girl figure u can tlk 2 about it? If u do u should go tell them   Good Luck! :]
cbcZwg0laa	im sorry but plastic surgery. or look up how those jungle tribes did skull shrinking and see the bad things that will occur and i am sure there would be bad things such as your skull basically crushing the eyes, brain and other things you have inside of your head    but i am sure your head isn't big.
74cUgLOmaa	Well, it depends. If Your top row of teeth are perfectly straight,then yes. Even if your teeth are crooked, you can still get them if you have an overbite. You will just have to wear rubberbands to pull your teeth back. Let me tell you, they aren't the greatest.If you do have to get rubberbands, please be careful and pay attention to the list of foods you can't eat. If you don't, your rubberbands can pop, and trust me, it hurts like hell.|`|Ppstz3lCaa	hell yes  hope you look beautiful once they're gone|`|GiUTgnHMaa	no you need an expander but not braces.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	There is a muscle under  your breasts running above the ribcage and into the upper chest.  Women that body build usually end up having smaller breasts because this muscle grows and flattens the breast tissue.  However, I don't think that you intend to go to those extents, so you could have a good theory, that losing body fat percentage will also include some breast fat.    good luck..|`|O6gERzWCaa	there is an easy test you can do.... try jumping, if they bounce too much that means that there are less mamary glands than fat... so you might lose size... but if they dont really move, you wont loose as much, genetics also influence these situations, and kids too...
MXRXG62oaa	this happened to me twice. it lasted about 2 days the first time. the second time it lasted about a week. if its brown, i dont think you got cut. brown generally means old blood, whereas red is fresh blood.  should not be longer than a week, unless its leading into your regular period

PnnywVXSaa	Sounds like a run of the mill virus. The key is to treat your systems AND help your immune system. Take lots of Vitamin C (I know some people say it doesn't work but it has always helped me). Don't forget to eat nutritious food! Your body needs fuel to fight. Also, make sure your meds have a decongestant for your nose and guaifenesin to dislodge what's in your chest. Airborne would help boost your immune system too. Drink hot teas to soothe your throat, and add honey if you can because the good bacteria will help kill what in there. And don't forget to sleep. Hope you feel better.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	This is a remedy we use in our Latino culture.  Boil 1 cup of water  with 2 tablespoons of honey. Then squeeze in 1/2 lime. Then drink it. This soothes the throat and cleans your nose up. Then get some Vaporub and rub it on your throat if it hurts as your drinking the remedy and cover it with a scarf. This will also help you sweat that out. Good luck!
1aI1FSuAaa	is your jaw rubbing and clicking upon movement? if yes ,than you got it babe.|`|capqMpiCaa	wth is TMJ|`|qKpRCwVXaa	Well, from the looks of it TMJ, or Temporomandibular joint diseases are often rather difficult to diagnose as there is no definitive test for TMJ as a patient's medical history, symptomology, and physical examinations may be needed in addition to other tests to rule out other medical conditions, so you would need to see a medical doctor and/or specialist to find out. Hope this helps and best of luck to you.|`|jSPsJHadaa	I don't think you really can know for sure unless you have the doctor diagnose you. I thought I had TMJ, because my jaw would constantly pop, but it turned out not to be that. Sometimes if you have ringing in your ears a lot you could possibly have it. I would just ask the doctor, because I don't think there's another way to know.|`|h3WLRshSaa	me and my brother both thought we had it when we were in the 13-16 range. we got it checked out and it's fine. it was just ajusting because of our age. if you are not in your teens, i suggest going to the doc.

It is possible for our insides to shift around once they've been disturbed by surgery, but it isn't likely for them to do so with no trauma.  Please get yourself looked at.

Every year you need to avoid the public during cold and flu season. Wash your hands frequently. Keep in close touch with your doctor so he/she can keep you apprised of your deterioration. Go on steroids to keep the inflammation down. Take albuterol treatments 3-4 times a day. Have your wife learn postural drainage so she can help you clear the mucous. You're going to be spending a lot of time in the hospital so you might as well have a bag packed to take with you when 911 comes.  Or you can stop smoking.|`|plwuZ0Kuaa	Oh it could be a number of things including medicines you are curently taking. ( I seen the comment about albuterol) Not so good if you are elderly The tabs have been banned from the FDA but the breathing treatments are ok to use . Do you have a nebulizer? Do you take Tranxene(cloraz Dipot) ?? Certain prescription will take the vitamins and minerals out of your body lowering your imune system.    My mom was the same way .

Gotta get a prescription medication from a doctor. It's no big deal.|`|AA11239388	you need to go to the doctor girl. seriously. don't worry about it being embarrassing, it happens to people all the time. but seriously, that can cause some very serious health problems if you really have worms. they can eat THROUGH your insides, and cause ulcers, hemoraging, and internal bleeding. this is nothing to play around with. it's an illness really. no more imbarrassing than the flu, or tetnis. you can get them even from just walkin outside barefoot, or eating something that might have an egg or larva on/in it. so don't worry about people lookin down on you, and go to the doctor. besides, the doctor, nurse, and receptionist are the only one that will really even know why you're there. ya know??? so just do yourself a favor and go tet it checked out. for real.|`|pha427Puaa	Depends on the parasite. There is an OTC treatment for pinworms, however for other roundworms, tapeworms and flukes, it'll require laboratory identification and prescription from a doctor for the appropriate anti-helminth.|`|oC11Lcf2aa	Yikes!|`|PnnywVXSaa	The problem with this is that worms can actually be very dangerous. If they multiple enough, they could end up starving your body from the inside out. They can also get lodged in places like organs that can cause you severe damage. Yes, there are ways to kill parasites with herbs and things, but you may not get them all. You really should schedule an appointment with a doctor ASAP in order to keep them from doing anymore harm. Just because you feel ok, does NOT mean your body is ok with them being there. There could already be irreversible damage done. And don't be embarrassed. These things are a lot more common then you think. People traveling overseas often pick one up. The good news is that they are easy to treat when you go to a doctor, and they can check to be sure they are gone for good.|`|8LhEs3WLaa	If you have worms you would know as every night when you are warm and toasty in bed, your bum will start to itch like crazy. You can also check your bowel motions (poo), if you have worms you will see little white wriggly things in it. They used to say to worm the family periodically but new research says not to use medication until you physically have worms. It is nothing to be embarrassed about as most people will have worms at least once in their lifetime. Worm eggs live under the fingernails which can be picked up from many places, so do not chew your nails and always wash your hands  properly. Worms are like nits, they are unfortunately part of life, not a disease to be ashamed of. You can buy medication over the counter from your local chemist such as combantrin. Good Luck!|`|yLDj2vRRaa	Nothing to get embarrased about going to a doctor. Go! Parasites could be dangerous to your health. You need to have some tests done to determine if you really have parasites. It could be something else more serious not parasites.<br>  <br>  However if you want to take a risk that it is really a parasite infection, try taking COMBANTRIN (generic PYRANTEL) BY Pfizer. It is an over the counter drug. Take the syrup type, it is more effective than the tablets.|`|bFyPdIa5aa	I learned in college in a medical class that 9 out of 10 people have a parasite and they don't even know it.. <br>  Some signs were constant constipation, and itch anus... You need to go to the doctor and let him give you something. It's from eating meat that wasn't cooked properly..  Or playing in dirt..|`|ArKT9O7Maa	No,  not really.

LeFkaKhOaa	Hey. Your lucky I found your question, because I myself am touched by TS. Your best resource is the Turner Syndrome Society of the US. Their website is www.turnersyndrome.org. They will have all of the information you probably need! Turner Syndrome is a chromosomal disorder in which all or part of the 46 chromosome is missing. It only effects females, and has two types: Classic TS and Mosaic TS. Classic is when all or part of the 46 X chromosome is missing. Mosaic TS is when all of the 46 X chromosome is missing in some cells, and other cells are normal. The most common side effect is short stature. For example, I'm 14, but I'm only 4'6 tall. To learn more again visit www.turnersyndrome.org. Hope I helped. And good luck with your project!|`|XNfjaPaSaa	TS affects many systems of the body.

nEVoabeSaa	No you do not have Spina Bifida!<br>  Occulta is Latin for "hidden." This is one of the mildest forms of spina bifida although the degree of disability can vary depending upon the location of the lesion. In occulta there is no opening of the back, but the outer part of some of the vertebrae are not completely closed. The split in the vertebrae is so small that the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it; there may be a dimple in the skin, a lipoma, a dermal sinus or a birthmark. Many people with the mildest form of this type of spina bifida do not even know they have it. This was picked up on a x-ray, but if you had Spina Bifida you would have known since birth.

uVmwUqhIaa	In general, new piercings swell, appear red, become tender, and expel a bit of blood. All of this is perfectly normal. Cartilage piercings do take the longest to heal. The blood supply to cartilage is nearly nonexistent, making piercings here slower and harder to heal. This bleeding and redness is certainly from the irritation. Just make sure to clean your piercing twice a day to ensure that this irritation does not lead to an infection. Just as a heads up, do not use alcohol or peroxide. These are more damaging than good. The yellowish discharge is dead WBCs. This discharge will be abundant throughout the healing process. Once the piercing has healed, you will still find trace amounts on your earring.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NVxGp317aa	Cartliage piercings do take longer to heal. Basically everytime you roll on to it at night or even when you clean it you cause a little irritation. Don't panic keep cleaning it like you were instructed make sure to keep hair away from it and try not to sleep on it but you can't help what happens at night.|`|sXZ5bkobaa	i got my cartilage pierced in december, and it still frequently bleeds. i swear they take forever to heal! i still can't sleep on it or i wake up in the morning with it exremely swollen and red. give it time and just keep cleaning it, it'll heal eventually.

Second, being a virgin isn't a bad thing.  In fact, most cultures put their virgins up on a pedestal.  Don't rush into having sex, or else you'll both feel awkward about the whole thing.  Wait until you're ready, and use protection.  Plus, being 17, if you become sexually active it's a good idea to start seeing a gynecologist if you don't already.  You can usually talk to your gynecologist about things you don't want to ask a friend or your parents.  And don't be embarrassed, they've heard it all!|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Ignore everyone else.

wwRbkCMraa	Always stick with a whey protein first.  then you can add it to anything you want.  I was able to go from 135 lbs to 175 lbs in one summer.

(this is the most important, if taken after those 15 mins then it won't have the special effect) The special effect s that your muscles will instantly soak up anything you take which will give 5 times greater results.<br>  <br>  So you would take three scoops on days that you are training<br>  <br>  And for added benefit you should eat cottage cheese, at night(on nontraining days) instead of whey because it contains casein which is protein that is slow to release, so forth protecting your muscles as you sleep
VdnAH78Xaa	Hey.<br>  i used pads for the first few years of my period. i could never figure out how to get the tampon in haha. it is normal to be nervous. just take a deep breath. while your on the toilet spread your legs apart. if you have to use one hand to open your vagina hole a little then with the other insert the tampon in until your thumb touches your body then with your finger push the tampon in. the string should be left hanging out. and when you get up and start walking around you shouldn't feel it. if you do and if its uncomfortable take it out and try again.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	If you've never had sex (and it sounds like you're too young) then don't use tampons. It's a silly way of losing virginity. Just use pads for the moment.|`|y8HyP1bzaa	First of all, nobody says you HAVE to use tampons.  It's a totally personal choice.  Some women love them and some women hate them.  There is nothing wrong with pads, if that's what you are comfortable with.<br>  <br>  But if you want to try and use tampons, the first thing you need to do is relax.  It will probably take several attempts before you get it in correctly, and it may take even longer before you feel comfortable wearing them.  There will be an instruction sheet inside the box when you buy it, and that should help you.  Follow the directions and you should be okay!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|dG6GqOAPaa	its absolutely normal to feel nervous the first time. i'm thirteen and i used pads for the first year that i've had my period. i would say get playtex gentle glide tampons. thats what i used the first time i tried tampons. what i did was i took off my undies and sat with my legs open and i used a mirror and i tried to put it in. it took me about 3 times to get it in just right but what i learned was that you kind of aim down with the tip of the tampon and slide it all the way in meanwhile pushing the applicator and when u push that, you don't even realize its in.|`|1aJjFrUCaa	i think everyones nervous to use tampons. i was forced to use tampons bc that was the only way we could go to slitterbalm lol. i was on my period and i had to go. soo i made my mom help me put it in my first time haha. Lift one leg onto a the toliet or bathtub and put your tampon in like vasaline or something and it should slide right in with a lil push. and no problem. i love tampons they're not as messy as pads. just make sure you change your tampon like 3-4 times a day. depending on the heavyness of your period.|`|g8pRhElsaa	absolutely! i was nervous the first time too. you just gotta keep practicing and trying to do exactly what it says on the box, and sooner or later it'll be no big deal.|`|Ti9WkcoAaa	Being nervous and scared the first time you us a tampon is a normal feeling.  I would suggest that you purchase "Tampax Slenders"  or Playtex Slenders.  Try a plastic applicator (Playtex), they are easier to insert then the cardboard one. You may also want to put a vaginal lubricant on the applicator until you're used to using the tampon.  Full instructions are included in the tampon box

dCLnLlsCaa	It's cancer of the lungs.  My grandpa had it, we knew something was wrong because he was coughing for months.  He was also losing his appetite, tired all the time.  We found out way too late, he never went to the dr. and he was diagnosed in March, passed away in May.  He smoked his whole life but had quit 25 years prior to the diagnosis.  If you feel you are at high risk (i.e. a smoker, former smoker, second hand smoke) you should get a lung scan and check it out.  The sooner they find it, the sooner they can try and remove all of it.  Otherwise, it spreads fast.|`|UiWbfi3Raa	lung cancer is cancer in your lungs and then once the cancer is in your lungs then you will not be able to breath|`|IpXsPG8qaa	There are many different types of lung cancer. Basically as you know, you have two lungs. Your right lung has three lobes: upper,middle, and lower and your left lung has two lobes: upper and lower. A lot of different things can cause lung cancer such as smoking and exposure to chemicals, etc. People with lung cancer can become extremely short of breath, experience excruciating chest pains, have episodes of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), etc. Many times a tumor grows in your lung and attaches itself to your lymph nodes. Also, the cancer is capable of spreading to other parts of your body such as your liver and brain. The best way to remove the cancer is to undergo a surgical procedure. Many times, the tumor containing the cancer can be fully removed and you may never have another problem with cancer in your life. However, most doctors prefer to monitor you for 10 years after resection to be certain the cancer hasn't returned. There is a 10-15% chance that the cancer will return within the first 2 years after resection.

A urinary tract infection is an infection that begins in your urinary system. Your urinary system is composed of the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Any part of your urinary system can become infected, but most infections involve the lower urinary tract  the urethra and the bladder.    Antibiotics are typically used to treat UTIs. I suggest you see your primary care physician.     Though, if you can't make a doctor's visit, I'd suggest googling home remedies to try for maybe a week to see if it helps.     Drinking cranberry juice can help when you have a UTI because a substance present in cranberry juice prevents bacteria from adhering to the walls of the bladder so that infections aren't as likely to occur.  Good luck.|`|urrmckQBaa	cystitis, drink loads of cranberry juice and it will soon clear up.|`|defae93221649626bf40294eaaa8ae9daa	you have an infection... go to a doctor. drink water.|`|gYnUr3cuaa	why don't you ask a doctor ?|`|Z2DOSjRfaa	I agree it sounds like a urinary tract infection.

If you want big and saggy, go for fattier foods and eat way more than you burn each day, but be warned that this weight may go anywhere in your body. If you want big and round, you need to start working those muscles. Squats and lunges are great exercises to tone your butt.
eZDoQPg8aa	Sounds pretty normal to me.  I've had that done twice and had no problem either time as long as I listened and stayed off the foot for the 1st 24 hours.    Just keep the bandage clean, soak the foot if the doctor told you to (mine wanted me to soak it daily in hot water and epsom salts) and it should be healed in a couple of weeks.  Watch for redness, swelling, pus or a yellow discharge and of course, pain.  Those are all signs of infection and if you get any of those, call the doctor.
fTW94Jdtaa	To prevent yourself from overeating during the day eat smalls meals consistently throughout the day with ALOT of water.  Typically, the recommended meals per day is 6 smalls meals.  Eating small portions of meals and snack about every 2 hours will do wonders.  For snacks almonds, carrots, protein bar is good.      The reason 6 small meals is preferred is because you keep your bodies metabolism constantly going and in the "burning" phase.  Since your eating pretty much the entire day but SMALL meals by the time lunch time comes around you will find your not as hungry or starving as you would normally be.  Drinking alot of water helps as well!  Get rid of the sodas, gatorades, or anything containing sugar, high corn fructose(fancy work for sugar), glucose(sugar) and replace it with good old fashion water.  Water also makes you feel fuller throughout the day.     Also, add running, jogging, or workout to your above diet and you should be good!  Remember lean meats, grilled(not fried) chicken, steamed veggies, tuna, anything like that is good.  The one muscle on your body you could workout almost everyday is your Abs!    I hope the info helps!|`|XZHx3v4Raa	eat a sandwich on whole wheat bread(50 calories for the bread each)  add light mayo.  have some fruit like grapes,orange,or apple  plus a bar in low calories.  with water bottle.  maybe a side salad|`|I54KyS8Laa	Breakfast:  An egg with whole grain bread or your half cup of oatmeal, millet is also great.   Lunch--whole grain bread with almond or cashew butter and a piece of fruit.. or can of sardines in water or tomato sauce--no peanuts as they have mold and a lot of people are really allergic and don't know it.   Dinner--salad without dressing--flavor with oregano, cracked pepper, salt (Morton lite salt), crushed red pepper, small amount of nuts...  one serving of chicken, fish, turkey, or pork--stay away from deli meats--they're high in salt. Do not drink diet drinks--they actually make you gain weight. Use stevia as a sweetener. Back to dinner. Definitely a vegetable like broccoli, green beans, collard greens, carrots, and small serving of potatoes, sweet potatoes or rice.

AA11176387	I just was trying to help someone with myastenia gravis and in the course of reading the save your life manual from the man who cured the incurables, he said b vitamins are very important for nerve diseases but he stressed never with vit b pills which do nothing.    He recommended foods like molasses but said the very best source of vit b is nutritional )(torula) yeast.  It is often sold in the bulk at health food stores and is yellow flakes.  I would also take lecithin granules as this is a great source of choline and inositol (b vitamins)    Just blend it into smoothies, juice, applesauce, peanut butter etc.

w9cicy0Daa	Quicker than what?  Fruits have two factors that cause this, the seeds are inside and the fruit starts to break down to allow reproduction; in these conditions molds are a help because they produce the pectinase that starts the breakdown. Fruits also have a low pH and molds can grow better in low pH conditions. Normally moulds grow best on unwashed fruits, washing can inhibit mold growth for a while, as can refrigeration.

AA11301302	The questions you are asking are entirely normal and are very human. Most of the questions you are asking are the questions asked by the great philosophers, theologians, and novelists of the past 2,000 years. In the world we live in today, people are so consumed with the media, with money, and other superficial pursuits, that they stop asking questions of existence. That makes you feel like YOU'RE the strange one, but actually I believe it is more "normal" to question reality, to question if this life is real or a dream, etc. than to just accept life as if it's normal.    Secondly, if you are spending a lot of time by yourself at home, it's easy to get trapped in your head and to become philosophical or contemplative. Sometimes this can cause anxiety - as it is obviously causing you - so try to get out more, maybe volunteer or help out someone in need. Get outside of your head and focus outward on a project or on a person who is less fortunate than you. Also, you can write down your thoughts and ideas in a journal to help you process them.    Never let anyone - not a doctor, therapist, friend, parent, etc -- make you think you are "Crazy" for questioning life and reality.|`|jBesM9Raaa	First off the worse thing you can do is self diagnose yourself. Leave that for professionals. I beleive the part of not having a job and spending time alone and avoiding social situations can be the reason you question so many things. To much free time can be bad on your mind. The best thing to do is get involved with something, like sports and activity, or a job. Its perfectly normal to question things, its called philosophy, you might just have a powerful mind, so be thankful and put it to use, like art. Hope this helps.|`|3ZWBRRfsaa	You're not the only person who has ever had strange thoughts that you know can't make true sense.  I used to ask my mom what would be left when the world ends.  She would answer,  "nothing".  Okay,  then I would go into this:  Nothing?  Nothing is something right?  Since nothing is something,  what does nothing look like?  If someone asks what you are doing and you say nothing then that is something because that is what you are doing,  "nothing". Do I have you confused yet?  LOL!   I also used to fear (as a child) that I was in a dream.  I was scared that I would wake to find that nothing was as I thought and the people that I loved wouldn't really exist.  It's as hard to comprehend as something hasn't happened yet.  Say for instance,  you think of how you would feel if something happened to the person you love the most (like a child or a parent).  The anxiety that builds from a thought like that can just about drive you crazy.  I think everyone does this from time to time. The love we feel for others make us dread the possibility of loss.  Now,  there will be some responders to this question that will probably make fun or call us crazy.  However,  almost everyone has had some kind of ridiculous thought(s) in their life time.  They may not admit it but I don't think there is any reason not to.  After all,  there are questions about this life that we may never know the answers to.        Staying home a lot may also be disconnecting you from the outside world making you feel alone.  It would probably help to get out more.  Nature walks are fantastic.  If you are near a beach walk through the sand barefoot and experience the feeling of sand on your feet.  Or the grass in your own yard.  Feel and touch real things and realize that it is all real.  Besides that,  if it was a dream,  would you want to trade anything for it?  If this was all a dream I would cherish the love and laughter that I feel now.  I would never forget the people that I know.      Oh,  I forgot,  do you ever feel like the world is like a big snow globe and we are inside of it.  And that maybe someone is watching from the outside as we all scurry around like ants to live every day.  Or do you feel like we are all just government experiments?  Like maybe we all just have a number?  Or that maybe government controls the population?  There has to be cures for cancer or aids doesn't there?  They can kill aids with cold sterile solutions in hospitals so there has to be something right?  However,  if they keep it hid they can control the population and insurance companies can make tons of money.  What about all of the contaminated foods that actually make it to the store and kill people?  For example,  the most recent,salmonella in peanut butter products. Salmonella in bagged lettuce.    By now you either think that I need to look up mental disorders or you are realizing that you are not crazy or alone is your thoughts.  We are only human.  Nobody is perfect.  We are all different and that's what makes the world go round.  If we were all the same this world would be so boring.  Questions like yours are great.  They really get a lot of people to step down from the perfectly organized day that they had and realize that they too are not perfect or alone in silly thoughts.      I think you'll be fine really.  I think that getting out will help.  Talk to some older people who can tell you stories about the good old days.  Then you'll know it must be real.  Go out and feel real things and enjoy them.  Just the warmth of the sun can be so nice.      Good luck,  I hope you are able to get past the toughest parts of your thoughts.  They will probably always be there but you'll learn to not obsess your self with them.  Sure you'll think of them from time to time but only for short amounts of time.      Hope this helps.|`|J758mw2Naa	Ok, you must not be able to see this but you have alot of time on your hands and have made something to pre-occupy yourself...

HA2IV3r3aa	There are many theories about how allergies form, but "most" people are not allergic.  Less than 1% of children are allergic to peanuts and most have a non-lethal reaction.  Out of that 1% about a quarter of them will grow out of their allergy.|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	I don't know. One day I ate peanut butter, the next thing I know my throat was closing up. That was at the age of 32. God how I wish I was a kid again.|`|464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	In the United States, food allergies affect almost 2 % of the general population. Among all food allergies, peanut allergy is the third most prevalent allergy occurring among young children and the most common food allergy in older children, adolescents and adults, with the median age of first allergic reaction being 14 months. Among children who have peanut allergies, approximately 75% will experience a reaction on their first exposure with the potential outcome being severe or fatal. There is an estimated 2 fold increase in reported peanut allergies among Westernized nations, with the most likely culprits being peanuts used as a source of protein in health foods, the popularity of vegetarianism and the increased used of prepared foods.     Although the complete elimination of peanuts from the diet can be difficult, identification and elimination of foods are the most appropriate treatment for peanut allergy. Injectable epinephrine and a written emergency plan in case of accidental ingestion should be given to children with asthma and IgE mediated food allergies. Patients should be aware of the biphasic nature of the reaction and they should contact their physician after the emergency treatment is completed.    People who have allergies to peanuts should wear a Medic-Alert Bracelet or Necklace .|`|TT6Nk0JNaa	Peanuts are a common allergy, because they are in a lot of things, but the amount of people allergic to peanuts is nowhere *near* a majority.

newfiOPOaa	If you donate blood to the Red Cross you would receive a blood donor card with your blood type on it.   Of course this is at no cost to you. You can also purchase a home test kit.   These kits can be accurate if used properly.    You may be more comfortable with the results from a testing laboratory.    You would have to have a doctor order a blood test in that case.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Doctor needs a blood sample to be able to give you accurate info.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	You have to have a blood test done at the donor clinic, unless it's on your birth certificate, or licence, etc.

RGRmNR3kaa	Um.  How do you know you make too much insulin.  Is this what a doctor told you?  Diabetes is not caused by too much insulin.  You need to do some more research.  In the meantime you need to diet and exercise since you are overweight.|`|8OqdoIHtaa	The black skin is called acanthosis nigracans, it  means you have elevated blood sugar AND elevated insulin. The first one causes the second one.     You can read more about it here...    http://www.aocd.org/skin/dermatologic_di...    You are prediabetic, which is just another way of saying you are nearly diabetic, but your blood sugar isn't quite high enough to be officially diagnosed as diabetic...  yet.     Its higher than it should be, and its already causing some damage, and symptoms, such as the elevated insulin and dark skin.     You are "insulin resistent". This means that your insulin doesn't work well, so your body has to make extra insulin because your blood sugar is rising and getting out of control. The insulin continues to rise, but because its not very effective or your body can't utilize it properly, the sugar still climbs.     If this continues untreated, you'll officially become a full blown diabetic, and your pancreas could eventually stop making insulin at all.     You feel sick when you don't eat, because your blood sugar is dropping. Not too low, just lower than your body has gotten used to.     If you eat too much starch or sugar, you might start to feel sick from that too. These things were both happening to me just before I was diagnosed.     The best thing you can do is to start an exercise plan, with lots of walking, which will help get your blood sugar down, and start to eat a more moderate carb diet. The South Beach Diet, phase 2 might be a really good place to start. The book has all you need to know to get started, including meal plans and recipes.     I'd skip phase 1, as its very extreme.     You probably will become a diabetic eventually, but if you get more active, and reduce your carbs, you might be able to get your blood sugar down to healthier levels and delay the onset of full diabetes.     I'd recommend that you get a blood sugar meter to test at home.     The Therasense Freedom Lite is really easy to use, fast, doesn't require coding, uses the tiniest blood sample, and alllows arm testing, which is less painful than finger testing.     You can see one here...   http://abbottdiabetescare.com/content/en...    These meters are usually free if you buy 100 test strips.   The test strips are expensive, but necessary if you want to get this under control.     I have some book titles for recommended reading on my blog, including a book by Gretchen Becker which should be helpful...   http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-NbDgUzQhf...      Before you start exercising, and changing your diet, talk to your doctor and get the go ahead.     Metformin might help and you can talk to your doctor about that too. Its an oral medication used for diabetes and sometimes used in pre-diabetes. If diet and exercise don't help, he might put you on it. Its the gold standard of oral medications for type 2 diabetes.|`|F2QtzNyXaa	that doesn't sound too good, the only thing i could think of with the black under your armpits and neck would either be from a blood clot, bacterial infection (especially under your armpits) but i am not a doctor that's in my opinion what i think i may be.  see a doctor|`|7oYpbSjIaa	sounds like you are resistant to insulin and really need to start working on losing weight.  that's one of the only things that can help you at this point.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Eat meals at regular times.

Each person is different, and in many cases, the benefits outweigh the risks.    http://www.safefetus.com/|`|8ba928db9d608ffb27aaa0e4d3853221aa	I am a male but I happen to know that this is very dangerous to do.   Anti depressants are extremely dangerous drugs and using them during pregnancy can kill both you and the baby.     Throw them away and fire your doctor immediately since the idiot is probably only giving them to you so he/she can collect illegal kickbacks from the drug company anyway.|`|3dzuYTC5aa	Its really hard to take any meds while pregnant...

5jf5tcMnaa	A digital PAN is around $150 here.  Once a patient pays for an X-ray (and it might be argued even if they don't pay for it!) it is their property.  If they want it the dentist has to send it along to another office or give it to the patient.  The chart is the property of the dentist and he/she will hang onto that, although for a fee they can make photocopies for the patient.  But the X-rays are the patients.  If the dentist wants them then they can keep or make a copy of them for his/her files.    Thanks Dr. Mike.  I know, some people just go around giving thumbs down.  Kinda takes the fun out of answering people's questions.  Trixie makes a good point that I kind of alluded to.  Even if the patient owes the dentist money, they can not hold the X-rays for ransom until the debt is paid.  This is because it could jeopardize their care.  Either they would go and have unnecessary X-rays taken else where, or they wouldn't seek treatment anywhere else.  So really if a patient asks for the X-rays, the dentist must hand them over.|`|0d4c9f6122693a445077a17a9d8ceb08aa	I just paid $95 for one a few months ago. The dentist has an ethical obligation to give you that x-ray if you ask for it. I just picked mine up today. It varies from state to state, please call your state dental board. They are very helpful. There is a limit (in my state, it is $20), that they can charge you for a copy of your records, including x-rays or molds. Yes, you can pick those up yourself; you will have to sign a release form, but you do not have to tell them who you are going to. Also, if you owe them money, don't let them try to tell you that they will not release your records until you pay. That is just not true. I have talked to the American Dental Association and my state dental board this week. Patients have rights.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	I am not a dentist or a dental worker, but boy do I go to the dentist a lot, and I can tell you mine charges around $100 for x-rays.

HDyqzvUkaa	These thoughts seem like your average philosophical search for answers to the previously unexplored.     If you are truly bothered by having these random thoughts, you should probably learn a bit about philosophical thinking as regards to reason (which is not common sense and is a skill which can be learned)    the color blue is only called blue, it isn't the letters "b.l.u.e"    These things are only stupid if you continue to dwell on the same question without analyzing it from multiple angles and creating an answer for yourself...|`|J758mw2Naa	Uhh I do this all the time too. lol, so I mean it's fine.    Just try not to worry about it...    Keep asking questions. it will get you far in life, and you'll be a very intelligent person.|`|HJrTuihcaa	you just have a wild imagination :) its alright, im like this!|`|AA11301302	Don't be worried. Every person is created uniquely and distinctly and has their own ways of thinking.     Sometimes anxiety comes when we feel we are alone, or no one is taking care of us, or no one really knows us or loves us unconditionally. God knows you and loves you unconditionally, so maybe it would help you feel more at ease to think about that. If you have a bible, read the book of John, about how Jesus came from heaven to be with us and reconcile us to our Father.     You're not abnormal for having "random" thoughts, but just give those thoughts to God and ask Him to give you peace, and you will feel better.
HDyqzvUkaa	balance   do other things that make you feel alive.

Do what you want, not what others want of you. Set your own morals. These are all things that have helped me. Also, look at the small things in life. Be grateful for sleeping in those five minutes, smile when you see a cute baby, start small talk with the people in the elevator. If you dont have one thing that you love with a passion of one thousand suns, find it. You dont have to be great at it, you dont even have to be good at it. Just do it. It doesnt matter what others think; its your thing, not theirs. My last words are ones that have helped me become who I am, and have made me live life to the absolute fullest.  Live without regret. Love without restraint. Die without fear.
0xFQj585aa	Cutting causes the release of endorphins which makes you feel good. It can be addictive and very hard to stop. What you describe is how a lot of people feel. You asked not to be told to go see someone so I won't. But you should know that there are a lot of people you can talk to who won't judge you.|`|ULx2vAB1aa	it releases endorphins in your brain, causing you to feel better after you cut. plus, it releases pain, causing you to feel better|`|GlKq5stKaa	It takes the frustration out of your mind by making you focus on something else.

Fill that void in your life with something more positive, like relationships.|`|te2aIm0Maa	It gives you confidence maybe...it makes you feel courageous.

I believe that I've been cutting for 6 years.and if it didn't make me happy I probably wouldn't still be doing it.

rGvlPAMJaa	Sounds like gum disease. Brush very very well and FLOSS. Purchase a good mouthwash such as Listerine Advanced and gargle twice a day. It will help you out. You can go to the dentist while pregnant, just make sure no x-rays! And inform them of your pregnancy, checkups aren't too expensive.|`|QNGzjvRKaa	I'm no dentist but you could try getting a softer bristle brush.  Make sure you're brushing the teeth and not the gums.  Try to find a dentist who will let you pay something each month - if you have a medical problem in there it's not going to go away without proper care and treatment.|`|lm0nlP04aa	Sounds like you may have early gum disease.  But I agree that you should switch to a softer brush, and make sure you floss.  Maybe try gargle/rinsing daily with hydrogen peroxide to help kill any bacteria in your mouth to see if it helps at all.  But do not swallow it.|`|tmzdPz0baa	Pregnancy takes a toll on your body and your teeth!  Since you're still in your first trimester, go see a dentist for a cleaning, etc.  The dentist can recommend rinses & other things to keep your teeth healthy and strong.

Unlike a hallucination, which is a distortion in the absence of a stimulus, an illusion describes a misinterpretation of a true sensation. For example, hearing voices regardless of the environment would be a hallucination, whereas hearing voices in the sound of running water (or other auditory source) would be an illusion.|`|BOaaKdViaa	maybe you are telepathic|`|aqqOl9L2aa	That's happened to me too.

yPsbcrkkaa	You say you eat white meat.....that is fowl (chicken, turkey etc) right?  Most of those fowl have been given growth hormones in order to make them grow faster and bigger. When you eat the meat it does the same for you!!! I suggest you only eat organic white meat (that will mean no such additives...if the companies are being honest!  Cut out all the greasy food and fried food and start eating more vegetable salads and if you wanna eat meat, grill or roast it. Eat the salad first so you are not so hungry when you start on the meat.  Do not eat any white bread or white flour products. It is BAD! Instead go for whole-grain bread. By the way, beans (such as kidney beans) and rice when eaten together form a perfect protein....in other words they are protein like meat so try that instead of meat. Tofu is a good alternative to meat also for a nice burger. Try whole grain buns with onion, lettuce, mushroom and tofu with soy sauce for a really nice healthy burger!|`|MMdWfD1baa	NO greasy foods, no dessert, no sodas or bread.  The stuff in the bread can turn to sugar.  (Homemade fries are ok, however, with little salt).|`|yZrVMIs1aa	wait what?  how confusing anyhoobers if you have a "trainer" he will know unless if by trainer you mean your chunky girlfriend.|`|sLrPhfnDaa	See there's the answer hidden in your question "greasy food!"Avoid food that has any kind of oils in it.Fried foods should be off your list atleast until you get your body fat down to 7% as you want.Also whenever you eat sweet things don't forget to check the calorie content in it,even more than oily foods,sweetned foods make you fat!|`|fbXYElEOaa	Carbs are not the enemy on this one!

K8C14P7Caa	I used whole wheat flower in a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving...I did not like the consistency, but I did like the taste...it is a more coarse flower and does not bind as well as regular white flour...I don't have the time to experiment. If you do...I am jealous.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Yes it does make it healthier. It makes things so dense.  It really doesnt taset as good as white flour.  i have gotten used of it but llike the "real stuff" much better.  I make stuff with it for my kids, they like it.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Yes, it is much healthier.  Higher in fiber, its carbohydrates are complex, it has more nutrients in it.  And it does actually taste as good.. even better.  The problem is that when you aren't used to eating healthy foods, the simple carbos you are used to have messed with your palate. Just like a smoker who thinks ciggies taste good until they stop (I know this one too).  Anyway I used to eat white bread and then I started eating healthy.  Now white bread tastes nasty, like paste.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	Yes, it's healthier. Many recipes call for replacing only half of the white flour with wheat flour.    I've learned to like whole wheat flour in place of white. It takes 6 or 7 tries to really "get" the taste of it, but it's good once you give it a chance.|`|TB12kOefaa	It's a healthier choice. Wheat has a lot of important nutrients that you just can't get from White flour. White flour is very processed.    I'm guilty as hell though. I prefer white flour.

As for the brand you should wear, why not try a variety before you settle on the brand that gives you the best support and comfort.

8OqdoIHtaa	I doubt that he's had it all his life. That means he would be type 1 and on insulin since being a baby.     He's just starting insulin now, which means he's type 2.     He WAS making insulin but now can't make enough and has to inject it.     Type 2 is generally the type of diabetes you get in adult life, usually after age 40. Some kids are now getting it, but its not very common.     If you and your Dad want to know more about diabetes, why not read the book "Diabetes for Dummies" together. That way he could learn about insulin and you could learn about diabetes.     Its a good thing you are showing an interest and are willing to learn.     He'll need encouragement and support in this new stage of the disease. Many people view needing insulin as a failure on their part. Its not. It just means that your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin for your body's needs. In any case, it can be a depressing thing for any type 2 diabetic. Give him lots of love and encouragement.     There is also a book by Gretchen Becker that I have listed on my blog, and I recommend it as well as the other one.     http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-NbDgUzQhf...    Good luck!|`|1UdSxaCZaa	some diabetics can use diet to regulate their blood sugar. if hes now taking insulin it probably means his diet alone can no longer regulate his blood sugar, as he is getting older.   Hope this helps|`|Rmx39jjxaa	"Many people with diabetes take insulin to control their blood sugar (glucose)."    I provided a link in the source where you can learn more about what insulin is.    Also, I think that it's great you want to stay informed! That shows much maturity.|`|wa7Ye5a9aa	He didn't have to take insulin because his pancreas was producing insulin enough; he was probably only taking pills to "stimulate" his pancreas to make more insulin.  One reason to start taking insulin would be that he has gained weight.  There are several reasons why a non-insulin dependent diabetic has to start taking insulin, including but not limited to: medication induced hyperglycemia, not taking diabetes pills correctly, any stress to the body such as colds or flu.  He may have eaten before his blood test instead of fasting, which can give a doctor a false reading.  There are many factors that can contribute to him being on insulin now.   Best of luck to him.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	His body doesn't produce insulin, so he must take it to process the sugar in his body he gets from eating.
GrnIjiMiaa	For the pain, I would recommend alternating Tylenol and Ibuprofen (so that you can take something every 2 hrs). This usually works to keep the pain away. Schedule an appointment with your dentist. That way he can take x-rays and see if it is one of your teeth. If so - he'll be able to fix the problem.    I would think that cold numb the area and hopefully alleviate some of that pain for you    Good Luck|`|m5hmJMKZaa	i would use heat instead of ice, it sounds like ur tooth, i'd also take a pain reliever
MOcsfKyMaa	Just because your married, doesn't mean he knows all your ins and outs. You have to communicate. LOTS AND LOTS OF COMMUNICATION.   Sex is gonna be such an important tool in your marriage.   You will need to connect with your husband on a different level. You should be able to express yourself through sex. And sometimes, just skip the arguing and have a good sex session to relieve the stress.     Come clean. Tell him that exactly what you told us. Its sincere.     Also, you have to understand, he too will not have all the magic answers. If you two have just started sex, you need to basically get to know each other all over again.     The first few times will hurt a little, but its not all about the physical act. This is your husband we're talking about. I'm sure he cares about  you and after you two talk about it, he will treat you with care. Then you can take it slow. Even if it hurts, look into his eyes. Soon you'll think about how much you love him that it might distract you from what is physcially hurting you. It will relax you. That might be a big factor. Being able to relax will set you free.     I know i'm just a stranger, but I promise you...sex is your friend. You are spending the rest of your life with this man. Learn as much as you can about what you like, don't like. Sex will be great if you give it a chance.   I hate to say this because i don't want to discourage you but i think its necessary you hear it:    If you can't have pleasurable sex with your husband, it will not work.     =(    I'm sorry. I really am rooting for your success. Please just keep trying. Keep an open mind and communicate a lot.|`|kAblN2YTaa	try using toys and lube you might just not be that wet or into it and start off with the easy stuff like hand jobs and stuff like that|`|CS3W706xaa	i dont think the penis is going in right its kinda like a tampon it needs to go in right or els it will hert try taking a sex class with your husband|`|v7W8yBP7aa	the first few times it is really going to hurt and you wont like it no one does, after that you will love it trust me if the oain does not go away see your doctor but i had the same problem. hope this helps! good luck =)|`|2QrD904Gaa	I'm sorry. That sucks :(  I would just suggest trying new things.. different positions too. Make sure you are very aroused before he enters you. If you aren't aroused, it will hurt! Just let it happen naturally and don't think about it too much or plan it. That makes it more stressful and you won't enjoy it. Maybe light some candles and give each other a massage first. Just have fun and explore each others bodies and relax :)|`|lsHsXXtuaa	What you need to do is keep doing it. It's not going to feel good at first. Once it stops hurting and he fits in better it will start to feel good.|`|Q6ig8k7Xaa	What do you mean when you say you don't like it?    Is it painful, uncomfortable, or are you unable to become aroused?    Sex is not just penetration, try different things until you find something you like.    Do you masturbate? If you do think about what you like there and tell your husband to do those things.    If you don't, it is something you should do, just to get more in touch with your body, and understand yourself better.    You should be seeing a gynecologist regularly, if you aren't you should start and they will rule out any physical problems.|`|BfhGumxYaa	use lubricants|`|fLdEOmPVaa	It is not totally uncommon to not like sex.  Some women are just not that easily aroused and there are actually drugs to help you out with a low libido, if that is truly the case:    http://www.boostwomenslibido.com/?ucroi_...      There's nothing wrong with you. But perhaps you should try looking into libido enhancing products and techniques and see if they work? It's better than a sexless marriage, which would be torture for your husband.|`|JqvSEBIqaa	Oh my gosh, why did you get married?  If your husband is the type that needs the attention and requires it to be happy, you will have a very unhappy marriage in the future if your attitude doesn't change about your marital duties.  I wished I had married someone like your husband when I married my first husband and he only liked sex about 3 times a year and I was 19 and he was 20.  I stayed married to him for 24 years and I nearly went crazy for the lack of SEX.  The last five years we didn't have any sex at all.  Finally I filed for divorce, three kids later.  Get some professional help or you are going to loose that good man whom you think so much of and is putting up with it right now because he loves you very much.  Maybe one day he will not feel the same way!!!!!!!!!!!

Now the best way to treat is by heat ,massage antiinflamatory  drugs such as aleve or advil ..and a rubbing ointment .    Try soaking in hot baths , for an hour each night ..just sit and soak do this for a  week ...use a heating pad if you have one     If you get someone to do this for you take youre shirt off and have them use lotion or massage oil and very gently using the tips of their fingers and their palms massage youre back as if they were kneeding dough ..    Also get some icy hot or other menthol based rub and have someone rub it into youre back ..it will help i promise .

You may have pulled a ligament.    Squats should not affect your shoulders, unless you had weights across them.  In that case, yes, you could have torn a ligament or muscle.    I would not rely on a website to give you medical answers; unless it is advising you to see your local doctor.  The last thing you need is a back injury that will never go away... Trust me.|`|pJ3TNB6uaa	me too, my back always hurts... take some aspirin.. maybe see a doctor|`|ahci6qGUaa	oxycodone 10 minutes|`|mxOPLCBzaa	take some medicine or something like nurofen (if they have that in america) and then take some panadol in like 2 hours ( if they have panadol in america)

Damn thats short....no offense    But since your so short being 77 lbs is a completely healthy weight!  According to this website-  http://kidshealth.org/teen/food_fitness/...    Its funny how people are telling you, you need to eat. When someone hears a low number when it comes to someones weight they always assume your underweight. You have to look at how tall the person is! Some people are just ignorant.
0683ccd6412eda6bd75ac2f24a0c357aaa	Run....lots and lots of cardio.    Crunches, sit-ups and other ab exercises will help, but to tone abs, you need to burn the fat layer around them, that requires cardio of at least 30 minutes per session, twice a day.    Also, look into Yoga. It is great for core strengthening and toning.

UZxeBrxQaa	Yes, Malaria needs a vaccine badly, but none has been developed for this parasite.  Its not a bacteria or virus, so a vaccine is going to be a real problem to develop antibodies to a living creature.

Either it was something you ate or chemical related. Think if you've used something new, such as soap, detergent, aftershave, shampoo, or a new shirt. New clothes that haven't been washed often have traces of leftover chemicals like formaldehyde that people are allergic to. Otherwise, you may be allergic to a medication. Think back a few weeks ago and try to remember if you took any pills. Sometimes, you can even suddenly become allergic to a medication you were okay with before. Keep looking for an answer! It looks painful!

6LtmIxhCaa	I would say 3-4 weeks. Stick to your diet. The diet is the most important part. Work out hard and it will all pay off. Abs are another story. Everyone has a different body make up, metabolism, genetics, etc..    Some people have abs and they eat mcdonalds some peopel eat healthy and have no abs. If you can naturally see any abs then they will come very quick. If not then it will take more work. Time is the only answer to reaching your goal. Stay on your routine and you will have what you want in no time.    www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartevermad...

In fact, if you are working out the way you claim, you really need to increase your caloric intake or you will find you are burning off more muscle than fat. From there, your menstrual cycle will be off and before you know it, you're fainting somewhere in between classes. Why not find a trainer and have that person help you determine the best workout routine that fits your body type and goals, and diet. Plus, healthy results take about 30 days, but it's so worth the wait. Three kids, and I wear a size 6, and can still fit my wedding dress, but I work out 4 times a week for 45 minutes. I eat healthy, and I rely on my trainer to advise me. If you can't afford a trainer, try a website on the subject, the public library, or your doctor for advice.

AA11301302	It's normal to feel sorry for yourself when you're upset. Feeling sorry for yourself is the substitute when you feel like no one will have compassion for you.     It doesn't matter if other peoples' problems are "worse." There's really no point in comparing - God cares about everyone individually and has mercy and compassion on you regardless of whether you think your issues are trivial. Just remember that God loves you and He has real compassion on you and will never leave you. Try to turn to Him if you feel you can. I know what it's like to feel depressed, and God has helped me out of it more times than I can count.    Take care and hang in there.|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	Well I think you're on the right track you realize that you life could be worse. A lot of teens go through a stage like you. If you're really bothered by your behavior then why don't you try to do something good for someone else. Doesn't have to be anything big just something small like offer to help an elderly neighbor or volunteer at a animal shelter. Something you can look at and say wow I'm a really good person. Sometimes teens and kids have that attitude because people they care about don't give them enough credit for a job well done.|`|eua5YYYcaa	Listen, the teenage ears are very hard.  All the changes you go thru be they emotional, physical,  or friends.  Being a teenager can suck!      You also have had a tragedy today which I assume was expected and that is a load to bear.  please take solace on the fact that you aren't one of the teenage brats where I love that all have blackberry touched and get their own card....not a good way to grow up.    I do think you should volunteer in anything you like it will make you feel great about yourself!  So many people need your help    Maybe you should ask your parents to go to a therapist.  He or she can just listen to you wit out judgement.
dcWN4v6Jaa	I'd say two weeks but, if you take Advil right after your appointment I guarantee you that you will be fine for the rest of the weeks. I had braces for 6 months now I just need them for another 2 years. Here is some information about braces.      WEBSITES  1. http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...  2. http://www.bracesinfo.com/  3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...  4. http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...  5. http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...     PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.     DON"T'S  1, Don't eat hard foods.  2. Don't chew gum.  3. Don't stress over it.     FOODS YOU CANNOT EAT  1. popcorn  2. gum  3. carmel  4. apple (whole)  5. Ice  6.nuts  7. peanut brittle  8.hard pizza crust  9. corn on cob  10. ribs  11. chips  12. hard pretzels  13. hard rolls and bagels  14. raw carrots  15. beef jerky  16. corn nuts   17. suckers                           No, they do not give you a shot. It is pain free when they do it.|`|PvO4Ku8uaa	Well the first day I had them my teeth hurt really bad that whole day and I couldn't really eat anything.. On the second and third day all I ate was really soft foods and by day four I was back to normal and my braces weren't bothering me! I didn't mind my braces for the first year but after that I couldn't wait to get them off. Good luck|`|J5xp6H8maa	personnally it hurt the hole time i had braces but i dont no my friend said it only hurt for 2 years|`|pQASzF35aa	I just got my braces 2 days ago. And i took painkillers about 30 minutes before i went and it doesn't hurt. it only hurts when i chew on things.|`|1nINGDC7aa	The fixing of braces does not hurt itself. There is wire in the brackets which puts pressure on the teeth to move and this movement hurts. For the first time, you can have pain in your teeth for upto 10 days. Afterwards you get used to it and also the pain subsides. However the discomfort remains and the dentist will adjust the wire in every followup visit to adjust the pressure. For more on braces you can visit the following very informative dental website... http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|7basZRQ7aa	At first it's just really tight on your teeth, no pain.  After the first night, it's uncomfortable and gets worse for like a day.  It never really hurts, but it isn't a walk in the park.  The 'pain' does NOT last for weeks, only a couple days.    Then after the initial insertion, when you get your new bands on, it's pretty much two days of discomfort.    Braces aren't bad, only problem is getting food stuck in them, I suggest carrying a toothbrush in your backpack and avoiding things like corn on the cob or crunching ice.|`|emrBZuaxaa	okay, it depends on who you are to know how much it will hurt because if you are a real wuss than they will hurt for two weeks.  But there is something you can do to make your braces not hurt as much... Eat pasta (pasta is soft on your teeth), eat ice cream (numbs the pain), try not to bite down hard(feels like needles are sticking into your gums), drink lots of liquids.  When you get your braces on they will cut your cheeks no doubt so put wax on the brackets that are hurting you. Your orthodontist will tell you where the brackets are.  The pain also depends on which kind of braces you are getting, I had the new kind called Damon. They do not hurt as much.

AARZV2v0aa	i think you dont want to get happy again because you dont want to be at a good place just to lose it again. You think that happiness is temporary, so why get it if its just going to go away. I think if you can look past that you will see that happiness can last for as long as you(the person) desides. Try to stay busy that always helps. Call up friends, go out on a date, hang out with family. If you dont have friends or a girl, im sorry... but go out and meet knew people its more fun than you would think. Try new things. Exercise or do another hobby. I say exercise because it produces endorphins and those make you happy. I hope i helped! just hang in there everything always gets better! =)|`|yYgsyopAaa	Are you on medication? If not, dang dude, it sure sounds like you need to be. Depression sucks ~ I know. But it can be managed with the right drugs. Borderline sucks ~ I know that, too.

Drugs such as Effexor, Wellbutrin, Lexapro, Cymbalta, Lithium, etc. can help you live life again. If your doc doesn't see the need, then go to a different, more intelligent doc. Just don't give up and don't give in to the thoughts that invade your mind.|`|EjdOItfEaa	I do when ever I get depressed I can't think of one thing that makes me happy really and when I come up with something that makes me happy, something bad comes to mid that ruins the good thing in some way makes it a unhappy though.

0d7f887fb3ac247270ead8e6149f352eaa	Yes it can. however there is something you can do to level it off. start by reading labels on the foods you by. limit your intake of sugars and then try eating alot of protien. It's not always the sugar that causes weight gain, but the fat in the food. you can also drink green tea. It has properties in it that helps regulate weight gain|`|AG9msdUDaa	I gained weight from birth control.

K0jBt9umaa	there isn't much you can do except if he has one except try your best to keep him from hitting his head on something hard. maybe put pillows under his head and around him to help that. also turn him on his side but thats about all you can do except just wait till its over. also do your best to make sure he remembers to take his medicine. if he takes his medicine he most likely won't have one.|`|3jCNZmv3aa	First, don't panic; remain calm. Do not try to hold him down or put anything in his mouth. It is impossible to swallow your tongue so don't worry. Stay with him and make sure that he doesn't hurt himself. Move things out of his way and watch that he does not hit his head. He will probably sleep afterwards as seizures are taxing on the body, just make sure he is comfortable.   You sound like a caring girlfriend. He is lucky to have you.|`|rrp9c2tnaa	The advice above is all good.  Talk to him about it.  Also, if you are in contact with his mom/parents at all, ask her/them.  A parent (good one, anyway) will have learned and planned for every possible contingency and will be able to teach you everything.      Seizure victims are not always aware that they are having one.  A close loved one will know his "signs" and clues to look for.  A petit mal seizure can mean he just "spaces out" for a minute.  If at all possible, you need to learn what has happened during his prior seizures so you can recognize even the smallest ones.  A person whose medication is beginning to lose efficacy often begins having very mild seizures before suffering a gran mal seizure.  It would help if you can know the signs that his medication needs to be adjusted before he gets to the serious stage.|`|vwDsYFIxaa	911?|`|MYilJDb5aa	Put him on his side, and moniter it. If it lasts longer than a minute, get help and an ambulance, pronto.|`|ucr4J8kcaa	Just be honest with him that it worries you.    Make sure you cushion his head so he doesn't hit it. Move any breakable/harmful objects away. Many websites say do not restrain the person having the seizure, meaning don't hold them down or anything. You should probably call 911 as well.|`|dsu0mvOOaa	Actually I had tis xperience often . There nothing much to do . Just make sure what are the symptoms & inform neurology . Ensure he doesnt do any silly things. Take note whether it happen in the day or night . If he bite his teeth , turn  his head side way or insert a handkechef into his mouth. After all this commotion is over , try to wake him up . Dont ask silly question cos he may not remember wat had happened at that few minutes ago . Let meknow if u want more details.

Educate yourself on seizures.  There are many sites to learn from.  My son has them and it can be scary depending on the type of seizure.  If it's a convulsion, you should lay the person on their side and just let them go and don't call out to them.  The idea is not to stimulate the brain any more at that time.  Try to be sure that the person doesn't get hurt.  Understanding what is going on is the key.  Most people come out of seizures okay, but are very tired and sore.|`|K1gTGKWKaa	clear some space to prevent him from hitting things and hurting himself place his head on a towel or on something to help cushion his head and wait it out   DON'T stick anything in his mouth an old wives tail said they may swallow their tounge that is false|`|cLg083OEaa	the best thing u should do is call 911 and put a spoon on his tongue so he wont swallow his tongue.|`|YJkT10aUaa	Ask him but I doubt its different from any other seizure.

But I'd say for one make sure nothing is around him that can hurt him (coffee table etc.) maybe throw some pillows around him, phone emergency, then go and try to keep him in one place, but dont hold him down hard. Try keep your hand under his head so he doesnt hurt it. (If you can put something soft in his mouth, do that to protect his teeth, and does he carry an epi pen?)|`|H21Un2fiaa	Dont let his head hit anything! hold him, and if it gets to bad call 911.  :) but hopefully you will never have to hehe.

This is only90calories per cup and will give you your vitamin D and vitamin B12, which is only available in animal products and is poorly absorbed in vitamins.  Milk will stabilize your blood sugars and decrease hunger and is an excellent diet or diabetic choice and it will keep your bones strong too.  The mixing of beans with grains or nuts completes the proteins chains and will give you ample protein.  Your diet should consist of 3 protein choices a day at least and a protein choice would be an item with 7 gms of protein/ you can find out how much protein is in something by reading the labels.  If you do this, you will have 48 gm of protein a day minimum.  If you do not like the skim milk you could add berries and sweetener to it to make a very berry milk drink that tastes quite nice.  You can also use skim milk powder and add it to your soups or other foods.|`|GzlckRcnaa	soy milk n nuts are good source of protein..|`|FCRX9MJMaa	Nuts.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	tofu|`|VkvJJUtxaa	vitamin pills|`|HnDOdAksaa	Eat shampoo, its a great source of proten|`|zI6cZoAWaa	eat meat|`|gB9jEUjmaa	spinich i think :)|`|V9uMoELzaa	Eat nuts or get some fruit smoothies!

You should learn more about protein to begin with. Why humans become so big (gain muscle, fat, etc) on animal protein is because our body doesn't need to break down to protein chain as much. The fastest way to absorb protein into our body is to eat human flesh. Disgusting and not going to happen, I hope. Simple protein (meat) your body can use quicker. Complex protein (plant) your body must break own and rearrange the chain a lot more in order for us to use it. That's why you need more plant protein than animal.  Someone already mentioned tofu. Also you could go to a health food store and buy soy protein mixes, but you shouldn't need to.  I've just became a vegetarian myself for health reasons. I absolutely hate dairy products and try to use them as least as I possibly can. I found that soy (silk) milk can be used as a substitute in just about all of your cooking. Plus the taste is great. It is a little watery but you will be overlooking that within your second glass.|`|Ha5EZoJ6aa	peanut butter, peanuts, see weed, and things with nuts in them

Then he told me, that it was perfectly normal for men to experience pain in that area. He gave me NO specific reasons why, but told me that LOTS of males experience it. So I should think that YOU don't have too much, to worry about. And since then, I haven't experienced it too much more, recently.

Each monthly cycle brings about hormonal changes, including increases in estrogen and progesterone, that bring more fluid into the breasts, expanding tissue, stretching nerve fibers, and producing pain. Some women experience this painful swelling just before their periods, with symptoms subsiding near the end of the menstrual flow. Others experience it as a side effect of birth-control pills. To prevent and lessen the discomfort of breast swelling, a change in diet and nutrition may help. The discoloration can most likely be explained by the fact that when  your breast or nipples are swollen in pain infected or any number of things your nipples go virtually color blind. In this case it is most likely a side-effect of the swelling.|`|7o27vGPvaa	Post pictures so I can evaluate them more thoroughly.|`|5ed1y0uuaa	Maybe your hormones are going crazy, ovulation, or pregnant?

A9j7ahwsaa	don't eat after 6.30pm, don't try to go to bed until u are sleepy, reading a few pages of a book are a good way to get tired. try some deep breathing as you are trying to fall asleep. there is a natural sedative called valerian, start with the largest dose and take every night for a least a month. when u wake up too early, try the deep breathing thing but stay in bed. if your mind is full of stuff get up and write it down before trying to sleep. waking is a habit u r body gets used to u need to break the cycle. good luck|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	Do you have any other weird symptoms like Excessive daytime sleepiness or when you have these nightmares does it almost seem like they are real, meaning it seems like other senses are involved.Example if you dream you are being choked its almost feels as though it was really happening.|`|oUEjtZyEaa	smoke marijuana its the best natural sleep aid you can find.|`|Iz2qSO8Kaa	try using a dream catcher. do they work? of course not! but knowing its there and eally trying to believe it works might subconsciousy make the bad dreams go away. im no therapist, but i say give it a try.

You need to see a doctor, and if it is B.V., you need to be prescribed antibiotics. It won't go away on it's own.    Normal discharge should NOT smell fishy. Normal discharge smells a little sweet, and a little like your armpits.     It's nothing to be ashamed of, since it doesn't mean you're a skank or anything. Just tell your mom to set up a doctor's appt. for you. You might even be able to go to a "regular" doctor, instead of a gyno, which I know can be scary for someone so young.|`|qXkPtOVWaa	what you are experiencing is completely normal so there is nothing to worry about. as far the "fishy' smell, try eating healthier foods.|`|VCIZJQCJaa	you are perfectly normal. it's just nature's way of cleansing you.|`|BJzhuAGWaa	trust me. youre fine. it happens to everyone, some people just have more. same thing for me too.. haha.|`|MW5EJxKNaa	Don't worry about it.  The discharge is normal; it exists to clean out your vagina and keep you healthy.  If you aren't in any pain, and it is white and milky, that is completely normal.  Yes, it is a little annoying, but you get used to it.

3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	800mg of ibuprofen won't kill you. It is very hard on your stomach, so make sure you take it with food.    It's not a good idea to take ibuprofen on a long term basis. You should be taking it only when you really need it. If you are in that much pain every night, you should talk to your doctor about trying to find and treat the underlying cause of the pain. It's quite possible that you have developed a dependency on ibuprofen, which means that you get pain anytime you stop taking it. In that case, it would be best to slowly wean yourself off of it.|`|w8hgR6Bfaa	id say that's too much medicine to be taking every day. try to cut down to half that. do it gradually though...     also make sure you eat before you take those.|`|8airt9MLaa	In general, its not good to take a lot of medicine because when you really need it, it wont work as well. i would say talk to your doctor or something about finding a medicine good for you|`|AA11707529	Whoa.... that is WAY too much! And yes, too much of Advil can cause kidney or liver damage.. i know, because my cancer doctor told me that. i'm on chemo, so i listen to him about every little painkiller side effect. Stop the ibprofren, cut back to 500mg, Take AdvilPM right before bedtime, and only just ONE. And drink tons of water to avoid kidney/liver damage. On days when you're not all achy, don't take any at all, just to be safe. AdvilPM works real fast, so be ready to get in bed when you take it.|`|VDXsfMLWaa	this is very bad for your stomach, it can cause a stomach ulcer which would produce a lot of pain. I would cut back and make sure that if you do take it, you take if with food. Talk to your doctor, he should be able to prescribe something a little easier on the stomach.
vHwYENVjaa	I take a medication that is an anti convulsant ... basically when used for psychological reasons, it is for people who are MOSTLY BIPOLAR. SOMETIMES they are used for people with treatment resistant depression.    I take lamictal, for example. They haven't determined whether I have bipolar, but if I do it would be type II. They think if it is not bipolar, which I do not think it is, it is treatment resistant depression.    Basically, these meds are mood stabilizers... they help people feel more in the middle instead of feeling too high and happy and risky or too low and suicidal.    I don't know if many people do not like taking their medication. I don't know of many people who LIKE to take pills.. no one really wants to have to be on medication, but people who want to get better realize they need to at least give it a try.     Sometimes people will not take these medications because of the side effects such as hairloss or weight gain, liver toxicity, etc.    I take lamictal, which has given me no side effects and frequently does not give any side effects.    I suppose these medications would help people who have anger issues or have problems controlling their moods... since it helps stabilize your mood more.    I don't think it makes the person THINK differently, only you can change your thinking, and only therapy can help that. Medications like this can only help you CONTROL your moods better, help you from going too low and crying all the time and feeling suicidal.. etc|`|4iGEJNvkaa	Anticonvulsants and other medications too..      Common anticonvulsants prescribed are:  Lamictal(lamotrigine)  Neurontin( gabapentin)  Depakote( valproic acid and its derivatives)  Trileptal( oxcarbazepine)  Tegretol( carbamazepine)    Antipsychotics  Geodon( ziprasidone  Seroquel( quetiapine)  Abilify( aripriprazole)  Zyprexa( olanzapine)  Risperdal( risperidone)    Anixety medications like: Xanax(alprazolam), Ativan( lorazepam), Valium( diazepam), Klonopin( clonazepam), Buspar( buspirone)    These medications help people's symptoms really improve and helps them be able to function....  They are good medications....    I am a pharmacy tech student|`|HtRLnntRaa	Why do you want to know, the doc will prescribe them if you need them.    There is no legal consequences if they don't take them, but it they become a danger to themselves or others they can be sectioned (UK).    The medication works by altering the brains chemistry, most mental health issues are caused by a chemical imbalance.    My mum says they make her feel sick thats the reason she don't like taking them.    Her main ones that i know are diazepam (vallium), and lithium, then every now and again the doc will prescibe and extra one if needed (chlopromazine - somthing like that).

Y08YLysXaa	I have the same problem, it's probably candida/yeast infection. It can also be worsened if your mouth & gums are dry, like if you sleep with your mouth wide open at night etc. You can get a capsule to rid your body of candida (over the counter) at the chemist, and see if it helps. I brush my tongue hard with a toothbrush and lots of tooth paste, gargle, use chewing gum. It helps my breath but it comes back within hours.|`|bgDMY8I2aa	I have sinus problems that cause similar symptoms. Post nasal drip can leave an awful taste in your mouth. I find good oral hygiene and the use of oregano oil useful. I just put a couple of drops on my toothbrush. It is kind of expensive but worth it I think. It can be purchased at health food stores. Hope this helps you.
RXI8ImdIaa	Yeah you took WAY too much. Your liver is not going to shut down from just one day of this, but the immediate danger is the damage to your stomach lining.    ibuprofen is very rough on the stomach lining, and even a normal dose should be taken with food or water. If your stomach is hurting now, take some pepto bismol and/or drink some milk, whatever you can do to calm your stomach. If you have stomach pain that can't be relieved, call a doctor. If you vomit blood or a coffee-grounds looking substance, go to the emergency room.    never, never, never take that much ibuprofen at once without the express directions from a doctor.|`|AA12357988	How on earth is taking that many Advil going to make you less upset?

y2ZLVTPGaa	whether you meet the DSM-IV's criteria for bulimia or not, it is a problem.  Given that you have a pervasive history of engaging in purgingg behavior i think most doctors would diagnose you with an eating disorder.  either way, by purging as often as you do you are causing irreparable damage to youresophaguss, teeth and cardiovascular system.  throwing up is a process that traumatizes your body and was only intended by nature to purge infections orpoisonss from the body for survival purposes.  It is also not an effective weight management technique in the long run.  you need to stop and if you cannot stop on your own (wouldn'tt expect anyone with this behavior to stop successfully with no help) youshouldl get a counselor, join a support group (try eatingdisorderss anonymous, etc) and find some exercises that you enjoy and will do on a daily basis to make you feel better about yourself in a healthy way. And talk to your doctor, so they can check out your teeth, esophogas etc.|`|lc9nus8taa	yes|`|lKof1n0Xaa	I don't think you have Bulimia. Yes you do throw up in order to lose weight, but you seem to have a sensible head on your shoulders, and the frequency of which you throw up is, well, not that frequent.   I think you just need to be honest with yourself. Just stop throwing up when you're dieting, it's that simple. I don't think you have an eating disorder, because you don't seem addicted or mentally altered in any way.   You can't use Bulimia as an excuse for your behaviour. I think you know better than to do that, and you aren't giving yourself enough credit. You have it in you to stop all by yourself right now. If you want to lose weight, do it the sensible way. I believe you can.|`|x3PLREEuaa	The Duke Family -- cousins Bo ( John Schneider) and Luke (Tom Wopat), assisted by their cousin Daisy ( Catherine Bach) and their uncle, Jesse (Denver Pyle)-- fight the system and root out the corrupt practices of Hazzard County Commissioner Boss Hogg (Sorrell Booke) and his bumbling brother-in-law-Sheriff Rosco P. Coltrane (James Best). The show became an instant hit, never failing to win its time slot during its original run on CBS for seven seasons from 1979-1985. The Duke boys, a pair of 'Robin Hood' types complete with bows and Dynamite arrows, are assisted in their adventures by their car, an orange 1969 Dodge Charger named 'The General Lee'. The Dukes of Hazzard is set in Georgia, and the show's southern influence is felt throughout. Country singing superstar Waylon Jennings performed the famous theme song to the show (Good Ol' Boys), and acts as The Balladeer, narrating the adventures of each episode. Furthermore, many of the plots revolved around the Dukes' history as an ex-moon-shining family. The story followed Bo and Luke until season five, because during episodes 87 through 104, their cousins Coy (Byron Cherry)and Vance (Christopher Mayer) replaced the boys while the went on to join NASCAR Circuit. Bo and Luke won, but returned to Hazzard after great season at the NASCAR Circuit. Innocently naive Deputy Enos Strate, though technically a member of the law under Boss Hogg, strives for justice and fairness, while also having a major crush on Daisy. Ace mechanic Cooter Davenport helps the Dukes along the way, and Deputy Cletus Hogg, though not as honest as Enos, subtlety assists the Dukes escape from 'Hogg justice'.|`|k04nYH4Aaa	Take from a bulimic expert. You are definitely bulimic. I was bulimic for 7 years, only when I got pregnant did I stop for good. You will have to hit rock bottom with your health and be really scared of death before you realize how bad it is. Every time you throw up, whether it is the first time or the thousandth time, you run the risk of your stomach or esophagus rupturing and death will occur. I am only telling you this because I know. There is no size dress that you can fit into once you are dead. Think about that. Good luck to you!|`|M0dzSvHcaa	Your problem looks very serious, that's for me. I think it is better for you to eat a lot of times in one day than you a lot at once and and you throw it up. When you feel hungry eat a small amount that can satisfied your stomach, in that way you can help yourself. When you see delicious food eat a little, eat six times a day just amount. I did that before too like for 1 year, I throw up the food that I ate cuz I wanted to be sexy. But then I realized I wasn't really helping cuz right after I throw up I'm hungry, and I tried to eat 6 times a day small amount of food and it works. It really works!

464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	The idea that a single item of food has miraculous weight loss properties seems a farce. The grapefruit is a marvelous fruit - a natural simple carbohydrate high in fibre and vitamin C. But to use it as the sole foundation of a weight loss program is unwise. However recent research has discovered that the grapefruit has more to it than meets the eye.    A lot of the grapefruit diet plans that have been circulating are very low calorie diet plans (VLCDs) with a grapefruit thrown in. VLCDs are not a good weight loss solution for many people. Most versions of the Grapefruit diet are identical to the Mayo Clinic Diet.    Recently the Scripps clinic, based in San Diego carried out a clinical trial and discovered the following:    The 12-week pilot study, led by Dr. Ken Fujioka, monitored weight and metabolic factors, such as insulin secretion, of the 100 men and women who participated in the Scripps Clinic Grapefruit Diet study. On average, participants who ate half a grapefruit with each meal lost 3.6 pounds, while those who drank a serving of grapefruit juice three times a day lost 3.3 pounds. However, many patients in the study lost more than 10 pounds.. The researchers speculate that the chemical properties of grapefruit reduce insulin levels and encourage weight loss.    By all means include grapefruit in your diet - it may give you an edge. But for serious and sustained weight loss - look elsewhere.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Let's see the most scientific data just in!

RXI8ImdIaa	Well, to me, 'dealing with it' implies that you don't make an issue out of it.    It's not necessary to reach orgasm every time you have sexual intimacy. This is something that most people realize as they get older.    Also it's fairly common for men to have a harder time achieving multiple orgasms as they get older. Multiple could mean anything from more than once a day to more than once every 5 days - it depends on the man. If he doesn't seem bothered by the lack of an orgasm, then 'deal with it' - don't worry about it :)    If you just can't get over it yourself, how about if you ask him about it? He might be able to put your mind at ease.    Edit: notice I said "ask" about it - don't "confront" him with it lol... just making sure|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Could be some underlying cause in his lack or loss of stamina.  Does he smoke, drink beer or booze or do drugs?  Does he eat a lot of junk food & fast food garbarge instead of good, healthy balanced meals?  Is he stressed out at work or at home?  Try convincing him to change his eating habits.  Try getting him up one hour early every morning to take a BRISK 30 minute walk - then - do the same thing again in the eveing after dinner.  Within 90 days you both will be able to tell a noticeable difference in his overall health.

ucr4J8kcaa	Don't take steroids! I know a lot of guys who have experimented with them and you end up looking like a freak.    Lift weights, but avoid straining your leg muscles as this will increase your size. Pilates and other similar exercises will help the leg muscles become leaner. Consume a lot of protein if you want your muscles to get bigger. Basically, decrease the amount of work you're doing on your lower half and increase the work on the upper half.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	I can tell you are really stuck on yourself even at age 14.

There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn to complete development - and you are no exception.

I don't believe your doctor said that to you. If he did, he's irresponsible - but I seriously question if he did.    You will most likely continue growing in height until about 16-17 years old.

3YfYWpAsaa	)eat a lot of protein and eat 5-7 big meals a day. EAT LOTS of hot peppers- they tend to increase your metabolism and make you therefore lose weight, since less of the food turns to meat on you.    2) take a multi-vitamin in the morning w/ breakfast, take 2 calcium/vitD pills a day to keep your bones strong, drink 2 musclemilk: chocolate protein shakes a day (they taste the best, honestly...), get 9 hours of sleep a night, etc. DRINK LOTS OF WATER SO YOU ARE LESS HUNGRY NATURALLY, AND CAN WORK OUT BETTER.    3) lift weights, 3 sets of 10 of all of these bro... do this routine: (get a gym membership, and do it at a gym.)    mon, wed, fri = lower body    squats  leg press  dumbbell lunges  deadlifts  leg extension  leg curl 5 SETS  standing calf raise  sitting calf raise  knee raises on captain's chair  butt kickbacks  leg abduction  leg adduction    tues, thurs, sat= upper body    bench press  upright rows  incline bench  lat pull  overhead press  assisted pull-ups  chest flies  dips (on the U bar)  overhead pull-down  shoulder shrugs  tricep extension  bicep curl  forearm curl/reverse curl  lower back extensions  ==========================    4) Do about 20 straight minutes of circuit training, working your abs, sides, obliques, lower back, etc. If you don't wanna run, then you MUST do this 20 minutes, and do it hard! non-stop high intensity ab work, fast and hard. pick about 5-7 different ab exercises and just do them in a circuit, over and over.    5) As much as you hate running..... you are STILL going to have to do it AT LEAST once a week, if you honestly want to lose weight. I'm sorry, but veggies aren't going to cut it for you- you need carbs, you need meat, you need a balanced diet if you wanna be healthy... AND YOU NEED TO RUN!    so ONCE a week- only once- I advise you to go out and run at least a mile, if you put alot of effort into it you will get MUCH MORE out of it than if you huff and puff and run a sucky mile. you should be DEAD at the end of it.    6) start taking creatine monohydrate 189 pills.  They are natural, and the body creates it naturally..... but if you give yourself the extra (perfectly legal) boost, you will KICK MAJOR *** in your sport! Creatine gives extra water to muscles, makes you gain muscle and burn fat, and makes you stronger in general- as well as have a higher IQ! so it makes you smarter, too!    TRUST ME, it may suck major d*ck, but if you do everything I said here, you will lose 15 lbs. AND cut major inches off your waistline, AND get a much higher muscle %!     55 seconds ago - Edit - Delete   Source(s):  The All-Knowing Wrestler has spoken... you have just been enlightened.

3YfYWpAsaa	1)eat a lot of protein and eat 5-7 big meals a day. EAT LOTS of hot peppers- they tend to increase your metabolism and make you therefore lose weight, since less of the food turns to meat on you.    1B) NEVER eat a huge dinner or eat alot late in the day! OMG!  You have to eat a BIG breakfast!  That way, the breakfast gets burned off during the day, instead of sitting in your belly during sleep.... and it ALSO gives you more energy to work out! start eating a protein shake, a couple eggs, and some organic cereal for breakfast with whole milk. it will make your day go SO much better, and you will lose weight SO much easier. oh yeah- and eat 5-7 small meals a day, not just 3.    2) take a multi-vitamin in the morning w/ breakfast, take 2 calcium/vitD pills a day to keep your bones strong, drink 2 musclemilk: chocolate protein shakes a day (they taste the best, honestly...), get 9 hours of sleep a night, etc. DRINK LOTS OF WATER SO YOU ARE LESS HUNGRY NATURALLY, AND CAN WORK OUT BETTER.    3) lift weights, 3 sets of 10 of all of these bro... do this routine: (get a gym membership, and do it at a gym.)    mon, wed, fri = lower body    squats  leg press  dumbbell lunges  deadlifts  leg extension  leg curl 5 SETS  standing calf raise  sitting calf raise  knee raises on captain's chair  butt kickbacks  leg abduction  leg adduction    tues, thurs, sat= upper body    bench press  upright rows  incline bench  lat pull  overhead press  assisted pull-ups  chest flies  dips (on the U bar)  overhead pull-down  shoulder shrugs  tricep extension  bicep curl  forearm curl/reverse curl  lower back extensions  ==========================    4) Do about 20 straight minutes of circuit training, working your abs, sides, obliques, lower back, etc. If you don't wanna run, then you MUST do this 20 minutes, and do it hard! non-stop high intensity ab work, fast and hard. pick about 5-7 different ab exercises and just do them in a circuit, over and over.    5) As much as you hate running..... you are STILL going to have to do it AT LEAST once a week, if you honestly want to lose weight. I'm sorry, but veggies aren't going to cut it for you- you need carbs, you need meat, you need a balanced diet if you wanna be healthy... AND YOU NEED TO RUN!    so ONCE a week- only once- I advise you to go out and run at least a mile, if you put alot of effort into it you will get MUCH MORE out of it than if you huff and puff and run a sucky mile. you should be DEAD at the end of it.

pvYy6iTSaa	Prince - Salmonella is a type (genus) of bacteria with several disease-causing strains (species).   It can infect humans and other animal species.  The peanut butter Salmonella infection outbreak likely resulted from an infected worker and/or contaminated equipment involved in the peanut butter preparation who did NOT use adequate sanitation so that the bacteria was passed from the person's fecal contact (dirty toilet fingers not washed after defecating). The most common species causing disease in humans are dairy cattle, beef cattle, and poultry.      The bacteria can be carried for weeks or months, and also continues shedding long after . Many animals will never show signs, but will just serve as reservoirs and passive carriers of the disease.     S. typhimurium DT104, as with all Salmonella species, is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route. Humans normally acquire the disease from eating contaminated animal products or raw vegetables that have been contaminated.      Animal-animal transmission happens at the farm through contaminated food and water sources, pastureland, or contact with newly acquired animals. On the way to the slaughterhouse, stress and overcrowded conditions associated with transport increase the number of bacteria shed. Environmental conditions at the slaughterhouse can easily cause indirect transmission through contaminated equipment or people.    Since one infected person can infect many people, safety precautions must be taken at three different levels which must cooperate with each other - the farm, the slaughterhouse, and the preparation of food by the consumer/handler. The USDA contains further information on this subject.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	according to the news .... roaches, mold, and leaky roofs|`|AA11388527	During the processing.  Feces from some animal is a strong possibility. A leak in the roof, for example, caused one of the early outbreaks. How salmonella got into the water that was on the roof, no one knows for sure. Maybe birds, for instance, which accumulate around peanut butter processing plants.    The roasting of peanuts is the only step that will kill the salmonella. If contamination occurs after the roasting process, the game is over and salmonella is going to survive. Studies have shown that salmonella can survive for many months in peanut butter once it's present. Fatty foods are also more protective of salmonella, so when it gets into the acid of the stomach -- which is our first line of defense -- it may not get destroyed.  Peanut butter, being a highly fatty food, could survive better.|`|Mm2yIwGgaa	ive never heard of this. salmonella usually gets into things like eggs and other animal products.|`|4RpUP4teaa	Peanuts are grown on a farm.  Animal waste leaks into the water that the peanuts utilize.  The animals were infected with salmonella which remains in their waste.  As gross as it sounds, the peanuts get contaminated with the infected animal feces, which is then turned into peanut butter.|`|4BoteYDwaa	Sci Guy is right.|`|9HtzDDLOaa	The SCI guy stole my answer lol . I believe  since peanuts are grown and grow under ground  some how the  germ got into the soil. Maybe a worker or an animal  some how their feces got into the soil.  The out break we had with the peanut butter could have also come from where it was manufactured. Someone had to have put the germ in a batch of the peanut Butter.
AA11375099	we all have cancer cells already in our bodies.  (if what I read was true), so, it is not a matter of getting cancer from everything, but a matter of what triggers cancer to grow in the body that matters.    If scientists can prevent the trigger before it is pulled, then survival will be maximized.      That book I read was written by a doctor that had cancer, research was what he was doing in trying to gain information about his cancer.  And that is what he came up with.  That we all have cancer cells in us.  It is kind of profound thinking, like," we are all spirits in the physical world"|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Yes ! everything gives you cancer .Do you know what will happen if we drink 100% pure water that is 100% H2O  ?That shows nothing is safe.Everything gives you cancer if you use it in wrong way!!Nothing will give you cancer ,if you use it in proper way!!!That is why many do not get cancer ,they accidentally follow health rules!!!If you eat fibres it savesfrom bowel cancer.similarly every thing saves us from cancer!Do not fear cancer.Read health books and follow.Everything gives cancer but not for every one,for few persons!!!(For those who do not follow health rules)I think ,those who ask question about cancer in internet will not get cancer in future,because of awareness|`|er8hefmSaa	dark chocolate helps prevent cancer!|`|udPENhCxaa	In my opinion, the only thing that gives you cancer is what man has "screwed" with.

Some of the symptoms with fibromyalgia include muscle spasms. I can't quite say how to stop it, and I don't know why it's getting worse. As you may know, there is no official cure for fibromyalgia, but there are several ways to treat the symptoms. By taking perscription medicine, or by exercising, could help you with your twitching and flinching.|`|MW5EJxKNaa	If you have fibromyalgia, it sounds like this could happen.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgi...|`|AA11404502	Maybe you have PLMD - Periodic Limb Movement Disorder which is related to Restless Leg Syndrome and would be harmless except for maybe keeping you from getting to sleep. From what I understand, it mostly happens when you are relaxing &/or drifting off to sleep and also while you are trying to sleep.    You should go to your doctor and get checked anyway, especially since you said it is getting worse. You'll just stress yourself out until you do and that might be making it worse. Good luck!
tBF9VfPqaa	The best would be to get a second opinion from another doctor on your dads plan. (Get a providers list and ask around with family and friends and see if there is anyone else they recommend that is on that list).    About changing plans. All insurance companies differ by employer. You can always get a print out of coverage from your HR director as to estimated premiums and coverage. You can compare that to what your dad's insurance company covers.     Insurance companies can be a pain in the butt sometimes, but I would at least start with a second opinion form another doctor. You are right, there are a lot of them that are in it for money because of the economy and all.... so just be careful. Many dentists will provide a free consultation as well, you just have to call around. Go with your gut instinct though! Usually it will be right... (like if the office is kept up nice, or all the employees are just hanging out and goofing off....) Just be careful!     Good luck to you!!!|`|AA12106938	Absolutely get a second opinion with a different dentist. Also ask the dentist to submit a pre-treatment estimate to SafeGuard - along with your x-rays.  You should do that for any dental treatment estimated to be over $200, it will give you an idea upfront what your out-of-pocket will be and what may / may not be covered by your insurance plan.     As for switching, be cautious of pre-existing condition clauses.  This should not be an issue since you have current coverage, but be sure to have your Human Resources Benefit rep ask the broker - and get it in writing from the broker (they are an extension of the insurance company)!  Also make sure that your dentist is a preferred provider with MetLife.  That will make a difference on your-out-of-pocket.  Use this link and go to the bottom to the Dental Center to search by zip code.  http://www.metlife.com/individual/index....    Another thing to keep in mind is that SafeGuard DHMO is now a part of the MetLife family.  Although the benefits should not have changed at this time, they may in the future.      Good luck.
HvyE4qpYaa	If you've been given an estimation, NORMALLY, you just go to the dentist, pay your deductible (Usually $50 under most insurance plans if it's a type 2 or 3 procedure) and have the dental office file the claim for you.  ONce they file it, the dental office, not the insurance company, will bill you for whatever they didn't get paid.     Some dental offices require that you pay a certain percentage of the procedure.  Some will ask you to file claims... but any dentist worth his money will have his office do it for you.|`|UOZP4Ma5aa	The claim will be filed by the dr, if not, they will inform you if you have to send it in, but only if you are paying upfront first.
C3DSUacAaa	If you are not circumcised, the glans (head) and the underside of the foreskin are mucous membranes, very much like the inside of your lip. They are meant to stay moist for lubrication.    If you are circumcised or not, it might be a little lubricating fluid (pre-***) from being temporarily aroused, or perhaps leftover urine from the last time you visited the washroom. Make sure you squeeze the last drops out!|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Don't worry about it.

The source said the Raiders informed the other candidate Wednesday of their decision to go with Cable. A second source with knowledge of the Raiders' operation also told Smith the Raiders have settled on Cable as their head coach.    ESPN reached Raiders senior executive John Herrera, who denied that the club had decided on Cable as its coach.    "The decision has not been made," Herrera said. "That's not correct. At some point here we will have a head coach, but as of now that decision has not been made. We are assembling a staff as you know, but a decision on the head man has not been made."    Cable served as interim head coach in 2008 after the in-season firing of Lane Kiffin. Cable has been considered the front-runner ever since he helped the Raiders finish the season with consecutive victories while winning three of their last six games.    Still unclear are the status of contract negotiations with Cable and when the Raiders' decision will be announced.    In other news, the Raiders added two more assistant coaches to their staff, making Paul Hackett their quarterbacks coach and hiring Dwaine Board to mentor the defensive line.    Hackett, a 40-year coaching veteran, assisted the Raiders' coaching staff with special projects last season. The former head coach at USC and offensive coordinator with the Jets and Kansas City will be in charge of JaMarcus Russell's development in Oakland.    Board was the Seattle Seahawks' defensive line coach from 2003-08. He also spent 23 years in the Bay Area with the San Francisco 49ers as a player and assistant coach.|`|sxKjYyXsaa	It generally ranges from 3-7 days, but occasionally, it goes out of the range.

You're a teenager,  is this normal for you- I mean, have your other ones been longer, heavier, etc? Have you been in for a pap?  Are you on any birthcontrol? These can change your cycle. Sometimes stress can change your cycle. In the first few years, it can vary alot before it setles into a regular cycle...if you're lucky enough to have the light ones...Yay for you!

AA11301302	It does sound like depression. I wouldn't say it is necessarily "clinical" but changes in eating habits and sleeping habits are the classic signs of depression.     There is definitely light at the end of the tunnel. I can't tell you what to do, but for me, medication was not the answer. It can change your brain chemistry in permanent ways and sometimes make you feel worse. For me, the only thing that helped me with my depression was my relationship with God and Jesus Christ. I know it may not be what you want to hear, but if you don't know the Lord, ask Him into your heart and start reading the bible, especially the book of John and the Psalms.    God is in control of your life and if you have depression, He wants to help you and cares about you. Many people suffer from depression so don't worry because you aren't alone. Turn to God and to people who care about you and try to talk about your feelings. Remember you are very important to the many people in your life who love you, so don't lose hope and yes, there is ALWAYS light at the end of the tunnel. Take care.|`|RvaIQ1X6aa	I am 16, and I have felt this way for the past 4 years.

There are some medication to help this such as celexa and lexapro and the like.     What I would suggest though is that when you start feeling pressured or embarressed just breathe and relax.
CHiEKZrLaa	Ringworm is a fungal infection (no actual worms involved.)  The medical name is Tinea corporis...    It'll show up as a rash - quite red, sometimes flaky, generally itchy.  If your friend had the rash when HE used the towel and the towel wasn't washed before you used it, it's possible that you picked up the fungus.    The symptoms usually show up within a few days if you've picked up the infection.  Keep the area clean and dry (can use unscented baby powder to keep it dry, but do NOT use cornstarch.  That'll feed the fungus.)  Applying tea tree oil topically is usually pretty effective to clear it up.  If it's in a sensitive area, rinsing with a strong tea made from lavendar and/or licorice root can be effective, too.    If you try self-treating and it doesnt go away within a few weeks, get it checked by a doc and pick up a medicated cream.    Good luck!|`|coLCsrJdaa	Ring worm is a fungus- not really a worm, it appears as a roundish sore sometimes the skin inside the 'ring' is fine. It is spread thru skin to skin contact or sharing towels, linens etc.  If you get it you can use a cream on it for a week or 2, wash hands after touching it and keep it covered so you don't spread it to anyone else|`|88GkTaKMaa	it is a fungus and it starts out like a dry patch.  after a few days maybe weeks it will get bigger and you will start to notice a ring shape of dry flaky skin that itches and get very irritated easily when in the shower or from lotions.  you can treat it with different types of fungus creams the same kind you treat athletes foot with.  or you can use blue star ointment that works too.      i had ring worm twice.  not sure how i got the first one but it did spread because it got into my nervous system because it was on the back of my neck and real big the doc had to give me pills to kill it from the inside out as well as topical ointment.  the second time i was raking leaves with my then husband and he dumped a whole bunch of dead dirty leaves down my shirt and thats how i got it....i went to the same doc and got the same kind of stuff.    most likely you wont get it hopefully.

If you could get to sleep fine after working out late, then thats fine... but 90% of people have a little trouble sleeping after a late workout.    and if you could do the exact same weight in the morning, when you're stiff, cold, and famished, as you do in the middle of the day, when you're warmed up, loose, hydrated, and have energy from food... go ahead! (but 100% of people dont)    the myth is that working out in the morning wakes you up.    it does- in the short run. but in the LONG RUN, there isn't as much improvement in strength, muscle mass, and performance... and you get worse joints from not being loose enough, and the weight you can lift doesn't go up as fast.|`|EW9Dgbz7aa	try various times of day, it really depends on your personal preference, as for me i like working out at 10pm!  but you can never go wrong with noon  in the morning you are more stiff and more apt to pulling muscles|`|ACU4Xbmmaa	I think the best time to work out is in the morning because it is not that hot as in the afternoon when the sun is at it's highest.

mS1fej9Jaa	It's not ridiculous. That's EXACTLY how I feel. Over the last year or so I put on about 15 lbs which, when you're 5'3 and female, is a lot of weight. I used to have a smaller frame and a lot more confidence. Lately, I've been trying to get back into gym mode but I feel intimidated by all the "fit" people around me. I just tell myself to take it one day at a time and try not to compare myself to others. We all have to start somewhere. Every week I make small, realistic weight loss, (or in your case fitness), goals. Everytime I achieve one, I get a little bit of my confidence back and it keeps me going. If you really don't have any confidence, fake it. After long enough, it'll start becoming natural to you.    Don't let her take anything away from you. Head back to the gym and get it back.

I have and its not easy to see people when you have gained 25lbs, it is emabrrising.  so the only thing you can do is change the way you are thinking, be confident, be proud you are deciding to get on with your life and GO.  once you start going you will be glad you did.|`|Km74BXFjaa	Do it for your boyfriend/girlfriend.

6nvhmx7Aaa	it sounds like your dilemma sprouts from your workout    for size and strength, you should do the following:    1) Never lift everyday!!! allow at least one day for your body to recover. you can do upper body one day, lower the next, and upper again after that and so on, but takes a lot of time. only EXCEPTION is abs...you can do that everyday. STICK TO M, W, F, or a similar 3x a week routine.    2) Start with things that target large muscle groups and work down to single muscle groups. example is like bench (bicep tricep shoulder upper and lower pecks), incline press (upper pecks bicep tricep shoulder), lat pull (back, shoulder, bicep), butterfly (pecks), then end targeting bicep and triceps only.    3) should do 3 sets of each machine...start with 8 reps, add weight and do 6 reps, add weight and do 4. (pyramid technique). you should only be able to do 8 of that weight and so on. if u can do more...its time to add weight. this method is best for gains.    4) change routine every 3 months because you will start to stop gaining as much "plateauing"    5) dont miss any days because every day u miss, you spend about 2 days getting it back    6) whey only helps a little...shouldn't need any if you eat balanced diet    7) get sleep!    8) dont do too much you first time because you dont want to overwork you muscles so that you can't go in for a week    9) try creotine...it helps your endurance, so your muscles dont poop out on you as fast (extends your lifting limit) but dont recommend until the peak of your gains, or when you start platueing    hope it helps|`|sYxtPBziaa	Only a failed squat at 1200lbs will stunt your growth, lol. Everyday is safe man. You just gotta take 1 day off a week. Lightweight reps? that's why you aint getting results. If you want muscle mass, you torque it. You want to get toned, do as many reps as you possibly can with something you can only lift 10 times. Any protein is good, just make sure it's real protein and not some crappy advertised crap they sell in wal- mart or disney land because that crap is full of Sugar and has little protein. I just finished reading an article myself, posted by another yahoo member, he says, "If you really want to see some good gain in muscle mass, get a full body workout everyday and make sure it includes both squats and bench presses as it can increase your gain by up to 5x." I don't know if that's True, but i have read a great deal on testosterone and how it effects your muscles, so with that proof i'd say that is a very factual statement. If your going for strength, 4 reps to a set. For toning, 8 reps to a set. For mass, 5 or 6 to a set.|`|s4vb9spDaa	If you are lifting weight, you want to build muscle and definition. If want to be a athlete then, Start light weight and 3 sets, high reps (12-15 reps).  ISO Protein will definitely help you repair muscle tissue and help you gain more muscle. Work one or 1-2 muscle group a day for best result. Diet is very important, Lot of fruits, vegetable and fiber. Make sure you take you vitamins and minerals.   Rest is important. I prefer to take a day off after every 3 days. Make sure you get 7-8 hours of sleep a day.   Weight lifting does not stunt growth.|`|IuTnN5ihaa	eat lots of vegatables|`|6LtmIxhCaa	If you haven't seen any changes in 2 years since you started then it is very simple. Change your routine. Take in more calories. Lift harder. Don't over-train. If you answer the same True or False question the same every single time and you are wrong every single time, why would you keep doing it?    It will not stunt your growth at all. It is very healthy. working out everyday is very healthy but you do need 1 day off. Your body needs rest to grow. If you cut your hair every day will it get any longer? No, it won't. Get a routine. Monday- chest Tuesday- Back Wednesday- Arms - Thrudsay Legs- friday off- saturday shoulders- Sunday off.. simple as that. I was 15 when I started lifting weights and I was into sports.

That provides the optimum increase of muscle strength.  Most muscle strength will build in the first 6-8 weeks.      I don't know about the effects of whey protein, sorry.  Hopefully someone else will be able to help you with that.
QwN5Urlxaa	You're doing a good job by setting a goal for yourself, but to be more efficient, set little goals, and acomplish them one by one. You will feel proud of yourself for acomplishing your goal and you won't be soo overwhemled looking at a huge goal!!!  Well, you have about 4 months so that is 7 pounds a month.  Maybe in two weeks say ' i want to lose 2 pounds' then make another goal!!!   For the workout, if depends how busy you are, but if you have time, try to run 3 times a week.  walk for 3 minutes, then jog for 10 at a nice pace, walk 3 more minutes, then jog 20 minutes at a good pace, end with a 8 minute walk, (cooldown)!  Then stretch for 10 minutes!  P.S. cardio will help loose fat, and muscular strength , like situps and pushups define and stretnghen muscles, make sure you do both!! Its important you do.  I don't know what physical level you are at, so i can't be exact, so if you need to change this a little thats alright.   I would do the running three times a week, and stretch at least 20 minutes a day.  Do 100 situps throughout the day, you can break it up how you like, also do some kind of arm workout, wieghts, pushups.   doesn't matter.  have fun with ex.  ride a bike, do lunges, squats, thoose are all really good.  Also do jumping jacks, do 2 minutes of them every hour.  punch and kick the air.  And keep up wiht a good diet!!!! hope i helped good luck you can do anything you want with modivation and determination!!! lucks|`|PBMZKeXoaa	well 28 pounds is a lot of weight to lose but if you realy want to look good to be so concerened as shedding the pounds as putting on the muscle i would run 3x per week and go to the gym 3x per week w/ total body workouts.

In my family I have a sibling who is on meds & doing well & I felt I suffered from it when I was younger but I had to heal myself & I did. I would not recommend anyone else try this cause I really worked hard for years at studying nutrition & psychology, etc. but my point is that there are no rules about it. I guess I want to emphasis this because I think if we envision something we can really make it happen so I would hope no one would live in fear of this cause the mind plays such a huge part on our health.

AA11353824	It'll definitely work if you stick with it though you should be eating more calories each day. It's a great workout routine and diet if you want results fast. I have a friend who did a very similar routine and it worked great for him. Hope things go well.|`|vwjeG8n7aa	Looks decent what you have, but I am not sure what you are working with so I will keep this basic for you.  You always want to start your workout off with a power movement.  The three major exercises to concentrate on are the bench press, squat and deadlift.  Do these on separate days.  You say you workout everyday so I would suggest a 4-1.  Do four days on and one off then repeat.  Day 1- Chest  Day 2- Back  Day 3- Legs  Day 4- Shoulders, Bis, Tris  Day 5- Off cardio, plyometrics and stretch  Repeat  Also take your body weight and multiple by 12 to get your calorie intake.  Make sure you eat six to eight meals a day.  Also make sure you consume your carbs after your workout.  I would also suggest changing your set and reps to 5x5  PS: Never trust the scale, judge yourself in the mirror.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	you will look bulk in a very short time and it really make you look like body-builder men best of luck|`|mqXyDTwwaa	No, you won't look like a bodybuilder. Intense cardio makes you lose muscle mass. And you're not eating enough calories. 190 grams of protein is only 760 calories. Adding the 20 calories of fat makes it 780 calories. So you're either eating WAY too much carbs, or you're not eating enough.|`|553ac7b7fe128bda796c55a6cfb5544daa	A cardiovascular workout will not give you a body builder's body.  Working out hard and intensely will not give you a body builder's body.  Consuming creatine will not give you a body builder's body.    Information I would need to assist you in quest would be your height (you mentioned that you weigh 190 lbs.      In creating a body builder's body both healthfully and successfully requires a great time committment (30-40 hours per week).  It should also be noted that you are still young and hormones are not working in your favor at this point (21 years is typically the age of hormone maturity).  In addition, you need to be very careful as certain exercises if done in excess are harmful to your growth.  As you are 14, legally you aren't permitted to make decisions.  You should know that creatine is harmful to not only your body (destroys the muscle it creates over time as well as tendons, ligaments and joints), but also to your mind (causes long-term brain, irreversible brain damage).     I'm finished with the disclaimer.      You need to balance the amount of protein, carbohydrates and fat you consume.  Body building requires a nutritional balance to achieve the goal successfully.      Creating this balance would include the following foods:  PROTEINS:  Eggs, Chicken, Turkey, Fish (4-6x/week), Beef (3-4x/week), Beans (pinto, kidney, garbanzo, etc.)    CARBOHYDRATES: Whole-wheat pasta, Whole grain rice (brown, basmati, wild, etc.)    VEGETABLES: Spinach, Salad, Broccoli, Celery, Carrots, Sweet Potatoes, Squash, etc.    FRUITS: berries, melons, bananas     FATS:  Avocados, nuts    The group listed above is (overall) the healthiest representatives of each group.      Your goal should be to eat more frequent meals and snacks (about 6 daily--every 2.5 to 3 hours).  In addition, you should drink 16 oz. of water before each meal to avoid dehydration.  I could recommend specific calories amounts (if I knew your height).     Once you have gotten yourself into the habit of eating larger meals more frequently (about 4-6 weeks), you should be ready to start a new fitness plan.      Creating muscle involves two things: stressing muscles and resting muscles.  Without both goals working synergistically, muscle creation is not possible.    Schedule 4 days per week to work out.  Give two days rest before working out the same muscles.  For example: Workout A is Monday and Thursday.  Workout B: is Tuesday and Friday.  Sunday, Wednesday and Saturday go for a walk, cycle, or swim for 20 minutes (no more), and relax (sit in a hot tub, get a massage, etc.) for the most part.    On 'A' days:  Focus on your Deltoid (posterior, lateral, rotator cuff), Pectoral (major and minor), and Abdominal (upper, middle and lower), Gleuteal,   Hamstrings, Abductor, Adductor  muscles.    On 'B' days:  Focus on your Biceps, Triceps, Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius, Rhomboid, Quadriceps, Obliques, and  Calf muscles.    ***I gave the names of muscles as most machines will have these listed (sometimes you can combine muscle groups)***    The MOST EFFECTIVE way to build muscle is using free weights (not machines).      You need to do a test of your body's ability to endure a certain weight.  Ideally, you should be able to complete three set of at least 7 repetitions with excellent form with this particular weight (if not, it is too heavy, decrease the weight).  Your overall goal should be to do between 10-12 repetitions and 3 sets of each exercise at a specific weight.  When you achieve this goal, you can increase weight.  Then build again until you reach the 10-12 reps/3 sets.        This website can give you the demonstrations on how to do these exercises properly.    http://www.myfit.ca/exercisedatabase/wei...    I wish you the best of luck in healthfully building muscle and achieving your desired frame.  Remember that your age is the biggest barrier as your hormones are not mature (and won't be for another 7 years).
7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Usually, from age 12 to age 21, a guy will be going thru puberty with growth spurts occurring along the way.  Many changes will take effect within the body during that time.  These are ALL called growth spurts.  It can be growth in height. feet, legs, hands, arms, penis, torso, muscles, facial hair, body hair, pubic hair, attitude, mood changes, facial expressions, sexual urges, male hormones raging.  Nobody knows when they will happen - they sneak up on you when you're not looking.  There are no quick fixes nor magic potions to hurry things along.  Each person must wait their turn for complete development - and you are no exception.  Everything will happen in due time - and not before.|`|de61674560750ca671798a74d4f68053aa	Yeah every one does have a growth spurt, which should always be in puberty.

Although the problem here is that a growth spurt isn't a defined thing.  A growth spurt is just a short time in where the body grows continually.  This could be over a couple of weeks or even months in where you continually grow and the body doesn't stop.  You will be more hungry and your body might actually ache a little from the growing.    This will happen multiple times through out your life until your around 18 or 19.  It's not only height.  I personally remember two times directly.  Once was 4 inches in about 3 months when i was 13, and the other was i went from a size 40 jacket to a size 46 jacket in about 4 months when I was 19.|`|pWcJ37K3aa	1.Yes 2. 12-14 or 16-19 (then you grow till your like 22) 3. It depends who you are, but defiantly enough to know.|`|5VKBBsA0aa	Everyone, of course, grows throughout their childhood and teenage years. A growth spurt is just a term for a time span in which growth is relatively rapid. Although basically every individual does have this sort of spurt, it is not entirely possible for someone to "overlook" their spurt. Within a year, someone could grow almost a foot if they were lucky.
3YfYWpAsaa	1)eat a lot of protein and eat 5-7 big meals a day. STAY AWAY from hot peppers or anything spicy- they tend to increase your metabolism and make you therefore lose weight, since less of the food turns to meat on you.    2) take a multi-vitamin in the morning w/ breakfast, take 2 calcium/vitD pills a day to keep your bones strong, drink 2 musclemilk: chocolate protein shakes a day (they taste the best, honestly...), get 9 hours of sleep a night, etc.    3) lift weights, 3 sets of 10 of all of these bro... do this routine: (get a gym membership, and do it at a gym.)    mon, wed, fri = lower body    squats  leg press  dumbbell lunges  deadlifts  leg extension  leg curl 5 SETS  standing calf raise  sitting calf raise  knee raises on captain's chair  butt kickbacks  leg abduction  leg adduction    tues, thurs, sat= upper body    bench press  upright rows  incline bench  lat pull  overhead press  assisted pull-ups  chest flies  dips (on the U bar)  overhead pull-down  shoulder shrugs  tricep extension  bicep curl  forearm curl/reverse curl  lower back extensions  ==========================    4) If you want to REALLY gain weight quickly, then you can take creatine. Creatine is naturally created in the body, and has no side effects aside from increased strength, increased water retention in the muscles, and increased IQ.... so it's a good choice if you want to bulk up quickly.    do it for 2 weeks, then do a week without it, then 2 more weeks with it, etc. It is a TRAINING SUPPLEMENT and helps you increase your max with weights.    55 seconds ago - Edit - Delete   Source(s):  The All-Knowing Wrestler has spoken... you have just been enlightened. Hope this helps! (I know it will) lol best answer please! =)|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Time. Stick to you. Get enough sleep. 7-8 hours is sufficent. Anything over 8 hours is usually not doing your body any benefit. Increase your intensity and take in more protein. Work with your technique and form.     The fastest way to increase strength on bench press is by doing lower reps at heavier weight. Warm up extremely light.     Warm Up: 45 Pounds 10 times    First set. 95 pounds for 3 ( I know you can do more, but this will get your body a nice awakening for the heavier weight that is coming. Don't wear yourself out before you can do heavier:    2nd Set: 100 for 3-5 reps    3rd set 105 for 3-5 reps     4th set try to put up 105 again for atleast 3.    Your body will recognize that you ar doing heavier weights and it will naturally , over time, will build more muscle tissue to handle this weight. If you can't do it for 3 reps then you shouldn't being doing it as a set. If you can do it for more than 5 then it's time to move up in wieght by increments of 5 pounds. Take your time and soon enough the weight will start piling up on both ends of the bars and you'll be loving it.    I am 235 at 5'10 with a sixpack still.

You need to increase your upper body strength and believe or not, also your lower body strength.   To increase your strength, light weight and high reps. Instead of doing 95 pounds and 6 reps. Try 85 pounds 12 reps. Increase the weight every set. Keep it up for about 2 months and we you see the improvement  Do Incline and decline press, chest fly. it will work different part of the chest muscle.   Make sure you work your lower body. Squats and splits.  7-8 hours of sleep. No more or less.

As in ones not meant for sexual-arousal. You'll find out that you're normal after all.      Just like men can have bent penises, you can have a funky labia or clitoral hood.      Also, you never know, some people like that!|`|MhpccWpmaa	that's very harsh of him... he shouldn't care what you look like. he should like you for you. personally i don't think any of them are attractive. if he really loves you and you guys are intimate, he's not going to nit pick at your imperfections|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	your bf sounds like a prick, find a new one|`|j8zj6JQPaa	its stupid to judge a girl by how that looks|`|1db16d6fbfe5a357087104b9885f5c27aa	Tell him that's OK.

mAp5lrnSaa	I hear that there is this clear polish stuff that you can get to put on your nails that tastes gross when you put your hands in your mouth.      When you go to bite your nails, stop yourself and try a little introspection.  What triggers you to bite your nails?  Is it stress?  Are you nervous about something?  Are you hungry?    Carry gum with you that has a good flavor to it.  If you chew gum with xylitol, then you'll be helping your nail biting habit and fighting cavities at the same time!  How's that for a win-win situation?!  Hope I helped!  :D|`|fAcVndo7aa	You could try chewing gum instead.    You could try stopping, one finger at a time (this worked for my sister).  Don't let yourself bite one nail, then after a few weeks, stop another, and so on.  It actually worked that after the first 3 nails she didn't even feel like biting them at all.  Keep a rubber band around your wrist, and every time you catch yourself biting your nails, snap it.  Try a commercial product that goes on your nails and makes them taste bad.  You can usually find them in the nail polish section of a department store or drug store.    Good luck.|`|2SQxX4oSaa	dip your fingers in poop.|`|XEeFbieTaa	become conscience of it. when you go to bite your nail, stop,  not put your fingers in your mouth. or try chewing gum|`|WnRy6on6aa	put hand sanitizer on your hands often. it tastes bad and when you put your hand to you mouth, it will taste bad, too.    keeping your nails short is good, too.|`|ko81Laeraa	if your a girl try wearing a thick nail polish becuase this makes your nails much less "yummy" haha although i wouldn't exactally call them that.

If the burn is outside the body depends on the degree 1st and 2nd degree wrap the wound but also let it breath if its a 3rd degree go to the hospital could be bad damage.|`|ACU4Xbmmaa	this may sound crazy but  it actually works. go to the store and buy some colgate toothpaste just dab two dime sized squirts onto the burn and don't forget to put a band-aid over it to!
ENilx3F2aa	Try resting your eyes. If you have been up studying a lot of have been straining your eyes at tv or computer screen for long hours it may cause the same symptoms. if that doesn't help try artificial tear drops. Also if you have very strong perfumes on or if you are in a area that has strong chemicals it may cause eye irritation.

RXI8ImdIaa	Are you talking about fillings - cavities that have been fixed? Or do you mean untreated cavities?    If they have not been fixed, the only thing for it is to have them filled. That's not terribly expensive as long as the damage is not too extensive.    If you're talking about fillings, like the shiny silvery kind, those could be replaced with white resin fillings. It would cost a little more than the silver fillings but not too bad.|`|1nINGDC7aa	The only treatment is Tooth Colored Composite Fillings. For more on these filling you can read in detail in the following website link.... http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|uFiJaR7vaa	white fillings. dont know how expensive but its worth it!!!|`|Yw2Ynm0Daa	yup there is|`|e053d35694c9b45844ae2fafd8dc3ad4aa	White fillings will be the only way to go that I know of. You need to get them filled either way so the cavities don't get worst until the point of needing a root canal or getting them pulled...and they never get better so may as well take care of it right away. Silver fillings are a tad cheaper and may last longer so dentists prefer to use them in places like the back of the mouth where they are not noticeable but I had one in the back where they used silver and I thought it looked bad so I got it replaced with a white filling.   Now you can never tell something was there. So in my opinion it's worth it to pay a little extra for the white so it won't be noticeable which is what you want. I am guessing you have dental insurance so it won't make that much of a difference.
TB12kOefaa	The best thing to do is to go see a dermatologist if this has never happened before.    "Here are some tips to keep skin healthy:    Irritations often can occur due to a reaction from soap, laundry detergent, or other beauty products. If you have recently switched products try to eliminate unnecessary perfumes or scents to see if this helps reduce the irritations.     Sweat can also cause pimples and other irritations, so make sure that you wash your body with cool water and hypoallergenic soap following exercise. Wearing absorbent material will help reduce the amount of time that sweat irritates the body. Also, make sure to remove your clothes and shower immediately following exercise because longer exposures to sweat and dirt cause a greater probability that pimples will occur.     Try not to pop or squeeze pimples.   Make sure that any makeup that is used to cover up these spots is not oil-based and does not contain perfumes.     Eat a healthy diet and make sure to stay properly hydrated by drinking plenty of water."|`|AA10759555	It could be any number of things :viral,bacterial,fungal,pests,allergy...... noticed that a lot of people from all over the US are having this same problem.Now to know for sure you should go to a dermatologist and have them run some tests.Don't just let them tell you it's dermatitis until they do conclusive testing.

When treated early on, a yeast infection can be dealt with quickly and with relatively few complications. The treatments tend to be simple and work in a short period of time. Here are a few examples of common yeast infection treatments.    One of the most common of all treatments for yeast infection are antibiotics. The actual type of antibiotics used will depend on the location of the infection, and how progressed the situation happens to be. Oral antibiotics are used when the infection is relatively minor and can be treated on an outpatient basis. However, intravenous drugs may be required if the situation is serious enough to merit remaining in a hospital for several days.     Along with oral medications, there are also some other treatments that can be used effectively in the event of a yeast infection in the vaginal or anal areas. These include medicated suppositories and douches that can help to wash out any discharge as well as provide topical medication to the surface layer of the infection. Depending on the severity of the infection, these types of yeast infection treatments may be teamed with an oral medication to promote healing from two different approaches.

Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day and do exercise too.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	with that attitude you have no chance, how do you think people loose weight? "wish it away?"
CHiEKZrLaa	I've had excellent success using acupuncture to manage patients' panic attacks.  Patients have reported some improvement after the first treatment, but it takes about a month to get full effects on longstanding problems. - frequent treatments to start; ideally weaning off treatment altogether after a few months.

My breathing stops while I sleep and it doesn't actually wake me, but it comes close enough to keep me from really sleeping.  A sleep study was done on me (I was hooked up to sensors and monitored while I slept.) and it was revealed that I "wake" about 37 times an hour.  I had no idea this was happening.  I just thought I needed more sleep than most people.  So, just because you have a couple of the symptoms of a sleep disorder, doesn't mean squat, right?  There are a bunch of symptoms--too many to list here.  You should take a sleep survey and discuss with your doctor whether or not you should have a sleep study done.  (Like they did with me.)  There are some unhealthy side effects to being sleep deprived that can shorten your life--yes, even at 15.    As a start, check out the link to webmd.com below.

AA11176387	well simple deep breathing helps..In fact if I am hysterical over some problems and call a crisis line they make me deep breathe to clam down enough so I can be understood and it works    Also do this    sit in a comfortable chair with hands at sides or on lap.  Clear your mind, breathe in and out and pick two words..some say ohm I am a christian and say something like Jesus saves or one two..it doesn't really matter what words you choose.    Just focus on your breathing and saying these words..anytime some thought intrudes as soon as you are aware if it, push it from your mind and go back to focusing on breathing and the two words. Relax your muscles while doing it.,    I used this and at the same time tested my blood pressure at intervals and during the course of the ten minute experiment, my blood pressure dropped 20 points which amazed me    So do the progressive relaxation one where you relax each muscles starting with head and eyes and going sown till all its completely relaxed    although I cannot remember the name of the therapy you take tow people and each takes a turn letting the other person talk..they just say things like aw..that's awful  I understand oh no and short statements of empathy and concern like nodding their heads and what not..they do not launch into oh that happened to me once..blah blah blah..then you reverse..they say this technique actually reverse stress and its harmful impact of on the body    for herbs that help:    use organic tinctures    kavakava  chamomile  passionflower  hops   catnip  lemon balm  Valerian best taken at night also helps you sleep    so does breathing lavender (real not synthetic) essential oil just sprinkle on bed clothes, sheets, pillow or breath from bottle or use a vaporizer or diffuser    Lavender also calms you down in the day in addition to helping you sleep at night especially helps sleep when you are worried or cant shut off your thoughts    hops also for sleep and melatonin    rescue remedy (homeopathic flower essence)    also go to youtube ands learn how to do eft    also when very upset consider calling suicide prevention or a crisis line as they help not just people considering suicide but people undergoing problems and duress.  They have helped me so many times. Just goggle the words crisis line and put your state in the search and the numbers will come up for various cities in the state.  if one person doesn't help or has to go before you feel better, call one in another city with toll free number..this helps me tremendously    also doing things like hot oath, walking, distraction like going out a movie, reading, watching tv, journaling. listening to music help     also read the book feeling good for cognitive therapy and take fish oil 3000 mg and eat more fatty deep sea cold water dish like fresh or canned (not farm raised but wild caught) salmon, mackerel, herring and sardines (tuna only has 1/7th the omega three fats as these)|`|RzaoNn4maa	A couple of things work for me for those situations.    Meditation: I sit quietly and concentrate on my breathing, inhaling and exhaling and being aware of the breath. I find i relax in about 5 minutes.    When i have a lot on my mind, which usually leads to 3 or 4 am wakeups when the mind is racing, I journal my days thoughts before bed. When i get them out on paper they don't seem to hover in my subconscious when i sleep.     Herb wise. Passiflora or Valerian, tincture, capsules or tea, taken before bed  will help to get you to sleep. Banyan Botanicals makes and herbal tablet called Tranquil Mind. It works wonders for me. The blend of herbs helps to calm the mind down so it's not over thinking. I take it at night before bed but I will also take some in the late  afternoon if I can't shut my mind off after work. It will not make you sleepy.    http://www.banyanbotanicals.com/prodinfo...|`|768111555ea193cbaa27a5b9ff4a2dbcaa	I find reading winds me down and helps me sleep.

A simplier meditation technique is to simply sit quietly and repeat a simple non-meaningful sound.    Some people just listen to their own breathing.  Some people repeat short prayers.   The repetition or distraction of non-meaningful sounds gives your mind something to focus on other than the stressful issues in your life.|`|5xiAzqXVaa	For this I advice read this book: God's Medicine Is Best by Linda Wise.

Just because you use the chest while doing ppush ups doesn't mean you will increas eon other lifts. When you bench press you use much more than your chest. You use some parts of your back and much of your shoulders. It is a whole different ball game when you compare Push Ups and Bench Press. You may tone up more than bench press will get you but no stronger than maybe 5 pounds ot your overall bench. Focus on bench pressing technique and form to get stronger.    www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartevermad...

hiToH4kCaa	When you have a hard time going to the bathroom, your rectal lining tears because it is really sensitive. Everytime you go to the bathroom you probably tear it a little more which would be why you are bleeding still. Maybe use some Neosporin or something there and eat more fiber and you should be fine. There is nothing to worry about unless you are bleeding a LOT.    Edit: You don't have to go to the doctor at all. You don't even have to tell anyone, unless like I said before if you're bleeding a lot. By a lot I mean you are bleeding constantly. Just eat fiber, use a cream like Neosporin to heal the minor cuts, and maybe wait a day just to be safe. You'll be fine. :).|`|0lCnu1g2aa	Most likely it is hemorrhoids. Does that area itch or burn???

AA10213842	linda is correct. hcv is not an std simply because under normal sexual activity- with or without a condom, there is no blood to blood contact.    hcv corpuscles found in all other bodily fluids will not result in hcv infection even if you have an open wound.  ie, semen, vaginal fluid, tears, mucus, saliva, breast milk do not harbor active or transferable virons. why?

All your symptoms are signs of fatigue.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	You are probably fine, because Hep C is rarely transmitted through sexual activity.  However, it can take up to 6 months for hep C to show up on tests, so just to be sure, get retested 6 months after your exposure.  Also consider testing for HIV.  See your doctor about your symptoms.|`|leJgHlU7aa	i think you'll be fine...but you have to becareful of this stuff! what if she had hiv? she should of told you before you guys had sex..
d1jMmApmaa	Hep C is usually detectable in the blood 1-3 wk. after initial infection.  Antibodies to Hep C are usually detectable within 3-12 wk. If you've tested neg. for the past 3 mo., it sounds like you may be in the clear.  Hopefully, your current symptoms are just nerves.    Some people who have been exposed to Hep C clear the virus from their bodies on their own during the first 6 mo. (also know as the acute phase) and show normal liver function.    Of course, you should wait for the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) results which can detect the Hep C very soon after infection and sometimes before the onset of any symptoms.  PCR can also determine the viral load if you are infected to help expedite the start of treatment as treatment during the acute phase is 9 times more successful than treatment of chronic (long term) Hep C.    Good Luck.  Hope it all turns out for the best!    P.S. That girl should definitely have told you beforehand.  That was extremely irresponsible of her.|`|3e35a0513fedfde324327c2ce1f90a3baa	ur lucky that she told u what she had|`|GgB6bLhTaa	If I had to make a wager on it I would guess you will be fine.  You need to test yourself at 6 months and then a year.  Consult your doctor and he will tell you if there is an "dormant" period for Hep C and how long you need to keep testing.    However, it is your duty as a human being to not have sex with anyone until you figure this out for sure.  And if you insist on having sex, you need to make sure they are well informed you may be putting them at risk.|`|BwwcKjMmaa	Hepatitis C is a parasite stuck to the liver you will not know if you have it sometimes it takes 10 years for a virus to show i have cured this virus

It sounds scary but its not.  Basically its when normal bacteria in the vagina begin dividing at a higher than normal rate.  it's not dangerous, if you go to your gynocologist they will probably prescribe a general anitbiotic which might help it go away.  It tends to come back, however sometimes having a period will alter the pH of the vagina enough to stop the bacteria from over reproducing without any intervention|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	uhm...i think that's normal...i'm sixteen and i get taht...    just girl stuff    ejeculating i guess it's wat its called...or is that for guys only?|`|IVF4lyJdaa	thats normal lol that means your healthy as long as it dont stink and u dont itch..your 20 u said? i cant beleive no one told you lol|`|FdfE8iMEaa	It could be a yeast infection.

Everyone has vaginal discharge; some have it all the time and some only have it every once in a while (like during and after ovulation). You should worry if your discharge is a funny color (like brown, yellow, pink, or a chunky white) or if it starts to really smell. Discharge like that is a sign of a bacterial infection or a yeast infection. Then you should see a doctor to get an antibiotic.    But, you're fine.|`|08TabcNoaa	Completely normal!!!!

In adults, oral yeast infections become more common with increased age. Adults also can have yeast infections around dentures, under the breast and lower abdomen, nailbeds, and beneath other skin folds.

yjWwRMT0aa	Lot of boys discover masturbation at a young age.  According to a survey of over 10,000 males by the web site HealthyStrokes.com in the second half of 2007, 14 percent of males started masturbating at age 10 or younger.    However, the way you do it is not safe.  Masturbating by lying face down and rubbing yourself against the bed is an atypical form of masturbation, a particularly troublesome one called Traumatic Masturbatory Syndrome or TMS.  You can learn more about TMS and how to overcome it at HealthyStrokes.com|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	Some guys enter puberty as early as 8 years old - although the average age is 12.  No, it should not have any negative effect.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Sometimes boys do discover masturbation at an early age.    No, it hasn't had any effect on your hormones, nor will it harm you in any other way.    You're perfectly normal!    Unless masturbation interferes with other activities, there is no such thing as too much. Many teen and pre-teen boys masturbate once or twice a day, and this pattern can continue into adulthood and middle age. More than this or less than this is also quite common.    If you masturbate often, you would want to watch your technique, so as not to chafe the skin on your penis. Other than this, no worries.    It will not interfere with your hormone (testosterone) production, it will not interfere with your growth and development, it will not cause acne, it will not affect your vision, it will not cause hair to grow in your palms, and it won't show. It is also not addictive. Masturbation will not contribute to baldness later in life.    Masturbation will absolutely not affect your future sex life. You will be able to "get off" just fine by other means in the future. It will not cause premature ejaculation (c**mming too fast). You cannot "run out" of sperm or semen, as these are replaced by your body on a continual basis. If you masturbate a good deal, or close together in time, you could notice a temporary reduction in semen, but it will build back up again.    There are some studies showing that regular ejaculation early in life can reduce the incidence of prostate cancer later on.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	The sexual urge is within us from birth. Infants can sometimes be seen rocking in their crib, depending on how strong that urge is in them. With girls, that often involves running water - especially a spa or pool jet. Obviously at that age, you don't have a clue that's what it is; nor that it's anything other than a really nice way to pleasure yourself.     It tends to happen to those with a high sex drive.    Sperm doesn't occur till puberty.|`|1lUxd2t9aa	same thing happened to me except im a girl. i was once lying on the couch and i started to rub myself there i dont remember why and i achieved an orgasm. i was in sixth grade and i love that pleasure feeling and i still do it. i dont know why.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	I love jacking off!|`|z7JDA5tZaa	it's not masturbation. you should have an orgasm. something should come out, not just making yourself a pleasure..|`|hphruXBsaa	WTH+WTF!!!!    dude get a life, stop wasting our time|`|PNS8LZheaa	only an orgasm|`|5VKBBsA0aa	The answer is absolutely yes. At a very young age, like two, children go through a stage in which they literally enjoy touching their gentiles. It is absolutely normal, but societal norms break children of the habit and it is basically forgotten until later in life. Rediscovery of masturbation can occur at basically anytime. I would say 8 years old may be a bit young, but not necessarily. As for harmful effects, no. It is a natural thing and you have nothing to worry about!
gUyBXZYlaa	Nope.  This is probably a coincidence.  Your seizures seem to have a physical cause, not a medical/mental cause.  If the chicken pox and fever caused the epilepsy then that can't be inherited.  Some types of epilepsy can be inherited, but even if both parents are epileptic their kids would only be about 10% more likely to have epilepsy than any other person.    This could be a good thing though.  Since you had seizures you know how to handle them and treat them better than most people would.|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	my daughter had two seizures when she was 4, doctors said it was fairly normal, don't worry too much|`|Zu2oVVhoaa	epilepsy can be caused also by alergic reactions I have hear! If you have a certain type of epilepsy it can be genetic! Judging by the way yours was caused it probably isnt genetic unless it is a resesive gene in your family. I have epilepsy as well and no one in my family has it ... I have no idea what caused it! wait until your son sees the nerologist before diagnosting him with epilepsy!|`|CNhFjXd9aa	um from what i have learned in bio, ummmm it seems to be nature (out side causes) If no one had it in previous generations, it was recessive in you ur family, but if ur son has it, does his other parent have it as a dominant trait? Nothing can change your genes except when they are being made, like chicken pox etc. cant cause genetic mutations. Im not 100% positive though|`|dsu0mvOOaa	Possible there some linkage, just ensure it under control & doesnt get worst CT Scan or brain scan cant do much cos it doesnt  happen during scanning & doc will only ask u to take heavy dosage medicine|`|7bfSRcVEaa	no one on both sides of my family has had any seizures of any type. When I was 8 a car drove through a red light and i was in my dad's truck closet to the door and i hit my head on the side window after that i started having grand mal seizures depending on how a person (my doctor says) obtained them the next generation or father on would not have any. I live in Ohio and my doctor has told me that there is now a type of lazer surgery that can be done to help people be seizure free depending on where it is located in a specific part of the brain and not spread through out. I am now 36 and my doctors asking me to take a test or tests to find out if i could even have it done but i don't know if i would want lazer surgery done even if possible.|`|eYw4Z6mSaa	I'm epileptic and a few of my relatives are as well. My brother's not.

qSI38GAXaa	first, get aroused. think of someone or something that really turns you on. some girls watch porn or look at dirty pictures for this step.  second, if you aren't really wet, get some lotion [i almost always do this, no matter how wet i am... it makes it feel better]  third, get comfortable. make sure you are in a place where no one will walk in on you. some women like to play soft music in the background. lay down and relax.  finally, touch yourself. some girls like to play with their nipples, some like to use a vibrator [if you aren't 18, it may be hard to get one of these], some like to finger themselves, but generally, girls like to rub their clits. start by gently rubbing your clit in an up and down motion. if this feels good, keep doing it. if it doesn't, try something else. sometimes circular motions work better. once you find something that feels good, keep doing it and think about someone you really like. or fantasize about amazing sex. good luck!|`|a9d309a02668bcc66d4d79c7875464abaa	just call me baby|`|tRAHbAL8aa	Rub your clit.

I say when ever you have a good chunk of private time, EXPLORE YOURSELF.   I think for starters, you must be wet.   and then after that, its all about rubbing and feeling around with your fingers. You'll know when you've found the right place. From there, explore different pressures and speeds. Rubbing lightly, like feather like might make you better understand which parts of you are the most sensitive.     You'll get the hang of it. I hope this wasn't too graphic or inappropriate. Its just i think all women should know the joy they can bring themselves. Plus, later, when you get to some activities with another person, you will be able to communicate exactly what sets you off.     Good Luck!
RXI8ImdIaa	Your body doesn't care what month the calendar says. The period comes every 28 days (on average), and a calendar month is 30-31 days.

4RpUP4teaa	Not all bulimics vomit immediately after eating. Sometimes there is a delay of up to ten minutes. This allows time for some food to move on to the intestine. Even while eating, some of the food in your stomache may enter the intestine. Therefore, bulimics do actually digest a bit of food to keep them from losing as much weight as anorexics, but not much. And yes, alot of it is water.|`|h9lPQCOVaa	Because they retain the excess body water. Just because they vomit their food back up doesn't mean they are going to lose weight.

If your going to get your braces, no they don't give you a shot and it doesn't even hurt.|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	No, they don't give a shot. It's doesn't have any pain involved. It only hurts after four hours so take Advil when you get home then you are gonna be fine. Here is some information about braces and exactly what you need to know and check out the websites I give you because they helped me alot. I have braces for 6 monthes I need them for 2 more years.      WEBSITES  1. http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...  2. http://www.bracesinfo.com/  3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...  4. http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...  5. http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...     PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.     DON"T'S  1, Don't eat hard foods.  2. Don't chew gum.  3. Don't stress over it.     FOODS YOU CANNOT EAT  1. popcorn  2. gum  3. carmel  4. apple (whole)  5. Ice  6.nuts  7. peanut brittle  8.hard pizza crust  9. corn on cob  10. ribs  11. chips  12. hard pretzels  13. hard rolls and bagels  14. raw carrots  15. beef jerky  16. corn nuts   17. suckers|`|5jf5tcMnaa	Don't be scared at all.  Getting braces is absolutely painless.  The only thing that hurts about Orthodontics, is when they tighten the braces.  For example when they put elastics between brackets, then it is putting pressure on the teeth to get them to move through your jaw bone, and that can result in some tooth sensitivity.  Otherwise...braces are a snap.|`|1nINGDC7aa	Don't worry. No shots are given as the brackets are just glued to teeth. But after the fixation of braces you can have pain due to wire in brackets which puts pressure to move the teeth but this will go away in 7-10 days and you can have pain killer to tackle it. For more on braces you can read the following very informative website... http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...|`|oQrnizuwaa	don't worry about it...all they do is dry out your mouth a lot. if your teeth are sensitive like mine, it may be very uncomfortable while they are doing it. everything will be fine the minute they are done.|`|tqxoSDNOaa	yeah they give you a shot, but it doesn't hurt.Don't be scared|`|osDGbTncaa	nothing to worry about, it doesnt hurt. u will just be a little sore afterwards, so take tylenol or aleve or whatever pain reliever you take. and your teeth will look so good after the braces are over with. i had it and it was totally worth it!!|`|tgqV6EYfaa	no they dont give u a shot!! it doesnt hurt til a couple hours later. :)|`|0osdNjxhaa	were in da same boat i go on friday 2.

PN5wdj9Daa	You certainly have sewn up the ability give you good advice by stating categorically that you don't want to see a psychologist of any kind.      However, your mom is a gambling addict.  Is she going to GA (Gamblers Anonymous)?  Do you have ANY relatives or friends who are alcoholic?  If you answered yes to either of these questions then you may want to consider attending Alanon or CoDA meetings.  These are meetings for people who have loved ones who are addicts or to whom they are codependent with.  You can find meetings online or face to face by looking them both up or even calling your locally listed AA (alcoholics anonymous) hotline.    www.alanonfamilygroups.org  www.stepchat.com    Another good source is your local church minister.  He can help you by supporting you and giving you hope for your future.  He can pray for and with you and introduce you to other young adults like yourself.  God can and does give people purpose.  I will pray for you too.

TlA1SmrLaa	throwing up blood is never good. i cant tell u exactly what it is because the only time I've experienced this is from drinking too much. And yes it is dangerous. Im not critisizing your lfiestyle, i really dont recomend it, but im focusing on ur health. You need to tell your doctor you are a bulemic and the doc will help u come off of it, or atleast take care of ur bloody vomit|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	get to the hosp you have a bleed somewhere maybe stomach can be dangerous|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Dark brown or black blood is a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, in this case probably your stomach, but perhaps a rupture in your esophagus. You need to go and get an endoscope done.  Never never for any reason make yourself throw up again.  The fact you puked blood means that you have damage in your stomach.  now you have a weak spot and unless it gets repaired, if you throw up again, you could hemorrhage and die before you ever get a chance to get the ambulance there.  Isn't risking your life dumb when it won't even help you maintain your weight?  If you binge, then drink a glass of water every 2 hrs and exercise like a fiend.  It will actually do more for you than throwing up ever would and won't kill you.  Don't exercise until you get to the Dr. though.. you don't want to disrupt the clot that has formed over the damaged spot.|`|DobKxnWBaa	really not  a good idea to be bulimic. especially considering blood is coming out, you probably have internal bleeding which is a definite side affect of bulimia. go to the hospital and tell your parents immediatly|`|z6mbVz8maa	If is blood go to the doctor now!  If is just half digested food, read this:God's Medicine Is Best by Linda Wise, it has info on your problem, you know you need to STOP!|`|4RpUP4teaa	The food that had been in the uppermost part of the small intestine right after the stomach was probably thrown up. This means that the sphincter is getting weak and is not a good sign! The color can be attributed to the various enzymes released, bile turns things brown.    Yes, this is dangerous. This is the sphincter connecting your stomach to your intestine and it is basically malfunctioning as a result of your bulimia. Try to get help, in any way you can.

Do this cardio for at least 30 to 40 minutes in order to help you burn off the body fat.

Ignore the negative comments. Don't get to obsessed about the extra fat. One on my male friends who is into boxing, he is well toned & shaped but when he was 12-15y.o. he was soo chubby it's unbelievable.   Someone mentioned running. Its a good as apart of healthy style but I advice you to tone up with weights or you can use you own body weight. You need to tone up your chest, shoulders & arms (legs would be a plus).    When I was toning up during summer my trainer/dietitian advised me a high protein diet so ate white chicken breast (you can eat any lean meats), boiled egg whites (4-6 eggs), veggies (boiled), beans & oily fish (only once a week) & one key thing no salt, no sugar. (its hard to keep up but its worth it) I stuck with this diet for a month the result was pretty cool, all the fat just kinda melts leaving just muscle remains. You of course you got school & need to concentrate so don't be to strict with it. Do two weeks, than have a rest & two another weeks again. if you really want sugar (I did) I eat fruits and drank a lot of smoothie.    Yet again you can skip all of this and play sport. your still young you bunt it all of in no time.    Any way here is a link.    http://www.nowloss.com/man-boobs-exercis...|`|Mm2yIwGgaa	bench press, cut the carbs, drink lots of water and eat plenty of good foods, including ones high in protien.|`|dVhFitc4aa	yeah cut them off|`|YQk8zW6caa	running/cardio burns fat  run everyday for however long you can go try for a min of 10 min.  cardio is key though  do some weight training too it revs up your matabolisom and gives you muscles and eat well!  push ups target your chest musles.|`|wJoMKfvqaa	I suggest tightening your "manboob" muscles for ten seconds at a time with a five second break inbetween each time.  Hey, it worked for my cousin haha.
DFTB95BQaa	An easy way is to become a vegetarian. Meat is full of fat and that includes chicken and fish. Most people going to a vegetarian diet do lose weigh and keep it off.    Plus you would be healthier overall since there is so much crap in meats.        Edit = "can i eat fruits and veggies for supper at thats it."    Is this directed at me? Well, it doesn't really matter who it's for. The answer is no. There is also grains and dairy products. Believe me there's plenty of good dishes to make even when you don't eat meat but because we are so meat oriented we have a hard time getting started. Just grab a vegetarian cookbook and explore.    Also, a lot of dishes that usually include meat are just as good without. Such as lasagna and chili just to name a couple.    One thing I forgot in my original answer is the importance of cooking your own food. Prepared foods are full of things that are not so good for us including, in a lot of them, sugar.      If you're interested, the book that turned me into a vegetarian is "MAD COWBOY: Plain Truth from the Cattle Rancher Who Won't Eat Meat" by Howard F. Lyman. I already knew a lot of what he talks about but reading it all together in one book is what did it, I think. And, btw, Lyman himself lost an amazing amount of weight when he went meatless.|`|1oGBByMIaa	keep on runing and swiming|`|jvHIqtp2aa	If you are really looking for more weight to lose, you can have some of mine.|`|AA11788494	you will find it maybe.

Keep it up.|`|679b6c2e3d98d5af9b9c37cd3490d71daa	just keep it up you may come to a stand still and it will take a couple days but then you will start dropping again|`|sxKjYyXsaa	Try foods with less calories and more fiber. Apples and oatmeal are healthy and filling. Also, keep your workouts consistent. Try the treadmill every other day and eliminate the word "sometimes."

Good luck.|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	just keep eating right and drinking tons of water. sounds like you are doing just fine. you don't want to loose too much weight too soon. it looks like you are losing weight just the way you should be.|`|KzNoxRwbaa	HERES THE THING i am a body bulilder my self and i know lots so listen and learn eat all naturial foods fruits veggies and nothing more fish and meat if ok to as long as you watch the sauces. buy a protien shake run every second day and then drink it eating man made foods is okay too as long as they are low in fat and has a bit of sodieum keep running and working out untill you feel so weak you cant hold your arms streight no more and soon it will pay off and go to this site weekly to see the results have fun and dont loose faith modivaion is everything. http://www.am-i-fat.com/body_fat_percent...
mqXyDTwwaa	There's no way to tell. You didn't tell us how much of each item you eat, so there's no way to determine total calories consumed. You also didn't tell us how far you walk, or how fast, or how much time it takes, so there's no way to determine total calories burned.
3BGJETHYaa	Fitness isn't measured by skinnyness.  In fact, unless you gain some muscle, you will always be able to see some fat.  If you are a skinny person and you reach the point where you have no visible fat, you will be in danger of dying from malnutrition- you need a bit to survive.  Instead, the best way to hide the amount of fat you have is with some muscle.  You don't have to be ripped- just toned.      Its pretty normal to have fat on the body- but if you want to get a defined figure, join the swim team or some other sport and ask your coach or some one who know something about nutrition what you should eat.    EDIT:   Ablines?  Those are easy.  Work out, but eat a bit more(so your body has material for the muscle).  She has ablines because she has muscle there, not because she has no fat.  Sit ups, crunches, 6-12s, side twists, etc all help.|`|3meIiIsmaa	You're 12 - and your body will change when you go through puberty -- in the meantime, eat healthy, and drink lots of water (up to 1/2 your body weight in ounces - for example-if you weigh 90 lbs -drink up to 45 oz.)  - and walk for excercise every day if possible ( 20-30 minutes) -You can do stretches and sit ups to firm your tummy.|`|RPIVHQX5aa	Run Run Run|`|F1ZwUmzYaa	It's baby fat, it'll go away when you grow.|`|9WrqJ6Ueaa	regular sit ups harden your bellly. for thighs. squats|`|xVMtfuWPaa	you're only 12. quit your whinning.|`|ZQjeuTdzaa	eat healthy but dont eat less, you can even eat more if you like just stick to healthy foods|`|NOxIGcMgaa	if its on your thighs and fat, you're on your way to gaining more weight.

AA11693263	It could be a number of different throat infections. If your pain isn't getting any better you need to go see your doctor. For now, before you get to the doctor you can gargle with some warm salt water. This does two things, it soothes your throat for a little bit of relief and it is also will help kill the germs in your throat to help you get better quicker. You also need to take some Advil to help with the pain and to reduce any swelling that's going on. You can also drink some cold liquids to numb it more. I use Chloraseptic Throat Spray as well. It is a spray that numbs your throat. If you get a really high fever or feel like your throat is closing get medical attention immediately. Other than that, just get to your doctor as soon as you can so he can get you tested for strep and other infections and get you started on antibiotics if you need them. You can also ask him about him prescribing you a gel form of Lidocaine that you can gargle with and it works 10 times better than the Chlorseptic spray. I hope you are feeling better soon. :)|`|UZxeBrxQaa	This may well  be a strep infection.  You need a throat culture to ensure you are pursuing the right treatment.       If you don't, be on the lookout for a redness, or rash on your face or body.  This used to be called "Scarlet Fever".  It is the second stage of an untreated strep infection.    Left untreated, this bacterial infection can eventually cause heart damage.|`|gRwYBmKQaa	everyone I talk to lately has this same thing,I'm not sure where your from,but i'm in the lower mainland area,in b.c.,and everyone seems to have strep throat,or bronchitis.You should see the doctor,because it sounds like you may need some antibiotics.Get well soon:)|`|qyqxp4abaa	Pseudoephedrine will dry out your mucous membranes and contribute to the discomfort.  Try an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen or aspirin.  Topical treatments may also work, but target the inflammation first.|`|db2fba6816023455392d2b12257ae4fbaa	go to the doctor. whatever you have might be a bacterial infection like strep throat and you will need an antibiotic to get rid of it.|`|5QIzu4ePaa	There is also the possibility that the mucus breaking up is draining into the back of your throat and it is causing Irritation.   Another one is that you could have strep. This is usually accompanied by fever and achiness. Discontinue the use of Sudafed and try some home remedies such as the hot water in a bowl towel or the head technique. If you are experience fever and chills see your doctor and have a Strep culture taken...hope you feel better soon.

yjWwRMT0aa	I don't think your problem is masturbating.  Your problem is sleeping lightly.  Males have several erections every night.  About one every 90 minutes.  It is no surprise that you have one when you wake up.  I don't think the erection is WHY you wake up.  It is just that you notice it when you do.  I hope knowing this makes it easier to ignore the erection and just go back to sleep.    According to a survey of over 8000 males by the web site HealthyStrokes.com in the first half of 2007, 48 percent of masturbation takes place at bedtime.  If you find that you masturbate frequently when you go to bed, you're not the only one.|`|7d281f9b4fc45d76f68621de3af55bc7aa	If that's all you've got to worry about - then congratulations!

He probably needs a new study and a change in settings.|`|y4XOe4kUaa	I too have sleep apnea. What most folks don't seem to realize is that with age, your body changes. Lots of things affect sleep apnea sufferers. If your husband stops breathing even when he is using his CPAP machine, something is definitely wrong, he needs to see his doctor asap. If he won't tell the doctor what's happening, then by all means, you should. That's what happened to me. I was trying to play the "tough guy" thing and wasn't being completely honest with the doctor, my better half stepped in and squashed my tough guy image, LOL. Truth be told, she probably saved my life.    Here's what I think, first and foremost he needs to see the doctor. He may need a new study. Your pressure needs change over the years. I recently had a new study done and discovered that my pressures have gone from an eight to a ten. We also learned that my mask was leaking really bad in my sleep. Second, find a medical service provider, perhaps the company that provided your husbands CPAP machine, have the machine tested to make sure it is indeed putting out the correct pressure, CPAP machines are just like anything else, they can and do break down. The worst thing you can do is stand by and wait for it to fix it self, it won't. I hope I've been able to help you.|`|j9YiR51Xaa	Best advice is to notify your doctor of this AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

This doesn't mean gain muscle and lose fat this means lose all fat. Have him go on walks, cut out red meats, fat, soda, beer, and smoking of anykind if he does. Its quite amazing what losing a little bit of weight will do for the human body. Another thing is have a brain scan done on him to make sure that the lack of oxygen to his brain has not caused any damage. Damage to the brain could cause many health problems including (but not limited to) Strokes and Seizures. Best of luck to you and your husband
Q6ig8k7Xaa	Doing ab workouts is definitely a good thing, but having a six pack, or a flat stomach is more about your body fat percent.    For some people it is going to be very hard to lose that last little bit of weight, but you do it in the usual way, diet and exercise.    Eating healthy is not expensive. Eat lots of vegetables which are very cheap. You can buy a pound of carrots for under a dollar    Drink lots of water, cut out sugar and extra calories from junk food.|`|qhBf44BJaa	Do as many sit ups as you can in about three minutes each night. By doing them quickly you build lean muscles as opposed to bulky ones.

Drink only water and bring your heart rate up. Try a slow jog instead of walking. Sprinting will elevate your heart rate too high to burn fat.  The key is to allow your fat to pass through your bloodstream, which a cardiovascular workout has been proven to do. Pill's are a waste of money. Milled flax seeds are a great source of Omega-3.

There is no certain age to start. you can start whenevr you feel like it. It is extremely healthy for you.     First you need to get into a gym and lift weights. Take in protein.

553ac7b7fe128bda796c55a6cfb5544daa	Your body mass index (BMI) is about 18.5.  Congratulations you are at the start of the normal range!!   Congrats also for giving yourself several months to achieve your goal!!      The keys to gaining weight for training purposes are:     You need to balance the amount of protein, carbohydrates and fat you consume.  Soccer is a sport that requires you to have energy for long periods of time (unlike body building), hence the need for nutritional balance.  In addition, to gain weight, you should be consuming anywhere between 3350 and 3500 calories per day (based on some rough calculations, you are burning about 3200 per day (approximately 1500 without any extra work because your metabolism is so efficient).    Creating this balance would include the following foods:  PROTEINS:  Eggs, Chicken, Turkey, Fish, Beef (1-2x/week), Beans (pinto, kidney, garbanzo, etc.)    CARBOHYDRATES: Whole-wheat pasta, Whole grain rice (brown, basmati, wild, etc.)    VEGETABLES: Spinach, Salad, Broccoli, Celery, Carrots, Sweet Potatoes, Squash, etc.    FRUITS: berries, melons, bananas     FATS:  Avocados, nuts    The group listed above is (overall) the healthiest representatives of each group.      Your goal should be to eat more frequent meals and snacks (about 6 daily--every 2.5 to 3 hours).  Each meal should consist of about 500 calories; lunch and dinner should be somewhere between 600 and 800 calories each.  In addition, you should drink 16 oz. of water before each meal to avoid dehydration.     Once you have gotten yourself into the habit of eating larger meals more frequently (about 4-6 weeks), you should be ready to start a new fitness plan.      Creating muscle involves two things: stressing muscles and resting muscles.  Without both goals working synergistically, muscle creation is not possible.    Schedule 4 days per week to work out.  Give two days rest before working out the same muscles.  For example: Workout A is Monday and Thursday.  Workout B: is Tuesday and Friday.  Sunday, Wednesday and Saturday go for a walk, cycle, or swim for 20 minutes (no more), and relax (sit in a hot tub, get a massage, etc.) for the most part.    On 'A' days:  Focus on your Deltoid (posterior, lateral, rotator cuff), Pectoral (major and minor), and Abdominal (upper, middle and lower), Gleuteal,   Hamstrings, Abductor, Adductor  muscles.    On 'B' days:  Focus on your Biceps, Triceps, Latissimus Dorsi, Trapezius, Rhomboid, Quadriceps, Obliques, and  Calf muscles.    ***I gave the names of muscles as most machines will have these listed (sometimes you can combine muscle groups)***    The MOST EFFECTIVE way to build muscle is using free weights (not machines).      You need to do a test of your body's ability to endure a certain weight.  Ideally, you should be able to complete three set of at least 7 repetitions with excellent form with this particular weight (if not, it is too heavy, decrease the weight).  Your overall goal should be to do between 12-15 repetitions and 3 sets of each exercise at a specific weight.  When you achieve this goal, you can increase weight.      This website can give you the demonstrations on how to do these exercises properly.    http://www.myfit.ca/exercisedatabase/wei...

W1tx1p2iaa	Having treated many shaken babys and abused kids, it is a horrible thing.  Babys are blind, paralysed, on ventilators and so on.  The ones who survive have life long disabilities.  Most are under a year but can happen up through toddlers.  Infants are more vulnerable as they are unable to run away and the necks are poorly developed.|`|zgBelCROaa	there isn't really an age. If you shake a young kid hard enough you can hurt them or kill them. It is more dangerous for babies because they are smaller and less developed. I don't think it is a syndrome but rather when an adult hurts a baby or kills him by shaking him.|`|6yVyylqBaa	Its called post Pardom depression|`|Mula85EKaa	This is a sad question and the age has no limits on toddlers and it is serious so study more and be an advocate for this would be a start for others to know the dangers of on losing self control to a infant how sad is that.....Many toddlers die from this every day and that is sad .|`|cWP73qEsaa	i dont get the post partum depression answer.. what does that have to do with anything? i saw a forensic show and even a 2 year old toddler can suffer from shaken baby syndrome and not just by being shaken violently but also by playing rough flipping in the air or sudden jerking movements. never ever play rough with a child no matter their age because they are defenseless and our strength triples theres. we can do a lot of harm without even realizing it.
TE9Pbk0faa	okay.  neither braces nor brackets hurt.   i promise you, you have nothing to worry about.  as you probably know..braces are the square metal things cemented to your teeth conjoined with a wire and pretty elastics.  brackets are the EXACT SAME THING minus the wire running across your teeth and the elastics.  but they do serve different purposes. braces are to move your jaw structure around along with your teeth...to make them straight.    trust me. dont worry about anything.  i had braces for 7 YEARS. haha and i honestly miss them. not gonna lie. and btw, im 16.    so good luck tomorrow.  dont stress yourself out.  the processs doesnt hurt. they dont use any tool. maybe the pointy stick thing to press it on your tooth. and they use a cute little brush looking thing to spread the glue on.  haha if you have any questions just email me.    hope i helped :)|`|X9lIF4baaa	brackets are metal things that go on your teeth that join the wires together for braces.. i don't think they hurt, but if you get your braces tightened that might hurt|`|wq9qCs2Gaa	i just got braces two days ago.  brackets are somewhat the same as braces but they dont do the same things.  and they do not hurt unless they are not put in right, and if you have a good ortho, you have nothing to worry about.|`|Y8RznRGjaa	trust me they dont hurt the first answer is correct of what brackets are.. But trust me you cant even feel it...|`|99MYd45Xaa	Brackets don't hurt.     The only thing that might cause a small amount of pain in your mouth, is if the inside of your mouth is delecate and the brackets irritate it. You shouldn't be afraid though, because I have no doubt that your orthodontist will give you wax. It's usually clear, and you put it on the brackets so that they're smooth, and don't rip your cheeks.     Another thing is, if you take some tylenol or something before you go to the orthodontist, you will barely feel anything.     I wouldn't be so afraid, if I were you.  I've had braces for almost 5 years. (Hopefully I'll get them off soon.)   I've been through it all.

RXI8ImdIaa	It's entirely possible that it is a pimple. You can get pimples, rashes, dry skin, etc. on your penis just like anywhere else.    What you want to look for is whether or not it spreads, fills with fluid and bursts open, or anything unusual like that. Anything that's not like a normal pimple.    Also, if you start to get these bumps in a line, that would probably be scabies. Look very closely and see if you can find any very small, faint brown lines in the area. That's another sign of scabies.    As you can tell, simply noticing red bumps isn't really enough information to tell anything for sure. I'd wait and watch for a few days.

F5v5Qme0aa	Instead of 3 big meals, do 5 small ones.  And of course, you know they need to be healthy, balanced meals.  Someone once explained to me that our body's metabolism is like a burning fire.  If you pile too much wood on it at once, you'll smother it and it won't burn. If you feed it slowly, the opposite happens.  Also, a 20 minute walk around the block when you get home from work will help you burn calories and unwind.  Losing weight and being healthy go hand in hand.

I've got a short one however.    Lose that layer of fat on your abdominals.  Depends on your genes.|`|qD3r5sfCaa	Strengthen your abdominal muscles and lose body fat. You can have the most toned and defined abs but they won't show through if there's a normal layer of fat over them.    To build muscle, do sit-ups, crunches, leg lifts, jackknife sit-ups, V-ups, and planks. Make sure you train your oblique muscles- a lot of people forget those. You should also lift weights. The more muscle your body has, the more calories your body burns, even at rest. Many people are afraid of getting huge due to weight lifting, but the huge body-builders out there have been body-building for years to get that way. Since you want your abs to show, you should be eating fewer calories that you burn, and your body can't build a large amount of muscle without excess calories, so you shouldn't have to worry about this potential problem at all. If you just do cardiovascular exercises without lifting weights then you will be weak and it will take longer to lose that fat. So, to get rid of that fat quickly lift weights combined with cardiovascular exercises. Running, biking, swimming, stair climbing, jumping rope, tennis, volleyball, dancing, martial arts or any other activity that keeps you moving is a great way to burn fat. However, a cardiovascular workout should be performed for at least 20 to 30 minutes straight. Prior to this your body will simply run on its stored energy, which results in minimal fat loss. Cardiovascular training should always be done after your weight lifting workout. While lifting weights, you use stored, (carbohydrate) energy, thus, by performing cardiovascular exercises after weight training your body will have less stored energy to use and go straight into the fat storage for its energy use. Some think the best way to shed fat fast is to do cardiovascular exercises right when you wake up. The theory is that your body will search for energy to use, and when it finds nothing in your stomach, it will go directly to your fat reserves for energy. Others say that the first thing you should do in the morning is eat, to get your metabolism going earlier.    Every meal you eat should include lean protein. Cut down on the size of your portions. If you're hungry, snack on fruits or other low calorie snacks. Large dinners tend to hurt a fat loss process because most people aren't very active after dinner. This is the basis for advice along the lines of "don't eat anything within N hours before going to bed". The claim that your entire dinner is stored as fat isn't entirely true (the process is more complicated than that) but the fact you don't move after dinner is enough to hurt your cause. You can offset this by eating a larger lunch or snacking healthily before dinner. Fresh fruits or vegetables are excellent choices for curbing appetite not to mention other health benefits. A handful of nuts might do the same. Drink a large glass of water before sitting at the table.    Eat More Fiber. Most people don't get enough fiber. The recommended amount is actually not that much if you eat a healthy diet. "Fiber foods" include whole grains (white bread simply won't cut it) , fruits and vegetables, and nuts and seeds.    Motivation is key. If your motivation source is purely the result, you will not last very long. It's important to enjoy the exercise, the immediate and long term benefits and to incorporate enjoyable activities into your exercise routine. It may help to use a record-keeper or plan book for your exercise program. Exercise journals are fantastic for this purpose because as you enter daily information in the journal, you're putting together a complete record that can be referred back to in the future.    If you are already skinny, but simply don't have the abdominal muscle that you want, passively exercising while doing other things can help a great deal. If you spend a long time in a sitting position, try continuously clenching your stomach. Get in the habit of doing this for hours at a time and you may be surprised at its effectiveness.    Look up "Red Fraction" by MELL. I listen to this whenever I exercise. Its the best. I didn't like it at fist, but now I can't help but want to train when I hear it.

PeCm21meaa	can you drink?  cuz you could have powerade or gaterade or something like that... if you can't drink either... hmmm i'm not sure what you could do without eating to get energy... i'd just suggest eating lots of protein the meal before that time period, because it takes six hours to digest and therefore will continue to give you energy for much longer than other foods!|`|B12E4rYiaa	You should be able to drink something or suck on some hard candy to get a little bit of sugar energy. If that don't work you may not be getting enough sleep and need a nap.|`|AA12169920	Considering you asked the same question three times in one minute, I'd say you might lay off the sugar and caffeine|`|kbLHHXyuaa	Energy is stored as glucose or fats in your body. So, I would eat lot's of carbs the night before. Store up on carbs, then you should have an extra energy boost, and you shouldn't need to worry about gaining weight.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Caffeine is your best bet in this situation. That's if you ABSOLUTELY have NO WAY of getting any food between these long periods. I am sur eno one can stop you from eating though. Food is the way you should go.
QsCPOHAraa	Well, we ultimately need to eat for energy of course. Something cannot come from nothing, so this really isn't all that possible. But I assume you mean quick or immediate energy, right?    Well, that energy can be released or harnessed in a number of ways. Exercise, I believe, would be the best way. True that exercise is an expenditure of energy, however, it will also release stored energy within your body. That's why you feel pumped after a workout.    I hope you're not avoiding food for the wrong reasons though! If energy is what you want, simply eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and exercise regularly!
ETcBRko3aa	Hi -     I suggest that you become a CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocate) for Foster Children.  It is a volunteer position, where you are appointed by the Family Court System to be the VOICE for a abused child (in foster care).    You have to goto training and then you can pick a child to work with.  You usually form a very close bond with that child and spend time weekly.    Most children in foster care have been abused.|`|Su0LaNhoaa	I just read this book called comeback by claire and mia fontaine an the girl in th book got sexually abused by her dad when she was a baby and i know she helps some organizations....google claire and mia fontaine or comeback and i think you should find something
5UCOzogPaa	Get a head start now, i mean then you have room for mistakes, and room to get used to eating healthier.  Changes: NO soda! No chips/fries/ cookies/ anything obvious like that.  You have a lot of time, so don't freak out and stop eating or anything.  I would just start to eat about 6 small meals a day, breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner and a snack where you need it in between one of those.    Fruits and veggies are wonderful (:  good luck!|`|kNLi16C6aa	i think if you start now, then you are making a head start, that way you can re-evaluate how you are going, and maybe crank up your sessions closer to the day.     Maybe start with just increasing your heart rate 3 times a week, via running or swimming. 30-40min workouts.  Eating healthy, have serves of vegetables and fruit, and lessening the foods that contain fats and sugars. Drink more water too.    You can reward your efforts with a new bikini or something that will flatter your fantastic new body shape.|`|Dlj76n2daa	i have the same problem! i am going on a 3 day field trip to camp... i get embarrassed when people see me sooo do 30 min jogs every day and cut on fatty foods and sweets...|`|k1WJ3ocYaa	The pattern for losing weight is not difficult - eat less and move more - the issues appear when we really try to put that into practice!

AA12357988	Clots are normal.  You're lucky you didn't have them pre-Depo.  I've always gotten them with my periods.  If you're soaking through more than 1 pad an hour, you should probably call your doctor and possibly go to the ER.  Other than that, it's probably normal.  Your body changes as you get older, and the Depo changes things, too.|`|I370yFWQaa	I used to be the same way before I went on BC. I would have to heavy days and 4 light days. During the heavy days I would pass some horrible clots but I figured it's just normal.
YzZyorkfaa	You have to eat a lot of proteins (eggs, chicken, steak, etc) because that is what your body uses to create muscle. If you don't eat enough protein and you workout, you could be losing muscle along with fat. To add more muscle and lose the fat, keep it up with the weights and make sure your meals are mainly composed of proteins.|`|3b913qbjaa	go work your aaass off at your local gym|`|s4vb9spDaa	Start doing cardio 25-30 mins a day, along with your weight work out.

But by run i mean actually run at least 6 mph if not more.  Then to build up muscle like you said lift some weights.  Do a few upper body exercises and some pull ups.  You wont need to worry about lifting with legs because running also build a lot of muscle in the legs.      Do the running 4-5 times a week and lift every other day.|`|6c1tDSqqaa	Yikes! you can lift me, and then some. If your that muscly losing that fat will make you something else.

a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	Ovarian cysts can cause cramps that feel like period cramps. The brownish red discharge is probably your period. Your ovarian cyst will probably rupture and leak out when your period starts if it hasn't already. Your period flow might be a little heavier than normal due to the ovarian cysts. Chances are the ovarian cyst will be gone after you period is over and so will the sharp pains. It is not good to sleep with a tampon in. There is a chance of getting TSS if the tampon is left in for too long. Do you plan on sleeping for 8 or more hours? If so, a tampon is not a good choice. Doing that could increase your chances of developing TSS. I have a friend who almost died from TSS.It was scary. Be careful. I hope you feel better soon.|`|CS3W706xaa	that red brown discharge is your period blood|`|Z0Gr5ongaa	first of all... have you gotten your first period? if not then the brownish red stuff mixed in your discharge is your first time! thats the way mine started when i was 12. secondly, you can wear a tampon to bed if you sleep for 8 or less hours. remember: if you leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours than you might get TSS.|`|kMEG4tKVaa	ok well first off the discharge is probbably ur period. if u want to make sure ask a parent. Second off no its best if you dont sleep with a tampon in cause most people don't sleep less than eight hours. also my aunts friends kid died of TSS from wearing a tampon for like 6 hours so i wouldn't wear one for more than 5 hours. hope this helps.
Ms72jNbBaa	I'm told that not all acidophilis is created equal - some is sterile and cannot colonize to bring the intended protection.  Dr. Nan Kathryn Fuchs advertises a probiotic that is not "a cruel hoax."  I'll probably try it.    A doctor who charges $95 for a 15-minute phone consultation told me about three things to take, and they do seem to be helping: Bioset DIGESTION, an enzyme supplement; ALOE IMMUNE; and E-lyte CHLORELLA.    I'm also trying COLOTOX.  They don't tell you, but you shouldn't take it for longer than seven days in a row - it has cascara sagrada in it.    I'm seeing a gastroenterologist in February.  That's a resource I just learned of, though my earlier doctors knew about my agony for the past five years.  We'll see what that turns up.  Someone told me today that there truly is treatment available for IBS.  She said that I should work with a naturopath if I hit a dead end with the other specialist.

For example if I grow a beard it is reddish brown, where my hair is light brown. My body hair is a different shade of brown.

I think you just need to forget about it, you're fine now aren't you?  I am not sure what actually happened to you but it's unlikely you stopped breathing for a couple of minutes.  In hot weather  like that you need to make sure you are drinking enough water, most people think all you need is a couple of glasses a day, you actually need to be sensible in hot weather like that and have about 3 litres - it's probably lack of hydration that made you "woozy".

lAZWTLtRaa	Try using a scrub. And use face wash. Stay away from proactive, once you stop using it your face gets worse than it was before you started using it (this is what I've heard). Use face cream as well, but make sure these products do not irritate your skin because that will only cause more breakouts/rashes.  For oily skin: use toner. You can also get these little blue papery things that remove oil from your face (I'm not sure what they're called, I've only seen people use them).   In two days I don't think you'll be able to clear up your face, it takes time.  Try using cover up or concealer just for when you get your award. I've seen people use powder (that matches their skin tone) to hide redness (sorry, I'm not sure what this is called either >  Anyways hope this helps and goodluck!|`|hmAA75lnaa	You need to take flaxseed oil and get a scrub for your face.

Puberty is the time in your life when you begin to become an adult.     This means a lot of growing and changing - both inside and out. Some girls start puberty at age 9 or 10 where others may start as late as age 15 or 16. Each girl goes at her own pace. So don't think you're weird or something is wrong if you start puberty a little later than your friends.    At the beginning of puberty, you'll notice that your breasts are developing and you're starting to grow a little hair under your arms.    For most girls, their first period begins about 1 and 1/2 to 2 years after breast development starts. In some girls, the time from the beginning of puberty to getting the first menstrual period may take only 6 months, where as for other girls, it may take longer and can take up to 3 years.     Every girl is different, and there is a wide range of normal development during puberty.    A good sign you're getting close to the time when your first period will arrive is if you notice a thick, white mucous discharge coming from your vagina. Usually, this happens for a number of months before you get your first period. This happened to me.    Once you get your period, you may once again worry about whether you're normal. No two girls' periods are exactly alike. Some girls have periods that last for 2 days, and other girls have periods that last for more than a week (like me). Some girls have very heavy periods with monthly cramps, and others have much lighter periods after the first couple of days.    It also takes a while (sometimes 12 to 18 months) for a girl's period to become regular after her first period. You may get your first period and then not have another for a few months. That's perfectly normal. The amount of blood you lose during your period can vary, too. You can bleed anywhere from a few spoonfuls to a cup (240 mls) of blood each time you have your period.    If you think that you are bleeding too much or are worried that something is wrong, you should consult with your doctor. Some differences are normal, but you shouldn't be bleeding for a few weeks at a time or going more than 6 months without a period.    I would recommend that if you feel a little worried or anxious about getting your period, it can help to talk to someone you trust, like your Mum, an older sister or a close friend.    All I can add to say is to be patient, stress can cause periods to become delayed. It will happen when your body is ready.|`|cLQM1jqmaa	age 9-16... I started the month before my 13 birthday. But the day before I was extremely tired, also I had a lot of discharge.|`|gpmXxu0Zaa	I have known girls that haven't gotten their period until they were 15... You have nothing to worry about.|`|XgwGxdb3aa	:O me neither! im 13 almost friken 14 in feb and hell i dont period. im like exactly like you but of course im a stick-skinny girl that isnt developed yet. i want mine. i feel like a loner since all my friends started and they werent even developed or anything! GRRR!       anyway.  discharge is the biggest sign. and so look out for that.
Jp6MJ4t9aa	Are you sure this happened to the tooth or between the teeth? If it happened to the tooth it might be a fracture which is very common, it doesn't necessarily means that your teeth are not healthy. If it happened between your teeth then what came off was "calculus" lets say food that attaches to and between the teeth and gets mineralized (really hard like a rock) due to a poor dental hygiene especially not flossing your teeth everyday. Or we could be talking about a cavity which could definitely led to loss of the crown
08n0UP7vaa	Yaz is definitely a great birth control pill and I've been on Yazmin too and both worked really well for me, the fact that it has more estrogen (Yazmin) will only mean that it could cause weight gain, breast increase, yeast infections... BUT don't fear it, every woman is different, just try it and see if you like it. If you're really conviced that you want Yaz then check your local Planned Parenthood to see if they offer any services that will make all of your birth control free (My Yaz is free from Planned Parenthood Family PACT program)  or even substantially cheaper! Woman have more options than they think these days and you should definitely take advantage of services that benefit you and help you take care of yourself!    Where there's a will there's a way!|`|kAblN2YTaa	i think you should talk with your dr about that one it depends how the different amounts of hormones react with your body|`|I370yFWQaa	Yaz is a lower dose form of Yasmin. You could be fine with it, but you might not. You should probably talk to your doctor about it.|`|fLdEOmPVaa	Yaz is different from Yasmin in that there is a hormone in it that Yasmin does not have.    If you are certain that your current pill is what is causing the headaches then I say yes, you should switch pills.  Yasmin is a good pill. I was on it for a couple years before I switched, strangely enough, to Yaz (because of insurances reasons). Yasmin, without insurance is about $70 in the states without insurance. The generic is probably about $50 without insurance. Expensive, yes, but less so than Yaz.  Try looking into Wal*Mart's discount pharmacy list. Or look into planned parenthood for cheaper ways to get your pill.

XFVUejr4aa	Well it's not pure blood. It's blood, uterine tissue and mucus but the blood which is in the menstral discharge is the same as the blood that runs through your veins. So if your blood type is type O- than the blood content in your menstral discharge will also be type O-|`|ZA18KoC9aa	yes- its coming from your body!|`|cLQM1jqmaa	WEL I GUESS YES BECAUSE ALL PERIOD BLOOD IS OLD BLOOD|`|XDf8xSyyaa	Yes it will be the same blood-type.|`|SBoOs1Ezaa	why is this excluding o negative?? i have o negative blood, so if it is different, what kind of blood is my period???|`|C0LZRO2Laa	yupp =]|`|UB7pWWHeaa	I think she meant "especially" and yeah it's the same ol' blood|`|okdPuy1Kaa	YES!|`|I370yFWQaa	Yes. It's all coming from the same source so there's no reason for it to be different.|`|oluzjSgjaa	yes your blood comes from your body, so it is the same, but contains clots, and uterine lining as well.    but if you are pregnant, then baby's blood can by different, because baby's circulatory system is separated from yours by the placenta.
oACfresiaa	I had a FS develop without any injury.  I had a severe reaction to the cortisone injection (cortisone flare) so I can't get them anymore.  It didn't help at all, obviously.  I've had it for 5 months and have opted for surgery (mua) in a few weeks.    Just try to keep your shoulder moving as best as you can, but sometimes a FS develops no matter how hard you try to prevent it.  There is a yahoo group for FS sufferers, it's very active, and I'm sure you could find a lot of experience and info there.  At the link below, cursor down to number 9, that's the biggest group with the most activity.|`|aMkLPOOeaa	had my shoulder done with cortisone injections. they help for a while but then it goes away and the pain comes back.  rotator cuff is screwed up. now the doctor gives me lortab for pain
LHzlvfRQaa	Go to a Chiropractor as they specialize in backs. They will assess what the problem is, and what treatment is required.  :-)))|`|F0d1bOxgaa	You probably injured or pulled a muscle in your back really bad. I'm sorry that it hurts that bad! It's actually happening to me right now except it is probably not that bad...I am around your age so...    The Advil will help hopefully! It sounds pretty bad and I wouldn't strain it. Try using your back and not completely demobilize it. See how it feels over night and then go from there. If it feels better you are probably doing ok.     Ask your parents for help or even your school nurse could be able to help. Just because you are young doesn't mean this isn't possible. Think if you might have done something before hand and then see if that if bending down may have made it worse.    Go dd luck and I hope you feel better. Tylenol and Ibuprofen also help. (I don't know how to spell the last medication! Lol)|`|9a109fd9f609de58a3f3ac49af195945aa	You may have popped a disk or something in your back by the sudden movement.  I suggest you tell your parents immediately so they can get you to a doctor ASAP!!
8OqdoIHtaa	Sure, yogurt with no added sugar. Danone has a good one, it only has 8 carbs.     Low fat cheese is good too. Cheddar doesn't have any carbs, at least the brand I use doesn't, and I use the low fat one, which is better for your heart.     There are some low carb ice creams available too, which we occasionally have for a treat.     Milk does have sugar in it, so I only use very small quanitities in my tea or coffee.  For cereal and shakes, and creamed soups, I use a soya milk product, which has NO sugar added and has only 3 carbs per cup.     (If you want to add soya milk to sauces or soups, don't boil it, because this can cause curdling. For soups I turn the temperature way down, and add it gradually, barely heating it,  just before serving. )    You can see the soya milk we use here...  http://www.sonice.ca/english/beverages_n...|`|pJ7icz0taa	You don't know much about diabetes and I suggest  you learn...Ask your Dr. for a diet sheet of what you are allowed on diabetes..they have cook books for that also  with sweets that you CAN eat.  Diabetes does NOT come from eating too much sugar  know that first.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	Not too much issues with dairy products.  Just read the labels and choose low carb varieties.  If you take insulin bolus for the carbs that you consume.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	For most of us, we cannot tolerate much dairy products at all without having to take an enormous amount of insulin to cover the "safe, low fat versions".    I can have a bit of full fat milk and can have all the cream I want. I cannot have any low fat yogurts or other low fat milk products. They will shoot my glucose level over 250 really really fast then crash again down to normals for me.    For me to have a normal serving of low fat yogurt is like eating 1/4 cup of sugar.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	cheese & milk|`|Vmz4woqgaa	Check out Dr. Schwarzbein's website  www.schwarzbeinprinciple.com    You owe it to yourself to get all the best information.

She is reversing type II diabetes in her endocrinology clinic thru diet alone.

Diet ice cream......................... the list goes on    Basically anything with low carbs or fat for daily standard intake.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	All of them!  Eggs, cheese, and cream all have virtually no carbs.  Milk is the only thing you have to watch because it does have 13g of carb per cup.  Just keep your carbs at the recommended level and you'll be fine.
551ZBzdLaa	I've had this before and in my experiences it's nothing to worry about. It's just like an ingrown zit type abscess. Since you've already popped some of the fluid out of it you could always try to once again after a few days. If it still hasn't' healed by then and is giving you problems you might want to get ahold of your doctor.

dcWN4v6Jaa	First going to the dentist isn't bad at all. I have been to the dentist for about 5-6 years already and I'm still going for check-ups,teeth cleaning, and etc. You have two cavities right. Here is what they do to fill the cavities. The gas is given to you with a mask.    1. They put you in a chair.  2. They might give you some kind of a gas to keep you from pain.  3. They make you sit there for 10 minutes and tell you to keep breathing through your nose.  4. Then they start numbing you (Novocain) my advise when they give you the Novocain is to breath fast and short breaths.  5. They start using some kind of tool to take out the rotted part.  6. They push in the filling (no pain)  7. You are all done!    There is no pain at all. When you leave you will still feel numb for a few hours. Don't worry!|`|ZtECjEPyaa	because of your teeth condition, i think you will have to get braces.|`|E0JXlG2Raa	Don't be afraid to go to the dentist, people over exaggerate when they talk about the dentist,  obviously there is a reason for everything in life it will make you look prettier too!

etmtgJ7maa	I'm going to answer the question yes but generally I would say it depends on things like:    -the size of the guys dick  -how relaxed, loose and wet you are  -how willing you are to receive him  -what's already been in your vag    Hope that helps, I'll answer more questions if you would like.|`|qu7DSLTqaa	I'm 4'10 and was about 95 pounds when I lost mine. He was not a samll guy (I'd guess about the top end of average). It wasn't very painful the first time (and got better after that). Make sure you use lube, it will help. For future reference (like say 10 years from now LOL!) I had 2 children--natural! Us little ones are tough!|`|dMBXw8Esaa	I'm tiny too, and it didn't hurt really. I mean it did, but not to the extent some people make it out to be. It's mostly just really uncomfortable; but it doesn't take long to get used to things. The other person was right; it really depends on the size of the guy's dick (but also your size down there too!) and how willing you are. If you're ready and comfortable with the guy and won't regret it, you'll be fine:)|`|Wi6tb3KDaa	Honestly i think it might just because since you are small, you would be even smaller "down there."  It would also depend on the size of his penis.  But as long as you're relaxed and have enough natural lube (or bottled lol) then it shouldn't hurt AS bad.  Just make sure that you're actually ready for it b/c you don't want your first time to be regretful.|`|oluzjSgjaa	some women from Asia are extremely small stature compared to say some African women.   so there are great varieties in size of vagina too.   but as already said above, depends on other factors too.   the stretching, tearing or breaking of the hymen is One factor     website below shows different types of hymen , if you want to see.........|`|I370yFWQaa	No, I wouldn't think so.

3977ddaa641eba89d5c341a64e316ab8aa	Yes, from what I've heard and experienced,    Diamond, triangle and wide-stance pushups work your chest.  There really aren't much difference between these except for the hands placement.    Also, pushup is a compound body weight exercise. Many trainers recommend compund exercises. Search them up on the web to know their benefits: compound vs isolation. It increases your strength so as your body strength ration to body weight is enough to lift yourself up.    And yes, resistance training add bulk. When you can easily overcome 8-10 reps/set of pushups with body weight alone:    - Add extra weight (e.g carrying a backpack with weights in it)  - Change your reps-set ratio (e.g 8rep/set for 4 sets, 5rep/set for 6 sets)  - Finish the set in lesser time  - Shorter rest time between sets    To finish this off, adding bulk to your body overall makes adding bulk to a particular spot easier.    Hope this helps.|`|PauslbY0aa	diamond/triangle pushups work your chest.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	No ..the best way is resistance training like use a bow flex home gym     Another is to use a row machine     but if you have neither Access to either one     i suggest you do chin ups because you will work youre pecs that way|`|64t8ynCyaa	Yes (self experience)

6SJ8QHKcaa	I was abused at 21 by my husband.  He's a police officer ... still!  I was young, dumb & naive.  I thought that for better or for worse meant that I had to take the abuse.  He saw my weaknesses, which were stupidity & insecurity and manipulated me with his mental & physical abuse.  After contemplating suicide, I went to him & told him that I was thinking about taking my life because I couldn't do anymore to try to make him happy.  He told me that whatever I did to not do it ... he said he didn't want to clean up the mess!     It was at that moment that I realized what a cold, heartless, person he was.  I also realized that this man really didn't care about me, so I thought maybe I should start caring enough about myself to GET OUT before he killed me.  So, I did.  I paid for my own divorce and got a new life.  Today ... I don't take the abuse ... from anyone.  I've learned that I should never settle for second best.  Why would anyone want to be treated less than what they are?  Why would you want to stay with someone that made you feel like you were less than nothing?  People who haven't been abused will never understand it until it starts happening to them.  Some people are very insecure, so they stay & make up excuses because they don't want to be alone or lonely.  I, for one, would rather be alone or lonely, as opposed to being beaten half to death!  Because my ex was, and still is, a police officer, he told me that if I ever told anyone that he would lie about it because he was the LAW and people would take HIS word over mine!  I don't think any kind of abuse is an "over reaction" ... people that tell you it is aren't very bright! God doesn't want His people to be treated like this, either, so why should anyone take it?  Bottom line?  They shouldn't!  Stand up & just say NO doesn't just apply to drug use ... it also applies to abuse!   Does this help?|`|gzaXHcweaa	because when you are being abused, the abuser always claims it will get better, and you believe and trust them, then they turn it on you so you think it is your fault.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	I wasn't abused as a child but I was in a verbally abusive marriage. My ex-husband used to back me into a wall and shout in my face whenever he would get upset for something I did or didn't do. It is a control issue. Men feel the need to control everyone and everything and if they can't they feel out of control. Once in the abusive situation every day goes by and we think maybe today will be better maybe that person will change but they never do then we force ourselves into believing that we can't do any better and the threats start or he starts to raise a hand to you but never actually strikes you. You leave me and I will find you and make your life miserable. Eventually the abused end up in a frail childlike state of mind where all they know is abuse so then it gets passed to their children. Abuse is physically and emotionally draining after exhaustion sets in so does psychosis. Psychosis sets in as a result of exhaustion and then the brain has to be retrained on how to think. The only way to recover from it is by counseling and being around positive people sometimes even changing your name and going into a witness protection program. The biggest part of all of it is Anger when we can't control our anger or loose control and don't check ourselves it can very easily turn abusive. I also had a friend that was abused by her bf and they are still together.|`|SA5DeRpUaa	thats really rude if someone said that.|`|WwCBomTMaa	I completely understand. My dad liked to call me filthy names (c***, bit**, worthless piece of s***, etc.) To me, being 25 and being abused by my dad was just humiliating. He just couldn't get over the fact that I was a grown up and he couldn't control me any more. Even though I was moved out and had a child of my own he still continued. When I finally started standing up for myself he became violent. A few months ago he hit me so hard it caused nerve damage in my face, and I still don't have complete feeling left in my nose and upper lip. He has always been mean to me, and I think that is why I didn't think anything of it when my ex started showing the same characteristics. That is why he is now my ex. I think it all stems down to the fact that the abuser convinces the abused that they are worthless and that nobody else will love them, and they also convince them that it is their fault. "Well, if you had just done what I told you to this wouldn't have happened." People that have never been abused before don't understand the feelings of self doubt, humiliation, and guilt that come with being abused. They think that we don't stand up for ourselves. I know some don't but I do stand up for myself. I am just convinced that one of these days he might kill me since I do stand up for myself. That is why in a few months I am moving to a different state, away from him. I am sorry if that has happened to you. Nobody should have to endure abuse.|`|AA10807022	I was in a relationship where the abuser was so subtle I didn't realize what was  happening until i was caught up in it. He was so good and it took me a very long time to get over it, 10 years. It affected even future relationships, it seemed like the abuse just stayed with me no matter what I did to try to help myself.  I think one of the reasons why I stayed in the relationship is because of the attention he gave me. Even though, he sexually and verbally abused me most of the time, the other times when he didn't I felt like he really cared about me. I liked the good attention he gave me but it wasn't enough and I got scared so I ended it.    But When I broke it off with him people didn't believe me when I said he abused me. They laughed at me and said yeah right, him? no way.    So I shut down inside because I felt like my friends thought I was lying. I felt like he stole my feminity and my self respect away. He made me feel like it was my fault for his abuse. I felt ugly and I wouldn't allow myself to look pretty. I wore unflattering clothes just so no man would notice me. I even gained weight just so I looked ugly.     It wasn't until I met a police officer that changed me for a little while. He told me I was not to blame for his behavior and I can truly become the woman I am destined to become. I started again trying to be beautiful but deep down inside I still felt ugly, so I faked trying to be pretty.I never believed anyone when they said i was pretty, I really thought they were lying or just trying to be nice even though they really thought I was ugly. My self esteem and confidence was non- existent. In many ways his abuse led to my own internal abuse. In many ways I let him continue to abuse me without him being in my life.     It wasn't until this past year that the affect really took its toll and  I started verbally abusing my boyfriend and my friends. I didn't even realize I was doing that! This abuse led to me break things off with the one man that sort off understood me! Talk about stupid but my ex boyfriend called me a boy and told me I was the ugliest girl he ever dated! It didn't hurt because I felt I deserved it after what I said to him. but then I thought maybe he was right!    I am finally starting over. Ive changed my hair, my clothes and my glasses, I started caring about myself and doing my make up And finally I am starting to see how pretty I really am.|`|3ZWBRRfsaa	Abuse is a very serious situation to handle.  In some cases you have to ride out an abusive situation until the right moment comes along to get out of it.  Although it can even be dangerous,  leaving it at the wrong time could be deadly.  There is also the disappointment that you feel towards the abuser if it is someone you love or care about.  In that case,  you may think things will get better because you want them to so badly.  Like you said,  most of the time it doesn't start out that way.  Someone who is abused craves the beginning before the abuse started and keeps hope that it will just go away.  The abuser keeps you confused by telling you what you want to hear,  crying,  apologizing or acting as if they feel sorry for what they've done.  In reality they are only making you weaker to keep you there.  Sometimes people get into abusive situations and just seem to continue the process.  Maybe they feel as if they don't deserve any better.  However,  that's not true at all.  Anyone who hasn't been abused in some kind of way will have a hard time understanding why a person stays in it.  They may not realize the delicate situation at hand.  If you are abused get out of the situation asap.  After wards,  make sure to take all precautions to protect yourself.  Even if it means moving or leaving town to hide out until everything calms down.      I'm sure you guessed already but I am speaking from experience.  I had a wonderful home life but dating and marriage proved that there are some really cruel and even dangerous people out there.  Always let someone know where you are and check in with someone daily.  I hope that you are not abused but if you are make a plan to take action while not putting yourself into more danger.  My heart goes out to you.|`|sOeMxfocaa	I have been there and I understand what you are going through, and I'm not sure why people what to be so insensitive. but I can tell you the reason I stayed as long did (10 years) because I just didn't believe in divorce then when my son was born my believe system was being second guessed, then when my ex wanted to go after my son that's when I left. different people have different stories. but that is what I tell people when the ask why did you stay so long. and you are right people who have never been in that kind of a situation they will never be able to understand what we have been through or why we stayed as long as we did.|`|JqvSEBIqaa	Dog, I don't like that name but I am going to answer you because this is right up my alley.  I am a woman, I am a grandmother and could be a great grandmother.  That gives you some idea of my age.  I am not just anybody.  My real name is not important, but yes I was abused as a child and as an adult.  As a child, my Mother abused all my sibblings and I.  She raised us in wrath, not with love.  She did not want kids and she had her first at 18.  She would always have a belt on the kitchen table or a switch from a tree or anything she could get her hands on to hit us with.  My Dad would beat my brothers with a radiator belt.  We lived on a farm where the neighbors did not know what was going on.  This was back in the 40's, 50's, and 60's.  We constantly got a bar of soap put in our mouth, our hair was pulled constantly, just about everyday we would come home from school.  I remember my hair coming out in clumps in my hands afterwards.  My hair got pulled so much that my scalp began to hemorage and it did it for 2 days.  My hairbrush was solid red with blood.  I was taken to the emergency ward the doctor told my mother that my scalp has come loose from my scull.  I was only 14 years old.  The doctor sent her out of the room and asked me what caused this.  I told him that if I told him I would get it worse when I got home.  He called her back in and told her to take me home and cut my hair a half inch all over my head. Another time I was taken to the emergency ward to see if my hymen was broken!!!!!!!! I was 17 and so humiliated by the whole ordeal that I could have crawled in a hole and never come out. Many times I had bruises all over my legs and back and would not undress to take showers in PE and was called on the carpet for it. It made my grades lower cause all I could think of in class is what was waiting for me at home when I got home from school.  I ran away from home when I was 12 and left home for good when I was 18.  I got pregnant and came back home asking for help and they didn't want me there anymore and so I left.  They moved out of state and did not tell me where or even give me their phone number.  I nearly commited suicide.  But I didn't.  The Lord kept me from doing a stupid thing like that. I was kicked out into the streets and fired from my job cause I was pregnant. My girl friend found me and took me to her house.   The father came back into my life and we married after the child was born.  From the beginning he started sitting in bars at night and not coming home.  He felt his life was still his own and he could do anything he wanted to whether I liked it or not.  He began beating me and giving me black eyes.  He beat me when I was 6 months pregnant and I had to be put in the hospital because I was loosing the baby little by little.  Needless to say the reason I stayed married to him for 24 years was because I still loved him and because there was no where to go and not money to get there and I had three kids by this time.  My first at 19 and 2 more by the time I was 23.  It really weighed me down.  He would not allow me to work outside the home and it was because he wanted me there with the kids all the time so he could do what he wanted to do.  I kicked him out when the last child was 18 and he filed for divorce to get me off the payroll because by this time he was making pretty good money and a living.  But he was the poorest example of a husband,he hadn't even wanted to touch me for the last 5 years. I am now married to the nicest man who loves me very much and has never hit me.  We have been married for 20 years. I believe I stayed with my marriage because I thought that was the way most people lived, and I thought that I did not deserve any better because I was constantly told I didn't.  Even years later when my husband and I bought our first home, I called my Mom up to tell her cause I was so excited and she said to me "What makes you think you deserve something more than me.  I haven't even got that yet".    But I found out it was all wrong and I came to realize that God had something better for me out there.   Just remember there still is hope.  It isn't always going to be that way.  I now believe it was a big test in my life and I believe HE is proud of me and that I have passed with flying colors.  He tells us that in all things give thanks for that is the will of God concerning your life.  Be strong, be good, love those who hate you and pray for them, they are lost.  Hope this has helped answer your question.
etxSRf3Raa	YES IT IS VERY NORMAL!   Like for me, I would fine one minute and be bitchy to my parents the next. Once, I cried because there was no rice. HAHA.

You should have thought about the consequences of your sexual activity at the time of your actions.  I do feel sorry for the child though who is going to have a father who does not want him/her.  Come on mate.  Consider the woman and discuss the situation.  See what she wants, what her fears are and why she appears reluctant.  Maybe you can then either understand her position or maybe she will see your point.  Abortion is not just a quick fix.  It plays havoc with the emotions of the person especially when she does not want to.  remember for you it is ending a possible problem for her it might be feeling like murder.  I think a valid argument for people who are against it.  Please consider her feelings.    Just thought about something else.  Maybe you should ask your wife what she thinks about this.  Ask her whether she thinks your mistress should abort the baby or not.|`|47R03TbFaa	NO YOU CAN'T MAKE HER GET AN ABORTION .

LQABiZcaaa	I assume you are refering to the ablative treatment (destroy any remaining thyroid/turmor tissue).   She will get a lot of information on dealing with the 3 to 5 days after treatment where she will need to avoid contact with other people.  the person who is assisting in her care should also attend.  Good questions to ask are about dealing with possible side affects (e.g. painful saliva glands) and other possible side affects.   She is probably feeling lousy right now having been off the tyroid medicane for several weeks.   So questions about when she can again start the thyroid meds again.|`|AA11605300	Tell her to ask how successful the iodine treatment is expected to be, When can she get pregnant, will she need to be on meds for the rest of her life, how long must she stay away from giving oral sex and holding children near her neck.

Try massaging with lotion, or topical ointments with ketoprofen as an active ingredient for mild pain relief.    If it feels more like joint pain, then it might be a spinal disc issue -- get it checked out by a professional, that stuff is serious!
0PpQxZ62aa	It takes -3500 calories to loose a pound, which means you need to both burn calories by working out & take less calories in by eating in order to loose weight.    Eat fruits & veggies of course. It's typical to eat a small breakfast and a big dinner, but my health teacher said you actually want to do the opposite. And never skip breakfast, it helps you loose weight. I stopped driking pop and lost 50 pounds in 1 year!! Don't drink juice. You'd think fruit juice is good for you, but its not. It has alot of sugar and extra calories. People say dont eat carbs' not true, 60% of your diet is suposed to be from some type of carbs... just make sure you eat whole grain or whole wheat bread. And drink only skim milk, all others arent so great for you. Just watch what you eat and pay attention to nutrition labels!    Work out at least 3-5 days a week for at least an hour a day. Make sure you do some weight bearing activities along with cardio, it'll help build muscle and burn fat! If you cant buy a gym membership try going for a walk or run ourside, doing jumping jacks, jump rope, running up & down your stairs, lifting weights, doings situps & pushups.. those are just some ideas that'll help! Make sure you give your muscles some time to rest though too!|`|KppM3VzAaa	Get your weight in kgs. Multiply your kgs x 1.56, this will tell you the amount of protein in grammes you should be eating per day.    Also find out how many calories you burn (RMR -resting metabollic rate, men ave 2000 cals/day, women 1500).    Then eat the right amount of protein, reduce your calorie intake 500 below your RMR and research shows you will lose 2lbs of FAT per week.    Best to eat 4 - 6 small meals per day and do exercise too.      You need to be having simple carbs (fruit smoothie, banana etc) before going to the gym to kick start the fat burning process, then a protein shake within 30 mins after finishing|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Eat healthy, reduce the amount of "junk" food you eat, and eat more filling meals, reducing the amount of snacks you eat between meals.    Exercise any time of the day. Make sure you don't exercise right after you eat (I think there's a rule about waiting 30 mins after eating).     Try to start an exercise routine: ie. exercise 30 mins before you can watch television for the day or smth that will give you a reason to exercise. It's also a good idea that when you're watching tv, do some exercise (ie sit ups, push ups, lifting small barbells) things like that.    Stick to your routine and you should lose weight. It will take a while, but you'll get there if you are consistent and don't put it off.|`|eBUYwjXCaa	well it's different for everyone.

Drink lots of water to stay filled up on. All of these tips will help if you do them.|`|FYUHJyvpaa	Some people have expressed reluctance to engage in sports, precisely because there is a requirement to run a number of miles for a while, but otherwise will not be any good. It is not true. You just need to become much more active in your daily life. It is much more realistic, more feasible and therefore more effective. But is it? To begin with - yes.

In other words, your symptoms are caused by a ghost. Those who suffer from such symptoms are the saints spoken of in the scriptures, and the spirit involved is the so-called Holy Spirit.    The reason you suffer from motion sickness is that when the spirit moves it affects your sense of equilibrium. By realizing that a spirit is the cause, most of your symptoms should become a thing of the past.    I would recommend that you talk to it. How one talks to oneself, in the mind, is how one speaks with a spirit. Start by thinking, " hello, are you there?" You will hear its response in your mind as if you thought them. This phenomena is called telepathy and is how spirits communicate. It is also how God hears our prayers.

My brother is into the fitness lifestyle and I checked on all of his expensive protein shakes. All of them (the expensive to very expensive) ones have nothing but dried eggs in them. And to top it all of they usually contain synthentic chemicals to give faux energy or to add color or flavor.    My suggestion is take a Magnesium tablet daily (minimum 400mg) for absorption and all the other benefits from it (see" The Miracle of Magnesium") like muscle function. On top of this I recommend Eggs, turkey or Chicken for the protein.    Don't buy into the industry propaganda of the "shakes."

WwCBomTMaa	I've had them before. If you are referring to a charlie horse, you need more potassium in your diet. Try eating more bananas or taking a supplement.
AA11176387	well I do not want to scare this but this does happen sometimes but it is very rare.    I know this happens because it happened to me when I had a c section 30 years ago (apparently the anesthesiologist did not give me enough and I was unable to move to tell anyone but I was in and out of pain not continuous and I did hear my baby's first cry and the doctor saying it's a boy..I tried to tell them I was awake the second I could speak as they were wheeling me out of surgery but no one believed me..they kept saying I was not supposed to wake up so quick too so I must have not been under to the depth they thought.      Noone ever talked to me about it (probably scared of lawsuits) but I watched that movie Awake.. with great interest but my experience was more fleeting in and out pain rather than total continuous awareness but I did feel it, it hurt bad,  and tried hard to move my finger and couldn't..generally this rarely happens..you have more chance I would guess of being hit in a wreck on the way over there.    I will not go into more details cause  I don't want to scare you but I have had surgeries since and it never happened again.    I looked it up as your question made me think about it and the prevailing suggestion is to talk to the patient as it says most cases reported are true and if the staff denies it it can worsen psychological problems..I found they are collecting experiences at one site when I just looked and I might put my experience in there    For you. meeting with the anesthesiologist and telling them your fears beforehand will let them be aware you want to be carefully monitored throughout the surgery and they will reassure you I am sure.    Although the true incidence of the frequency is not known as some do not report it or are listened to, but it is said to be about one in 500 cases or 40,000 a year of the millions of surgeries performed.      Of these "awakenings" most feel no pain, some feel pressure and only a few have pain and long extended incidences of consciousness  as portrayed in the movie..most are hazy and fleeting like mine but I did feel real bad pain but it did not last long as in and out of awareness, but the memory of it is clear to this day (after all I was giving birth and we always remember that well)    So your odds are very small the scenario you are playing up in your mind will happen..very small Also my experience happened a long time ago and I am sure they are more aware of the problem now and taking better steps to prevent it.      It is called anesthesia awareness and several sites sprung up seeking more knowledge of this and of incidences to better address the problem and help prevent it.    I can say with almost certainly that you will not experience this..generally you count backwards from 100 and are out before you reach 90 .  You remember NOTHING and feel nothing while unconscious.  You wake up and for a minute cannot figure out where you are and then you remember you had surgery and the nurses usually come over to attend to you    I am almost certain you will not have any problems..I had several surgeries with zero problem with anesthesia.    If you are in pain they will give you pain meds that help a lot.    For anxiety take some kava kava (take about 60 drops of organic tincture (herbpharm is a good brand) minutes before  they tell you to not drink or eat anymore so as to not interfere with the fasting required for surgery.    Spray 2 squirts of rescue remedy on the tongue just before going to surgery to clam you down and deep breathe. It is such a minute amount, contains nothing harmful as it is homeopathic and it will not affect the surgery requirements as it is so minute but you can omit it if you feel afraid to do.    If you are scared..to calm down  pick a spot in the room toi stare at and do Lamaze breathing like puff puff blow puff puff blow ..this also helps with painful procedures or if you can't figure that out from my description just slow deep breathe and focus on staring at one spot..deep breathing calms you down.      I am always sure to pray before surgery, get right with God,  and tell my loved ones I love them in the rare event anything happens.  You will get through this I promise..think positively too as this will help    I suggest talking with your doctor about this and asking if they can give you something to calm you down in your iv..I am pretty sure they can and to arrange a meeting with you and the anesthesiologist to be aware of your concerns,    Also take lots of antioxidants before and after surgery for better healing (example of these are pycnogenol or grape seed extract (best sources), vit c, vit e, selenium and/or coq 10    Best of luck...|`|8VtNGFjAaa	I have had 4 surgeries in the past 4 yrs.  They give you an IV, then a mask over ur face to make you fall asleep.  When they gave me mask over my face each time, my head started to feel full and weird, then I was out.  Then all the sudden I woke up and surgery was over.  Felt like I only slept for 10 min.  I was afraid at first too, but now I'm used to it.  My surgeries were for getting my tubes tied, hernia etc. common procedures.  Good luck. You will be fine.  They will walk you thru it too and make sure you feel comfortable.|`|Ms72jNbBaa	I've had a whole bunch of surgeries, and I've been so knocked out I couldn't actually FEEL it!  Anesthesiologists know their stuff and can really fine-tune the degree of brain-sleep.  My body may have had awareness on some level, but the pain didn't register as anything I needed to feel threatened about.  Of course some others may have a different experience.    Depending on what the surgery is for, it might be the lesser of two evils to go under the knife.  If there is another way to gain the same benefit, then you might consider doing that instead.    Best wishes!  We have to trust some of the people some of the time!|`|a7d989288d93495fbc7bb1f37065ca45aa	i've had few surgeries in my lifetime at a young age like 9 or 10 from a car accident. all i can tell you is that i didn't wake up during operations and when i did after it was done, i felt no pain as much as i can remember.     just a few years i had metal pins inserted into my feet but even after the operation i could still feel the drowsiness.     don't worry, everything will be ok. you're in my prayers.|`|mp1MfFMraa	It can be pretty scaried.

Yes, you can still feel the knife moving around, but it isn't as bad as being fully awake.|`|3208995a056e331b2cc1bc88d9590058aa	i went under about 2 months ago. im now almost fully recovered. i was a little worried about it before too, but i generally don't worry so i didn't make a big deal of it. its one of the easiest things you'll ever have to do. lol really. they'll put the iv in you which hurts a little, and the next thing you know you'll be waking up. and you'll wake up in a happy state because you'll still be feeling  the effects of the anesthesia. the anesthesia might make you say things that you wish you didn't, well it did for me but other than that there is really nothing to worry about    good luck...|`|F566iruqaa	no you cant feel anything. don't be scared. its actually kind of cool i think. it knocks u out and it only feels like u went asleep for a few minutes and then woke back up. u wont remember anything. waking up is the woworstho because it might make u sick or make u feel like ur going to be sick.

Good luck & God bless.|`|db4b4aa8deeae52ad9947eec755b5f73aa	This problem can be somewhat remedied with more frequent excercise.    I'm talking about strenuous excercises, you know, stuff  that really requires concentration / dedication. Then again, if you are a 12 y/o girl, i would rather suggest that you play sports more.. weight training is really, for adults.    If you find yourself easily distracted then you may also find it goood to practise some sort of meditation technique. Force yourself to sit still for 5 minutes, lower your breath-rate, relax, plan out the rest of your day in your head.... then go and continue your day, according to plan.|`|q6sRSLI1aa	I, honestly, do not believe in the whole concept of A.D.D. I am scatterbrained. The things that you stated in your question are some of the qualities that I have. If you had "A.D.D" (Which, to me, stands for Another.Dead-wrong.Diagnosis), then you would have been diagnosed with it at a young age. Don't feel bad, a lot of people share the same things that you do and we are not all suffering from A.D.D.|`|F6FXBXPNaa	You know its so sad that this ADD has hit us the way it has.  I think this disorder is thrown around waaaaay too loosely.  I feel strongly that you don't need a diagnosis you just need to work a little harder than the rest of us.  When I lived in California, they were trying to tell me that my son had ADD and was trying to tell me that he needed medication.  I have since moved to Washington where I am devoting a little more time toward his school study and he is now a B student!!! What I am trying to say is that you can do it...just take the extra steps even if it means tutoring or just a different way of learning the subject.  It can be done...please believe me because I have experienced it!!!!!!|`|7PESDiOqaa	Well I'm easily distracted too, my friends tell me that I have ADD so I just take their word for it|`|ACyl5uQMaa	Attention Deficit Disorder is as a chemical imbalance, not just a simple scatterbrain issue. We all go through the day with jumping from one thing to the other? why? because we enjoy lots of different things! You enjoy news articles, you like checking your email and lots of things just pop into your head and witht he internet, it is all accessible at once so you probably just do it!    I am a bit scatterbrain as well, especially when I am with friends and start jumping around talking about video games and what not. You would have known by now if you were A.D.D diagnosed, since those who truly have the illness will tell you about the diffilcuty of it, but it cn be controlled especially when we get older.    I hope this has helped but when in doubt, seek medical advice from a doctor!|`|8k9bHjyyaa	The first answerer is not necessarily correct.  There are different forms of ADD, the one the first person is referring to is the version that you do find early in life.  From what you are describing you could be a candidate for ADD.     I live with the same problem and the best thing to do is to make sure to have a schedule/agenda and write down important things to do and things like that. Its hard to not get distracted away from other things.    Good luck,  I wish you well.

Q4ggnG0waa	It's not very common in US.  It is different in humans than it is in dogs. In some people, it will make them very, very sick. I knew a woman who was almost dead she was so sick. Losing massive amount of weight, puking, etc. Drs were stumped until they accidentally found a tapeworm. There are several different types of tapeworms and some actually cause no problems at all.    Since tapeworms can only be ingested through fleas, it probably won't be found in any kind of meats.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Believe it or not, tapeworms used to be sold in catalogs to help weight control and weight loss.    That's right!  You actually swallowed them when they arrived in their nice little glass jar.    They are very easy to get rid of.  You just need the right pill.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	nope. its estimated that 1 in 3 people on the earth have intestinal parasites, there are different kinds though.|`|BN4Gkjvcaa	In foreign countries they are VERY common.     If you ever go out barefoot or swimming in a lake.  you might get a parasite.  Or if you ever eat raw meat.      Not so much in civilized countries.|`|tK1Y7u2Gaa	Nope!|`|4BoteYDwaa	Pretty common, but they can be treated fairly easily.    Talk to a doctor if you suspect that your infected. If you've got a tapeworm in your gut, quinacrine hydrochloride (Atabrine) or niclosamide will kill it. If you've got a tapeworm embryo anywhere else in your body, however, two drugs -- praziquantel and albendazole -- are available.    There are a few steps you can take to avoid tapeworm infestation. Steer clear of undercooked meat -- heat kills the worms. Wash your hands after you use the toilet. Never drink water that might be contaminated with the worm or any of its cousins.

Volunteer at a soup kitchen then things might not seem so bad. It is the good qualities about a person that makes them good not what people say about how you look. Be positive. You are only upset because it is a new beginning for you. You don't know anyone, afraid people might make fun of you because of your acne and you put on a few pounds.

I guess from your answer that you are a teenager and many people have told you it's perfectly normal to feel up, down and a whole load of emotions for no apparent reason. However if your unhappiness is persisting and your motivation to do stuff you used to enjoy like running has evaporated then I guess it is time to talk to someone about how you feel. Start with old friends back home and your mom and dad if you can - if you still feel unhappy then go to your doctor! In the meantime are there any clubs or societies you can join in your new school as a way to meet people? Good luck and take care.
YDykVkcmaa	This question is impossible to answer - sorry.    The dosage would depend upon a wide array of factors but the first would be 'It depends upon what is causing the low testosterone', what your current t-levels are, what are the chances they could supply a dose that may kick-start your own t production, what are you attempting to achieve with your t-supplementation, etc., etc.    If you are just suffering from low-t then about 1 - 2mls of 5% AndroMen t-cream a day could do the trick - do the math because your dose could change based upon skin absorption rates, concentration of the cream, will you have injections instead or maybe an implant. The doc may simply prescribe exercise, stop smoking and change your diet.

Thats what the dr. told her to do.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Your period does not go by the date on the calendar.  If you had a period on Jan. 2 and have a 26 day cycle, you would have another on Jan. 28, so yes you can easily have two in one month.  In fact, if you are on a 28 day cycle, you will usually have 13 per year, every year.    hope this helps..

4WzPs7Rlaa	Hi Yao,    You obviously seem very worried and anxious about this as you have asked a lot of questions about being diagnosed with bipolar, and being forced to take medicine. I'm from the UK and the only way professionals can make people take medicine without their consent is if they are sectioned under the Mental Health Act. This will only happen if you are deemed to be significantly at risk to yourself or others. This is not an easy process and will not happen unless it is absolutely necessary. Doctors and other professionals will be involved in this process and will need to deem it the last resort.     I suggest you get some information from your gp if you are diagnosed with bipolar, as you (hopefully!) will want to take the medication because it helps you cope with your illness. Bipolar medications are generally grouped as 'mood stabilisers' and they do exactly that, they help to stop extreme highs and lows in your mood.     I hope everything works out for you x|`|uJKTR4d2aa	There is no court order that would force someone to take medication unless they were put into a psychiatric hospital. Any other things done outside the psych hospital dont force medication upon patients for any reason what so ever. We have the power of choice.      I am in the USA, but these laws are pretty much through out the world im sure. You really think they are going to assign someone a police officer to watch every morning or night for the rest of his life to see if the person takes the meds?
2vrnakJDaa	They're destroying their lives.  Don't get involved.    Try to make good decisions with your childhood, it pays off when you get older. Fool around now and you'll end up with horrible problems in the future.|`|OWGA6cFKaa	Cigarettes or Weed?|`|vn0DHMXWaa	It is perfectly normal that kids your age smoke. Ever since the cigarette was invented, kids your age and even younger have been smoking them. It is not big deal.  At least try a few yourself, and let people see you smoking after you get good at it. Then if you don't want to continue, tell everyone you have quit smoking. That way you can be cool and smart at the same time, and life is good.|`|h8l1H4N4aa	it's the age that most kids try it.  Look close tho -- how many are actually inhaling?  They look ridiculous.  Too bad, tho, to think that a lot of them are gonna get hooked before they know it.  (Unfortunately, I was one of them a long time ago and lost count of how many times I tried to quit.)  Good for you and your friends.  Don't cave, ever.|`|SU8z0TUoaa	People wouldn't smoke if they didn't enjoy it. It is actually quite an enjoyable and pleasant activity, although it does take a slight amount of getting used to. And understand that it isn't that people who smoke think that they LOOK cool - smoking actually makes you feel cool, and if you feel cool, then you are cool!  So, go ahead and try it for yourself. I know that some tiny part of you wants to, and that is okay - perfectly normal. Do it alone, so that you are doing it for yourself, and not for how others see you. Try a few puffs without inhaling, then take a small puff and inhale it - as you inhale, when you feel like coughing, just stop inhaling and hold your breath, trying hard not to cough. When the feeling passes, exhale and do it again. In just a few puffs, you will be able to inhale without coughing, and then you can truly know what it is like.  Remember, smoking is as close as you can get to having sex with your lungs!
IW4z58Zvaa	Try some herbal alternatives - At times, they tend to compliment or work better than medication.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	Yes, mine works for me (Vyvanse) but this is not the first one I have been on. Not every medication works for everyone. If you've been on it for a decent amount of time then talk to your doctor about some other options. I took straterra - didn't work for me - but I know people who it has worked for. And I have a good friend who was on concerta for a year and got switched to adderall -- she went from getting kicked out of college to a honor student while holding a full time job. Don't give up so easily. There are meds that work. You just have to be patient because it is very much a trial-and-error process.|`|fF61Xa6Waa	i have add, and i feel more focused it works for me! best wishes for you!|`|qHyOCptDaa	It completely depends.  I took Concerta, and it was horrible - I dropped 15 pounds and was constantly nervous and agitated.  I switched to Strattera, but I don't really believe that it's doing anything for me either, mostly because I can't tell the difference when I'm on it than when i'm off, although people around me (family) say taht they can tell the difference when I'm on medication.  It's eventually gotten to the point where I don't even bother taking it anymore.    ADD medicine is a pain in the butt. :\  Nothing seems to work, and the irony is that although people tell me the medicine works, I can never remember to take it BECAUSE I have ADD.  Haha.

rR4PtPuUaa	Foods or vitamins won't improve your nearsightedness,they just help the health of you retina (which is an extremely important part of the eye, but has nothing to do with nearsightedness)   The reason why your eyesight got worse is that nobody told you that you had to take the glasses off for close-up activities. Nearsighted people are able to see close things much better and more easily than people with perfect eyesight and that's why glasses should be taken off.. When you use your current glasses for reading books, computer,etc., you strain your eyes and help your vision to get worse.  Unfortunately your nearsightedness is now too high and you can't do anything without glasses. You might read without glasses but your eyes would have to be extremely close to the book and that would be harmful. There is however one thing you can do to avoid further worsening : use undercorrections for near work (undercorrections means weaker glasses, and you probably have old glasses that are weaker than your current ones) . That way you'll reduce  eye strain (overaccomodation, to be exact) and your nearsightedness will slow down or stop. Glasses are usually prescribed strong enough to make you perfectly see things that are far away, but nobody stares at the sky all day long. and that's why nearsightedness gets worse.  Even with undercorrections always remember to stay as distant as possible from what you are looking at , because it's the short distance that causes the eye to become nearsighted. Full prescription glasses can make it much worse, but they are not  the sole responsible.|`|im0OsH78aa	Ask the doctor if he recommends less strong glasses for reading or try one of your old pairs for near work.|`|BOaaKdViaa	Eating any certain kind of foods or vitamins will NOT improve or protect your eyesight from nearsightedness. Those eye vitamins that you see in the stores are basically just a multivitamin with extra lutein that helps delay macualr degeneration in old people.   Most people's nearsightedness only goes up to -10, however there are those that can go much higher, the highest I have seen was -20.   Your eyesight will probably become stable when you finish school and are around 19 or 20. That is when most people's eyes stop growing and changing large degrees. You vision will not improve over time. Sorry, it will most likely stay the same or change very little until you are around 40, where most people start losing their near vision. Then in your 60's you will probably develop cataracts.  Nothing can protect your vision from worsening, sorry, it's genetics!|`|un0C52G8aa	Since you're still in high school, your prescription probably won't get much worse. It should become relatively stable by the time you reach your twenties. As for improving over time, I don't know if it does. Mine never got any better as I got older. I remember being told when I was a child that when I reached my 40s, my prescription would lessen because of the onset of presbyopia. Now that I'm there, I can say my prescription is still as bad as it ever was.|`|A6GRX4wAaa	There's nothing you can really do to improve your vision except lasik surgery. The best thing you can do is always to wear sunglasses and continue to keep getting your eyes checked yearly and getting your eyeglasses updated.   Most people are under a -10.00, but there are people that can go much higher.  You will probably stay stable for alittle while since you are in high school your vision might worsen slightly over the years, but for the most part your eyes are probably done with worsening.|`|f2824c0ffab42869900d5ccd3ca8501eaa	Check out what the AOA (American Optometric Association) has to say.

Don't worry about getting braces though, it doesn't hurt or anything. :]|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	No, they put bands around them. I have braces. Also here is what you need to know about braces.    WEBSITES  1. http://kidshealth.org/kid/grow/body_stuf...  2. http://www.bracesinfo.com/  3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_brac...  4. http://www.archwired.com/First_Day_in_Br...  5. http://www.greatsmiles.net/foods/foods.h...     PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.     DON"T'S  1, Don't eat hard foods.  2. Don't chew gum.  3. Don't stress over it.     FOODS YOU CANNOT EAT  1. popcorn  2. gum  3. carmel  4. apple (whole)  5. Ice  6.nuts  7. peanut brittle  8.hard pizza crust  9. corn on cob  10. ribs  11. chips  12. hard pretzels  13. hard rolls and bagels  14. raw carrots  15. beef jerky  16. corn nuts   17. suckers     2.Before they put in the bands you need spacers. They feel like stuff stuck in your teeth. My braces costed about $5,500. That included retainer,putting on braces,spacers,bands,taking off braces,etc. I didn't have headgear if you need headgear then it should be about $10,000. (My friend has headgear). Hoped I helped.

DxkwjYTYaa	it dose run in families so yes go get it cheeked out only takes a short time and a bit of blood and stop trying to be your own doctor go to a real one|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Kriisten,   I know how you feel. My little sister, 7, has diabetes. My parents had thought she might have it. And she does. I started to wonder if i had it as well, but my mom said i didn't have the symptoms. If you were diabetic you'd constantly be very hungry & very thirsty. But you wouldn't gain weight, you'd lose it. You'd also wet the bed. The only other diabetic is a 2nd cousin.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	If you had diabetes, your parents would notice. You'd be SICK. There's a lot more going on that just being thirsty and hungry (which are natural feelings).  The genetic link is not strong enough to warrant random testing of everyone who has a relationship to your grandmother's grandmother.  If this was your brother or sister instead of a cousin, then I'd be more concerned.  My son has diabetes, none of his cousins do.  As a matter of fact, no one else in my extended family does.  Type 1 diabetes (which is what a 5 year old has) is a autoimmune disorder.
AA11886165	It seems that the "girls" who answered you so far care more about penises than about the man they are with. If the girl cares that much about the pigmentation of your skin, who needs her?|`|LlEr2OdBaa	No girl should care if you are enough to her that she is seeing that area then she wont care. it isn't a contagious condition so she should have no worries.|`|bjN4eaqUaa	Try to  cure this, I recently hear about psoralens substance that is very useful for vitiligo.|`|sEQfufckaa	Of course girls will care.

WwCBomTMaa	This happened to me when I was pregnant. They tested me for anemia and sure enough......You might want to go to your doctor and get your blood iron levels tested. Also, sometimes I've heard if the air is really dry it can cause nose bleeds.|`|NWazPeE0aa	Ehh.. Fluke nothing serious.. I get random nosebleeds a lot.! (Atleast once every 3 weeks) My professor told me It was nothing to worry about.|`|qXCgeye3aa	do you do cocaine??|`|5bb013e7455bc352bf3e92e885bba51daa	Well when I am on my period I always seem to get nose bleeds. But if it is a constant problem that really annoys you, I would go to your doctor and maybe get some blood test if you want to or you could have it cauderized. This usually stops nose bleeds from reoccuring. Also, I live in Colorado where it is very dry and my doctor told me to use Nasal Saline Spray at night and in the morning and also before I go to bed to put some vasaline on the middle part on the iside of my nose (septum of my nose).
F0d1bOxgaa	I can understand how you feel. Know that it will go away and that it is only for a second. Stare at something, talk to someone, and maybe even think of something happy like who you like or something that you enjoy.     Also, if you give blood don't sit in one of the "chairs" lay on the couch just in case you get freaked out...The person who draws the blood usually is very careful and knows you may be afraid of needles.     Tell them before hand that you are scared of them and they will understand. If they count before they give me a shot it helps. I usually am in a daze when they do it because I am scared so see if that helps.     You may want your mom\dad or whoever is with you to hold your hand and squeeze it when you are scared. It helps a lot. Laugh through the tears too!     Good luck!|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	close your eyes as soon as they walk into the room with the needle and explain you prefer to not see what they are doing and not know when they are about to stab you.|`|TORBP6QIaa	I used to be the same as you and often would faint if I had to get a needle.      Somehow oneday you just have to try be brave and if you have a good nurse/doctor who is gentle and good at getting the needle into the vein you will realise it doesnt actually hurt, its more like a little scratch.  It hurts more if you are scared and tense.  When you tense up your muscles are tight and that makes it harder to get the needle in.    Now I find blood tests are really easy. I find regular needles to sting alot more than a blood test.|`|WwCBomTMaa	I use to throw up immediately after the needle left my arm. Just tell the doctor that you don't want to know what they are doing. Focus your attention on someone or something else and pretend that they aren't there. And tell them not to tell you when they are going to insert it.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Don't look and concentrate on something else, talk to someone else in the room.  The pain goes by faster if you are still.  Also, when it does 'stick' instead of carrying on, try to make yourself laugh  even if tears come out.  It helps.|`|611dee8243ba39b3fdc80516025c988caa	I hate needles and I have gave blood to the American Red Cross. I did it because it was the right thing to do. I just looked away from the needle took a deep breath and said I am not going to cry
0lG71HNIaa	the best answer i could give you is to brush your tounge and the insides of your cheek, you can have plaque build up there which causes bad breath. try getting a tounge scraper they really work =)    as far as acid reflux, getting on some otc meds or a RX might help a lot. its worth a try.     chewing parsley? i have no idea sorry...    tooth paste with fluoride is better than toothpaste w/o fluoride because fluoride aids in the remineralization of your teeth helping to keep away cavities.|`|pDqsFgjyaa	Try to drink more fluids each day, being dehydrated/slightly dehydrated causes bad breath. You could use mouth sprays/listerine strips too.|`|E0JXlG2Raa	brush your tongue, and use mouthwash

AA10144532	When it gets out of your system you will be fine but it will take time for your natural "clock" to get back in sync. Adderall is an amphetamine salt and if you have no diagnosed reason to take it then you should leave it alone. It has side effect of sleeplessness and lowering appetite because it works like speed and will show on a urine test as does speed. Do not take it again and give your body time to readjust.|`|vjmXiIfnaa	If you overdosed you would be dead instead of writing on here. No, you didn't overdose.|`|Elxuvon8aa	ya you are playing with your life taking meds that were not prescribed for you. You are lucky you are still alive do not ever do it again See a doctor and get what is right for you. Never Share scripts.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Your response is normal. Adderall is a strong amphetamine, and that's what amphetamines do to people who are not ADHD.    If you can't sleep within another day or two, you'll have to suck it up and go to a doctor or nurse.    Have you learned your lesson now? lol...|`|vVmsJRTbaa	you'll get over it.. there are 40mg adderalls so it's not like you actually overdosed. don't be so stupid next time.

7zBbm8C8aa	ice and elevate
MA5Jspdqaa	Well, if you can afford it, then yes, I think you do. If you want a perfect smile that is. There's also Invisalign I think it's called. Google it, it's an alternative to braces. Also cheaper I think.     You might also want to try to whiten your teeth. There's a bunch of products out there now adays. That also improves a smile :)|`|Vs9Zs31uaa	I don't think you need braces but i suggest yu put them on now because you will be thankful when your older and your teeth are perfectly straight|`|eCngkejDaa	    It all depends on whether you are placing your front row naturally in front of your bottom row. If you can (without pain) I suggest you go see your orthodontist and see what he can do. Judging by your pictures, I think you won't have them for a long time, but be prepared. I am loving the fact that I had braces, since I have very pretty teeth now. If you have any more questions, I can give you more detailed, professional help at enounciate@live.com.
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Such a large area requires a visit to the Dr...ASAP!!!!!!|`|CJvJVNbdaa	"ring worm" is caused by a fungus which responds well to sulfa products if she isn't allergic try to find a soap with sulfa or selenium for her to wash with.|`|5bb013e7455bc352bf3e92e885bba51daa	A kid at school on the wrestling team (they get ringworm alot) mentioned washing the area with bleach to kill the bacteria
cK8TnRHRaa	At 13, don't expect much. It can be very difficult to put on weight when you're young because your metabolism is very high.    However, if you want to try then you'll need supplements. You need to consume A LOT of calories and you don't want them coming from fat or unhealthy foods. Pick up some weight gainer that contains whey protein. Hit the gym every day and follow up with a high-calorie protein shake. Building mass (without fat) is pretty simple. You work out, tearing your muscles then consume lots of protein to build the muscle back up. Over time you'll gain shape. Give yourself about three months before expecting results.    Don't worry about getting "too big". If you get to a point you're happy with then simply cut back (but don't stop) working out so that you maintain your size.
tSZMBTOIaa	I think the best way for that would be to start swimming.  Need your lungs alot for that and it's good exercise
ZyGJhdNtaa	its called web md|`|tSZMBTOIaa	Ok lets look at this, you've grown an inch put on 30 pounds,but don't notice any extra fat. Is the 202 total with the extra 30 pounds.Either your on steroids or you have hit a growth spurt. Do you exercise? Have your eating habits changed,is there any changes in your health,your not pregnant right.    Sometimes young girls just put on weight you know get that extra hip spread for having kids.Just keep an eye on what you eat stay active and keep in tune on how your body feels physically like beeing tired more,having trouble breathing things like that.    And if you are still upset with this outcome you are facing, just make an appt. to go see your doc to ease your mind ok.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	your head might explode like a bloated heated bag of blood.|`|ucr4J8kcaa	It depends how to gained the weight really. 30 lbs is a LOT to gain in such a short amount of time and you should probably discuss it with your doctor. Did you just eat a lot?|`|WG4zNIlTaa	Well it is  a good thing if per chance you get stranded in the wilderness tomorrow|`|YVd79cbraa	you could just be goin through a growth spurt.  and if you've been working out it could just be muscles.  but that is a lot for just muscles.  if you feel worried about it, it never hurts to get checked out.|`|0VzZpCRxaa	yes your in risk. watch the movie supersize me|`|7b360b8c3b7d104a9aa0913a1859d4e4aa	If you're not having any physical symptoms right now, probably nothing.

Dude you're young play sports, join the cross country team at school do something to stay in shape.  I'm not going to tell you to watch what you eat just eat things within moderation and get some exercise.  It's a good time for you to start weight lifting too.|`|6LtmIxhCaa	My guess is you're growing like a teenager should. You're going through puberty and this is completely normal. If you don't notice any new fat or anything that looks bad then don't worry about it. Your body is taking it's course and is doing what it is suppose to. If this continues to happen for a couple of month more than your health will be at risk. You are completely fine right now.     www.myspace.com/thebestjoshhartevermad...
t5z0pdBSaa	I'm thinking you need braces. Dentists always want to be on the safe side so he/she'll want braces on you. Sorry, it seems like you really don't want them. But it's alright :D. You learn to live with it. Take it from someone has had them.|`|mQ5v9KUWaa	Yeah that would be best checked out. If it starts to cause any pain or discomfort then go to the orthodontist and quick. But otherwise if you don't think it is too serious then... I guess it isn't.

XL9CUrp2aa	instead of sandwiches for lunch have a salad or use whole wheat bread on your sandwiches,  eat fruit instead of chips and low sugar juices and water instead of soda and youll lose weight really nicely and healthy|`|qcB23QvZaa	no an 11 year old boy should not be thinking about that|`|Lgm0p00jaa	oh no no no no no no no....      you have  NOOOOOOO extra baggage.....  if ur REALLY athletic u would have no "extra baggage"    think about that skinny mick|`|kbLHHXyuaa	Man, your young, that's not too bad! But, if you insist, cut down on the Double Quarter Pounder's, Snickers, and Mountain Dew. If you actually are athletic, I would assume that you do plenty of aerobic activities. It is recommended to get at least 30 minutes a day. Eat smaller portions through out the day, every few hours and EAT BREAKFAST. Breakfast is believed to kick start your metabolism, and eating a small healthy snack every few hours keeps it up and going.     Hope that helps man. :)

Clt9uTmNaa	The BMI index is completely outdated and inaccurate.  I watched Penn & Teller's BS show about it.  According to the BMI index, Brad Pitt is fat!!!    If you feel like you need to be healthier there are some simple changes.  I would start off by not drinking any soda at all.  Putting to the side if it's regular or diet, it's extremely expensive.  If you're like me and don't like just plain water, then buy the crystal light tubes that make up pitchers whenever they're on sale.  I keep a gallon in the fridge at all times, and when I need some for when I'm out, I fill up a water bottle, or any old soda bottle.  Not only is this a healthier choice, but it's also much cheaper.    Loosing weight is 80% diet and 20% exercise.  Eat lots of veggies.  Look in the Sunday paper for coupons for green giant frozen veggies or any other brand for that matter.  Wait until one of your local grocery stores puts them on sale, and go and stock up using coupons in addition to the sale.  Try to also eat lots of lean meats.  Grocery stores normally put boneless skinless chicken breasts on sale for $1.99 a pound about every two weeks.  Get as much as you can and freeze it so you have it available, and you got it at a better price.  Limit your starches such as white rice, potatoes, and white bread.  If you're going to eat a starch, get whole grain bread, or brown rice.      Remember to drink lots of water, and eat lots of fiber!    Taking the stairs is a great change.  Try building up muscle, because muscle is what burns fat.  Do walking lunges and squats for your legs, sit ups for your abs and push ups for your arms.  You can also take empty milk jugs and fill them up with water as a cheap way to make weights.    Also, don't try to make a lot of changes overnight.  Gradually make changes to your everyday routine, and you're more likely to succeed. If you have one bad day and eat lots of bad foods, or don't exercise for a week, don't let that discourage you, get back up the next day and start working back towards your goal. It will be hard at first, especially breaking the soda habit, but stick with it and after about a week you'll be over it.    I am a true believer in clipping coupons, and following store ads to save money.  You can cut your grocery bills in half or more by doing this.  Sometimes, you can even get things for free or next to nothing.  I suggest going to www.couponmom.com  It's completely free, has great tips, links to websites with printable coupons, and it will keep track of all your local stores sales, and tell you if there's a coupon out for the item on sale.   If you sign up to websites like betty crocker, SC johnson, right@home, and coupons.com you can print free coupons out, and even get them mailed to you.  Anyway to get your food and cleaners cheaper is great.    If you have cable tv you can always cut that off to save money.  I use www.fancast.com.  You'll be able to watch most of your favorite tv shows on there the day after they air.    Good luck with the weight loss, and I completely empathize with the money problems.  I hope these tips help you out.|`|n5ib2AC2aa	BMI are stttuupidd.  they dont count your muscle or anything.  im fat according to that thing too, but really im not.  your probably fine !!|`|bDvIGGeAaa	Hey there!  This is the first time I have answered on here!  My weight fluctuates often, but when I want to lose weight, this is what I do:    First off, I stop eating fast food (this helps with money issues too!) and purchase cheap food at the grocery store such as peas, carrots, chicken, rice, lettuce, fat free ranch dressing, eggs, oatmeal, etc.    Three meals a day, with a snack between breakfast and lunch.  Another snack between lunch and dinner.    I also stop drinking cokes.  Even diet cokes are harmful to the body.  I love tea, and I buy the lipton hot brew tea packs, they are like $3 for a pack of around 32.  I bought that in August and still have some.  I also drink plenty of water.    Exercise is an important step.  The other two suggestions help lose weight, but exercise speeds up the process and also tones the body (and you feel good).  I would walk on the tread mil for about 30 minutes, three times a week.  Nothing fancy, just walked without an incline, no weights, just simple walking.  After about 3 months I lost 30 pounds.  If you can't find time to walk, do a simple search on youtube.com for workout videos and do those 3 times a day for 30 minutes      Currently I am doing the p90x program, and it works very well!  It is expensive (around $120) but I bought it on ebay for $100.  It comes with 12 videos, meal plans (including a cook book) and the food is very easy to follow and substitute.    Good luck!
CNW6eAjoaa	I have been running for twenty years.  I think the best answer is to wear shorts that do not let your dork dangle.  No dangling dork,.....no dork damage! Don't dismiss dork damage.

Not only do they ruin your lungs but practically every other part of your body will be affected.  In my opinion there are no good reasons to smoke and cigarettes should be banned completely since they cut short so many lives.|`|pYjkxM7aaa	- raises your metabolism (and is an appetite suppressant) so you lose a bit of weight  - satisfies any oral fixations you may have (for people who love chewing gum and pen caps and anything else...)   - adds mystery to your persona (especially if you're the type of person who wouldn't normally smoke)  - great ice-breaker when you want to talk to a hottie outside of a bar (got a lighter? can i bum a cigarette?)  - Smokers have a 60% lower risk of Parkinson's disease  - having a cigarette when drunk is orgasmic   - Nicotine helps focus attention and improve memory  - smoking releases "feel good" dopamine into your system... which makes you happy  - gives you something to do instead of just looking bored... wherever you are, just whip out a cigarette  - it takes just 6 months after quiting smoking for the cilia to go back to fully functioning and protecting your lungs as if you had never smoked at all. (assuming you didn't get lung cancer...)
pYjkxM7aaa	It sounds like depression- but you might want to figure out the cause of it before jumping on medication. If it's a chemical imbalance.. then sure- yeah- medication.

yH8ZlwpTaa	Lose some weight, he'll come around.|`|DFJ9m4WKaa	I think you should follow your doctor's advice. You're bf's wang just needs a break - at least a week. The more he tries to get it up, the more he aggravates the muscle and keeps it from healing. So just take it easy and let it heal. If it persists for more than a few weeks, consider consulting a urologist, since they specialize in treating male problems.
VXW1XeFsaa	There are several medications that are effective against tapeworms.  In order to get them, you must go to a doctor, give a stool sample and let a laboratory determine which kind of parasite you have.  Then, they will know which medicine is most effective.  It can take 1 to 3 months to get rid of the infection this way.  You will need to have a stool sample examined again at this time to be sure there are no more parasites in you.  Since the medication only kills adults, the eggs will still pass out of your body alive.  Make sure you do not re-infect yourself from the eggs by thoroughly washing your hands after using the bathroom.|`|vhraHxtNaa	it sounds stupid but make some coffee and open your mouth and put your mouth next to the coffee..the tapeworms will come right out off your mouth..its pretty gross but i would rather have them come out of my mouth than my ***..try it, whats the worst thing that can happen?
f3d7e377a29aa0fee9567ce8e141d50aaa	Everyone has awesome abs!!   They are just under a layer of fat.  If you want them to show more just cut out all sugars and eat clean food (low sodium, low fat, lots of chicken, fresh veggies, brown rice, sweet potatoes) for a month or so and youll look great!!  This isnt for weight loss - it has an anti inflammatory effect - youll drop all that puffy water weight and tighten up.  Lots of models (not the skinny runway models) do this a week or so before a shoot because its a quick fix.

In all likelihood, he was probably already mentally stimulated before you got on top of him. Therefore, he did orgasm shortly after.

But my teth weren't even so bad and i had mine for 3 1/2 years|`|lFPsPzxzaa	until the dentist says they are straight and ready to come off. could be a year or longer maybe less it just depends on how bad they are|`|2mGSsASZaa	i have the same exact thing you do!!!  yeah anyways i got them put on like 2 weeks ago and he said they will appx. be on for a year and a half.... but u never know, they can also stay on longer if the dentist decides they need more time|`|99MYd45Xaa	I had the same EXACT thing.     My overbite was so bad that my bottom teeth were stabbing into the roof of my mouth.    I got braces in 6th grade, and I probably won't get them off until the end of this year. (I'm in 10th grade now.)    That's a grand total of 5 years.    But it all depends on your mouth and your orthodontist.  Hopefully you won't have yours on for so long.    Hope I helped! :]    (Oh, by the way:  You might have to wear this little thing in your mouth called a herbst.   It sucks, but that's what they use to fix overbite. Worked wonders on me. :])|`|ZtECjEPyaa	well it takes about 2 years but because of the condition of your teeth, it can be for about 2 and a half years.|`|bluAIRTFaa	probably two - three years.  i have braces, but before i got them i had one tooth that was up in my gums, after they got that tooth down, we thought it wouldn't be too much longer before i got the braces out, but they wanted to do lots of other things so it depends on who your orthodontist is, but generally you have them on longer then two years.  =)

RXI8ImdIaa	The illicit drugs should not affect an HIV test. It tests for the presence of a specific antibody, which is not affected by drug use.    What you really have to consider is how much time has passed. If it's been less than a few months, a test is not going to be definitive. However it's still advised that she go to a testing center for information about the disease process; it sounds like she could use a lot of educating on the topic.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	The drugs will not affect the HIV test. HIV testing looks for HIV antibodies, these antibodies are found with in your blood or tissue with in your mouth. HIV shows up 90% of the time after 30 days, 99.6% of the time with in 90 days of infection.    Depending if the sex has been less that 72 hours, he could go to the emergency room and talk about PEP, it is medications for people who may have been exposed to HIV, but it has to be with in 72 hours.
h6NqNzHAaa	Yes it is normal to have pain. Try to limit wearing shoes and if possible wear sandals so there is no pressure on the toe. You should be walking around by now, just be careful not to stub it or let your dog sit on it (mine did that, killed!)|`|4BoteYDwaa	I had the same thing done several years ago, I bought some neo-sporin with lidocaine in it, this helps the pain. Most importantly, buy well ventilated shoes, don't buy shoes just for looks. Keep your feet dry, otherwise you'll get another ingrown toenail later on.
AA11176387	hmm do you possibly have a shellfish allergy..maybe this might be contributing.    Have you tried taking a powder?    How about chlorella..it has similar benefits?  Maybe you could try it.    If not, wheat or barley grass or alfalfa have a lot of health benefits as a green drink
tBF9VfPqaa	Some times what happens is the orthodontist uses a special primes/sealant that creates a better bond between the braces and teeth, and it can have a slight yellowish hue to it. This is because many of them are fluoride releasing to help coat and protect the teeth from sugars and such sitting around the teeth and permanently staining them.    The reason why it looks so much better after the braces are off is because when they take the glue off the surface of the teeth with a hand piece and bur, it kind of 'polishes' that resin off.     It is very common. Now if there are more white spots on the teeth that is from either high amounts of fluoride (called fluorosis) or from food sitting around and breaking down the enamel of the teeth. (mostly from poor oral hygeine).    :) Take Care!!!|`|zKU0qUyHaa	hmm i have never noticed sorry|`|vI5MXxi6aa	It's because more food gets caught in their teeth. When the braces are off, there is more space and are to brush

Sometimes people can suddenly become lactose intolerant too though. Usually that comes witha  stomach ache though. You're fine and have nothing to worry about though!|`|AA11353824	I'm not sure what's wrong but I doubt it's anything to worry about. Your probably just eating a lot of fiber. Try beano before you eat. If it doesn't help you can always go to your doctor and ask for some suggestions. Hope things go well.

The carotid arteries specifically, happen to supply blood to the head/brain. The abdominal aorta supplies blood to the trunk and lower limbs.      The answer to your question is the aortic artery.|`|a4kTbjfeaa	Here is a picture of the anatomy:   http://www.texasheart.org/HIC/Anatomy/he...    The aorta carries blood from the left ventricle.

XL9CUrp2aa	You will lose weight pretty fast doing a low carb diet like south beach, but I think 40 pounds is alot in 2 months.  The heavier you are the more you will lose.  So maybe if you were like over 300 pounds it may actually be possible to lose 40 pounds in 2 months, but if you are just basically overweight or even around 200 pounds, 40 pounds is unrealistic.    But def. do a low carb, high protein diet and you will lose weight quickly and it is healthy.  Notice I say low carb not no carb.  You need some carbs, good carbs like veggies and wheats.|`|OB2JbmFcaa	Not possible, unless all you do is run and not eat anything. It takes about 8-14 months to do that; at least that's what I heard.|`|hnPgpulzaa	Yeah really. Starve yourself or start hackin' off those legs. Sorry hun.

Cut your calories by 500, and do 500 calories more exercise and you will lose 2 pounds that week.

As a healthy rule, a person should lose 1-2 pounds per week. Also, the longer it takes a person to lose weight, the longer it will stay off. Portion control and incorporating exercise gradually into your daily routine will significantly help you lose weight. Changing a behavior is difficult and can be overwhelming if it too drastic. Good luck!

You can try some light exercises though, such as jogging or speedwalking from anywhere for 1/2-1 hour.    Majority of fat burning comes from your muscles though, hence strength/resistance training.

If this comes up negative than look at a bladder medication like Detrol LA.  Have your prostate checked also while your talking to your doctor.  Probably not the issue but it's worth a check and it's a simple check.  One thing you can try is to empty your urethra completely after urination.  Do this buy reaching up under your balls and press up gently, this well help empty the urethra.|`|yH8ZlwpTaa	I would think that you may have an issue with your prostate or bladder infections from time to time.    Are you overweight ? You haven't said anything about that . If so, start doing Kegel's (you basically squeeze like you're shutting off urine flow) 20 reps for 5 to 10 times a day. The thing about Kegel's is that no one knows that you are doing them.   I would also recommend weight lifting and doing squats to improve the musculature in the pelvis.|`|PRqCRJm3aa	dont worry. its not sexually related. even girls have it. when i laugh too hrd. or sneeze. even jump on a trapoline, i do. same thing... im pretty sure theirs mediciine out there for guys, explain to the doctor, and tell her you would like mediciine for  it. :D|`|GJKsizL7aa	I am a leaker, also.  But, my leaking is for only a few minutes after urination.  My understanding is that after urination, normally the urethra immediately collapses from the bladder sphincter up to the meatus.  This collapsing forces all the urine out of the urethra.      In my case, I think my urinary incontinence is because the urethra does not collapse immediately.  Over a period of several minutes it slowly collapses.  A lot of urine comes out during that period.  When I am in a hurry, I can really soak my briefs.  I have to be really careful when I wear light colored slacks.  Shaking and squeezing don't really help.  Waiting does, but who wants to spend that much time at the urinal?    This is something that I have accepted and learned to live with.  The doctors I've talked to don't consider it a significant problem worth trying to solve.  I have done Kegel exercises and it does help somewhat.  At least doing the Kegel exercises the bladder sphincter is more likely to fully close and not contribute to the problem.    Find another urologist.  It also helps to do research before seeing the doctor.  Check out the links below.  I have prostate problems and I have gone to my urologist with a page of questions that I wanted to ask.  I get some good info this way.

They aren't really blisters, they are little cuts in the skin in side your cheeks, my tongue is touching THREE as I'm writing. I assume you are relatively new with braces? Use your wax, and don't worry! Unless it starts to spew pus (NOTICABLY) or turns a dark shade of purple, you should be fine.    If you have anymore questions about braces, contact  me at enounciate@live.com.|`|RGvNRH8Iaa	If the blister is on your gums, I would think about going to the dentist, but if it is anywhere else in your mouth I wouldnt worry about it.

eab67f43c0cff3a2dc3c807267bbd536aa	The disease is passed by infected Anopheles mosquitoes which injected parasites into blood streams of victims. The  Anopheles mosquito looks hostile wild, the tail is higher and head is much lower almost vertical position when biting.    Maybe over 500 millions people in tropical areas of developing countries suffered malaria yearly.  It has flu-like symptom but terrible fever, thirsty, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, muscle pain, sweeting, especially patients feel hot then chill by every few hours.      Only falciparum malaria is potentially life-threatening. Patients with severe falciparum malaria may develop liver and kidney failure, convulsions, and coma. Infections with P. vivax and P. ovale may cause less serious illness, but the parasites can remain dormant in the liver for many months, causing a reappearance of symptoms months or even years later!  It causes skin and eyes turn light yellow for a while.

DEF shame its not legal  good luck mate|`|B4diva6Qaa	In my, ahem, research, I've found that the combination of weed with an analgesic (like acetaminophen and codeine) is more effective at relieving discomfort than either by itself.    Weed is one of the safest drugs known, and is much safer than most over-the-counter drugs.  It's unlikely to interact with the Aleve.    Pressure from pharmaceutical corporations (who see weed as a competitor to their products) has prevented much research on this.

d1jMmApmaa	A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can check for viral DNA whether or not you have a visible lesion.  The PCR test is a highly sensitive test which can detect the HSV (herpes simplex virus) very soon after infection and sometimes before the onset of any symptoms. PCR can also determine the viral load if you are infected.  However, some doctors don't offer PCR for herpes so you may have to ask around to find a doctor who will.  Furthermore, chickenpox is a form of HSV so you may get a false positive as a result of your recent experience with chickenpox.  There are also blood tests available to test for HSV antibodies even when there are no symptoms and you may have to ask a different doctor to give you that test.  The most accurate tests are performed when there is a lesion present.|`|nFj30sZcaa	A lot of clinics are available that offer a free STD screenings. Find one in your local area and go there.

vfRHyZijaa	It helps to boost your metabolism, so instead of eating 3 large meals a day, eat 5-6 mini meals. Also, be sure that you excercize frequently, because if you burn more calories than you consume, you loose weight. Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables instead of going for that ice cream carton.  What I do to stay motivated is I keep a diet journal, and make sure that I write in it every night. I always right every single thing I put in my mouth that day, what excercize, and how I feel. I write about my cravings, my regrets, and things that I think I'm doing wrong. If you do this, you'll be more aware of your diet and when you begin overeating. Also, if you're craving something sweet or salty, I find that it helps to write in the diary because it stops your craving, and shows me the real reason I'm craving it (stress, habit, ect.). Good luck!
70a0Hk8Iaa	no junk food.  cut back on carbs.  no gravy over your food.  don't skip meals instead eat 4 or 5 small meals a day.  learn to read labels for calories (catsup is just red sugar).  move a lot - walking - dancing - sports  .....|`|hKRmXcyzaa	Here read these!

Start playing sports, running, and eating better.  No soda, juice, candy, etc.|`|cK8TnRHRaa	Diet is your most important factor. This may sound cliche, but I recommend weight watchers. They have an online program that teaches you how to eat smart and helps you create a healthy yet enjoyable diet.    Obviously, exercise as well. If you work out enough then you can be more lax in your diet. It's all about balance. In terms of what exercises to do, just find an activity you like and push yourself. Swimming is an incredible cardio workout and probably one of the best for weight loss, though running, or sports are just as good if you push yourself.|`|U1WUNCwLaa	replace all your soda's with water, dont buy junk food, if you have a craving drink water. most of the time our bodies signal to us that we are hungry when in actuality we are just thristy. keep a water bottle with you in ur backpack. start with a light walk every day for about 30 min and then increase the intesity or start running as you feel stronger.  Eat more fiber (fruits, veggies, whole wheat bread) and reduce the amount you eat. Eat slowly because we feel full 10 min after we are actually full, so that is 10 min of additional unnecessary food in our system.    dont get too down about your weight, just take your time and you wont notice drastic results, but you will feel better and have more energy. some weeks you will loose more than others so just keep up the work!|`|B1yhdTrvaa	Anthony Robbins has some good stuff on what drives us. I also am on a mission to lose weight and am already down 17 Lbs.   The two things that made a huge difference for me are these 1 - I sopped eating when preparing food, I was not aware I was  have a meal before the meal and another after the meal when I clean up. Now I only eat a meal sitting down and eating slowly. 2 - I did this exercise from a book about learning what is real hunger(link below) I ate breakfast and then nothing until dinner. By 6:00 I was hungry but it was not as bad as I thought. I used to be panicky about getting hungry. Usually when I want to eat, it is because I desire food or have a craving. Now I have this new tool, I scan my body and feel it is not real hunger, so I let it go and wait for my scheduled meal. I eat three meal and three small snacks. I am creating a video blog so you can check my progress and the things I am learning. In the future I may do a video on what Anthony Robbins talks about because it is super powerful.

d1jMmApmaa	AIDS is caused by HIV.    Most Common Methods of HIV Transmission:  Sharing hypodermic needles/syringes with an infected person  Unprotected intercourse with an infected person  Vaginal delivery of a baby by an infected mother   Breastfeeding of a baby by an infected mother  Blood transfusions received prior to 1994    The only disease you're likely to get from that nail, if you get one at all, is tetanus.  If your tetanus shot is up to date, just clean the wound and watch for signs of infection.  You should be fine.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	Unprotected sex and sharing needles with someone HIV+ is the major ways people get infected.

AA10038340	Yes, one persons idea of taking care of your teeth can be very different than a dentists/hygienists way of taking care of your teeth.   I get people in my office who tell me they brush 4 times a day and they floss everyday but they still have periodontal disease, which is disease of the bone surrounding the teeth. This is because either they were never taught correctly how to do it or they are just not capable. Meaning they are, how can I say it, spastic. And they will never do it right no matter how many times I show them. This is why a patient needs to come in at least twice a year for a professional cleaning and exam. Sometimes more, sometimes less.  So, to answer your question...all people who loose all their teeth lost them because of poor oral habits and they did not seek treatment when they should have. For whatever reason...no money, no insurance, fear of dentist. Sometimes a patient can have genetic periodontal disease; but that's rare.  I hope I answered your question. And I hope you take care of your teeth and go to the dentist regularly.|`|RG1B5ouyaa	That's not true about all people who have no teeth lost them due to poor hygiene.I am in the process of having my teeth pulled even though I did visit the dentist and had all the work done they still couldn't be saved.I spent a good portion of my late teens and early 20's severely anemic which damaged the enamel on my teeth.Then when I was pregnant I spent nine months throwing up 3-4 times a day every day which destroyed my teeth.They tried to do root canals and cleanings but there wasn't anything to save them.I now have a full upper denture and am in the process of getting a partial bottom now.I was told by my dentist that i was doing everything correctly but the combination of the weak enamel and the constant exposure to stomach acid there really wasn't anything we could do for them.It's something that you usually see in people who are bulimic but in my case it was just a case of poor genetics(most of the women in my family have a problem with anemia) and a rough pregnancy.

8OqdoIHtaa	Both you and your Dad are diagnosed at the same time? That is so weird!    The symptoms won't stop until he gets his blood sugar under good control, but they should improve slowly. Your dad is likely type 2, since he's an adult and probably over 40. Most people who are diagnosed as adults are type 2.     You might also be type 2, but if you are under 20 and thin, you might be type 1. You'll just have to wait and see what your doctor says.     Both you and your dad should drink lots of water, because it does help flush out the excess sugar in the blood.     You both should cut back on bread, potatoes, and especially sugar, fruit, and juices, pop, and baked goods, junk foods, and anything that is high carb. (read the nutritional label on foods).     Both you and your Dad could try the South Beach Diet, phase 2, until you can get to a diabetes dietician, for some guidance on what to eat and carb counting.

mqDj4976aa	Yes, these can all be related. You may have a urinary tract infection (different from an STD), which makes you feel like you have to pee, or burns when you pee, or makes you pee only a little, etc. This is a common complication of diabetes if your sugars have been running too high. As you know, bacteria love to grow in environments where high sugars have made a good home for them and infections are dangerous for all diabetics. This is why it is SO important to keep your sugars as closely controlled as possible. Additionally, having an infection can throw your sugars out of whack. Get to your doctor as soon as possible and get this checked out. You may need a course of antibiotics and to have your diabetes medications and/or insulin adjusted. Please take care of yourself.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	I am more concerned with the fact that you said  high blood sugar levels have been commone for a couple of  years.  Long term high blood sugar levels will cause bad complications.  You MUST  work with your endocrinologist to get your sugar level down.  Maybe when you get your sugar down, you'll pee less.  Start keeping a real thorough log of what you eat, and how much insulin you take.  Write down the time and accurately count the carbs.  Work with your parents or doctor to identify patterns of highs/lows.  You should be within range more than not to stay healthy.    Could be because your sugar is high so often, or could be a urinary tract infection.|`|m0SbpDkUaa	have u drinkin more water than usual? my dad had that happen to him last year and it was because his blood sugar was high...if u have blurry vision u should go to ur doctor soooon!!|`|iBPqutK5aa	Well, it could be a problem with your prostate, go to a urologist|`|gvgFfPwQaa	I have had diabetes since I was 15 and I often get the urge to pee every 10-20 minutes..

tBF9VfPqaa	There are companies such as:    Delta Dental  METLife  Aetna  Humana    Most orthodontic coverage has a lifetime maximum benefit (average) of about $1,500 to $2,000. This means that once it is used up, that is all they are covering.     They also usually pay 20% on what the down payment will be and 50% of the monthly payments.    You may want to weigh your options if you already have some type of basic dental plan. You just want to make sure that you are not paying them the monthly premiums and not getting that great of coverage.     Also check what restrictions there are on the coverage. Some do not cover adults, of if they do, it has to be so many months in treatment, etc.     The best thing is to ask around with family and friends and see who they have and what they think. Every plan is different, but those listed above are some of the major companies.     Hopefully this helps a little...

0e3034d2280fb2b424be0eff3932f8e1aa	The dentist I work for usually waits at least a couple weeks to rebuild the tooth (with post and permanent filling) and prep (prepare for crown and take impression). This is to make sure that there are not going to be any problems after sealing the canals.  There is also a wait time on the lab making the crown, usually 2-3 weeks unless they can put a rush on it.      Some insurance companies will pay for the crown by the prep date, others strictly upon insertion of the crown. Call them yourself and ask them this, that way you know for sure. Either way, as you said, it has to be done.  However, crowns are not cheap as you know, and I would try to use my insurance if possible.     Good luck!

Hey, it's a legitimate reason to go shopping and get a new wardrobe (or at least a lot of new pieces).    Depending on how bulky your brace is, you may have to adjust your size. Some braces are larger than others, some more visible than others. If you have to go up a size or two, but also check out maternity or plus clothes (some of the same designers for juniors and misses are designing for maternity and plus). Maternity tends to work better than plus because only your torso is changing shape and not your whole body.    I wore loose flowy tops in the warm weather, and sweat shirts and sweaters in the cool. Pants and shorts had to go up a size or you can uses one of those expand a waist button extender things, elastic waists, or draw stings.     I always wore a fitted sleeveless undershirt (A-shirt) under the brace (mens come in packages of 3 and are cheaper than womens) to prevent chafing. During the summer, if I was outside on hot day, when I came back in I wiped any skin that was under the brace down with rubbing alcohol to remove the sweaty, grimy feeling (get your mom to do your back); wiped down the inside of the brace; and changed into a fresh undershirt.    Good luck!
c6qpRqF5aa	Sounds like Bronchitis. Wet cough and thoughing up could be a sign. I think she needs Mucinex and antibiotics. Lots of broth like chicken too. Don't feed her alot and keep her warm with warm tea, apple juice and soup. If it doesnt work see a Dr soon.|`|44ab537503b323dcb61fd2a3b8221f88aa	I think she has the flu & old age.|`|lsiyoSRaaa	See a doctor.|`|AA11121577	I suggest talking to the correct person who has been to several years in college to know what is wrong with your Grandmother ..The person is called a Doctor.|`|ACyl5uQMaa	It sound's like it could be influenza, also known as the flu. Ask her where the back ache is, flu back aches are usually towards the bottom of your spine, known as the lumbar region. Aches and pains are symptoms of a tired body and weak body. Has she had flu injections and how old is she? One important question is to look at what medication she is on, is it just cough medication? If it is a cough medication it will defiantly take time work, especially with wet coughs as the body is ejecting the foreign chemicals through the wind pipe. I do suggest continue to watch her and take her to the doctor or take her again to the doctor since flu is serious for elderly.    In the mean time be there for her and continue to prescribed medication, if she continues to suffer than get her to the doctor who will be able to provide continue medical care.|`|IfCpPojxaa	I think that stomach pain is related to peptic ulcer ,related some medication if she takes, wet cough due to Bronchitis    must be go to the doctor ,
s4vb9spDaa	Start exercising. Make sure you have all your vitamins and minerals, Trying reducing your calories intake by 100-200 a day. If you have vitamin imbalance, your body can store fat from carbs.|`|ahfzZ665aa	How many meals are you eating a day? Alot of people dont realize this but if you go on a diet and only eat like a couple times a day you wont lose any weight and you might gain some This is beacuse your metabolisim slows down, You need to eat healthy small meals like 6-8 times a day. This will keep your metabolism up, and you will lose weight. Most importantly eat breakfast. It is true what they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Also, keep in mind, muscle weighs more than fat! So the weight you are gaining could just be muscle. Instead of focusing on weight loss, why dont you focus more on measurments? That would probably be a more accurate way of keeping track of how much your losing and gaining. The bloating thing...I cant help you there, i wish i knew the answer t o that i am always bloatedI am skinny and people constantly ask if i am pregnant cuz i am constantly bloated, and I have yet to figure out how the hell to stop  it. So if anyone knows the answer to that one hit me up too! I have always wanted to have a skinny stomach.|`|yJiWpvxSaa	well im not going to say that i eat too healthy but i eat the same all the time. and 3 weeks ago i started going t the gym weighting 215 and now i weight 220. i was like what the heck. instead of loosing weight i waned 5 pounds going to the gym and eating the same as always.|`|XEXTanc0aa	i have the same issue i hate it. i think its your body not knowing whats going on when suddenly witch to healthily food, so it stores it. i don't know. i doubt its a vitamin in balance unless you have a bad liver.|`|vfRHyZijaa	It helps to boost your metabolism, so instead of eating 3 large meals a day, eat 5-6 mini meals. Also, be sure that you excercize frequently, because if you burn more calories than you consume, you loose weight. Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables instead of going for that ice cream carton.  What I do to stay motivated is I keep a diet journal, and make sure that I write in it every night. I always right every single thing I put in my mouth that day, what excercize, and how I feel. I write about my cravings, my regrets, and things that I think I'm doing wrong. If you do this, you'll be more aware of your diet and when you begin overeating. Also, if you're craving something sweet or salty, I find that it helps to write in the diary because it stops your craving, and shows me the real reason I'm craving it (stress, habit, ect.). Good luck!|`|wg3KFiVqaa	Moderation is the key to any healthy lifestyle. If you eat 3500 kcals per day of healthy food, you will gain weight. Just because it's nutritious does not make it a "freebie." Also, was the fruit fresh, frozen, or canned? Canned fruit should be counted as a dessert within your diet because of its high sugar content.

The best diet out their is weight watchers. Or as my well concepts teach would say: balance moderation and variety.|`|vwjeG8n7aa	Never lower your calories.  Rule of thumb is to multiply your weight by 10 and that will give you the amount of calories you need to lose weight.  Go with a high protein and fiber diet.  If possible eat six meals a day.  As for extra fiber take Metamucil or what I like is the fiber choice orange chew tablets.  Carbs such as veggies and salad are fine.  Good luck

s6stLtvLaa	is this friend married to your sister?  If so then you really have no choice but to butt out.  I am HIV + and I have had an HIV- baby and my husband is negative after almost 5 years.  With all of the precautions taken today her chances of contracting the virus is 1%.  I am sure they have been told the risks, and I am sure they have been told the odds of her getting the virus as well as the baby.  This is their life, not yours, be happy and support them in a decision THEY made together.      On the other hand, if this is a new relationship, and they are not married then they need to have some sense knocked into them.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	I suspect it would be very expensive and it only lowers the virus in the sperm, not completely eliminate it.|`|XDf8xSyyaa	I personally would not support what he wants to do.|`|C3j22uMhaa	ARE YOU STUPID................YES REPORT HIM...SHE IS YOUR SISTER.........|`|4BoteYDwaa	This is not a safe procedure.

s4vb9spDaa	It all depends how your body works. It is referred to eat 1.5 - 2 hours before workout. Lots of carbs before workout. Carbs gives you energy.   Lot of protein and little carbs after workout. Protein helps you rebuild muscle tissue, you need some carb to give glucose in your muscle.  Make sure you have a  big workout.    Food before workout: Lentils (Boiled, one cup with little seasoning)  , best vegetable for carbs, protien, potassium, fiber and  any vitamins you want. Virtually no fat.  Potatoes, cabbage, banana etc  After workout: ISO protein shake, low fat milk, beans, lentils.|`|RKMgokm6aa	I wouldn't suggest working out on a full stomach, but it won't hurt you that much. You should ingest protein before and after your workout. Infact, you should be eating protein all throughout the day. Protein is the best food for building muscle as are fruits, vegetables, and complex carbohydrates such as wheat bread, oatmeal, sweet potatoes, etc.

For your situation the best thing I can tell you to do is remember that there is nobody in this world that is better or more important than you are.  Everything you have to say is just as valid as anything that others have to say.  Nothing bad will happen if you are just yourself.. and if someone does happen to look down their nose at you.. that is their problem and not yours.  Also, just practice talking to people.  You can start with something as dumb as simply saying Hi to people you pass in the grocery store.  Doesn't matter if you feel 'silly' it will help|`|Y3EUTUwLaa	relax and avoid caffeine.  eat low fat.  check your blood sugar.

5bb013e7455bc352bf3e92e885bba51daa	I don't know any other exercises but your problem is most likely your arch. I would recommend getting some good arch supports.|`|pqnEavSyaa	The most common cause of arch pain is Plantar Fasciitis. Plantar Fasciitis involves inflammation of the Plantar Fascia - the fibrous band of tissue that connects the heel bone to the toes. Someone with arch pain usually has inflammation of the tissues within the mid-foot.     Plantar Fasciitis is caused by over-stretching of the Plantar Fascia. Repeated strain can cause tiny tears in the ligament. These can lead to inflammation, irritation, pain and swelling. Arch pain is more likely to happen when:    -- the feet roll inward too much (over-pronation)    -- walking, standing, or running for long periods of time, especially on hard surfaces    -- excess weight    -- tight Achilles tendons and/or calf muscles    Medical research on foot pain found that a combination of stretching exercises and wearing a standard, off-the-shelf orthotic shoe insert is the most effective way of dealing with arch pain.  This treatment regime is also very effective for the treatment of heel pain.    An explanation of the importance that proper arch support plays in controlling over-pronation, and some stretching exercises for relief are provided in the links below:
aO5uVFwIaa	Ya it would definitely suck to not feel anything. My advice is to talk to a doctor and maybe get some pills that help you not be so depressed. If you don't want to do that, what works for me is to find something to look forward to, although if you are completely numb, this may be hard to do. At least try. What interests you, if anything at all? Try to have fun. I hope this is kind of what you are looking for. If not, sorry.|`|TK4Tj9FPaa	It sounds like your very depressed.

You have to set goals to reach, something to look forward too, otherwise life is dull to anyone.|`|V90Ao2jfaa	when is the last time you smoked/drank/popped a pill etc? if it hasn't been months to years then ofcourse you're not going to see much improvement but if it has been years then you might want to consult a doctor. Your body and brain tissue grows back but not fully and it depends on your age.|`|cIQZZHVzaa	Ecstasy burns out the part of your brain that generates serotonin (happy chemical).    There's not much more to say than that... don't use harmful drugs?  Your brain may develop a higher sensitivity to the serotonin it CAN still generate over time again.    Don't let anyone tell you "this drug will help"-  Ha.  Psych companies love people like you who want "hope" again.    Drug use aside, lacking vitamin B will cause you to get depressed. Also D to absorb calcium. (Get some sunlight.)|`|M0mVCl4Uaa	i think its cuz now, without drugs, u have this constant thought in ur head saying like, "ok, wut am i gonna do now..." its like being burnt for a really long time u kno, u just dont give about anything nd u just dont care.|`|8VEEihaqaa	Actually, what you're experiencing is depression.  Depression is most often what leads to drug abuse because nobody wants to feel sad all the time, so while you're only noticing it now, the depression has probably been there for a while and could have subconsciously triggered your drug abuse.  Like CK said, that's not nearly enough drugs to mess you up as bad as you think you're messed up.    As for how to fix it, psycho-therapy is the best answer.  It can help you get to the root of your problem and learn to live your life again.  Remember, you're not stuck with one therapist for seeing them once; if you don't feel comfortable seeing one therapist, try another one until you find one that you like.    I'm sure someone will try to put you on anti-depressants, not my favorite thing in the world.  For some people they can be helpful, but for others they can make things worse.  If you choose to try anti-depressants as a crutch to the therapy, make sure they are well monitored and tell your doctor if you experience any kind of change in mood or thinking.    Have you thought maybe you're just bored?  Try a change in your routine, hang out somewhere different. go out with friends you don't usually hang out with, learn something new.|`|LZ5JLq1oaa	I have a family member that has been sent to countless rehabs for her addiction and she has lost herself and I am afraid we will never get her back, but I also know a girl that partied quite often. She did cocaine, drank vodka for breakfast, and smoked weed. She quit one day, just like that. She is one of the nicest, happiest people I know. I wish you all the best and I hope you leave the drugs alone. It is not worth it.        What happens to your brain when you take drugs?    Drugs are chemicals that tap into the brains communication system and disrupt the way nerve cells normally send, receive, and process information. There are at least two ways that drugs are able to do this: (1) by imitating the brains natural chemical messengers, and/or (2) by overstimulating the reward circuit of the brain.    Some drugs, such as marijuana and heroin, have a similar structure to chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, which are naturally produced by the brain. Because of this similarity, these drugs are able to fool the brains receptors and activate nerve cells to send abnormal messages.    Other drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine, can cause the nerve cells to release abnormally large amounts of natural neurotransmitters, or prevent the normal recycling of these brain chemicals, which is needed to shut off the signal between neurons. This disruption produces a greatly amplified message that ultimately disrupts normal communication patterns.    Nearly all drugs, directly or indirectly, target the brains reward system by flooding the circuit with dopamine. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter present in regions of the brain that control movement, emotion, motivation, and feelings of pleasure. The overstimulation of this system, which normally responds to natural behaviors that are linked to survival (eating, spending time with loved ones, etc.), produces euphoric effects in response to the drugs. This reaction sets in motion a pattern that teaches people to repeat the behavior of abusing drugs.    As a person continues to abuse drugs, the brain adapts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine by producing less dopamine or by reducing the number of dopamine receptors in the reward circuit. As a result, dopamines impact on the reward circuit is lessened, reducing the abusers ability to enjoy the drugs and the things that previously brought pleasure. This decrease compels those addicted to drugs to keep abusing drugs in order to attempt to bring their dopamine function back to normal. And, they may now require larger amounts of the drug than they first did to achieve the dopamine highan effect known as tolerance.    Long-term abuse causes changes in other brain chemical systems and circuits as well. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that influences the reward circuit and the ability to learn. When the optimal concentration of glutamate is altered by drug abuse, the brain attempts to compensate, which can impair cognitive function. Drugs of abuse facilitate nonconscious (conditioned) learning, which leads the user to experience uncontrollable cravings when they see a place or person they associate with the drug experience, even when the drug itself is not available. Brain imaging studies of drug-addicted individuals show changes in areas of the brain that are critical to judgment, decisionmaking, learning and memory, and behavior control. Together, these changes can drive an abuser to seek out and take drugs compulsively despite adverse consequencesin other words, to become addicted to drugs.|`|5vbWDqjNaa	Seems like you may be depressed.

Depression can alter your personality and the way you think. My advice is to drink plenty of liquids, get daily exercise, and if you still feel this problem nagging at you in a couple weeks, go to a doctor or even a psychiatrist.

If you want to die...then ask yourself why... if it's because you're all depressed then what is something you like to do?  Art, games, running, sports, etc and get active in trying to see the sunshine in life.  Some times you just have to push yourself to do something that you don't think you'd ever like and then you end up loving it.  Just push yourself.

Everything is more exciting when you are younger and when you realize it's not that exciting, it's depressing.  Time goes by faster, etc.  Maybe you should see a doctor about depression.  I don't think it has anything to do with drugs if you are not longer on drugs.  If you still do drugs, it probably has everything to do with it.  Drugs make people emotional rollercoasters.  Don't do drugs anymore and go to the doctor.|`|EtYP9QwRaa	its because you became addicted to drugs.It kind of feels like you have nothing to live for so why not kill yourself?Dont get into that.Talk to someone to help you.you really need help.

You wouldn't be asking this question if it was broken.  But there is obviously something going on.  Question for you, does your bottom of your heal hurt at all when you run?  If it does it is possible you have calcaneal appophysitis. look that up on google, and have a look.    I recomend you don't bother going to the docters because all he/she will do is give you an x-ray, and and that's gonna cost, but how it sounds i doubt anything is fractured. But i do recommend going to a physio.. if your anywhere near clayton go to the guy on centre road. if not, go to your local physio.. He will definatelly find out whats  wrong and give you some exersises to do to strengthen whatever is wrong and may give you some fast healing ultrasoundsss... But how it asounds its probabally just inflammatory or something.  Give the phsio a look.     Was it graduall, or sudden?

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call.    www.xattack.in

AA11664585	for any kind of skin irritation i use cortizone 10!!  i love the stuff!  but that normally happens because your pores are open and letting out the sweat, which means it is prime time to let bad things in, which creates itching. so first of all take a shower when all those little pores are open to get all the bad stuff out, and use the cortizone. if it keep happening, go to the dermatologist!
k7MINvaIaa	1) First, is this even possible?  Yes; sometimes... but its readily treatable.    2) Is there something that person can do to make it any faster?  Not usually.    3) At what age should it be expected?  Varies...    4) And lastly, what happens to make this happen (if at all possible)?  Modest changes in conduction properties.    Electrical activity travels in a sort of continuous circuit... a bit like a dog chasing its tail. This is called AVNRT and is a common form of SVT. Most of the SVTs are treatable with a procedure called an ablation. The doctor who does this is called an Electrophysiologist. You might ask your mom and dad to have you evaluated by one. An ablation might potentially offer a permanent solution to your problem.

d9c8yRacaa	Sounds like tough going for you. I'm just glad for you that you can at least rely on your friends and boyfriend to be there for you. Is there a counsellor, a nurse or something you can talk to in school about what is going on in your life at home. They often have experience mediating between students and parents. Perhaps you could talk to an aunt or uncle, someone who knows your parents very well and they could mediate for you. It sounds to me like your folks have a hard time listening to reason like the time you went to family counselling so it is important someone you both trust is involved. Hopefully then they can learn to loosen up and let you lead your own life a bit more and help you to deal with your depression.

For your carpet there is this pet odor stuff and its a pawder and you sprinkle it on your carpet leave it for about 10 minutes and then vacuum it. Maybe that will help.

I'm a nonsmoker, so I can smell it really well. What works for us though is opening windows and letting it air out. You need to let the stinky air out of the house and let fresh air in. The oxygen should help you. Also, what also would help you are Cinnamon scented candles.     That alwaysss helps us. Those smell sweet, strong and cover the odor.  Always burn those when they have to smoke indoors.. or let them assign a room in the house to smoke in and just tell them to open the window or something when they have to light up.

Or you could just wait.    Depending on how bad it is, it may require things like cleaning or replacing the carpet, repainting the walls, cleaning the furnace ducts, etc.  Even after all that, the smell of smoke will be retained by wood and other porous materials, and those things may always smell faintly of smoke.
AA11591747	It only takes a minute to read this...    A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim within 3 hours he  can totally reverse the effects of a stroke...totally. He said the trick was  getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient  medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.    RECOGNIZING A STROKE    Thank God for the sense to remember the "3" steps, STR. Read and Learn!    Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the  lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain  damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.  Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple  questions:          S *       Ask the individual to SMILE .            T *      Ask the person to TALK  to SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE                             (Coherently) (i.e. . . It is sunny out  today)          R *     Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS.    *NOTE: Another 'sign' of a stroke is this:                Ask the person to 'stick' out their tongue.  If the tongue is  'crooked', if it goes to one side or the other, that is also an indication  of a stroke.   If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call  911 immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher.|`|QfmeCc2Uaa	Take him to the doctor!!!|`|XDf8xSyyaa	Um....you are supposed to take him to a doctor and have him checked by a health professional instead of guessing yourself what it "might" be!|`|bLplapNIaa	I agree get him to the nearest hospital ASAP!

You constantly feel irritable, sad, or angry.    Nothing seems fun anymore, and you just dont see the point of trying.    You feel bad about yourselfworthless, guilty, or just "wrong" in some way    You sleep too much or not enough.    You have frequent, unexplained headaches or other physical problems.    Anything and everything makes you cry.    Youve gained or lost weight without consciously trying to.    You just cant concentrate. Your grades may be plummeting because of it.

Clinical depression involves feeling down for two weeks or more consecutively. So I would think about how long you've been feeling this way. It sounds to me like it may have already been awhile.     Depression creeps up on you gradually. It does not happen overnight. Remember that what you are going through is normal and you are not alone.    I can say all of these things b/c I've been dealing with clinical depression for over a year now. I see a counselor regularly and am taking an anti-depressant called prozac. I recently had to increase my dosage b/c the medicine starts to lose its effect after awhile.    If you go to therapy and or take meds I guarantee you will feel better. Don't avoid therapy b/c of any misconceptions you have about it. Going to therapy does not mean you are weird or anything like that. Going to therapy takes strength and courage. These are the qualities that will get you through this.    I know you can do it. I believe in you and I hope you feel better soon!|`|AA11703652	It sounds to me like you are a tired teenager- in other words, normal.

Crying helps some, too-if you feel like it, cry HARD.  You might feel better afterward.  Adolescence sucks, but it's sucky for everybody, and if your friends tell you they're not going through all kinds of crap, they're either lying, or it hasn't really hit them yet.  You will be fine--please know that and if you ever feel worse, like doing something reckless, tell someone-your parents, a counselor, at least a friend.

P:  Honestly, if you just involve yourself in your academics, enjoy the sports you do, talk to the team and enjoy what you do and hang out with friends on the weekends you'll get better!   Whenever I get emotionally unbalanced I talk to myself about how much longer I can prolong re-cutting myself.  And that I"m proud about that.    One thing that REALLY helps, is grabbing my ipod and setting it to a playlist of noise.  Just music that's really energizing, and all I do is SPRINT.  I push my feet against the ground as hard as I can and run until I feel like I'm about to collapse.  It helps. A lot.    Good luck!

rDZlcIoraa	hi,  Its very hard isnt it,especially if your very close to this person as you say.  Firstly your seem to be very on the ball about how they have to want to give up by saying "They can only stop if they want to stop" and how right you are.  Heroin addiction is very cunning,baffling and powerful and hurts many people who use it,abuse it,and the families and friends of the users are always hurt one way or another.  You sound like your very close with this person and it must be killing you watch this person hurting themselves...because thats exactly what they are doing.  You say your hiding the fact that they are doing this from other people which is another extremley hard thing to do in its self and extremley unfair on you.  This person you love cannot help what they are doing,they really cant...as its an addiction and this addiction makes them steal,lie and cheat so they can get their next supply,they will do anything for it,and mate it does get worse before it gets better.  This person can be gently guided but that wont work until they really are ready to kick the habit.  No matter how much this person loves you.  Also they may love you very much but they cant stop using..  If this person wants to come off heroin they will need to be profressionally detoxed as its extremley horrible and can be dangerous if they come off it.  This heroin addiction has another phase called "The Monkey on your Back" and its just that....you cant shake it off until its grabbed completly and pulled off.  They are many things you can do if your friend wants to come off.You can ring(Narcotics Anonoymous) in your area for one...they are a great help and will go to any length to help you...and give you good advice as well.  If this person just plain wont come off when you ask them and tell them you will help them...its time to take a back seat and hope like crazy they will one day wont off the stuff and i really pray for you and your friend that this day is soon as heroin is not a good drug to be struggling with.  No matter what you say to your friend if they are in the midst of their addiction...if they dont wont to get off it..majority of the time they wont UNTIL THEY ARE READY...  So i dont know if you live with this friend or how close you are,put the help to this person and tell them how much you care and then its time for a back seat ok as if you dont you will go crazy and the pain will be unberable.  You can suggest all the things to help and leave it at that.  Yes its very hard watching someone close use heroin and i know that for a fact...Its very,very serious.  I lost my boyfriend to it as he overdosed and died and i couldnt do a thing to help him...i tried but he ended up doing it behind my back anyway.  I cant tell you how crucial it is to get yourself some help ok as this is going to be a very rocky ride.  Its all very well saying "O tell them to stop or leave them" but i know from alot of experience...it dont work that way.  Also there is a drug called Methadone which is given to heroin addicts to help them come off Heroin and is given by the health professionals and they monitor you on it and is a good way as well.  So that is all i can give you...If they want the help there is alot out there...and help for you is crucial as well as you are suffering as well and if they dont want help....get help for you if you want to stick by this person.  If you do decide to stick it out....Never give money to them and watch anything of value in the house,and anything thats worth money hide it or whatever ok.  I wish you all the best and try and stay strong.  If you decide not to stay...that is good as well...never feel guilty ok as this person has made the choice and its not your fault...dont ever think that way....EVA.  This is entirely their choice,you cant save them,only they can do that.    Take care of you is important as you can only do so much    Your in my thoughts and prayers|`|6cN8aLnaaa	I wish I could help more, but you're right you can't make them quit until they are ready. As a recovering addict myself I know how hard it is to want to quit and I don't believe I ever would have had I not had such a wonderful reason to as my baby girl. It took me getting pregnant it's probably going to take some form of reality check for them to quit as well. I hope that's sooner than later because I know that a life of drugs only leads to death or prison. I have been sober for almost a year now. I wish you and your friend both the best!|`|d9c8yRacaa	It sounds to me like you are already a great support for this person - you clearly have so much love for them. Still, if they feel bad for what they are doing and stop it then you can forgive them, but they can't have much love or respect for you if they continue to do this so it is time for you to move on from this person. Maybe they believe they are nothing and would amount to nothing in life but it is their issue and not yours. For your own sake please move on, you have done so much for this person already and they continue to throw it in your face - find someone who really loves and respects you in return.

LI64IZCWaa	I have. I bought mine online at http://www.lbweyewear.com however they don't have any name brand glasses. I am pretty happy with the glasses I got everything went fine. My only problem is that they are a little big, but that is because I've never bought glasses before so I didn't really know my size too well and you cant exactly try things on online lol.|`|fWc8Mki8aa	Yes, I ordered glasses from Zinnioptical.com.  As long as you have your prescription and your pupil distance (PD), then you can order.  If you don't have your PD, go to Walmart and they'll measure it for you (but I wouldn't mention why you want it).  Zinni's website says it takes two weeks but it really takes almost two months so don't be a hurry; they are produced overseas.    I received my glasses a few months ago and I have to say these are the best glasses I've ever had.  I will always order from them in the future - it is totally worth the wait!

XgJ5YXVFaa	I'm sorry about your accident. Just be grateful that you were not seriously hurt. The scar is a part of you now, so you just have to accept that. It will be there forever. I'm sure you look fine, anyways! I don't mean to sound harsh, but it's no use to miss your "old face" because your scar isn't going anywhere. It's a part of your face now, and you CAN be beautiful with it there.     Good luck! And remember, confidence is the best type of beauty. If you wear your scar without insecurity, it will not stand out to anyone else. I doubt that it does, we just tend to emphasize our own faults at times.|`|d9c8yRacaa	Hi there. It's going to take time to get used to it, but one day your will begin to see your scar as a part of yourself, a part of your character and a story to tell. For me I always find things like scars, slightly chipped teeth, a mole or something to make someone unique and still beautiful at the same time. In the meantime there are makeups you can use to cover scars quite well and in time the scar will fade somewhat. Hope you are recovering well after your accident. Take care|`|6nDqvtwbaa	Well, the people who really love you won't give a darn about the little scar on your face.    You're probably an attractive person.  Thank God that He gave you the good looks that you have.  Not everyone is physically attractive but I think maybe some of the nicest people are probably the ones who are not really attractive...sometimes anyways.    I got a gash on my neck and some very very small scars on my face from doing a face plant into a truck on my motorcycle at 45 mph with no helmet...I guess I should not be typing this right now....Yikes maybe I"m a ghost!    Well lighten up.  It could have  been much worse right?|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Your scar has not had time to heal to it's final configuration. It may hardly be noticeable.

8oRGz4Anaa	Its perfectly fine.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I prefer tampons (I'm a swimmer).  When I started using them, I stood up with my legs apart and put a mirror under my legs to help.  It's easier with a tampon with a plastic applicator.  Add some Vaseline if that makes it easier.  I still insert tampons while standing...maybe that's weird.  But if you prefer pads, it's entirely your choice.|`|6cN8aLnaaa	You use whatever you are comfortable with. If it wasn't ok to wear pads they wouldn't make them. lol Some women just aren't made to wear tampons.|`|d2zGNPUoaa	yeah its totally fine, i have used them my whole life. there is nothing wrong with them, you just can't swim with them and sometimes they can be a little uncomfortable.|`|3zg7oBA5aa	I prefer pads.

Its whatever you prefer. I didnt like tampons either until I tried the ones with the plastic applicator, like Tampax pearl. The cardboard ones are uncomfortable to me.

Some women just like tampons because it feels normal and theres no bulk.|`|Z6oc1VgSaa	dude i never use tampons. i think i've tried them twice in all and i just don't like them. I'm 19 and i've had my period for 6 or 7 years and i always use pads. there's nothing wrong with it. some women might think you're crazy though. lol i know that sometimes when i tell people i don't use tampons they're like "whaaat? but they're so much more convenient! blah blah blah" but i'd just rather use pads. even if they're a little more uncomfortable for some people, tampons just make me uncomfortable. i don't like the idea of something sitting in there all day. and i'm nervous that i'd forget to change them and get an infection or something. gross i know.     so yeah, take it from me there's nothing wrong with it and lots of women prefer pads. including me!|`|RxDUl6tvaa	It could be hard to put tampons in because of the size of the tampon, Playtex has the slender ones now that would probably work for you, and in the box of tampons they have a paper that shows easy ways to get them put it (i had trouble the first few times also), but i did use pads for a long time i started when i was in 4th grade and i used them till i was in 7th grade then started using tampons,  But there is no difference in using tampons over pads or Viceversa, except tampons would be recommended if you went swimming while you was on your period, I use tampons because there more comfortable to me, but that's me, and people have there own opinion about that kinda stuff..   So there is no need for you to feel like its a bad thing that you use pads instead of tampons, because everyone has there own different opinions..  Hope i could help
newfiOPOaa	You should alternate workouts.  Upper body (arms, shoulders, chest, upper back one day, lower body, legs hips, lower back, buttocks the next.

067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	tuna, chicken, ham, turkey...all are great sandwiches.   You can pretty much through anything on a sandwich.  I would recommend going into the deli section of a walmart of substitute and buying alot of fresh meats, throw a bit of cheese in there too (try to stick away from cheddar though).     I usually go with a tuna sandwich with a apple, but i also eat every 2 hours so i generally don't need that big of a lunch.    Cruise by walmart, see what you can find.  Remember if you make it, its usually healthier. ex. don't buy a pre-madesandwichh, or anything that all you have to do is heat up.    Stick with fruits, rice isn'tt that hard to take either. andsandwichh.

If you take your antibiotic at the same with alcohol, it can possibly cause an upset stomach and other similar symptoms. The consumption of alcohol decreases the effectiveness of antibiotics and even a single drink or several drinks of alcohol can inhibit a drug's metabolism by competing with the drug for the same set of metabolizing enzymes.

However, it can be very stressful as well. Mom has always been a part of our lives from the day we were born. Basically there is nothing to hide from her at all. The reason why we are have such a difficult time doing so is because we have moved away from her. Talking to her becomes a chore.    I suppose you can just approach her and let her know your feelings. Mom will never shy away from her love ones. Though she may not be able to understand all that you have said, but at least she lends a listening ear. Always there for you when you are troubled. You can be very open with her, approach her just like you would when you were a young girl. Do you hide from your mom when you were just 3 years old? Never.    So go ahead and talk to her. Remember you are always her child, no matter what. Chinese has a saying .....

But if you need to tell your mom first, try to make time where she don't be distracted and tell her that you have been feeling very low and that you would like help in finding someone to talk to.

It extends into the hepato-duodenal ligament and divides into the right and left branches to supply both lobes of the liver. Its trunk measures 5 to 7 cm in length. The portal vein drains blood from the GI trunk, including the esophagus, bowels, pancreas, gallbladder, spleen, and rectal venous plexus. The portal venous blood traverses the liver and drains into the inferior vena cava via the hepatic veins. The size of its branches tapers from the portal hepatis to the liver periphery. They are surrounded by fibrous tissue unique to portal veins. There are no valves. The portal vein forms important anastomoses with esophageal, rectal venous plexus, and superficial veins of the abdomen.    Characteristically, the SMV is located anteriorly and to the right of the superior mesenteric artery and posteriorly medial to the head of the pancreas. The SMV tributaries are the ileocolonic, pancreatoduodenal, gastroepiploic veins. Normally, the SMV measures 1.2 cm. Its size was reported as abnormal if it measured 1.4 to 1.6 cm in transverse diameter or showed abrupt change of caliber along its course.    The size of portal vein and its tributary increases in inspiration and decreases in expiration.    Take care always! OIRAM
hnPgpulzaa	Well maybe you can work out at home, it's what I do. It's a lot cheaper. Once you start feeling more confident (and you will) you can progress to the gym, or not. I mean there are so many things in out atural environment that can be used for exercise. os it's your preference.    Here's a cool video of some guys using the environment ot their advantage. They'r conditioning for a sport called parkour, byt hte way:    http://ca.youtube.com/watch?v=X15VRzQHq2...    You can also jog/run/sprint/run up hills.      If you're still self concious about exercising out of doors, there are lots of opportunities inside as. Jumping rope is about the best thing you cna do inside. It burns lots of calories and is a good overall workout. Increase the duration of your jumping rope each session. Start small, work up to longer times.    If you have stairs, run up and down them, and also do two footed hops all the way up the stairs, then run down.     set an obstacle/box/stool/higher level and jump over it/on top of it, set up an obstacle course etc.    Push ups, sit ups, crunches. Invest in a exercise ball, some hand weights, a medecine ball if you want.    Search home workouts, home exercises and anything liek that. You'll find a bunch of stuff.    Also consider joining a sport.    Most importantly, be confident, don't let yourself hold yourself back. Who the heck cares what anyone else thinks, right? Everyone started somewhere. People at the gym know that akward first feeling, and they wont put you down for it. Work on your self esteem.    And good luck!|`|zwh9ELMIaa	I was the same way about the gym.  If you don't go you'll always be a little intimidated *****.  In reality people in the gym don't look down upon weaker/fatter people.  That's why they're in the gym, to better themselves.    In short, quit being such a *****.  No one cares you're there.  Also, compound lifts, do them.  Doing set after set of bicep curls wont do anything...

It may take several years for the hormones that control menstruation to reach a balance. Many teens have irregular menstrual cycles because their body is getting used to releasing hormones. Some reasons for an irregular period include:    -Excessive weight loss or gain. Although low body weight is a common cause of missed or irregular periods, obesity also can cause menstrual problems.   -Eating disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia. For more information, see the topic Anorexia Nervosa or Bulimia Nervosa.   Increased exercise. Missed periods are common in endurance athletes.   -Extreme emotional stress.   -Travel.   -Medications, such as hormonal birth control methods, which may cause lighter, less frequent, more frequent, or skipped periods.   Hormonal abnormalities, which cause fluctuating levels of the hormones needed to support menstruation.   -Illegal drug use.|`|GUJ60P72aa	when youre young youre period is going to be weird until you get older and use to the cycle. dont worry   unless you havent had sex then theres nothing to worry about.|`|8oRGz4Anaa	For your age it is fine, you are just irregular.|`|CS3W706xaa	sometimes woman's ody gets interrupted by pill syn-tums if you are taking daily pills check the sen-tums

You are watching what you eat, but are you consuming enough throughout the day. Try eating 5 to 6 small meals a day. I know that sounds weird but it will get your energy and metabolism rev ed up.  Every 2 to 3 hours you should  be consuming something like an apple and some yogurt.  There are a lot of tips and ideas out there for healthy snacks.  Try looking up fat burning foods.  It will give you ideas of foods that naturally burn fat in our bodies.  Lastly be patient.  Your metabolism has had 18 months to slow it self down.  Try these things for 3 months to get it to really start seeing results.  I know for me getting out and really walking 5 to 6 times a week -like really speed walking 2-3 miles will really do it if you are really determined.

Its not only what you eat that keeps you fit, its other things too like exercising on a regular bases, getting enough sleep so that your not tired and feel lazy, eating alot of smaller meals through out the day.

Yes it takes some time for the metabolism to adjust and then lose weight.  First of all you are losing size an important factor. second you know muscle weighs more-remember that.  third eat the same but maybe reduce the amount of calories.  keep following your nutricianists plan. ask them before you change your diet. it seems to be working if your losing inches.  David W is not totally right or wrong.  The body needs protein to feed muscle. and carbs to feed the body energy.
6e18fc1a09702a5eb6bce6e69e2c689aaa	To reduce your thighs/butt, I would recommend two types of training to tone, tighten and firm up your lower body. The first is to incorporate high rep strength training movements into your plan. Shoot for 15-20 reps per set and use lighter weights since you're more focused on toning. Here are the best thighs/butt exercises to do:    http://shapefit.com/butt-shaping-exercis...    I would also recommend starting a running program to really tone and shape your legs and butt to give you that tapered look your going for. Start off with very short distances and shoot for 1/2 mile when you first begin at about a 10 minute mile pace. Every week try to increase your distance 1/2 mile and try to decrease your run time. After your run, you might want to 4-5 short sprints of about 40-50 yards. These sprints are great for explosive movements and for getting that really lean look. You might also want to incorporate jumping rope into your cardio plan. This is one of the best overall body workouts you can do to burn major calories and tone your entire body.

I like apples.|`|hnPgpulzaa	If you have an air popper, air popped popcorn. Watermelon. Celery. Rice crackers. An apple. Cherry tomatoes. Shrimp. Some canned light tuna. cantaloupe. Cucumber ( you can put it in vinegar). There are lots of things, be creative! Even make something out of the things I've listed.
GWesQiTPaa	your hott :) dont cut your hair i love it how it is its cute :)|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Personally, I like a guy with some hair on his head, and yours looks good, but could stand a trim and some out of your eyes.  I hate these crew cuts and almost bald haircuts.  I like a guy to have some hair to run hands through.  Keep most of your hair.    best wishes..|`|a7zveuseaa	its nice to change every once in a while so why not. get a nice hair cut. not too short though|`|pC9fLEzVaa	buzz cut it, that would look good|`|7bU8jRnDaa	yes u should get 1|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	You look unhappy with your current cut.|`|sK9kDAtLaa	ya

W1tx1p2iaa	It can only help you if you are tested and have dyslexia.  You will learn how to compensate for it.  Your grades will go up and you will learn things faster.
VIM4XmYNaa	I will tell you my experience with Proactive:  Proactive, for me at least, is very sensitive.  It seems that if you put too much on, your skin will not get results and it may even worsen.  You have too put the perfect amount on.  For the Step 1 lotion you should use about a nickel size amount.  For Step 2, about a dime.  And Step 3 should be no more than a pea.  After I learned this, I realized I had been using twice the amount I should have, and I saw immediate results.  Remember, never put too much on.  Its really great and works well when you put the perfect amount on.  Hope that helps!|`|NHKOVg4Taa	What you need to understand Proactiv will not cure acne only reduce the problem, it can like others cause peeling, irritation and make the skin feel dry.  The question is are you drinking plenty of water and maintaining a healthy well balanced diet?|`|1nFQhnOKaa	I wouldn't continue using it if its not working.    I was on proactiv for quite a while and all of a sudden, it stopped working.  I read somewhere to wash with a natural bar soap (such as Dr. Bronners) or any mild soap.  Then, make a paste of baking soda and some water.  Rub this on your face gently in the am and pm, and rinse off.    It worked for me, and even in a few days my skin was much smoother, and soon the pimples starting going away (for good)!|`|E28mQDX0aa	Like with any acne treatment, you have to be patient. I know Proactive claims to get rid of acne within a couple weeks, but that's just not the case for everyone.    I've been using Proactive for over a year now, and it took three months before I started seeing results and another three before I felt comfortable enough to go out without make-up. And believe me, I almost gave up several times, but I stuck with it, and now I can't be happier.     I would suggest that you continue with it for a couple more weeks and use a moisturizer since it does dry out the skin. If you still haven't seen results, or your acne gets worse, then you might want to stop use and either try another product or go see a dermatologist.|`|kbdkOPHDaa	someone else tonight said proactive made thier skin worse....    seriously, the best remedy for acne is a simple yet cheap solution.... everynight ise peroxide, soak a cotton ball with it and go over clean skin (washed with soap) and dont drink alot of soda, and more water... youll thank me for it : )

ROV3shkNaa	Products are made to paint the nail so the thumb tastes bad. Stopzit in one of the products. You apply it to the nail, let it dry then you good to go. If you put that finger in your mouth it tastes really bad. Other products are made. Ask your pharmacist he is free...|`|58abdcb0652955a0d84a28b08b3cab8eaa	If you want to wear braces you're on the right track. Thumb sucking causes the need for braces. I stopped because I got a retainer and could no longer fit my thumb inside my mouth. Perhaps you could sleep with a mouth guard, the kind they have for teeth grinders and that would crowd your thumb out?|`|VOccyg7daa	Rub a little jalapeno fluid on your nail.|`|UgS1Jpu8aa	Suck on a lollipop|`|5cdae57084e9f6937c40bc87aadc7941aa	start masterbating..|`|2Om1LosMaa	Are you embarrassed when someone sees you doing this? Imagine even when you are alone that someone is watching you, and you never know these days they just might be. You're obviously seeking comfort, find something else that make you feels good. Try anything with your hands, drawing, writing, typing, play video games etc... The experts say it takes 30 days to break a habit. You made it two weeks you can make another two weeks, one day at a time.|`|71mE0r7kaa	You just have to force yourself to stop. It will be hard since you have been doing it for so long. But remember do, there is no try.|`|4O77BGbwaa	dip you dip both thumbs in vinigar or lemon juice before bed. when you try to suck on them they will taste bitter...lol i dont know its an idea hope it helps!|`|pJ2Ew8qbaa	Hello,  I'm gonna give you some options whether you put a little bit of water at your fingers and dip into salt then leave it there anytime. Recommended that you put many salt and do it before bedtimes or night.. Do not put sugar.. or Vinegar like the answers above..  Next solutions is try using products that have coloured nails which you can combine your nail with the fake nails, but your must use some money which is not really recommended.. So try my first options which is easy and not using your money..    Okay, i hope that i helped you enough. Good Luck. Thank You.  Yahoo Messenger: lash_hiei95@yahoo.com.my
tS4t9Lndaa	Yes you must see your Dr. You need to have a holter monitor study, blood work and a echocardiogram done.Yes it could of been the caffeine.Yes this problem can be genetic. Palpitations are normal and usually benign. You need to identify if there any problems with your heart.    ha-ha  Go to the Dr.
tbFI2XJeaa	Drink milk 3 times a day, once in the morning (breakfast), once in the afternoon (lunch), and once at night (dinner). Drink a moderate amount. Do not drink too much milk at once as it will just pass through your body without absorbing any nutrients.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	If neither of your parents are taller than you are now, it is unlikely you will get very much taller.  As a rule, at about age 16-18 bone growth stops and your height is fixed from that point on.|`|5I6ZQUn7aa	yeah, you still can grow. you are only 16 now. keep doing exercises and eat healthy diet. you will reach 6ft tall in no time.|`|AOnNtUNLaa	No your body stops growing at the age of sixteen.
kA0xb0MVaa	Your weight can be a factor in how well your body regulates temperature.  Or it can signify many more serious conditions.  So there isn't enough information in your question to answer it properly.  An age range, height weight, any other medical conditions that you know you have or think you have would be necessary to answer this question properly.  I would love to help you so give more information and I will give you a better answer.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Poor circulation, low heart rate.     Try some regular cardio.|`|Ma0f4AfQaa	Being skinny.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Bad circulation, really skinny, Raynaud's disease....it could be alot of different things.|`|a261fd1a9071a01bb66837e9f2d41cf0aa	afraid of commitment? lol|`|6pwxjbZ3aa	Poor circulation due to coronary heart disease  Raynaud's disease (disorder that affects the flow of blood to the fingers and sometimes to the toes)  A side-effect of taking certain medications  An underlying disease affecting blood flow in the tiny blood vessels of the skin. (Women smokers may be prone to this).  Stress.....    ways to help....  Don't smoke. It impairs circulation.  Avoid caffeine. It constricts blood vessels.  Avoid handling cold objects. Use ice tongs to pick up ice cubes, for instance.  With fingers outstretched, swing your arms in large circles, like a baseball pitcher warming up for a game. This may increase blood flow to the fingers. (Don't do this if you have bursitis or back problems!)  Do not wear footwear that is tight-fitting.  Wiggle your toes. It may help keep them warm as a result of increased blood flow.  Practice a relaxation technique, such as biofeedback.|`|evmMYELsaa	Could be multiple things.  It's possible that whoever has this happening (I assume it's you?) could have poor circulation.  Or you could have low iron in your blood (that would be me... I'm anemic, and I get cold really easily and have difficulty warming up).  Also, some people just naturally have colder hands/feet.  Studies have shown that there are correlations between the brain and circulation according to temperament; introverts are more likely to have colder hands than extroverts are.  Interesting, huh?  If it gets to be really unnerving or unnatural feeling, however, I would see a doctor.  That was just the trivia I had floating about in my head. :/|`|f4JLJEo9aa	I would say that circulation in your limbs isn't good, but then again, I'm not a doctor. Try looking at WebMd, they have a lot of stuff that could help you out.
feyZ3bkBaa	Try not to fix it yourself. You might actually form it wrong and it can irritate your gums or teeth and possibly make your teeth align improperly. If anything, try to bring it to an ortho in your area that accepts your insurance. A few days without your retainer won't hurt, but make sure you get it fixed ASAP.|`|NEJeAx3Uaa	No you should just wait and make an appointment with your orthodontist.He will fix it.

5ac6279b4179229339c516533f3a5fa6aa	Well you can go forward with it, as C.u.m contains 99% of water and some proteins and some elements like that, including salts. there is no harm in licking it.  But if he have some sexually transmitted disease or He is HIV positive, then mind it, if you will lick it and any how it is mixed in your blood, like there is some scratches in your mouth or tongue or inside throat, it will mix in your blood and can cause same disease to you, but it is true that if there is no such type of thing, after swallowing it, it will readily go into your stomach and will be digested within some time and you will not have any effect even if he have STD or AIDS.  It is same like as, we can drink Snake's poison also and it won't affect us as it is 100% protein and water, but if you have any scratches or wound in your throat or mouth, you will have affect of it.  So just ask him if he has any of these things, if not you can drink it and lick it as you lick jam or jelly, no harm in it. and infact it is good also, if it is taken into good quantity, it have water salts and protein, it can help your stomach acting nice as Oral Rehydration Solution Does. which have sugar, salt and water. and is best for loose motions and dysentry.|`|dd4101e9e6d9ff7f2f829b06e9441cf6aa	Inappropriate. I don't think it will cause any ill effects. In the future, you may want to refer to it as semen. It just looks nicer.
