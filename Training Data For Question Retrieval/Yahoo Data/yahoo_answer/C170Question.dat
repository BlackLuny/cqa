20090222144330AAuhqWk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How many mom's work with a little one?	Lately I have been feeling so down!  I am at school 2 days a week for 7 hours, and now I work 2 days a week.  One 4 hour shift and one 6 hour shift.  My husband takes care of her when I'm gone because he works nights.  The schedule sounds perfect except....now my baby girl seems to be really attached to her daddy and really fussy when I have her.  And also, my husband and I hardly ever get to see each other.        Anyone else have a crazy schedule?  How do you manage everything?  My baby girl will be 12 weeks old tomorrow!

20090222144907AAuAa0x	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do I do when my mom is making my life even more miserable than it already is?	It seems like every night me and my mom get in an argument. We just did and I told her she's making my life miserable and she apologized and she left to the neighbors. I'm home alone for now. On top of all this, I'm going through the worst heartbreak ever (and I mean WORST). I just can't take all this sh*t anymore; I have WAY to much stress on myself. Right now I'm ready to give up. What do I do...=(
20090222144752AA63S89	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should i call my doctor!! or is this normal at 9 weeks? please answer?	i went to the doctors friday for my second prenatal check up and she used one of those doppler things to find the heart beat but she couldn't. she said that was normal at 9 weeks and we would try again in a month. before i left she told me some things to look for that could be bad like bleeding, period cramping and stuff like that and she said if i started to feel like i wasn't pregnant then that is bad too. well today i noticed my boobs don't hurt any more im not as sick as i use to be and i don't have to pee all the time like i use to is this bad? should i call the doctor? i just don't feel how i felt a week ago or a few days ago. i had my first ultrasound at 8 weeks and i could see the heart beat and everything but im so scared that there is something wrong with my baby.       sorry its kind of long

20090222144725AAnGi9a	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	3 months no period...negative pregnancy test?	Okay so I came on here before (about a month or so ago) and people said I was most likely not pregnant and to talk to my doctor.    So first of all I'm 18 I've had my period since I was 12 and its always been regular. I was pregnant once before when I was 16 and I miscarried. I took two home pregnancy tests then the 1st at 7 weeks and it was negative then at 9 weeks and it was positive. I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and we do have unprotected sex sometimes. I don't drink, smoke cigarettes, or take any drugs prescription or otherwise.     well this is what's been going on...   My last period was Nov. 7th on Dec. 9 I took a home pregnancy test and it was negative   Then I took another one on Jan.6th again negative   On Jan. 12 I went to Planned Parenthood they did a urine test it was negative so the next day I went to the doctor and they did a urine test once again it was negative and she suggested I get on birth control and ignored anything I said about maybe being pregnant. I also requested for an ultrasound and she said that it wasn't necessary. So since I wouldn't take the birth control she suggest I get my thyroid tested and also get tested for anemia because those could be reasons for a missed period. So on Feb. 3rd I got those tests and I have neither of the problems.    I told the doctor and her advice was to take another urine test in 2 more weeks and take prenatal vitamins just in case! I started taking prenatal vitamins but I haven't taken a test since Jan.13 I really would just like the doctors to give me an ultrasound.  I have no insurance and this is getting really expensive for me. I really don't know what to do both planned parenthood and the doctor did nothing for me. Please does anybody have any advice on what I should do??

20090222145523AAmD8W2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	OPK - Very confused!?	We have been ttc for a year now but found out in August that I have PCOS (which is now under control) I have lost over 2 stone & I my cycles are now a regular 35-37 days with ovulation on about day 20.      I got pregnant in November but sadly had a miscarriage in December 08.   My last cycle was a little messed up after the miss carriage but now back to normal.      I suffer with ovulation pains every time I ovulate but always back this up with OPK's but this time I have used Clear Blue Digital ones with the smiley faces & have got a positive reading for the past 4 days.  Is this a normal thing with these tests?      Also, we have only had sex once during my fertile days, will the chances of conceiving be lower?      Thanks  :)

20090222145243AAiCcnU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My 67 year old wife is pregnant with twins...? Kind of long!?	I am 69, let me explain the whole situation. So one day we had started to get bored with our marriage since we didn't do as many fun things as we did in our 30's and 40's so 5 weeks ago we decided to spice up our love life, so we had intercourse and I was wearing a condom, but I guess I had put it on incorrectly, (We haven't had intercourse for 10 or 11 years now) and we thought everything was going to be O.K. because she was 67 and she shouldn't be producing any more eggs, but one day she started to feel a little dizzy and she kept on feeling dizzy throughout the entire day, so we had taken her to the doctor and we had remembered the night we had intercourse so we asked if she could have a pregnancy test, we took the test and he had said she was pregnant with twins or with just 1 child, so what I am afraid of is could she die if she gives birth to twins? We are really worried, we don't know whether to get an abortion or to have the baby(s).

20090222150111AAAclSv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you know anybody that just doesnt seem the motherly type? Sorry its long...?	My sister in law is pregnant with her 1st and due in 3 week. The thing i just have no idea how she is going to cope!   I speak to her and she just doesnt seem to care at all, or understand that there is actually a baby in her stomach!   When we speak i am actually bewildered by the things that come out of her mouth and by her actions. For example...   On new years eve she planned to go out and drink despite being 7 months pregnant. She claimed to be 'sick of not being able to drink'...so yeah i saw her out with a pint of lager in her hand...it looked horrible!   Then she smokes heavily and states that it has no effect on her babies health. She smokes on after another and doesnt even seem to feel guilty about it.   She definitely does not want to breastfeed, she said its disgusting having a baby 'stuck to you all the time' like that and actually said "eww" lol How can one find a baby breastfeeding disgusting?   She claims another reason that she does not want to breastfeed is that she wants to use Speed to lose her pregnancy weight when he is born..surely you cannot care for a baby at the same time as being whizzed off your face right?!   Oh and she has already planned a schedule on who looks after her baby on what days. I think she claimed 'her days' was like 2 days a week!!   I just thought wtf!! How the hell is she going to cope because she has no idea what it takes to take care of a baby!      Do you know anybody who was/ is like that? Did they seem to get the idea of being a mother when they baby was born?    I feel bad for the baby to be honest!

20090222150325AAqXSuN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My mom... what is wrong with her!?	My Mom is so evil.  She doesn't have a heart at all!   I ask her if I can go over my friends house, and she   always says no, even if we are not busy.  She gets   mad over the simplest things.  Example:  I ask if I   can have some food and she will tell me I eat too    much and tell me to go away.  It's not even true I   am almost anorexic!  But that is not the biggest    deal, something else that she does is yell/scream!   SO loud, she scares me.  The only reason she    yells is for the stupidest things like asking if she    can take me to the mall.  She is also very jealous   of people.  I tell her that my aunt will be staying   with us (she is battling cancer!) it is also the aunt   on my Fathers side.  She starts getting out of    control and is mad for the next week.  My Mom    also never wants to spend time with me.  I miss   the good times we use to have together when I    was little.  She never laughs.  She hits me and   smacks me and doesn't give a crap if I cry my   eyes out!  I try to sit down and talk with her but   it just gets worse.  Her temper is out of control   and I never hang out with friends because of her.   She is over protective in a bad way.  Sometimes   she just stops talking to me, and I did nothing   what so ever.  I do my best in school, keep my   room clean, try to be kind, but she never gives me   the respect in return.  My dad says that she has   no heart, and thinks the same of her as I do.   I wish I could just have a nice mom, sometimes   I cry myself to sleep, just wishing I could have   a mother, like my friends'.  My father won't    devorce her, and sometimes I wish he would, all   my parents do is get in fights and yell and scream   at each other, just like I do.  Oh also, my Mom    calls my sister fat, and says I am stupid sometimes,   she swears at me in Portugueese (her 1st language)    and she is just SO mean.  Please help me someone   please, I beg you, I can't take it any more!! ):

20090222152430AA32jAf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents what would you have done about this dog....would you have kept him around your kids for this long?	Why or Why not.      Would you have waited this long to take action?      I had this dog for 3 years when I was a kid      In the 3 years we had him.....he went after two of my friends...bit one.  Got into a fight with an american bulldog and a golden retriever.   Tried to attack my 2 male cousins from inside the cage....actually flipped the cage down the stairs from the inside.    And before the end of things turned on my mom.      All the while never harming or attempting to harm myself of my sister.   ____________________________   Here is his story:      When I was a kid I had this Shih Tzu.      We got him when he was 7 months old and he was kept in a bathroom for most of his life. From what I understand someone else who had him....beat him with a newspaper and a belt. And a kid had him before and wasn't very nice to him.         Well we got him and he was fine for about 2 years but then one night my mom was laying in bed reading and Pongo was under the bed and she heard him making some whining noise and then she heard a thump and he was shaking.....      He had had a pretty big seizure. Well in the two years leading up to this he had started having some issues.....mainly agression. They worked hard with him...read books on training....they never took him to classes though.      He became very agressive toward men and children. He had another 2 small seizures before he was 3.       Around the time my sister was born my grandfather told my Parents "That dog has to go"      And they wouldn't do that....he had never shown any agression toward me and they knew that dog was my best friend.      After my sister was born he turned on my mom       and after 3 years with him....my grandfather took him to the shelter.      A shelter worker actually took him home that day...problems and all. She thought she could help him.      I was 10 years old when I lost my best friend.

My dad's dropped me off at his parents' house.  They've taken care of me since I was little and I've hardly seen him.  But he's been around a lot lately.  Recently he lectured me about not walking home alone.      Just now he's started in on it again.  He's bound and determined to have me stay in the house unless I've got someone with me.  I don't know what I did to earn this fuss.  He's already told me not to leave the house alone but now he's doing it again.      I don't think he has the right to tell me what to do.  He's hardly ever been around for me, rather be off in the army.  But do you think he has the right?

20090222152036AANMmx5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	How long do I have to take Birth Control before I can try to get Pregnant?	Background info:      Ok, I have been trying for a year to get pregnant. About a month after I started trying my period went away. The Dr. did blood test and apparently nothing was "wrong" however my hormone levels were all so low that no period was coming and I was not ovulating. The dr. prescribed me medicine to induce a period (which worked) and then Clomid to help me ovulate. After three cycles of that and no pregnancy I started getting periods on my own. The last natural period was on Dec. 20th (first day) and then I didnt have another one until Feb. 1st. When the one came on Feb. 1st it did not go away and was REALLY heavy. I am talking about a Heavy Flow Overnight pad and the highest absorbency tampons only last 15-20 minutes, at night they need to be changed every hour and there are blood clots that come out every hour that are the size of a fist. After 15 days of bleeding like this the Dr. prescribed Provera to stop the bleeding which after 2 days of taking it stopped the bleeding, however it only stopped it for 3 days and then I started bleeding again even heavier than before. (I still had 5 days of those pills left when the bleeding came back) so then the Dr. told me that I would need to go on the birth control pill (even though IM grying to get pregnant) so that my periods can regulate and hopefully make me start ovulating again.       My Question is how long do I have to take the Birth Control pill before it will regulate my period/cycle so that I can get pregnant?      When I was a teenager I had really irregular cycles and OBGYN always said he didnt think I would be able to get pregnant, he put me on birth control then and I have two children that were both conceived while I was taking birth control (so I havent taken it in 4 years because it wasnt effective as bc)

20090222153658AA4SCpa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My daughter is 3 and she stopped using the potty, help!?	My daughter is a little over 3, and she has been using the toilet for about 4 months.Lately it has been a huge struggle to get her to use the toilet. She even refuses to try unless we threaten to take her toys away. We started with the nice approach telling her "you tried and it's ok as long as you go on the potty next time". It kept going on and we are at about week 3 and we have started cutting back her TV and playtime when she does it, and still that hasn't worked. We have had sit downs and tried over and over to explain to her, and nothing seems to be getting through. She does have a brother and he is 8 months old. I don't see a jealousy issue she says she does not want to be a baby so I am at a loss. Does anyone have any other ideas to get her back on the right track?

How would a little girl feel toward there mother she is told that her mother has no idea who her father is?  It can’t be proven either way if her mother is telling the truth or not.

20090222154307AAfroUt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you look for in a daughter?	My dad doesn't love me and hasn't talked to me in.... abooout... 3-4 months? That's when I was in hospital and he kept calling to shout at my mum. Before you think calling's a good thing - he called the hosp. and asked how I was then the nurse said do you want to talk to her? And he said no, just pass the message - which was how much he loved me.. What?! Lol      Anyway, he comes to the door every friday or saturday to pick up my sister and again saturday or sunday to drop her off. He doesn't ask how I am when he's with my sister or at the door. For my birthday, he gave me a card and it said 'I'm just a phone call away' Eer, he hasn't talked to me or wanted to see me in months!! Lol and it had a ￡20 in it and no present and that's be OK if my sister didn't get a ￡30 game every week or so. And for xmas I got an incomplete art set that was on sale which would be OK but it had NO thought in it - I haven't painted in ages or even been interested in art since he was still here like 2 years ago.      Anyway, I'm 15 and suppose I'm an OK kid, I do good is school, I don't lie, do what I'm told. I forgave him but if he's not trying, what am I to do? Run after him like he's doing nothing wrong? He's making our lives hell by using our mortgage on booze, cheated for YEARS, doesn't make an effort generally.      I don't want anything to do with him, and if he hasn't changed by now, he never will so there's no point. I've done OK 15 years without him, no point having him around.            What do you look for in a daughter? My mums friend says he's be proud to be my dad and I'd like to be his daughter, but what can do! Lol      He is a friend btw not with her!! He has a wife and daughters that are both in their 20's (or 30's I don't know) and one has a girl so no :P      So - what would you like? What makes you LOVE your kid?
20090222111628AAsZGyq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ladies.... TTC & Ovulation?	okay..      I just asked this question in womans health and got some rather stupid answers.      So ill ask in this section!!      Well my fertile days has been this weekend. we done alot of babydancing but I found that I was bleeding after sex on fri night and again to day!       The blood seems pink (sorry tmi) but I think that might be because it was mixed in with the semen...      I know this may sound so stupid... but can the bleeding be related to ovulation...? Is the cervix alot more sensitive and soft...(which could maybe cause bleeding)      Thankyou for your help!!

20090222155036AAEta5v	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why do people feel the need to do this..?	I ask a question.. And some genius out there rights: "I think you should try to integrate syllables or letters of the fathers name, so that you'll always be reminded of what a f***ed up filthy sl** piece of sh** you are. Girls like you are the scum on this earth that neglect the kids that end up as serial killers. Guaranted you are going to end up swallowing *** to pay for daipers and I hope for your kids sake that child services take her away.   Source(s):   Your other questions. You dirty wh***."      ^^ Why do people (mostly is the pregnancy and parenting sections) feel the need to answer rudely.. I mean, it isn't their live and they don't have to answer.   Does this bother anybody else?    =[
20090221115614AAoDEu7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Baby refusing breast...?	Hi all,     After my baby started losing weight and was having dry nappies at aged 3 months (having been exclusively breastfed until then), I was advised to top up with formula. She has shot up in weight since then and is a much happier baby. I normally feed for 15-20 mins on each breast before offering a bottle, and she'll normally take a good 4 or 5oz too. She's actually a very big baby now, so we know that she has been feeding well.   Today, she has refused the breast at every feed but one. She had a brief feed first thing this morning, but despite trying all day, she won't take it. I'v been deeply upset by this and spent a lot of today crying about it (and she's had a good cry about it too), and now she's asleep for the night (I assume).   I did try several times until she was literally hysterical come each feed time and caved with a bottle - I had to after an hour of trying.   Is there any way I can encourage the breast again? What can I do to make her feed? I'm not a believer that 'formula is poison', but I love the bond and I'd like to keep going with breastfeeding.
20090222155534AA3Hxrc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My friend got her phone taken away?	I texted my friend last night and didn't get a reply till this afternoon.    It said "phone taken away". Obviously her parents still have it.      My friend is 17. When I first got my phone at 15(19 now) my mom took it away a few times when I was 15-16 but 17+ I never got it taken away. I think a few times my mom tried but I would never hand it over and it cost money to have it temporarily disconnected, she'd just give up. (I literally cannot go without my phone.)       This isn't about me though, this is about my friend and what gets me the most is that her phone is on and her parents texted me.    Her parents have full access to her phone. They can see everything and are using it.       When my mom took my phone, I would either only give her the phone and no battery or I would lock it and shut it off and it would need a password to get to anything once it was turned back on. Same if I got it taken away at school.   I would have been in shock and flipped out if my mom had gone through my phone like that and did what my friends parents are doing.    I mean its one thing to take the phone away but it is totally another to to keep it on, go through it and intercept messages like that.       Teens:   1.What do you do when your parents take your cell phone away?    Do you give them the whole thing?    Do you take the battery?    Do you lock it?    Erase the messages?   2.What if you found out that your parents were intercepting text messages like that?   3.What do you think about this?            I know the whole her parents pay for they can do whatever they want thing but there is such thing as common decency and not totally invading privacy like that. When my phone was taken away, my mom kept it off and it went into a nightstand in her room. (Oops, how do I know that?)      Parents:    1. When you take your teens cell phone away what do you do with it?   Do you just shut it off and hide it somewhere?    Do you go through it(contacts, pics, messages) and then shut it off? Do you keep it on and see what comes through?   What if your teen shut it off and then handed it to you?    What if you turned it on and found it locked?    What if you saw the inbox and outbox empty?   Would you ever intercept messages like that?         I know it may seem like a lot but it is not.    I am just curious because what happened with my friend is outrageous to me.         Yes, this is posted in adolescent as well.

20090222154939AAdnYj9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Disgusted with some other parents right now?	Here these people I work with who have kids promise me they are all going to come to my daughters birthday party. I spend 200 dollars on food, 5 large pizzas, huge cake, veggie tray, wings, the whole nine yards. Not a single one shows up; and they don't even have the DECENCY to call me and tell me they are not coming. I think that is very rude and luckily my neighbors came over with her 4 kids and that made it a "party" that and my one girlfriend from out of town with her sons. If it hadn't been for them nobody would have come at all; my husband said I should just be greatful my daughter had a good party, and I am greatful but I feel so hurt that people are so rude. If I tell someone I will be at their party, I will SURELY let them know if I change my mind and don't come. What is wrong with these people? And all of this after they bully me into buying "goodie bags" for their kids, they said I had to make goodie bags. Now I have a closet full of goodie bags; Does this normally happen when you plan parties anyone?

20090222111222AAWTYDy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Need suggestions for setting up a learning area for my 2 year old any ideas?	I want to set up a small learning area in my dining room so i can start teaching my two year old and also allow him somewhere to be creative since it's the only space available with no carpeting. Already have plenty of children's books for him and he tries to read them. Also have a huge ABC poster that he is working with to learn his ABC's and have tons of paints,crayons,markers etc. that i let him use. Don't think it's very necessary to buy an art easel b/c he has no problem using them as far as not painting/coloring on things he isn't supposed to. So if anyone has any ideas on other things i could buy or use for this area please add your suggestions. I know maybe 2 is a little young to start teaching him reading but he seems like he really wants to read books so i figured i'd give it a try.

What should we do now? we don't want to disregard the doctors advice, but are skeptical of the results of their tests, and the testing method for that matter.

They are very bulky and stiff, limiting her range of leg motion and they seem to cut into her tummy a bit. They button and we have had one skin pinching episode so Velcro would be nice.  Soon our baby will be growing out of the ones we have so we are looking for a new brand.   What cloth diaper brand do you use? Why do you like them?

My doctor said ANY time, I am just wondering how long it was for YOU after you had these signs.   Here is what's happened so far:      As of friday, I was 3cm dilated, 50% effaced, and she didn't say the station, but that he'd dropped more (was previously at-3). I already lost a HUGE mucus amount, not blood tinged. Then, yesterday morning a HUGE blood clot of mucus with NO hint of ANY color except DARK red. I had alot of cramping and back ache. Went to bed and woke up at 2am with HORRIBLE cramping, felt like I had to use the restroom, and I had crazy diarrhea (sorry tmi!). All day today, saturday I have had period like cramps, back ache, pressure that FEELS like I have to have a BM, and more occasional loose BM's, also more TINGED bloody mucus.   I am due on tuesday (feb. 24th). Just trying to get an idea of when labor will start, because as of right now we don't have our car. The baby is also moving ALOT.   When did it happen for you??

20090222122326AAlSgoa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	At what age did you take away the bottle?	My son will be 11 months in 2 days.  I know it's not time yet- but I don't want to wait until the last minute to think about it.      He doesn't like any sip cup YET- we keep trying.  He was born 7 weeks early- but doesn't seem behind in any way.      He doesn't mind (trying) to drink out of a regular cup-    He does NOT hold his own bottle.   My mom took me and my sister's bottles away on our 1st birthday.   If my son doesn't like a sippy cup by the time he's one, should I take the bottle away to get him to learn faster, or should I let hiim have the bottle and keep wotrking on it?      I will note:  when we was eating out of a tube in the NICU and learning to eat from a bottle- he COULD- as in had the capability to eat from a bottle, but would get stubborn and wouldn't- almost like he was "lazy" and knew he'd get fed through the tube if he wanted.  I don't know if that's actually possible- but it's what it seemed like.      Maybe one is too early for him- but I also don't want him to be the 2 year old walking around with a bottle.   I will be talking to his DR about this at his 1 year, but would like to know opinions and experiences.      Thanks!!

MY period normally lasts 2 days, and that's how long this slightly heavier spotting lasted. I read something about "break through bleeding" ..What is that? Thanks!!..Oh, by the way, I am not worried I'm miscarrying as there is no pain what so ever and there were only 2 string like clots. I've been doing allot a research, I'm only curious if I could have had a slight period and if not, then what?
20090222114938AA9H2Tv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Terrible twos or adhd?	i'm sure she's hyper. she never sleeps, only about 3 hours a night. she'll lie in her cot and kick at it laughing all the time, she's always running around, doing things she knows she shouldn't do. she hits me and screams and cries like i've hit her if i tell her off. she's always screaming for one reason or another and it always sounds like she's hurt herself. when we're out she either wont stop laughing and running about or wont stop screaming if i keep her in one place. i love her, but even at my young age i have absolutely no energy for her by the end of the day (which is the main reason i let her cry it out). if i try to get her to sleep she'll scream and cry more so it's just a case of bath, PJ's, bottle, bed. when she isn't screaming she's laughing, which doesn't seem like such a problem, but it's so shrill and loud it makes my ears gunk up and pisses the neighbours off.

Put a stop to the relation and either force or coerce the child(meaning their kid...not an actual kid), to marry someone of the parent's liking? Then when the marriage goes array, the parents almost always blame their kid. As if the union was supposed to go splendidly. And they always maintain...we only wanted their happiness. Is that only something parents say but don't mean? Or is there more to that incomplete sentence? Just curious of what's behind this logical madness.

20090222124655AAtYZwe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you handle a child who is screaming and misbehaving in a restaurant?	OMG! Last night we  had a perfectly good dinner ruined because we ended up sitting in front of a family who's child acted like a brat the whole time we were there.He was screaming, crying, running around almost tripping the waitresses, kicking the seats..ETC. and the parents were completely oblivious to the whole situation, they didn't correct or discipline him in any way. they actually tried reasoning with him like he was an adult...Now I usually do not tolerate spanking but this child needed a good whack on the bottom.      Now being a nanny that is one thing that I will not tolerate, and my girls have always been well behaved in restaurants because that is what is expected of them. They say please and thank you to the waiters or waitresses. and sit quietly and color or play.      They also know that if they are not behaving I will pay the bill and leave, they learned early on that I mean what I say.      Why do children run the households now instead of the parents.

20090222125626AAqIW6b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is there any easy way to say this?	I had another tal with my 11 year old daughter this morning about personal hygiene and it really seemed to upset her an hurt her feelings.  I took her in my room for privacy and explained that sometimes people don't know that they have a body odor and that it's always just good practice to shower often and use products like deoderant and others to maintain a fresh body scent.  Since we had this talk before and I didn't get to personal I felt this time I had to be a little more specific in order for her to understand where I was coming from.  I just mentioned that if I can smell her, than its a possiblity others can as well and seeing that she's in Middle School her peers might not be so nice about it.  She was so hurt and I feel like a complete *** for having to tell her, but I'm not sure what else I could have done.  We've had this conversation before and it hasn't seemed to sink in.  I apologized for hurting her feeling and explained that I only want to help her and its all apartof growing up and learning oneself but she still seemed so upset.  Is there any way I coul have done this differently or can make her feel better now?

20090222124715AAViP0l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think the spanking and grounding questions are real?	or just trolls?      I saw teens say they were grounded for "3--6 months" or some ridiculous amount of time, no TV, phone,,, etc....       The spanking questions can't be real.  Spanked at 14?  Right.......

20090222115418AAqSvgY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is it harder to feel baby move if you are overweight?	I'm 20 weeks pregnant and still haven't felt my baby move yet.  With my first pregnancy I felt her move by 18 weeks.  I never lost the baby weight from my first pregnancy (60 pounds) so I was wondering if this could be why I am not feeling any movement yet?  Does it take longer to feel if you are heavier?
20090222125548AALmkjA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I convince my husband to have vasectomy?	I'm pregnant with my second baby and my husband and I have both agreed that we only want 2.  Every time I mention Vasectomy to him he refuses to talk about it and tries to change the subject.  I've explained that its a much simpler procedure for him to do it than me.  I also explained that if I have the surgery and it doesn't work I could end up having a tubal pregnancy which would have to be aborted (I would have a really hard time with that), but if he has it done and it doesn't work we would just end up with another kid (I would rather that than have to have an abortion).  I also told him there won't be any sexual contact after this baby is born until he gets it done.   Did anyone else successfully convince their husbands to get it done?  Can anyone explain to me what exactly is done during a vasectomy and what the risks are for it being done incorrectly (he is worried that they may cut too much off or something)?  Would it be a good idea to have him get it done while I am still recovering from childbirth since we already won't be able to have sex anyways?

20090222113514AAhrFhO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Breast change during pregnancy..?	I'm nearly 37 weeks pregnant now, in my first few months of pregnancy my breasts became larger and fuller, but recently i've noticed that they are the same as they were before getting pregnant, if not a little smaller.. is this ok? Should I not be producing milk at this point? does it indicate a problem atall ? I havent gained much weight during my pregnancy - i may have lost a little its hard to tell with the size of my bump!
20090222122858AAxzdmX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Is this the answer you're looking for?	Yes, you could be pregnant.   Yes, he is cheating on you.   No, she is not interested in you.   Listen to your mom.  No.   No, it isn't fair.  But life's not fair.   Yes, you can lose that unwanted weight.  It will require that you burn more calories than you consume for an extended period of time.   No, I will not help you with your homework, unless you can do something for me in return.   Call a plumber.  Or an electrician.  Or a mechanic.  Or a contractor.  Or a lawyer.  Or an accountant. Sure, these people are expensive, but it's their job to know their profession and to give you expert help right the first time.   Get a divorce.   Apologize.   Ignore the child psychologists.  Ever dealt with their kids?  Ask your parents, or better yet your grandparents, and deal with your kids with a firm but loving hand.   Listen to your kids' teachers.  If you are having an issue, your kid probably is having a problem and you probably haven't been helping solve it.     Get over the fantasy of your kid getting a full athletic scholarship.  That happens for a tenth of one percent of high school students.  Help them develop homework and study skills instead, it is way easier to get a full academic scholarship.   That should satisfy about half of the questions that arise on here....

Anyway, they obviously get in more trouble than me and it can be embarrassing when we are at the store or when I have friends over, because I try to be good. When they are acting up my mom will sy something like “do you need me to spank you?” or “if you do that again I will give you a spanking.” Even though shes not saying it to me I feel weird because then everyone knows I get spanked too. What does your mom say to you as a warning? What should I do? Isn’t it bad that she says shes going to spank them in front of my friends. What should I do?

20090222120758AAH3R9p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Can you say no to babysitting your grandkids without feeling guilty?	We always get a last minute call for babysitting from my husbands daughter. We love to babysit but its like we have no life we are just waiting to get called.      We both have very demanding careers and try to help out 2 or 3 x a month.    Lately its a last minute call about a drs appt.or visiting her grandmother  and then disappears for 3  hours.       Oh and we have to sit at her house and the dishwasher could be emptied if we have time.  Then there's a table full of crafts that we can do that she bought. (which she has usually already promised the kids 1 & 4 that we would do)      Sometimes we have both just come from work and are not int he mood for this.       This is not my daughter so I can't tell her off.    If it was believe me I would tell her she is lucky that we do so much for her.       What do we say? Her Dad is starting to notice as well.      I can't really say anything to him because its not his fault.      And I dont feel it's my place to say something to her.      Dont want the drama.

20090222114816AAtpmV8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to get 5 month old to nurse without stopping to play?	My son is 5 months old.  He is exclusively breastfed except for a little bit of rice cereal 1 or 2 times per day at this point.  He has always been a healthy eater (he's up to 21 lbs already), but lately he is more interested in playing than nursing.  Whenever I try to feed him during the day, he starts off well, but once he is no longer very hungry, he keeps popping off the breast to look around, laugh, grab my face, pull my hair, etc.  I cannot keep him interested in nursing for the life of me -- if I try to "force" him to keep eating he will scream.  The reason this is a problem is that he never gets a full "meal" and is hungry again less than 2 hours later.  Is there a way to keep babies this age interested in nursing until they are full?  Thanks!

20090222113746AA4mTPr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Girlfriend - brown/black period blood, did not bleed heavily, short period?	My girlfriend starts her period between the 15th and 20th, but almost always the 15th. She started the 20th. She said it was a darkish brown color. She's never had this problem before. She also said that once or twice it looked black. Her blood stayed dark brown the entire time. I asked her if she was bleeding heavily like she always does, she said it wasn't bleeding that heavy at all. She also did not have any clots, and with her MTHRF disorder she always has pretty bad clots. Her period barely lasted 2 days, and now there is no sign of bleeding at all whatsoever. I've done tonsss of research. Some sites are saying that it is dried up old blood that has been sitting in there forever. But her blood was brown the entire time, and she never bled heavy. Some sites are saying these are signs of pregnancy, but it's hard to tell or get a positive result right away. So what do you think it is chances are? And how long should she wait to take an HPT?

20090222133140AA5jQ8k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What to say to my 8 year old when he says this?	My 8 year old son spend 2 weekends out of 3 with his Dad. He and I are on great terms-we were high school friends. He also spends some holidays there.       When he's there, though, he often spends the night at his grandparents (his dads parents). Now, while I know he loves staying there, I hate his grandmother and she feels the same about me. I even heard her calling me some very unpleasant names when I was 2 weeks from giving birth! I keep a civilised face around my son as it's not fair to punish him.      Okay so when he comes back here after staying with his grandparents, he is often upset and asks to go live there. He wrote me a little note today and left it outside his bedroom door saying he wanted to live at grandmas. I don't know what to do. He is NEVER living with her (even his dad agrees there) but she is his ally against every 'evil' I have ever done. If i tell him off, send him to his room, don't let him have treats, everything I don't do, she lets him do.       What can I say to him? I have tried saying that he can't live there because grandma and taid work, i've tried saying that we'd miss him lots, all sorts. It makes no difference. He only ever asks the day he comes home and when his dad and I sit down with him, he says he wants to be able to live with everyone.      I guess I just want to know what is the best thing to say to him when he asks to live with his grandma? Am I saying the right things?

I went straight to my next pack this week to skip my period and I don't want to jump to any conclusions but my stomach feels like its a little bigger this week and I feel somewhat bloated. I am scared there's a chance of pregnancy but also it could be me freaking myself out because I will not have the reassurance of my period this month to tell me I'm ok. However, I don't think "feeling bigger and stomach hard" is a symptom. I haven't had any other symptoms as of now. I won't get my period for 2 more weeks. Can someone help?       And please helpful answers only.

Will she just except some food in time without a bottle.  Weaning is confusing the hell out of me :( .

I had two vaginal ultrasounds: one at 8w 6d and the other at 12w 6d.  I saw a baby that was developing well and had a great heartbeat but maybe I am just getting ancy.      This is my first pregnancy
20090222133538AAfZGyi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	8 days past ovulation. is it too early?	I'm 8 days past ovulation and my breasts are killing me and I have cramping on my left side where my ovary is, and I've been so moody and irritable (my poor boyfriend). I no it sounds alot like before your due on your period but I'm not due on for another 12 days. Before anyone comments and says I'm confused with my ovulation I/m NOT! my cycles are 50 days long and I always ovulate on day 25 I no my body like clock work coz I get the pain and the discharge and the temp and the smiley face on the stick. and I have always fallen pregnant this way. I'm never early for my period either, my body is like clock work. I just wondered could it just be my body playing tricks on me coz I am so desperate?      Thanks x
20090222141704AAYiO4X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Help!!  I think I need to take the morning after pill...?	I made a huge mistake last night.  I drank a lot and ended up having sex with this guy.  I only remember the night in bits and pieces.  I feel so ashamed, and scared, and angry at myself.  I thought those days were behind me, getting drunk and the following day not remembering what happened.  But obviously not.  So, my dilemma is that I'm not sure if we used a condom.  I remember we went and bought them, and every time I have sex I make sure I'm the one to put it on the guy so I know it's definitely on...but that part is a blurr from last night.  I'm thinking I need to take the morning after pill just to be on the safe side.  I'm praying he didn't have anything, like STD's and at least with the MAP I can stop worrying about pregnancy.  Any advice is much appreciated, thank you very much.

20090222134451AAo3R8p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How did your husband's behave while you were pregnant?	My husband has been completely uninvolved with this pregnancy. I am 6 months pregnant and he has been working 75 hours a week, and when he is home he just wants to have his own time to relax (which is understandable after working all those hours), drinking beer and watching movies. We have a 2 year old son also and it is really difficult for me feeling like a single parent all the time and being pregnant. I have talked to him about reducing his hours, but he always says we need the money. But we don't need all of it. He could seriously work like 55 hours and it would be more than enough. I just don't know if this is typical Male behavior during pregnancy or if it is something more. We have also been having some serious marital problems this entire pregnancy. Just days before I found out I was pregnant I found out he was cheating with me on the internet and frequenting several porn sites a day, and we have been working on that in counseling. So I know I have been really insecure this entire time and maybe even a little irrational at times, thanks to the added hormones into an already unstable situation. But how did your husband's act while you were pregnant?

20090222133241AA32Pub	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	More of a 50% chance of having a babyboy?	So im only 9 weeks, anxiously counting the weeks til i know what im having =]   Id be perfectly happy with whatever im having, im super excited and cant wait, but in my heart ive alwaysss wanted a little girl.   Ive kind of blocked out the chances of having a girl in my heart because I know the sex is determined by the male.. and my partner has a family of boys. Not one girl, not a cousin or anything. A family of males.  5 brothers, 2 of his brothers just had babies ones about 5 months and ones almost a year.   2 boys of course.   So everyone is expecting the little boy in his family.   Is it really still a 50 50 chance of having either one?... it just seems like im 90% going to have a little boy like theres no chance ill ever have my little girl
20090222133653AAAMmFB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I be pregnant? Help!?	My husband and I have had unprotected sex, I have been on birth control since November 2008, but I'm not too good on taking it at the same time every day. My last period was on Jan. 28, 2009. Lately I have been feeling really strange, I keep having this pain in the lower left side of my abdomen, my breasts have been feeling weird, everything is tasting funny, and I can't stand the smell of cigarette smoke. Is there any chance I could be pregnant?      I have to go to the gynecologist tomorrow, so should I mention any of these things to them?

20090222141137AAgbnUO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I had a "period" but am really nauseous.?	A typical period for me is one day of light spotting, the one day of really heavy bleeding, then one day of medium bleeding, then spotting, then nothing.      I started my "period" on Feb. 10... right one time BUT this time I spotted for 3 days a dark brown color then by the end of Friday evening, I was bleeding what seemed to be an actual period, but it still wasn't really heavy, then bled like that until the morning on Saturday, then spotted the dark brown color again, then nothing, then the next day I had another dark brown spot.  I decided to take a HPT just in case and I had a very faint negative line and I had followed all the directions.  Today I'm feeling very, very nauseous and almost threw up twice today and have had a knot in my throat.  I'm feeling fine otherwise so I don't think I'm sick.  Do you think I could be pregnant or is this just a fluke that I'm feeling sick?

20090222141807AAW2vsI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Help me please!!!!!!?	Okay, first I want to say that I have NEVER had sex or any form of sexual activity. Is it at all possible for a guy to have raped me without me or anyone else knowing, like with that date-rape drug(I don't know the name). The reason I asked is because I feel pregnant and I look pregnant. I am usually very very very skinny and everyone knows it. Now my stomach is puffing out a little bit and I am feeling all weird. My last period was about 2 months ago...so it is like overly late. The weirdest part is that when I feel where my stomach is puffing out, I think I can feel a heartbeat. Please help me solve this!   And , if it turns out that I am pregnant, Could it have hurt the baby when I went ride the four-wheeler today? And will it hurt it if I horseback ride later on this week? I can't get a pregnancy test because I am a teenager and if my mom found out she would think that I have been having sex. Is there any way to tell if I am pregnant?

20090222144402AAOrK0v	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	19 month old likes to "help" cook... but...?	My daughter likes to help out with everything that you do! When I am doing dishes, I pull up a chair and she "rinses" the dishes for me, when someone is cooking she wants to be right there with you to help, but it is very unsafe when cooking on the stove. If you don't sit her on the counter or hold her she throws a fit! I don't like sitting her on the counter because she will always end up crawling to the stove. (I know sitting her on the counter is unsafe, but whatever we have never had an accident and someone is always within reaching distance from her). I usually just ignore her and let her throw her tantrum. But, what are some ways that we can 'involve' her in helping with cooking?
20090222143933AAQd4pu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is my baby girl slow?	She is now 5 months and she still has little problem supporting her head. its ALMOST there but not quite. when shes lazy to do tummy time she will just lick the floormat... just today when i woke up she was laying down horizontally with her foot sticking out of the crib.  i dont know if this makes sense but normal way to sleep in vertically on the bed but she was laying down horizontally. I have no idea how that happened because i never even seen her try to lift her body. do you think she might have been practicing while everyone is asleep???  I hear babys around her age can already lift there body up to try to sit up. when should i bring this to pediatricians attention?
