I have a friend that was just given a section 8 voucher and now needs to find a place to live.  The voucher is just enough for the full rent for a low end apartment in our area (Fort Walton Beach-Panhandle).  Housing cost is high in our area because of the past hurricane damage driving available property costs up.  How do you find a place that accepts Section 8 (other than calling and asking; meaning is there a list of section 8 landlords somewhere...housing didn't provide a list)? How does she afford a deposit with Section 8?  Does she have to pay it or does housing?  Is the voucher all she gets to start? Serious answers only please.  Any information would be appreciated!

I bought a house here and property prices have gone up quite a bit. I'm concerned about the global credit crunch and have put my house on the market. It's worth well over $1M now.      Problem is: Where do I put this money? I'm worried about bank failures. Bank deposits aren't insured to the tune of $1M+. But, if I were to keep the money in cash, I'd probably have trouble buying a house later on because of money laundering laws (you can't just deposit $1M+ in cash).

20090225155251AA8qVR8	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Charging us for normal wear?	So our old landlord sent us the itemized bill within like a day of it being 30 days... she is wanting to charge us our whole deposit plus $300 to cover normal wear.  We did leave the place "broom swept" condition, however no we did not go the extra mile to have the carpets cleaned or the oven cleaned (however everything was maintained while we lived there.)  Charging us for things like a garage man door that wouldn't lock (which was used by the other rental people connected to us...it was a shared door.) Charging us for the carpets being cleaned ( $250!) Air duct cleaning...(Isn't that normal wear?) Nail holes!!  There were nail holes when we moved in..yes we added some, but how can she charge us for nail holes when there is no way she can tell if they are from us or not... and we stated when we moved in on the inventory list that there were nail holes.  Does all of this sound right?  Can she actually charge us for all of this?  In our lease it states that if the place is not left in the same "clean" order as it was upon move in then $175 would be deducted from the deposit...which would be fine, but she has gone way over and beyond.   Also we are supposed to pay her the water/sewer, she has never in the past gave us a "real bill" only a slip of paper stating how much we owed... and then we always paid it.  Back when we gave our 30 days, she mentioned (in e-mail) that she would be sending us the bill soon...we never received one nor did she ever send one.  I am wondering since it has been 30 days since we left and we never received a letter or a bill stating what we owed...do we still have to pay it?  Or being that the 30 days is up, is it just forgotten?  It's odd that she has not said anything about it, she didn't even add it in our deductions from our deposit.      Sorry a lot of questions...but we just don't know!  This is for the state of Michigan.

The problem is no one will give me a credit card (the only way I know to earn credit) not even department stores like Kohl's or Macy's. I get rejected and they say the problem is that I have insufficient credit information. I also found out that lenders will give a card to people with bad credit before they give one to a person with no credit at all. This seems like an impossible situation for me because I have no credit so I can't get a card, but I can't earn credit because no one will give me a card. What do I do?

I owe 15 years on this house that I am tired of renting and need to sell it rather quickly. I have a lifelong friend who I trust very much and have agreed to sell him the house on monthly payments until he can get his credit cleaned up or a co-signer. Without going into a long story, his credit is in a mess because of his recent divorce from an ex-wife who ran up thousands of dollars of credit card bills, and other things shortly before she left him for another man. Anyway, I know I will get my money and I know he will eventually get all this cleared up, my question is... I want to protect myself and him by making up some kind of contract that we can each sign and have notorized. What kind of information do I need to include in this? I want a fair contract that protects the BOTH of us. Please offer suggestions. Oh and please, no answers involving NOT selling the house in this manner. I am going to do this, I just need to know how to draw this up. Thank you.

Is this correct?    Also, will I still have the additional $30K+ in my account, or will the $27,000 that I don't pay back reduce that additional amount?

I lived in my previous apartment for 4 years and did not have a buf problem did not no bedbugs even existed always thought it was a sayin until now.

La ley dice: las transferencias, por concepto de pagos a la cuentas de tercero en un mismo banco se gravaran con un impuesto de x cantidad. Mi pregunta es, porque cuando yo me sobregiro en una cuenta mi balance aparece negativo, al otro dia cuando deposito se cobran el interes y la comision por ese balance negativo y mi cuenta vuelve a la normalidad (es un proceso transparente y no me cobran ningun impueto por transferencia). Ahora, en otro banco cuando me sobregiro, ponen toma de fondo y mi balance se pone en 0 al dia siguiente cuando deposito, ponen reintegracion de fondos y debajo cobro de interes y comision y mas abajo cobro de impuesto por la transferencia, lo mas extra?o es que si mi cuenta se vuelve a sobregirar el mismo dia de la reintegracion se olvidan de cobra el impuesto. Gracias por prestar atencion a mi pregunta.
