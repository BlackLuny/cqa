20090226160343AAWh73n	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Can women find two men kissing attractive?	I know it's a bit of a silly question but if you for example show a bunch of guys a picture of two beautiful women kissing they most likely go something like "That's hot"      Just wondering if they same could be true if you turn the tables and show a picture of two men doing the same to a group of women.

20090226162216AAguZ1W	Social Science;Psychology	How can I better deal with my anger?	I very rarely express my anger and as a result it's been building up inside of me for years now, every single thing that has ever p*ssed me off has been sealed up inside me. I'm pretty insecure and shy around people I don't know very well so I rarely act upon urges of violence even if someone physically hits me I usually just try not to do anything back...       In fact, I so rarely act upon urges that in my entire life I've only ever physically hurt someone once, some guy ran up behind me and jumping kicked me in my lower back for no reason and he kept running so I picked myself up and ran after him, within seconds I caught up to him; I then jumped and grabbed him round the neck with my right arm and slammed him to the ground head first with my full weight and momentum. After that I walked off, as far as I was concerned I'd had my justice and there was no point continuing the fight since he was down and unable to fight back.      Everything since that moment has been locked up because I'm too shy/insecure to express myself when something gets me mad so I fear the next person that pisses me off like he did is going to get a face full of concrete and probably worse since I've had so much sh*t lately.      How can I deal with my anger and negative emotions better so that I can avoid this, currently impending, 'explosion'?

20090226164232AAjjdKX	Social Science;Psychology	How do you feel about Octomom?	While she may not be a bad mother, her children need to be taken away from her, in my opinion.      She already has six kids [a few of them are handicapped] and she's going to be bringing home another eight soon!      She is unemployed and lives with her mother in a home that is struggling immensely to fit the six children Nadya already has!      I think the woman needs to be sterilized and those poor children need to be given away to people who can provide for them and give them everything that they need to live a happy, healthy life.       I was watching Dr. Phil today and I agreed with what he said.      Nadya's living in a fantasy world and her ability to predict the consequences of her actions is, obviously, non-existent.      The doctor who agreed to plant the embryos in this unequipped mother's womb should be fired.      Nadya seems to be a loving mother and that is  a wonderful, precious thing but love isn't going to pay for her kids' food, clothing, medical bills, diapers, et cetera.      I try very hard not to judge the woman because I don't know her personally but she strikes me as unintelligent.

20090226163247AAtp0gp	Social Science;Sociology	Why do people give out Social Security Numbers to strangers?	I work for a company that deals with online ordering, and over the phone ordering. Usually we ask for a Name, Address and a Visa or Mastercard number to take their order with, we're very careful about shredding all the paper and we have tight internet security and whatnot.      Sometimes, a customer will need order information or something and usually all we need is a last and first name to look them up. But usually once or twice a week, people will offer me their social security number to help look them up. (This usually occurs in the pause between 'hold on a moment let me look you up' and 'how do you spell your last name' they usually ask it between there) Obviously I reassure them that all I need is there name and don't say any more on it. But like I said, this happens once or twice a week regularly, from people all across the country and from various ages.      I do know that SS numbers only started being issued to babies in the 80's and that before that, you got it when you got your drivers license.  (I'm talking about my parents time, 50's & 60's, my SSN  was issued the day I was born) The state of Illinois gives them as medical licenses (only on certain kinds of medical licenses and I wont say which kind).   (INFO: "Before 1986, people often did not have a Social Security number until the age of about 14, since they were used for income tracking purposes, and those under that age seldom had substantial income. In 1986, American taxation law was altered so that individuals over 5 years old without Social Security numbers could not be successfully claimed as dependents on tax returns; by 1990 the threshold was lowered to 1 year old, and was later abolished altogether. Since then, parents have often applied for Social Security numbers for their children soon after birth; today, it can be done on the application for a birth certificate.")      No wonder there is such an issue with identity theft, if people are just giving them out to random strangers! Do people not realize that if I were a less honest person I could take that and steal all their money or something. I mean seriously..do they not realize it..or what?      So..my question is..why would you offer someone your social security number? Especially an e-order company? Do people not know that you shouldn't give it out? What are your experiences with this and have you ever offered it to anyone but your bank/school/federal agency/employer. I understand those more, but we're just an e-company, so why give it to us, we've never asked for it. Your order it, we ship it. That's all.      Thanks for your answers, I'd really love some insight on this!

Women      Should be treated with respect   Not like meat and it’s not right to cheat   Just want you to listen   It isn’t that hard or you’ll be dissed   Like to cuddle   Now that isn’t much trouble   Want a sensitive guy   So it’s okay to be a little shy   Are like cats always need attention and to be pet   If you think I’m wrong we men make a bet   Like to be held they are beautiful   Also any compliment is also good and plentiful   Need their men to always be there for her   Also need to hold them dear   Like to give hugs and get hugs   Anything and anything like that except drugs   Kisses are good by touching those soft pouty lips   Even looking at those curvaceous hips   A women’s body is too hot to handle   Like moonlight walks under the midnight candle   A women’s body    Hands are cold and are good to be on a warm man so I’m told   It’s too dangerous to look at her curves   But it’s never good to get on her nerves   In red are too hot to stand next to   If you say something mean to her you’ll get burned   You just got to say something cool to put out the flame   Once you do you’ll be able to tame the dame   Women’s bodies are a work of art   Just by looking at that hourglass figure so fragile and sensitive   Just remember guys it’s all from the heart.

Curious: If restaurants and other public places had LaZyboys and beds, would you be more likely to go there? Suppose (to avoid transients), they had a 2 hour limit, but you can read in bed during that time.       Or what if more public places like libraries and restaurants had dividers so that you wouldn't hear the noise of other people - and you could just lie in bed.       I know this is a very strange question......but I wonder why I prefer to read in bed rather than sitting up.....or is it just an ingrained habit?

I didn't like to shop (at all, for anything anywhere), and I wasn't girly at all... (horse lover and all that), and I didn't think about guys that much. I never wore dresses or skirts. This was all last year.      But now I'm way more into guys, makeup (put it on for my very first time by myself today), and I really want to go shopping for clothes with my best friend, who by the way, totally understands. Now I'm a little more snotty (oh, my, GAWD!) lol, and I really want to try on these frilly, amazingly beautiful "prom" dresses at the mall at Teeny Tiny, but not buy any, since I'm in eighth grade as a 13- year- old. I'm not that much into horses anymore, and I've been making a lot more of my own choices that had absolutely nothing to do with my friends (wrestling) (I'm weird like that).

20090226171733AAgLlCT	Social Science;Psychology	Is it possible to be an introvert and still like to talk?	I really like to make people laugh.  But if I'm with people I don't know, I just stay by myself and think (which I love to do), and I'm completely fine with doing so.  I am really good at being quiet and hate group projects.  I, unlike everyone else in the class, would prefer that the teacher makes the seating chart, because, unless it's like my best friend, I don't really care who I sit next too.  My favorite part of the day is after I get home from school.  At night, I love to sit in my bed and just think, and I do this for hours some nights.  I am sad in the morning when I wake up and realize that I have to go back to school.  I try to avoid most social events like camps, socials, retreats, etc.  But I'm not sure if that is because of the social aspect of it or not.  But like I stated before, I love to make people laugh and am known for cracking jokes, but typically only to people I know and trust.  I get embarrassed very easily and my speech is filled with "umm, ahhh, ummm, what was I saying" very frequently, because my mind is always abuzz and it's pretty hard for me to focus when I'm speaking.  I hate people looking at me, and I can't look at people while speaking.  I don't know why that is.  I'm 13, and I don't know if I could say that I acted like that 5 years ago, so I'm unsure as to whether my true personality is introvertedness or not.  Also, if only 25% of the population is introverted, than I don't know if my personality is rare enough.  But, then again, alot of stuff goes on afterschool that I don't know much about. (like people going over to other peoples houses, going to the park together, etc.) I can not imagine myself doing that every day.  I have fun with  other people, but I need time away is basically what I'm trying to say in all of this.  And I don't go crazy if I'm not with other people.  Sorry for the long, boring post.  So the question is, do you think I'm introverted?  (I know myers-briggs and all is sort of pointless, but I really enjoy this kind of stuff)

20090226175310AA6Xxtr	Social Science;Psychology	Very uncomfortable in my class?	Ok, so here it goes:      I'm in high school, taking a physics honors class.  My teacher kind of creeps me out, I mean he is a good teacher but he is rather eccentric.  Just his mannerisms and such, and the way he calls on random people in class to answer a question when you least expect it.  I understand what is going on in class perfectly, I am perhaps one of his best students, I just feel very uncomfortable in the class.  He also calls on people to read things from the textbook, like I said before completely random.  For some reason I get nervous in class because I am afraid he will call on me, this has never really happened to me before until recently.  Last year I became very self-conscious and I get nervous very easily, I am even convinced I have an anxiety problem.      I feel so awkward in that class.  I don't know what to do, I have been struggling with depression/low self-esteem issues for quite a while now, and this situation is only making it worse.  To top it off, I have to give a 10-15 minute presentation to the class next week!      I feel like I am becoming less and less able to handle these situations, I need someone to give me tips on how to overcome this ridiculous, irrational fear because it will hold me back in life.  I am also prone to stress, I am taking difficult courses, and I am also an straight A student.  The pressure is becoming too much sometimes, I feel like I just want to escape it all.  Next year I will be a junior, I don't want to have this problem for the rest of my career as a high school student.  I have tried talking to my mom but I am sick and tired of feeling like this.  I was very excited for this physics class but now it has become a living nightmare.

But in the last 5 or so years it has really intensified. In just about everything i do i want to cry.  I will watch a move/show on tv and something on it will be sad or really happy and i start to cry.  same with songs.  I just dont understand.  People tell me it's because I have a big heart.  I kinda get why i cry when i see something that saddens me, but i dont entirely get why i cry when someone in a movie/show is happy.  ex: I am watching tv and someone finds out they are going to have a baby and i see them happy about it, it makes me cry.  maybe its because im afraid im not going to have kids, i dont know.  Maybe im crazy.  I sometimes feel crazy sometimes because of this problem.  If this is some kind of disorder, is there any help for it, or cure.   If someone can please shed some light on this problem for me it would be appericated.  Only serious answers ONLY!!

For the women: A world without men.   2. For the men: A world without women.    3. A world with population control measures. (think hard)   4. A world without religion.   5.

I want to know if anyone is surprised by the results.      1.  43% said it would be hell.  Most of the rest didn't care either way.    Ironically, the one person who thought it would be hell was also a man even though I was only asking the women.      2.  86% said a world without women would be hell.  Half of those were women.  No one said utopia.  (Men appreciate women more than women appreciate men?)      3.  57% believed population control is a necessary evil.  Half were men, half women.  29% said it's not possible because it goes against fundamental rights.  The other 14% were undecided.      4.  50% of men and 60% of women said no religion would be utopia.  The other 50% of men and 20% of women said it would be hell.  20% of women were undecided.      5.  No one thought a single monarcy would be utopia, with 57% thinking it would be hell, 43% undecided.      6.  50% thought a one-race world would be hell.  The other 50% was undecided.      7.  Almost 60% thought a world where race doesn't matter would be utopia.  The rest thought it wouldn't matter.      Some interesting facts:   -100% of people who thought religion was GOOD, thought a one-sex society would be hell (possible religious reasons?)   -75% of people who thought religion was BAD, thought population control was necessary   -100% of men believed a single monarchy would be hell, vs. 40% of women.  The other 60% were undecided.      Of course, this sample size was small, it would be more useful to have more people answer these questions.      So is anyone surprised with these answers?

20090226184320AA3AgK2	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does it mean if you dream of a tree falling onto your house?	OK... SO I had this dream last night about a tree falling onto my house... well not my house but my mum's house, which I moved out of a while a go now... But I still think of it very much as my house because I visit often and I dont live very far from it. There is this large tall pine tree in the neighbours yard. When I was a kid I was somtimes worried that if the tree fell down it would maybe land onto our garage and damage it. We had a big back yard so I would not have reached the house.      Anyway,  this is what happened in my dream: I was in the backyard. I noticed that the tree was suddely leaning over, about to fall down.... In my dream the tree was closer to the house, and I was worried that if it fell onto the house it could hurt or kill my mum who was in the house. I was watching this from our backyard (which was a lot smaller in the dream than in real life).      Then suddenly it did fall down. It wasn't a big thunderous crash as I would have expected but it did fall down. It turns out that the house was undergoing renovations and all the tree did was damage some air conditioning ducts and perhaps a little bit of roof damage (wierd I know!)      My thoughts were that this will slow down the progress of the rennovations and the construction. I was annoyed about this.   --------------      Anyway I have some idea of what this might be about but I would love to get your opinions too. Thank you.

It all started about 6 months ago something happen major in my life that might keep me like this forever, never in my life i had smelled so bad in school for those last two periods of classes and it has not stopped. I don't smell that coming from me anymore but it's still a smell that i and some notice. 1st months oh i'll change this next three months why won't this go away 1 month later [yelling] I can't take this any more. This month going into my birthday "forget everything i can't take it i can't handle it im going to the army or a mental hospital. As you can see i used to be normal but i think i drove my self into a paranoia schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and insanity person. I live in a city full of parties and now i don't even go to them no more, i notice that i used to talk to this girl in school and i sit right next to her but because of this damn smell i don't want to be next to anybody. It seems like everywhere i go someone says it stinks in her or something and i will think it's me and know it's me. My mind is starting to get away from my friends and school and girls and i just sit in class thinking of how not to get close to people but i used to be close to people so they all hang around me. Don't anyone tell me what to wear like antiperspirant  deodorant and how to wash up and what soap to use because like all people who end up kill someone after they told a person they needed help did want they had to do but got no help. And on top of that i get fussed out by my mom everyday for stupid reasons and anything she can make up which has been going on for about 8 years. Im stressed and i can't take any of this any more. I told my mom about this all even her dumb fussing and she gets mad and say its in your head. What can i do about this all im just tired of living like this, and what should i tell my doctor on monday because of this.

20090226191429AA9xvrY	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is there any potential problems with talking to beautiful Asian girls?	I looked her in the eyes and felt i couldn't look away because she looked so divine. She was hearing head scarf of some description and i was only able to see her face.      Obviously not something i planned for and was taken by surprise as i was walking down the street - she noticed me looking at her and i smiled as i looked down, i felt a bit shy it seems. When i looked up she was smiling back and said "hi" as she walked past. She looked so happy :)      I didn't say anything which i regret but i didn't expect and was kind of dazed. Usually i'm confident but i've never spoken or received a smile from an Asian girl before - this was quite an experience.        Now i feel empty inside like there's something more i'm missing out on - i don't really know who to ask without sounding very nieve, but is it okay for me to talk to Asian girls even if they're all together in groups?   I don't see many other of my friends talking to them so is there some kind of invisible rule or guideline i might not perceive?   Does religion have anything to do with it?      Please take this question seriously, i know it sounds a bit silly but i'd really love to hear what you people think about this type of socialism.   And also is it feasible for me to have a girlfriend who is Asian without people making a fuss over whatever?

20090226190302AA77mUA	Social Science;Psychology	Ever have an experience that changed your life completely?	I used to be really anxiety-ridden and nervous-- for years, even decades. Then, the other day in one of my classes at school we did this activity where all at once people were asked to make animal noises as loud as possible. Which noise you were supposed to make depended on what letter your last name began with. Most people in the room weren't loud at all when we made noises as a group, but I thought, what the hell, I'll be as loud as possible. My voice dominated and it seems like I've completely relaxed since this experience. I used to worry about how I would appear to others so much, but then found that when you just let go of the worry and fully participate in life nothing horrible will happen. I feel more "real" now than I've ever felt in my entire life because unhealthy amounts of anxiety aren't dictating my behavior any longer.

I think people who think like that need to take a course in economics and learn how money really works. Not an intro level course but a real economics course. Someone just asked why is President Obama punishing rich people.       Do SOME of you not realize that the only way the rich get rich is by having a middle class that is able to work and make money and spend their money on products? I hate to hear people say that President Obama is punishing the rich. My family is rich on both my mother and father's side of the family and if it is one thing my uncle will tell us is. "Always respect the middle class, they are the driving force behind the American economy and even the economy of the world."  What will it take for people to realize this?

My dad and I aren't too close, so I can't talk to him about anything personal.   My sister is close to me and vice versa, but she's younger than me, so I can't go to her for most issues.   Lately, colleges have been sending stuff to me, including letters inviting me to visit their campus and consider their college when I apply next year.   I don't know why, but I want to get away from New York City.   I love the city and the people, but I have this feeling that some time away might do me some good.      Then I also remembered when I was little and sometimes now, at times I would feel unloved.   I've only made friendly acquaintices at school and no one from school has become my best friend or anything like that.      As the colleges keep sending in letters, I get more and more anxious to get out of the city and somewhere else, where I don't know anyone and I can start over completely fresh.      Can someone give me some advice about how to deal with all this depression until I get to college?   Sorry this was so long, but I needed to get everything out.
20090226173825AAmFBe6	Social Science;Psychology	When around a group of people, and they suddenly start laughing at a joke you don't find funny, how do you act?	When around a group of people, friends or family, and they suddenly start laughing at a joke or an action another member of that group made, then how do you react when you don't find it funny or other such emotive reaction is followed or required?       And is your response different from the rest of the group?      Do you pretend to laugh?  Or do you mimic the same response of the group?      Do you feel awkward?  Or perhaps embarrassed you don't understand?  Or do you think you know 'better' than the rest?      Is a mixture of etiquette, self-awareness and mimicry needed in order to please the group?  Is it a diplomatic response and a need to please the other members of that group?      If you feel you don't want to stand out from the crowd, then why pretend to do something you don't want to do in the first place just to 'fit in'?
20090226191800AAqLigM	Social Science;Anthropology	Dalmatian Croats. Are they the most ancient Europeans?	Forget about the Basques in Spain, I think that the Croatians in Dalmatia are the original Europeans according to recent genetic studies. They have the highest proportion of Haplogroup I (70%) - a haplotype that putatively originated in Europe and the highest MtDNA haplogroup H (60%) in all of Europe. Interestingly also, I think, like the Basques they have a high proportion of Rh negative individuals. What are your thoughts?

20090226181146AAIia6T	Social Science;Psychology	Is There A Explanation For The 'I Know It, But I Just Don't Know' Feelings?	This is the strangest question I have ever asked....Well, throughout my days, sometimes I had some sort of thing at the back of my mind, a thought of some sort, but not represented through words. What are they anyways? This is too complicated to explain via letters!       Uhhh, a example is when you know it, but you have nothing in words to support it with? (Kind of like when I posted the question 'What alignment would you be if you lived in a fantasy world?' For some reason, I thought villain, even though I don't want to be one!)    I know, stupid question, but I'd like to know how I do it. The state of mind is very important, because I could of sworn that I only knew half the questions at last year's testing, but I ended up scoring in the high advance range. Each time I was about to choose a question, the feeling acted up, and I chose a different one.) Is this feeling a fragment of memory of school, that I can't mentally remember it, only instinctevely?       Yeah, I know I'm weird. x_x

I am a twenty one year old female, and it seems no matter where i go, its always the creepers or unstable guys that are drawn to me. Not just to the point of making comments, but of taking action. I have had many people, women and men comment that i am beautiful, but it gets a little tiring after a while. Men of all ages seemed to become almost obsessed, and because of it i have had several scary encounters the last few months.

My therapist gave me her cell phone number a few months ago in case I needed to call her in an emergency...lately I've been calling her quite frequently (once every other week).  Tonight I called and she told me I need to stop.  She said she wasn't mad, but I started bawling and I feel so terrible and mean for doing it.  I feel like a stupid idiot.  She said for me to stop thinking that I was her friend.  But I don't really have any other friends.  She said she likes being my therapist but for me to stop thinking that we are friends...I don't think she's my friend and I told her that it's just that she is the only person who understands me.  So now I want to die in a fire.  I don't want to see her again because I'm so ashamed, but i'm afraid she'll think I'm mad at her, but I'm not mad at her, I'm mad at myself.  I hate myself for doing this.  I hate feeling this way and being stupid and weak and having to rely on her.  I want to crawl in a cave and die.
20090226191837AA1eKnx	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Abusive men & Submissive women?	I got this from an anti-domestic violence site:       There can be an attraction to dominance and authority that appeals to some submissive people. Some dominant men are charismatic. The pressure to conform is so great that the person who has tendencies to be submissive gives up free choice. The romantic bond in some relationships keeps the couple locked in a love/fear cycle. The one who is berated appears to desperately need the berater and vice versa. The use of anger, guilt, fear and manipulation coupled with physical and sexual often causes the submissive partner to shut down.      The dominant person may have some form of psychological instability or an antisocial personality. They develop entitlement beliefs and seek partners who have high degrees of guilt and submissiveness who are easier to control. They suffer from a power addiction.      MY QUESTION: Do you believe that abusive men seek out women who have more of a submissive nature or not? What are your thoughts?

20090226190053AA0ib6S	Social Science;Psychology	A mental conflict, pill addiction?	well ive never really talked about this in full..but here it goes.   in 8th grade i started experimenting with pills, which i can say was the biggest mistake of my life. i took things like vicodin percocets (starting out small)..i continued on into 9th grade, which i kind of brought my game up a little, if you will. i started taking seroquel, ritalin, valium, trazodone, and probably some others. ritalin was my pill of choice, i got the most effect from it. when i took it i was in my own world. so whenever i would get upset or stressed at school i would pop one with the hope that it would make it all better. living that way just brought me down to an all time low..i would be depressed nearly every day of the week. then i started taking things thati  wouldnt even ask the name of...("here justin, take this!" "oh sure dude"). that was when i tried valium and trazodone, but i didnt really tread in that water for long at all. i just wanted my ritalin. would take them during schools several times a week not caring who knew it..if i made people laugh from being high, it made me happy. so then i tried seroquel, which i way overdosed on and ended up passing out from. i was in class (just like every other time i took a pill) and popped it, some people were saying that my face was white and blue, and i was feeling sick..so i went to the bathroom, although barely able to move because my body was so numb. by the time i got there, i passed out on the floor in front of one of the toilets after puking uncontrolably it seemed. from that day on i never took another pill again, and now almost a year later in my sophomore year i look back being proud for quitting. i mean really, not many people can do that all at once. but even now, i get random urges to go back. when i get really really upset or depressed i get the urge and dont know what to do. ive been sober for all this time, but the urges just mess me up so badly. i get depressed even more because i think of what it did to me, and how i still want to go back to it..i would be hurting myself once more, and it makes me feel like pure scum. so basically, at this point, i dont know what to do. im terrified that im on the brink of turning back around without being aware of it. i mean the urges arent like terrible, but when they hit me they really hit me. i didnt take as many pills total as you might think, but the amount doesnt matter. it messed up everything and thats that. what do i do? i cant let things go out of control, im a straight A student and a generally great kid and i dont want that to be lost. help, please..i need it so badly.
